00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,813
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to All Games Radio.

2
00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:08,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up next, Orange Lounge Radio, live.

3
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:16,952
[SPEAKER_05]: The following program is intended for mature audiences.

4
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:31,563
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.

5
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:58,617
[SPEAKER_10]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:05,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And here with you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Not here yet.

9
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,602
[SPEAKER_10]: She's running a little late tonight.

10
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:09,523
[SPEAKER_10]: TechMasterLoki.com

11
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:32,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

12
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:33,146
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Loki?

13
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:34,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing okay.

14
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:35,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

15
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:39,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously everyone knows why I was off, but how was your time off?

16
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:45,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you just kind of ended up getting a show off and had some time to yourself, even though you didn't have to get operated on.

17
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,616
[SPEAKER_10]: But how did you enjoy the time off?

18
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:52,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what I did last Sunday, to be honest.

19
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I played games.

20
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,217
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had something similar happen where I left my cell phone at work once and I had to use my key to get in the building to get it so it was very late at night but you know I can't live without my cell phone alright well you started talking about games like Fable 2 so we'll ask you how was your gaming week Loki and we always like to start off the show with a little bit of that

22
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:33,293
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week was alright.

23
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play that many games because I do have plenty on the plate to play.

24
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to finish some before I move on to others.

25
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play Fable 2 a bit.

26
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:47,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly to cheat.

27
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And how I cheated.

28
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me count the ways.

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,560
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I cheated to get lots of money.

30
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:58,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And the easiest way to do that is buy lots of property.

31
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And then time travel.

32
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:23,544
[SPEAKER_09]: and rinse and repeat and do it again and again and again so I have lots of money now and then I decided to get lots of experience and the way you do that is you get a second controller and you turn it on and you create a henchman with the same stats as your own and you sell off their stats and it goes into an experience pool and you buy more stats and rinse and repeat until you've maxed out everything

33
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:25,184
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I did.

34
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:26,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I did all that.

35
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:30,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I played a few missions, and I got bored with it because Fable 2 is very monotonous and boring.

36
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:33,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So I decided, I'm going back to Saints Row 2.

37
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:37,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And Saints Row 2, I basically played the hell out of that.

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,852
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, now I am almost done with the game.

39
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like two missions left, I think.

40
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And that game is awesome.

41
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:45,935
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a lot of fun.

42
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:48,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiplayer, I've been kicking ass at work.

43
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:48,936
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, they're

44
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:50,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of hating me.

45
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:53,498
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't like playing with me anymore because I keep winning.

46
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been winning with like over 20 points.

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,282
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tried playing some of the online multiplayer, but the matchmaking takes a long time.

48
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not really fun.

49
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:12,846
[SPEAKER_09]: The ranked games, just the weapons that they give you, the different play options, it's not varied enough.

50
00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:14,687
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's alright.

51
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:20,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, I've been playing a lot of the side missions and stuff in the game as well.

52
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And just a lot of activities.

53
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate, you know, Saints Row 2.

54
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:29,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a game I'll be playing long after I'm done with the story mode in it.

55
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't really touched Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since I got Saints Row 2.

56
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:35,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't plan on it.

57
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:40,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, we'll have to see what the expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 is.

58
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,578
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just not over the top enough, I guess, for me.

59
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,352
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

60
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:03,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've got one more world left and then I'm done.

61
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,275
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really cool.

62
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Slightly offensive still.

63
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:09,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's lots of stuff that I just laugh.

64
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:16,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Like my friend's character after we got the Arab parts in the India level.

65
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:17,769
[SPEAKER_09]: His character's...

66
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting, to say the least.

67
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,571
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just leave it at that, interesting.

68
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:28,692
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a fun game, and it's very amazing to see all the stuff that you can do in it.

69
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:35,573
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the thing, now if I want to make my own levels, I don't really know what I want to do because there's so much you can do.

70
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,994
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like there's no direction for me yet, I guess.

71
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:38,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

72
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, let's see, what else did I play...

73
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I played the Mirror's Edge demo.

74
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy crap, is that awesome.

75
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:55,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I downloaded that and haven't played it yet.

76
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,350
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.

77
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is going to be a game that I'll probably wait to get a little bit until I finish a few more things because I've still got Lost Odyssey.

78
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So I gotta go back to Mercenaries 2 and finish that game.

79
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Mercenaries 2, oh my god, they're doing some crazy shit with that.

80
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:24,010
[SPEAKER_09]: They added a new update, which I haven't downloaded yet, but it adds a bunch of cheat codes and stuff in there, which is cool, because that game is really cheesy anyways, and to be able to just blow up everything at a whim, I guess, would be really fun.

81
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,392
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're gonna have downloadable characters.

82
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:28,654
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gonna have Obama and Sarah Palin.

83
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:29,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh lord.

84
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:30,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be funny.

85
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:31,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

86
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:33,867
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

87
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:51,814
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

88
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,584
[SPEAKER_09]: That's basically what I've been playing this week.

89
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:17,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Fallout 3.

90
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:21,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a free copy from Bethesda, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

91
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:24,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to start that game when I have two other games I'm working on right now.

92
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:25,550
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just too much.

93
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And I probably won't play it until I'm done with maybe Mercenaries 2.

94
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:34,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to finish Lost Odyssey so I can be done with that as well.

95
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a lot of stuff.

96
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and I got Resistance 2.

97
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:39,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the other game I played.

98
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:40,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Resistance 2.

99
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:41,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

100
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,663
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I really liked Resistance 1, but I haven't gotten too far in Resistance 2 yet.

101
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not liking it as much as the first one.

102
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what it is, is there's not a lot of setup.

103
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a lot of just, oh my god, action, action, action, action.

104
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:59,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is not a bad thing, but it's not...

105
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:09,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Resistance 2 was one of those games where I was actually, when I finished killing everything, I got a moment to kind of catch my breath and like, oh my god, this is a beautiful looking game.

106
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,461
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is just, it's too much.

107
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:12,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Just too quick.

108
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:18,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll have to see if that paces itself a little bit better later on in the game.

109
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,223
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's been good.

110
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:23,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fun game and I look forward to playing that when I get done with some other stuff too.

111
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:27,104
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the chat room is on this kick with Mirror's Edge now that you've mentioned it.

112
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think this is going to be like the next big gaming IP?

113
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... It'll be big, but I don't think it's going to be really huge.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be about as big as, like, say... Maybe Assassin's Creed, but I don't think it'll be as big as Assassin's Creed.

115
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:42,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

116
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,291
[SPEAKER_09]: But it'll be fun.

117
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's one of those games that they could add, like, you know...

118
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,117
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

119
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:10,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to check it out.

120
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:15,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not usually a big fan on the first-person games, although I do love Oblivion, so you never know.

121
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because it's not really a shooter.

122
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,445
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't really call it a first-person shooter, right?

123
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,508
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of a first-person, free-running sim.

124
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I do love Portal.

125
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking love Portal, and that's kind of a first-person.

126
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,493
[SPEAKER_10]: You shoot portals, so who knows?

127
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:34,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Hitstun in chat says, Mirror's Edge looks great, but I think the controls just aren't natural.

128
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:38,260
[SPEAKER_10]: CaptainYesterday follows up and says, you know, I thought the controls felt right.

129
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,661
[SPEAKER_09]: They're okay.

130
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:44,383
[SPEAKER_09]: It just takes a lot of getting used to because, like I said, I kept falling off the building a lot.

131
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:49,887
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to join in the chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Anything else for your gaming week?

132
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:50,867
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

133
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:55,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me answer the questions in the chat room because some folks have been asking about the gallbladder.

134
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I'm here, so I'm doing fine.

135
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,694
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer what Marin in the chat said...

136
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:03,974
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:30,420
[SPEAKER_10]: They did not do video, so I'm sorry we don't get to do the YouTube and I don't get to do the whole Katie Couric thing.

138
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And they didn't put it in a jar for me.

139
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:38,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't really get to... I got knocked out so fast I didn't get to ask to keep it.

140
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:46,264
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did get pictures of it, which you can't really see on Justin.TV, but I'll walk it up to the camera later.

141
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,165
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, Loki?

142
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:48,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my gallbladder there on the left.

143
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:51,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky, did you vote?

144
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I went and voted.

145
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,157
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very important thing.

146
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope y'all did too, no matter what you did.

147
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you did go vote.

148
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:11,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I voted on the monorail.

149
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, bullet train.

150
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I was pro-monorail.

151
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:16,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did vote.

152
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I was well enough on Tuesday where I went out to vote.

153
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:28,091
[SPEAKER_10]: If I was a little worried, because it was a week between my surgery and the voting time, I was still in a little bit of pain, but I was able to get in the car and go vote.

154
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,013
[SPEAKER_10]: If I didn't think I would have been able to do that, I would have just voted absentee.

155
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:31,954
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

156
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:34,074
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm doing great.

157
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:35,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel a lot better.

158
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ready to go back to work tomorrow, believe it or not.

159
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:43,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just had a nice time away from all things my usual life, including OLR.

160
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to download it in case you haven't done it yet.

161
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:48,559
[SPEAKER_09]: The free LittleBigPlanet skins that they have, the costumes.

162
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:49,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I already did.

163
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are funny.

164
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got my GameStop ones, too, because they gave me a card even though I didn't pre-order it.

165
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:55,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

166
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:55,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

167
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:56,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted a card.

168
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:58,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, not that I really care.

169
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,333
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other DS game I actually checked out, my dad was nice enough to go out and I asked him to pick me up a game and he did it.

170
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

171
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:26,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play for a little bit, but I'm going to be honest.

172
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:34,238
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as my thoughts on the game, I don't remember a lot of it because I was kind of on Vicodin most of the time I played it.

173
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:36,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't really remember it at all.

174
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:40,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I do, I remember thinking it was very much like...

175
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:42,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my thing with Castlevania games.

176
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:46,060
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, they're starting to feel very similar to each other.

177
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,265
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a lot of innovation going on with the games, in my opinion.

178
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,408
[SPEAKER_10]: They've all been very Symphony of the Night-ish.

179
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:57,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're waiting for some innovation, wait until Castlevania Judgment comes out.

180
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:58,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll innovate you up the ass.

181
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:07,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to say I didn't like it, because don't get me wrong, Symphony Night is one hella good game, but every time I play one of these games on the DS, you know what?

182
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,005
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me miss them on the console.

183
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,648
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, I found it to be rather difficult.

184
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:15,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I was having a real hard time getting past, like, I think the second boss.

185
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:19,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I'm that far into the game at all, because I can't get past some boss that should be really easy.

186
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,139
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like right in the beginning of the game, it's like a crab that's climbing up the wall or something.

187
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:23,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

188
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,561
[SPEAKER_10]: But keep in mind, Vicodin.

189
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not really at my peak.

190
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:33,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll probably go back and revisit that game and have some better, more collective thoughts on that.

191
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you try to hit it for massive damage?

192
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:39,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did try to hit it for massive damage, and it wasn't working, apparently.

193
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:45,407
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because it only applies to... I didn't have six axis on the DS, that's why.

194
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:46,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't work.

195
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:52,989
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do have six axis on the PlayStation 3, and that's where I spent the majority of my time.

196
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:53,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, I gotta read this.

197
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta read this comment in chat.

198
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Marin in chat says, Castlevania, Vicodin of the Night is the best game ever.

199
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:04,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, any game on Vicodin is super great, especially Mario Kart.

200
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:14,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, the other game I spent far more time playing when I was much more sober was a game called LittleBigPlanet.

201
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And as far as my thoughts on LittleBigPlanet...

202
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

203
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:24,299
[SPEAKER_10]: It is one of the best games I've played in a long, long, long time.

204
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the sense of humor in the game.

205
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the graphics look great.

206
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:35,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great that we have a 2D platformer on the PlayStation 3 with 3D elements.

207
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:42,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I think even as a standalone game, the story mode, albeit a little short, is pretty darn good.

208
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:44,194
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com

209
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:06,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

210
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:28,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

211
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:50,516
[SPEAKER_10]: All the clones are never going to go away from the top page.

212
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:00,890
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

213
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:58,201
[SPEAKER_10]: and then it was interesting some levels I played you actually could unlock little stickers like I think I got a sticker that has a picture of Dirty Harry on it because somebody held it up to the camera and that was a sticker I unlocked because people were holding things up to the camera like in Bobby's level you know our buddy Bobby who does the show before us Bobby Blackwolf on allgames.com he has a level he did during the beta and as a part of that you can unlock the all games logo and a little logo from his show that is very similar to the gamer picture he has on Xbox so

214
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:21,282
[SPEAKER_10]: so but that's not a copyright issue because he put it on there himself but that's kind of neat that you can unlock those kinds of things when playing the community levels so and to be honest even if you go in the non-copyright stuff there's a lot of really kind of neat things out there that people are doing with their levels I actually kind of like just going in and playing people's first levels and seeing the kind of things that people come up with

215
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:22,363
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

216
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:47,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, people use the arrow stickers to point at things.

217
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:56,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, one friend I've been playing with online a lot recently used the arrow sticker to kind of point me in directions of bubbles I'm missing because in story mode they really hide some of the score bubbles really well.

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,660
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll use the arrow sticker to point so he doesn't have to type to me.

219
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:09,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, like, if you're doing something really well or good, people will use the little heart icon in the pop-it and just hover on it in a minute to show, you know, heart, good thing, heart.

220
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:11,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, you can also hit people.

221
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,365
[SPEAKER_10]: with your character.

222
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:15,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

223
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend has a chicken suit with a frying pan.

224
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,606
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been hitting me over the head with a frying pan.

225
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:23,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a pirate now with a frying pan and a little pirate hook.

226
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:24,848
[SPEAKER_10]: A little tip from me to you.

227
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:28,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Ace the first area, the little England area.

228
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,509
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ace those levels, beat them without dying.

229
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:37,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to do it in one of the levels because it has a collapsing bridge, but if you go back through it with a sticker, you can get past the collapsing bridge with a swing thing.

230
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,911
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get through all those levels without dying, that's how you get the pirate costume.

231
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:42,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty awesome.

232
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:47,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, as you can see, I'm giddy when I talk about this game.

233
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:49,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot of fun and just exploring it.

234
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:52,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so much more potential this game has.

235
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:54,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the game have minor flaws?

236
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:56,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

237
00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:00,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes the camera gets a little wonky, especially if people don't use it right.

238
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,795
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some frame rate issues sometimes.

239
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:06,096
[SPEAKER_10]: When you play online, there's a lot of skipping that goes on.

240
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,496
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

241
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:07,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I look...

242
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,477
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it.

244
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,620
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to love it.

245
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,023
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have a PlayStation 3, is it worth plunking down the money for a system just for LittleBigPlanet?

246
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:46,548
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big investment.

247
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:51,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we have a lot of poor college kids and students that listen to this program.

248
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:52,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not.

249
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,451
[SPEAKER_10]: You really have to weigh the pros and the cons.

250
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,592
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, Christmas is coming around.

251
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,732
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be getting gift certificates.

252
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:01,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It might not be a bad investment, especially if you want a Blu-ray player and all that other fancy stuff.

253
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:11,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you buy, say for example, this weekend they had a deal at Walmart where you purchase a 40 gig system, or I'm sorry, the 80 gig system, and you get a $100 gift card.

254
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:14,955
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

255
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,452
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

256
00:20:48,624 --> 00:21:08,737
[SPEAKER_10]: and between that and then knowing that Home is on the horizon and so on and so on I finally decided to take the plunge and honestly I've been liking the system we did give the system a hell of a time when it first came out but through the magic of patches and all this stuff they've been making the system quite a bit better and now the games are really starting to come out I use it a lot for streaming video files

257
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:10,718
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do to my cat?

258
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,379
[SPEAKER_09]: You will now become a new cat.

259
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:36,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought it was interesting.

260
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:41,508
[SPEAKER_10]: The place, honestly, honestly, you know I still love my Xbox 360, don't get me wrong.

261
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:48,232
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's so odd to me that the freaking Microsoft Vista, what do they call that?

262
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:49,853
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole media sharing media center?

263
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:50,714
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole thing on the 360?

264
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:54,156
[SPEAKER_10]: What a pain in the big fat ass that thing is.

265
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's slow, and it doesn't work.

266
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:57,338
[SPEAKER_10]: If you use that.

267
00:21:57,598 --> 00:21:58,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Never use that, though.

268
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually set it up.

269
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I set it up on Vista to be able to use it on the 360.

270
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,302
[SPEAKER_10]: It is slow as hell.

271
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:04,703
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't work right at all.

272
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:05,604
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3?

273
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I was streaming video off my computer in a minute.

274
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:08,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

275
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:09,506
[SPEAKER_10]: In one minute.

276
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:16,712
[SPEAKER_10]: What you need to do, what I normally use... I just could not believe that Microsoft's own system made it such a pain in the ass.

277
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:18,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping the NXE makes that all go away.

278
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:20,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Media Center is really old, though.

279
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:24,657
[SPEAKER_09]: What you need to use... I use Tversity, which is awesome, and...

280
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:28,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I can stream shit to my 360, my PS3.

281
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I prefer my PS3.

282
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why, but it seems to work really well.

283
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:34,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I see folks in chat saying all these third-party programs as well.

284
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:40,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong, but you would think their own freaking product would interface better with Windows than Sony.

285
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:41,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Five minutes.

286
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:58,738
[SPEAKER_09]: You see, I don't really use the Zoom stuff for their new Windows Media because, you see, my copy of Windows isn't exactly on the up-and-up, so Diversity works really well with those not-so-legitimate copies of Windows.

287
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,039
[SPEAKER_09]: But it works great.

288
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:07,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, mine's the real deal because it came on my computer and everything, and it's still garbage when trying to stream over the network.

289
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:07,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

290
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:09,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Valkyria Chronicles

291
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:33,741
[SPEAKER_10]: from Sega.

292
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:38,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I think it's known as Battlefield Valkyria in Japan.

293
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:42,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like an RTS-type game, but the graphics are kind of neat.

294
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:55,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it's first-person... Like, you go from the top... It zooms in from this top-down view into a first-person view, and then you move your pieces around live and attack things...

295
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,779
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually kind of neat.

296
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,104
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I understand, it's a PS3 exclusive.

297
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:01,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I might pick that one up.

298
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:03,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had quite a good time with that.

299
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:04,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So check out the demo if you haven't.

300
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Valkyria Chronicles.

301
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:10,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on to some housekeeping.

302
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:16,650
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, of course, is not here to tell us about her gaming week, but she'll fill us in a little later when she gets here.

303
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:27,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say something about the podcast delays, because I've been getting some emails about it, and I've seen posts on the forums about it, and yes, the podcast was extremely delayed, especially episode 300.

304
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:28,902
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

305
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:45,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Helpful with that.

306
00:24:46,271 --> 00:24:53,234
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I did finally get an audio editing program on my main machine, so I'm hoping that's going to make the production of the show a hell of a lot faster in the future.

307
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,175
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really sorry about that.

308
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:57,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And as far as episode 300 goes, I know that was a big episode.

309
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:02,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you haven't heard it yet, it's funny because we had so many people here in-house.

310
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So check out episode 300.

311
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:11,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I'm really sorry, but please understand I usually am the one that puts all those shows together just because I just have traditionally.

312
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:12,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And

313
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:14,344
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

314
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:37,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And just with everything else going on in the world, there was just a lot more on my mind than just Orange Lounge Radio.

315
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:47,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, for me, I can't speak for Loki or DarkSakura, but for me personally, being able to take a break from everything and using the surgery as a way to do it was really helpful for me.

316
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,599
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope you all understand.

317
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,681
[SPEAKER_10]: In the real world,

318
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:53,316
[SPEAKER_10]: TV shows.

319
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:55,978
[SPEAKER_10]: They do, what, like 26 episodes a year, if that?

320
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:55,978
23?

321
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,480
[SPEAKER_10]: What's a season order?

322
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, how many episodes of Heroes in a year?

323
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:02,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit, last season we only had, what, 11 episodes all year?

324
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:03,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It's usually 26, I think.

325
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,668
[SPEAKER_10]: So, please bear with us.

326
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:06,849
[SPEAKER_10]: We do our best.

327
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not an anti-podcast thing.

328
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:14,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you want to look at, like, some show, like, say, for example, Little Britain, that's six a season.

329
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:15,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so...

330
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:16,498
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

331
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:21,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, and I know, you know, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad, like, oh, look at me, cry for me.

332
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:21,862
[SPEAKER_10]: We're on season 50.

333
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:29,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to say, guys, please understand, sometimes it goes much more than just the podcast.

334
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:36,513
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're here, we're back, episode 301, and hopefully back on a more regular schedule of Monday, Tuesday-ish show releases.

335
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:44,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably this week's episode, not till Tuesday, to give a little time for episode 300 to get caught by everybody, because, again, it's crazy.

336
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,080
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

337
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,710
[SPEAKER_09]: It went over well.

338
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,572
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Halloween party, I won second place.

339
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,394
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you lose to?

340
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:09,074
[SPEAKER_10]: My sister.

341
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,856
[SPEAKER_10]: She won with Gurr.

342
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, was she like a full-blown Gurr?

343
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:15,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

344
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's pretty awesome.

345
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,142
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're going to lose to anything, lose to Gurr.

346
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:20,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good, you know.

347
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:22,805
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just for fun.

348
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:27,829
[SPEAKER_10]: You have like this family to be reckoned with in Halloween costume contests.

349
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:29,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I normally don't make costumes.

350
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is like the first costume I've...

351
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:34,266
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

352
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,550
[SPEAKER_09]: MakeASackBoy.com What a great plug for the show.

353
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:23,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Loki.

354
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

355
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:27,132
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

356
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:28,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

357
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:30,234
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's start things off.

358
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about a program called Boku.

359
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:38,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And Boku is supposedly Microsoft's answer to LittleBigPlanet.

360
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a programming language meant... Well, it looks like it's meant for little kids.

361
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:48,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, you can use this to create your own games and...

362
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,993
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of like X and A to a certain extent.

363
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,479
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've talked about this before.

364
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Many episodes ago, actually on episode 282, back in June, we had mentioned this one that I actually got a... Damn!

365
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode number and everything.

366
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, Loki.

367
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:08,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

368
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:13,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, there was a survey that was sent out at the time.

369
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:20,234
[SPEAKER_09]: They were talking about some of the in-game objects and characters and whether I liked them or not, so I hated them all.

370
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:21,694
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're alright.

371
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:41,038
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, the programming language itself, it's very, um, looks very basic, but, you know, much like LittleBigPlanet, you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with it, and they showed some examples of different games, and, um, you know, there's basic AI that you can assign to, you know, objects and tell them how to behave and that kind of thing.

372
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:46,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And the games itself, um, look like they're, the levels almost look like they're made out of Legos, which is kind of cool.

373
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

374
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:52,302
[SPEAKER_09]: No word on when exactly this is going to be available.

375
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:54,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this thing's been going on for a long time.

376
00:29:54,782 --> 00:30:00,183
[SPEAKER_09]: They originally announced the project, I'd say, in 2007.

377
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:06,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it's been officially unveiled this week, although it's been at a few different conventions.

378
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:11,065
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just been so much... Didn't they have, like, a tiny, tiny little booth at Penny Arcade Expo, if I remember right?

379
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,326
[SPEAKER_10]: There was something about it.

380
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:14,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it was almost like an informational thing only, if I remember right.

381
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,007
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, the thing at... I thought I saw it somewhere.

382
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:17,847
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the thing at...

383
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:19,847
[SPEAKER_09]: PENI Arcade

384
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:45,854
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:07,668
[SPEAKER_09]: This is supposed to be available, I guess it looks like now.

386
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,210
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying early next year.

387
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:10,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

388
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:11,514
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a video.

389
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:13,116
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can check it out, it's on Gamasutra.

390
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:14,918
[SPEAKER_09]: They have it mirrored on Joystick.

391
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely check it out.

392
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:18,022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool looking.

393
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:21,387
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see what you can do with it.

394
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:31,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what's funny is the entire time that I was playing LittleBigPlanet, I was thinking, how long is it going to be before Microsoft tries to one-up this?

395
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:36,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, because you know Microsoft can't watch these things go by, you know what I mean?

396
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:39,524
[SPEAKER_10]: They always are trying to one-up, especially Sony.

397
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:42,206
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just funny that this is coming to light.

398
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:44,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, don't forget about us, we got a game coming.

399
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:48,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I mean, and this has been around for a while now.

400
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,793
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been in development for at least a few years, so...

401
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:58,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, they definitely won't be the last people to do that, you know

402
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:00,640
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

403
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:29,165
[SPEAKER_10]: SonicM88 in chat, chat.artistonsradio.com says, I don't have time to care about Boku with all the great games out already.

404
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I just keep getting a larger pile of games to play.

405
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:32,791
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of how I'm starting to feel, man.

406
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,534
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many games out there to catch up on.

407
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,136
[SPEAKER_10]: It's insanity.

408
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,500
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, this is the holidays every year.

409
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,760
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like,

410
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and also you have to remember, I mean, you don't have to buy everything day one.

411
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:48,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's like, especially during the holiday, it feels like that you're pressured to be buying a bunch of stuff.

412
00:32:49,028 --> 00:32:53,552
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like Fallout 3, I felt like, oh, I got to get this game, you know, because everyone's hyping it up and stuff.

413
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:55,453
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm like, I got too much shit I got to play.

414
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go buy another game.

415
00:32:56,835 --> 00:33:02,479
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I feel, because I've heard like Fallout 3 is oblivion with guns and nothing could like sell a game better for me.

416
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just, I don't have fucking time.

417
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:06,063
[SPEAKER_10]: between all the other games I'm trying to play.

418
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And then add on top of that, Wrath of the Lich King coming out this week.

419
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know I'm the resident WoW addict.

420
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:11,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Addict.

421
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it sounds like DarkSakura is here with us.

422
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:15,595
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing, Jamie?

423
00:33:15,755 --> 00:33:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for the right moment to pipe in.

424
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:17,818
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

425
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,360
[SPEAKER_10]: You sound a little raspy.

426
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been yelling a lot today?

427
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:22,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm yelling for quite a bit this afternoon.

428
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,097
[SPEAKER_09]: because I'm hungry.

429
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:49,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the story goes is that I went over to Togo's, which is a sandwich chain over here.

430
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:51,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if it's nationwide, but at least on the West Coast.

431
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the same people that own Baskin-Robbins, so I would think so.

432
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:56,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

433
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dunkin' Donuts even, I think.

434
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never seen Togo's outside of Sacramento, though.

435
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:00,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

436
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:06,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Toko's was originally founded in California, so I'm not sure if it's outside that far.

437
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:10,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so they have a large sandwich, which is 8 inches.

438
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:16,090
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other day, or actually yesterday, we went in there to get sandwiches, and we're going to go watch a movie.

439
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And this woman next to me, she's ordering a family-sized sandwich.

440
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:23,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, family-sized sandwich?

441
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:25,733
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, yeah, it's like 24 inches long.

442
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, really, you say?

443
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:30,055
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a size that I was unaware of.

444
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:33,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, because I always thought it'd be funny to order a giant sandwich.

445
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,098
[SPEAKER_12]: 24 inches for you, not them.

446
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:43,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And so basically what I'm going to do with this is, it's not, I'm done with the sandwich for today, but I'm going to eat it like throughout the week.

447
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:46,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's lunch for all week.

448
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:48,047
[SPEAKER_12]: How much did it run you, if you don't mind me asking?

449
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:48,188
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 bucks.

450
00:34:50,228 --> 00:34:55,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if that's a week worth of food, a week worth of lunches, for $20?

451
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,051
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

452
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:56,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That isn't bad.

453
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:57,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad at all.

454
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had known of such a thing while I was in college.

455
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:05,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $21 with a large drink, so you figure the drink's about $2, and then, so it's like $19.

456
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:10,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Subway just, drinks are ridiculous anyway, because you know how much soda actually costs?

457
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:11,319
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

458
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:34,552
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you can go in there.

459
00:35:34,652 --> 00:35:37,693
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I don't think Togo's makes anything larger than two feet.

460
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:40,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe how long we've been talking about a fucking sandwich.

461
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:43,856
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, you have to order it in advance if you're ordering anything bigger.

462
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:47,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I always wanted for my birthday just to order a three foot long sandwich to come in the work with that.

463
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:48,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it would be funny.

464
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people are like, what the hell are you doing?

465
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,501
[SPEAKER_12]: They've done that for work events where I worked before.

466
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:58,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually save these things until the end of the show, but it works too much now.

467
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:05,806
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, at the end of the show, I always love to whore ourselves out for more positive iTunes reviews because it makes us feel really good about what we're doing.

468
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:09,407
[SPEAKER_10]: It helps us spread the word out about our show and increases our rankings in iTunes.

469
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:10,247
[SPEAKER_10]: We do.

470
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:11,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We need our EP stroked once in a while.

471
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:19,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And a couple of you have stroked it in the past couple weeks, including this review from BioHaze20, who says, one of the best podcasts out there.

472
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:20,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, this is related.

473
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:26,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio, keeping you informed about video games, the lifestyle, and most importantly, food.

474
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,731
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fantastic.

475
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:34,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And then goes on to say some very nice things about the show and about AllGames.com, our network that we broadcast on.

476
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:39,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio, thank you for letting Jamie not have to be on the camera.

477
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:40,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Signed, Jamie.

478
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:48,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just hoping they'd have some really cool long box that you could put it in or something because they just gave me the sandwich and expected me to take it home and...

479
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:49,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

480
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:52,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't have them cut it either because I figured that was... All right!

481
00:36:52,974 --> 00:36:54,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough sandwich!

482
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:55,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus!

483
00:36:55,316 --> 00:36:59,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I will inform you right now, I did not have a sandwich for my extended dinner.

484
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,120
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

485
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,583
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week, of all things?

486
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Fable too.

487
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And what'd you think?

488
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:09,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I smashed beetles and I tried to be a good little girl.

489
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:13,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan had an interesting experience.

490
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:16,724
[SPEAKER_04]: His big beefy man got turned into a big beefy woman.

491
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:26,327
[SPEAKER_04]: He drank the gender potion and so he decided just to be evil and went around killing everybody and his dog turned black and he lost his halo and grew horns.

492
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:27,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

493
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:28,126
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

494
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't played Fable 2.

495
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:30,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm having to live.

496
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:32,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another one of those games on the back burner.

497
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:42,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one of our listeners who is in the UK, I really don't know what name he goes by for purposes of chat, so I'm just going to say Rob.

498
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:44,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a good name.

499
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a very good name.

500
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:49,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a present in the form of a Doctor Who game.

501
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:49,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

502
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:51,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

503
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to be reciprocating eventually with Silent Hill Homecoming, but...

504
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:58,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks, are you sad about David Tennant?

505
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:03,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't live in this reality where David Tennant is not going to be the Doctor.

506
00:38:04,226 --> 00:38:04,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

507
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:05,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

508
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I disavow all knowledge of that edition of reality and have instead moved to an alternate reality where David Tennant is the Doctor forever!

509
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:16,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

510
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, and in your DS game, he will be.

511
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:19,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

512
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:19,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

513
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:20,733
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to never watch the show again.

514
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:21,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's got Martha in it.

515
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:23,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Martha's not fun.

516
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:25,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Donna.

517
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:27,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Donna.

518
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:28,217
[SPEAKER_10]: What else was I going to ask you?

519
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:28,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you.

520
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:29,637
[SPEAKER_10]: You.

521
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:30,517
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

522
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:32,578
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to play LittleBigPlanet.

523
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna.

524
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It is fucking amazing.

525
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,499
[SPEAKER_04]: We're supposed to get a free copy.

526
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:46,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And every time I hear the British narrator saying something really fucking cute in, you know, the traditional English style, making those little puns, I think of you.

527
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know you live for that stuff.

528
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:49,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to move there.

529
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,404
[SPEAKER_10]: The narrator is some famous guy, too.

530
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:54,285
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the guy that narrates... He did Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

531
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:55,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's... Oh, sweet.

532
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Season 2 of Supernatural Season 3 of Supernatural

533
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:24,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

534
00:39:24,828 --> 00:39:26,689
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on the tip of my tongue.

535
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to have to look it up because I'm lazy.

536
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to be watching more Supernatural.

537
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:34,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I vow by the end of the semester I will be caught up to date with Supernatural.

538
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that is now my favorite TV show.

539
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:38,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that on the CW?

540
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:39,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

541
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,518
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else they show on the CW?

542
00:39:41,998 --> 00:39:42,699
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

543
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:42,699
90210.

544
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:43,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

545
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't exist in my alternate reality, Rob.

546
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,882
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut your mouth.

547
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:52,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, post-episode 300, we now live in Jamie's alternate reality.

548
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:54,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

549
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:54,870
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

550
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:55,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

551
00:39:56,272 --> 00:40:01,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Masters of the Wiki, can we get a list of things that exist in Jamie's alternate reality?

552
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:05,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I ate at a very good restaurant, speaking of food.

553
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:06,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Not today.

554
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:08,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I ever going to get to talk about Xbox Live?

555
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:09,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to talk about it, Rob.

556
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:10,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to talk about it, Rob.

557
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:10,645
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

558
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:13,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called something Bohem.

559
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Lost something Bohem.

560
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:15,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Lovey Bohem?

561
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:16,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the Rent song?

562
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:19,507
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's kind of... Okay, it's an Italian song.

563
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:20,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Italian song.

564
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:22,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Italian Czech restaurant.

565
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:23,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

566
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:30,909
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very delicious, except the one thing I did not ever expect to hear played in an Italian Czech restaurant was the theme from Shaft.

567
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:37,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting there eating my gnocchi and I'm like, mmm, this is creamy gnocchi.

568
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:38,485
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

569
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:40,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth.

570
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:42,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Just talk about Shaft.

571
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:43,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth and chew.

572
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to share that antidote.

573
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:51,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So in your alternate universe, are all Italian Czech restaurants required to play the theme from Shaft?

574
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:52,789
[SPEAKER_04]: At least once per meal.

575
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:58,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, back to gaming news.

576
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:00,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what to say.

577
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:02,175
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, if you like to blow things up.

578
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:03,516
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be us!

579
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:05,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Who doesn't like to blow things up?

580
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:08,678
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do that on Xbox Live this week with a little game called Vigilante 8.

581
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:11,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura is a bit of a vigilante herself.

582
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,803
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually, speaking of Chef, this game kind of has a bit of a 70s kind of retro feel to it.

583
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:23,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe this is the perfect game to compliment your Italian Czech dining experience.

584
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:24,365
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of the sequel.

585
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:24,805
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

586
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good food, okay?

587
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:27,766
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of the sequel to Interstate 76.

588
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:30,007
[SPEAKER_04]: They had really, really good beer on tap.

589
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:30,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

590
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:33,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's awesome, and it was originally on the PlayStation.

591
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:35,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it have good beer?

592
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:37,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, this is an old game that's being remade.

593
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:39,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Vigilante 8 was out a while ago.

594
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it an arcade game years ago?

595
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,231
[SPEAKER_10]: No, original PlayStation.

596
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,291
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, there you go.

597
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,912
[SPEAKER_10]: But now you can play it online with eight people.

598
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:45,712
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it's Vigilante 8.

599
00:41:45,752 --> 00:41:48,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I downloaded the demo, but I plan on buying it.

600
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,733
[SPEAKER_10]: 800 Microsoft points for the game.

601
00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:50,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have good beer?

602
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:52,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

603
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:56,546
[SPEAKER_09]: You can drive a bus, a school bus with barbed wire and crap on it.

604
00:41:56,926 --> 00:41:57,266
[SPEAKER_09]: School bus.

605
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:58,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that last week's release?

606
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:00,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this week.

607
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:02,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You could also drive a bus in Twisted Metal.

608
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we were off for a week.

609
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:07,088
[SPEAKER_10]: What's coming out this week, on this Wednesday?

610
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:08,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's coming out next week.

611
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about this week.

612
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:14,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It's next week's, well, I'm not going to mention it because I think it's another story.

613
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:19,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But this week, I don't know what's coming out this week.

614
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:24,759
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm sure we'll learn stuff alright well let's move on

615
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:37,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so one thing that... Well, it's already out right now, but Call of Duty World at War, they have an open beta that's available on Xbox Live.

616
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:44,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I imagine this is probably going to be ending pretty soon, since the game comes out, what, in a couple days anyways?

617
00:42:44,802 --> 00:42:48,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, but at least it's kind of cool.

618
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:53,626
[SPEAKER_09]: What was available originally to a few select people is now available to everybody, and...

619
00:42:55,507 --> 00:43:02,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it weighs in at just under 890 megs and is all sorts of fun.

620
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:08,080
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the full game, you'll have to play it and I think it comes out on the 12th.

621
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:09,362
[SPEAKER_04]: How much does 890 megs actually weigh?

622
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:09,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha!

623
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:13,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

624
00:43:13,185 --> 00:43:14,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Those 20 gig hard drives are fairly light.

625
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:17,666
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not light if one falls on your head.

626
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:26,548
[SPEAKER_10]: My first hard drive, my first computer, my first hard drive, my first computer, PC, you know, back when they were calling computers PS2 compatible computers.

627
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:28,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my first hard drive.

628
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:28,109
486.

629
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:30,169
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a three.

630
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:30,809
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I remember.

631
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:30,809
286.

632
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:32,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember clearly a 386SX16.

633
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:37,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's cool to say a lot of numbers in random letters.

634
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:38,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

635
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:39,596
[SPEAKER_10]: SX for sex.

636
00:43:39,636 --> 00:43:41,139
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I could think about when I was in seventh grade.

637
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:41,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it scuzzy?

638
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:43,162
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

639
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:45,746
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a 40 megabyte hard drive in that thing.

640
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Rob!

641
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:16,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and who had the accelerators to go with their processors?

642
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:30,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously now, and that thing was a brick, because we took it out to upgrade it to a 500 megabyte drive years later, and now I can carry, even that 500 megabyte drive was a brick too, now I carry around a gigabyte in my pocket.

643
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:32,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

644
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:33,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Memory is so damn cheap.

645
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:37,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two gigs in my pocket right now, and it's happy to see you.

646
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,127
[SPEAKER_10]: You're quite feisty today.

647
00:44:40,187 --> 00:44:41,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd rather like it.

648
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:43,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie had some really delicious wine at dinner.

649
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:46,130
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to get loaded more often.

650
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not loaded!

651
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:48,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, otherwise you wouldn't have driven here.

652
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:49,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

653
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:50,852
[SPEAKER_10]: But you need to loosen up a little bit.

654
00:44:50,932 --> 00:44:53,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just had a busy day and I'm coming off of the adrenaline.

655
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:54,754
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool, that's cool.

656
00:44:55,234 --> 00:45:04,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well hey, if you like old things to be all new again, since we're talking a little bit retro, I bet you guys are really excited to hear that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is apparently all done, ready to go.

657
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:06,559
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been submitted to Microsoft for certification.

658
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:14,823
[SPEAKER_10]: They are saying the game will come out in November, and hmm, I'm thinking, what a nice Thanksgiving treat this might be for Microsoft fans everywhere, don't you think?

659
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:16,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

660
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:18,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this also coming out on PlayStation Network as well?

661
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:19,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

662
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:21,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's got to get by both of those hurdles before the game will come out.

663
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:28,160
[SPEAKER_10]: But even for Sony fans, it's a nice way to sit on the couch and relax after eating all that turkey.

664
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,340
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

665
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:35,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are targeting November, but just because they target it, folks, though, remember that doesn't always mean they're going to make it.

666
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:36,234
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know.

667
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:40,617
[SPEAKER_10]: If the damn thing failed certification for whatever reason, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board.

668
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:41,557
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have submitted it.

669
00:45:42,037 --> 00:45:43,378
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very soon to go.

670
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:44,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

671
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:50,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't wait that long, well, this Wednesday you can download a brand new level for Pinball FX.

672
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:57,527
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Street Fighter-themed level, and it will, of course, cost you 200 Microsoft points.

673
00:45:58,407 --> 00:45:58,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

674
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks pretty cool.

675
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,071
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not bad, though.

676
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: 200 Microsoft points is what?

677
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:02,912
250?

678
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:05,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Jamie, you would probably know this.

679
00:46:05,853 --> 00:46:08,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Any Street Fighter themed actual pinball tables.

680
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:10,324
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one.

681
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,025
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, oh God, and I've played one before.

682
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:14,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't very good.

683
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:15,646
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too bad.

684
00:46:15,926 --> 00:46:16,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to recall that too.

685
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:20,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember playing it and it wasn't that good.

686
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:22,208
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm right, I know it wasn't a wide body.

687
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:25,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just a standard pinball that some ran.

688
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to find out actually.

689
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get the company because I want to say it was a Data East, but don't quote me yet.

690
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:30,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Gatleib

691
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,723
[SPEAKER_10]: and so was the Mario game, I believe was a Gottlieb game.

692
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:54,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a lot of fun, speaking of pinball.

693
00:46:54,665 --> 00:46:57,666
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mario, there was a Super Mario World one, actually.

694
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:58,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the one I'm thinking of.

695
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:00,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's it.

696
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:01,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it was like a Mario Bros.

697
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:06,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that was in, no, and that would suck too if it wasn't in there, but remember how they had the Gottlieb collection for Wii?

698
00:47:07,112 --> 00:47:11,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be cool if the Super Mario table was in there since it came out on the Wii, but...

699
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:14,823
[SPEAKER_09]: The collection I have on the Wii is Williams, not Gottlieb.

700
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Gottlieb was in the UK.

701
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:20,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Street Fighter 2 pinball that was developed by Gottlieb in 1993.

702
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:25,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember it being very good, but I know some people like it.

703
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:33,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinball is kind of one of those things where I notice... Pinball is pinball.

704
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:40,928
[SPEAKER_10]: There are really good tables and really bad tables, but generally, the tables that people do really well on, they tend to like more, I notice.

705
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, we picked up a new pinball table, did I tell you?

706
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:44,721
[SPEAKER_10]: No, what'd you get?

707
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:47,741
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Revenge from Mars.

708
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: No, take that back.

709
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:49,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

710
00:47:49,842 --> 00:47:50,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.

711
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:50,862
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an Episode 1.

712
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:53,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's cool.

713
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:54,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we picked it up.

714
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,203
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a hologram one.

715
00:47:55,243 --> 00:47:56,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are rad.

716
00:47:56,103 --> 00:47:57,744
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they call it, the Pin 2000 or whatever?

717
00:47:57,784 --> 00:47:58,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball 2000, exactly.

718
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:01,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on restoring it right now, but it plays really well.

719
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:02,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

720
00:48:02,185 --> 00:48:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought I'd mention because I'd forgotten about it.

721
00:48:04,165 --> 00:48:07,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, listeners, are there some good pinball podcasts out there?

722
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:08,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

723
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:09,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

724
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:36,104
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, moving on to other news.

725
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:45,646
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the new Exit Box Experience is coming out pretty soon, and I know some of our listeners have been lucky enough to get into the whole beta test, which, by the way, I'm kind of pissed about missing the whole beta test thing.

726
00:48:45,946 --> 00:48:49,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even sign up because it was like the day before my surgery or something.

727
00:48:49,948 --> 00:48:52,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was such a small window.

728
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:57,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just wasn't able to get in on it, which sucks because I could have really used the streaming Netflix part.

729
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Right about now, but that's alright.

730
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:01,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to make do with regular Netflix.

731
00:49:03,113 --> 00:49:09,436
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently, a lot of the features that were originally supposed to be in the new Xbox experience were cut.

732
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:18,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not talking about things that they've already shown that have been cut, such as the whole game show thing that they first showed.

733
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:18,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not talking about that.

734
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about they had this big list of things they wanted to accomplish...

735
00:49:23,058 --> 00:49:33,804
[SPEAKER_10]: and according to the head of Xbox Live in Europe, Jerry Johnson, he actually said of this list, they cut out half of it and only put in half of it into the new Xbox experience.

736
00:49:34,065 --> 00:49:36,726
[SPEAKER_10]: But assumably, that other half will continue to kind of grow.

737
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:40,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing they talked about, there's actually a quote here from Johnson.

738
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,150
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, quote, still a lot of stuff we want to do.

739
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Half of the things we wanted to do, we cut out of the service.

740
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:49,674
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these things was a photo party app that will be part of the platform.

741
00:49:50,434 --> 00:49:58,916
[SPEAKER_10]: The way it will be distributed is all of a sudden you'll see a slot on the dashboard, and if you don't have it, you click on it, and it's going to download from the service onto your application part of the dashboard.

742
00:49:59,176 --> 00:50:00,836
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the type of things we're going to start doing.

743
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:02,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So a photo party.

744
00:50:02,896 --> 00:50:03,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's fine.

745
00:50:03,676 --> 00:50:14,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't say that there's... It's not like there's... Aren't they worried, though, about the photo party being all porno pictures and bukkake photo Asian girl XXX parties?

746
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:17,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what other kind of photo parties would you possibly have?

747
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:19,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

748
00:50:19,919 --> 00:50:20,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

749
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe showing pictures of the kids to relatives or cousins who also happen to be on Xbox Live.

750
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,040
[SPEAKER_09]: That's lame.

751
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,820
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what email's for.

752
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is up with your LiveJournal icon?

753
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:29,521
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up with my LiveJournal icon?

754
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:30,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like pasta.

755
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:31,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't... Oh.

756
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shrimp chow mein.

757
00:50:33,142 --> 00:50:33,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask me later.

758
00:50:33,842 --> 00:50:34,982
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to do a show here.

759
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:37,242
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

00:58:16,825 --> 00:58:17,185

00:58:17,345 --> 00:58:17,685
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

836
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:18,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

837
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:24,028
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and this is the part of the show where usually the chatroom listeners start to parody the different releases that are coming out.

838
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:32,032
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says SingStarLoki Redertainment says My Horse and Me 2 Adventures in Tiawata Now that would be a game worth playing.

839
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:35,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That one should actually be called Me and the Horse I Rode In On.

840
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:49,650
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says no SingStar matters unless it's Abba SingStar you damn right Redertainment says my secret diary finally a place to go on and on about the things that people could honestly give a rat's ass about don't we have that?

841
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,511
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it called LiveJournal?

842
00:58:52,662 --> 00:59:03,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, is Top Model smarter than a 5th grader?

843
00:59:03,785 --> 00:59:08,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Which reminded me, one game I did play this week, I actually played the demo of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?

844
00:59:09,826 --> 00:59:12,227
[SPEAKER_10]: You might be surprised at my thoughts on this game.

845
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:13,287
[SPEAKER_10]: For what it is...

846
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:21,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not bad, the game itself, but I think the thrill of are you smarter than a fifth grader could only really last so long.

847
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of one of those ha-ha for about 15 minutes.

848
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that they changed the name to 10-year-old for the UK because there's not a fifth grade.

849
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, there you go.

850
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:31,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah.

851
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,611
[SPEAKER_10]: They released the US version here on Xbox Live.

852
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:40,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Or they could just forego releasing it in the UK because it sucks and why are we torturing them anyway?

853
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:45,098
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm trying to say, for what it is, it actually doesn't suck.

854
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:50,582
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fact is, it is a game based off a TV show that

855
00:59:51,994 --> 00:59:55,377
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have just called it, Are You Smarter Than An American?

856
00:59:55,557 --> 01:00:03,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would have probably sold like hotcakes because everyone's like, Oh my god, I am so much smarter than that stupid America.

857
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:04,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

858
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:06,126
[SPEAKER_04]: What, as a collective?

859
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,568
[SPEAKER_10]: As a collective.

860
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:09,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Even, forget it.

861
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:10,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, um...

862
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:12,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I'm thinking yes

863
01:00:33,466 --> 01:00:37,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you get FIFA Soccer 09 as well.

864
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:40,750
[SPEAKER_10]: A Mahjong game gets a price reduction in Koei's best series.

865
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Major League Beast... Beastball?

866
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:43,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Baseball!

867
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Beastball!

868
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:46,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Beastball!

869
01:00:46,553 --> 01:00:47,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see that.

870
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:49,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Major League Beastball!

871
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,796
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Major League Baseball 2008 comes out in Japan.

872
01:00:52,077 --> 01:00:54,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know baseball is huge in Japan.

873
01:00:55,824 --> 01:01:00,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Derby Time Online comes out on PlayStation 3, so if you like your horsey racing, there you go.

874
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:05,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week, quite a bit of stuff.

875
01:01:06,493 --> 01:01:13,839
[SPEAKER_10]: New Ono Kids Wii, Jinsei Game Wii, FIFA Soccer 09 All Play, because you know EA likes to do the All Play thing.

876
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Family Ski, World Ski and Snowboard, if I'm not mistaken, that's the Wii Mat game.

877
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:19,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Fit!

878
01:01:23,669 --> 01:01:24,570
[SPEAKER_10]: that uses that, right?

879
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,252
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Family Athletics would be that one.

880
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Family Ski was Wii Ski.

881
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:31,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

882
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:34,075
[SPEAKER_09]: But it sounds like that's... Is that price reduction?

883
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:38,057
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's coming out from Namco, and it's not a price reduction.

884
01:01:38,618 --> 01:01:40,339
[SPEAKER_10]: That already came out over there, unless it's a sequel.

885
01:01:40,399 --> 01:01:41,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's a sequel.

886
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:42,840
[SPEAKER_10]: It could, because this has snowboarding in it, too.

887
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I see.

888
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:43,581
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

889
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:50,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a game coming out from THQ on the Wii called Blob Colorful Nakibu, which I'm guessing is their localized version of...

890
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:51,705
[SPEAKER_10]: The Blob

891
01:02:19,095 --> 01:02:21,236
[SPEAKER_10]: and Grow Your Rice and Make Your Citizens Happy.

892
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:34,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, coming out on the portable systems, if you are so inclined to check out on the Nintendo DS, you can check out... Sorry, I'm losing my release dates here.

893
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:37,566
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Nintendo DS, some new casings and so on.

894
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:40,647
[SPEAKER_10]: A game called Juggler, a Nobunaga game.

895
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:41,728
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a price reduction there, too.

896
01:02:42,148 --> 01:02:42,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm to Cooking.

897
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:51,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Ryusei no Rockman 3, Black Ace and Red Joker, Tyson, Kato-chan no Koronope, Zerokara Hajimiru, Otona no 5,

898
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:04,205
[SPEAKER_10]: and Kokugo Numion.

899
01:03:04,966 --> 01:03:06,268
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

900
01:03:06,468 --> 01:03:09,953
[SPEAKER_10]: All this stuff just kind of sucks when you consider the next week is Chrono Trigger.

901
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:12,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot Pokemon Ranger was coming out this week.

902
01:03:12,937 --> 01:03:15,040
[SPEAKER_09]: The Shadows of Almia on DS.

903
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:16,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

904
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:16,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

905
01:03:16,823 --> 01:03:18,325
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes this Pokemon game special?

906
01:03:18,645 --> 01:03:18,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

907
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:27,393
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Sony PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment gets a price reduction and FIFA Soccer 09 also gets a version there on the PSP.

908
01:03:28,234 --> 01:03:43,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, as far as new stuff goes, not a whole lot, but you do have a game called Sengoku, Efuda, Yugi, Hoto, Gisu, Ran, and Zero Pilot, Daisanji, Sekai Taisen 1946 are your two new PSP games this week.

909
01:03:45,149 --> 01:04:14,365
[SPEAKER_10]: also this one I'm sorry I missed this one this is a pretty big one I think over in Japan it's bolded on my list which usually means it's a pretty big deal it's a game called Chuman Shiozi Oretachi no Sekai and I'm trying to figure out what it's a version of I don't know it might be something unique over there based off one of their TV shows or something but it looks like it is a action game coming out over there there you go that's it for Japanese release dates

910
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:15,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, cool.

911
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:17,292
[SPEAKER_12]: What about Zimbabwe?

912
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:18,894
[SPEAKER_10]: What about it?

913
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:20,497
[SPEAKER_12]: What about their release dates?

914
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:24,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you might have to listen to another podcast because it's only a three hour show.

915
01:04:24,082 --> 01:04:25,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, we can't do every country in the world.

916
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:31,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Australia, cry, cry, we don't do your dates or some of the other places that listen to us, but we only have so many hours.

917
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:43,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, as I said earlier, if you're confused on what you should make in LittleBigPlanet, well, there's something that might be able to help you out.

918
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:47,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, LittleBigWorkshop is a website that's been released.

919
01:04:48,158 --> 01:04:51,759
[SPEAKER_09]: They have tools that will allow you to design your

920
01:04:52,779 --> 01:05:10,967
[SPEAKER_09]: your levels basically and can help you plan out things and that kind of stuff so go to www.littlebigworkshop.com and check it out and you might be able to create the next big level hopefully not based off of licensed materials otherwise I'll get yanked offline

921
01:05:11,147 --> 01:05:16,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say I did visit that website and you can link it to your own PlayStation Network account, which is pretty cool.

922
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,984
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to use your email address though instead of your sign-in name, which I thought was weird.

923
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:23,570
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you sign in with your email address and password, you can actually kind of...

924
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:25,567
[SPEAKER_10]: have your own little page on there.

925
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:28,548
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't quite interact with it as much as you'd like.

926
01:05:28,728 --> 01:05:32,489
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to see your creations pop up on there, but it's kind of interesting.

927
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:43,151
[SPEAKER_10]: It tries to do the whole social network thing where you have your own Facebooky update your current status thing, but I don't think it's really something I would practically use.

928
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:48,093
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's neat that it's there, and there's the potential that they might expand that, if you know what I mean.

929
01:05:49,373 --> 01:05:50,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So, pretty cool.

930
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:54,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and then the copyright levels, right?

931
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:55,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but that's the thing.

932
01:05:56,838 --> 01:06:04,221
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of copyrighted levels or levels with copyrighted materials in them that are being yanked offline.

933
01:06:04,621 --> 01:06:09,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Included in that, of course, like levels based off Pac-Man, Batman.

934
01:06:09,683 --> 01:06:13,065
[SPEAKER_09]: There was even like a Scrubs level, I guess, that was taken offline.

935
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:16,186
[SPEAKER_09]: One weird one, though, was there was a level called Phantasm.

936
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:17,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

937
01:06:38,572 --> 01:06:40,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Good comment from GS68 in chat.

938
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:41,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Blastworks.

939
01:06:41,355 --> 01:06:44,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the Wii game Blastworks that a lot of us unfortunately overlooked?

940
01:06:44,518 --> 01:06:45,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not here on OLR.

941
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:46,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's been hyping this game up forever.

942
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and unfortunately I never really played it much.

943
01:06:48,962 --> 01:06:49,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

944
01:06:49,783 --> 01:06:54,268
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, Blastworks has copyrighted user-created stuff and nobody gives a shit.

945
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:56,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's so far under the radar.

946
01:06:57,147 --> 01:07:00,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sometimes having your game under the radar isn't necessarily a bad thing, I suppose.

947
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,933
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is so weird, though, Loki, how much copyrighted stuff still gets through.

948
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:06,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that Gradius level is still there.

949
01:07:07,514 --> 01:07:09,296
[SPEAKER_10]: It was there just before we went live tonight.

950
01:07:09,456 --> 01:07:19,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think it's really awesome, and it's getting people, you know, I think people will throw a fit if I want to just know how the level works and then maybe make something that's original that kind of plays the same, you know what I mean?

951
01:07:19,943 --> 01:07:20,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

952
01:07:20,643 --> 01:07:22,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's very interesting.

953
01:07:22,184 --> 01:07:33,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and I played a Batman level, and I don't remember if I talked about it earlier on this show or at the Tail End of Bobby's show where we're usually on, but there's a Batman level out there too that just, you know, infringes on that IP left and right.

954
01:07:33,548 --> 01:07:41,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously not in the level design, but, you know, it uses the little Batman logo or someone's little creation of it, and that you even unlock that as a reward.

955
01:07:42,012 --> 01:07:44,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's lots of IP infringement going on out there.

956
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:51,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other things that probably make people pissed off too, unpublished levels are actually being moderated.

957
01:07:52,716 --> 01:07:53,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Weird.

958
01:07:53,557 --> 01:07:54,317
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that possible?

959
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but it says, for example...

960
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:07,732
[SPEAKER_09]: One user posted a strategy for keeping a copy of the level offline and republishing it in case it gets deleted.

961
01:08:08,572 --> 01:08:12,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting moderated too.

962
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:15,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never been so infuriated over a game, he says.

963
01:08:16,273 --> 01:08:16,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Weird.

964
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:22,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's one of those things where once a crook, always a crook.

965
01:08:22,454 --> 01:08:24,895
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do it once, they go through and look at your files somehow.

966
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:27,941
[SPEAKER_10]: and see if you're infringing any other places?

967
01:08:28,081 --> 01:08:28,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

968
01:08:28,902 --> 01:08:30,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's weird.

969
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:31,824
[SPEAKER_09]: That is weird.

970
01:08:32,004 --> 01:08:45,036
[SPEAKER_09]: This reader, I guess, on Kotaku, Robbie M or whatever, he said, so many cases have no questionable content in sight, even ones with humorous, lighthearted violence have been taken down, like the popular Gears of War Demon Skull level.

971
01:08:45,336 --> 01:08:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's Gears of War.

972
01:08:47,017 --> 01:08:48,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't get taken down because of the violence.

973
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:56,441
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the point of having a community-driven game if you're not going to let your community do anything with it and act to try to please everybody?

974
01:08:56,521 --> 01:09:02,643
[SPEAKER_10]: The game itself has some pretty controversial, should we say, things in it.

975
01:09:02,783 --> 01:09:05,764
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole level where you're in the strip club, practically.

976
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:10,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we showed it on our little preview show we did a few weeks ago, but I played it in the real game.

977
01:09:10,806 --> 01:09:13,927
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got little things dancing on poles.

978
01:09:14,007 --> 01:09:15,047
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no mistaking what it is.

979
01:09:17,388 --> 01:09:22,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Redertainment in chat says, so I can't keep my penis level safe by keeping it offline.

980
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:25,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I think yes, you can.

981
01:09:25,255 --> 01:09:30,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's when you go online and then you get caught that these people start to have issues.

982
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they can moderate your level.

983
01:09:32,921 --> 01:09:33,682
[SPEAKER_10]: That's stupid.

984
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:35,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

985
01:09:36,564 --> 01:09:39,347
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as these people bitching and stuff, here's the complication.

986
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:43,370
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we all subjected to by accepting the end user license agreement.

987
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:47,632
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to be extra safe, just make backups of your saves.

988
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:49,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's really the only thing you can do.

989
01:09:50,093 --> 01:09:53,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, the PlayStation 3, it's really easy to do that.

990
01:09:53,134 --> 01:10:00,736
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the other thing is you can download saves online with the PS3 because none of those are linked to your user account.

991
01:10:00,817 --> 01:10:03,918
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just go on GameFAQs, for example, and download stuff.

992
01:10:05,138 --> 01:10:06,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could swap levels that way.

993
01:10:06,858 --> 01:10:07,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

994
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:09,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish you could because that would be nice.

995
01:10:10,179 --> 01:10:12,620
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be able to download levels that are awesome to play.

996
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:20,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Really interesting comment from chat from Shaoran saying, but that's not as offensive as two men kissing.

997
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:24,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to that whole... What was that?

998
01:10:24,582 --> 01:10:27,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Whattheyplay.com poll we talked about months ago.

999
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:30,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that whole thing where two men kissing was one of the most offensive things?

1000
01:10:30,884 --> 01:10:31,844
[SPEAKER_10]: But that had me thinking...

1001
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:45,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Boy, if you want to try pushing the envelope in one of your levels, see if something gets taken down for that, and then that would be interesting, to say the least.

1002
01:10:46,624 --> 01:10:47,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, to say the least.

1003
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:50,457
[SPEAKER_10]: and make the level called What They Play.

1004
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:57,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be very curious to see what Sony might have to do when faced with that situation.

1005
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:04,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this has been a topic of controversy lately and I'm sure we'll have to talk about it at some point during tonight's show.

1006
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,809
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is a level in the actual game that goes around a wedding.

1007
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:13,233
[SPEAKER_10]: You go through three levels that all center around a wedding and a crazy bride going after her drunk...

1008
01:11:13,673 --> 01:11:35,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Drunken Groom which by the way is my favorite level in the game so far is the Skulldozer level if you've played that it would be very interesting to see what might happen if somebody publishes a level with two grooms I'd be very curious to see what happens anyhow now I'm getting ideas for my first level there you go Rob Roberts Big Gay Adventure

1009
01:11:40,887 --> 01:11:41,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1010
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, now I'm feeling inspiration here.

1011
01:11:44,829 --> 01:11:45,570
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

1012
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:49,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing more inspiring than offending people.

1013
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:50,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not offensive.

1014
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,614
[SPEAKER_10]: What's offensive about gaiety?

1015
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:53,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

1016
01:11:54,235 --> 01:11:55,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I pushing the envelope?

1017
01:11:55,656 --> 01:11:57,377
[SPEAKER_10]: No, to other people maybe.

1018
01:11:57,857 --> 01:11:58,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1019
01:11:59,158 --> 01:11:59,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it offensive?

1020
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:00,379
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't be.

1021
01:12:01,573 --> 01:12:01,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1022
01:12:02,414 --> 01:12:08,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, let's totally forget that that whole level had so many zombies and voodoo crap in it.

1023
01:12:08,743 --> 01:12:10,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, that's South America for you.

1024
01:12:11,308 --> 01:12:12,909
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, God, man, seriously.

1025
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:15,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've got some ideas brewing.

1026
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,550
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

1027
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:20,011
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on, though, to more stories about LittleBigPlanet.

1028
01:12:20,351 --> 01:12:22,672
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, but the thing is, you have to be careful with it.

1029
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:28,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Because while I can poke fun at myself and all that stuff, there are people out there that would play it and think it's real.

1030
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:33,315
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a very fine line here you'd have to walk to make it.

1031
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:36,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And to anybody who's thinking about stealing my idea, one, I'll cut you.

1032
01:12:37,017 --> 01:12:37,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Two...

1033
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:46,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Be very careful because you can push the envelope, but just be careful because there's some people out there who don't know any better, if you know what I mean.

1034
01:12:46,647 --> 01:12:49,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Rob, how far have you gotten in LittleBigPlant?

1035
01:12:50,628 --> 01:12:56,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've been playing so many custom levels that in story I've only gotten as far as the... I just beat the boss.

1036
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:59,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't want to spoil it, but I just got past Mexico.

1037
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:01,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Just past Mexico.

1038
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:04,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so you haven't gotten to the flamethrowing cat.

1039
01:13:04,392 --> 01:13:04,572
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1040
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:06,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I want a flamethrower and cat.

1041
01:13:07,195 --> 01:13:07,695
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow.

1042
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:17,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of LittleBigPlanet and copyright infringement and all this crazy stuff, Media Molecule on their developer site, they're actually showing screenshots of an image import tool.

1043
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:24,370
[SPEAKER_10]: So pretty soon, you're going to be able to import images from your hard drive on the PlayStation 3 into LittleBigPlanet.

1044
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:25,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Making it even easier to...

1045
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:55,389
[SPEAKER_10]: even easier to infringe on copyrights galore but you could also put in pictures of yourself or if one commercial that they're actually airing over in the UK which I saw on the three speech blog you can actually put pictures of your family in the game you can actually see this in one of the commercials but who do you believe because the developer also has come out this week and said even though it's on their blog a representative for Media Molecule said on the forums image importing is technically viable but there are no plans to introduce it for a variety of reasons

1046
01:13:57,711 --> 01:14:03,516
[SPEAKER_10]: but here's the thing if people want to get their images in the game they're already doing it how?

1047
01:14:03,756 --> 01:14:17,087
[SPEAKER_10]: by printing it out and holding it in front of the camera that's what Bobby did in his level and also in some other levels I've seen out there there's one level I played I unlocked stickers with pictures of Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood things from the 60s and 70s

1048
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:19,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft.com

1049
01:14:40,897 --> 01:14:45,999
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Sony knew the can of worms they were ready to open here, but very interesting to see what happens.

1050
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:51,922
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think, though, what they ought to do, in my opinion, what they ought to do is they ought to set a threshold.

1051
01:14:52,462 --> 01:15:00,945
[SPEAKER_10]: And if so many people report the game, the game should disappear from the globe and probably search results as well.

1052
01:15:00,985 --> 01:15:04,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it goes to, like, the bottom of the list so that people just don't find it.

1053
01:15:04,887 --> 01:15:32,182
[SPEAKER_09]: but I don't know about this whole crazy going on your hard drive and deleting everything and slapping you on the wrist I have a problem with them monitoring stuff that's on your system because that's your stuff if I want to make a Batman level I should be able to make a Batman level for myself or to show it to my friends now I do have a problem I don't have a problem with them taking it offline because if it's obviously violating copyrights or whatever they don't want to get in trouble with anybody else that's fine they should be able to do that

1054
01:15:32,722 --> 01:15:41,465
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, I feel that I should be able to send the level to a friend over their online service.

1055
01:15:41,645 --> 01:15:43,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any harm in that.

1056
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:46,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they'll find a reason not to.

1057
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a way to be able to swap them offline or something like that.

1058
01:15:51,298 --> 01:15:54,039
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can share that, but we don't want to hear about it.

1059
01:15:54,059 --> 01:15:57,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think they're going to have a problem policing it all.

1060
01:15:57,861 --> 01:16:01,042
[SPEAKER_10]: This game has the potential to get so big if it isn't already.

1061
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like building these levels is that easy.

1062
01:16:06,705 --> 01:16:09,126
[SPEAKER_10]: The creator can get pretty involved.

1063
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:17,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to make it sound like you can't do it, but it takes a little time and thinking to build a level.

1064
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:18,410
[SPEAKER_10]: It's as easy as it can get.

1065
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:19,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1066
01:16:38,834 --> 01:16:39,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1067
01:16:39,234 --> 01:16:41,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he used the basic artwork.

1068
01:16:41,495 --> 01:16:46,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he built this own little unique car thing and used the eye toy to get some of the all-game stuff in there, which is pretty awesome.

1069
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:49,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait until you get to some of the later levels there, Rob.

1070
01:16:49,596 --> 01:16:52,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're going to see some pretty cool stuff that they've done with it.

1071
01:16:52,857 --> 01:16:56,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there's one where you have a hot air balloon that you can control.

1072
01:16:56,858 --> 01:16:57,578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, like, nuts.

1073
01:16:57,938 --> 01:16:58,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1074
01:16:58,658 --> 01:16:59,699
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

1075
01:16:59,879 --> 01:17:01,179
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got so much more news to get to.

1076
01:17:01,599 --> 01:17:07,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of innovative things, Sony has actually patented a brand new controller system.

1077
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:14,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically using a hybrid video capture and ultrasonic tracking system.

1078
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:19,170
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're kind of doing is creating these things that look almost like they could be Wii remotes.

1079
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:23,893
[SPEAKER_09]: The way it's done, it's all done with the PlayStation Eye, because the PlayStation Eye has four...

1080
01:17:24,693 --> 01:17:25,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1081
01:17:51,069 --> 01:18:20,577
[SPEAKER_09]: which is kind of neat and that would be the way to do it integrated I guess now with the current technology that they have on the system hmm so maybe sometime soon maybe we'll see a new controller or something do you think this is something for Sony's next system or do you think this is something Sony wants to implement with their current one I think it's their current one because on the actual patent it says PS3 on it and it's showing the Wi-Fi and like the PlayStation Eye camera and stuff like that hmm

1082
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:51,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean it makes sense if they want to expand out because right now I think the only thing they're lacking right now is good family games I mean they do have like LittleBigPlanet but there's nothing that's really like get in and just you know play even the Xbox 360 doesn't have a lot of stuff they have a little bit more than Sony but I mean the Wii's got them beat big time with like casual more family friendly just play type of stuff you know like tennis or something is it the same thing as this that I have on my monitor here right now no okay

1083
01:18:53,476 --> 01:18:53,696
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

1084
01:19:14,187 --> 01:19:16,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic, Ultimate Genesis Collection, 40 Titles,

1085
01:19:38,555 --> 01:19:41,937
[SPEAKER_10]: 40 titles that were on the Genesis for next-gen systems.

1086
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:46,699
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a $30 game coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1087
01:19:47,459 --> 01:20:04,148
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 40 titles, everything from Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle to Vector Man 2 and everything in between, including Golden Axe, all three of them, Phantasy Star 2, 3, and 4, Kid Chameleon, Echo 1, Echo 2, Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Shinobi 3...

1088
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:09,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, Streets of Rage, you know, pretty much all your... I think Spinball was in there too.

1089
01:20:10,652 --> 01:20:11,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Was Sonic Spinball in there?

1090
01:20:11,733 --> 01:20:12,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

1091
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:17,797
[SPEAKER_10]: All your definitive Sega Genesis games are in this collection pretty much, you know, that were first party.

1092
01:20:18,377 --> 01:20:19,998
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be releasing in spring 2009.

1093
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:21,900
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the interesting thing.

1094
01:20:23,261 --> 01:20:25,963
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you might be thinking, well, why am I going to buy this shit all over again?

1095
01:20:26,003 --> 01:20:28,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it seems like they're always releasing Sonic.

1096
01:20:28,564 --> 01:20:30,766
[SPEAKER_10]: They've released it as a download.

1097
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:31,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

1098
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:32,707
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to output in 720p.

1099
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:39,002
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's the big thing that's making people's eyebrows go really?

1100
01:20:40,725 --> 01:20:43,972
[SPEAKER_10]: 720p for my Genesis yeah that doesn't mean they went back and redid all the graphics

1101
01:20:45,543 --> 01:20:47,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kind of an interesting little addition.

1102
01:20:48,284 --> 01:20:50,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like it's a little more than just a Genesis emulator.

1103
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:51,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

1104
01:20:52,006 --> 01:21:02,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think they're going to do it kind of similar to how the Sonic games are where you can set it so that the edges are smoothed out a little bit and it's kind of blurry.

1105
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:09,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can just do it where it scales everything up and it's not necessarily blurry or smooth.

1106
01:21:09,313 --> 01:21:09,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just...

1107
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:11,834
[SPEAKER_09]: and larger pixels, I guess.

1108
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:18,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Now add in the whole achievement and trophy whoring into the mix and I think a lot of folks are going to have fun with this.

1109
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:22,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if they're releasing this for 360, 360 games have to have achievements, right?

1110
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:22,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1111
01:21:23,043 --> 01:21:24,044
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of the mandate.

1112
01:21:24,164 --> 01:21:30,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Now PlayStation 3 games don't have to have trophies, but you assume at this point if they're going to go to trouble to put the achievements in there, they might as well do the trophies.

1113
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:36,914
[SPEAKER_10]: So these games, these 40 games, that's going to be 40 achievements probably for beating all 40 games.

1114
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:38,770
[SPEAKER_10]: 8 dollars, 75 cents.

1115
01:22:04,574 --> 01:22:06,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, I get to pick them at $8 a pop.

1116
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I get 40 of the pretty good ones at 75 cents a pop.

1117
01:22:10,536 --> 01:22:10,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1118
01:22:11,857 --> 01:22:12,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1119
01:22:13,397 --> 01:22:16,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee in chat says, Who in the freaking hell cares about achievements that much?

1120
01:22:17,518 --> 01:22:18,419
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd be surprised.

1121
01:22:19,499 --> 01:22:20,520
[SPEAKER_09]: He would be surprised.

1122
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1123
01:22:23,168 --> 01:22:26,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember they also have the Namco collection that came out last week as well.

1124
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:27,430
[SPEAKER_09]: True statement.

1125
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's supposed to be pretty nice too.

1126
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:32,133
[SPEAKER_09]: They had like 30-some games in there as well.

1127
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So, nice.

1128
01:22:34,114 --> 01:22:39,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, with the brand new DSi system out in Japan, of course, you know,

1129
01:22:40,618 --> 01:22:41,338
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1130
01:23:03,888 --> 01:23:04,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1131
01:23:23,257 --> 01:23:24,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that would be pretty awesome.

1132
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:39,106
[SPEAKER_09]: The DSi is getting a WarioWare Photograph that's a camera-enabled gesture-based game as well as several WarioWare minigames that will be available to download on the system's online store.

1133
01:23:40,647 --> 01:23:46,890
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's very interesting that they're going to go that route and actually offer each game individually.

1134
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1135
01:23:49,331 --> 01:23:49,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1136
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:53,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but I do love me some WarioWare.

1137
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:57,983
[SPEAKER_10]: They're always pretty innovative with what they do with whatever new piece of thing.

1138
01:23:58,304 --> 01:24:00,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, WarioWare myself sounds pretty awesome.

1139
01:24:00,765 --> 01:24:02,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'd be very interesting.

1140
01:24:03,227 --> 01:24:04,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, you know what else sounds awesome?

1141
01:24:05,888 --> 01:24:06,709
[SPEAKER_10]: A remake...

1142
01:24:07,826 --> 01:24:11,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Press Your Luck Old School 80s Press Your Luck No Whammies I remember the guy who memorized the screens

1143
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:28,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they did a whole little thing on Game Show Network about him.

1144
01:24:28,273 --> 01:24:29,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And sadly, I missed it, which kind of sucks.

1145
01:24:30,075 --> 01:24:32,197
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have this whole thing.

1146
01:24:32,638 --> 01:24:39,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, they are actually going to be making new computer games for Press Your Luck.

1147
01:24:39,726 --> 01:24:41,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the same people that did the new Price is Right game.

1148
01:24:42,008 --> 01:24:43,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not just for PC.

1149
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:45,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be coming for iPods,

1150
01:24:45,812 --> 01:24:48,274
[SPEAKER_10]: iPhone, and apparently, consoles.

1151
01:24:48,874 --> 01:25:03,805
[SPEAKER_10]: So the people that got the prices right, now unfortunately I haven't played the prices right game, so I don't know if it's any good or not, but what's kind of exciting about it is that it's got, you know, if it's a new game, it's going to have new whammy animations and all that fun stuff.

1152
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:06,167
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be an awesome party game.

1153
01:25:06,187 --> 01:25:07,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to have the sound...

1154
01:25:09,406 --> 01:25:10,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what you mean.

1155
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:40,689
[SPEAKER_10]: GameShows are awesome!

1156
01:26:00,854 --> 01:26:03,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Spore is not one of the games that's mentioned in the lawsuits.

1157
01:26:04,757 --> 01:26:09,220
[SPEAKER_09]: The trial version of Spore Creature Creator was, and the full version of The Sims.

1158
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they say that it constitutes unlawful and deceptive business practices.

1159
01:26:15,184 --> 01:26:20,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And both suits, I guess, seek class action status.

1160
01:26:21,008 --> 01:26:27,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess there was also a third lawsuit that was filed back in September for the Digital Rights Management for Spore.

1161
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:28,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1162
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:35,254
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1163
01:26:56,589 --> 01:27:04,394
[SPEAKER_09]: The trial made no mention of any technical protection measures, digital rights management, or Securom whatsoever.

1164
01:27:04,974 --> 01:27:15,380
[SPEAKER_09]: The second suit was filed from a woman in Missouri, saying that after installing the DRM-protected Sims 2 Bon Voyage, she began experiencing problems with her PC.

1165
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:19,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Backup CDs with Sims 2 game content were no longer recognized by her computer.

1166
01:27:20,422 --> 01:27:24,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Neither were files saved on her USB drive or the iPod.

1167
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:38,813
[SPEAKER_09]: She rid herself of the DRM and the problems only by reformatting her PC and she accuses EA of engaging in unfair business practices as well as conducting immoral, unethical, impressive, and unscrupulous behavior.

1168
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:43,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in other words, EA got sued over Secure ROM.

1169
01:27:43,736 --> 01:27:44,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's surprised.

1170
01:27:44,657 --> 01:27:45,997
[SPEAKER_10]: But is it going to hold up?

1171
01:27:46,277 --> 01:27:46,678
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

1172
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:50,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, well, I don't have...

1173
01:27:52,085 --> 01:28:06,291
[SPEAKER_09]: If they came out and disclosed that Sekiram was in there, and if they made sure that there weren't any side effects, like it interferes with your CD burning software or whatever, then I don't think people have a problem.

1174
01:28:06,311 --> 01:28:09,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it should be displayed on the box saying that this contains this.

1175
01:28:09,972 --> 01:28:12,773
[SPEAKER_09]: If you install this, this is what's going to happen.

1176
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:18,736
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they don't say that it's in there and it just installs without telling anybody anything, I don't think that's right.

1177
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:20,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially on these demos.

1178
01:28:21,355 --> 01:28:22,836
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the real tricky part.

1179
01:28:22,976 --> 01:28:25,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you buy the game... Who cares?

1180
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:25,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a demo.

1181
01:28:25,877 --> 01:28:26,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand, you know?

1182
01:28:27,877 --> 01:28:30,858
[SPEAKER_09]: You know... I don't get it.

1183
01:28:31,438 --> 01:28:31,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1184
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:32,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll see what happens.

1185
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:43,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to get to tonight's mailbag, but I thought tonight maybe... DarkSakura's taking a break from the mailbag because she wasn't even supposed to be here until Part B. I thought maybe we could change up the theme a little bit for tonight's mailbag.

1186
01:28:43,921 --> 01:28:46,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollywood, it's time to press your luck!

1187
01:28:53,418 --> 01:29:00,481
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1188
01:29:01,862 --> 01:29:04,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, that spore level is so getting pulled off.

1189
01:29:05,324 --> 01:29:05,644
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1190
01:29:05,944 --> 01:29:07,044
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a spore level now?

1191
01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:07,945
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be funny.

1192
01:29:08,185 --> 01:29:08,765
[SPEAKER_10]: They should do that.

1193
01:29:10,406 --> 01:29:13,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, we need to continue the theme music here for tonight's mailbag.

1194
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:13,908
... ...

1195
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:35,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I could go on and on.

1196
01:29:36,244 --> 01:29:38,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently tonight's... I love that sound.

1197
01:29:38,765 --> 01:29:41,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do.

1198
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:42,347
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the best sound ever.

1199
01:29:42,607 --> 01:29:43,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to get that for the show.

1200
01:29:44,388 --> 01:29:45,389
[SPEAKER_10]: We can use that a little later on.

1201
01:29:46,209 --> 01:29:52,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, I think the whammies hit our mailbag this week because there's not a lot available in tonight's mailbag.

1202
01:29:52,192 --> 01:29:55,594
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.

1203
01:29:57,534 --> 01:30:02,598
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a few emails we'll get into, starting off with an email about LittleBigPlanet from Rob with two Bs.

1204
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:04,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Jamie will appreciate this a lot.

1205
01:30:05,461 --> 01:30:08,544
[SPEAKER_10]: This article has a video of a Gradius level in LittleBigPlanet.

1206
01:30:08,644 --> 01:30:10,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if it's accessible on American servers.

1207
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:11,847
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer your question, yes it is.

1208
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:16,230
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it's on page one right now of the American servers of the favorite levels.

1209
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:16,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a...

1210
01:30:18,432 --> 01:30:23,337
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not exact like Gradius, but they did a pretty darn good job with the remake there.

1211
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:28,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously, we've already talked about these remakes earlier in the show, but I wanted to mention this from Rob's email.

1212
01:30:28,782 --> 01:30:29,603
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awesome.

1213
01:30:30,364 --> 01:30:31,265
[SPEAKER_10]: The quote here at the end.

1214
01:30:31,645 --> 01:30:38,672
[SPEAKER_10]: This just goes to show you, sometimes the best way to make something behave differently is to circumvent the pre-programmed behavior.

1215
01:30:40,033 --> 01:30:40,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1216
01:30:42,669 --> 01:30:46,234
[SPEAKER_10]: An email from... well, it's not signed.

1217
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:51,381
[SPEAKER_10]: It was something forwarded to us from the BBC News website from NIJ.

1218
01:30:51,442 --> 01:30:52,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll leave it at that.

1219
01:30:52,884 --> 01:30:55,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Sent us something like this, but I thought this was an interesting story.

1220
01:30:56,148 --> 01:30:59,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamers dressing up as their favorite hero for a record.

1221
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:28,509
[SPEAKER_10]: and this is a story from the official BBC website from the 26th of October so it looks like the same day as our last show but apparently it was like this giant like cosplay record type thing 342 people posed Final Fantasy, Zelda, so on part of the London Games Festival and the funny thing is they were out there to top the record of 337 set the week before in Germany who knew that World War 3 would be fought with cosplay who knew

1222
01:31:30,339 --> 01:31:30,880
[SPEAKER_10]: But there you go.

1223
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:34,304
[SPEAKER_10]: A whole little article there on the BBC website if you want to see it.

1224
01:31:35,025 --> 01:31:37,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, are you looking at the video of the level that Rob sent?

1225
01:31:37,884 --> 01:31:39,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, not the one that he sent.

1226
01:31:39,384 --> 01:31:40,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I just happened to find one on YouTube.

1227
01:31:40,965 --> 01:31:42,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get that in LittleBigPlanet still right now.

1228
01:31:42,905 --> 01:31:44,086
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fantastic.

1229
01:31:46,346 --> 01:31:47,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we learned this.

1230
01:31:47,887 --> 01:31:51,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you actually save levels from online to your planet and stuff?

1231
01:31:51,828 --> 01:31:57,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the phone call we had with Bobby at the end of his show, he was telling us that there's an option you can do that.

1232
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:57,970
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I hope so.

1233
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to go save that one.

1234
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,711
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow, we got another email here.

1235
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:02,351
[SPEAKER_10]: One last email.

1236
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:05,332
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit lengthy, but that's all right since we didn't have a whole lot of emails tonight.

1237
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:06,272
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's from Spazinator.

1238
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:08,207
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1239
01:32:26,364 --> 01:32:28,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I particularly like the Justin.TV feed.

1240
01:32:28,345 --> 01:32:33,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I'll listen and watch that way from now on rather than the All Games Radio feed on Shoutcast on my PSP.

1241
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now our All Games friends wouldn't like that very much.

1242
01:32:36,788 --> 01:32:37,428
[SPEAKER_10]: You should do both.

1243
01:32:37,608 --> 01:32:38,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Ideally, you do both.

1244
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:42,190
[SPEAKER_10]: You turn on the Justin.TV and mute it and then listen on the All Games feed.

1245
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:45,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the Justin.TV unfortunately has shitty audio.

1246
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:48,312
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these days we'll fix it, I promise, but for right now.

1247
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:52,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly to Rob, congrats on getting yourself a PlayStation 3.

1248
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:53,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the dark side.

1249
01:32:54,262 --> 01:32:57,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Just out of sheer stupid curiosity, what model did you end up getting?

1250
01:32:57,944 --> 01:33:03,848
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that ideally the 60GB is the best to get, but they're impossible to find new and even a used one is a pain in the arse to find.

1251
01:33:04,488 --> 01:33:05,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're right.

1252
01:33:05,809 --> 01:33:07,870
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of one of those things where beggars can't be choosers.

1253
01:33:08,531 --> 01:33:10,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought the 80GB, the new one.

1254
01:33:10,672 --> 01:33:15,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't play PlayStation 2 games, which does suck, but at least I have a PlayStation 2.

1255
01:33:16,356 --> 01:33:17,796
[SPEAKER_10]: And it does play Blu-rays and all that stuff.

1256
01:33:18,357 --> 01:33:18,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.

1257
01:33:19,622 --> 01:33:22,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, hey, no, we're not ready for one gun music yet.

1258
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:23,883
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our break music tonight.

1259
01:33:24,563 --> 01:33:29,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, speaking of PlayStation 3 and whatnot, I'd like to put something out there for you and the other listeners.

1260
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:37,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Mind you, this is not fact, merely speculation with a certain amount of logic supporting this, and it may or may not be proven wrong by the time you're out with episode 301.

1261
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:43,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm speculating that PlayStation 3's home will most likely be out by no later than November 19th.

1262
01:33:44,028 --> 01:33:44,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Out by then.

1263
01:34:02,509 --> 01:34:06,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, this is just speculation on my end, and I have no inside sources or anything.

1264
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to invoke logic into this and look at it from a business point of view.

1265
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:11,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I may be proven wrong on this.

1266
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:14,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been wrong in my life, but I suppose in theory it could conceivably happen.

1267
01:34:14,205 --> 01:34:14,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha ha.

1268
01:34:15,728 --> 01:34:20,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I close my email, I'd just like to add that if you'd like, you can send me your friend request on PlayStation Network.

1269
01:34:20,731 --> 01:34:24,613
[SPEAKER_10]: As my Xbox Live Gamer Tag suggests, my PlayStation Network handle is Spazinator.

1270
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,694
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll often find me on LittleBigPlanet.

1271
01:34:26,734 --> 01:34:30,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, I'm making a level with flaming boobs and electric nipples.

1272
01:34:30,396 --> 01:34:32,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that won't get pulled or anything.

1273
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,699
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, an email from Spazinator.

1274
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,420
[SPEAKER_04]: The grottiest level is well done.

1275
01:34:37,821 --> 01:34:39,982
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking fantastic, isn't it?

1276
01:34:41,751 --> 01:34:46,035
[SPEAKER_10]: I think after the show, I think we should run in the house and download the level before it's gone.

1277
01:34:47,716 --> 01:34:48,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1278
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:50,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be gone in a couple hours because it was on page one.

1279
01:34:50,438 --> 01:34:51,299
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, it is Sunday.

1280
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,420
[SPEAKER_10]: But not in Europe.

1281
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:53,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.

1282
01:34:54,601 --> 01:34:55,422
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be Monday morning.

1283
01:34:55,442 --> 01:34:56,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I just found LittleBigMacross.

1284
01:34:57,604 --> 01:35:01,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're assuming that it's Media Monocle doing this stuff.

1285
01:35:01,627 --> 01:35:03,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it might actually be Sony.

1286
01:35:03,969 --> 01:35:04,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1287
01:35:04,509 --> 01:35:04,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

1288
01:35:04,889 --> 01:35:05,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I am assuming that.

1289
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:06,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1290
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,712
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1291
01:35:09,032 --> 01:35:09,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

1292
01:35:10,529 --> 01:35:11,930
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a little more news to get to.

1293
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:17,013
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to get your emails in for next week, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

1294
01:35:17,673 --> 01:35:28,760
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as that previous email and the whole release date, I'm sure it's one of those things where Sony would like to do it, but they're really going to try to not release something that's broken.

1295
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,001
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it's broken, they're going to take the time to fix it.

1296
01:35:31,141 --> 01:35:35,363
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they've been doing for the past year and a half.

1297
01:35:35,403 --> 01:35:38,125
[SPEAKER_10]: If they can one-up Microsoft by making their thing better...

1298
01:35:38,925 --> 01:35:49,271
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll wait, but they'll have it out by Christmas, which doesn't leave a lot of time because I would think they'd want to have the buzz starting right before the Thanksgiving rush, but I don't work for Sony.

1299
01:35:49,572 --> 01:35:50,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what they think sometimes.

1300
01:35:51,593 --> 01:35:51,893
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1301
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:54,945
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1302
01:35:54,965 --> 01:35:55,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I was watching a video.

1303
01:35:55,866 --> 01:35:57,287
[SPEAKER_09]: They have Sack to the Future.

1304
01:35:57,707 --> 01:35:59,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that level got pulled off.

1305
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is sweet.

1306
01:36:01,269 --> 01:36:01,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

1307
01:36:01,849 --> 01:36:02,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, Jamie.

1308
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:03,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Best game I've played in years.

1309
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:05,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the Macross level.

1310
01:36:05,652 --> 01:36:06,612
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an amazing game.

1311
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:07,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

1312
01:36:07,393 --> 01:36:07,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1313
01:36:07,993 --> 01:36:17,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, something that's been actually a trend and is now actually happening with almost every single PS3 game that comes out.

1314
01:36:17,599 --> 01:36:18,579
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, installs.

1315
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they have an...

1316
01:36:21,841 --> 01:36:25,203
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is an optional install, but it is an install nonetheless.

1317
01:36:26,564 --> 01:36:40,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy Dissida, or Dissida or whatever, on the PSP, it now has a data install option that will allow you to install a portion of the game onto your memory unit so that you can load faster.

1318
01:36:41,011 --> 01:36:43,833
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of interesting that they have the memory stick install function on there.

1319
01:36:43,853 --> 01:36:46,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting that they're admitting the load times are going to suck.

1320
01:36:47,471 --> 01:36:48,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that too.

1321
01:36:48,952 --> 01:36:49,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1322
01:36:50,052 --> 01:36:54,214
[SPEAKER_09]: It says they have different install options.

1323
01:36:54,494 --> 01:37:00,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You can take as little as 245 megabytes and as much as 528 megabytes.

1324
01:37:04,957 --> 01:37:05,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

1325
01:37:06,338 --> 01:37:07,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed, very interesting.

1326
01:37:07,638 --> 01:37:10,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just overclock your system with a custom firmware.

1327
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:12,320
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my option.

1328
01:37:13,399 --> 01:37:16,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, or just run the whole game off of a memory stick.

1329
01:37:18,762 --> 01:37:20,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Entertainment asked a good question in chat.

1330
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:22,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this further facilitate piracy?

1331
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:22,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

1332
01:37:22,985 --> 01:37:25,426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so rampant anyways.

1333
01:37:25,687 --> 01:37:27,688
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're not installing the whole game to the memory card.

1334
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:32,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And besides, they're going to start offering their first party games as downloads anyways.

1335
01:37:32,111 --> 01:37:33,091
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

1336
01:37:33,651 --> 01:37:34,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Very true.

1337
01:37:35,192 --> 01:37:39,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back though.

1338
01:37:39,795 --> 01:37:42,017
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty more to come in Part B. Um...

1339
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:49,425
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk the latest in gaming news and we're finally going to talk about where Jamie was at at the start of the next episode.

1340
01:37:50,026 --> 01:37:51,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Not episode, at the start of the next segment.

1341
01:37:51,847 --> 01:37:56,150
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1342
01:38:03,112 --> 01:38:07,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.

1343
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:09,775
[SPEAKER_10]: We're taping live on November 9th, 2008.

1344
01:38:10,996 --> 01:38:15,979
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura joined us in the middle of part A. And we want to talk about something.

1345
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:22,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to kind of get away from the topic of games for a minute, but remember that Orange Lounge Radio was...

1346
01:38:22,682 --> 01:38:23,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

1347
01:38:44,921 --> 01:38:56,067
[SPEAKER_10]: and also in part from the conversations that we would have after a long night of DDR at the restaurant that was in the arcade parking lot practically, you know, just kind of the topics that would come up, games and other things.

1348
01:38:57,988 --> 01:39:10,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously one thing that's been on my mind weighing a little heavy this week is Proposition 8, which is, you know, we did great things in this country this week.

1349
01:39:10,714 --> 01:39:12,955
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican or

1350
01:39:13,688 --> 01:39:42,287
[SPEAKER_10]: just the fact that we've elected a president that I think 40 years ago no one would have ever imagined would have been the type of person this nation would elect is really outstanding and I thought McCain was very gracious in his speech and it's really great things are going to happen here in America I think on that front but it was really hard to kind of watch all that go on and see people celebrating and say the civil rights glass ceilings have been shattered and so on and so on

1351
01:39:43,007 --> 01:39:48,048
[SPEAKER_10]: and then to watch Proposition 8 pass by four points, 52 to 48.

1352
01:39:49,528 --> 01:39:59,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're not familiar with Proposition 8 and you've been listening to this show, Proposition 8 took away the right here in California of same-sex couples to marry.

1353
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:09,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And what makes this different from the similar propositions in Arizona, Florida and the other states that have all passed laws like this is that this time in California, you took something away.

1354
01:40:10,293 --> 01:40:11,274
[SPEAKER_10]: by passing Proposition 8.

1355
01:40:35,342 --> 01:40:36,343
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1356
01:40:58,183 --> 01:41:08,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a really interesting message from somebody on Facebook, from a friend, who was apologizing because it was their fault.

1357
01:41:09,032 --> 01:41:09,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1358
01:41:09,713 --> 01:41:11,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a lot to think about about this whole thing.

1359
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:18,420
[SPEAKER_10]: It's disappointing, obviously, because my question to those out there is...

1360
01:41:19,554 --> 01:41:20,935
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you so afraid of?

1361
01:41:22,015 --> 01:41:24,237
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the big deal?

1362
01:41:25,277 --> 01:41:30,681
[SPEAKER_10]: If people you don't even know aren't required to associate with, get married.

1363
01:41:31,661 --> 01:41:35,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't give me this crap that civil unions are the same thing as marriage.

1364
01:41:35,884 --> 01:41:36,844
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not true.

1365
01:41:37,144 --> 01:41:39,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you one example of how they're different and one's enough.

1366
01:41:40,767 --> 01:41:46,190
[SPEAKER_10]: In a civil union, if my partner... In a civil union, if I pass away...

1367
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:53,623
[SPEAKER_10]: My partner would not be able to stake legal claims to my possessions before my immediate relatives.

1368
01:41:54,503 --> 01:42:09,834
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm estranged from my relatives, which one of my relatives in my family I'm estranged from, and unfortunately because people are afraid of gayness for whatever reason, they're estranged in their own families, that could be a real issue in a lot of families.

1369
01:42:10,815 --> 01:42:11,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's one.

1370
01:42:11,715 --> 01:42:12,156
[SPEAKER_10]: One's enough.

1371
01:42:12,396 --> 01:42:13,296
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a difference.

1372
01:42:13,617 --> 01:42:15,178
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more than just the one, but one's enough.

1373
01:42:16,718 --> 01:42:19,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's not the same thing as civil unions.

1374
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,261
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not protected.

1375
01:42:20,841 --> 01:42:21,501
[SPEAKER_10]: All this BS.

1376
01:42:21,822 --> 01:42:25,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, how did Proposition 8, how did these people win the campaign?

1377
01:42:25,844 --> 01:42:28,686
[SPEAKER_10]: By using children and this whole schools thing.

1378
01:42:29,147 --> 01:42:32,389
[SPEAKER_10]: If we don't pass this proposition, they're going to teach it in schools.

1379
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:38,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Logic tells you they were lying.

1380
01:42:38,453 --> 01:42:39,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the logic.

1381
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:42,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Gay marriage was already legal.

1382
01:42:42,717 --> 01:42:46,220
[SPEAKER_10]: So if what they were saying is true, they would already be teaching it in schools.

1383
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,701
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's my other question.

1384
01:42:49,654 --> 01:42:51,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So what if they teach it in schools?

1385
01:42:52,395 --> 01:42:52,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So what?

1386
01:42:54,435 --> 01:43:02,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that might strike a lot of people a little weird, but when it's appropriate to talk about marriage and relationship, do you think they're not going to hear it anyway?

1387
01:43:02,756 --> 01:43:03,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me, folks.

1388
01:43:04,157 --> 01:43:05,337
[SPEAKER_10]: These kids are going to hear it.

1389
01:43:05,897 --> 01:43:08,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I got called a fag for 18 years growing up.

1390
01:43:09,197 --> 01:43:18,199
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the hardest part for me to come out of the closet was having to admit that all these assholes who gave me such a hard time in very difficult parts of my life were right.

1391
01:43:20,524 --> 01:43:22,926
[SPEAKER_10]: and do you think it's something I chose?

1392
01:43:23,566 --> 01:43:28,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, God, that's something that pisses me off more than anything is hearing this whole being gay is a choice.

1393
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:32,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I assure you I am not being paid off by anybody to say this.

1394
01:43:32,912 --> 01:43:34,133
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not a choice.

1395
01:43:34,773 --> 01:43:36,435
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way I was born.

1396
01:43:36,475 --> 01:43:41,898
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way God, Mother Nature, whatever you believe in, made me.

1397
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:47,542
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ask again, what are these people so afraid of?

1398
01:43:49,793 --> 01:43:51,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura, where were you today?

1399
01:43:52,037 --> 01:43:59,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the repeal Proposition 8 rally on the Capitol steps, and it was amazing.

1400
01:44:00,121 --> 01:44:01,001
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of things were going on?

1401
01:44:01,982 --> 01:44:03,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There were just a lot of speakers.

1402
01:44:03,342 --> 01:44:08,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was in a place where it was very difficult to hear anybody until I got closer.

1403
01:44:08,765 --> 01:44:15,748
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my good friends, Becky, her choir sang on the steps during the rally.

1404
01:44:15,768 --> 01:44:16,548
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all very good.

1405
01:44:16,568 --> 01:44:17,869
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a couple of speakers there.

1406
01:44:18,689 --> 01:44:20,110
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was a school commissioner.

1407
01:44:21,951 --> 01:44:30,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was there with her family, and they managed to get in right before they weren't doing any more weddings.

1408
01:44:30,378 --> 01:44:32,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was there with her family.

1409
01:44:33,962 --> 01:44:43,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And talking about how a big thing that she said is there's not going to be any teaching of gay marriage in school because we don't teach marriage in school.

1410
01:44:45,252 --> 01:44:51,316
[SPEAKER_10]: If the superintendent is on my television saying they don't have to teach it in schools, I don't know.

1411
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe him.

1412
01:44:52,717 --> 01:44:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another one.

1413
01:44:54,418 --> 01:45:00,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what she did in San Francisco, but one of the elected officials there.

1414
01:45:02,905 --> 01:45:05,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But she was just saying that...

1415
01:45:08,076 --> 01:45:14,980
[SPEAKER_04]: She gave this really great speech just talking about going into debates against the Mormon representatives.

1416
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:18,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was pretty crazy to hear about.

1417
01:45:19,763 --> 01:45:23,645
[SPEAKER_04]: There was just a lot of really good energy there today.

1418
01:45:25,566 --> 01:45:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was on the same page, it seemed.

1419
01:45:27,727 --> 01:45:32,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you what else was really kind of interesting.

1420
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:36,512
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an idea that I've been working on with some friends of mine.

1421
01:45:37,272 --> 01:45:59,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, about, uh, we're saying that it was the simple, that it was basically a popularity contest, a simple majority when it, and this has been said for the past, at least as long as I've been in California and I don't see anyone really have authoring anything about it, that any amendment to our constitution, it basically only takes a simple majority when our budget takes a two thirds majority.

1422
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:03,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if civil, okay.

1423
01:46:03,072 --> 01:46:03,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And how, okay.

1424
01:46:04,013 --> 01:46:05,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, prop two passed, right?

1425
01:46:05,848 --> 01:46:06,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the chicken thing.

1426
01:46:07,129 --> 01:46:10,792
[SPEAKER_04]: If chickens have more rights than people, what does that say?

1427
01:46:11,693 --> 01:46:14,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to belittle Prop 2 because it was important in its own way.

1428
01:46:14,955 --> 01:46:16,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 2 is a waste of money.

1429
01:46:16,977 --> 01:46:18,799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a funny contradiction.

1430
01:46:18,979 --> 01:46:19,559
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1431
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Prop 2 is also a massive waste of money.

1432
01:46:23,222 --> 01:46:25,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry for being so political, but damn it.

1433
01:46:25,864 --> 01:46:27,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I've put in six and a half years on this show.

1434
01:46:27,486 --> 01:46:28,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I can take ten minutes to get political.

1435
01:46:29,627 --> 01:46:29,707
[SPEAKER_10]: If...

1436
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:41,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so angry, mostly, at the people who shed tears for civil rights being broken in this country, on one hand.

1437
01:46:42,162 --> 01:46:46,723
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the other hand, deny me something I might want someday.

1438
01:46:48,483 --> 01:46:50,663
[SPEAKER_10]: You think some people would know better.

1439
01:46:51,203 --> 01:46:52,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just disgusting.

1440
01:46:53,504 --> 01:46:59,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you can say this whole, well, can't, you know, the majority talk is just the way it's going to be, da-da-da.

1441
01:46:59,445 --> 01:46:59,485
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1442
01:46:59,665 --> 01:46:59,765
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1443
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:18,349
[SPEAKER_10]: because you know what the majority isn't always right and that's what's what's happened in the past what we've seen happen in the past is that you know when that's why we have the Supreme Court and the courts in California to point out the flaws of the majority when they're wrong

1444
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:33,807
[SPEAKER_10]: But what this has really done for this community, and I'm not talking just the gay community, I'm talking the people who are not going to stand up for treating people differently community, is it's really mobilized it.

1445
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:40,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think in a way, especially kind of on the tail end of what you see kind of happening with the whole Obama, yes we can, rah, rah, rah.

1446
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:43,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're really going to see a movement happen here.

1447
01:47:43,752 --> 01:47:50,639
[SPEAKER_10]: But as one email said that I got and that I tend to agree with just in general things I say, I think this is an issue destined for the Supreme Court eventually anyway.

1448
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope they're on the right side.

1449
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:58,126
[SPEAKER_10]: History says they will be, but I don't know.

1450
01:47:58,226 --> 01:47:59,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the pessimist in me starts to worry.

1451
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:01,309
[SPEAKER_10]: But what can we do?

1452
01:48:01,709 --> 01:48:02,830
[SPEAKER_10]: What do I bring it up?

1453
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:06,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I bring it up on this program related to video games?

1454
01:48:06,934 --> 01:48:09,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, folks, you've been on Xbox Live.

1455
01:48:09,176 --> 01:48:10,597
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been on these things.

1456
01:48:10,857 --> 01:48:13,339
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard gay, gay, gay, fag, fag, fag.

1457
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:17,522
[SPEAKER_10]: This week, 48 hours ago, I am not making this up.

1458
01:48:17,662 --> 01:48:23,987
[SPEAKER_10]: On World of Warcraft, I ganked some level 3 gnome who is flagged outside of Orgrimmar.

1459
01:48:24,147 --> 01:48:28,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Why you would flag yourself on a PvE server when you're level 3, you're just begging for it.

1460
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:31,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I ganked him right outside of Orgrimmar.

1461
01:48:31,772 --> 01:48:35,195
[SPEAKER_10]: He signed on to his horde character and said, what's your problem, fag?

1462
01:48:37,614 --> 01:48:40,715
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is an issue that kind of goes into video games because you know what?

1463
01:48:40,755 --> 01:48:50,876
[SPEAKER_10]: When that shit happens, gay, straight, black, white, brown, Martian, I don't give a shit who you are.

1464
01:48:51,697 --> 01:48:52,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

1465
01:48:52,997 --> 01:48:54,897
[SPEAKER_10]: There is nothing to be afraid of.

1466
01:48:54,917 --> 01:49:01,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you say that stuff, you're trying to throw it out there that somehow you're belittling it.

1467
01:49:01,918 --> 01:49:02,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different.

1468
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:05,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this is where this all stems from.

1469
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:10,592
[SPEAKER_10]: You deny gays the right to marry because you're afraid of people who are different.

1470
01:49:12,613 --> 01:49:13,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So just knock it off.

1471
01:49:18,416 --> 01:49:19,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess that's all I have to say.

1472
01:49:20,177 --> 01:49:21,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's ridiculous anyway.

1473
01:49:22,898 --> 01:49:23,179
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1474
01:49:23,539 --> 01:49:31,843
[SPEAKER_10]: But when the real world sucks, we turn to video games to escape and go to a happier place where I rule things like in populace.

1475
01:49:31,983 --> 01:49:32,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1476
01:49:32,864 --> 01:49:33,964
[SPEAKER_04]: One more politically.

1477
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:34,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, sure, sure.

1478
01:49:35,526 --> 01:49:37,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you majority voters of Arkansas.

1479
01:49:39,151 --> 01:49:42,335
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole nother issue that, oh my god.

1480
01:49:43,376 --> 01:49:44,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I could spend another episode on that.

1481
01:49:45,058 --> 01:49:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That earned its own FU too.

1482
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:48,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Say what?

1483
01:49:49,604 --> 01:49:51,747
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what happened in Arkansas?

1484
01:49:51,827 --> 01:49:53,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Only married couples can adopt.

1485
01:49:54,031 --> 01:49:56,874
[SPEAKER_10]: and because gay people can't get married, they can't adopt.

1486
01:49:57,195 --> 01:50:01,399
[SPEAKER_10]: But what about, I don't know, what about... How many more children does that put into the system?

1487
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't even foster children.

1488
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:04,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just adoption.

1489
01:50:04,282 --> 01:50:10,089
[SPEAKER_10]: What if grandma wants to adopt the kids because the parents died and grandma's husband died?

1490
01:50:10,669 --> 01:50:11,891
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes no sense.

1491
01:50:12,011 --> 01:50:13,072
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so flawed.

1492
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,775
[SPEAKER_10]: This all spurns from people's...

1493
01:50:17,148 --> 01:50:22,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ignorance and stupidity and hate and people just need to learn to shut up.

1494
01:50:22,433 --> 01:50:26,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope the listeners of the show are smarter than that.

1495
01:50:28,358 --> 01:50:28,798
[SPEAKER_03]: One would hope.

1496
01:50:28,818 --> 01:50:31,801
[SPEAKER_10]: But I got an email this week telling me maybe not.

1497
01:50:32,922 --> 01:50:35,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think a lot of people have a lot of thinking to do.

1498
01:50:35,844 --> 01:50:42,010
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am not going to stand by and let you take my rights away.

1499
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:45,892
[SPEAKER_10]: because that's what you did this week.

1500
01:50:46,514 --> 01:50:47,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to video games.

1501
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:53,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Activision has taken away some...

1502
01:50:54,372 --> 01:50:58,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Songs that people have put up on Guitar Hero World Tour servers.

1503
01:50:59,013 --> 01:51:02,254
[SPEAKER_09]: The GH Tunes service that they have available.

1504
01:51:03,495 --> 01:51:06,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, of course, it's not a big surprise.

1505
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:09,236
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stuff that's sort of copyrighted.

1506
01:51:09,837 --> 01:51:14,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Zelda tracks, Mario themed stuff.

1507
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:21,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically those have come offline as well as any other tracks that sort of sound like

1508
01:51:22,478 --> 01:51:27,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that this track editor thing in Guitar Hero is kind of a bitch to use too.

1509
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:30,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again, just like LittleBigPlanet, we have a case where we have a lot of...

1510
01:51:49,159 --> 01:51:57,582
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people that put in a lot of time into this stuff to copy something else that's out there, I guess, to emulate it or what have you, only to end up having it deleted.

1511
01:51:58,302 --> 01:52:00,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So are people kind of getting pissed off about it?

1512
01:52:00,663 --> 01:52:02,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, people aren't too happy about it.

1513
01:52:02,404 --> 01:52:09,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things, though, at least with this, is you can download those tracks and then save them to your system.

1514
01:52:09,746 --> 01:52:15,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you happen to have gotten one of these songs, better not delete it because you're not going to be able to get it again unless someone else throws it up there.

1515
01:52:15,668 --> 01:52:17,409
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe, I don't know, you should...

1516
01:52:18,089 --> 01:52:21,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw it up there and not name it like Zelda theme or something like that.

1517
01:52:21,893 --> 01:52:23,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a good idea.

1518
01:52:24,375 --> 01:52:25,997
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

1519
01:52:27,639 --> 01:52:33,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty soon, if it expands like they say there, it'll be really hard to monitor it.

1520
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:44,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of curiosity, and sorry, I'm being distracted by all the chat stemming from the last 10 minutes of the show in chat room right now, so sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now.

1521
01:52:45,053 --> 01:52:50,414
[SPEAKER_10]: But has there been any really good original works to kind of come out of this too?

1522
01:52:51,615 --> 01:52:58,096
[SPEAKER_10]: All I hear about are, at least in LittleBigPlanet, I've heard something about there's these really good original levels too, but I haven't heard so much about it in Guitar Hero.

1523
01:52:58,416 --> 01:52:58,877
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1524
01:52:58,957 --> 01:53:01,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard a lot about the original songs to come out of it.

1525
01:53:01,657 --> 01:53:03,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if there's bands out there that are putting...

1526
01:53:04,698 --> 01:53:05,359
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1527
01:53:26,707 --> 01:53:33,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Activision or whomever has not heard of them and wouldn't even know that it's copyright material.

1528
01:53:34,934 --> 01:53:40,098
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bobby's in chat right now and says most people who write original songs gave up on the stupid music creator mode like me.

1529
01:53:41,278 --> 01:53:42,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band Rock Band Rock Band

1530
01:54:00,798 --> 01:54:21,335
[SPEAKER_10]: and there is a download pack coming out very soon it's the Foo Fighters Color and the Shape album and you know the song Everlong is from that album it's already in the game and it's a lot of fun to play even if it's a bitch but there's some other great songs that are going to be available as a part of this Monkey Wrench I believe was one of the singles there My Hero of course is another big song from that album so the Color and the Shape album

1531
01:54:21,795 --> 01:54:24,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely a landmark album by the Foo Fighters is the next release.

1532
01:54:25,177 --> 01:54:31,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, just wanted to say real quick, apparently some of the free rock band songs have started to hit as well.

1533
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I downloaded those finally.

1534
01:54:33,641 --> 01:54:35,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played any of them, but I downloaded them.

1535
01:54:35,962 --> 01:54:38,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I still haven't even redeemed my dang code.

1536
01:54:38,243 --> 01:54:39,824
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's awesome?

1537
01:54:39,884 --> 01:54:42,085
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend has been playing my copy of Rock Band 2.

1538
01:54:42,425 --> 01:54:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Our band now is in the top 500.

1539
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:45,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1540
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:46,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1541
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:48,451
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome for me not playing the game at all.

1542
01:54:48,771 --> 01:54:49,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang, he must be really good.

1543
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:50,871
[SPEAKER_09]: He is really good.

1544
01:54:51,011 --> 01:54:51,492
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1545
01:54:51,852 --> 01:54:52,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for him.

1546
01:54:53,632 --> 01:54:54,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I distracted him, though.

1547
01:54:54,532 --> 01:54:57,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a free copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, so he's been playing that.

1548
01:54:57,273 --> 01:55:01,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to go back to Xbox, though, and go back to Rock Band for one reason, and it's the reason we talked about two weeks ago.

1549
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:05,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't gotten my Suzy and the Banshees songs, and I really need to do that.

1550
01:55:05,635 --> 01:55:07,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a new drum set I bought.

1551
01:55:07,796 --> 01:55:11,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought the Rock Band 2 drum set that's been sitting in my Rock Band drum bag.

1552
01:55:12,717 --> 01:55:32,023
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm not playing it until I get my rock band cymbals for it which supposedly are coming in tomorrow cross our fingers so hopefully once I get the cymbals then I'll start playing my new drum set but until then I'm not touching it alright we'll see what happens but there's other rock band news yes?

1553
01:55:32,827 --> 01:55:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.

1554
01:55:33,348 --> 01:55:38,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Song Pack 2 has been confirmed, and there's a list up here if anyone wants to hear it.

1555
01:55:39,516 --> 01:55:44,583
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, by the way, though, the one song costs 160 Microsoft points, but...

1556
01:55:49,481 --> 01:55:53,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're supposed to have some sort of deal on buying the whole thing.

1557
01:55:54,223 --> 01:55:55,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's what's going up.

1558
01:55:56,203 --> 01:56:02,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, Call Me by Blondie, El Scorcho Weezer, Girl You Want by Devo.

1559
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:03,766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cool song.

1560
01:56:04,626 --> 01:56:13,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls Who Play Guitars by Maxima Park, Indestructible by Disturbed, It Hurts, Angels and Airwaves, Just What I Needed, The Cars, Message in a Bottle, Yes, Finally!

1561
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:17,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I downloaded that song a long time ago.

1562
01:56:17,451 --> 01:56:18,011
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's...

1563
01:56:19,465 --> 01:56:30,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Monkey Gone to Heaven by the Pixies Rio Duran Duran Saints of Los Angeles by Motley Crue Simple Man, Leonard Skinner, Snow, Heyo by Red Hot Chili Peppers The Perfect Drug, Nine Inch Nails The Saint of Scene, It's an Arms Race by Fall Out Boy which I like that song too

1564
01:56:47,123 --> 01:56:53,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Time is Running Out, Papa Roach, Why Do You Love Me, Garbage, You've Got Another Thing Comin', Judas Priest, and Zero, Smashing Pumpkins.

1565
01:56:53,248 --> 01:56:53,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a bad track list.

1566
01:56:54,249 --> 01:56:54,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.

1567
01:56:55,731 --> 01:57:03,437
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of neat about that, though, or different, is that I noticed that some of the things they pulled for that game come from the album releases.

1568
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:05,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, the Pixies track was from the album release.

1569
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:08,942
[SPEAKER_10]: The Heyo Red Hot Chili Peppers was from the album release.

1570
01:57:09,262 --> 01:57:09,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of interesting.

1571
01:57:10,703 --> 01:57:13,746
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just single track releases they picked from.

1572
01:57:13,786 --> 01:57:14,606
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really a...

1573
01:57:15,407 --> 01:57:36,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Smorgasbord of the different things they've released for Rock Band which I think is interesting yeah and what's also cool about that too is once again with this you can actually import those songs into Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1 or you can play the game as a standalone game if you want oh that's kind of neat how would that work on the Wii though?

1574
01:57:37,702 --> 01:57:38,162
[SPEAKER_09]: on the Wii.

1575
01:57:38,803 --> 01:57:41,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how they're going to... I don't know if you can import them on the Wii.

1576
01:57:42,005 --> 01:57:49,111
[SPEAKER_09]: It might just be like a standalone thing, although they may be adding that later on, because now they're going to have actual download songs for the Wii stuff.

1577
01:57:49,791 --> 01:57:51,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

1578
01:57:51,433 --> 01:57:52,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Soon, I guess.

1579
01:57:52,934 --> 01:57:58,498
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just like printing money, though, for Harmonix and EA and MTV and the folks behind this game, though.

1580
01:57:58,839 --> 01:58:03,662
[SPEAKER_10]: You're really repackaging the same shit and putting it out there, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

1581
01:58:03,842 --> 01:58:06,985
[SPEAKER_10]: This thing's going to end up under a lot of little Timmy Christmas trees.

1582
01:58:07,485 --> 01:58:35,110
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's just you know and if you think about it if you're like looking for a really cheap guitar game like you just want something to play I mean you literally can go out there and buy used I saw used rock band guitars for like 12 bucks and then this game for like 20 or like 30 bucks there you go you know for less than 50 bucks you can have like a guitar hero type of thing that's a nice way of getting around it I like the way you think

1583
01:58:36,398 --> 01:58:39,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still using my Guitar Hero 2 controller.

1584
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:39,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

1585
01:59:00,157 --> 01:59:02,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know that Top 500 Bands?

1586
01:59:02,919 --> 01:59:05,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's with the old Guitar Hero 2 controller.

1587
01:59:05,342 --> 01:59:12,529
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was thinking about getting Guitar Hero World Tour, the little guitar and game bundle, but now I'm not so sure.

1588
01:59:12,609 --> 01:59:16,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll just, because the Guitar Hero Aerosmith got a price reduction because of World Tour.

1589
01:59:16,473 --> 01:59:17,514
[SPEAKER_10]: I might just go back and pick that up.

1590
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:18,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Freaks Drum Mania

1591
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:38,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course the subtitle on this is Blazing!

1592
01:59:39,273 --> 01:59:40,954
[SPEAKER_09]: With four exclamation points.

1593
01:59:40,994 --> 01:59:42,055
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so awesome.

1594
01:59:42,735 --> 01:59:46,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems to be fire themed, so that's kind of cool.

1595
01:59:47,158 --> 01:59:57,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And no word exactly on what songs are in it, but so far they said that the expected song count, if you can believe it or not, 570 plus songs.

1596
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:03,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess in all.

1597
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:06,313
[SPEAKER_09]: That's freaking crazy.

1598
02:00:07,994 --> 02:00:09,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Over 570 songs.

1599
02:00:10,275 --> 02:00:12,476
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like almost every single song that's been in Guitar Freaks.

1600
02:00:12,776 --> 02:00:13,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be.

1601
02:00:13,457 --> 02:00:14,638
[SPEAKER_09]: My god, that's huge.

1602
02:00:14,658 --> 02:00:17,219
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you scroll through that damn list?

1603
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:18,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1604
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:21,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Location testing soon, I guess.

1605
02:00:22,022 --> 02:00:30,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And supposedly, I don't know, it's the 16th installment for Drum Mania, 17th for Guitar Freaks.

1606
02:00:32,094 --> 02:00:32,854
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nuts.

1607
02:00:33,134 --> 02:00:33,554
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a lot.

1608
02:00:33,855 --> 02:00:34,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1609
02:00:35,055 --> 02:00:42,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Guitar Hero will be catching up to that number in a couple years with the amount of tracks that they're talking about putting out.

1610
02:00:42,897 --> 02:00:56,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, the chat room is finally calming down from our little political talk earlier, which by the way, I just wanted to say quickly, sorry to kind of go back to it, but I just wanted to say, I don't blame any one group or any one thing for what happened.

1611
02:00:56,621 --> 02:01:00,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, to go back to what I said, I blame

1612
02:01:01,681 --> 02:01:08,028
[SPEAKER_10]: and society's lack of knowledge for the whole thing.

1613
02:01:08,649 --> 02:01:18,420
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I were to target one whole group or one whole cluster of people for what happened, that would be no better than them targeting me.

1614
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,902
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyhow, just kind of wondering, because that's responding to a lot of things I'm seeing in chat.

1615
02:01:23,922 --> 02:01:25,062
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just kind of what I wanted to say.

1616
02:01:26,023 --> 02:01:30,985
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I want to say regarding games, SSJ100Matt says, the Microsoft Employee Store has Gears of War 2 for $25.

1617
02:01:32,386 --> 02:01:34,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, but employee stores always have games dirt cheap.

1618
02:01:34,727 --> 02:01:34,987
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact...

1619
02:01:36,574 --> 02:01:38,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to get some hookups from EA thanks to that.

1620
02:01:38,955 --> 02:01:42,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have a copy of Boom Blox I barely touched.

1621
02:01:42,536 --> 02:01:43,996
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a little different than the employee store.

1622
02:01:44,016 --> 02:01:48,978
[SPEAKER_09]: This is their training site where you take tests and you earn points and you use those points to buy games.

1623
02:01:49,338 --> 02:01:51,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get games for the $3.60 on the first party except for $9.

1624
02:01:52,839 --> 02:01:55,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically $9 is the shipping on it.

1625
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:58,961
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're revamping it.

1626
02:01:58,981 --> 02:02:01,422
[SPEAKER_09]: They're redoing it because I don't know.

1627
02:02:01,442 --> 02:02:02,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it needs it.

1628
02:02:03,166 --> 02:02:06,609
[SPEAKER_10]: and SonicM88 says the Explorer is still the best, Rob.

1629
02:02:06,989 --> 02:02:10,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And Actdeft says Explorer, then the Stratocaster for Rock Band 2, then the rest.

1630
02:02:10,712 --> 02:02:16,437
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe the Explorer really is the best, but my yellow thing is sticking, which sucks.

1631
02:02:17,818 --> 02:02:18,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Controller surgery!

1632
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,763
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously, $8 will buy you a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

1633
02:02:22,783 --> 02:02:23,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1634
02:02:23,203 --> 02:02:25,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll just get a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

1635
02:02:26,245 --> 02:02:30,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, just take a trip to one of your game stores that sells you stuff.

1636
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:31,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

1637
02:02:32,342 --> 02:02:38,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I forgot to, you know, this is like totally skipped this, but I forgot to mention that... We're all over the place today.

1638
02:02:38,508 --> 02:02:39,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's cool.

1639
02:02:39,349 --> 02:02:41,370
[SPEAKER_09]: In my game week, I actually played DDR this week.

1640
02:02:41,871 --> 02:02:42,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1641
02:02:42,612 --> 02:02:46,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Supernova at that one game store I was telling you about.

1642
02:02:47,116 --> 02:02:48,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I gotta go check that out.

1643
02:02:48,537 --> 02:02:50,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't exercise still for another week and a half.

1644
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:54,481
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another reason I didn't go out today, just because of the timing of what was going on today.

1645
02:02:54,521 --> 02:02:59,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I still can't be packed in with people because I'm still really sensitive in some areas.

1646
02:03:00,225 --> 02:03:03,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't do a lot of physical activity, walking for long distances and things.

1647
02:03:04,188 --> 02:03:07,670
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun, but I'm totally out of shape.

1648
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:08,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Supernova is fun.

1649
02:03:37,569 --> 02:03:38,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan Lee Riches

1650
02:04:00,902 --> 02:04:04,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, he sued Blizzard over World of Warcraft.

1651
02:04:05,223 --> 02:04:07,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's his beef with World of Warcraft?

1652
02:04:07,444 --> 02:04:17,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it has caused him to live in a virtual universe where he committed identity theft and fought cyber monster gangs.

1653
02:04:19,327 --> 02:04:23,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was addicted to video games and lost touch with reality because of Blizzard.

1654
02:04:24,429 --> 02:04:29,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So in other words, here's somebody saying, it's Blizzard's fault...

1655
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,882
[SPEAKER_10]: That I can't separate game from reality.

1656
02:04:33,663 --> 02:04:33,983
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1657
02:04:35,765 --> 02:04:38,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's called, um, he's stupid.

1658
02:04:39,449 --> 02:04:43,193
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no such thing as video game addiction.

1659
02:04:44,113 --> 02:04:49,098
[SPEAKER_04]: There are addictive personalities that happen to play video games.

1660
02:04:49,459 --> 02:04:51,200
[SPEAKER_04]: There are OCD people out there.

1661
02:04:52,001 --> 02:04:53,643
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy is just stupid.

1662
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:59,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the fact that he kind of sues a lot of people just kind of, you know, dumbs down the whole thing.

1663
02:05:00,053 --> 02:05:06,316
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's crazy to think that there are people out there that rationalize this like his lawyer.

1664
02:05:06,776 --> 02:05:10,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Or better yet, why are we letting, yeah, exactly, why are we letting inmates sue?

1665
02:05:10,958 --> 02:05:14,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we letting these inmates, like, sue everybody?

1666
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,760
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just retarded.

1667
02:05:17,121 --> 02:05:18,622
[SPEAKER_09]: What else are you going to do when you're in prison?

1668
02:05:18,922 --> 02:05:21,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear they need to do some sort of federal lawsuit act.

1669
02:05:23,027 --> 02:05:25,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, you know, we don't have the shit.

1670
02:05:27,048 --> 02:05:28,049
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get three.

1671
02:05:28,689 --> 02:05:31,370
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says that we should take him to the Tyra Banks show.

1672
02:05:31,930 --> 02:05:32,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sure.

1673
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Tyra will solve everything.

1674
02:05:34,371 --> 02:05:35,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We should give him a stern talking to.

1675
02:05:36,152 --> 02:05:37,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We should let Oprah deal with him.

1676
02:05:37,492 --> 02:05:40,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to point out, it's a handwritten... Oh my god!

1677
02:05:40,874 --> 02:05:43,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually looking at the text.

1678
02:05:43,354 --> 02:05:47,616
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a handwritten testimony there.

1679
02:05:50,734 --> 02:05:56,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment asks can I sue Fanta for being awesome?

1680
02:05:57,790 --> 02:05:59,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, that's retarded.

1681
02:06:01,442 --> 02:06:04,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that it's handwritten, that's also retarded.

1682
02:06:04,124 --> 02:06:05,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, dude, get a typewriter.

1683
02:06:06,386 --> 02:06:06,606
[SPEAKER_09]: At least.

1684
02:06:06,626 --> 02:06:08,347
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't let you have typewriters in prison.

1685
02:06:08,467 --> 02:06:12,210
[SPEAKER_10]: This caused Rich's to commit fraud to buy Defendants video games.

1686
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:15,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Rich's chose World of Warcraft over working a legit job.

1687
02:06:15,672 --> 02:06:18,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Rich's mind became a living video game.

1688
02:06:18,294 --> 02:06:20,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I hold Defendants liable and support plaintiffs.

1689
02:06:21,476 --> 02:06:23,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is he referring to himself in the third person?

1690
02:06:24,258 --> 02:06:25,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's like a lawyer or something.

1691
02:06:25,979 --> 02:06:26,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1692
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:26,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway.

1693
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:28,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did the lawyer then handwrite all that?

1694
02:06:28,721 --> 02:06:29,362
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1695
02:06:30,879 --> 02:06:34,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, they gave Jack Thompson a license, so, you know.

1696
02:06:34,563 --> 02:06:40,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but eventually people got, you know, their brains straightened, you know, took away his license.

1697
02:06:41,130 --> 02:06:48,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, if you're any fan of Orange Lounge Radio and you've been listening for the past 300 some odd episodes, you know what segment's coming next.

1698
02:07:03,902 --> 02:07:05,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to interject one quick thing before we start.

1699
02:07:05,963 --> 02:07:08,123
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a comment from Marissa in chat.

1700
02:07:08,183 --> 02:07:09,884
[SPEAKER_10]: The lovely Marissa who hasn't been here for forever.

1701
02:07:10,704 --> 02:07:11,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Who needs to come back, by the way.

1702
02:07:12,245 --> 02:07:14,245
[SPEAKER_10]: You learn something new every day on Orange Launch Radio.

1703
02:07:14,525 --> 02:07:15,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa says, I work in law.

1704
02:07:15,946 --> 02:07:17,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen handwritten pleadings.

1705
02:07:17,306 --> 02:07:18,086
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so funny.

1706
02:07:18,246 --> 02:07:19,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently this is not uncommon.

1707
02:07:20,847 --> 02:07:21,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1708
02:07:21,587 --> 02:07:21,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1709
02:07:21,908 --> 02:07:22,548
[SPEAKER_10]: FU's of the week time.

1710
02:07:23,488 --> 02:07:26,329
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to everyone who voted yes on Prop 8.

1711
02:07:27,689 --> 02:07:28,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And Prop 2.

1712
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:32,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Prop 2 is stupid, first of all.

1713
02:07:33,945 --> 02:07:35,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I understand we love the animals!

1714
02:07:36,947 --> 02:07:51,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the majority to vote yes on Prop 2 and no on Prop... And, sorry, to vote in Prop 2 to give rights to chickens, and then not, you know, and then take away rights with Prop 8, it's just stupid.

1715
02:07:51,978 --> 02:07:58,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Also to the majority voters of Arkansas and Florida and anyone else with your head up your ass!

1716
02:08:00,994 --> 02:08:03,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you've got your nose turned up, because all you can smell is your own shit.

1717
02:08:04,076 --> 02:08:05,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And it don't smell good.

1718
02:08:07,379 --> 02:08:11,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I voted yes on prop 2 because I thought chickens that got the stand-up would taste better.

1719
02:08:13,643 --> 02:08:17,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Which actually is partially true, in a way.

1720
02:08:17,386 --> 02:08:17,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

1721
02:08:18,947 --> 02:08:21,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Chickens that get the space to breathe are going to taste better.

1722
02:08:21,609 --> 02:08:23,311
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what people are ignoring with this.

1723
02:08:23,391 --> 02:08:24,752
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, chickens are stupid.

1724
02:08:26,173 --> 02:08:27,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me finish by what I'm saying.

1725
02:08:28,134 --> 02:08:28,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Second of all...

1726
02:08:29,495 --> 02:08:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: For however many farms are going to have to put the money and time into getting up to these new standards, it's going to increase the cost of food that is already expensive.

1727
02:08:41,887 --> 02:08:47,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And for people who are, you know, especially with the job market being the way it is, for people losing their homes left and right,

1728
02:08:48,053 --> 02:08:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is going to be able to afford more money for food that's already hard to afford?

1729
02:08:52,097 --> 02:09:06,431
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already a problem going on across the country, and I can't believe people are so selfish that they want to ignore the simple financial impact this is going to have on everybody just for a few stupid chickens who don't care.

1730
02:09:06,691 --> 02:09:09,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, those are the eggs from outside of California.

1731
02:09:11,525 --> 02:09:12,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

1732
02:09:12,526 --> 02:09:13,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Get those Nevada chickens.

1733
02:09:13,727 --> 02:09:18,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a frivolous waste of money because people... Ugh.

1734
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame liberals.

1735
02:09:22,332 --> 02:09:24,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1736
02:09:25,294 --> 02:09:39,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to say a few of the people that voted yes on 8, but not necessarily... They had the whole, like, you know, they were following the polls and everything and they were showing... They were getting a response from someone that was part of the yes on 8 party or whatever.

1737
02:09:40,365 --> 02:09:40,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1738
02:09:40,965 --> 02:09:43,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It just sounded like a total Christian agenda or something.

1739
02:09:44,027 --> 02:09:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to actually add another F you then.

1740
02:09:46,588 --> 02:09:49,689
[SPEAKER_04]: To the Mormon Church, F you, I'm boycotting all your businesses.

1741
02:09:49,709 --> 02:09:55,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it just, you know, I'm so anti-religion, but that's alright, you know, so.

1742
02:09:56,477 --> 02:09:57,058
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to that, I guess.

1743
02:09:57,258 --> 02:10:05,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to the fact that there was another proposition that was passed that allows veterans to get even more money for housing.

1744
02:10:05,746 --> 02:10:15,595
[SPEAKER_09]: When, you know, people like me can't get any money for housing, and these people... It was funny, the proposition, they don't even have to actually serve in, like...

1745
02:10:16,889 --> 02:10:21,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's just supposed to be reparations for having to smell their, you know, drill sergeant's breath.

1746
02:10:21,553 --> 02:10:24,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, I'm not going to use the same FU.

1747
02:10:24,315 --> 02:10:28,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to say FU to intolerance.

1748
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:29,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really surprised to learn this week

1749
02:10:46,081 --> 02:10:53,144
[SPEAKER_10]: and all walks of life in all places in my life where there is still intolerance and we have a lot of work to do.

1750
02:10:55,224 --> 02:10:55,624
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1751
02:10:57,005 --> 02:10:57,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1752
02:10:57,905 --> 02:10:58,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

1753
02:10:58,546 --> 02:10:59,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming news.

1754
02:10:59,526 --> 02:11:00,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming deals.

1755
02:11:01,247 --> 02:11:02,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Games that are steel.

1756
02:11:03,547 --> 02:11:07,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about a game that is a blank slate?

1757
02:11:08,766 --> 02:11:09,126
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean?

1758
02:11:09,286 --> 02:11:09,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Tabula Rasa.

1759
02:11:10,347 --> 02:11:12,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm bum.

1760
02:11:12,827 --> 02:11:13,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1761
02:11:13,928 --> 02:11:15,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon's selling it for 96 cents.

1762
02:11:17,149 --> 02:11:17,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1763
02:11:17,689 --> 02:11:17,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1764
02:11:18,209 --> 02:11:20,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazon.com is selling Tabula Rasa for 96 cents.

1765
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:21,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I checked.

1766
02:11:21,671 --> 02:11:26,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you want to translate that into... Is that with free shipping?

1767
02:11:26,472 --> 02:11:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1768
02:11:27,373 --> 02:11:27,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

1769
02:11:28,193 --> 02:11:30,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It would translate to 61 pence, by the way.

1770
02:11:32,387 --> 02:11:34,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, they're trying to get rid of it.

1771
02:11:34,929 --> 02:11:56,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, NCSoft laid off a lot of people, but they're thinking that Tabula Rasa is going to be able to actually pull a future out of Hammer Space, I guess, with an expansion coming out for the game that's going to have a revamped first-person camera, scope and cockpit views, new weapons, rocket launchers!

1772
02:11:56,818 --> 02:12:00,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find all that out from the Tabula Rasa website.

1773
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:05,182
[SPEAKER_04]: But for right now, if you want to pick up it, pick up it, yeah.

1774
02:12:05,542 --> 02:12:07,463
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to pick it up, 96 cents.

1775
02:12:08,103 --> 02:12:11,544
[SPEAKER_04]: You pay more for shipping than you do for the damn game.

1776
02:12:11,764 --> 02:12:13,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually half-tempted.

1777
02:12:13,365 --> 02:12:15,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Tabula Rasa was not terrible.

1778
02:12:15,546 --> 02:12:18,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking about it, too.

1779
02:12:18,727 --> 02:12:21,248
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a month of play for five bucks.

1780
02:12:22,388 --> 02:12:22,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

1781
02:12:23,229 --> 02:12:24,169
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be worth a look.

1782
02:12:24,989 --> 02:12:25,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of curious.

1783
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly do think this is the tactic.

1784
02:12:28,331 --> 02:12:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1785
02:12:29,894 --> 02:12:32,456
[SPEAKER_10]: is a very interesting way to get people on board because that's what they'll make their money.

1786
02:12:32,476 --> 02:12:36,218
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to make their money off the sale of the game because the retailer gets screwed there.

1787
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:40,960
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to make their money off the subscription if I forget to cancel it or something, which I won't do.

1788
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,081
[SPEAKER_10]: If the game sucks, it sucks.

1789
02:12:42,901 --> 02:12:45,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not all that interested in actually playing it.

1790
02:12:45,083 --> 02:12:46,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking about buying it.

1791
02:12:46,683 --> 02:12:47,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to have.

1792
02:12:47,664 --> 02:12:49,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to go in the collection.

1793
02:12:49,085 --> 02:12:50,285
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a Lord British game.

1794
02:12:50,546 --> 02:12:52,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Or what do they call him now in Tabula Rasa?

1795
02:12:52,407 --> 02:12:53,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Commander British or whatever his name is.

1796
02:12:54,067 --> 02:12:54,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1797
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:56,481
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1798
02:13:13,050 --> 02:13:13,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1799
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:13,791
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1800
02:13:13,811 --> 02:13:14,851
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two words to say.

1801
02:13:14,951 --> 02:13:15,151
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1802
02:13:15,572 --> 02:13:16,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no!

1803
02:13:17,333 --> 02:13:19,013
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of sadly what I had to say.

1804
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:21,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, Wrath of the Lich King's coming out.

1805
02:13:21,975 --> 02:13:22,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1806
02:13:22,415 --> 02:13:22,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, life.

1807
02:13:23,016 --> 02:13:23,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1808
02:13:23,416 --> 02:13:23,596
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1809
02:13:23,756 --> 02:13:23,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1810
02:13:24,116 --> 02:13:25,357
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1811
02:13:25,557 --> 02:13:25,657
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1812
02:13:25,677 --> 02:13:27,598
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to come out at midnight for Wrath of the Lich King with me?

1813
02:13:28,859 --> 02:13:29,119
[SPEAKER_10]: When?

1814
02:13:29,859 --> 02:13:30,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Thursday?

1815
02:13:30,660 --> 02:13:31,160
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not going to.

1816
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably won't go by it at midnight.

1817
02:13:32,641 --> 02:13:35,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how crazy it's going to be on WoW that night?

1818
02:13:37,390 --> 02:13:39,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I... Everybody's EPing is going to make them go on there first.

1819
02:13:40,274 --> 02:13:41,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Ragnarok.

1820
02:13:41,815 --> 02:13:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

1821
02:13:42,456 --> 02:13:43,057
[SPEAKER_10]: You go, girl.

1822
02:13:43,237 --> 02:13:43,557
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1823
02:13:44,218 --> 02:13:44,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1824
02:13:44,919 --> 02:13:45,360
[SPEAKER_02]: You go.

1825
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:48,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep going.

1826
02:13:49,344 --> 02:13:49,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

1827
02:13:51,787 --> 02:13:57,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So there... You know, the DSi just was released and it's apparently, you know...

1828
02:13:59,252 --> 02:14:06,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Allowed now the R4 carts and any sort of homebrew slash hacking carts.

1829
02:14:06,934 --> 02:14:08,094
[SPEAKER_09]: It's prevented them from working.

1830
02:14:09,815 --> 02:14:14,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sure enough, it only took about a week, but the DSi has already been hacked.

1831
02:14:14,696 --> 02:14:27,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've already got... Yes, there is a YouTube video out there already showing one, I guess, developer, Yasusoft, created, of course, the typical Hello World...

1832
02:14:28,779 --> 02:14:42,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently it was done also with something that has been exploited on... I'd like to, for once, on this Hello World program, which, if you don't know, the Hello World program is to simply print Hello World on the screen.

1833
02:14:42,824 --> 02:14:47,025
[SPEAKER_10]: In Commodore Basic, that would be 10, print, quote, Hello World, end quote.

1834
02:14:48,264 --> 02:14:48,925
[SPEAKER_10]: 20, GoTo10.

1835
02:14:50,706 --> 02:14:53,148
[SPEAKER_10]: If you would put Hello Piracy in these programs.

1836
02:14:53,729 --> 02:14:54,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello Piracy!

1837
02:14:55,190 --> 02:15:10,062
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's supposedly done with some sort of modified TIFF image buffer overflow thing, which for people that know, the PSP was done the same way and seems to be something that's pretty typical.

1838
02:15:11,103 --> 02:15:11,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Surprise!

1839
02:15:12,764 --> 02:15:16,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you may have thwarted one thing, it won't stay thwarted for long.

1840
02:15:18,905 --> 02:15:22,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time I'm sure it comes out in the US, it will already be hacked wide open.

1841
02:15:22,687 --> 02:15:25,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially now with SD card support, man.

1842
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:27,871
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to make things even easier, because you know what that means?

1843
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:31,753
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of knew this was going to happen when they announced that SD card slot was going to be on there, right?

1844
02:15:31,773 --> 02:15:32,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine that, though?

1845
02:15:32,474 --> 02:15:38,057
[SPEAKER_09]: With SD card support, all you're really going to need to do is load a program, and then you're going to be able to modify the firmware just like you can with the PSP.

1846
02:15:38,097 --> 02:15:39,198
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't even need a cart.

1847
02:15:39,578 --> 02:15:41,079
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be even easier to hack open.

1848
02:15:41,219 --> 02:15:41,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo-hoo.

1849
02:15:43,761 --> 02:15:44,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty.

1850
02:15:44,882 --> 02:15:45,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

1851
02:15:46,877 --> 02:15:48,178
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1852
02:16:09,389 --> 02:16:14,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yaris is no longer on Xbox Live Arcade.

1853
02:16:14,835 --> 02:16:17,618
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, you can't even find it on Xbox.com now.

1854
02:16:21,073 --> 02:16:31,041
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting about this, I mean, it's completely gone, but the question is, is it something that they were purposely getting rid of for this whole delisting of games thing?

1855
02:16:31,722 --> 02:16:35,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Or this game did come out about one year ago exactly.

1856
02:16:36,426 --> 02:16:41,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it some type of contractual thing going on where it was a Toyota promotion?

1857
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:44,292
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically a game advertisement.

1858
02:16:44,692 --> 02:16:45,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the ad run out?

1859
02:16:46,313 --> 02:16:46,794
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably did.

1860
02:16:49,111 --> 02:16:53,058
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bobby Blackwolf swears up and down in our chat right now that's exactly what happened.

1861
02:16:55,582 --> 02:16:56,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wouldn't be surprised at all.

1862
02:16:58,888 --> 02:17:03,871
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just kind of funny because a lot of people are going, oh, the delisting demon's coming for you.

1863
02:17:05,072 --> 02:17:07,554
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was a big advertisement game.

1864
02:17:07,574 --> 02:17:09,455
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it probably sucked in the first place.

1865
02:17:10,536 --> 02:17:12,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Who puts that much effort into an ad game?

1866
02:17:12,977 --> 02:17:14,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I don't lose those achievements, though.

1867
02:17:14,658 --> 02:17:16,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Hero was cool.

1868
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:17,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Star Hero was kind of cool.

1869
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:18,921
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hope I don't lose those achievements.

1870
02:17:19,141 --> 02:17:19,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

1871
02:17:20,082 --> 02:17:20,402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

1872
02:17:20,902 --> 02:17:23,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It just will mean that they won't sell it anymore online.

1873
02:17:23,953 --> 02:17:25,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about something cool?

1874
02:17:25,473 --> 02:17:26,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, how about it?

1875
02:17:26,794 --> 02:17:30,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the developer Blue Castle is working on something.

1876
02:17:31,995 --> 02:17:32,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising 2?

1877
02:17:33,336 --> 02:17:33,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hey!

1878
02:17:34,216 --> 02:17:34,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1879
02:17:35,036 --> 02:17:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1880
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:45,699
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to be... Well, they haven't really confirmed anything, but it's been stated by a good source that they were working on it for Capcom.

1881
02:17:45,859 --> 02:17:47,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Insider info.

1882
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:47,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1883
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:51,601
[SPEAKER_04]: No details, no nothing else about it, and no one has confirmed anything.

1884
02:17:51,641 --> 02:17:51,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey!

1885
02:17:53,856 --> 02:17:58,400
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, is it any real surprise that we're getting a Dead Rising 2?

1886
02:17:58,880 --> 02:17:59,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, no.

1887
02:17:59,361 --> 02:18:00,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Zombies!

1888
02:18:00,682 --> 02:18:01,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1889
02:18:01,243 --> 02:18:01,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And malls.

1890
02:18:03,004 --> 02:18:05,006
[SPEAKER_12]: What if this one's somewhere different, not a mall, Rob?

1891
02:18:06,588 --> 02:18:07,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's true.

1892
02:18:07,148 --> 02:18:07,909
[SPEAKER_10]: It might not be a mall.

1893
02:18:08,549 --> 02:18:09,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how about an airport?

1894
02:18:10,691 --> 02:18:12,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you think the zombie outbreak's going to happen next?

1895
02:18:12,553 --> 02:18:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: An office building.

1896
02:18:14,595 --> 02:18:14,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1897
02:18:15,836 --> 02:18:16,657
[SPEAKER_10]: During the lunch hour.

1898
02:18:17,529 --> 02:18:18,690
[SPEAKER_10]: and Brains.

1899
02:18:20,091 --> 02:18:20,851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what's for lunch.

1900
02:18:22,092 --> 02:18:25,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Brains and that sandwich on the table back there.

1901
02:18:25,174 --> 02:18:26,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you need to play the song.

1902
02:18:27,115 --> 02:18:27,335
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1903
02:18:27,515 --> 02:18:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Jonathan Colton song.

1904
02:18:29,276 --> 02:18:29,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, later.

1905
02:18:29,856 --> 02:18:30,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have it right now.

1906
02:18:32,178 --> 02:18:35,039
[SPEAKER_10]: But Dead Rising 2 is... Loki, you were a big fan of Dead Rising 1.

1907
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:37,961
[SPEAKER_10]: What could be the best thing they could do for Dead Rising 2?

1908
02:18:38,041 --> 02:18:39,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Fix the saving.

1909
02:18:40,102 --> 02:18:41,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Fix the saving.

1910
02:18:41,743 --> 02:18:42,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Fix the saving.

1911
02:18:43,665 --> 02:18:44,185
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1912
02:18:46,112 --> 02:18:47,294
[SPEAKER_09]: and Rocket Launchers.

1913
02:18:47,976 --> 02:18:48,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Rocket Launchers.

1914
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:51,143
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Rocket Launchers Save Guns?

1915
02:18:52,714 --> 02:19:16,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Rocket Launcher Save Guns could be awesome another thing that could be awesome is some more more stuff that could be coming out and Hudson's got a new lineup of WiiWare games some sound ordinary one sounds really weird of course they just put out Alien Crush Returns which is really awesome um

1916
02:19:18,246 --> 02:19:24,785
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have announced three more WiiWare games that are coming to the Powell Wii Shop and are probably coming over here at some point as well.

1917
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:33,166
[SPEAKER_09]: First, they've got Snooker vs. Billiards Q Sports, which is a pool game.

1918
02:19:33,186 --> 02:19:35,988
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not QQ Sports when you lose.

1919
02:19:36,008 --> 02:19:36,528
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not QQ.

1920
02:19:37,089 --> 02:19:44,314
[SPEAKER_09]: It features online play for one of the four players and allows you to either do motion controller or button-based play.

1921
02:19:45,335 --> 02:19:53,322
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one is Snowboard Riot, which is a snowboarding game with combat, sort of like Road Rash down a mountain.

1922
02:19:53,522 --> 02:19:54,262
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds kind of cool.

1923
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:57,852
[SPEAKER_09]: The last game is called Pit Crew Panic.

1924
02:20:01,933 --> 02:20:02,373
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

1925
02:20:02,433 --> 02:20:13,516
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of like a racing game, but you play Pit Crew that fixes different things from fixing cakes to flower beds and even toilets.

1926
02:20:16,837 --> 02:20:18,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how exciting.

1927
02:20:20,178 --> 02:20:21,379
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you do on your Wii today?

1928
02:20:21,419 --> 02:20:22,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I fixed a toilet.

1929
02:20:23,547 --> 02:20:24,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome!

1930
02:20:24,248 --> 02:20:26,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You did what Wii with your toilet?

1931
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:32,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides the toilet fixing game and a hot dog eating game, and boy, we've got a lot of winning stuff on the Wii.

1932
02:20:34,636 --> 02:20:35,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Beer Pong?

1933
02:20:36,198 --> 02:20:36,938
[SPEAKER_10]: No, what is it?

1934
02:20:37,019 --> 02:20:38,200
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not Beer Pong.

1935
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,340
[SPEAKER_10]: They changed the name, remember?

1936
02:20:40,181 --> 02:20:42,303
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Pong Toss or something like that.

1937
02:20:42,343 --> 02:20:43,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't that what they called it?

1938
02:20:44,825 --> 02:20:47,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that, yeah.

1939
02:20:47,447 --> 02:20:47,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow...

1940
02:20:48,956 --> 02:20:49,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Burnout Paradise

1941
02:21:20,445 --> 02:21:22,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the creator of the DeLorean?

1942
02:21:22,306 --> 02:21:24,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, so that's what it is there.

1943
02:21:25,368 --> 02:21:26,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

1944
02:21:26,268 --> 02:21:28,049
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awesome that that's coming out.

1945
02:21:28,349 --> 02:21:29,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a McLaren clone in there?

1946
02:21:30,270 --> 02:21:36,854
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have cars called the Calvary Bootlegger, Manhattan Spirit, and GT Nighthawk.

1947
02:21:36,934 --> 02:21:49,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so what's awesome about the DeLorean one, or the not-so-DeLorean, is when you do the boost, it does make flame trails behind it, and if you push the L3 button, it will hover.

1948
02:21:51,264 --> 02:21:52,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at that in the screenshot.

1949
02:21:52,905 --> 02:21:54,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, it looks like this car is jumping.

1950
02:21:54,526 --> 02:21:55,346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bump and jump all of a sudden.

1951
02:21:55,366 --> 02:21:55,746
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hovering.

1952
02:21:55,766 --> 02:21:56,627
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

1953
02:21:56,647 --> 02:21:57,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It will go in the hover mode.

1954
02:21:57,807 --> 02:21:59,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what those other ones are?

1955
02:21:59,268 --> 02:22:02,029
[SPEAKER_09]: The bootlegger, that of course is the General Lee.

1956
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:09,633
[SPEAKER_09]: The other two that were in there, one is the Ecto-1, and the other one, Kit.

1957
02:22:10,493 --> 02:22:11,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet!

1958
02:22:11,694 --> 02:22:12,454
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they call it, Car?

1959
02:22:14,796 --> 02:22:17,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's what these other little names are.

1960
02:22:17,217 --> 02:22:18,197
[SPEAKER_10]: GT Nighthawk.

1961
02:22:18,557 --> 02:22:19,678
[SPEAKER_10]: GT Nighthawk, yeah.

1962
02:22:19,838 --> 02:22:20,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

1963
02:22:20,998 --> 02:22:22,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's pretty awesome.

1964
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:27,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And bless those folks at Criterion Games, because I think a lot of us kind of wrote off Burnout Paradise.

1965
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:29,961
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing a lot of free stuff, like add-ons and stuff.

1966
02:22:29,981 --> 02:22:35,403
[SPEAKER_10]: They are really letting us have our money's worth for this game, so good for them, even if some of us razzed the game.

1967
02:22:35,923 --> 02:22:37,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, they didn't make the show roll.

1968
02:22:37,143 --> 02:22:39,604
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a new party thing.

1969
02:22:39,644 --> 02:22:42,565
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Burnout Party or something like that that's coming out in February.

1970
02:22:42,906 --> 02:22:44,576
[SPEAKER_09]: February, I think.

1971
02:22:44,657 --> 02:22:45,522
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically...

1972
02:22:47,299 --> 02:22:50,201
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'm going to rebuy this game just for this download.

1973
02:22:50,241 --> 02:22:53,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really upset with myself that I traded away this game.

1974
02:22:53,463 --> 02:22:54,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I kept it.

1975
02:22:54,244 --> 02:22:55,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I still kept mine.

1976
02:22:55,064 --> 02:22:56,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure, but either way,

1977
02:23:17,919 --> 02:23:31,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebuy it if I have it And also if you're on the Playstation 3 You can just download it That's true, you can't always just download it On the Playstation 3, it's in their little store That's pretty cool Good for them, giving us our money's worth

1978
02:23:32,588 --> 02:23:48,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's something that's very interesting, speaking of money, more actually referring to economy, is that CCP is stating that there's new online content for the players where you'll be able to open your own bar, sort of.

1979
02:23:49,638 --> 02:24:10,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you basically will be able to, um, take empty space station areas and put in stores, put in shops, um, customize them however you want to, make your own rules, products, hire NPCs, custom dialogue, um, you can just hang out and sell stuff, create in-game currency, you know, that type of thing, so it sounds pretty cool.

1980
02:24:10,663 --> 02:24:11,743
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this, Quark the Game?

1981
02:24:15,795 --> 02:24:22,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll even be able to have a captain's quarters later on where you can take command of a ship.

1982
02:24:23,297 --> 02:24:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

1983
02:24:25,917 --> 02:24:29,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if these folks are getting a little worried about that Star Trek MMO that's looming.

1984
02:24:29,558 --> 02:24:30,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1985
02:24:31,959 --> 02:24:33,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Eve definitely has its following though.

1986
02:24:33,879 --> 02:24:38,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh come on, they're making a chess-like strategy board game with a hexagonal layout.

1987
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:42,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer the chess game.

1988
02:24:43,482 --> 02:24:45,044
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's kind of neat.

1989
02:24:45,064 --> 02:24:51,670
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, EVE's still expanding, and I hear it's a pretty difficult MMO, but a lot of folks really get rewards out of that.

1990
02:24:51,810 --> 02:24:52,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never played it myself.

1991
02:24:53,131 --> 02:24:56,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have time to play everything, but it definitely has its community.

1992
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:01,800
[SPEAKER_09]: So, speaking of...

1993
02:25:03,066 --> 02:25:04,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1994
02:25:21,338 --> 02:25:22,519
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1995
02:25:50,438 --> 02:25:51,378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awesome idea.

1996
02:25:51,418 --> 02:25:55,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take something that was available for free that came with the game and decide, oh, guess what?

1997
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,920
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to pay for it now.

1998
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:57,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1999
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:01,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not going to have any songs that are actually, you know, based on other things.

2000
02:26:01,581 --> 02:26:02,822
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just all original stuff.

2001
02:26:04,502 --> 02:26:05,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that'll fly.

2002
02:26:07,659 --> 02:26:13,543
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that you should know too is that they have plenty more Guitar Hero games coming out.

2003
02:26:13,923 --> 02:26:18,006
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, they said that Activision 09 lineup is 40% larger.

2004
02:26:18,386 --> 02:26:23,969
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, with that are multiple Call of Duty and multiple Guitar Hero releases.

2005
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:28,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those are their two biggest franchises, obviously.

2006
02:26:31,249 --> 02:26:31,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2007
02:26:32,329 --> 02:26:34,370
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to hear something else that's also interesting?

2008
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:40,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember NVIDIA when they purchased them and know how they got rid of Ghostbusters and all those other ones?

2009
02:26:41,351 --> 02:26:42,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why they got rid of them?

2010
02:26:43,432 --> 02:26:45,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they can't keep making sequels for them.

2011
02:26:45,812 --> 02:26:46,432
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why.

2012
02:26:46,712 --> 02:26:50,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they wanted games that they can make constant sequels for.

2013
02:26:50,573 --> 02:26:52,053
[SPEAKER_09]: They even came out and said that.

2014
02:26:52,414 --> 02:26:57,115
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they didn't pick up those original games because they only want games that they can make sequels for.

2015
02:26:57,255 --> 02:26:58,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Who said you can't make a sequel to Ghostbusters?

2016
02:26:59,515 --> 02:27:01,857
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been many Ghostbusters games.

2017
02:27:02,558 --> 02:27:03,438
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true.

2018
02:27:04,699 --> 02:27:07,822
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the old-ass one on the Commodore 64, Atari 2600.

2019
02:27:08,322 --> 02:27:10,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there was a later one based off of Ghostbusters 2.

2020
02:27:11,245 --> 02:27:13,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that game distinctly on the old PC.

2021
02:27:13,266 --> 02:27:14,087
[SPEAKER_10]: That was one of those 386SX games.

2022
02:27:14,107 --> 02:27:15,448
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't need them if they have the IP.

2023
02:27:25,421 --> 02:27:25,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

2024
02:27:25,962 --> 02:27:26,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2025
02:27:27,223 --> 02:27:28,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that would work.

2026
02:27:28,464 --> 02:27:30,046
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's why.

2027
02:27:30,347 --> 02:27:34,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're going to get a bunch of Call of Duty and a bunch of Guitar Hero.

2028
02:27:34,451 --> 02:27:38,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, there's that, you know, maybe a World War II and a modern and future one.

2029
02:27:38,916 --> 02:27:40,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this guitar...

2030
02:27:40,678 --> 02:27:41,198
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

2031
02:28:06,107 --> 02:28:13,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Downscale the videos or something like that for the PlayStation 2 and Wii or something I think they should do that I think Universe 3, that's out there in the wild now, isn't it?

2032
02:28:13,312 --> 02:28:30,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Universe 3 is out there on 360 So many games It's just, you know, they don't do it right, I don't think They basically give away the full song list They don't leave anything secret, so there's no, like, joy in unlocking stuff And it's just, you know, each title's kind of hokey in its own way

2033
02:28:33,128 --> 02:28:53,119
[SPEAKER_09]: but Guitar Hero is going to get the same way they're going to have each one for a different band I don't think they're going to be smart and actually have it where you can import them into say Guitar Hero World Tour I don't think they're going to do that I think Rock Band will because they've been doing that so far but I don't think it's going to happen with Guitar Hero I think they're going to make you buy a new game every time

2034
02:28:54,400 --> 02:29:03,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, look, if you're a music game fan looking for something new, I bet there's a few cult fans of this franchise that would try to push you towards DJ Max on the PSP.

2035
02:29:04,144 --> 02:29:11,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many of you guys have actually had your hands on this, because until now you've had to import this game, but there is a version of this game that is slated for US release.

2036
02:29:11,206 --> 02:29:12,687
[SPEAKER_10]: It's DJ Max Fever.

2037
02:29:13,387 --> 02:29:18,169
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Max Fever, now, it was going to come out in November, but sadly, the game got delayed.

2038
02:29:18,729 --> 02:29:19,730
[SPEAKER_10]: It is delayed a couple months.

2039
02:29:19,870 --> 02:29:22,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now going to come out probably January-ish is what they're looking at, but...

2040
02:29:23,271 --> 02:29:23,811
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

2041
02:29:48,226 --> 02:29:49,487
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Maxx Fever DJ Maxx Technica

2042
02:30:08,445 --> 02:30:11,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the interesting thing about the game, though, and how it's different from Beatmania.

2043
02:30:11,466 --> 02:30:12,866
[SPEAKER_10]: It uses a touch screen.

2044
02:30:13,206 --> 02:30:18,948
[SPEAKER_10]: You actually touch the screen to hit the notes as the notes go across the line, which is way different than the way this thing plays on the PSP.

2045
02:30:19,488 --> 02:30:23,149
[SPEAKER_10]: But you still can expect all the same musicians that you see from DJ Max.

2046
02:30:23,209 --> 02:30:25,270
[SPEAKER_10]: After all, half of the charm of these games is the music.

2047
02:30:25,410 --> 02:30:30,071
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this game almost reminds me that it's almost like they're trying to compete with Juby on this.

2048
02:30:30,851 --> 02:30:32,012
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of interesting.

2049
02:30:32,293 --> 02:30:32,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It is very interesting.

2050
02:30:33,193 --> 02:30:36,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, PM Studios is the folks that are bringing it to you in the U.S.

2051
02:30:36,617 --> 02:30:44,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting because between this, Street Fighter 4, Tekken 6, arcades are slowly getting a little love again.

2052
02:30:44,625 --> 02:30:47,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just see if this trend continues because I do miss arcades.

2053
02:30:47,487 --> 02:30:49,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to point out some of the cool features about this.

2054
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:53,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Technica is going to plug into the internet for global lead

2055
02:30:53,513 --> 02:31:01,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Leaderboards, internet updates to the game, which I think is very cool, because that means you can get new songs right on the internet, and little cards that are actually going to track the player progress.

2056
02:31:02,381 --> 02:31:08,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe there's some type of DJ Max soundtrack that you can get that comes with one of these cards, so you can get started.

2057
02:31:09,427 --> 02:31:09,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

2058
02:31:09,607 --> 02:31:09,967
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

2059
02:31:10,247 --> 02:31:14,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, and GS68 wants to correct you, it's Ubeat, not Ubeat.

2060
02:31:14,451 --> 02:31:15,031
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I said.

2061
02:31:15,051 --> 02:31:15,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I said Ubeat.

2062
02:31:15,452 --> 02:31:16,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I corrected myself.

2063
02:31:16,312 --> 02:31:16,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there you go.

2064
02:31:18,775 --> 02:31:19,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I remembered.

2065
02:31:21,018 --> 02:31:21,438
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2066
02:31:21,578 --> 02:31:25,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently some test locations for DJ Max Technica are going to be released soon.

2067
02:31:25,582 --> 02:31:35,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So some folks that have kind of been playing this game on a more like cult, unknown level, this game might explode in the next year, in 2009.

2068
02:31:35,410 --> 02:31:36,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it might not.

2069
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:36,550
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

2070
02:31:37,111 --> 02:31:38,172
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

2071
02:31:38,432 --> 02:31:40,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of interested how the touchscreen thing plays.

2072
02:31:40,994 --> 02:31:48,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I would worry that after hours and hours and hours of use and little kids with sticky hands in a place like Golfland, that that touchscreen's going to turn to shit.

2073
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:48,800
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

2074
02:31:50,605 --> 02:31:51,566
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds cool.

2075
02:31:52,887 --> 02:31:54,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like it might work.

2076
02:31:55,368 --> 02:31:55,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2077
02:31:56,088 --> 02:32:02,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, those of you guys that were listening to the program tonight were probably thinking towards the end of Part A, hey, where's DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week?

2078
02:32:03,393 --> 02:32:05,974
[SPEAKER_10]: We tune in every week to hear DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.

2079
02:32:05,994 --> 02:32:10,617
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't hear it tonight during Part A. Well, that's because DarkSakura got here a little earlier than anticipated.

2080
02:32:10,677 --> 02:32:13,719
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't schedule her to do the Classic Game of the Week until right now.

2081
02:32:16,297 --> 02:32:25,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So get ready to experience a game from gaming history as DarkSakura goes through her archives and picks a game that you all should be playing right now.

2082
02:32:26,085 --> 02:32:26,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

2083
02:32:27,447 --> 02:32:34,092
[SPEAKER_04]: The game of the week is Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

2084
02:32:35,674 --> 02:32:37,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, um... What a choice.

2085
02:32:38,036 --> 02:32:40,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because it's a freaking rad game.

2086
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:43,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the intro to it, okay?

2087
02:32:45,089 --> 02:32:52,315
[SPEAKER_04]: But I picked this particular clip so that we could get to the cornball American voice actor.

2088
02:32:52,975 --> 02:33:00,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is actually the direct sequel to Dracula X, which is my favorite Castlevania game.

2089
02:33:01,722 --> 02:33:11,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you start off the game actually finishing the end of Dracula X, you're playing as Richter, and then you go through the game playing as Alucard trying to hunt down Richter, who has gone into the castle and vanished.

2090
02:33:13,972 --> 02:33:24,782
[SPEAKER_04]: The interesting thing about this game is that it actually took a very Metroid-like quality to it where you have different areas that you're exploring and you have to move through the different areas.

2091
02:33:24,802 --> 02:33:26,764
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear different weapons on the way.

2092
02:33:29,367 --> 02:33:40,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, it's just a lot of... This game is just completely unique as far as bringing something into the Castlevania world when it first showed up.

2093
02:33:41,682 --> 02:33:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also had various other releases.

2094
02:33:44,605 --> 02:33:46,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the Saturn version, which is actually...

2095
02:33:47,856 --> 02:33:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Graphically, not my favorite because the Saturn didn't have a 3D as well.

2096
02:33:52,699 --> 02:33:55,540
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play as Maria, and that was freaking cool.

2097
02:33:55,560 --> 02:34:01,343
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also, of course, if you put in your name as Richter on the game, you can play as Richter, which is really cool.

2098
02:34:01,363 --> 02:34:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his own...

2099
02:34:03,844 --> 02:34:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: His own attacks and everything.

2100
02:34:08,648 --> 02:34:24,581
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, through the game you have sort of an RPG element to the game where you've got your familiars with you, you have... I love the sword familiars, sword familiars are my favorite.

2101
02:34:25,261 --> 02:34:30,242
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've also got, you know, interactions between characters that go in.

2102
02:34:30,582 --> 02:34:35,243
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even choose your path through the game, and it determines the kind of ending you'll receive.

2103
02:34:35,923 --> 02:34:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sure we all know what the bad ending is.

2104
02:34:38,184 --> 02:34:41,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, oh my god, the art in it was gorgeous.

2105
02:34:41,225 --> 02:34:43,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done by... Wait, wait, here comes the best part.

2106
02:34:44,005 --> 02:34:44,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2107
02:34:44,685 --> 02:34:45,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Die, monster.

2108
02:34:46,306 --> 02:34:47,866
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't belong in this world.

2109
02:34:49,192 --> 02:34:53,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh.

2110
02:34:53,994 --> 02:34:59,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I was called here by humans who wished to pay me tribute.

2111
02:35:00,257 --> 02:35:00,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Tribute?

2112
02:35:01,678 --> 02:35:05,299
[SPEAKER_05]: You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

2113
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:09,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

2114
02:35:10,822 --> 02:35:13,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Your words are as empty as your soul.

2115
02:35:14,183 --> 02:35:17,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

2116
02:35:18,669 --> 02:35:19,871
[SPEAKER_06]: What is a man?

2117
02:35:20,733 --> 02:35:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

2118
02:35:23,137 --> 02:35:24,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking love the dramatic wine glass toss.

2119
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:25,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Have at you!

2120
02:35:28,928 --> 02:35:31,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just as cornball in Japanese, just to let you know.

2121
02:35:31,769 --> 02:35:33,509
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the best gaming moments ever.

2122
02:35:34,149 --> 02:35:36,970
[SPEAKER_04]: This person, though, it's painful to watch this particular person playing because they wait.

2123
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:40,691
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're fighting Dracula, the first time around is Richter.

2124
02:35:41,231 --> 02:35:49,132
[SPEAKER_04]: If you let yourself, like, die, then Maria comes out and says, All my little animal buddies, help Richter not suck!

2125
02:35:49,753 --> 02:35:50,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that.

2126
02:35:51,753 --> 02:35:53,433
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never needed her help.

2127
02:35:53,753 --> 02:35:55,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

2128
02:35:57,661 --> 02:36:04,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there, um, with the development of this game, actually, there's a lot of really cool, cool stuff.

2129
02:36:05,030 --> 02:36:16,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it actually, there's a thing that, uh, was called, um, Castlevania the Bloodletting, um, which was a 32X game that was supposed to be in, um, um, in development.

2130
02:36:17,203 --> 02:36:17,844
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

2131
02:36:19,265 --> 02:36:26,929
[SPEAKER_04]: The art design in the game was done by Ayami Kojima, doing a lot of the concept art and designs for the games.

2132
02:36:27,710 --> 02:36:29,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very pretty, pretty artwork.

2133
02:36:31,752 --> 02:36:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the game is 2D, but you've got some rotational and 3D effects in the background.

2134
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2135
02:36:43,109 --> 02:36:45,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to up the volume just so you'd hear that part.

2136
02:36:45,691 --> 02:36:54,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are certain things that are rendered in 3D, like the clouds in certain areas, parts of the clock tower.

2137
02:36:55,738 --> 02:37:00,721
[SPEAKER_04]: There's even some full motion video that goes through different areas.

2138
02:37:00,821 --> 02:37:01,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty cool.

2139
02:37:02,582 --> 02:37:15,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, however, actually, one thing that's noted on this is that they don't appear in the Xbox Live Arcade version, which, you know, we've covered this, it did recently come to Xbox Live Arcade, and if you haven't downloaded it by now, shame on you.

2140
02:37:18,957 --> 02:37:21,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you're a PlayStation owner, then just go get it there.

2141
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:25,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the greatest hits game, I mean, jeez.

2142
02:37:26,764 --> 02:37:32,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd say, honestly though, with all the other versions that have come out, and also there was the PSP version.

2143
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:36,472
[SPEAKER_04]: This also has the Dart Priest Shaft.

2144
02:37:39,176 --> 02:37:40,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is right up on the screen right now.

2145
02:37:41,337 --> 02:37:42,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I just think is the greatest thing.

2146
02:37:42,818 --> 02:37:45,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I know we're not a TV show.

2147
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the same Shaft who is in Rondo of Blood.

2148
02:37:58,028 --> 02:38:00,289
[SPEAKER_10]: This was just an epic game when it first came out on PlayStation.

2149
02:38:00,309 --> 02:38:06,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the only problem I have with this game now is that every DS game has been a copy of it.

2150
02:38:07,526 --> 02:38:08,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Metroidvania.

2151
02:38:08,427 --> 02:38:09,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroidvania.

2152
02:38:26,444 --> 02:38:29,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there are some particular differences.

2153
02:38:29,268 --> 02:38:39,963
[SPEAKER_04]: The original, the name for this, actually, I'll tell you what, my husband, this was before I was with him, he imported this game when it first came out.

2154
02:38:40,464 --> 02:38:41,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

2155
02:38:59,196 --> 02:39:00,838
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several differences.

2156
02:39:00,918 --> 02:39:04,582
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, in the Japanese version, it has two extra familiars.

2157
02:39:05,042 --> 02:39:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the sprite familiar and the nose devil familiar.

2158
02:39:08,466 --> 02:39:10,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the sprite is a palette swap.

2159
02:39:10,148 --> 02:39:13,912
[SPEAKER_04]: The nose devil basically is the demon one with the Tengu mask.

2160
02:39:14,753 --> 02:39:15,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not.

2161
02:39:17,659 --> 02:39:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the guy who did Alucard's voice acting does have a sexy voice.

2162
02:39:22,663 --> 02:39:30,188
[SPEAKER_04]: The game actually had an art book, a soundtrack, and a short manga that came with the Japanese version.

2163
02:39:31,048 --> 02:39:33,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you it's pretty sweet.

2164
02:39:33,550 --> 02:39:34,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually really, really cool.

2165
02:39:36,432 --> 02:39:42,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like just a little behind-the-scenes thing of Alucard waking up and going off and kicking ass.

2166
02:39:43,957 --> 02:39:44,937
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also...

2167
02:39:47,572 --> 02:39:51,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Different version of the last stage.

2168
02:39:51,813 --> 02:39:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, in the US version, you saw it was called Bloodlines when Richter's chapter started up.

2169
02:40:00,156 --> 02:40:04,238
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Japanese one, it was called Rondo of Blood, which was the end of Rondo of Blood.

2170
02:40:05,698 --> 02:40:11,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's something related to YouTube that shows towards the end of the game, boss fight.

2171
02:40:13,003 --> 02:40:16,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for the Saturn version, there's another reason why I like it.

2172
02:40:17,144 --> 02:40:18,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I love playing as Maria.

2173
02:40:19,025 --> 02:40:23,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Maria is just freaking hardcore awesome in that game.

2174
02:40:24,427 --> 02:40:26,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of her attacks are really hard to do.

2175
02:40:27,368 --> 02:40:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's different remixes that play.

2176
02:40:32,129 --> 02:40:38,114
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, of, uh, old Castlevania music, depending on if you play as Richter or Maria, and you get either Vampire Killer or Bloody Tears.

2177
02:40:38,455 --> 02:40:40,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are actually really good mixes of them, too.

2178
02:40:41,117 --> 02:40:45,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the load times are longer, the transparencies are not that fantastic.

2179
02:40:46,161 --> 02:40:47,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's not the game, sorry.

2180
02:40:47,422 --> 02:40:49,624
[SPEAKER_10]: This is somebody's speedrun I'm looking at.

2181
02:40:49,744 --> 02:40:50,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, sorry.

2182
02:40:50,505 --> 02:40:50,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

2183
02:40:54,728 --> 02:40:56,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has distorted sprites.

2184
02:40:58,190 --> 02:41:03,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, there was a lot that the Saturn could have done better, and they just didn't take advantage of it.

2185
02:41:03,893 --> 02:41:06,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very rushed.

2186
02:41:06,755 --> 02:41:12,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But it did have two extra levels in the game, one of them... And this is me being a nerd, okay?

2187
02:41:14,659 --> 02:41:24,844
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who has ever done this, when you're in the first level, you'll find a trap door that closes when you come through the main drawbridge door, right?

2188
02:41:25,644 --> 02:41:29,606
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a way to sort of trick it into letting you go through the trap door.

2189
02:41:30,246 --> 02:41:35,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a series of, it's just like going into a cave, and then you go into another room down there.

2190
02:41:36,709 --> 02:41:38,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the PlayStation 1, it's just a save room.

2191
02:41:38,930 --> 02:41:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

2192
02:41:40,251 --> 02:41:41,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

2193
02:41:41,873 --> 02:41:42,493
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

2194
02:41:55,946 --> 02:42:06,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is true or not, but I think that the Saturn version was things that they had wanted to put in the original release and didn't.

2195
02:42:06,642 --> 02:42:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of the areas there, you can see where it would have fit to begin with.

2196
02:42:12,250 --> 02:42:17,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they clearly had to have had an intention to put something there if there was that little, you know, area.

2197
02:42:17,352 --> 02:42:19,152
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also another trick, though.

2198
02:42:19,632 --> 02:42:21,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been able to get it to work in the Saturn version.

2199
02:42:21,693 --> 02:42:36,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it works in the PlayStation version where you can do, like, some little glitch as the wolf and then the bat and then fly outside of the castle and fill in more area, which is really useful if you have the walk armor because the walk armor, the more you've explored the castle, the better defense you have.

2200
02:42:37,498 --> 02:42:38,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot about this game.

2201
02:42:38,839 --> 02:42:44,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I also know that it's a pain in the ass trying to get the Yatsusuna, but that is the best weapon in the game, in my opinion.

2202
02:42:46,206 --> 02:42:48,549
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a freaking awesome game and everyone should be playing it.

2203
02:42:48,869 --> 02:42:56,496
[SPEAKER_04]: It was voted, in 1998, it was the game of the year by EGM and ranked number four in their top 100 list of games since.

2204
02:42:56,696 --> 02:42:59,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Which was a bit controversial that year because it was the same year that Final Fantasy VII came out.

2205
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:01,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is better than Final Fantasy 7.

2206
02:43:03,424 --> 02:43:07,289
[SPEAKER_04]: This game got more play from me than Final Fantasy 7 did.

2207
02:43:08,751 --> 02:43:09,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2208
02:43:09,712 --> 02:43:13,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I played this game for hours of time.

2209
02:43:13,197 --> 02:43:14,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too, I love this game.

2210
02:43:14,859 --> 02:43:15,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

2211
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bother getting your walk armor?

2212
02:43:17,921 --> 02:43:18,882
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't.

2213
02:43:19,182 --> 02:43:23,905
[SPEAKER_10]: This came out during that period where I wasn't hardcore into games because I was in school.

2214
02:43:24,966 --> 02:43:26,988
[SPEAKER_10]: But I still played a lot of this game.

2215
02:43:27,288 --> 02:43:28,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to just sit down and play through it.

2216
02:43:29,109 --> 02:43:30,870
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be fun.

2217
02:43:30,890 --> 02:43:33,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an all-day thing, but you can get through most of the game in one day.

2218
02:43:33,873 --> 02:43:35,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at some guy doing a speed run.

2219
02:43:36,363 --> 02:43:43,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Speedruns for Symphony of the Night are freaking easy.

2220
02:43:43,911 --> 02:43:46,513
[SPEAKER_04]: They are easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

2221
02:43:46,874 --> 02:43:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you really want to beat the game quickly, you just run through there, whack Richter, and you're done.

2222
02:43:52,682 --> 02:44:01,245
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you want the good ending, you have to go find Shaft, call him a big dumbass with a skullcap, and then go beat Richter.

2223
02:44:01,925 --> 02:44:02,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2224
02:44:02,645 --> 02:44:04,966
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that earns the whatever reward.

2225
02:44:05,066 --> 02:44:19,970
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I just want to say also, the great thing about this game, speaking of the alternate ways you can do things, what a surprise when you kind of might think you're done with the game, but then you find out, wow, I'm really not done with this game.

2226
02:44:20,382 --> 02:44:22,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it really was such a surprise.

2227
02:44:22,323 --> 02:44:23,023
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.

2228
02:44:23,224 --> 02:44:23,844
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awesome.

2229
02:44:24,184 --> 02:44:32,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to give too much away for those that actually haven't seen it, which I would hope is not that many people at this point, but if you've never seen it, it's like one of those moments where you're like, ah, god damn.

2230
02:44:32,849 --> 02:44:37,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more, this is a game that really does just transcend.

2231
02:44:37,791 --> 02:44:39,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it really is fantastic.

2232
02:44:44,115 --> 02:44:48,177
[SPEAKER_04]: There's stuff about this game that I have still just found out.

2233
02:44:50,273 --> 02:44:53,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I uncovered quite a bit of this myself.

2234
02:44:53,795 --> 02:45:03,058
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a really fun trick where if you go in the library and you do your double jump in one particular place, you can actually pop up under the librarian and knock him into the ceiling.

2235
02:45:03,739 --> 02:45:03,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

2236
02:45:04,099 --> 02:45:06,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And he raises his hands in the air like he's going, Whee!

2237
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:09,161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, you can!

2238
02:45:09,501 --> 02:45:10,161
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

2239
02:45:10,601 --> 02:45:12,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see that.

2240
02:45:12,263 --> 02:45:14,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the little chats with Maria.

2241
02:45:14,566 --> 02:45:19,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And Maria's kind of... And she says Richter.

2242
02:45:20,012 --> 02:45:22,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Like she's going to spit acid in your eye.

2243
02:45:22,895 --> 02:45:23,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2244
02:45:23,476 --> 02:45:23,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

2245
02:45:25,278 --> 02:45:26,639
[SPEAKER_10]: What a wonderful game for the week.

2246
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:28,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

2247
02:45:28,241 --> 02:45:31,184
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't checked it out, it's so easy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

2248
02:45:32,165 --> 02:45:42,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Unlike some of these other super rare Japanese games that DarkSakura brings up once in a while, like games that were never released here or never will be, Symphony of the Night, any idiot can find it.

2249
02:45:42,451 --> 02:45:43,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've got to go play it.

2250
02:45:44,872 --> 02:45:49,014
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's do a couple more stories, then we're going to do a brief Skypline segment tonight.

2251
02:45:49,034 --> 02:45:52,216
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been running a little long because of everything else we've been talking about, but we will get to Skypline.

2252
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:57,979
[SPEAKER_10]: We do want to take at least two calls and then probably wrap up because it's almost 9.30 here on the West Coast.

2253
02:45:58,019 --> 02:46:00,060
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to finish at a decent hour tonight.

2254
02:46:00,701 --> 02:46:00,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

2255
02:46:02,250 --> 02:46:02,593
[SPEAKER_09]: More news.

2256
02:46:05,069 --> 02:46:07,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's some pretty interesting stuff.

2257
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:11,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you know, I just made my costume, and yeah, that's cool.

2258
02:46:12,113 --> 02:46:21,900
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want to make some other costumes, Indie Mogul, they have a, I guess it's like a podcast or videocast that they do, that's Backyard FX.

2259
02:46:22,820 --> 02:46:31,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the segments that they just did was how to build your own Halo 3 armor, or your own Halo armor, I guess, for under $100.

2260
02:46:31,185 --> 02:46:31,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2261
02:46:32,786 --> 02:46:35,448
[SPEAKER_09]: and they actually have instructions on how to do it.

2262
02:46:35,548 --> 02:46:37,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done with paper.

2263
02:46:37,649 --> 02:46:46,993
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually kind of do a little bit of paper craft and then you also paint over it with some clear coat acrylic stuff and then build it up with fiberglass and whatnot.

2264
02:46:48,214 --> 02:46:51,217
[SPEAKER_09]: But it can come out looking really cool if you put the time and effort into it.

2265
02:46:51,717 --> 02:46:54,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And the videos are available online.

2266
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's pretty awesome.

2267
02:46:56,882 --> 02:47:00,525
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to check it out, visit IndyMogul.com.

2268
02:47:00,665 --> 02:47:04,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I-N-D-Y-M-O-G-U-L Alright.

2269
02:47:07,471 --> 02:47:14,156
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting because Halloween we had all the official Master Chief costumes, which granted were a lot cheaper because they were...

2270
02:47:15,544 --> 02:47:16,305
[SPEAKER_10]: They look like crap.

2271
02:47:16,365 --> 02:47:18,188
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like a hefty bag and helmet.

2272
02:47:18,769 --> 02:47:23,115
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, kind of interesting that you can do this whole little fancy thing for relatively inexpensive.

2273
02:47:23,155 --> 02:47:26,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and this isn't just for, you know, Halo either.

2274
02:47:26,219 --> 02:47:31,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can use this and apply it to any sort of armor or whatever cosplay stuff you want to...

2275
02:47:32,247 --> 02:47:32,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Use it for.

2276
02:47:55,595 --> 02:47:56,096
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2277
02:48:14,458 --> 02:48:21,346
[SPEAKER_10]: which is, you know, the government has done this out of concern for, you know, kind of money under the table, laundering, inflation, da-da-da-da-da.

2278
02:48:22,287 --> 02:48:23,508
[SPEAKER_10]: They have just taxed it.

2279
02:48:23,528 --> 02:48:24,269
[SPEAKER_10]: 20% is the tax.

2280
02:48:26,952 --> 02:48:28,333
[SPEAKER_10]: and this announcement just came out.

2281
02:48:28,393 --> 02:48:38,019
[SPEAKER_10]: It was distributed to local tax bureaus and it specifically will target those who buy virtual currency from gamers and surfers to sell it to others at a markup.

2282
02:48:38,379 --> 02:48:47,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Taxation officials are granted the right to determine the original price of the online virtual currency if the individual fails to provide proof of an original price.

2283
02:48:48,466 --> 02:48:49,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

2284
02:48:51,158 --> 02:48:56,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think we might be next here in America to tax this kind of stuff?

2285
02:48:56,439 --> 02:49:01,160
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try, but I don't know if there's much that they'll want to admit real money transfer.

2286
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:04,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes through these Chinese companies and foreign companies anyway.

2287
02:49:04,341 --> 02:49:09,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I think on some of these big companies they could do a sales tax, but I don't know.

2288
02:49:10,622 --> 02:49:12,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be very hard to police everything.

2289
02:49:13,583 --> 02:49:16,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's kind of interesting about this whole law, if you ask me.

2290
02:49:17,264 --> 02:49:17,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2291
02:49:18,106 --> 02:49:21,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2292
02:49:21,888 --> 02:49:23,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2293
02:49:24,030 --> 02:49:25,871
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go ahead and take a couple quick phone calls.

2294
02:49:28,032 --> 02:49:30,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute stories for us?

2295
02:49:31,701 --> 02:49:33,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just some small stuff real quick.

2296
02:49:34,342 --> 02:49:37,023
[SPEAKER_09]: One I was going to mention, I don't know if this is out here anywhere.

2297
02:49:37,924 --> 02:49:44,066
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a game that they showed off, I want to say it was at Tokyo Game Show, and it was teased in Famitsu Magazine.

2298
02:49:44,806 --> 02:49:49,548
[SPEAKER_09]: A Japanese role-playing game called X-Edge or Cross-Edge.

2299
02:49:49,888 --> 02:49:55,950
[SPEAKER_09]: You may remember such similar games as Namco X-Capcom or Namco Cross-Capcom.

2300
02:49:56,170 --> 02:49:56,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

2301
02:49:56,650 --> 02:49:56,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

2302
02:49:58,251 --> 02:49:59,332
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2303
02:50:21,996 --> 02:50:35,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Morgan, Felicia, Dimitri, R. Tonalico, Orica, Misha, Shirelia, Disgaea, Atona, Prina, Spectral Souls, Mew, Mana, Kimia, Lilia, Rose, Marie

2304
02:50:40,526 --> 02:50:41,506
[SPEAKER_09]: They have kitchen sink.

2305
02:50:41,806 --> 02:50:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: They have everything.

2306
02:50:43,447 --> 02:50:45,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to know what the best part about this is?

2307
02:50:45,587 --> 02:50:47,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out to the U.S.

2308
02:50:47,768 --> 02:50:48,768
[SPEAKER_09]: spring of next year.

2309
02:50:49,728 --> 02:50:50,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2310
02:50:50,248 --> 02:50:51,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I got a caller on hold.

2311
02:50:51,209 --> 02:50:51,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

2312
02:50:51,989 --> 02:50:53,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2313
02:50:53,169 --> 02:50:53,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2314
02:50:54,369 --> 02:50:55,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Solid Goomba.

2315
02:50:55,290 --> 02:50:56,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Solid Goomba.

2316
02:50:56,030 --> 02:50:56,890
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, my friend?

2317
02:50:57,750 --> 02:51:03,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of want to weigh in on the whole copyright banhammer on LittleBigPlanet.

2318
02:51:03,552 --> 02:51:04,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

2319
02:51:04,432 --> 02:51:04,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Speak away.

2320
02:51:06,692 --> 02:51:08,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played the game yet.

2321
02:51:09,333 --> 02:51:11,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I just bought a PlayStation 3, but I don't get it until tomorrow.

2322
02:51:12,755 --> 02:51:15,576
[SPEAKER_07]: But I kind of think that it's a little ridiculous.

2323
02:51:16,617 --> 02:51:24,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it as a homage to the original IP, like making the Super Mario level and that kind of stuff.

2324
02:51:24,321 --> 02:51:25,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's perfectly acceptable.

2325
02:51:26,362 --> 02:51:34,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if the companies are going to go after people trying to recreate levels and such, then they should also be going after deviant art users for making fan images.

2326
02:51:36,744 --> 02:51:42,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of understand where they're coming from in terms of... You mentioned the Dirty Harry video.

2327
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:51,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand that, but I think if it's something that they're creating within the confines of the... Oh, crap.

2328
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:53,361
[SPEAKER_07]: The confines of the game, yeah?

2329
02:51:53,381 --> 02:51:53,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2330
02:51:53,781 --> 02:51:53,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2331
02:51:55,197 --> 02:51:57,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's no reason that it should be taken off

2332
02:52:16,411 --> 02:52:28,543
[SPEAKER_10]: at the same time no one's making money off of it I guess that's true but it's brand recognition when they could have the resistance levels but then again as I understand it Sony has been pulling levels about the Playstation 3

2333
02:52:30,066 --> 02:52:42,949
[SPEAKER_10]: But these guys having an itchy trigger finger should not be that big of a surprise when you consider that these are the same guys that some would say overreacted over the whole lyrics in the one song.

2334
02:52:43,349 --> 02:52:45,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now, Loki's showing me, what's this?

2335
02:52:45,689 --> 02:52:46,529
[SPEAKER_10]: A Galaga level.

2336
02:52:46,689 --> 02:52:46,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2337
02:52:47,250 --> 02:52:48,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who made this one?

2338
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:49,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Same guy who did the Gradius level.

2339
02:52:49,350 --> 02:52:50,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it just come out or something?

2340
02:52:50,550 --> 02:52:51,870
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he's got a bunch of videos.

2341
02:52:51,891 --> 02:52:54,491
[SPEAKER_09]: He also did a Tetris level that's even better than the other one that they showed off.

2342
02:52:54,511 --> 02:52:55,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

2343
02:52:56,031 --> 02:52:56,731
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

2344
02:52:57,332 --> 02:52:58,992
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, his levels aren't disappearing.

2345
02:53:00,441 --> 02:53:01,441
[SPEAKER_09]: because they're in Japanese.

2346
02:53:01,902 --> 02:53:03,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And the company is a European company.

2347
02:53:03,562 --> 02:53:05,103
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably can't read what his level says.

2348
02:53:05,783 --> 02:53:09,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, a comment from chat room, and I apologize if I mispronounce this name.

2349
02:53:09,685 --> 02:53:10,785
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a new name I haven't seen before.

2350
02:53:10,885 --> 02:53:11,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Sanchez?

2351
02:53:11,806 --> 02:53:12,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunchees?

2352
02:53:12,626 --> 02:53:13,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunchees?

2353
02:53:13,506 --> 02:53:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I like cheese, so Sunchees.

2354
02:53:15,027 --> 02:53:17,128
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's two Zs.

2355
02:53:17,768 --> 02:53:20,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Two Zs, not two Es, so Sanchez, maybe.

2356
02:53:20,329 --> 02:53:22,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tired of playing Super Mario Bros.

2357
02:53:22,130 --> 02:53:23,270
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-1 again and again.

2358
02:53:25,151 --> 02:53:28,593
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like every game that you can create something in, we see Mario Bros.

2359
02:53:28,633 --> 02:53:28,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Level 1-1.

2360
02:53:30,216 --> 02:53:38,179
[SPEAKER_10]: but there is even though yeah I'm sick of playing it too there is that moment of hey cool when you first see it right?

2361
02:53:38,719 --> 02:53:39,079
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2362
02:53:40,319 --> 02:53:46,441
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you had this game or you're going to be getting this game soon enough Solid Goomba what kind of level are you going to make?

2363
02:53:46,501 --> 02:53:52,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to go and just make something original or are you going to just infringe the IP and hope you don't get caught?

2364
02:53:53,144 --> 02:53:54,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh I'm going to infringe.

2365
02:53:54,224 --> 02:53:56,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not creative enough to create my own stuff.

2366
02:53:57,125 --> 02:53:57,925
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2367
02:53:59,486 --> 02:53:59,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2368
02:54:00,323 --> 02:54:02,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you're going to be looking for on the PlayStation 3?

2369
02:54:02,465 --> 02:54:04,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you're just now picking one up.

2370
02:54:04,827 --> 02:54:06,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you're looking for besides LittleBigPlanet?

2371
02:54:07,209 --> 02:54:09,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably be picking up some stuff that's come out in the past.

2372
02:54:10,852 --> 02:54:13,334
[SPEAKER_07]: One more thought on the whole user-created content.

2373
02:54:14,155 --> 02:54:18,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering if it will ever match for the PC.

2374
02:54:18,318 --> 02:54:23,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the modding community on the PC and how open that is to everyone.

2375
02:54:23,443 --> 02:54:25,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think consoles will ever reach that point?

2376
02:54:25,965 --> 02:54:27,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we'll see it anytime soon?

2377
02:54:30,456 --> 02:54:33,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, they say the PlayStation 3 is just a computer after all.

2378
02:54:34,018 --> 02:54:36,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So who knows?

2379
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:39,501
[SPEAKER_10]: In a way, yes, I think so.

2380
02:54:40,482 --> 02:54:49,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny how these things have come full circle because I remember 10 years ago, the Commodore 64 was a computer and its big selling point.

2381
02:54:49,387 --> 02:54:54,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why the Commodore 64 outsold most other computer systems, you didn't have to have a monitor.

2382
02:54:54,069 --> 02:54:54,970
[SPEAKER_10]: You could hook it up to your TV.

2383
02:54:56,650 --> 02:55:02,852
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very interesting now that we've kind of come full circle now and we're blurring this line between computers and your televisions in your living room.

2384
02:55:05,232 --> 02:55:07,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a very open thought there, but there you have it.

2385
02:55:08,453 --> 02:55:10,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Solid Goomba, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the PlayStation 3.

2386
02:55:10,734 --> 02:55:12,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks, man.

2387
02:55:12,234 --> 02:55:12,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2388
02:55:12,755 --> 02:55:13,335
[SPEAKER_10]: You too, buddy.

2389
02:55:13,775 --> 02:55:14,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

2390
02:55:16,661 --> 02:55:27,128
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting, you know, so much joking and funny things at Sony's expense, but LittleBigPlanet's really starting to single-handedly in some ways turn around people's opinions.

2391
02:55:28,429 --> 02:55:29,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2392
02:55:31,151 --> 02:55:32,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

2393
02:55:32,192 --> 02:55:33,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind?

2394
02:55:36,355 --> 02:55:40,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that I got onto the new Xbox Experience preview.

2395
02:55:41,238 --> 02:55:43,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard you, lucky bastard.

2396
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:43,740
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it?

2397
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:44,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you enjoying it?

2398
02:55:45,859 --> 02:55:46,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

2399
02:55:47,820 --> 02:55:58,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a complete upgrade or a new experience like the title says of the Xbox.

2400
02:55:58,164 --> 02:56:01,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell us like three things that are awesome in it that you can't do now.

2401
02:56:04,346 --> 02:56:34,030
[SPEAKER_08]: basically the parties the photo and movie parties are pretty awesome I haven't tried it yet but I have seen other people do it and it's pretty good the interface it's totally revamped it's easier to use than the old one I have still to get accustomed to it but like I said it's pretty easy to use the whole interface huh

2402
02:56:35,168 --> 02:56:35,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2403
02:56:37,489 --> 02:56:42,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been able to try, I don't know if you do Netflix, because they wouldn't have that in your region, huh?

2404
02:56:42,712 --> 02:56:43,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have the Netflix thing?

2405
02:56:44,333 --> 02:56:45,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we don't have Netflix.

2406
02:56:45,754 --> 02:56:50,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck, we don't have even a video marketplace for that, so I cannot try that.

2407
02:56:50,897 --> 02:56:52,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But I heard it's pretty cool.

2408
02:56:54,159 --> 02:56:56,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine you spent a little time building an avatar.

2409
02:56:56,741 --> 02:56:58,642
[SPEAKER_10]: How comprehensive was the avatar system in it?

2410
02:56:59,528 --> 02:57:00,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty easy to use.

2411
02:57:01,008 --> 02:57:02,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty easy to create an avatar.

2412
02:57:02,929 --> 02:57:09,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Though, what I didn't like is the comparison to the Nintendo Miis.

2413
02:57:11,371 --> 02:57:18,573
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have a whole wide variety to create a personal avatar.

2414
02:57:19,113 --> 02:57:19,473
[SPEAKER_08]: You have

2415
02:57:23,615 --> 02:57:33,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Predefined or pre-made avatars, and you have to choose the most according to what you want to appear.

2416
02:57:35,482 --> 02:57:49,411
[SPEAKER_10]: So kind of like on the Nintendo Wii, it was really all about the face of the Mii, and you could really customize that, but because the Xbox avatars are more about the clothes and the accessories, then the faces are limited, is kind of the impression I'm getting.

2417
02:57:50,236 --> 02:57:51,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's kind of limited.

2418
02:57:51,397 --> 02:58:12,615
[SPEAKER_08]: You can change the face a little, like glasses, a hat, the hair even, and some stuff, but not like in the Wii, that you have more choices to...

2419
02:58:13,902 --> 02:58:20,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, quick question from SSJ100 Matt in chat, and I don't know if you'd have the answer to this, but do you know if they increased the friend list limit in it?

2420
02:58:21,643 --> 02:58:22,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they did.

2421
02:58:23,424 --> 02:58:24,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't know.

2422
02:58:25,364 --> 02:58:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to search that, but I think they haven't.

2423
02:58:29,845 --> 02:58:31,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they have either, based on what I heard.

2424
02:58:31,825 --> 02:58:32,565
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was just curious.

2425
02:58:32,725 --> 02:58:35,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's on that list of half the things that got cut.

2426
02:58:35,846 --> 02:58:36,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2427
02:58:37,206 --> 02:58:42,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, ActDeft, anything else you want to say about the sneak peek you're getting at the experience?

2428
02:58:43,376 --> 02:58:45,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's pretty good, like I said.

2429
02:58:45,899 --> 02:58:54,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we Mexicans, we could get the Netflix and all the media marketplace things, because that would be pretty awesome.

2430
02:58:54,890 --> 02:58:58,234
[SPEAKER_08]: But from what I have seen and what I have...

2431
02:59:01,064 --> 02:59:18,583
[SPEAKER_10]: well, play with it's pretty good it's a whole new experience for the Xbox alright, well we'll be pulling for you and hope those features come to Mexico even though, I don't know, I don't think Netflix does business in Mexico, but at least something equivalent I don't know, so be nice I hope so alright, well Actdeft, have a good one buddy

2432
02:59:19,821 --> 02:59:28,544
[SPEAKER_10]: and have fun playing that experience I can't have right now because I was too slow to fill out that form before they closed it off because I have surgery.

2433
02:59:28,965 --> 02:59:30,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo hoo, QQ, cry cry.

2434
02:59:31,145 --> 02:59:32,686
[SPEAKER_10]: One more call.

2435
02:59:32,746 --> 02:59:34,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I said two, but I'm feeling nice.

2436
02:59:35,687 --> 02:59:39,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Do one more call.

2437
02:59:39,609 --> 02:59:43,070
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2438
02:59:43,490 --> 02:59:45,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any other quick last minute stories for us, Loki?

2439
02:59:46,482 --> 02:59:47,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's one that was sent in to me.

2440
02:59:48,544 --> 02:59:59,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the Melgar Solid technical advisor has been jailed for using his military address to order parts and ship them to foreign nations.

2441
03:00:01,473 --> 03:00:01,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

2442
03:00:01,893 --> 03:00:03,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2443
03:00:03,274 --> 03:00:04,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2444
03:00:04,235 --> 03:00:04,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2445
03:00:06,017 --> 03:00:07,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's Spazinator.

2446
03:00:07,738 --> 03:00:09,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2447
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:15,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had a couple questions to you and one comment.

2448
03:00:15,784 --> 03:00:15,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

2449
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:27,338
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of my questions, I was wondering, do you know of any websites that sell video game soundtracks?

2450
03:00:27,858 --> 03:00:38,346
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I ask is because all the stores near me very rarely have soundtracks, and I'm kind of a soundtrack nerd, so...

2451
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:41,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Video game soundtracks.

2452
03:00:43,181 --> 03:00:44,701
[SPEAKER_10]: CD Japan still in business?

2453
03:00:45,081 --> 03:00:46,202
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been years since I bought one.

2454
03:00:46,222 --> 03:00:46,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure they are.

2455
03:00:47,082 --> 03:00:48,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that would be one.

2456
03:00:50,423 --> 03:00:53,164
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other Japanese-based sites, too.

2457
03:00:53,444 --> 03:00:57,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of looking at the chat to help fill things in there.

2458
03:00:57,245 --> 03:00:58,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon Japan.

2459
03:00:58,165 --> 03:01:00,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ordered CDs from them before.

2460
03:01:00,426 --> 03:01:00,986
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayAsia.

2461
03:01:01,026 --> 03:01:01,326
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2462
03:01:01,366 --> 03:01:02,986
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayAsia soundtracks.

2463
03:01:03,006 --> 03:01:03,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely PlayAsia.

2464
03:01:03,826 --> 03:01:04,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Check them out.

2465
03:01:04,527 --> 03:01:07,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they sell games, too, if you want to import games and all that stuff.

2466
03:01:07,467 --> 03:01:08,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So they specialize in that stuff.

2467
03:01:08,968 --> 03:01:09,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And toys.

2468
03:01:10,947 --> 03:01:11,367
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2469
03:01:11,527 --> 03:01:13,288
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's some sites to check out.

2470
03:01:13,388 --> 03:01:15,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep an eye on our chat room because they're spitting out a bunch of others too.

2471
03:01:17,930 --> 03:01:18,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Toys and Joys.

2472
03:01:20,592 --> 03:01:38,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as far as the Guitar Hero World Tour, I don't know if you have the PlayStation 3 version or not, or at least tried it, but if you had any issues with the main menu at all where

2473
03:01:39,437 --> 03:01:41,138
[SPEAKER_01]: The graphics in the menu would essentially glitch out?

2474
03:01:41,258 --> 03:01:43,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing this most often when you're playing as a full band or by yourself?

2475
03:02:10,250 --> 03:02:11,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so far, just myself.

2476
03:02:13,913 --> 03:02:35,429
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I noticed is that, you know, the initial, like, logos and the loading screen and whatnot, you know, will appear normal, but as soon as you get to the actual menu where it says, you know, solo play options, so on and so forth, that's when, you know, the background gets all wacky.

2477
03:02:35,449 --> 03:02:39,112
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even see what you're selecting, stuff like that, you know.

2478
03:02:40,440 --> 03:02:41,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard of anything.

2479
03:02:41,741 --> 03:02:49,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say my best suggestion would be go look on the Guitar Hero forums and see if there's others that are having similar problems to you.

2480
03:02:50,165 --> 03:02:53,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's a defect on the disc or if it's a defect in the game that has to be patched.

2481
03:02:53,686 --> 03:02:59,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankly, that scenario wouldn't surprise me at all, sadly, in this day and age of, oh, we'll just patch it to fix it.

2482
03:03:01,490 --> 03:03:03,671
[SPEAKER_10]: And you said you had a comment or another question?

2483
03:03:06,161 --> 03:03:18,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, also on the new guitar and the old guitar from Guitar Hero 3, I noticed that there was some kind of jack or port towards the bottom of the guitar.

2484
03:03:19,498 --> 03:03:20,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what that's for?

2485
03:03:23,503 --> 03:03:26,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I think initially they were going to put in some type of pedal.

2486
03:03:27,629 --> 03:03:29,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we talk about this on a show a long time ago?

2487
03:03:29,491 --> 03:03:30,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I don't know if you remember.

2488
03:03:30,573 --> 03:03:32,936
[SPEAKER_10]: You know that expansion port on the bottom of the Explorer controller?

2489
03:03:33,136 --> 03:03:33,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2490
03:03:33,417 --> 03:03:34,138
[SPEAKER_10]: They never used it.

2491
03:03:34,238 --> 03:03:36,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it going to be for an effector pedal or something at one point?

2492
03:03:36,561 --> 03:03:38,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and they even said it in the Guitar Hero...

2493
03:03:39,905 --> 03:03:40,306
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

2494
03:03:40,326 --> 03:03:41,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero 2 Manual.

2495
03:03:41,767 --> 03:03:42,707
[SPEAKER_09]: But they just never happened.

2496
03:03:42,847 --> 03:03:43,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Never materialized.

2497
03:03:44,048 --> 03:03:45,830
[SPEAKER_10]: They opted for the fog machines instead.

2498
03:03:46,070 --> 03:03:48,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, whatever happened to our rock band fog machine?

2499
03:03:48,812 --> 03:03:49,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out, I think.

2500
03:03:49,893 --> 03:03:50,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it really?

2501
03:03:50,513 --> 03:03:51,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it did.

2502
03:03:51,334 --> 03:03:52,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are we not in possession of one?

2503
03:03:52,735 --> 03:03:53,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're $100.

2504
03:03:54,216 --> 03:03:54,556
[SPEAKER_10]: So?

2505
03:03:54,836 --> 03:03:56,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't thought about buying it yet.

2506
03:03:56,718 --> 03:04:01,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a rock band fog machine so when we start Orange Lounge Radio, I come through a mist of fog.

2507
03:04:02,802 --> 03:04:05,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to fuck up your computer, but we can do it if you want.

2508
03:04:05,845 --> 03:04:06,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not.

2509
03:04:06,434 --> 03:04:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, I've seen it mentioned, the fog machine mentioned, and I think it was either Game Reformer or Official Xbox Magazine, I forget which.

2510
03:04:18,201 --> 03:04:21,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was maybe a month, maybe two months ago.

2511
03:04:22,324 --> 03:04:27,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they may list a website where you can buy it.

2512
03:04:29,188 --> 03:04:32,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look it up and email you...

2513
03:04:33,957 --> 03:04:39,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Link or something It got really good reviews too because they actually made it It's not just like something that randomly does it with

2514
03:04:41,348 --> 03:04:42,789
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2515
03:05:11,184 --> 03:05:12,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

2516
03:05:12,585 --> 03:05:16,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we need this?

2517
03:05:16,169 --> 03:05:16,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Because!

2518
03:05:16,729 --> 03:05:17,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke and lights!

2519
03:05:20,893 --> 03:05:22,715
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want me to gag, then get one.

2520
03:05:22,735 --> 03:05:24,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I just won't be here for whatever episode that's here for.

2521
03:05:25,462 --> 03:05:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want one in my house.

2522
03:05:26,982 --> 03:05:28,223
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

2523
03:05:28,263 --> 03:05:29,483
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to waste the money on this.

2524
03:05:29,563 --> 03:05:30,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do not waste money on this.

2525
03:05:31,304 --> 03:05:31,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

2526
03:05:31,884 --> 03:05:32,124
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2527
03:05:32,664 --> 03:05:33,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Symbols have come in.

2528
03:05:33,664 --> 03:05:34,144
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to do it.

2529
03:05:34,544 --> 03:05:34,804
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2530
03:05:35,005 --> 03:05:38,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Spazinator, we've got to go and wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.

2531
03:05:38,665 --> 03:05:39,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

2532
03:05:40,226 --> 03:05:43,187
[SPEAKER_09]: See if they have this over at the one near me.

2533
03:05:43,727 --> 03:05:46,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Roseville, in Gallery at Roseville, they have it.

2534
03:05:47,088 --> 03:05:47,428
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2535
03:05:47,548 --> 03:05:48,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2536
03:05:48,848 --> 03:05:50,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there are a lot of people still trying to get through.

2537
03:05:51,449 --> 03:05:51,929
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens.

2538
03:05:53,362 --> 03:05:53,602
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2539
03:05:53,622 --> 03:05:54,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're right.

2540
03:05:54,043 --> 03:05:54,463
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need it.

2541
03:05:54,683 --> 03:05:54,964
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2542
03:05:55,304 --> 03:05:56,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Any more last-minute stories?

2543
03:05:56,385 --> 03:05:56,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Loki.

2544
03:05:57,886 --> 03:05:58,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Or DarkSakura.

2545
03:05:58,527 --> 03:05:59,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you have any that you found.

2546
03:06:00,068 --> 03:06:00,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Five.

2547
03:06:01,690 --> 03:06:02,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Is your last-minute story?

2548
03:06:02,631 --> 03:06:02,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2549
03:06:03,231 --> 03:06:03,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

2550
03:06:04,460 --> 03:06:07,941
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a glitch in LittleBigPlanet that will ruin your game.

2551
03:06:09,421 --> 03:06:19,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, if you make a spinning wheel that's set at max speed and you get hit by it, it can possibly cause you to get stuck in a death loop where you'll keep dying.

2552
03:06:20,164 --> 03:06:26,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you exit out of that level, you'll keep dying in the pod and you'll have to delete your save game for it to fix.

2553
03:06:26,966 --> 03:06:28,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, that sucks.

2554
03:06:28,166 --> 03:06:32,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So remember, once again, because... Oh god, and people are going to put that shit on the internet.

2555
03:06:32,689 --> 03:06:33,969
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be those custom levels.

2556
03:06:33,989 --> 03:06:34,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, hold on.

2557
03:06:34,770 --> 03:06:40,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Just remember, your PS3, it's so easy to back up saves on there just to a USB memory card or something like that.

2558
03:06:40,913 --> 03:06:42,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Just back up your save.

2559
03:06:42,094 --> 03:06:43,154
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all you gotta do.

2560
03:06:43,174 --> 03:06:44,995
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good warning.

2561
03:06:45,236 --> 03:06:46,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

2562
03:06:46,576 --> 03:06:50,438
[SPEAKER_09]: If you spawn in the level all of a sudden you see a giant death wheel, don't walk into it.

2563
03:06:50,478 --> 03:06:52,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Just quit the game and say, fuck this.

2564
03:06:53,706 --> 03:06:55,647
[SPEAKER_09]: So wheels at max speed could be a bad thing.

2565
03:06:55,707 --> 03:06:56,807
[SPEAKER_09]: A giant death wheel.

2566
03:06:57,088 --> 03:06:58,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make a towering death wheel.

2567
03:06:58,528 --> 03:07:01,329
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some pretty evil levels on LittleBigPlanet.

2568
03:07:01,509 --> 03:07:06,312
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a ninja level I was playing today that just tries its hardest.

2569
03:07:06,452 --> 03:07:13,835
[SPEAKER_10]: It was as hard as those crazy games online like I Want to Be the Guy and all that stuff that are just crazy fucking hard.

2570
03:07:14,015 --> 03:07:16,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I was watching some of the levels on YouTube here.

2571
03:07:16,756 --> 03:07:18,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kind of going through some of them.

2572
03:07:19,117 --> 03:07:25,421
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them, of course, anybody would do this since it's insensitive, so obviously they're going to do it.

2573
03:07:26,001 --> 03:07:29,163
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a 9-11 level where the guy... Oh, God, no.

2574
03:07:29,183 --> 03:07:34,506
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy flings a thing through buildings, and I think he's dressed up like an Arab as well.

2575
03:07:36,167 --> 03:07:41,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the guy that did the Gradius level, he also did a Kaneda bike from Akira that looks pretty awesome.

2576
03:07:42,951 --> 03:07:45,112
[SPEAKER_09]: He also did a Tetris level that looks really awesome.

2577
03:07:46,293 --> 03:07:47,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And a Beatmania level.

2578
03:07:48,374 --> 03:07:49,275
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no Beatmania level.

2579
03:07:49,295 --> 03:07:51,516
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Bobby said on his show he did a Beatmania level as well.

2580
03:07:51,957 --> 03:07:52,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

2581
03:07:52,417 --> 03:07:52,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2582
03:07:53,078 --> 03:07:53,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool.

2583
03:07:54,579 --> 03:07:58,161
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of crap, but it's supposedly Beatmania.

2584
03:07:58,222 --> 03:07:59,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Beatmania inspired.

2585
03:08:00,643 --> 03:08:00,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2586
03:08:00,924 --> 03:08:01,664
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a good way to put it.

2587
03:08:02,044 --> 03:08:03,345
[SPEAKER_10]: But he says you won't find it on YouTube.

2588
03:08:03,365 --> 03:08:03,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the game.

2589
03:08:04,417 --> 03:08:06,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to show you this one real quick here, Rob.

2590
03:08:07,340 --> 03:08:08,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got poops in it.

2591
03:08:08,501 --> 03:08:10,642
[SPEAKER_09]: In a butt that poops out.

2592
03:08:11,143 --> 03:08:15,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Those little Japanese cute little doody things.

2593
03:08:16,327 --> 03:08:16,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please.

2594
03:08:17,208 --> 03:08:17,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

2595
03:08:17,869 --> 03:08:18,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to see this.

2596
03:08:19,410 --> 03:08:19,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

2597
03:08:19,810 --> 03:08:25,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to find the part where it's at here.

2598
03:08:26,456 --> 03:08:31,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Please put this radio show completely on hold so I can look at a video of pooping in LittleBigPlanet.

2599
03:08:31,320 --> 03:08:33,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, as you can see, the butt right there.

2600
03:08:33,582 --> 03:08:34,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just start it?

2601
03:08:34,263 --> 03:08:34,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just start it.

2602
03:08:34,944 --> 03:08:35,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2603
03:08:36,726 --> 03:08:37,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I hit it?

2604
03:08:37,807 --> 03:08:38,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Start.

2605
03:08:38,227 --> 03:08:38,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

2606
03:08:40,370 --> 03:08:41,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Little turds fall out.

2607
03:08:41,731 --> 03:08:45,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's... And it's a poo monster!

2608
03:08:45,795 --> 03:08:46,556
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

2609
03:08:47,157 --> 03:08:47,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

2610
03:08:49,219 --> 03:08:50,160
[SPEAKER_10]: What will they think of next?

2611
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:52,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so glad that LittleBigPlanet will...

2612
03:08:53,533 --> 03:08:55,614
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have this other one that some guy made.

2613
03:08:55,734 --> 03:08:58,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like K-Truck Race that looks pretty awesome.

2614
03:08:58,715 --> 03:09:02,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bunch of trucks that you get in and have a little off-road race.

2615
03:09:02,237 --> 03:09:03,998
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Excite Truck, but not.

2616
03:09:05,438 --> 03:09:07,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to get out of here.

2617
03:09:08,240 --> 03:09:11,121
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts before we're out of here.

2618
03:09:11,261 --> 03:09:12,902
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought is poop.

2619
03:09:13,502 --> 03:09:14,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought.

2620
03:09:14,863 --> 03:09:17,544
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I've actually got to start messing with this editor now.

2621
03:09:18,344 --> 03:09:18,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks awesome.

2622
03:09:19,105 --> 03:09:21,486
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is pie.

2623
03:09:23,304 --> 03:09:32,308
[SPEAKER_10]: and for those of you guys that have listened to us, be it on the podcast or the live feed, staying up or staying awake with us for the past three hours to listen to the show, thanks a lot.

2624
03:09:33,149 --> 03:09:37,430
[SPEAKER_10]: All we ask, just tell two friends about the show because that's how we spread the word of our show is through word of mouth.

2625
03:09:37,771 --> 03:09:43,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And through such awesome iTunes reviews, five-star iTunes reviews, Boko Fett wrote a really nice one this week.

2626
03:09:44,134 --> 03:09:46,795
[SPEAKER_10]: The hosts are true gamers who are active in the gaming world.

2627
03:09:47,095 --> 03:09:50,296
[SPEAKER_10]: The radio show involves the listeners through multiple avenues.

2628
03:09:52,277 --> 03:09:57,341
[SPEAKER_10]: and give a distinct wide range of opinion, especially from those in chat who act as the fourth host.

2629
03:09:57,801 --> 03:10:01,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall, the show feels like a family who you may have never met, but you know well.

2630
03:10:02,444 --> 03:10:02,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

2631
03:10:03,785 --> 03:10:04,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost makes you want to barf.

2632
03:10:04,746 --> 03:10:05,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so nice.

2633
03:10:05,546 --> 03:10:06,967
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but thank you very much for that nice review.

2634
03:10:07,167 --> 03:10:07,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope to see some more.

2635
03:10:07,928 --> 03:10:09,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel squishy, Rob.

2636
03:10:09,509 --> 03:10:11,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go to the bathroom now.

2637
03:10:11,250 --> 03:10:14,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, you need to open up your poppet and hit the explode button.

2638
03:10:15,533 --> 03:10:16,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Little Big Planet joke.

2639
03:10:17,293 --> 03:10:18,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, until next week.

2640
03:10:19,536 --> 03:10:22,440
[SPEAKER_10]: God, we've told you about 50 games you need to go out and play right now.

2641
03:10:22,500 --> 03:10:24,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything from Symphony of the Night to LittleBigPlanet.

2642
03:10:24,563 --> 03:10:28,469
[SPEAKER_10]: So go play some games and we'll see you next time.

2643
03:10:29,810 --> 03:10:30,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio

2644
03:10:59,622 --> 03:11:00,447
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week!
