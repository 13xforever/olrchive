13752	22409	Tonight, November 16, 2008, Wii music sales are initially disappointing, an old video game movie is getting upgraded for Blu-ray, and as little
31550	34773	Hello Internets and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
34833	41679	We are that podcast and live program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41899	42880	My name is Rob Roberts.
42980	46082	Joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.
46363	46723	Rawr.
47043	47384	How are you?
47764	48024	Rawr.
48344	48605	Rawr.
48925	49165	Rawr.
49365	49706	Rawr.
50166	51287	Rawr.
51767	55150	Tonight is the episode where we will be speaking to ourselves in animal speak all night long.
55911	56091	Meow.
57441	63527	Alright, and also say hello to Miep Miep Miep, uh-huh, uh-huh, Miep Miep, Loki.
64348	65469	I'm not participating in this.
65509	67511	No, we have to speak Simlish.
69613	70834	We're speaking Simlish tonight?
71174	71414	Yeah.
71755	73717	Since that is a little more video game related.
73757	76639	Run through a translation filter back into English.
78861	79622	How are you doing, Loki?
79662	80183	Seriously, though.
80863	81244	Pretty good.
81524	82425	Alright, good, good.
82970	86071	Alright, well, you know how it works here at Orange Lounge Radio.
86111	90312	We do a little program here for about three hours talking about the latest and greatest in gaming.
90612	98254	You know, the show kind of started as us sitting around the table at dinner after a long night of playing DDR and fighting games in the local arcade and some pinball and all that good stuff.
98694	99955	Once in a while, golf, maybe.
100455	104056	And just talking trash about games and other things going on in our lives.
104556	106557	And kind of carried over onto this little program.
106717	108757	We invite you all to our dinner table through our chat room.
109077	110578	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com
111278	118143	and when we tape live on Sunday nights at allgames.com at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
118603	123446	Let's start off tonight's show as we always do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week and we'll start with DarkSakura.
123526	124247	How was your gaming week?
124567	128830	I played something other than Ragnarok, although I did play a lot of Ragnarok.
129030	129751	Oh my gosh, what?
130721	138624	I played, and you saw me play it, the Doctor Who Top Chumps game that thanks to one of our lovely listeners sent to me.
138684	139305	Thank you, Rob.
140445	141846	Not this Rob, but that Rob.
142066	142366	Thank you.
143326	146448	And something will be on its way to you as soon as I am no longer broke.
147308	149630	Um, but it's, it's cool.
149750	151612	I'd never played any Top Trumps game before.
151692	164743	It's kind of, it's really simple, and it, the, I played one of the, um, I guess ones in Adventure Mode, and I went, I did just a single game, and I had to play against a Slothine, which was, you know, I was like, eh, I don't like them.
165403	166924	But I lost my first game.
167545	171067	It wasn't very great losing my first game.
171387	179473	But it's sort of like playing war, but you choose your stats on your card to play against someone else's stats on their card.
180273	183255	And you play for cards too, and it's bizarre.
183335	185156	So it's weird.
185737	191621	So I'm going to try to practice a bit more at it and see if I can get any good at it.
191701	194903	And I also have, even though I haven't played it yet,
195323	220027	I have Castlevania Order of Ecclesia so I'm going to be hopefully giving that a try during the week if I actually have time because I've got two art projects due and my Animal Crossing is coming tomorrow so I'm glad for that and I've also been playing a little bit of Fable Fable 2 so that's it sweet have you been playing anything fun?
222369	222730	I guess.
223390	227293	Now, I played this week more Saints Row 2 because I've already finished the game.
227754	234259	I'm going for 100% completions, so I've been playing through the mini-games, which are actually pretty easy so far.
234299	243446	I think some of them are difficult, like some of the insurance fraud can be difficult because it's kind of random of what cars come and how many times you get hit and that kind of thing.
244287	244367	Um...
245836	274743	but like I finished the septic adventure part where you spray sewage onto people and property and that's funny because you fling poo at them and also played through some of the helicopter assault stuff which is also fun because you're just firing rockets at things then also went and played through some of the online of that trying to get some more ranks and badges and stuff and
275683	279467	I wish it wasn't so cumbersome, because getting to the ranked games, it takes forever.
280308	285493	And once you're done with that, there's no going back to a lobby or going into another game.
285553	289997	It just kicks you back out to the main menu and you have to go through the whole thing again and again.
290738	291679	So that's kind of lame.
291959	295803	But eventually I'll get enough trophies, I guess, if I stick with it long enough.
296664	298625	But I am 80% done with the game, so that's awesome.
299405	311651	Then the other thing I've played this week, of course, we switched to Grand Theft Auto 4 for multiplayer because people got tired of me beating them all the time in Saints Row 2, so now they want me to beat them all the time in Grand Theft Auto 4.
311831	313632	So that's what's been going on.
314653	315174	Thanks for watching!
327281	327822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
346101	347282	Whatever, it looks fun.
347843	349725	So I'm looking forward to checking that out.
350185	355390	I went back and played some Rock Band 2 because I finally got my cymbals for my new drum set.
356371	359194	Because I vowed that I wouldn't play the drum set until I got the cymbals.
359754	362037	And now that I've got the cymbals, it's pretty awesome.
363198	366161	Unfortunately, I got only a 2-pack because they weren't selling 3-packs yet.
367422	367762	It sucks.
369651	375595	Then I went ahead, I didn't really get to play Animal Crossing this week, but we did get it a little early.
376836	379438	I've been watching my wife hog the game.
380879	389164	I played it at PAX, and just from what I've seen, it really is almost exactly the same as the other two games.
390505	391466	Very minor changes.
391486	395631	In fact, there's a few things that are kind of neat in it, but they don't even mention them at all.
396091	401877	Like, apparently, there's like an Easter egg if you take a certain path each time.
402558	405340	Like, say you start the game and immediately run across this one bridge or something.
405381	410586	Well, eventually it will carve out a path for you in the leaves or in the grass or something.
410706	412067	So that's kind of a neat little Easter egg.
412728	413148	Thanks for watching!
427967	429509	I blame the economy and the stock market and gas prices.
450911	458554	I'm getting to the point now where I have too many things to play at once.
458934	467497	Ubisoft sent me a copy of Snowboarding for the 360 and then I got a copy of Rain Man's Raving Rabbids TV Party that I got to try out.
468717	474900	And DS games, I'm going to try to play Trackmania DS this week because I like the PC version.
476120	501572	also Line Raider 2 at some point and I got a download code for Banjo-Kazooie so I'm probably able to try that because I never really actually played the original and god, Fallout 3 at some point because I still haven't finished that and I gotta finish Fable 2 so it's busy but Animal Crossing does mark the last game I'm buying this year so that's nice oh and Resistance too, I still gotta play that
502935	503336	SingStar Abba
519494	521816	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
543457	544058	It's great.
544238	545299	I mean, what am I going to say?
545519	547121	Obviously, I'm already addicted to WoW.
547901	549383	What am I going to add to this?
549883	550504	I will say this.
550704	555749	They've really kind of kicked up a notch this expansion compared to the last one, the Burning Crusade.
556770	561014	The new dungeons are pretty awesome, the three I've played so far.
561494	562054	Thanks for watching!
581085	586827	is actually really awesome because it's nothing but epic boss fights for a five man, which is pretty cool.
587267	588788	And some of the quests are neat.
589428	595350	They've added this whole new vehicle thing into the game, which is kind of fun, kind of controls a little bit differently.
596311	603773	And I think for lore fans, I'm not huge on the lore in WoW, but I know lore fans are really getting a kick out of this one with some of the twists that are on it.
604274	607795	And if you're into WoW, you probably already bought this game.
608315	619900	If you're somebody who used to play WoW that's debating coming back, you might want to take advantage of that offer that Blizzard's doing where you can get the 10-day free pass to Burning Crusade and all that.
620180	625422	Because I'm going to tell you what, for new people, there's really not a lot in Wrath of the Lich King for you.
625442	627283	That's actually probably the game's shortcoming.
628044	631225	Whereas in Burning Crusade, at least you have Blood Elves, Draenei,
631625	632146	Thanks for watching!
650945	653927	But otherwise, there's not a lot for new people.
654007	655487	There's not a lot you're going to see at level 1.
656408	662831	Granted, you have a new profession, a haircut thing, but that's not worth $40 for the expansion.
663392	672216	But if you do have a level 70 character, if you've quit WoW during the Burning Crusade and you're kind of curious what's changed with this, I definitely think Lich King is worth checking out.
672616	676558	So definitely check out Wrath of the Lich King if you're a Warcraft fan.
676659	679180	If you're not, there's nothing here that's going to win you over.
679580	679981	I don't think.
680161	684366	Although I do think the quest lines so far in the dungeons from 70 to 80 have been awesome.
684786	686027	And I love the music too.
686328	688450	The music has been very ambient and pretty awesome.
688731	690493	And it has a zone called the Fjord.
691113	692575	And who doesn't love the word Fjord?
692635	695398	And yes, it has Vikings and all that stuff, which is pretty awesome.
695899	697000	And you get to kill them in the face.
698120	699681	And that's pretty much been my gaming week.
699761	702843	I also have gotten to get my grubby little hands on Animal Crossing.
703684	705705	I haven't really gotten to play it very much at all.
706585	707286	But I would agree.
707506	710548	There's not a lot here we haven't seen.
710888	714651	And kind of as I was saying on Bobby's show as we were doing the toss over to our program tonight.
717292	719373	The GameCube, in a way, was almost a better deal.
719674	727458	I mean, granted, you have the online stuff now, and there's a few new things here and there, but you don't get to unlock the old-school NES games anymore.
727518	733122	And Loki, when we were talking about it on Bobby's show, you had a great idea for how Animal Crossing kind of put that magic back, right?
733282	738765	Yeah, I mean, like they've been doing with some of their other Nintendo games that come out, add some minigames in there.
738825	739826	Make some minigames.
740226	743008	You can even make them like retro NES games or something like that.
744548	744809	I mean...
746013	750895	or even like, was it with, you know, just have, and he has demos or something.
750975	752636	Hell, they did it with Smash Brothers.
753036	756497	I don't know why that's such a big deal now or just something.
756517	758758	Game and watch games for heaven's sakes.
758818	760139	Just something, you know?
760239	763660	Like, I don't know what it is about mini games, but hey, it is Nintendo after all, right?
763920	782109	It's just, it seems like that they're not trying, that they're just basically putting in the most basic content ever, and they're making it so that you don't have to play this, you know, multiple times a week or something like that, even though you probably should if this is, you know, a game that you're going to be playing, because that's how you play this, is you have to constantly go back and maintain stuff.
782549	790273	But, like, the city is literally all the, you know, special event stuff that would happen, you know, all the people coming and visiting your town, they're all in the city now, which...
791013	792033	The city is kind of lame.
792153	794214	I wish it was like other villages.
794274	795715	Maybe expand your village.
795775	798415	Maybe, I don't know, make it look different.
798916	799916	Put some effort.
800016	801056	You know, here's what it is.
801116	805918	I think, you know, whereas we loved Animal Crossing and the minigames thing I think is important because
806258	808160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
825155	826637	I remember we had a lot of that going on.
826657	829479	There was incentive to go back and forth.
829519	832062	Whereas at least you still have the items and things.
832122	834324	Hey, come visit my Shrine of Fire and all this stuff.
835865	838387	Honestly, I think Animal Crossing has become a game for 10-year-olds.
840429	843592	Exclusively for the tween area.
843692	846354	Like the 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds.
847255	849237	I don't think there's anything left for us old folks anymore.
849357	850078	It was really...
851162	855427	What's the fear of actually putting virtual console games in this game?
855767	861233	Okay, so it may cut down on the sales of your virtual console games that you have featured in this.
861734	862274	Who cares?
862314	863175	They're digital.
863335	865378	It's not like you have to manufacture discs.
865438	866199	It costs you nothing.
866259	870383	If anything, you sell more copies of Animal Crossing and you get more people to do it.
870443	871564	Hell, you could maybe even...
872245	873827	Charge them as download content.
874107	875829	Or here's an idea.
876109	880474	The virtual console games that you have on your system you can put in your house or something like that.
881014	882075	Or select ones.
882095	883577	Like say if I own Super Mario Bros.
883617	884898	I can put Super Mario Bros.
884918	886340	game in my game or something.
886360	888382	Or I can purchase Super Mario Bros.
888422	889563	and put it in my house or something.
889583	889603	I...
890942	892463	It's just, it's lazy.
892603	893524	All it is is lazy.
893684	894945	You know, here's the thing about Nintendo.
895205	900908	The disappointing thing for me as a hardcore gamer is that Nintendo is still going to sell like hotcakes this Christmas.
901289	902689	Wii's are still going to be a must-have.
902830	904651	Wii Fit is still going to sell like crazy.
904991	906572	Soccer moms are going to buy this for their kids.
906892	911775	and honestly, things like, you know, look, this has been like a recurring trend on this show.
912255	916578	We bashed Wii Music previously and said, but it's probably really good for 10 year olds.
916978	921220	Here we are bashing Animal Crossing, but your 10 year old will probably have a lot of fun with it.
921760	922801	Why would I get Wii Fit?
922921	925943	I won't probably exercise much with it, but my 10 year old probably will.
927364	930846	The Wii is not being taken seriously by a lot of us hardcore gamers anymore.
930946	932908	It's the kid system.
933068	934289	Will it still sell?
934349	934629	Sure.
934930	939433	But they're going to lose a lot of credibility with us if they don't start turning around some games fast in 2009.
939733	942535	And to lose that brand loyalty is going to be painful.
943136	943756	Well, here's the thing.
943776	947259	Remember before, the GameCube, it was looked at as a kid system.
947519	950281	The Wii hasn't changed that at all.
950381	954004	In fact, now they're really pushing it that it's more of a kid system or
954124	955025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
976061	976562	Change it.
976682	979504	Make it different than the last two that you put out.
980125	981586	Can you imagine if Super Mario Bros.
981866	982267	3 came out?
982487	984328	It was exactly the same as Super Mario Bros.
984529	986210	1 except it was at night or something.
986550	987852	That's seriously what they're doing.
987952	988712	It's just the same.
988732	989253	With Wii Speak.
990114	993156	Yeah, it's seriously that bad.
993757	995238	It's just they're not trying at all.
995398	998861	And the sad thing is it's because it's Animal Crossing and people will buy it.
1000233	1001073	They're not going to learn!
1021519	1025962	That's fine if 10-year-olds are happy with Animal Crossing because maybe they didn't play the other versions of the game.
1026002	1026362	That's fine.
1026622	1033687	But they'll be equally disappointed when Animal Crossing 2 or whenever the next one comes out for the next Nintendo system, they're like, holy crap, this is exactly the same as the last one I played.
1033847	1037129	And we'll be going, holy crap, it's exactly the same as the last three I've played.
1038110	1045075	Queltipo in chat says, yeah, but at least GameCube had the debut of Resident Evil 4 to combat the supposed kiddiness and eternal darkness, too.
1047359	1049860	It still looks like a Nintendo 64 game.
1049920	1055203	I mean, that's really... I have the Nintendo 64 version, so that's all it is.
1055583	1057304	It doesn't even have to be the look.
1057424	1062206	It's just they didn't change... The towns are basically the same as the other ones.
1062286	1064507	But maybe they're just saying the formula works, why mess with it?
1066440	1071662	I really don't have a lot of incentive to buy this game, although I guess I already have it, but to recommend it to others.
1073742	1077463	Here's a very interesting counterpoint to your whole Mario at Night thing.
1077783	1081824	GameGuru says someone hasn't played Lost Levels, which was Super Mario Bros.
1082044	1082565	2 in Japan.
1083005	1084345	In a way, Super Mario Bros.
1084505	1088886	2 in Japan was Mario at Night, but the levels were different.
1089086	1094168	They did have poison mushrooms, a difference between Mario and Luigi, but the look was the same.
1094588	1095208	Thanks for watching!
1111833	1113896	Yet another great comment from Janai in chat.
1114196	1115378	Chatroom's got great comments tonight.
1116079	1120164	Janai in chat says, Nintendo is really pissing on its fans for not bringing Mother 3 out.
1120644	1122247	That's a great comment.
1122487	1127934	So meanwhile, while they're cranking out these games, they've got a game that might appeal to us that they refuse to release here in the U.S.
1129645	1130025	Amazing.
1131987	1135070	Alright, well anyhow, that's pretty much going to do it for my gaming week.
1135571	1144059	Let's get into some housekeeping news tonight, of which we don't have an awful lot, but I do want to make sure I announce here, towards the top of the show, we have a special guest joining us tonight.
1144319	1145200	It's going to be awesome.
1146681	1153506	I know you guys have heard about the Xbox 360 New Xbox Experience is coming out pretty soon, this next coming week.
1153807	1158190	Well, one thing that's going to be rolling out on this is the community games on the Xbox 360.
1158330	1164135	You might remember when these things were first previewed a few months ago at the Game Developers Conference, I said, this is it.
1164355	1165696	This is going to be a huge thing.
1166397	1167738	This is going to be like the YouTube...
1168098	1168238	Snake!
1197978	1199079	Snake360.com Snake360.com
1225261	1228991	This Game, and Music Games that we've talked about in the past.
1229271	1230735	And we'll talk about that a little later.
1231437	1231778	Meanwhile...
1233078	1234159	That's really it for housekeeping.
1234199	1237161	Otherwise, I'm just going to say, hey, join us on Facebook at OL Army.
1237241	1241124	Join us on MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio, and join us on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge.
1241444	1242765	And Twitter at OLR.
1243285	1249829	And this week, I will not ignore the pre-OLR twit like I did last week, and I apologize for that.
1250310	1254893	I will read your twits tonight when we get to that story on Samba de Amigo.
1255873	1256894	But we're not ready for that yet.
1257014	1260697	We're going to get some other stories first, and Loki is going to start us off tonight.
1260717	1261037	That's right.
1261057	1262718	It should be called Show Us Your Twits.
1264783	1265485	I like that.
1265546	1267471	I think that should be the official name of the saying.
1267491	1268414	You like that, DarkSakura?
1268434	1268855	I like that.
1269256	1269797	Sure.
1270098	1271001	Show us your twits.
1272452	1273233	Very good, Loki.
1273253	1273653	All right.
1274053	1275695	Quite clever tonight.
1275895	1281339	Anyways, so kind of going into what we were just talking about, disappointment in Nintendo.
1281779	1285082	Wii Music has definitely been disappointing for Nintendo.
1285542	1290066	It's actually only sold so far not even 100,000 units.
1290166	1294930	Only 81,000 units according to the NPD or according to Nintendo, 65,000 to 66,000 units.
1294950	1295370	I don't know.
1301826	1307648	I can see why, because the game itself, really there's no point to it.
1308628	1309108	It's a toy.
1310349	1315171	Something that could have been literally downloaded on their WiiWare service, which it probably should have been.
1316260	1319502	Jamie, you were the lone holdout for Wii Music on this program.
1319522	1321703	Did you get a chance to check it out yet?
1322883	1323143	No.
1323464	1323904	That's all right.
1324044	1325645	Because I've had school.
1325665	1326805	I was just curious.
1326865	1328266	Honestly, better games to play.
1330307	1331688	So finally you're admitting it.
1331708	1333028	There are better things out there.
1333329	1336290	No, I admitted it from the beginning that there were better things to play.
1336570	1339512	I just said that I liked it.
1339612	1340432	I thought it was cute.
1341473	1345835	My inner musician sang out and went, cool, I did this crap in music theory.
1347418	1362929	I say it's great too for 10 year olds but anyway I don't think a 10 year old would even want to play this I'm sorry this is like for like 5 year olds it's for kids that like shake around shit that don't know what they're doing you know in a game they're like oh my god it's like I'm making music
1364711	1365412	Hey, you know what?
1365432	1375095	That's cool because sometimes the parents want to go talk and have adult conversations whereas the little kids are screaming and being annoying and put them in front of this and they'll shut up.
1375315	1380617	Now, is the numbers here skewed a little bit because this game came out late in the month?
1380677	1380977	I think so.
1382237	1386041	To be honest, 81,000 doesn't sound like a bad number to me.
1386121	1392966	I mean, maybe it's under expectations, but you consider there's been other music games out there, like probably Beatmania didn't sell that much.
1392986	1399452	Well, this was released, this is basically one week worth of sales, because this was released in the second to last week of the month.
1400632	1405415	But to be honest, from what I've seen, it's not selling very well at all.
1405935	1406555	Interesting.
1409797	1411718	It's just... I don't know.
1412138	1420243	I think people... Once again, they're trying to find games that the people that buy the Wii system for Wii Sports would possibly buy.
1420363	1421824	That is really their challenge right now.
1422464	1428047	What can we do to get people to buy games that really don't want to buy other games other than Wii Sports?
1428367	1429108	Wii Lacrosse!
1429668	1430009	WeSports2
1449949	1454551	and then the parents are like, well, Wii Sports is fun for the whole family and I'm not really bored of that yet.
1455232	1459914	Funny point from YYR in chat, Wii Music has sold more copies than Rock Revolution, fact.
1462066	1463867	We won't go there with Rock Revolution.
1466688	1467808	That's a whole other can of worms.
1467848	1468688	Let's move on, shall we?
1469249	1471670	Folks are kicking Nintendo while they're down, apparently.
1472330	1480693	Motiva is an Ohio-based company, and they've, of course, filed a lawsuit, yet another one against Nintendo, saying that the Wiimote is violating their patent.
1480953	1486295	They filed it in 2004, technology used to create a human movement measurement system.
1486795	1495122	that will use a handheld tracking device in communication with a base station that is then used to create an interactive gaming experience among other capabilities.
1495562	1496583	Now here's what I want to know.
1496603	1501226	Nintendo's getting sued by all these people that claim they have the patent for the Wii Remote and stuff.
1502687	1504769	How can everybody have the patent for the Wii Remote?
1505570	1508952	Because there's all these people that are suing them saying that they have patents for this stuff.
1510006	1514048	Shouldn't they be suing each other because now they have patents that also kind of overlap?
1514128	1514868	It's weird.
1514988	1516389	Yeah, that's the part I don't really get either.
1516609	1516989	Yeah, right.
1517049	1519351	All these people are claiming we invented the Wii years ago.
1519371	1520791	Well, we invented the Wii Remote.
1520851	1524573	Well, no, we just paid a settlement to this other company and said they invented the Wii Remote.
1524673	1528995	You need to dish it out with them then because they're the ones that actually claimed the... I am Spartacus.
1529856	1531136	No, I am Spartacus.
1531376	1532857	No, I am Spartacus.
1533497	1535638	Yeah, it's really ridiculous.
1537659	1537679	I...
1539048	1544409	And it's also, it's like, oh my god, we didn't realize they were so similar two years after it came out.
1545690	1555012	I'd be really curious to see what happens with one of these lawsuits, because we keep hearing about, oh, somebody's suing them, somebody's suing them, yet we haven't heard about really anybody winning or losing yet.
1556293	1561774	Yeah, it's basically, it's like, yeah, we created the Wii Remote, we want you to pay up.
1563032	1568174	Well, I think we created the Wii Remote and all these hundreds of thousands of dollars say we did.
1568414	1570154	Okay, yes, you created the Wii Remote.
1570635	1571355	Thank you very much.
1583519	1583799	and more.
1606479	1608780	I have to reset that joke now, excuse me.
1609120	1611000	Well, in Soviet Russia, joke tell you.
1611801	1615042	So we called TiVo this week to get a comment on this story, and you know what they told us?
1615882	1616502	I am Spartacus.
1618483	1620863	Okay, well, I don't feel bad now for interrupting that joke.
1622024	1629746	No, I was going to say, what's going to be an interesting turn of event is when TiVo sues Nintendo over the technology for a pointer and, you know, that kind of an airface.
1631880	1632380	We'll see.
1633061	1633481	We'll see.
1633581	1635923	It's just lawsuit after lawsuit in the world.
1635963	1636884	Can't we all just get along?
1637224	1638485	No, but it's not allowed to.
1639126	1640907	Don't you know that war is the true way of things?
1642429	1643770	Actually, it's not, but still.
1645151	1646272	War is population control.
1646833	1651056	So, Nintendo is being sneaky.
1651697	1653338	Very, very sneaky.
1654299	1662626	And their sneakiness will definitely fool a few people, but they haven't said anything about it efficiently, nor have they actually...
1666809	1671151	You know, put any kind of thing on their site from what I understand.
1671231	1674252	So it was actually seen at Target.
1674572	1675672	It's official.
1676233	1682055	It is a multiplayer control set is what it's called.
1682575	1692879	There is a Mario Kart wheel, a Wii remote and nunchuck, and it's $74.99, which is actually more expensive than getting them all individually.
1693319	1693459	So...
1695354	1696275	Yeah.
1697456	1698016	That's sweet.
1698036	1700157	Two cents more, according to Kotaku.
1700257	1705681	But at the same time, it's like, okay, why?
1706465	1707766	Why do you even need the damn wheel?
1708086	1708606	Actually, no.
1708646	1709566	I think that's more than that.
1709626	1711027	Because I think the wheel itself is only $10.
1712288	1714108	Although some people charge $15 for it.
1714128	1714969	Depends on where you go.
1715329	1718010	I think they're going over official retail price.
1718110	1722172	Well, officially it's supposed to be $10.
1722352	1725373	So it's actually $5 more expensive than buying them separately.
1725934	1726254	I think.
1726654	1730496	In fact, I will... Well, I don't know why I'm looking at GameStop's website.
1730516	1732857	But I think they have theirs for $15.
1733357	1734337	I know we sell them for $10.
1736058	1738359	That's just funny.
1739419	1743000	But yeah, another kind of holiday gift thing.
1743060	1746561	I mean, you really don't need the Wii wheel, but I guess people have trouble.
1746621	1751563	Oh no, we have to have the Wii wheel or we don't have the proper grip on the thingy.
1752574	1755375	Yeah, the Wii wheel sells for $14.99.
1755636	1756936	I thought it was supposed to be $10.
1756996	1762519	I know that I've seen two different SRPs from them and one was $14.99 and one was $10.
1763600	1764800	But I think they're supposed to be $10.
1764900	1767302	But people still charge $15 because guess what?
1767342	1769183	People don't know better and they will buy it for $15.
1771767	1773308	That's because people are dumbasses.
1773428	1774529	Okay, I have to admit something.
1774549	1783195	Through the magic of radio, you may not have even known I was gone, but I had to run in the house because I've had a migraine and I don't remember if I said that at the top of the show, so I was making myself some coffee so I could have some caffeine because that's good for headaches.
1784436	1785997	What the hell is so damn funny?
1786738	1789020	I heard you literally laughing all the way in the house.
1789040	1796305	That their combo, that their bundle here with one remote nunchuck and a Wii wheel is actually more expensive than buying them all separately.
1798686	1799307	That is pretty funny.
1800107	1800708	I have a bagel.
1802105	1824214	so uh yes i also ran in to get jamie a bagel and really i mean why should you buy this in a big old bundle like this when i'm sure right next to all of them are the individual components separate of each other and it's just stupid but whatever you know can't hurt them for trying i'm sure that's probably like one of those target exclusive sets or something like that
1824704	1825924	I didn't say anything on the box.
1826024	1827685	It's official Nintendo stuff.
1827865	1834767	Well, yeah, but sometimes I know with like Activision, they make special bundles for like Guitar Hero and stuff like that for different retailers.
1835368	1841930	And, you know, it won't say Atari exclusive or whatever, but it's made exclusively for those retailers.
1844241	1846042	Oh my god, the room smells like caffeine.
1846622	1846942	Sorry.
1847422	1847922	No, it's good.
1848542	1848842	Sorry.
1849203	1852244	No, I gotta be up at work at 6 in the morning.
1852264	1854144	I know, now I'm never going to be able to go to sleep tonight.
1854184	1855385	That's okay, I can stay up and play WoW.
1855945	1861146	Well, speaking of innovation, Nintendo has revealed their 2009 lineup, or early 2009, basically for...
1866468	1866988	Mario & Luigi RPG 3
1882919	1886100	is scheduled to come out February 11th to the DS.
1886340	1887761	Okay, now there's a good game.
1887941	1889141	Yes, that's a cool game.
1890462	1893163	Castlevania Judgment, they're getting it a little bit late.
1893703	1897325	And Play for Wii Mario Tennis coming January 15th.
1899305	1906527	Play for Wii Mario Tennis is the port of the GameCube game with Wii controls now.
1907747	1914369	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time will be coming to both DS and Wii on January 29th.
1915609	1921230	Also not listed on there would be Sin and Punishment 2 and Punch-Out.
1923271	1924791	But maybe soon after that.
1926583	1928605	Queltipo gives a nice, mature summary of the 2009 lineup for Nintendo.
1928625	1929026	Yay, Mario & Luigi.
1929046	1929887	Fart to everything else.
1946826	1952371	I don't know, Punch-Out might be kind of cool even if they're just capitalizing on Wii Sports, the boxing game.
1952391	1953111	Hey, it's Punch-Out!
1953372	1956434	You know, I didn't realize Punch-Out had been re-released so many times.
1956494	1959977	Like, they've had different versions for like the Super Nintendo and stuff like that.
1959997	1961358	The Super Nintendo one was awesome!
1961739	1962700	It was kind of underrated.
1963780	1966082	It might be pretty neat, but, you know, I...
1968055	1973180	I don't have much faith in Nintendo just because of the example of their products that have come out recently.
1973240	1975642	It doesn't seem like they're trying.
1975682	1977504	Sin and Punishment might be pretty cool because the first one was fun.
1977524	1982028	Sin and Punishment looks awesome, but it just doesn't look like they're trying.
1982048	1986813	The stuff that's developed in-house just doesn't seem to be that good.
1988581	1989881	Shonen Jump is a manga compilation.
2014409	2014669	Oh, okay.
2015529	2016970	So how much did I talk about video games in there?
2017170	2019390	There's ads for stuff and little articles in there.
2019470	2023371	Well, for whatever reason, this game got the jump on Blood of Bahamut, which is the game that Squeenix is teasing.
2023772	2031454	It's a DS game, and apparently what you do, you can play this game with four people locally, and you defend your city from attacks.
2031514	2032694	So it's like a city defense game.
2033794	2037035	Apparently, though, you build them on a creature or something.
2037515	2039416	At least that's what the teaser image kind of makes it look like.
2040436	2041917	So there'll be more information.
2041937	2043517	That's where Bahamut comes into things.
2043777	2044197	I'm assuming.
2044838	2048679	We'll be hearing more on this game soon, but who knows if it's coming to the US or not.
2048719	2059644	I would assume it is, because Squeenix has gotten a little better about their whole universal game, you know, worldwide game thing, especially if Last Remnant's any indication, which, god damn, there's another game I gotta play this holiday season.
2060965	2062726	It's like SimCity of the Colossus.
2065174	2066155	So there you go.
2066555	2069998	I'm sure there's a lot of Squeenix fans who are going to be curious to check this one out.
2070018	2073861	But yet again, another kind of interesting game for the DS.
2075102	2076543	Why is the DS getting all the love?
2076583	2082868	I guess it's because more people own DSs than anything else, but I don't know.
2083448	2085830	You know, it's just like I was saying last week when I was talking about Order of Ecclesia.
2086451	2087952	Why can't we have these games on consoles?
2088192	2091615	I want to play them on my television, not when I'm lying in my bed playing my DS.
2091675	2093216	They should make a DS TV tuner.
2094986	2095866	Yes and no.
2097287	2113351	I think the idea is cool in theory, but at the same time, I want them to have a platformer, like the type of thing you'd see on the DS, but with that LittleBigPlanet-style graphics, really sharp, good-looking, use the high-end graphics.
2113571	2116551	They already have a TV tuner for the DS in Japan.
2116991	2122633	And they also have it if you review games and you're putting together professional stuff, but the rest of us...
2123593	2125274	Yeah, if we have a DS dev kit.
2126475	2127015	Exactly.
2127315	2128897	Like we'd ever get one of those.
2130177	2130698	You know what?
2131038	2131498	It could happen.
2132839	2133279	You never know.
2133680	2134560	It would never happen.
2136161	2140644	Well, let's move on and talk about some release dates and some of the games we will be getting our hands on a little bit sooner.
2140944	2142585	We'll start with our friends over in Europe, right, Jamie?
2143046	2143586	Exactly.
2143606	2149110	For our UK releases, and this is stuff that we may or may not get our hands on, but yeah.
2150370	2172525	On the 18th is Evercrack 2, The Shadow Odyssey Spore, Creepy and Cute, Parts Pack Try saying that three times fast, shit Lord of the Rings Online, Minds of Moria 19th, New Xbox Experience 20th, Last Remnant 21st is a whole shitload of stuff, you ready?
2174335	2174555	Sure.
2175396	2176937	Which is not a surprise, by the way.
2177417	2181060	Even though they don't have Thanksgiving over in Europe, it's still the same busy period it is here.
2181580	2202975	There's Cubello, Orbeant, Roto-Hex, Cradle of Rome, Gothic 3, Forsaken Gods, Grand Theft Auto 4, Hasbro Family Game Night, whatever, Left 4 Dead, that's on PC and Xbox 360, Legendary, LocoRoco 2, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, My Dog Coach, Understand Your Dog with Cesar Millan,

2394756	2396677	I want to buy it just to kind of check it out.
2396697	2401460	They want you to make your judgment on it and judge with your wallet and do not buy it.
2401840	2406523	Or if you are planning on buying it, wait a few weeks for it to really suck and then to drop the price on it.
2407503	2408043	Find it used?
2408444	2408684	Yes.
2408744	2410305	Maybe I can find Rock Revolution used now.
2411491	2412772	It's probably getting cheaper.
2413592	2414433	I can only imagine.
2414933	2415994	Pet's Monkey House.
2416794	2420156	Now you have monkeys infesting your DS.

2468286	2473776	Agatha Christie's Evil Under the... It would probably sell more than Rock Revolution based on name alone.

2477142	2477703	Who cares?

2517780	2519500	But really, why even bother?
2520341	2522282	And Tony Hawk's Motion on DS.

2547019	2548159	Pet's Crazy Monkeys on the Wii.
2548179	2551701	Which, by the way, Loki played it at PAX on stage in front of everyone.
2551982	2552342	Comedy.
2552998	2561946	Yes, I wanted to play the actual part where you can slide around on the moose using the Wii balance board, and you sit on it and lean back and forth.
2562426	2570433	Oh, yeah, sure, you can play that after you play this dancing game with some chicks, the frag dolls.
2570753	2572175	Oh, and we're going to videotape you.
2572515	2576398	Oh, and then when you're done, we're going to say, fuck off, and you're not going to get to play the actual thing you wanted to play.
2576418	2579141	You know what was great about that whole thing is that...
2580303	2584508	You were there to play something else that was being horribly ignored by everybody.
2584548	2587191	And you were really excited to check out a different game at the booth, right?
2587271	2588392	I don't remember what it was.
2588873	2590294	I wanted to play Rayman's Raven Rabbids.
2590334	2593738	But there was something else in the booth that you went over there first to go play.
2593778	2594118	Hawks?
2594419	2595139	Yeah, I think that's what it was.
2595500	2597422	And then the cute girl came up and was like,
2597722	2600965	Hi, you want to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids?
2601125	2602245	No, I didn't even do that.
2602265	2607309	I was like, you know, I wanted to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids because that's kind of one of the things I wanted to do when I got there.
2607369	2608590	But I didn't want to play the dance game.
2608610	2610452	I'm like, I want to play that one.
2610572	2613734	I've done the dance game in the other one and it was, guess what?
2614014	2615515	Not much different than this one.
2615816	2617377	And everyone's like, oh, getting real into it.
2617417	2619358	I'm like, yay.
2620039	2621220	This is awesome.

2642956	2643897	CSI New York.
2644097	2646318	I do not want the kook Cats Clan on my DS.
2646338	2646579	Yes.
2649133	2650474	Yes, that's bad.
2651394	2652254	No Cat's Clan.
2653074	2655455	No CCC.
2655775	2658156	Imagine Ballet Star coming to the DS.

2661517	2662417	No, really it's not.
2662757	2665078	Championship Foosball coming to the Wii.
2665298	2668358	Yes, these are the games that demand your attention on the Wii.

2670663	2671864	It's foosball!
2672365	2672865	On the Wii!
2672925	2673806	Exactly!
2674567	2675367	Lips coming to 360.

2683035	2684116	Also comes with a soundtrack.
2684156	2686137	Kind of a little fancy deal that they've got going there.
2687218	2687959	God damn.
2687979	2689360	Still not done.
2689801	2691342	Alone in the Dark Inferno.
2691402	2693684	This is the version that's supposed to be not broken.
2694425	2694825	We'll see.
2694845	2694885	Um...
2696974	2702835	Popstar Guitar with two guitar grips on the Wii and Popstar Guitar on the PlayStation 2.
2703076	2709777	Yes, this is another guitar hero rip-off game or guitar freaks rip-off or whoever you want to rip off.
2710237	2712178	It sucks with pop music, so don't buy it.
2714078	2717139	Burnout Anthology, coming out with the last three Burnout games.
2719760	2720460	Let's see here.
2722301	2723982	The Last Remnant on Xbox 360.
2724022	2725622	That looks pretty awesome.
2728424	2731025	Age of Empire Mythologies on the DS.
2731745	2733466	Cake Mania in the Mix on Wii.
2734166	2735787	All Star Cheer Squad on the DS.
2737669	2739090	and I think I'm getting into next week.
2739190	2739690	So we're done.
2739951	2740271	Sweet.
2740531	2741192	Thank God.
2741512	2741752	All right.
2742192	2746616	Let's get into some of the Japanese releases and talk about what's coming out in Japan.
2746636	2753142	There's a game on the Xbox 360 called Otomedius Gorgeous which looks pretty hot and I'd like to know where the hell this game is in America.
2753162	2754803	That is an arcade game from Konami.
2754863	2756104	I know it's a Konami game.
2756164	2758046	It's like Proteus but it's bigger.
2758066	2762650	It's a shooter with hot chicks and the shooter actually looks kind of graphically pretty fun.
2764091	2766333	It kind of looks like UN Squadron to me a little bit.
2766534	2767454	Is it on Wii, you said?
2767655	2769817	No, it's on Xbox 360, of all things.
2770197	2771538	So this game looks pretty hot.
2771578	2772639	That's coming out this week in Japan.
2773200	2776103	Also coming out, The Last Remnant is coming out in Japan this week.
2776283	2779466	And it's also coming out in a bundle-style thing.
2779546	2781828	So keep an eye out for that because they're hoping to sell some...
2783710	2784831	I'm dying to play...
2806940	2810363	Why don't they just port, like, Guitar Freaks or something?
2810443	2811023	Seriously.
2825891	2831295	Animal Crossing, City Folk hits the Japanese shores as well, as well as the version that has We Speak.
2832235	2836038	Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes gets a price reduction this week.
2836058	2837559	It's not a new game, but it gets a price reduction.
2837619	2840401	If you want a new game, check out this new game from Compile.
2840881	2841842	We love Compile, right?
2842362	2843483	Sugoro Chronicle.
2844184	2849547	Migite ni ken o hidarait ni saikoro o comes out this week.
2849647	2851649	And I have no idea what the hell this game's about.
2851709	2854851	It looks like it's some type of board game translation that's coming out in Japan.
2855211	2859253	Kind of like, I guess you could say, a Mario Party-ish game, but it looks like there's some RPG elements in that game.
2860634	2861635	Doesn't look half bad, though.
2863155	2868238	Coming out on the handheld systems, or actually, let's take a look quick at PlayStation 2, because some folks still have that.
2868298	2876763	You also get another version of Mercenaries 2, World in Flames, as well as a game called Koi Haime Musou comes out as well, from Yeti.
2878224	2878724	That's Hime.
2879124	2879424	My bad.
2880805	2883847	Remember, that's part of the reason why I do this, because I butcher all the Japanese names.
2883887	2884227	It means princess.
2884247	2884607	It's wonderful.
2885262	2886443	Oh, goody, another Princess game.
2887364	2891748	Hey, this is probably the game that most folks are waiting for, not just in Japan, but in the U.S.
2891848	2897594	On the Nintendo DS this week, Chrono Trigger finally hits on November 20th, so keep an eye out for that.
2898094	2901277	And with that comes a whole lot of accessories from Hori.
2902739	2909045	New pouches in different colors, a new little cleaning cloth thing, as well as a couple other games.
2910586	2920875	Tomica Hero Rescue Force, Touch and Direct from Sega, and a game called DS Recording Diet comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.
2922174	2927695	And lastly, over on the PSP, checking out what releases we have there this week.
2927755	2930876	It's not quite as busy of a week in Japan as it is in other parts of the world.
2932657	2935297	Ratchet & Clank, or as they call it, Clank & Ratchet.
2935937	2938958	Maruhi Mission Ignition comes out on the PSP this week.
2939418	2944179	As well as, again, Hori is also putting out some cases and things for the Sony PSP.
2944619	2947780	Otherwise, you have All-Star Yaken 2 Portable.
2948380	2951041	And, wait for it, Mobile Suit Gundam!
2952145	2960823	That's right, another Mobile Suit Gundam game Gundam vs. Gundam, and it even comes with its own PSP pack if you want to check that out Is that like a Gundam remake of Spy vs. Spy?
2961224	2962867	No My friend calls it Gundam
2964457	2965858	Also, I think this is kind of neat.
2965878	2971960	I think it's like a Disgaea spinoff because a game has come out all about Prinnies this week on the PSP.
2972060	2977382	Prinnie, Ore ga Shujinku de Inisuka comes out this week.
2977462	2979583	I think you can be a hero too or something like that.
2980084	2982344	It's coming out in the US too in February.
2982885	2985466	You get 1,000 lives in this game.
2986686	2990088	It's a side-scroller action game and your character has literally 1,000 lives.
2991388	2992831	I hope it's really hard, because that'd be funny.
2993051	2993672	It must be.
2994413	2997719	But, you know, printies were kind of disposable in Disgaea, so that is kind of funny.
2997739	3001225	That actually sounds like kind of a funny game, so you might have to check that one out.
3002452	3002952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3023800	3024901	Let's move on with some other gaming news.
3042242	3044224	Well, this is particularly exciting stuff.
3044284	3050188	Speaking of other release dates, Street Fighter 4 has a date for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3051769	3054931	Actually, you're saying that it's going to be February 20th, 2009.
3056813	3065699	So there's also some reports saying that there's going to be 25 characters in the console release and maybe some other fun stuff.
3066059	3066780	So who knows?
3068953	3070654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3098373	3099494	Sunnyvale Golfland
3117091	3117952	I'm sure we're going to see it.
3118612	3119972	It is popping up around the U.S.
3120252	3121072	Folks are importing it.
3121113	3124573	I think some of our New York listeners called in several weeks ago to talk about it.
3125254	3128375	It's just kind of sad it's not getting an official quote-unquote release in the U.S.
3128675	3129135	Who cares?
3129155	3130955	It doesn't really stop a lot of people nowadays.
3132036	3133676	Maybe because it's coming out on the consoles.
3133916	3136357	When games come out on consoles, it kind of kills the arcade release.
3137797	3139758	Unless it's Derby Owner's Club or DDR.
3141036	3141996	You can do it, right?
3142036	3155681	I mean, if developers are smart enough to incorporate things that you can tie into consoles, like, for example, DDR with edit data or, you know, F-Zero GX with, you know, data that you can port to the arcade and that kind of stuff.
3156401	3159262	I think if they do it smart, both can benefit from it.
3161795	3163536	All right, well, hey, Street Fighter fans.
3163596	3168159	If you are a hardcore Street Fighter fan, you've got to be a really hardcore Street Fighter fan to appreciate this.
3168359	3174223	Or if you just like bad movies like me, you're going to be excited that Street Fighter the movie is coming out on Blu-ray.
3174643	3175464	Yes, that's right.
3175564	3183649	The Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul Julia, and most importantly, Kylie Minow as Cammy Street Fighter movie is coming out on Blu-ray.
3184109	3187171	It's an extreme edition of the Street Fighter movie.
3187671	3187791	And...
3188612	3191413	It's so sad but true that this is Raul Julia's last movie.
3192134	3193374	But you can experience it one more time.
3193414	3194775	He actually was the best thing about the movie.
3195155	3196836	I even remember this 20 years later.
3197396	3199337	Well, not quite that much, but like 15, 20 years later.
3199637	3202279	But he was the best thing about that movie and the rest of it was complete cheeseball.
3202299	3202919	Cammy was great.
3203599	3204000	That's true.
3204260	3205260	Kylie Minogue was pretty awesome.
3205280	3206461	It was pretty great to see her in the movie.
3206801	3234945	I think the reason that this movie's coming out now or soon, I guess Well, to tie in with all the other Street Fighter crap Well, yes, and also to make it seem like that the new movie isn't as bad as it really is, because you watch this movie and you see the new movie and you're like, holy crap, that's awesome you know, whereas the average person who's seen it can go yeah not great Very good point It's like, thank god it's not thank god it didn't kill any good actors in this one
3236511	3245354	I will say this though, and not to spoil anything about the movie, but the very last thing in the entire movie, the little pose they all do at the very end, is by far the best part.
3246534	3250175	Because it's so fucking cheesy.
3250235	3255177	Good question from Frisbee in chat, chat.orange.radio.com Can we expect Street Fighter, the movie, the game?
3256161	3256641	I don't think so.
3257482	3265327	Considering some of the people who were in development of that game have come out and now spoken about why the game was such crap, I don't think you're ever going to see that game again.
3265347	3268749	I think that's the type of thing they've kind of swept under the rug and would like to leave there.
3269870	3271911	So thanks for reminding them of such painful memories.
3272112	3276695	If you want to play Street Fighter, the movie, the game, you just need to go find MAME.
3278476	3282979	SSJ100Matt says, they are making that Street Fighter the later years into a TV show.
3286052	3286312	DarkSakura.com
3312441	3317064	Well, I would do it if my email would pull up, so just give me a second.
3317784	3318184	There we go.
3318784	3319145	Woohoo.
3319505	3323167	We have a stunning total of one email.
3326368	3326908	And it comes.
3327289	3332532	By the way, as a reminder, that email address is mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to give DarkSakura some work to do.
3332852	3333913	Yes, it is.
3334654	3336195	So this comes from Geekboy.
3337255	3341038	Hey guys, for episode 300 I sent an email and you asked how old I am.
3341578	3344000	My 13th birthday is going to be on the 23rd.
3344640	3345901	Yes, my parents know I listen.
3345941	3346601	Don't freak out.
3347482	3349684	So SakuraMax beat that fatality.
3351545	3352205	This is Jamie.
3352245	3356068	I'm on Twitter, so please give me the JSRF soundtrack info on there.
3356628	3360770	And yes, I know I have typed this horribly, but I am too lazy to type slowly.
3360890	3361271	Sorry.
3361831	3363192	This is Orange Lounge!
3363232	3364333	Exclamation points a lot.
3365553	3365753	Done.
3367795	3368055	All right.
3369976	3374259	I would just be happier if you actually... Dude, you spelled just, like, everything right.
3374759	3378361	So why not try just using your shift key to capitalize stuff, okay?
3379222	3379522	All right.
3381097	3383159	Pyramid Head is inferior Pyramid Head is inferior
3410558	3412839	That's a pretty controversial statement right there on this program.
3412859	3413839	Pyramid Head is inferior.
3414200	3417601	Pyramid Head may be near and dear to many of your hearts, but I mean no ill will.
3418061	3422023	If anything, I want to expose everyone to something more creepy and superior.
3422863	3431527	Games with a horror theme may have their most memorable monsters and moments, but I believe that there is one out there to best them all, and it comes from Earthbound.
3432067	3434088	Yes, the old Super Nintendo game with Ness in it.
3434508	3439370	Before I continue, I'd like to put up the old spoiler warning here since what I'm referring to is the final boss of Earthbound.
3441994	3450617	At the end of Earthbound, Ness faces Giygas, an enemy that has been inhabited by the very manifestation of evil and has become a formless, swirling mass of red and black.
3451137	3453938	As the fight progresses, Giygas becomes more erratic and unsettling.
3454238	3458459	The fight itself is disturbing even by today's standards, and it's a Super Nintendo game to boot.
3458959	3467361	The parallax sprite of Giygas has a fetus in it, the audio in the fight is the actual boss itself, and Giygas' speech is just plain creepy.
3467701	3469542	Truly an experience in itself.
3470402	3473226	Here's a little clip of actually what that might look like.
3478753	3481216	That's actually a little creepy sound that Giygas makes.
3484941	3485842	That is a little bit creepy.
3487352	3494600	And if that wasn't bad enough, consider the fact that there is complete leftover data for a potentially creepier rematch against Giygas in Mother 3.
3495121	3500267	What was found was a sequence of imagery that gets progressively disturbing as the fight would have progressed if one were to play it.
3500928	3502309	Wouldn't you get freaked out?
3503130	3509531	If you were fighting the hollow red outline image of a dead relative's face with pupil-less eyes and mouth gaping wide open, right.
3509891	3512392	And there's audible speech for this iteration of Giygas.
3515072	3516793	This is kind of creepy, all things considered.
3517433	3523174	Anyhow, even if you never play Earthbound, I implore the listeners to set aside a few minutes to watch these amazingly How's that spelled?
3523434	3524874	frightening experiences.
3524974	3531936	G-I-Y-G-A-S Search for Earthbound's Giygas Final Battle and Lucas Nightmare on YouTube.
3532296	3532556	Greeny.
3536533	3537093	So there you have it.
3548536	3549016	No, I don't know.
3549036	3551558	You can put Giygas in the next Smash Bros.
3551598	3551838	game.
3551858	3552479	There you go.
3552579	3553039	There you go.
3553059	3553900	That's what I'm talking about.
3553940	3556081	I want a horror all-stars game.
3556341	3556741	There you go.
3556861	3558042	We'll put him in Smash Bros.
3558342	3563306	and then it'll piss fans off even more because you had another character from Earthbound and they're not bringing it over here.
3565567	3566748	It's like what they did with Kid Icarus.
3567488	3567728	All right.
3567909	3569670	Anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's Mailbag.
3569710	3572391	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us more emails.
3572431	3574653	It's like, oh, you won a Kid Icarus game, did you?
3574733	3575894	Well, one's coming.
3577450	3582673	and someday, maybe, I don't know.
3582693	3589937	So Activision, you know, since they are going to be planning on making a lot of Guitar Hero games, needs some more developers to help them with that.
3590157	3594260	So they have acquired Budcat to do that.
3594380	3602344	And Budcat Creations, the studio that has been responsible for all Guitar Hero titles on PlayStation 2 since Guitar Hero 3 is...
3604165	3607847	is currently in development of a new game in the Guitar Hero franchise.
3609928	3613431	And one guess would be that it's Guitar Hero Metallica.
3615031	3615392	Hmm.
3616272	3629140	And it says with Neversoft at the helm, Budkaz working on PS2, and Vicarious Visions will be responsible for the Wii and DS versions of whatever the next game will be.
3631092	3638814	and Budcat also just worked on, I guess, a Wii game that just came out on the WiiWare service, Our House, which was published by Majesco.
3639034	3639974	In the middle of the street?
3640874	3641254	Our House?
3642895	3643115	Yes.
3643335	3643735	Never mind.
3644115	3644535	I don't know.
3644635	3652577	Is there really a lot of development that needs to go into Guitar Hero Metallica?
3652737	3653437	Apparently.
3653737	3656358	Other than putting note charts together and
3658907	3659147	Maybe?
3659167	3660950	Well, they have to make it so uniquely different.
3661231	3664297	You know, just like how Guitar Hero Aerosmith was so different from Guitar Hero 3.
3664738	3669968	Yeah, you know, we do need to create the exaggerated models of the Metallica band members.
3671448	3678315	Well, hey, it's interesting that Budcat is kind of being assimilated into the Acty Blizzard empire, but what can you do?
3679796	3688945	More interesting stuff coming out for Guitar Hero, an official Gene Simmons brand Axe guitar coming out for not just Guitar Hero, but Rock Band as well.
3689245	3689445	Sweet.
3689725	3690847	It's a wireless guitar.
3691007	3693771	It looks like a freaking axe, not the deodorant.
3693871	3699278	I'm talking about like I'm going to chop you in half type axe, which actually looks pretty fucking sweet.
3699598	3701801	It's coming out November 15th for $80.
3701881	3703924	I'll waste my money on that.
3704064	3705967	That date just passed, so it's already out now.
3706027	3706487	It's coming out for $80.
3707426	3712630	It is compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 versions of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
3712950	3715332	The little controller actually will work with both.
3716013	3721317	It uses a little dongle to get the signal there.
3721417	3727102	Apparently, the actual guitar is like a three-quarter size official replica of the official Gene Simmons Axe guitar.
3727462	3730504	Now, unfortunately, this guitar will only work for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2.
3731205	3734968	If you are an Xbox 360 owner, you have to wait until April of 2009.
3737133	3741274	If you're a Wii owner, January 31st is when you get your version of the guitar.
3741294	3744715	So I don't know why Xbox 360 owners have to wait so much longer, but there you go.
3746255	3746615	Whatever.
3746635	3751196	They got, like, what, the Mad Catz bass guitar.
3751236	3754857	Well, as if there wasn't a million different guitars out there already, right?
3755537	3758117	But I have to admit, this one does look pretty freaking sweet.
3758397	3762978	And I do need a new guitar, but I play the games on the Xbox 360, so... Well, I'll tell you what, Rob.
3763018	3765199	Speaking of guitars, this has nothing to do with it.
3765319	3765559	Okay.
3768752	3770373	I'm going to throw that ferret in a fireplace.
3770753	3772094	Yeah, you say that all the time.
3772175	3772555	Have you?
3772655	3772975	No.
3773175	3775217	The ferret is undefeatable.
3775957	3779380	You know what's funny is that in Wii Music you have all these obscure things, right?
3779420	3781681	You have cheerleaders, triangles, cowbell, right?
3781721	3782142	All that stuff.
3782502	3784243	Why don't we have ferret in Wii Music?
3784724	3786445	That might have made the game sell more copies.
3786525	3787085	Think about it, Nintendo.
3787105	3788747	That would be the OLR edition of Wii Music.
3788907	3789387	Think about it.
3789927	3790548	Alright, moving on.
3792346	3802134	Samba de Amigo is going to be on mobile phones.
3802514	3814383	It will actually be with T-Mobile and AT&T phones, which pretty much spells out iPhone for me since I think T-Mobile has the iPhone now too, right?
3814824	3815244	Or was it?
3817798	3820500	Well, I think in other countries they do, but not here.
3821501	3823382	But also, T-Mobile has their sidekick too.
3824282	3826023	So basically those nice big screens.
3826784	3830286	But Samba de Amigo is going to be coming out for T-Mobile and AT&T phones.
3831967	3833228	That's going to be pretty cool.
3833628	3837310	It's, I mean, basically just Samba de Amigo.
3838311	3844014	But you're not going to really have it being all fun and Morocco-y.
3844975	3846196	I think you just shake the phone.
3847796	3854923	I was going to say, I mean, how much can you really replicate the experience of Samba de Amigo on a friggin' cell phone?
3855263	3856564	That's what I don't get, you know?
3856624	3857545	It's a little silly to me.
3858306	3863891	Well, I might have to try it, but that's just to see exactly how it works.
3864972	3865793	So, who knows?
3866754	3871078	I don't see any kind of a date on it or anything yet, but just keep looking if you care.
3872259	3872920	Maybe I don't care.
3874659	3875819	Yeah, you can show right over there.
3875919	3876879	That was how little I cared.
3879720	3880060	Alright.
3880760	3889042	Well, we asked our listeners tonight in a little segment we're now going to call Show Us Your Twits on Twitter what they thought about the Samba de Amigo game.
3889302	3891322	I need music for the Show Us Your Twits segment.
3891723	3892483	I don't have any music.
3892643	3893443	I need to get some music.
3893623	3894423	Find something porny.
3895343	3896063	Let's see what I can find.
3896124	3896364	Hold on.
3897064	3898144	Digging out some music.
3898184	3901025	What do you guys think the listeners said while I tried to dig out some music here?
3901445	3902905	I think they said burrito.
3905322	3908124	Bean Burrito, Chimichanga.
3908805	3911947	Let's see if I can find live radio folks.
3912567	3913988	How about now you're a man?
3914789	3915149	I don't know.
3915549	3916830	That's not appropriate.
3917711	3918652	Inappropriate.
3919512	3920053	Let's see.
3920413	3921954	Okay, here we go.
3922014	3923615	It has a line about big titties in it.
3924636	3925297	Here we go, here we go.
3926097	3926678	Let's try this again.
3926878	3929720	We're going to go to a segment now we call Show Us Your Twits.
3938796	3943507	Let's see, 13xforever says, Nope, played just fine with my iPhone.
3946705	3949546	DJ Tyron says, could be fun for a few minutes on the iPhone.
3949566	3951126	I don't see it being really worth it though.
3951186	3953207	Music games generally suck on mobile.
3954447	3958449	Dark Tetsuya says, even if I were into mobile gaming, probably not.
3958849	3961670	Half the gameplay is shaking the maracas and you don't get that on a mobile.
3962250	3968672	Deekman says, after the Wii version's crappy controls and no support on the console release, I'm not expecting anything Sega does to be good anymore.
3969972	3974134	MistyOLR says, hell, I'll probably check it out if Verizon decides to make it work on my phone.
3975518	3979200	Actdeft says, Samba de Amigo without maracas ain't Samba de Amigo.
3979961	3981842	GS68 says, I don't play mobile games.
3981902	3983022	I have a DS and a PSP.
3983923	3985464	Marin Marvel says, probably not.
3985624	3990067	I think it would be hard to emulate a game like that and make it as fun as the original in a mobile phone version.
3990507	3991988	Well, unless it was on the iPhone, maybe.
3992688	3993489	Still, probably not.
3995409	3997310	Crows says, ew, mobile games?
3997490	4000191	Dem fancy cell phones were made for phone calls, nothing else.
4000571	4002972	For gaming, they're probably even weaker than Game Boy Advance.
4003552	4008613	Well, Tipo says, sure, why not take a game beloved for its peripherals and put it out on mobile phones?
4008953	4010494	What's next, Steel Battalion?
4012114	4019760	and lastly, Geekboy says, I never had the chance to play the original because I was too young, but I wouldn't buy this in case I ever do get the chance to.
4019800	4021101	I don't want to ruin the experience.
4021481	4022842	My cell phone is really crappy.
4022882	4023622	I want an iPhone.
4023662	4025404	If anybody wants to give me one, contact me.
4025424	4027925	I'll sell you mine for $400.
4027966	4028886	There you go.
4028926	4029587	Show us your twits.
4029847	4030888	If you want to follow us on Twitter,
4032202	4033643	OLR is our username on Twitter.
4034083	4037346	And you can answer questions and show us your twits every Sunday night here.
4037366	4038547	I'll sell mine autographed for $400.
4038587	4041849	Well, we autographed it, but it wore off.
4043251	4043951	Alright, let's move on.
4043991	4044371	Gaming news.
4045352	4045973	Do we gotta?
4046673	4050416	Yes, because we're almost to the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
4050856	4051877	And we have an interview tonight.
4052217	4053138	Aaron from Snake360.
4053318	4054179	I know it's a busy show tonight.
4054199	4054879	We gotta keep it moving.
4054939	4055380	I know.
4056512	4065796	Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band are both getting brand new songs from the new Killers album, Day and Age.
4066716	4075720	And it's originally thought to only be debuting on Guitar Hero World Tour, but of course the MTV came out to say, hey, that's not true.
4076621	4081503	So there's going to be a three-song track pack available day and date with the new album.
4082483	4084204	And it will be available for...
4086578	4092060	Guitar Hero World Tour for 440 Microsoft Points or 549 on the PlayStation 3.
4092900	4102463	Also, each song will be available individually for 160 Microsoft Points, $1.99 on PS3, and actually on the Nintendo Wii for 200 points a pop.
4103143	4105024	And then for Rock Band...
4106568	4110713	I'll be releasing, I guess, alongside with the thing as well.
4111854	4118981	And no word on price or if they're going to just be doing like a three-song pack that says it looks like they're going to feature...
4123371	4125093	Yeah, it looks like it also might be the same.
4125454	4126915	Oh, three different songs from there.
4127616	4138549	Whereas Guitar Hero World Tour had Human and Losing Touch, Rock Band 2's got Mr. Right Side alongside with Smile Like You Mean It.
4140072	4141593	and I guess both of them get day and age.
4142414	4143435	The Killers are pretty cool.
4143535	4144035	I approve.
4144876	4147217	That's one of the songs I really like to sing in SingStar.
4148098	4151821	Which, by the way, SingStar is kind of an underrated karaoke game.
4151861	4156344	It really does add to the party atmosphere to have the original videos playing in the background.
4156364	4159806	I gotta say, all things considered, the SingStore, I know I'm totally getting off track, but I don't care.
4160127	4161428	The SingStore works pretty well.
4161988	4163649	I actually did play that game a little bit this week.
4163949	4165811	We actually downloaded some of the stuff from SingStore.
4166331	4173584	Paula Abdul Opposites Attract with the video and it's actually a duet and you can choose to sing Paula's part or MC Scat Cat.
4174465	4174786	Awesome.
4175988	4179434	Just wanted to say that even though it has nothing to do with the killers but it made me think of that.
4180703	4183004	Anyhow, back to Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
4183384	4185145	Some other download stuff coming out very soon.
4185225	4189247	Rock Band is going to be getting the Dead Kennedys, a three-pack of Dead Kennedys songs.
4189527	4193428	California Uber Al's, not Allies, but Al's.
4193869	4195890	Holiday in Cambodia, you know that song.
4195950	4198211	Police Truck coming out in a three-pack.
4198331	4200251	Mission of Burma also getting a three-pack.
4200932	4204773	Micah, That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate and That's When I Reached for My Revolver.
4205114	4205694	I like that song.
4206774	4209255	Century Media Girls of Metal three-pack.
4209515	4212676	It's two songs from Lacuna Coil and one song from In This Moment.
4213476	4217738	And then one more individual song coming out this week from Crooked X, a song called Gone.
4218578	4222459	Guitar Hero, not to be outdone, is also releasing some songs this week.
4222519	4227421	Not quite as much, but they did land a pretty big-name artist, Jimi Hendrix.
4228101	4229822	A Hendrix track pack is out this week.
4229962	4234584	If Six Was Nine, Little Wing, and Fire live from Woodstock.
4235144	4235724	That's pretty hot.
4237355	4238536	So check those out.
4238776	4241417	You can either get something modern there in Rock Band or something.
4241457	4249481	Well, I guess it's not all modern, though, because some of those other songs were kind of like 80s punk, but pretty good diverse selection between the two games this week.
4250886	4265896	Also to diversify your gaming week, DarkSakura is here to pick a game from the archives and dub it as her classic video game of the week because you kids need to respect your elder games and check out an old school game once in a while.
4266236	4276663	And even though DarkSakura has kind of had some newer choices as of late, like last week was Symphony of the Night and you can kind of play that on the newer consoles, tonight's pick, going back to the very, very old school, right DarkSakura?
4278204	4279345	That it is.
4280922	4287346	The game of the week is Wizards and Warriors, which is the game that I played a shit ton of.
4287947	4288387	Me too.
4288527	4289848	I love Wizards and Warriors.
4289888	4290508	Let's take a listen.
4291049	4291549	The map.
4291569	4292029	The map.
4306863	4310065	I like the music that it plays when you go inside one of the little rooms in the trees.
4310465	4310765	Right here.
4312086	4318229	Alright, tell us a little more about Wizards and Warriors.
4318489	4326473	Wizards and Warriors, you play as this dude named Kuros, who is wearing full plate armor, unlike the box.
4327540	4330701	where he's dressed up as Conan the Barbarian, go fig.
4331161	4335383	Hi, 80's Nintendo artwork was awesome.
4335623	4336563	Bite my big toe.
4337484	4338924	Damn inaccurate bastards.
4340325	4341305	Making men look like that.
4341465	4344766	Anyway, so you start off in the forest.
4345687	4349308	The forest is wonderful and beautiful and scary and deadly.
4349688	4351949	Full of spiders and creatures and thingies.
4352389	4353990	But you can go inside trees.
4355137	4378059	and the trees have doors and they make special noise every time you open the door and you get this cool music and suddenly the trees have like special things that you can jump on and spiders to kill so um um you basically are going through the game and you can get treasure chests that like if you find the ones with gems in it it says thou hast discovered gems
4379476	4380136	There it was right there.
4380196	4381897	That has discovered Dagger of Throwing.
4382597	4385578	The Dagger of Throwing is so freaking useful.
4386519	4387359	I remember that game.
4387859	4388900	This game was awesome.
4389340	4395202	But you can also get potions and food as your healing items, weapons, and tools.
4396223	4396283	Um...
4397563	4404826	You have unlimited continues, and basically the only problem of dying is that your score gets reset to zero.
4405726	4410008	So the main guy has a sword or an axe and a shield.
4412829	4416850	However, in the sequel, you can actually choose to pick an element and then...
4422572	4423592	Go through the game like that.
4424293	4429634	I'm not really going to talk too much about the other versions because they were inferior in comparison to the first one.
4432215	4436357	But it's like, why couldn't they get him to look right on the cover?
4436797	4437817	I'm sorry for going back to that.
4437877	4438577	It's still bothering me.
4438657	4444459	DarkTetsuya wants to point out, don't forget the sequel, Iron Sword, that that box art actually had Fabio on it.
4444939	4446840	Yeah, I remember that.
4447020	4449661	But that also made the game slightly inferior.
4452054	4455195	So, um, but I mean really the game is very simple.
4455436	4466961	You just go through all the different stages and you have to, um, basically you have to keep unlocking, um, rescuing these women throughout the level until you rescue the princess.
4467081	4468541	I always like to think of them as wenches.
4470182	4471763	They were being held up by ropes.
4473204	4478366	Um, now the thing, there is a trick with this game.
4479864	4489471	And the big trick with this game is that if you go through the different levels and keep picking up however many, what was it?
4489731	4492473	I think it was the different keys you needed, wasn't it?
4494514	4509484	You can actually, if you go back into the second forest level, which is basically after you do the underground and come back up, there's actually a way to do a series of jumps to where you will jump over pretty much the screen divider back into the first level of forest.
4510865	4512646	And you can play through the game again.
4512967	4514968	And you'll actually beat the game halfway through the game.
4515749	4517810	Because you'll just have all the number of items you need.
4518271	4521513	And the princess will just be left there going, uh, dude, where are you?
4522614	4525156	So you actually don't have to fight the final boss to beat the game.
4525496	4527198	You can just glitch the game out hardcore.
4529818	4537203	The bad guy, Malkill, was also in an episode of Captain N, the Game Master.
4538144	4538944	Freaking stupid show.
4539385	4541326	It was in the Nightmare on Mother Brain Street.
4542607	4542807	Nice.
4544691	4551720	and the world, in the game it was called the Kingdom of Elrond, in the show it was called Excalibur for some reason.
4552020	4553462	Can I just say something completely random?
4553482	4559929	I'm watching the video of this guy playing Wizards and Warriors, and the little beehives that the bees come out of look like poop.
4560570	4561111	Yes, they do.
4562352	4563273	I call them shit bees.
4564294	4564495	Nice.
4566473	4574760	Also, Kurose, the main guy, he was in a show called The Power Team, and they made him look like He-Man.
4576175	4599541	But now this is one cool thing, and I wasn't quite aware of this, but the Wizards and Warriors story was turned into a book called Worlds of Power, a different series of novels for young children, and it was about a boy named Matthew who was trying to use his imagination creatively and instead brings his father's night figure to life and has to go help fight the battle.
4604073	4605534	But that's just the story.
4606075	4606996	Anyway, I love this game.
4607176	4608497	I hate every other version after it.
4608677	4609998	So, the end.
4611299	4613501	Wizards and Warriors is your classic game of the week.
4613601	4616584	Check it out if you happen to own a Nintendo.
4616624	4617384	I like this music too.
4620707	4621228	Well done.
4621288	4623350	Thou hast rescued... What was her name?
4623910	4625471	Lucinda, the distressed damsel.
4625952	4626252	500 points.
4626352	4628194	And conveniently, she's wearing a bikini.
4628934	4629235	Who knew?
4629595	4630596	Maybe she's a harem girl.
4631326	4633387	Wizards and Warriors is your classic game of the week.
4633427	4637328	We're going to use this opportunity to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but we'll be right back.
4637408	4638449	Don't go anywhere.
4638949	4644931	We still have Aaron to bring on from the game Snake 360, which is coming out with the new Xbox experience this week.
4645331	4654674	And we have your phone calls and the FUs of the week and some news about LittleBigPlanet and some other things coming up in Part B. So don't go anywhere, darn it.
4654974	4656995	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4664127	4670269	And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 16th of 2008.
4670309	4673511	I'm sorry I'm laughing, which isn't going to make much sense to the podcast listeners.
4673911	4685235	But during the breaks when we were taping this live on Sunday nights at allgames.com, we like to just play some music for about 10 minutes just to give ourselves a chance to rest, use the restroom, take a break, and our live listeners to do the same.
4685515	4687216	So we play some music from assorted video games.
4687656	4693078	And one of the music we was playing there during the break was Super Mario... Did I just say we was playing?
4693918	4694659	Super Mario Bros.
4694679	4695800	We was out there playing.
4696100	4697561	We was playing something old school.
4697601	4699983	No, we were playing the theme music from Super Mario Bros.
4700243	4699983	2.
4700603	4701604	And I can play a clip of it.
4701644	4703445	Playing clips of songs is okay on podcasts.
4703485	4704266	I just can't play the whole thing.
4704586	4705487	You know the old school song?
4708229	4711611	And DarkSakura comes in here and starts singing Dookie over all the lyrics.
4712352	4714413	Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dookie.
4714473	4717996	So I started singing along too and then it went Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dook, Poop.
4719116	4721418	And then we just started busting up because we're like five years old.
4721718	4722219	Alright, anyway.
4723542	4727744	Look, let's get back to... And Frisbee says, dookie dookie panic.
4728985	4731266	That's a Mario Brothers 2 joke, isn't it?
4731386	4732706	I thought that was a funny joke.
4733767	4734467	All right, anyhow.
4735188	4735868	Let's move on.
4735908	4742071	We're going to get back into some gaming news here during this Part B. You guys are going to call us a little later on with your phone calls and interview.
4742291	4744072	Aaron Teplitsky is going to be joining us.
4744132	4745532	Snake360.
4745572	4747613	And you can see the teasers at snake360.com.
4748994	4757876	It's like the old school Snake from the cell phones, but like camera angles and color and multiplayer and goals and modes galore.
4758216	4758956	It's nuts.
4759637	4761437	We'll talk all about it with Aaron here very soon.
4761477	4763157	But first, some more gaming news.
4763297	4763537	Loki.
4763838	4769339	Yes, the recently released Banjo-Kazooie game, Nuts and Bolts, has...
4770888	4776013	A little bit of a problem if you have an older TV, or an older TV that also happens to be very small.
4776414	4783701	Apparently the in-game text is too small to see on some standard definition television sets.
4784362	4792991	And originally Rare had said that they weren't going to fix the problem, that it would be too expensive in terms of time, resources, and money to alter.
4794226	4799310	The company has now gone back on that word and said that they will have a fix within the next 30 days.
4799990	4803253	Which just goes to show you if the internet bitches enough, it will get its way.
4803653	4805194	Well, it can't be that hard.
4805254	4809237	I mean, after all, Dead Rising had the same problem and the same fix.
4809458	4811379	So, come on guys.
4811779	4813641	It's just like, what, editing a font?
4814481	4814922	Seriously?
4816890	4822473	I imagine though, from the developer's perspective, getting these patches out there has got to be a pain in the ass.
4822973	4835859	But, to be fair though, all games that are published on the 360 are supposed to go through a process where they actually test them on a standard definition 14-inch TV.
4836599	4843322	And the text has to be readable on that, and it has to play well, look right, and all that sort of stuff.
4843882	4844142	So the...
4845863	4846404	I have no idea.
4873567	4876548	How this gets missed or approved, you know what I mean?
4877548	4889251	Well, seeing that, in my memory, it's only been two games really so far that have had this issue, I think that the precautions and the steps are in place to make sure this doesn't happen.
4889551	4898234	I think that maybe they were trying to rush the game out to the market and didn't quite have time to go back and fix said problem with game.
4899255	4900396	Until after the fact.
4900476	4903278	And at first they said, oh, let's see if no one notices.
4903438	4905820	And, you know, sure enough, people noticed.
4905880	4908302	And they're like, ah, let's see if they're fine with us not fixing it.
4908322	4909402	And sure enough, people weren't.
4909603	4910603	So now they have to do it.
4911884	4912124	All right.
4912144	4916608	Well, speaking of Banjo-Kazooie, Loki has been able to hook us up with...
4917694	4920435	This right here, I'm holding in my hot little hand on Justin TV.
4920455	4923996	If you guys can see that there, if you're on the radio, you unfortunately cannot see it.
4924417	4933300	But what this is, this is a code for you to download the original Banjo-Kazooie game on Xbox Live absolutely free.
4933760	4934201	Free!
4934621	4937204	And we're going to be giving that away next week on the show.
4938045	4941488	A popular game is coming back that we haven't played here on the show in a long time.
4941708	4946994	One vs. the Chat Room is going to be played next week, and this code is going to be given away to a lucky winner.
4947915	4953120	So even if you didn't pre-order the brand new Banjo-Kazooie game, you can still get your hot little hands on the old school one on Xbox Live.
4953561	4954382	We're going to be giving that away.
4954922	4955943	Just because we love ya!
4956769	4957249	There you have it.
4957829	4959930	So next week, be here for one versus the chat room.
4960370	4962251	Sadly, I'm sorry podcast listeners.
4962791	4965232	It won't work out that we can give one away to you guys this week.
4965572	4968653	But I promise the next contest we do will be open to all.
4969053	4970214	That was satisfying, Rob.
4970614	4970794	What?
4970834	4971534	Hunting the chat room.
4971554	4973115	Getting up and getting to wave that.
4973395	4973775	There you have it.
4974560	4975980	All right, so stay tuned for that.
4976040	4979401	Meantime, we're going to move on to the PlayStation 3 and talking about LittleBigPlanet.
4979461	4982262	Man, what a mess LittleBigPlanet has suddenly become.
4982602	4983283	You know what?
4983503	4984743	I talked about this game last week.
4984783	4985723	This game is awesome.
4985763	4991645	I still love this game, but it sounds like moderation is really starting to get a little crazy there.
4992405	4995546	Sony apparently has laid out some rules this week.
4996046	5000888	Ensure the content you share with other users is suitable for all ages and everybody has access to your level if you publish it.
5001388	5003609	Please respect other people's intellectual property rights.
5003649	5006571	For example, don't use images, brands, or logos that you're not entitled to use.
5006952	5010274	And if you come across any content that you feel the need to report, then please do it responsibly.
5010594	5013095	Hoax reports will be considered inappropriate behavior.
5013616	5025043	Well, I don't know if this has made anything better for them to come out and clarify because apparently some really popular levels on LittleBigPlanet have been hit, including one called Azure Palace, which I haven't played myself, but apparently
5025083	5025323	It's awesome.
5025343	5027405	Apparently it's a very, very popular level.
5027465	5028365	One of the favorite.
5028666	5030547	It got hit for moderation this week, if you can believe it.
5031468	5034870	And they can't figure out why this game got hit for moderation.
5035210	5038332	Was it the blood splatters they had in the level that apparently were?
5038573	5039053	I don't know.
5040294	5041915	It gets worse than that, actually.
5041975	5043076	It's not just that one.
5043356	5048339	Many of the top levels have been hit with moderation, including the World of Color, which is another one.
5048379	5051001	Which, there is nothing copyright in World of Color.
5051021	5051642	I don't get that.
5052122	5052622	That is weird.
5052823	5055364	Well, the level creator of Azure Palace is pissed.
5055765	5057386	He made a comment, So, needless to say, uh...
5081824	5099148	Whoever is pulling these levels, Sony, Medium Molecule, whoever, I imagine it's Sony, whoever is pulling these levels is starting to bite the hand that feeds them a little bit because if you piss off all the people that are creating the great content for your game, there's not going to be much left but those, you know, win nine trophies in 30 second levels which get old fast.
5100852	5103774	It's really sad, though, because lots of levels are getting moderated.
5104935	5107576	Some, you know, maybe they're kind of borderline.
5107817	5111099	There's like that Tetris level that was sort of like Tetris, but not quite.
5111499	5112480	That got moderated.
5112540	5114681	That level was a lot of fun.
5115401	5123667	There's a bunch of other ones, but there's seriously a ton of threads on LittleBigWorkshop, the official website for LittleBigPlanet and stuff.
5124407	5124547	And...
5126007	5127128	You know, tons of stuff.
5127829	5133334	There's a 22 page post on there that's just going.
5133874	5135596	You know, and some of the things, like some of the comments.
5137168	5147975	There's a minigame actually in LittleBigPlanet in the Frozen Tundra world called Spline Rider where you get on a thin sled and slide around on a track.
5148836	5152578	Seems kind of familiar to a popular online game called Line Rider.
5152978	5159643	So it's okay for Media Monocle to go ahead and rip off other games but it's not okay for other people to do that.
5160573	5165215	and they actually have... And it's okay for them to have a strip club in the game, but heaven forbid you see a blood splatter.
5165235	5166315	You know those blood splatters?
5166555	5168196	Those are actually taken from the game.
5168256	5174398	They're in one of the Asian levels in there where there's blood splatters underneath these blades that are there.
5174798	5176538	So it's stuff that's in the game.
5177519	5178059	It's just...
5179336	5180357	Thank you for watching!
5196894	5197514	What's going to be left?
5227421	5228322	Thank you for watching!
5246095	5249639	then you can still make a copy of the original level again and re-upload it if you need to.
5249899	5257268	Also, if you want, one good thing if you think someone's going to kick your level offline, make it so that they can download a copy of your level as well.
5257328	5263555	You have that option on there so someone can actually save it, even put it in your comments to make sure you save the level when you're done.
5263835	5266558	You can actually save it to your moon and then it doesn't matter if it gets moderated.
5267158	5289089	and if anyone from Sony or Media Molecule happens to listen to this show because we do have some industry people that listen to this show but kind of keep quiet and they don't really let us know they're listening if anybody from either of those companies happens to listen to this show it is imperative you guys comment on the situation like this week I mean you can't let this keep going on much longer it is starting to snowball out of control it is imperative you get your legal department on the ball and say something quick
5289990	5293833	And the other thing too is because people aren't saying anything, people are thinking the worst.
5294114	5299039	Oh, are they going to steal my levels and use them in a download pack or something they're going to charge money for?
5299639	5300580	Oh, why are they doing this?
5302805	5303785	It's just ridiculous.
5304345	5313848	And the thing that's really ridiculous about it is, say you work 20 hours on a level and upload it and stuff like that, and they moderate it for some retarded reason, you can't re-upload it again.
5314068	5318330	So you can't really make a copy of it or do whatever with it.
5318610	5322371	And I seem to remember this comparison being made in the past, but GS68 makes it again tonight.
5322451	5326812	See, Blastworks has levels with copyrighted imagery, yet their staff doesn't mind that shit.
5327992	5329513	And nobody sued Blastworks yet.
5330646	5331506	Yeah, very interesting.
5332287	5335869	TigerClaw says, this could probably spark a global boycott of the game if they don't fix it.
5336669	5342532	I don't know so much about that because I think a lot of people that were going to... The games have already all been sold a lot of times.
5342552	5343212	You know what I mean?
5343272	5345113	Most people that were really eager about the game have already bought it.
5345753	5346914	YYR kind of follows up with that.
5346974	5348455	Global boycott will never happen.
5348755	5351336	It's as likely to happen as an internet petition meaning something.
5352148	5352548	The FUs of the Week
5388629	5390270	DarkSakura wants to start us off tonight.
5391691	5396956	F you to apathetic voters, as in people who don't vote.
5398617	5405282	I mean, really, there's people, well, actually, specifically, the people who complain about an issue and don't vote on it.
5406403	5415951	Because if you, if it doesn't mean enough to you to go out and make your voice heard, you know, at least by giving your vote to the issue, then you have no right to complain.
5417199	5422143	But like if somebody just abstains from voting for a school board member because they don't know anything about them.
5422203	5423664	I'm talking about big issues.
5423724	5425086	Yeah, I'm just saying though.
5426847	5432011	If it's something that's really not going to affect everything from day to day, that's one thing.
5432071	5434934	But if it's something like, oh, example, a civil rights issue.
5436395	5437836	Hmm, Alameda County.
5437856	5441639	Oh, I'm sorry, only 22% of them voted.
5441859	5442340	That's right.
5443689	5445130	Lazy asses.
5446671	5452335	But just make sure if it means something to you that instead of just bitching about it, you do something about it.
5454516	5454836	Loki!
5455777	5462561	F you to my place of employment for still not giving me a raise and for potentially making my job even harder.
5462902	5467965	My coworker is quitting here within the next couple weeks and
5469511	5494905	Unfortunately they're going to probably hire someone else to fill his spot and I'm going to get probably some of his bigger accounts and they're planning on giving me yet another really big account and it's just more work for me to do with no sort of compensation for it and it kind of sucks but their mentality is you don't like it, leave and unfortunately I've been there for almost 10 years and I would rather
5495726	5513677	I really just want to give an F you tonight to Noah's Bagels and their bagel dogs because they're so delicious and I can't stop eating them, especially now that, you know, after the gallbladders come out and my health is starting to get back to normal, thank God.
5514898	5517940	F you to those things for being so damn yummy and I know they're not good for you.
5520839	5526865	Sorry that my FU is a little more silly compared to some of the others tonight, but sometimes it's the little things.
5527926	5530969	All right, anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
5531069	5531889	DarkSakura.
5534092	5535193	The magic number is five.
5536194	5536934	What magic number?
5537134	5537635	I'm just kidding.
5537655	5538796	I thought three was a magic number.
5539657	5540918	That's what they told me on Schoolhouse Rock.
5541378	5540918	42.
5541539	5542299	Oh, I see.
5543561	5545863	Well, who's been looking forward to LocoRoco 2?
5548363	5550708	I never really got into LocoRoco1, but I'd check it out.
5550848	5551409	I would check it out.
5551489	5552772	LocoRoco is crack!
5554295	5555978	At any rate... Yes, ma'am.
5558684	5567431	On the online portal for the LocoRoco 2 site, there is actually a Flash minigame that you can play.
5567491	5578080	It's over on Spill Games' website, and it will be there until the 21st of November, so try it while you can, and download it while you can.
5578881	5580022	I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
5580782	5582083	But I will be linking the...
5584275	5610869	the site in the chat room however to go ahead and say this on the podcast it is at games.co.uk slash game slash loco roco 2.html so give it a try it's cute alrighty it's the cuteness there's some people are calling it in chat Loki Roco it's not Loki Roco
5611971	5612611	That's a cute name.
5612651	5613312	Loki Roko.
5614112	5615612	That's what we'll start calling him on this program.
5615792	5616193	Just kidding.
5616693	5617413	Loki Roko.
5618333	5624076	This rumor's been around before, but now it's coming into yet another venue, I guess.
5625716	5632639	Electronic Gaming Monthly, their usual quarterman segment of different rumors and speculations.
5633119	5637441	Well, he now has a rumor saying that LittleBigPlanet will be coming to the PSP in 2009.
5639741	5644322	I mean, it makes sense that they'll do that, and I think with actually the controls, it could work.
5644842	5646403	You could easily do that on there.
5646903	5653365	I don't know how it'd look, because the PSP obviously is not as powerful as, I don't know, the PlayStation 3.
5654745	5656706	But it's not being developed by Media Molecule, right?
5657506	5657666	No.
5659026	5661087	It seems that they are actually at the...
5662722	5663443	Oh yeah, that's right.
5663683	5664304	It won't have them.
5664665	5668569	Instead it's Sony Studio Liverpool.
5669070	5674036	We asked Media Molecule for comment and what they said is that they were going to moderate this game for being too similar to their own.
5675418	5676059	It's kind of a bummer.
5677901	5679483	They said, I am Spartacus.
5683961	5684281	Shut up.
5684701	5685001	All right.
5686242	5691486	No, it's no surprise, though, that they're going to hoard this franchise out into the ground, that there's a PSP version coming out.
5691746	5704194	It might actually be pretty cool, especially if, wait for this, especially if the levels you get, assuming this whole moderation thing gets figured out, if you could get the levels on your PS3 and transfer them to your PSP, that might be pretty awesome, actually.
5704915	5705315	Don't you think?
5707465	5707845	I don't know.
5708385	5709366	I don't know if it'd look right.
5710587	5712508	Because of the proportions and everything?
5712708	5716430	I can't imagine that they'd be able to do the same kind of quality on the PSP.
5716530	5718432	It's got to be scaled down quite a bit.
5719973	5720473	Well, we'll see.
5720493	5721233	I don't know about you guys.
5721273	5722194	It sounds pretty interesting to me.
5722674	5725856	Well, damn, the news will not just stop coming in about Burnout Paradise.
5725896	5726217	What was it?
5726397	5729279	Just last week we were talking about the awesome old school cars that were going to be in the game.
5729719	5735042	And now, apparently, toy cars are coming to Burnout Paradise.
5735502	5735723	You know...
5736664	5739246	Criterion, they're really awesome about this.
5739286	5741648	They're showing you how to keep the game alive.
5741708	5742288	It's great.
5742668	5747272	Well, now apparently they are going to be introducing tiny little collectible cars.
5747852	5753056	No idea if the cars themselves will be tiny in the game, but they all look like little Hot Wheels and they're pretty awesome.
5753376	5755017	Apparently there's nine cars in all.
5755117	5762182	Carson GT Concept P12, Krieger Racing WTR, Hunter Takedown 4x4 and Hunter Manhattan, so on and so on.
5763023	5765564	Apparently they're all going to come out next year and...
5766365	5766945	That's awesome.
5767366	5768906	Criterion just keeps supporting this game.
5768946	5770107	I love the monster truck.
5770167	5770867	That's going to be awesome.
5770907	5772428	This little purple one with flames on it.
5772888	5774189	They're putting hot wheels in the game.
5775029	5775630	Good for them.
5776310	5780312	That would be funny if you could actually drive the little cars around and they act like big cars.
5780812	5783674	You can smash through things and just pow, pow, pow.
5783694	5784614	Power wheels, pow, pow.
5784915	5785455	Alright, forget it.
5786776	5790497	That would be a preschooler driving a car around would be pretty awesome, don't you think?
5790698	5790958	I don't know.
5791894	5792954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5817900	5826043	It's a 21 year old and leads a raiding guild and the character is called Nim.
5827223	5828063	N-Y-M-H.
5830324	5835926	27 hours worth of leveling and being kept alive by a healer.
5836046	5840587	So Nim got all the experience and made it to 80.
5842247	5843128	And apparently...
5845134	5856585	The one right after was someone called Darius who was suspended by Blizzard at level 79 and bumped back to level 70 after using an exploit.
5857546	5858167	Oh, snap.
5859463	5865185	I want to know what the exploit was.
5865205	5865585	Grinding.
5865705	5866106	Interesting.
5866166	5868887	Grinding in a crypt in the Grizzly Hills area.
5869447	5870627	Wait a second.
5870827	5873448	Grinding is not an exploit.
5873468	5874929	No, he didn't get banned either.
5874969	5878210	No, Darius got banned.
5879210	5880671	Or rolled back or whatever you want to call it.
5881291	5882231	I wonder what that exploit was.
5882332	5883212	He got wall-marted.
5884673	5885394	He got moderated.
5885574	5886375	He got Walmarted.
5887055	5887616	Moderate!
5887856	5892560	Now, what makes this so notable is that, you know, it's supposed to take you, like, a month to get to 80.
5893321	5895523	You know, the game came out, what, Wednesday night?
5895943	5899246	I'm level 73, and I've been playing pretty hardcore.
5899346	5902649	Most people in my guild are only, like, 71, maybe 72.
5902889	5910556	Well, apparently this place that he was grinding at has a really high respawn rate, and monsters are neutral monsters.
5912370	5912971	Oh, interesting.
5913731	5915433	It's a crypt in the Grizzly Hills area.
5915913	5918975	Go spam it, everybody, and crash the server!
5919156	5922598	There's a lot of level one boars there, and he just kept killing them.
5923819	5925921	Solid Goomba comments and says, Mom!
5926602	5926962	Bathroom!
5928669	5930850	which must have been exactly what happened here with this guy.
5931291	5942318	No, you know, despite all the fun being made of this guy, the thing that he did that the rest of the people aren't doing, they obviously found this area in the beta, figured it would be a good area to go to.
5942378	5945120	When the game hit, they went straight to this area.
5945420	5954086	This was their sole intention, to gain XP as fast as possible, and with a Warlock of a certain spec, it's pretty easy to do if you have a dedicated healer, and did nothing but level.
5954346	5955247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5975933	5976834	Thank you for watching!
6003408	6014959	Anyhow, you know I've been playing Wrath of the Lich King quite a lot this week, but something that might actually be able to divert my attention away from Warcraft this next week is the release of the new Xbox Experience.
6015520	6019984	One thing we've been talking about a lot on this show is the addition of community games to the Xbox dashboard.
6020584	6022106	One of the games that is going to be coming...
6022706	6033610	Out is called Snake360, and it has an interesting tie-in to music-based video games, which we've been talking about a lot on this show, you know, previously in our history and anything.
6034051	6039573	Anyway, to join us on the show tonight to talk about Snake360 is its creator, Aaron Teplitsky.
6039853	6046055	We're going to get on the phones and get a hold of Aaron and talk to him a little bit about his new game, Snake360.
6046455	6047656	Well, hey, Aaron, are you there?
6048476	6049797	Yeah, I'm right here.
6050018	6051479	Alright, well welcome to the show.
6051539	6054101	Thanks so much for taking the time to be on Orange Lounge Radio this evening.
6054141	6055222	How you doing this Sunday night?
6056463	6057124	I'm doing great.
6057184	6058786	Thank you very much for having me on here.
6058826	6059787	I really appreciate it.
6060027	6060988	Awesome, not a problem.
6061028	6064631	Hey, we're all about, you know, the independent games as well as the big boys.
6064671	6068995	So tell us, your game is Snake 360, coming to the new Xbox 360 experience.
6069255	6070657	Tell us a little bit about Snake 360.
6071117	6072058	What is this game all about?
6073271	6079715	Well, basically what it is, it's similar to, you know, Snake games that you've probably seen before on cell phones, old computers, and whatnot.
6080255	6082236	But what it is is a complete reimagining.
6082756	6090921	Graphically, you know, it's got 3D graphics, it runs nice and smooth, and, you know, it has a very clean look.
6091041	6094583	It's a little boxy, but, you know, that's the way Snake is.
6094683	6099706	So, basically, you know, it's not...
6100620	6102961	You're not going to get a huge graphical masterpiece.
6103261	6104742	If you're looking for that, then you'll play Gears 2.
6105523	6109345	But what it lacks in graphics, it definitely makes up for in the gameplay department.
6109765	6113847	It's got classic gameplay and a whole wide range of levels.
6113967	6115668	They start ridiculously easy.
6115688	6117249	You've got your four walls, and that's it.
6117788	6120310	and then it goes up to insanely difficult.
6120530	6130456	If you like retro games, arcade games, just challenging games in general, you're going to get a lot of mileage out of Snake360, especially seeing as how it's got internet-based leaderboards.
6130976	6137120	You know, I think you're selling yourself a little bit short on the graphical ability of the game because, you know, sure, we all know the game Snake on cell phones.
6137180	6144584	It's, you know, a blocky game where you kind of go, but I noticed in watching the trailer on your website, Snake360.com, you kind of do all these little
6144884	6149386	Well you know, what I try and do is I throw in the instant replays and the
6163652	6170979	Camera effects from the different angles and part of it is functionality related because sometimes you want to view the whole level.
6171099	6176944	Sometimes you want a view of just you so you can line up better, get a view of your surroundings.
6177004	6179006	Maybe you want to zoom in, maybe you want to zoom out.
6179286	6181188	So part of it is just functionality related.
6181528	6184351	But also we've come to expect a lot of these things in games.
6184801	6199308	if you're in battle mode and you just cut the other guy off and surprise the heck out of him and everybody in the room is screaming and yelling you're going to want to watch that over and over and over again to rub it in his face so you've got the instant replay for that reason
6200788	6201208	Sounds great.
6201248	6204270	Well, now, I don't want to talk just about graphics.
6204310	6214177	Let's talk about music for a minute, because even though this game has nothing to do with arrow stomping or beat matching, I hear there's a connection in here for fans of dance music games, which we have a lot of at Orange Lounge.
6214897	6215578	What's the connection?
6215598	6227605	Yeah, well, actually, it turns out I was looking for music, and I'm no musician, so I went to Kyle Ward and John Mendenhall and their record label, SCI Recordings.
6227625	6229887	Their website right now is SCIREcordings.com.
6230763	6255912	and we struck a little bit of a deal and as it turns out players of the In The Groove series of games and also the more recent Pump Pro are going to find that they're familiar with a lot of the music in the game and we fleshed it out with some music that they won't be familiar with and in total there are nine of their songs in the game and I think that the players are going to really enjoy the soundtrack it's you know pumping you know get your blood moving and
6256750	6259052	Maybe cause you not to crash into a wall, I don't know.
6273557	6279123	Yeah, well, I'm really fond of the soundtrack, and I've been listening to it for months straight, working on the game, and I'm not sick of it yet.
6279263	6283488	So I guess that probably says that it might actually be working for the game.
6283888	6285650	So you mentioned you've been working on the game for months.
6285710	6291056	How long did things take from idea to where we are, the game's launching November 19th?
6292771	6294312	Well, I'll be quite honest with you.
6294352	6298436	Throughout 2007, I was thinking about this game constantly.
6298896	6304540	I'm working this little IT job for a non-profit, which is completely not the field that I want to be working in.
6305161	6307863	And just driving from place to place, I'd be thinking about it.
6307923	6312186	I'd be thinking, well, this is how I want this to work, and this is how I imagine this.
6312927	6319072	And towards the end of the year, with X and A out, I just said, well, why don't I take a stab at this?
6319634	6349121	and my original intent was to target Xbox Live Arcade and I actually submitted to them and it took them a long time to get back to me I don't know what happened with that but in the time between the time I submitted to them and the time they gave me the final answer they announced community games so I'm thinking yeah hey that's not a bad idea and then finally they came back and they said well we have limited space for casual action games on Xbox Live Arcade so we feel it's not a good fit at this time
6349778	6351980	So I'm like, well, you know, community games.
6352540	6353481	And that was back in March.
6354402	6358025	So starting in March, I started working on it, you know, more frequently.
6358846	6362268	I actually started, completely started last December.
6363389	6368333	That's when I just, you know, started from scratch with XNA and, you know, got a snake moving on the screen and whatnot.
6369434	6371616	And then I really took it into high gear in August.
6372076	6378722	So I really started about a year ago, but I'd say, you know, solid work is probably about seven months of work
6379375	6381857	All my spare time went into this game.
6382177	6384678	I know that was a long, convoluted answer, but yeah.
6384738	6385999	No, that's all right.
6386339	6392043	That's very interesting to kind of hear that you actually had submitted it originally as an Xbox Live arcade game, but yet they turned it down.
6392423	6397086	And when you look at some of the stuff that's on Xbox Live Marketplace that they let through... Well, you know what?
6397106	6400568	It's interesting you say that, because I'm not the only one who's been turned down.
6400829	6403911	Have you heard of the Japanese shoot-'em-up developer, Cave?
6404891	6405752	I think I have, yes.
6407546	6416589	I was absolutely floored when I found out that they submitted two of their games to Live Arcade and they were turned down because I absolutely adore their games.
6417150	6421391	I have a Japanese PS2 that I basically play shoot-em-ups on.
6423292	6428394	I'm planning on getting a Japanese 360 so I can play the upcoming Cave Shooters if they're not localized here.
6430334	6431555	I was absolutely floored.
6431955	6433635	But on the other hand, I felt, well, you know what?
6433675	6436036	If they're being rejected, then maybe I don't feel so bad.
6436596	6437757	At least you're in good company.
6437837	6446840	All right, well, talking about the development cycle of the game, you know, a lot of folks kind of, you know, are critical of the Xbox 360 control scheme.
6447120	6453442	But you kind of found an interesting way around it for a game that requires kind of precision in turning like Snake does, right?
6453882	6458384	Yeah, well, everybody knows that the 360's D-pad leaves a lot to be desired.
6459376	6468059	One of the first things I did when I started playing XBLA games was I went and I bought an arcade stick because even for Pac-Man, you know, it just gums up the works.
6468319	6469960	I can't play Pac-Man with that D-pad.
6470680	6485605	So at first, you know, I was thinking, well, you know, we can use the analog sticks and you've got those options, but really the best solution, and I say so in the trailer, not in the trailer, I say so in the other video I put up, I say so in the documentation, and I say so within the game itself.
6486178	6488979	The best solution is to use the A, B, X, and Y face buttons.
6489199	6492561	A is down, Y is up, and then you've got X and B for the sides.
6492701	6495222	And that is absolutely the best way to control this game.
6496383	6496863	All right.
6497303	6498904	That sounds like a very creative workaround.
6498964	6500605	So that's probably what I'll use.
6500625	6502265	No, we weren't using those buttons for anything else.
6503246	6506507	Basically, I was thinking, well, you know, we could do turbo boosts, we could do this and that.
6507088	6511990	But in the end, I decided for this version, because I might expand it later, especially considering that
6512492	6516733	The version I'm releasing is not the version I originally anticipated.
6516753	6518854	I didn't quite get everything that I wanted in there.
6519674	6523435	But for this version, I decided, let's keep the accessibility high.
6524836	6530277	Let's keep the gameplay simple so that you look at it, you know exactly how it works, you can jump right in.
6531278	6538520	The challenge of this game is not in new gameplay elements, but it's in the challenging level designs and all the other things you can do with it.
6539042	6540503	Well, it works extremely similarly to the way that, uh,
6568886	6573987	any internet ranking board work before we had online leaderboards that were integrated into the game itself.
6574667	6584190	Anybody who played Ikaruga on GameCube and participated in the rankings there, there are also rankings in a lot of arcade games where they basically just put codes on the screen.
6584970	6589711	And you go to their website, you put in the code, yeah, you put in the code and boom, there you are on the internet rankings.
6589991	6594192	And we'll have it keep track of your email address so that if you submit the same score twice,
6595039	6601485	or if you submit two scores for one course, it'll automatically overwrite your lower score with your higher one.
6602006	6611354	And the reason there are over 50 leaderboards is because there's going to be a leaderboard for every course, every difficulty, every round you can play in survival mode.
6611734	6614357	You can go crazy competing for high scores in this game.
6615598	6617840	We're still finishing up the internet ranking.
6617880	6620102	It should hopefully be ready by the end of next week.
6620549	6620809	All right.
6621149	6624411	Now, you mentioned there's all these different types of internet ranking boards.
6624431	6628613	That's because you have all these different types of modes and handicaps in the game.
6628653	6635676	And it sounds like you've made this very accessible for children as well as, you know, hardcore people that really get into these types of arcade games.
6635996	6638558	Tell us about some of your favorite modes that you have in the game.
6638578	6643680	Well, I mean, the main game mode basically throws you into a course consisting of eight levels.
6644335	6664178	and actually it may or may not consist of eight levels depending on whether you lose any lives along the way and I'll leave it at that but if you can complete all the levels on the course you'll get a code for internet ranking and the courses are played on several different difficulty levels what you'll get is you know basically this kind of the same concept
6664673	6667795	Like, for example, on easy, maybe you'll get something that kind of looks like a tree.
6668135	6669416	On normal, you'll get a tree.
6669716	6672698	On difficult, you'll get a tree with more branches, that kind of thing.
6672738	6678262	So they'll take the same concept, and we'll just keep making it more and more difficult as you go up in level.
6679183	6685627	And, you know, a lot of the level themes are very interesting, and part of the fun of the game is to see, oh, well, now I'm playing on a new level.
6685667	6687088	I wonder what this level's going to look like.
6687908	6691010	And the survival mode, well, that's just, you know, classic.
6691631	6693472	A lot of the old Snake games just played like that.
6694212	6723838	you get one life and you just last as long as you can and you grow to ridiculous lengths and this version throws in a time limit that you can't just go in a circle and survive forever and you get a time bonus when you pick up a target but you're just going to have to be really careful not to block yourself off from more targets or trap yourself it's very interesting and one of the fake achievements I'm going to call them goals in the game is to last in there for four minutes and it's harder than it sounds
6725035	6726196	What about some of the things you've put?
6726236	6732701	Now, this is something for a player who's really, really good at the game, but what about somebody who's not so great at Snake 360?
6734102	6736424	There's kind of modes you've put in for them, too, right?
6737444	6738405	Yeah, well, you know what?
6738665	6743749	My mother's even played this game using a couple of handicaps that I've put in.
6743949	6745210	There's slower speeds.
6745410	6750694	You can turn the Snake speed down to slow or even slowest, which is half the normal speed.
6751586	6753428	It plays pretty slowly.
6753468	6768041	If you've got good reflexes, you'll want to stick with the normal or the faster speeds, but there's a slow speed for them, and there's also visual guides that you can turn on in the form of lines that extend from the targets in all four directions, so you can line up more easily with those.
6769042	6777189	And if you play with those on, then you won't be eligible for the Internet ranking, but it's something that'll get a lot more people into the game, making it easier to
6777574	6778254	That sort of thing.
6778414	6781295	And there's also something exciting I threw in called Kid Mode.
6781975	6783716	And with this, you know, anybody can play.
6783796	6785496	It's like bumper bowling for Snake.
6786096	6787977	Basically, you know, you're rushing into a wall.
6788197	6788497	Boom.
6789137	6789877	Nothing happens.
6790558	6792518	You know, you're stuck on the wall.
6792698	6795619	Oh, well, now you have three seconds to turn and go somewhere else.
6796537	6804627	and basically the effect of this is you won't die unless you trap yourself somehow, spiral, you know, that sort of deal.
6805148	6808892	So you could just, you know, go there all day and then the easy difficulty has no time limit.
6809313	6814880	So you could spend three hours, you know, on one level and take as much time as you need so long as you don't trap yourself.
6816497	6822742	Alright, sounds like there's something for the young and the old alike in this game, so awesome.
6822762	6830209	Yeah, and if you're not sure whether you're young or old, if you start playing and then the game sees you're having trouble, it'll offer to turn one of these handicaps on for you.
6830683	6831003	Huh.
6831464	6831844	Interesting.
6831884	6832204	All right.
6832284	6832724	Very cool.
6833485	6836727	Let's talk about kind of the bigger picture for a minute, just community games in general.
6837608	6842190	Kind of not just your game, but all the other games kind of going in when the new Xbox Experience launches.
6842231	6847694	You know, we've heard kind of leading up to this launch, we've heard a lot about Netflix, we've heard a lot about avatars.
6848094	6848835	It seems to me...
6849275	6854799	for as big of a deal as at least I perceive this community games thing to be where we have a lot of great indie developers showing up.
6855299	6861083	We're not hearing as much about it as you would think, you know, with all these, what, 20 games on the service right now.
6861604	6865827	Are you kind of surprised that there's been a little less focus on community games leading up towards the launch?
6866807	6878916	You know, on one hand I am, but on the other hand I'm really not because, you know, let's say I'm EA or Activision or some other big name publisher and I've got $60 games on the shelf from launching a new IP like Mirror's Edge and, um,
6879454	6886095	You know, all of a sudden, Microsoft is promoting the heck out of all these little five and ten and two and a half dollar games.
6886736	6889076	And I'm going to be a little bit, you know, pissed off.
6889096	6898438	I'm going to be like, hey, hi, we want to keep selling our $60 games, so you guys better lay off and delay this to next year or we're going to stop publishing on your console.
6899818	6902119	That would be my point of view if I was a big name publisher.
6902819	6906580	So I'd be, if I were them, I'd be happy that they're not plugging the heck out of this stuff.
6908120	6908520	Excuse me.
6909139	6911561	Obviously, these relationships are very important to Microsoft.
6911621	6916305	So, yeah, I'm kind of not surprised that we're a little under the radar.
6917006	6922631	But I think once people get a hold of the new NXE, they're definitely going to notice community games.
6922671	6925633	It's right there with Live Arcade and the Game Store.
6925653	6928136	If you go to the Game Marketplace, it's right there as a category.
6929737	6936343	And if you've been accepted into the NXE preview and you already have it, you can see plain as day there are already 20 games on the service.
6936423	6936583	So,
6937853	6939494	The visibility is not going to be an issue.
6940415	6943658	I think it's going to kind of sneak up on people and really surprise them.
6944338	6945539	Alright, very cool.
6946200	6954947	You know, one thing, before we let you go, Aaron, one thing we always like to ask our guests here on Orange Lounge Radio, it's a segment we always do every week, we want to ask you, how was your gaming week?
6954987	6957629	What other kinds of video games have you been playing besides Snake360?
6959448	6961809	Well, you know what, this last week has been kind of crazy.
6962230	6975818	I took the whole week off from work, you know, presumably to focus on Snake, but then I basically came down with a really bad cold, and my fiancée had a really bad cold as well, you know, starting last week and going into this week.
6976418	6986404	So I was very distracted all week, partially with, you know, with Snake, partially with having a cold, and then, of course, for a lot of times I couldn't stay focused, so...
6987148	6992730	I diverted my attention with a little bit of Half-Life 2, which I hadn't really gotten to play very much of yet.
6992810	6994350	I'm enjoying it a lot.
6995271	6997472	I completed a few more of the advanced portal maps.
6997532	7000052	I still have one left that I'm completely stuck on.
7001173	7008395	I picked up the new Namco compilation, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade, which is a complete cash-in because it's so shoddily thrown together.
7009015	7016558	But it features every XBLA release Namco has had up to this point, and it was only $30, so I'm a sucker for those.
7017336	7018877	and so I played that a little bit.
7020619	7026703	I haven't been able to get out to an arcade but I usually try to play a step game at least once a week.
7027044	7028545	It's the only kind of exercise I can do.
7030086	7031627	Well Aaron, rest up and feel better.
7031647	7039373	I know we've been hearing you coughing a little bit tonight but I hope by the time this game launches you're well enough to celebrate when NXT comes out on November 19th.
7039833	7046018	I'm really excited you were able to have me on here talking about it and I hope for all the arcade game fans, retro game fans or
7046550	7049131	Just, you know, fans of fun games.
7049431	7053652	I hope you guys could take a few minutes of your day to check out Snake360.
7053672	7062815	The trial game will run for four minutes, and you'll be able to try out one of the courses on three different levels and battle mode with two players.
7063755	7068157	And just give it a shot, and I appreciate, you know, giving it a try.
7069011	7074376	All right, well, the game is Snake 360, and it's launching with the new Xbox 360 experience on November 19th.
7074857	7080002	It has got a free time trial for you to check out the game, and if you want the full game, it's only going to set you back 400 points.
7080302	7084726	If you want more information in the meantime, check out the website at snake360.com.
7085147	7087889	Aaron, thanks so much for joining us tonight, and best of luck with the game.
7087929	7089351	I hope it does really well for you.
7091072	7094795	I'd love to quit my IT job, but thank you very much, Rob, for having me on the program.
7109227	7113009	I hope you guys will check out the demo.
7113349	7115110	At least look at the YouTube on the website.
7115230	7116491	It looks pretty rad.
7117471	7119452	Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news.
7119592	7120433	Loki.
7120533	7128396	Speaking of retro games, you may remember the Atari 2600 flashback systems that were released a while back.
7129157	7130578	They even had one that was in the
7131678	7133779	True2Life, Woodgrain.
7133859	7141263	But now, the same company that brought those out are actually now bringing out USB Atari 2600 controllers.
7141983	7157671	You can actually use those to play whatever the heck you'd like, but mostly they're ideal for main usage, and they are compatible, of course, with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and will run you $14.99.
7160984	7164305	Boy, they just love to whore out the old school Atari 2600 stuff, don't they?
7164545	7164805	Oh, yeah.
7165065	7165365	Oh, yeah.
7165845	7172847	Well, going from old school controller that's $14.99 to something rather new school, who doesn't love to play pinball?
7173107	7173747	Right, DarkSakura?
7173767	7174348	You love pinball.
7174908	7176328	Pinball is fantastic.
7176408	7180849	You spend a lot of money on pinball, but you buy the authentic pinball machines.
7180909	7185031	I don't know how big of a fan you are of video pinball games, you know, the types of things.
7185051	7185331	Some.
7185591	7185851	Okay.
7186491	7187671	Would you be willing to spend $300 on your obsession?
7190700	7191181	Depends.
7191421	7192382	Is it like an ultracade?
7192483	7193083	Well, here it is.
7193384	7196909	Nanotech Entertainment is putting out what's called a Pinball Wizard Controller.
7197409	7205000	Real flipper buttons, an actual plunger, motion sensing thing for the tilting on it, $300 for the controller.
7206602	7207263	Very interesting.
7207283	7207643	I'd do it.
7208864	7215228	You'd have to be pretty sick into this in order to justify this, but Nanotech is putting this out.
7215328	7217609	It is the Pinball Wizard Controller.
7218370	7223593	It's got what's called a Mosh Ion or whatever, Mode Ion, Motion, IO Adapter.
7224354	7226115	No special drivers required for this.
7226235	7228277	It's apparently fully configurable.
7228697	7235922	It will work with a lot of existing pinball games that are out there right now, something they call a fancy-smancy future pinball engine.
7236862	7237122	Wow.
7237763	7242785	Apparently it ships with a combination of a variety of different 3D pinball games already out there.
7243165	7247748	Some recreations of famous pinball tables from Gottlieb.
7248448	7249689	I don't know what tables those are yet, though.
7249709	7250389	That hasn't been said.
7250469	7252950	But you can keep an eye out for more information on this.
7253391	7254691	Nanotech Entertainment.
7255232	7256832	It's nanotechent.com.
7257053	7258553	All I got to say is the who will sue.
7259774	7260194	Why is that?
7260734	7261355	Pinball Wizard.
7262355	7263496	I know, because of the name, right?
7263636	7263796	Yeah.
7264649	7269493	I think that by now, you know, it should be fair use.
7270413	7270874	We'll see.
7271374	7271654	I don't know.
7271694	7272815	It's a little much for me.
7273115	7275777	I'd rather just take the plunge and get a real machine.
7276197	7278739	I need one already, but they're so expensive.
7279540	7280320	I don't have the money.
7281601	7283342	And yeah, I got that collection on the Wii.
7283382	7284483	That's pretty awesome.
7284703	7285784	I guess I can just keep that for now.
7287376	7301867	Well, there is something that actually is a little interesting, I should say, as far as some stuff for Rock Revolution, if anyone is actually interested in it.
7302848	7303969	Who's interested in that game?
7306078	7306659	Rock Revolution.
7307480	7310083	You know, as I said, I'm still curious to check it out.
7310123	7312605	I'm just waiting for the price to drop, which should happen soon.
7312926	7314928	But I also love the movie Showgirls.
7315609	7317351	So take my opinion with a grain of salt.
7317932	7321695	Well, at any rate, there's some downloadable content for Xbox Live Marketplace.
7322436	7324638	There is Desro, Death Reel.
7324838	7325559	That's a cool song.
7326860	7329622	Naoki, remixed by Kuro, which is my only shining star.
7332345	7333566	Sorry, got tongue-tied.
7333806	7336368	Mutsuhiko Izumi with Model DD8.
7337249	7340092	Daisuke Kurosawa with Progressive Baby and Chimera.
7341033	7341173	So...
7342386	7355913	Okay, so despite all the crap we've given Rock Revolution in saying why don't they just bring out Guitar Freaks over here, interesting yet non-surprising that some of these tracks are crossover, at least the artists are certainly from those series, coming over to Rock Revolution.
7356973	7357313	Interesting.
7358314	7367799	There actually is a press release also out by Konami stating that it actually is shipping, will be $129.99 and is available for Xbox 360 and PS3.
7372894	7374944	Alright, well, check it out if you really want.
7378170	7382911	Now what's kind of interesting is we talk about game piracy a lot.
7383271	7387932	Well there was one game actually that was out there, World of Goo, that was actually pretty good.
7387992	7392633	It was more of a puzzle game that came out on PC and WiiWare.
7394374	7403536	What's interesting though is the developer actually has come out, designer Ron Carmel, who mentioned that his game has received a 90% piracy rate.
7407188	7434104	and um yeah apparently he's been doing some research in the different torrent sites with you know some torrents with 500 seeders and 300 leechers and received emails from people who initially stole the game but ended up buying the full product and um it's kind of interesting to see that like you know smaller developers like this are really affected by piracy you know quite a bit um
7435114	7435615	It's kind of neat though.
7435635	7438500	Remember they had a t-shirt for this at one time.
7438520	7441665	Remember they were doing that Target thing with independent games tied in?
7442126	7442927	Oh yeah, yeah.
7442947	7443909	Too bad that never happened.
7444510	7446353	It happened for like a week.
7446554	7447335	Yes, exactly.
7448076	7448878	That was kind of sad.
7450205	7450745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7481139	7484862	Um, I get to go see it for free the night before it comes out.
7485002	7485322	Do you?
7485382	7486803	Are you going to review it for us here on the show?
7487984	7488524	I guess.
7488664	7501893	I'm trying to get out of it because I, as it is, I was managed to get a couple extra tickets for, um, Irene and, um, Nelly's mom, but my sister might want to go see it.
7501953	7505056	So I'm going to try to see if she can go my place, but I don't think that's going to happen.
7505076	7505116	So.
7506593	7507713	I probably will have to see it.
7508073	7510814	Kuroishi in chat says, oh yeah, and those Candy Mountain shirts.
7510974	7511794	I own one of those.
7511834	7512454	Thank you very much.
7512514	7514615	I bought the Candy Mountain shirt at Hot Topic.
7515615	7517035	Candy Mountain, Charlie.
7517315	7518576	Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
7518616	7521256	DarkSakura, are you going to be buying tickets to see Twilight?
7521596	7524057	I'm dying to know what you feel about Twilight.
7524557	7526057	If somebody buys them for me.
7527518	7530298	I was just curious if you were a fan or not a fan.
7531179	7532419	I want to read the books first.
7533191	7533731	Understandable.
7534672	7540516	By the way, there's a new trailer apparently for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that's showing before Twilight that looks pretty hot.
7540756	7541617	I wouldn't be surprised.
7541637	7542577	If you're a Harry Potter fan.
7542978	7544298	Well, maybe that'll be worth going to see it.
7544699	7545539	Harry Potter!
7547180	7552744	And a new trailer for Star Trek is apparently in front of the new James Bond movie, which I need to go see.
7553164	7553965	I love James Bond.
7554645	7554886	Anyhow.
7556087	7557108	Have you seen the new trailer?
7557128	7560670	Speaking of trailers, and since we're totally off topic right now, the new trailer for Watchmen?
7561891	7563032	No, I haven't seen the new trailer.
7563072	7565293	Just the last one with the Smashing Pumpkins song.
7565333	7571437	See, because I'm actually reading the actual graphic novel there.
7571497	7575299	So a lot of the stuff that I've seen in the graphic novel, obviously I can see in the trailer.
7575319	7575780	It's kind of cool.
7576720	7582904	What's interesting, though, is it uses one of the songs that's in the trailer is a song that's on one of the radio stations in Grand Theft Auto 4.
7584204	7589148	It's actually the trailer, the song that they used when they first teased Grand Theft Auto 4.
7589188	7590409	They had their teaser trailer.
7590789	7591610	It was that same song.
7592270	7592490	Hmm.
7593691	7594071	Interesting.
7594131	7596553	Lots of good movies on the lineup for next year.
7596573	7598094	A lot of anticipated movies.
7598114	7600276	Of course, we had a few of them this year between The Dark Knight and everything else.
7600296	7602618	Which, by the way, doesn't Dark Knight come out on Blu-ray pretty soon?
7603399	7604481	And just in time for your SingStar ABBA
7620663	7621684	here at the home of Roberts.
7622284	7624165	Anyhow, Left 4 Dead.
7624225	7629247	Here's another game I've got to check out, and I've just got no freaking time left between all the Wrath of the Lich King I've been playing.
7629948	7635891	Left 4 Dead apparently brings some clues to other Valve games, Team Fortress 2.
7636691	7643314	Apparently, according to Kotaku, one of their readers actually was looking through the Left 4 Dead demo and found something very interesting.
7643575	7645716	There's a little cereal called Choco Bites.
7646536	7646917	Team Fortress 2
7657955	7669484	Apparently, though, there's only nine Team Fortress 2 classes out there right now, so a tenth one is coming soon, apparently, if this little Easter egg is to be believed.
7670304	7671985	Very good catch, though.
7672025	7674788	I gotta say, that's pretty impressive somebody caught that.
7675108	7676189	But, uh, Valve?
7677222	7681168	Valve has some pretty rabid fans, and I understand why.
7681228	7684873	They are definitely masters of the first-person genre, I would say.
7685253	7689239	Between Half-Life and Portal and now Left 4 Dead is generating tons of buzz.
7689579	7690701	People love their Valve, don't they?
7691274	7693096	They sure do, but guess what else people like?
7693196	7693576	What's that?
7693856	7695958	Rare.
7696038	7706467	There's actually an Easter egg in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts that says they're all in the pipeline, you know.
7706607	7710990	New Killer Instinct, Battletoads, and Force Gemini games, even Ghoulies 2.
7712572	7713733	Oh, you'll never believe that.
7713913	7715474	I ruined my own humorous tape.
7717696	7718016	Hmm.
7718377	7718577	So...
7720475	7720635	Xenogias
7748035	7750637	as in Z-E-N-O-G-I-A-S.
7751277	7751538	Yeah.
7752038	7752778	That'd be funny.
7753119	7755821	That'd be funny if the people translating it weren't told about Xenogears.
7756121	7758943	Kind of going back to the whole Left 4 Dead thing.
7759323	7769350	They should make some other games in the whole Half-Life Valve universe including I think that they should make one based off the parody Half-Life Full Life Consequences.
7771412	7772713	If you've ever seen that video it's hilarious.
7772773	7773253	No I have not.
7773873	7774334	Sorry to say.
7774594	7775675	It's hilarious retarded.
7777957	7781819	Good comment from chat, kind of going back a story, talking about the whole Team Fortress 2 thing.
7782060	7785082	Seg has an interesting thought on what that could be all about.
7785502	7789065	He says, I think that the 10th is actually the announcer for an action figure.
7789385	7793068	The announcer is the 10th character, and the announcer could be an action figure.
7793148	7796530	So no new class, just the acknowledgement that the announcer is the 10th character.
7797671	7798272	Interesting theory.
7798912	7799673	An action figure?
7801284	7802345	were you listening to the story?
7802425	7811694	the back of the box teases collect all 10 action figures there you go I thought they were actually making action figures no but that would be kind of rad too don't you think?
7812915	7813475	Alright, anyhow.
7814175	7820317	That's it for the stories tonight until we get to some last minute stories, but now's the part of the show where we like to open up the Skype line.
7820337	7823617	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7823717	7831419	Our 800 number is toll free in the US and Canada, but if you're in Europe or somewhere far away, you might want to consider using Skype because it's going to cost you money otherwise.
7832039	7835400	Meanwhile, while we wait for a call to come in, oh, never mind, we got calls coming in right now.
7835700	7837801	We'll just, we'll hold off on last minute stories for just a little bit.
7838101	7839201	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7839221	7839521	Who's this?
7841325	7843927	This is Ake Ripper in Sweden.
7845128	7846289	How are you doing Ake Ripper?
7846309	7847130	What's on your mind tonight?
7852755	7857198	Just ranting about Left 4 Dead.
7857559	7860121	That's just completely awesome.
7861113	7866454	Tell us something about Left 4 Dead, because I don't think any of us in studio have actually gotten a chance to really play it yet.
7866534	7874715	I know it's kind of on the list of things we want to do, but I know for me, I still have the Mirror's Edge demo to play too, but there's been another game taking up a lot of my time.
7875636	7876096	If you haven't heard.
7877076	7880797	Well, plus you are, as we all know, a WoW addict.
7881697	7882237	Yes, we know.
7882257	7885717	And I'm like a... What can I say?
7885777	7885817	Um...
7891045	7893626	Old WoW addict, sort of.
7894646	7895087	Recovering.
7895107	7896307	Well, tell us about Left 4 Dead.
7896967	7898728	What makes this game so flippin' awesome?
7900108	7908892	Well, it is... Well, you have... You are playing like four... You have a maximum of four people.
7910352	7919796	And you are to survive... Survive... Like this stomping zombie assault...
7920836	7923237	That's just blow you away, really.
7924537	7928278	It's so utterly good.
7930158	7938980	Now, correct me if I'm wrong, even if you're playing this game by yourself, you actually have like three other people with you that are all run by artificial intelligence, right?
7939560	7940381	How does that work?
7940561	7941221	Is it good?
7941461	7943381	I would imagine that they would be stupid.
7945982	7949883	I haven't got much experience playing with bots, really, since
7950697	7962204	Well, it's all about the multiplayer multiplayer experience and playing to online play.
7963265	7968548	That's the only thing that's interesting in my way, in my view.
7968809	7972171	Toshin in our chatroom seems to think the bot AI is probably better than humans.
7972711	7975253	Actdeft agrees, though, that Left 4 Dead is really all about the multiplayer.
7977234	7977634	Yeah, but...
7979476	7981676	I would disagree.
7981776	7990298	The bots are, from my point of view, quite stupid.
7993038	8003060	But then again, I'm not in one way super at shooters in a way.
8004140	8007761	It's sort of weird in one way, since my take on most shooters
8009099	8015363	on single-play shooters, that is, is that give me god mode, and that's it, really.
8017184	8021046	But multiplayer shooters, you can't do that.
8024061	8027143	Good for me in one way, so I get to learn to play in one way.
8027503	8028764	So you can't cheat in this game.
8028804	8033987	Well, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this game, and Elise can check out the demo right now.
8034688	8035188	It's out there.
8035288	8039070	Yeah, I have actually been playing the demo for a week now.
8039651	8040031	Wow.
8041091	8046595	The demo was released actually last Friday to us that pre-
8053038	8053378	bought it.
8054018	8054258	Mm-hmm.
8054539	8055059	Oh, pre-ordered?
8056099	8056679	Yeah.
8056819	8062321	I remember that this game, if I remember right, this had some of the longest lines it packs, too, the previews of this game.
8062361	8064362	So a lot of people are definitely anticipating this one.
8064382	8064942	And it's Valve.
8065002	8065842	People love their Valve.
8066423	8066923	There you have it.
8067063	8071144	Yeah, but if you think of it, it has a, well, what is it?
8071284	8077747	It was originally shown at E3 in 2007, actually.
8079587	8081868	And then at some point it got
8082805	8083806	Thank you for watching!
8108510	8120879	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and we'll take a couple more calls tonight and then we've got to get to some last minute stories and get on out of here for the night if you can believe it.
8121640	8123181	Alright, let's go ahead and go to the phones.
8123741	8125082	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8125102	8125442	Who's this?
8126533	8127694	Hello, this is Seg.
8127834	8129355	Hey, Seg, what's on your mind, buddy?
8130416	8142145	Well, earlier this week, Gamasutra put up an article about IP property in academia, specifically with game schools.
8143426	8151533	And the thing that really got me were the comments that the president of Digipend
8153771	8161356	really caught me off guard, especially coming from a president of an educational institution.
8162237	8174727	Specifically, apparently the policy at DigiPen is that any intellectual property presented in the classroom is solely owned by DigiPen.
8177008	8178850	At least that's the policy as I understand it.
8180391	8204624	and as a graduate of a game design program but at a different institution, Emerson College, I found that really offensive to the student because it says that, I know I'm skipping over some of the details on it, but
8205771	8212696	Apparently, the reason that they chose to own, you know, just to decide that, oh, the school owns all the property and has all the control.
8212837	8217700	Wait, wait, so just to clarify, you're saying if a student creates something for a class project, the school owns it?
8218421	8219342	At DigiPen, yes.
8219542	8219722	Huh.
8221583	8223545	And the reason that he cites...
8225331	8233176	is that, oh, the IP laws are so complicated, and it just makes things easier, and all this.
8233296	8241241	And I felt that that's missing a very large, significant teaching moment, an opportunity.
8243584	8246866	to the students by just pushing off to the side.
8247747	8264660	Now, at least with Emerson College, which is my personal experience, the policy is basically a quasi-shared where Emerson... I made a thesis video game called Antidote for my BFA thesis.
8265462	8266843	and I own it.
8267443	8280510	It's mine with, I mean I can put an asterisk on the software that I used and all that but as far as Emerson College's role, I use their equipment and they have a distribution license pretty much.
8280610	8286092	They can showcase it as here's what one of our students did but they don't own it.
8286512	8291575	They don't own everything which allowed me the capability to do whatever I want with it.
8292216	8299042	whereas students of DigiPen apparently don't have that ownership in their own thing.
8299282	8302284	I mean, for example, you may know a game called Portal.
8303065	8303745	Yeah, I've heard of it.
8304426	8305167	You may have heard of it.
8305827	8312553	It was actually a few students from DigiPen who created a game called Nebacular Drop, which... I remember that.
8315715	8318057	So... Oh.
8319018	8319438	Okay, weird.
8319558	8319918	No, go ahead.
8319938	8320759	Sorry, there was a feedback loop.
8321520	8321620	Um...
8323471	8327755	They made Nebacular Drop, and that was the game that got them the job at Valve.
8328916	8339326	But it was sort of just like this gentleman's agreement that DigiPen wouldn't care that it's slightly similar because they got the jobs at DigiPen.
8340307	8347994	But there's no guarantee that any student at DigiPen would get that affordedness.
8349584	8356009	Is it possible that DigiPen does this, I mean, just theorizing here, maybe in a way to protect the students so that students aren't ripping off from each other?
8357530	8363073	Like if you see something really cool that another student presents and you're like, wow, maybe I want to kind of make that game someday.
8364374	8365235	Could it be a protection thing?
8365855	8367516	That's sort of afforded already.
8367616	8370759	I mean, somebody else outside of the classroom can also do that.
8372478	8372899	regardless.
8373879	8394529	Here's my sort of test and for anyone, not just for video games but for anyone wanting to do a higher education in creative arts and even not just creative arts is just ask the question can I put my work in a creative commons license?
8394609	8399911	Can I choose specifically choose to do a creative license or not?
8400680	8429595	because then you have the choice of where you want to put your work and incorporating whether it be commercial or free or Creative Commons work into your work because the sort of weird thing that hasn't been addressed is because DigiPen owns this work you can't do copy left apparently I mean that's a murky area and I'm not Mr. Lawyer here but
8431975	8440360	It kind of means that you can't do the Coffee Left attributions that you're supposed to do if you use a Creative Commons license thing.
8442060	8451526	Because it's a restrictive copyright onto one particular entity that doesn't allow you to do Copy Left.
8452298	8459341	You know, I didn't see the story on Gamma Studio, but now I'm very curious about it, especially if there's any kind of follow-up to it, because you would think at some point this is going to be challenged.
8459721	8464564	You know, what if the students create something they want to make?
8464984	8469866	The comments on there have been rather debated extensively.
8470246	8475248	And there are other schools... I mean, the thing that gets me is that this isn't unique to the video game industry.
8476689	8480130	People like to make that oppression, but it's not.
8480351	8480451	It's...
8481661	8483683	General creative endeavors.
8483863	8488727	Well, you know, I studied television and radio when I was in college.
8489528	8492691	And one of the classes I was in, we had to write a script for a TV show, basically.
8493031	8494092	But we essentially owned it.
8494372	8494852	You know what I mean?
8496033	8498736	It wasn't something that we would write a script and the college would own it.
8498956	8503440	But at the same time, we were encouraged, if we wanted to, to write a script based on a show that was already out there.
8504614	8518337	Exactly, yeah, and let's say you wrote that, I mean, if you wrote that script that was heavily lifted off of something, it would be all null and void, but then you got the plagiarism, which is already policies in any college, and that counts as a plagiarism and all that.
8518577	8530300	But for some reason, you know, at our school, it kind of didn't matter, because, you know, we weren't, obviously, you weren't going to say, it was just for a school project, you know, whatever, but, you know, there were some people that were writing scripts that they planned to use someday in the real world.
8530320	8530920	Exactly.
8530940	8531480	That was interesting.
8532717	8561211	and I just find it very troubling that this certain academic institution wants to not only not teach IP policy I mean those were classes that I was required I basically went to a film school and created my own little curriculum for interactive media within the new media program but
8561994	8573239	There are a lot of kids who made their foundation and were able to travel off from that independently of the college because they had the capability of doing so.
8574179	8580962	And it strikes me that DigiPen doesn't do that or want people to do that.
8581022	8591347	It just seems that they're more centered on making people that will fit into a role in a larger company and denying the choice of having students
8593479	8612425	not only form a grander knowledge of the industry and being an actual participant and professional that is aware of the industry, but just making people that fit into smaller slots.
8613665	8618407	And I think that's a missed opportunity.
8619653	8621653	for students, to box them in that way.
8621854	8630115	I've got to read, I can't talk about this for too much longer, but I've got to read some comments from chat, because Charam has some very interesting things to say.
8631135	8646078	YYR, who happens to be Aaron, who we talked to earlier in the show about Snake360, says, just to clarify, Microsoft doesn't touch your IP if you publish a game on X and A. But the flip side of the coin, they're not responsible if you get sued over IP infringement and so on.
8646558	8647058	Exactly.
8647839	8651522	Bobby from the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf, says something else interesting here.
8651582	8652763	He's done some stuff with game design.
8652803	8657748	I know he's played around with X and A. You know, I really thought this was standard with game design colleges.
8657848	8661331	This is the first time I've heard of a game design curriculum that didn't own your homework.
8661891	8669138	Hell, the last company I worked for owned anything I created as a program even on my off hours because I was dumb and didn't contest that portion of the employment contract.
8669759	8670359	That's different.
8670579	8671861	First of all, that's very different.
8672742	8675726	in an employment context that is extremely different.
8676427	8682877	And the reason is that in an employment context, you are being paid
8683908	8685008	to do this work.
8685728	8702112	And that is completely different from being in an educational facility where you are paying or funding on your own, you know, scholarships or whatever, to get an education to formulate a base for you to get to an employment situation or make your own company.
8702532	8705553	So it's vastly different than employment.
8707053	8712434	You know, I mean, in the employment context, yes, you were doing work for hire.
8713644	8719586	But in the educational aspect, you're not doing this work for hire.
8720506	8722087	Blackwell just wants to clarify real quick.
8722407	8728209	The company that he did, it was actually a defense contractor company, but they would still own the games he created on the weekend.
8729298	8757545	but I guess the difference here is in a school you pay them, in a company they pay you so that's why you kind of have the different now like in California there's laws that prevent a company from having that overreach where as long as you do not use company equipment, you are not on company time and you don't use company specific knowledge the company you're employed to cannot
8759710	8763311	take claim of anything you do as long as there's that separation.
8763711	8766431	Of course, not every state's California.
8767211	8771492	But that's also in the legal framework of you're being paid to do creative work.
8772532	8776233	But in an educational environment, you're not being paid to do work.
8776993	8780034	You're paying them, if anything, for a rental fee.
8781514	8788495	I hate to reduce it so simply, but you're paying the institution...
8790185	8803529	for that, and there's no precedence for that besides certain very few colleges making that ownership policy, which a lot of colleges don't really go that far.
8803929	8814052	They may have some influence, some collusion there, but to have complete and utter ownership like that is not very common.
8816834	8825824	I gotta wrap up, but thank you for bringing up a topic, especially on a night when we've been talking about moderation and kind of talking about these usage rights.
8826164	8829848	I think sometimes these are things that a lot of people don't think about that goes on behind the scenes.
8830229	8831730	Can I just close with one thought?
8832751	8833012	Of course.
8833352	8835695	Regardless, for anyone out there who is
8836255	8836835	and others.
8836875	8837155	Be aware.
8860123	8866231	Be aware, this is something you should ask the admission counselor regardless of whatever field, even if it's creative or not.
8867214	8871617	This is something you should be aware about before you make your decision for your higher education.
8872117	8875720	Very good advice, especially considering we have a lot of people around that age that listen to this program.
8875920	8877241	Seg, thanks so much for the insight.
8877361	8878061	Always appreciate it.
8878281	8879102	Thanks for having me.
8879122	8880242	It's always great to be on the show.
8880302	8881283	Alright, you are most welcome.
8881323	8881643	Take care.
8881723	8885906	And hey, I hear there's another episode of Homestar Runner coming out very soon?
8886446	8886987	Now, now.
8887267	8892010	First of all, I'm only representing myself and being only myself.
8893343	8894064	Alright, fair enough.
8894264	8895725	But there's also that coming around the bed.
8896205	8896546	Alright.
8897186	8897647	Sounds good.
8898327	8898627	Alright.
8898707	8899408	Take care, everybody.
8899488	8899908	You too, buddy.
8900489	8900669	Yep.
8900889	8901209	Bye-bye.
8902630	8905293	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8905333	8908375	Probably going to do one more quick, quick call, and then we're going to call it a night.
8908415	8909376	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8909396	8909696	Who's this?
8910817	8911578	Oh, wow.
8911678	8912859	It's me, Legend of Zaku.
8912879	8913499	What's up, guys?
8914260	8914500	Not much.
8914540	8914880	What's up?
8916141	8919664	Nah, just hanging in there, just trying to, like, you know,
8920336	8928269	Since I'm currently unemployed right now, because that job market is busting my balls right now, I'm just holding myself back from gaming in general.
8928950	8930653	Except for the stuff that I managed to get for free.
8931786	8950481	But yeah, let me see, I just found out over the weekend that Capcom, in their most infinite wisdom, quote-unquote, you know, I'm being sarcastic here, has decided to hold back, you know, the arcade releases, Street Fighter IV, effectively, you know, just saying, fuck you, we're not gonna do it, go fuck off, the arcade industry's dead.
8951541	8953663	Which is pretty, I mean, I don't blame them, though.
8954144	8960809	I guess I don't blame them because, you know, fighting games, especially in the arcade level, are kind of, have been relegated to a niche recently.
8961789	8970193	It's not like DDR where it has that casual appeal where people can just easily jump into it without any risk.
8973175	8976076	Whereas you've got fighting games that are much more difficult.
8976096	8979618	They have a much higher learning curve in terms of moves and all that.
8981280	8988843	Zaku, I hate to kind of throw you a curveball here, but you made a very interesting comment on the last call, the kind of ties in, because you're talking about job market, economy, blah, blah, blah.
8989403	8999907	You were mentioning on kind of to say phone call here, when I worked full time as a mobile software engineer, I had to sign a typical confidentiality agreement basically stating that anything I wrote or ran on their machines became essentially theirs.
9002528	9006430	In light of what's happened, what do you think about kind of everything we've been talking about?
9007242	9017465	From what I actually read that story earlier this week, you know, about DigiPen basically, you know, and their policy on owning everything you pretty much submit to them, which is kind of typical.
9018485	9031188	It's kind of typical for how a company operates, you know, where if you're working in software engineering, for example, or any work-for-hire stuff that you do at freelance levels, you pretty much don't own the content, the content.
9031752	9035735	The creator, you know, the actual, the person who commissioned it actually does.
9036476	9040859	In this case, you know, the person commissioning in a software engineering company is the company itself.
9041519	9048785	You know, it needs employees to actually, you know, like me as a software engineer to actually type in the code on the screen and make it work.
9050166	9053969	But, you know, it does, you know, it does worry me somewhat.
9054489	9061074	But then again, I don't, you know, I don't really, I can really understand why they do it just to cover their own asses.
9061775	9073661	in case they want to avoid as much litigation as possible in terms of who owns the IP, the school, or the student.
9073741	9079443	It basically solves a lot of problems before they even creep up.
9080124	9088728	I know it's a sad reality that many people actually submit work and then realize that, oh, oh,
9089181	9099626	Oh crap, I might have used a good idea and then now they're screwed because it's going to take a while to create something much better than what you already submitted because you can't use it anymore because it's someone else who owns it.
9100806	9107369	Zach, I've got another kind of interesting question for you because you talking about having gotten laid off from the mobile company kind of makes me think about this.
9108990	9113472	I don't think I mentioned this earlier in the program, but earlier this week I was actually interviewed by the local news.
9113952	9115753	They were doing a story about the Warcraft launch
9116473	9134161	and they wanted to talk about how video games are like economy they're kind of economy in spite of our falling economy people were still lining up to buy this game you know and I'm using Warcraft as an example but they were kind of talking about how video games were economy they were rescission proof
9134861	9139062	Recession Proof Of course, you have basically game devs that are failing left and right, shutting down, laying off people
9161159	9164581	You know, it's probably because they're not taking in enough money for the games that they're selling.
9165202	9176969	But on the other hand, on the consumer level, you realize that people, you know, games right now are much cheaper than any big-ticket luxury items like iPods or flat-screen TVs.
9177049	9183994	I mean, even the used game market is still thriving right now because of the recession, because people want to play for cheap.
9184474	9190398	That's why, you know, GameStop's making a killing right now with the used games that they have on the, you know,
9191363	9192284	Right there in the bins.
9193744	9197927	Because people want, you know, they want instant satisfaction in that sense.
9198527	9206011	And some of them are willing to save up for something, you know, something like $50 or $60 for like one game, must-have game of this year.
9206872	9211014	You know, personally, I would pick Fallout 3 over Left 4 Dead, but that's just me.
9211634	9212835	But people have their, you know...
9213646	9242510	they're going to be saving up for something for that one thing they want to get this year since the economy is really going under and they're not in a position to actually spend as much as they did last year alright well Zaku we got to wrap up and let you go but any other quick last thoughts for our listeners let me see the arcade scene is not dead it's just going through it just basically got hit in the stomach it's just trying to get up right now let's hope DDR saves it again
9242932	9244175	Alright, Zaku, take care, buddy.
9244215	9244776	Thanks for the call.
9245998	9246960	And good luck on the job hunt.
9248102	9248343	Thanks.
9248623	9249044	Bye.
9249164	9249385	Bye.
9250353	9250913	DarkSakura, Loki, anybody?
9250933	9251754	Last minute stories for us tonight.
9277270	9277930	I like pie.
9278711	9279211	I do too.
9279271	9280231	I want some pumpkin pie.
9280372	9280772	Real bad.
9281192	9283313	Loki, any pie-licious stories for us?
9283753	9287355	No, I don't have pie-licious stories, but this is kind of cheesy.
9288175	9289736	Mmm, cheesecake?
9290016	9291617	You can put cheese on apple pie.
9293338	9298620	Anyways, Uwe Boll has been... No, hold on, hold on.
9298680	9300041	He's not making another movie.
9300181	9302122	Well, at least this is not an announcement of another movie.
9302502	9303903	He's being charged with libel.
9305277	9310680	and is being forced to pay a $2.1 million fine.
9311000	9323707	Apparently, he had badmouthed the Fantastic Films International Company, the very film distributor handling his movies, and now he lost his court case, and so he has to pay money.
9323987	9324448	Oops.
9326529	9327249	So that's kind of funny.
9328450	9328950	Hilarious.
9329771	9330531	Hilarious.
9330651	9332052	That's what he gets for being a dick!
9334545	9337826	and then what else was I looking up here?
9340027	9340547	Not too much.
9340567	9341448	Probably pornography.
9342068	9343068	No, not pornography.
9343128	9347230	I was looking up some old videos of the Half-Life 2 stuff.
9348190	9351752	No, Half-Life Full Life something or other.
9352212	9358014	Anyways, the same guy did some other videos called the Idiots of Gary's Mod and they're hilarious.
9360435	9361675	And I also found a cam
9363917	9366880	I watched it with no sound.
9383001	9386382	Alright, well, sounds like that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9386482	9387223	We've got to wrap up.
9387343	9388103	Get on out of here.
9388223	9389124	In ribbons and bows?
9389244	9390444	That's right, in ribbons and bows.
9391445	9394586	Next week is the week before Thanksgiving, if you can believe it.
9395267	9396328	Time is flying.
9396668	9397568	It's not allowed.
9398789	9400810	No, Rob, you have to be politically correct.
9401110	9402031	It's the holiday.
9402531	9404492	I'm sorry, the Harvest Festival, whatever.
9404853	9407174	You know what?
9407854	9411677	We had a discussion about this in my team meeting at work.
9412377	9415219	They're like, okay, who is offended if we say Christmas?
9415619	9416379	No one raised their hand.
9416599	9417000	Okay!
9418757	9423552	We're calling it whatever we want to in this room, and then we'll call it the holiday.
9424655	9425799	The appreciation.
9426824	9433931	Most Jewish people I've talked to, Jewish being the biggest religion and most obvious one that doesn't do Christmas, they do Hanukkah instead, right?
9434331	9441338	Most Jewish people I know are kind of used to it and don't take personal offense to it and kind of get into the whole celebration thing.
9441358	9442999	You can't celebrate the secular holiday.
9443080	9443460	Exactly.
9443500	9444781	I mean, to be perfectly honest.
9444801	9448765	They get into the Hallmark side of it, but not the meaning behind it necessarily.
9448885	9453368	To be perfectly honest, my own celebration is Yule.
9453408	9456130	If our fireplace wasn't shit, I'd be burning a log every year.
9457251	9458852	It's just whatever.
9460273	9475624	Christmas itself, as most people know it in the Western world, is a secular holiday given a name by the Catholic Church to convert pagans because Jesus was not born in December.
9476104	9476885	It was October.
9478484	9480425	So Halloween is closer to Jesus' birthday?
9480766	9480966	Yes.
9481126	9481966	All right, just curious.
9482087	9483207	It'll be whenever they do the census.
9484388	9488891	All right, look, I don't want to get into religio chat too deep on a video game show.
9488911	9490793	No, I think it's funny, but that's okay.
9491353	9491693	All right.
9493214	9498158	But we'll do our politically incorrect Christmas and deal with it special or something like that.
9498378	9500780	Yes, and Actdeft refers to zombie Jesus.
9504325	9507327	Maybe we'll do a Christmas gaming marathon or politically incorrect.
9507648	9509809	Gaming marathons are the big thing right now.
9510950	9514473	People playing games for hours and hours on end to raise money for charity.
9514793	9516794	We need to do something like that here at Orange Lingerie.
9516814	9517655	I don't know how or when.
9517715	9518395	A play-a-thon?
9518675	9519436	Yeah, a play-a-thon.
9519456	9521437	As long as it's not TDR.
9521457	9523059	We need to play obscure games.
9523239	9524860	We'll let the users vote on what we're going to play.
9525160	9527441	How about, you know what, I should catalog my collection.
9528441	9530382	As long as they don't pick some of the shit that's in my collection.
9530402	9532082	Because I do have some shit in the collection.
9532202	9534063	We should pool like 40 games.
9534763	9536463	Actdeft says Guardian Legend.
9536803	9537544	That can be one of the games.
9537584	9541685	Like every hour, play a new game and let the chatroom vote on what game we play each hour.
9542133	9543714	I'm totally, totally down for that.
9543794	9545054	We should do something like that.
9545074	9545514	It'll be fun.
9545534	9547495	And we'll call it our Christmas marathon.
9551337	9551677	All right.
9552017	9553138	Who called it Jesus Ween?
9554758	9555299	That's great.
9556039	9556299	All right.
9556339	9561701	Anyhow, we'll try to figure out that idea and bring you more on that a little later.
9561721	9563182	And we can open up the studio.
9563202	9564222	I've talked to my roommate about it.
9564242	9567444	We can open up the studio and have people in and out of here throughout the hour and something like that.
9567944	9569225	Anyhow, we gotta wrap up.
9569845	9570625	Get out of here for the night.
9570665	9571946	So everybody's final thought.
