7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco the King!
14000	19000	Tonight, November 16, 2008, Wii music sales are initially disappointing,
19000	22000	an old video game movie is getting upgraded for Blu-ray,
22000	27000	and is LittleBigPlanet bound for the PSP?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello, Internets, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	39000	We are that podcast and live program dedicated to video games,
39000	42000	video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.
46000	51000	Roar. How are you? Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar.
51000	55000	Tonight is the episode where we will be speaking to ourselves in animal speak all night long.
55000	58000	Arf. Meep meep meep meep meep meep meep meep.
58000	64000	Alright. And also say hello to meep meep meep. Awwww. Awwww. Meep meep. Loki.
64000	66000	I'm not participating in this.
66000	69000	No, we have to speak Simlish.
69000	71000	We're speaking Simlish tonight?
71000	72000	Yeah.
72000	74000	Since that is a little more video game related.
74000	77000	Run through a translation filter back into English.
77000	80000	How are you doing, Loki? Seriously though?
80000	81000	Pretty good.
81000	83000	Alright. Good good.
83000	86000	Alright. Well, you know how it works here at Orange Lounge Radio.
86000	90000	We do a little program here for about three hours talking about the latest and greatest in gaming.
90000	95000	You know, the show kind of started as us sitting around the table at dinner after a long night of playing DDR
95000	98000	and fighting games at a local arcade and some pinball and all that good stuff.
98000	100000	Once in a while golf, maybe.
100000	104000	And just talking trash about games and other things going on in our lives.
104000	106000	And kind of carried over onto this little program.
106000	109000	We invite you all to our dinner table through our chat room.
109000	114000	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com when we tape live on Sunday nights at AllGames.com
114000	118000	at about six o'clock Pacific Standard Time right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
118000	122000	Let's start off tonight's show as we always do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?
122000	124000	And we'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
124000	127000	I played something other than Ragnarok.
127000	129000	Although I did play a lot of Ragnarok.
129000	130000	Oh my gosh. What?
130000	133000	I played and you saw me play it.
133000	138000	The Doctor Who Top Trumps game that thanks to one of our lovely listeners sent to me.
138000	140000	Thank you, Rob.
140000	143000	Not this Rob, but that Rob. Thank you.
143000	148000	And something will be on its way to you as soon as I am no longer broke.
148000	151000	But it's cool. I'd never played any Top Trumps game before.
151000	153000	It's kind of, it's really simple.
153000	159000	And I played one of the, I guess, ones in adventure mode.
159000	161000	And I did just a single game.
161000	165000	And I had to play against a Slathine, which was, you know, I was like, eh, I don't like them.
165000	171000	But I lost my first game. It wasn't, it wasn't very, you know, great losing my first game.
171000	173000	But it's sort of like playing War.
173000	180000	But you choose your stats on your card to play against someone else's stats on their card.
180000	185000	And you play for cards too. And it's bizarre. So I, it's weird.
185000	191000	So I'm going to try to practice a bit more at it and see if I can, if I can get any good at it.
191000	197000	And I also have, even though I haven't played it yet, I have a Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
197000	205000	So I'm going to be hopefully giving that a try during the week if I actually have time because I've got two art projects due.
205000	211000	And my Animal Crossing is coming tomorrow. So I'm glad for that.
211000	218000	And I've also been playing a little bit of Fable, Fable 2. So that's it.
218000	221000	Sweet. Have you been playing anything fun?
221000	228000	Um, I guess. Now I played this week, More Saints of War 2, because I've already finished the game.
228000	232000	But I'm going for 100% completions. So I've been playing through the mini games.
232000	236000	Which are actually pretty easy so far. I think some of them are difficult.
236000	244000	Like, um, some of the insurance fraud can be difficult because it's kind of random of what cars come and how many times you can get hit and that kind of thing.
244000	253000	Um, but like I finished the septic adventure part where you spray sewage onto people and property.
253000	257000	And that's funny. Because you fling poo at them.
257000	265000	And um, I also played through some of the helicopter assault stuff which is also fun because you're just firing rockets at things.
265000	274000	Um, then also went and played through some of the online of that. Trying to get some more, um, ranks and badges and stuff.
274000	279000	And I wish it wasn't so cumbersome because to get into the ranked games it takes forever.
279000	285000	And once you're done with that there's no like going back to a lobby or going into another game.
285000	290000	It just kicks you out to the main menu and you have to go through the whole thing again and again.
290000	296000	So that's kind of lame. But um, eventually I'll get enough trophies I guess if I stick with it long enough.
296000	299000	But I am 80% done with the game so that's awesome.
299000	308000	Um, then the other thing I've played this week. Of course we switched to Grand Theft Auto 4 for multiplayer because people got tired of me beating them all the time in Saints Row 2.
308000	314000	So now they want me to beat them all the time in Grand Theft Auto 4. So that's what's been going on.
314000	319000	It's a little tricky to go back to that game because the controls are a little different in Saints Row but I pick it up pretty quick.
319000	331000	And uh, yeah. It's kind of boring. I hope that download content really adds something to the game because once you're done with Grand Theft Auto 4 there's really not much more you can do in there.
331000	339000	Um, then other stuff I played. I got a copy of Mirror's Edge. I haven't really got a chance to play it but I watched my friend play it during lunch one day.
339000	349000	And it looks really awesome. I liked the demo a bit even though it was hard but whatever. It looks fun. So I'm looking forward to checking that out.
349000	355000	I went back and played some Rock Band 2 because I finally got my cymbals for my new drum set.
355000	362000	Because I vowed that I wouldn't play the drum set until I got the cymbals and now that I've got the cymbals it's pretty awesome.
362000	368000	Unfortunately I got only a 2 pack because they weren't selling the 3 packs yet. It sucks.
368000	376000	Um, then I went ahead um, I didn't really get to play Animal Crossing this week but we did get it a little early.
376000	390000	And uh, I've been watching my wife hog the game and you know, I played it at uh, packs and just from what I've seen it really is almost exactly the same as the other 2 games.
390000	396000	Very minor changes and in fact there's a few things that are kind of neat in it but they don't even mention them at all.
396000	402000	Like apparently there's like an easter egg if you're uh, take a certain path each time.
402000	408000	Like say you start the game and immediately run across this one bridge or something. Well eventually it will carve out a path for you.
408000	412000	Um, in the leaves or in the grass or something. So that's kind of a neat little easter egg.
412000	421000	Nice little bit of innovation there. I wish they could have done it with I don't know the important parts of the game instead of like some of the crappy um, visuals.
421000	431000	But seriously I don't think they're trying anymore. At least it seems like with these games that are coming out, I mean, I don't know about you Rob, but doesn't it seem like Nintendo's kind of stopped trying?
431000	437000	Cause with Wii Music it didn't seem like they were really trying too hard there. Animal Crossing doesn't really seem to be that innovative now.
437000	444000	And now they're actually porting GameCube games and adding Wii controls so I mean, how much more lazier can you get? I mean seriously.
444000	448000	I blame the economy. And the stock market and gas prices.
448000	453000	Economy my ass. Seriously, they're just wasting my time.
453000	458000	Um, then I've got a bunch of other stuff to play. Unfortunately I'm getting to the point now where I have too many things to play at once.
458000	467000	Ubisoft sent me a copy of Sean White's Snowboarding for the 360 and then I got a copy of Rain Man's Raving Rabbids TV Party that I got to try out.
467000	478000	And DS games. I'm going to try playing Trackmania DS this week cause I like the PC version. Um, also Linerator 2 at some point.
478000	486000	And I got a download code for Banjo-Kazooie so I'm probably able to try that cause I never really actually played the original.
486000	494000	And, god, Fallout 3 at some point cause I still haven't finished that and I got to finish Fable 2 so it's busy.
494000	502000	But, Animal Crossing does mark the last game I'm buying this year so that's nice. Oh, and Resistance 2. I still got to play that.
502000	509000	Alright, wow, you've been very busy, Loki. Well, in comparison, I've been not as busy.
509000	518000	Pretty much one game has been taking up my entire week. Does anyone, I don't know, just out of curiosity, does anyone want to try and venture a guess what game I might have been playing most of this week?
518000	529000	Sing Star Abba! Uh, no, that's not until December but that will be dominating December. Which I'm very disappointed Loki said he has no more games to buy this year cause there's at least one game left that everyone should be buying and that's Sing Star Abba.
529000	536000	World of Crack Cocaine. Uh, yes, World of Crack Cocaine is Wrath of the Heroine King has been taking up most of my week.
536000	544000	No, obviously we're talking about Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King which the big expansion was released this week and, um, it's great.
544000	556000	I mean, what am I going to say? Obviously I'm already addicted to WoW. What am I going to add to this? I will say this, they've really kind of kicked up a notch this expansion compared to the last one, the Burning Crusade.
556000	564000	Um, they, the new dungeons are pretty awesome, the three I've played so far, um, because the nice thing about them, they're pretty short.
564000	572000	They're not going to take your, you know, two hours like some of the old Burning Crusade ones did and, uh, have a real epic feel for just five people.
572000	587000	Uh, the most recent one I ran, Azul, Azul, Azul Grub, I keep mispronouncing the name, Azul Grub, it's the Spider Palace, um, is actually really awesome because it's nothing but epic boss fights for a five man which is, uh, pretty cool.
587000	595000	And some of the quests are neat, um, they've added this whole new vehicle thing into the game which is kind of fun, kind of controls a little bit differently.
595000	604000	Uh, and I think for lore fans, I'm not huge on the lore in WoW, but I know lore fans are really getting a kick out of this one with some of the twists that are on it.
604000	608000	And, uh, you know, if you're into WoW, you probably already bought this game.
608000	620000	If, um, you're somebody who used to play WoW that's debating coming back, um, you might want to take advantage of that offer that Blizzard's doing where you can get like the ten day free pass to Burning Crusade and all that.
620000	627000	Because I'm going to tell you what, for new people, there's really not a lot in Wrath of the Lich King for you, that's actually probably the game's shortcoming.
627000	636000	Um, whereas in Burning Crusade at least you have Blood Elves, Draenei, kind of, you know, like a way for new folks that are new to the game to experience the new content.
636000	645000	Honestly, Lich King doesn't really have anything for new people. In order to play the new class, the Death Knight, you have to be level 55, uh, already.
645000	654000	If, uh, you want to create, which, you know, for some old school WoW fans might be okay, um, but otherwise, you know, there's not a lot for new people.
654000	663000	There's not a lot you're going to see at level one. Granted, you have a new profession, a haircut thing, but that's not worth 40 bucks for the expansion.
663000	672000	But, um, if you do have a level 70 character, if you've, uh, quit WoW during the Burning Crusade and you're kind of curious what's changed with this, I definitely think Lich King is worth checking out.
672000	680000	So, um, uh, definitely check out Wrath of Lich King, uh, if you're a Warcraft fan. If you're not, there's nothing here that's going to win you, win you over, I don't think.
680000	686000	Although, I do think the questline so far in the dungeons from 70 to 80 have been awesome. And I love the music, too.
686000	692000	The music has been very ambient and pretty awesome. And it has a zone called the Fjord. And who doesn't love the word Fjord?
692000	697000	And yes, it has Vikings and all that stuff, which is pretty awesome. And you get to kill them in the face.
697000	706000	And it's pretty much been my gaming week. I also have gotten to get my grubby little hands on Animal Crossing. Um, I haven't really gotten to play it very much at all.
706000	719000	Um, but I would agree. It's, uh, there's not a lot here we haven't seen. And kind of as I was saying on Bobby's show as we were doing the, um, tossover to our program tonight, um, the GameCube in a way was almost a better deal.
719000	727000	I mean, granted you have the online stuff now. And, you know, there's a few new things here and there. But you don't get to unlock the old school NES games anymore.
727000	733000	And, Loki, when we were talking about it on Bobby's show, you had a great idea for how Animal Crossing kind of put that magic back, right?
733000	740000	Yeah, just, I mean, like they've been doing with some of their other Nintendo games that come out, add some minigames in there. Make some minigames.
740000	753000	You can even make them like retro NES games or something like that. I mean, or even like was it with, um, you know, just have NES demos or something. Hell, they did it with Smash Brothers.
753000	756000	I don't know why that's such a big deal now or just something.
756000	764000	Game & Watch games for heaven's sakes. Just something, you know? Like, I don't know what it is about minigames, but hey, it is Nintendo after all, right?
764000	775000	It just, it seems like that they're not trying, that they're just basically putting in the most basic content ever. And they're making it so that you don't have to play this, you know, multiple times a week or something like that.
775000	782000	Even though you probably should if this is, you know, a game that you're going to be playing. Because that's how you play this, is you have to constantly go back and maintain stuff.
782000	790000	But, like, the city is literally all the, you know, special event stuff that would happen. You know, all the people coming and visiting your town, they're all in the city now.
790000	800000	Which, the city is kind of lame. I wish it was like other villages. Maybe expand your village? Maybe, I don't know, make it look different? Put some effort?
800000	811000	You know, here's what it is. I think, you know, whereas we loved Animal Crossing and the minigames thing I think is important because I remember, I don't know if you remember Dark Sakura, but when we were playing Animal Crossing and visiting each other's towns a lot,
811000	819000	and Loki, of course, we did this too. It was pretty cool because you would be like, well, come over to my house. I have Clu Clu Land in my house. You have to come visit my village so you can play Clu Clu Land.
819000	825000	Oh, yeah? Well, I have, you know, the old school 8-bit pinball game that has Mario, you know.
825000	827000	I remember we had a lot of that going on.
827000	835000	There was incentive to go back and forth and, you know, whereas, you know, at least you still have the items and things. Hey, come visit my shrine of fire and all this stuff.
835000	838000	Honestly, I think Animal Crossing has become a game for 10-year-olds.
838000	849000	Which exclusively for the tween area, like, you know, the 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds. I don't think there's anything left for us old folks anymore.
849000	855000	And what's really, what's the fear of actually putting virtual console games in this game?
855000	861000	Okay, so it may cut down on the sales of your virtual console games that you have featured in this.
861000	870000	Who cares? They're digital. It's not like you have to manufacture discs. It costs you nothing. If anything, you sell more copies of Animal Crossing and you get more people to do it.
870000	874000	Hell, you could maybe even charge them as download content, you know.
874000	880000	Or here's an idea. You know, the virtual console games that you have on your system you can put in your house or something like that.
880000	886000	Or select ones. Like, say, if I own Super Mario Brothers, I can put Super Mario Brothers game in my game or something.
886000	890000	Or I can purchase Super Mario Brothers and put it in my house or something.
890000	893000	It's just, it's lazy. All it is is lazy.
893000	901000	You know, here's the thing about Nintendo. The disappointing thing for me as a hardcore gamer is that Nintendo is still going to sell like hotcakes this Christmas.
901000	906000	Wii's are still going to be a must-have. Wii Fit is still going to sell like crazy. Soccer moms are going to buy this for their kids.
906000	912000	And honestly, things like, you know, look, this has been like a recurring trend on this show.
912000	916000	We bashed Wii music previously and said, but it's probably really good for 10-year-olds.
916000	921000	Here we are bashing Animal Crossing. But your 10-year-old will probably have a lot of fun with it.
921000	926000	Why would I get Wii Fit? I won't probably exercise much with it, but my 10-year-old probably will.
926000	932000	Wii, the Wii is not being taken seriously by a lot of us hardcore gamers anymore. It's the kids' system.
932000	935000	Remember though they were saying... Will it still sell? Sure.
935000	939000	But they're going to lose a lot of credibility with us if they don't start turning around some games fast in 2009.
939000	943000	And to lose that brand loyalty is going to be painful.
943000	947000	Well, here's the thing. Remember before the GameCube, it was looked at as a kids' system.
947000	952000	The Wii hasn't changed that at all. In fact, now they're really pushing it.
952000	958000	That it's more of a kids' system or a casual game system. That's great, you know, if you want to make it for that.
958000	964000	But you know there's people that play that that may want an actual game that's a little bit more hardcore or a little bit more...
964000	970000	Just, there's things you can do to make the games appeal to casual players and not-so-casual players.
970000	975000	Animal Crossing can still be very fun for a casual player, but change it! God damn it! Seriously!
975000	979000	Just change it! Make it different than the last two that you've put out!
979000	982000	It's exactly... Can you imagine if Super Mario Bros. 3 came out?
982000	986000	It was exactly the same as Super Mario Bros. 1 except it was a night or something.
986000	988000	That's seriously what they're doing. It's just the same...
988000	989000	With Wii Speak.
989000	995000	Yeah, it's seriously that bad. It's just they're not trying at all.
995000	1001000	And the sad thing is it's because it's Animal Crossing and people will buy it and they're not going to learn.
1001000	1004000	Okay, I've got to go to the chat room because there's some great comments in chat.
1004000	1005000	Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
1005000	1009000	Frisbee starts us off tonight. Who in the freaking hell cares about ten-year-olds?
1009000	1019000	Well, not us necessarily, but a sale of a Nintendo Wii and Animal Crossing and Wii Fit to a ten-year-old's mother is still a sale.
1019000	1021000	It's still money in Nintendo's pocket.
1021000	1026000	That's fine if ten-year-olds are happy with Animal Crossing because maybe they didn't play the other versions of the game. That's fine.
1026000	1031000	But they'll be equally disappointed when Animal Crossing 2 or whenever the next one comes out for the next Nintendo system.
1031000	1033000	They're like, holy crap, this is exactly the same as the last one I played.
1033000	1037000	And we'll be going, holy crap, it's exactly the same as the last three I've played.
1037000	1045000	Quel Tipo in chat says, yeah, but at least GameCube had the debut of Resident Evil 4 to combat the supposed kiddiness and eternal darkness too.
1045000	1055000	It still looks like a Nintendo 64 game. I mean, that's really, I have the Nintendo 64 version, so it's just, that's all it is.
1055000	1062000	It doesn't even have to be the look. It's just they didn't change, the towns are exactly, I mean, basically the same as the other ones.
1062000	1065000	But maybe they're just saying the formula works, why mess with it?
1065000	1072000	Because I really don't have a lot of incentive to buy this game, although I guess I already have it, but, you know, to recommend it to others.
1072000	1082000	Here's a very interesting counterpoint to your whole Mario at Night thing. Game Guru says someone hasn't played Lost Levels, which was Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan.
1082000	1087000	In a way, Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan was but Mario at Night.
1087000	1089000	But the levels were different.
1089000	1092000	And he did have poison mushrooms, a difference between Mario and Luigi and so on.
1092000	1093000	Exactly.
1093000	1094000	But the look was the same.
1094000	1097000	It doesn't matter. The look can be the same for Animal Crossing.
1097000	1102000	I have no problem with the look. The look can be exactly the same, but add something, make some little bit of a variety.
1102000	1106000	Add forests in there, add where you can travel to other towns within your town.
1106000	1111000	It's not necessarily just one town, but like a community of towns, like a state or something, you know?
1111000	1115000	Yet another great comment from Jenai in chat. Chat room's got great comments tonight.
1115000	1120000	Jenai in chat says Nintendo is really pissing on its fans for not bringing Mother 3 out.
1120000	1122000	That's a great comment.
1122000	1128000	So meanwhile, while they're cranking out these games, they've got a game that might appeal to us that they refuse to release here in the US.
1128000	1130000	Amazing.
1130000	1135000	Alright, well anyhow, that's pretty much going to do it for my gaming week.
1135000	1142000	Let's get into some housekeeping news tonight, of which we don't have an awful lot, but I do want to make sure I announce here, towards the top of the show,
1142000	1145000	we have a special guest joining us tonight. It's going to be awesome.
1145000	1153000	I know you guys have heard about the Xbox 360 new Xbox experiences coming out pretty soon, this next coming week.
1153000	1158000	Well one thing that's going to be rolling out on this is the community games on the Xbox 360.
1158000	1163000	You might remember when these things were first previewed a few months ago at the Game Developers Conference, I said,
1163000	1170000	this is it. This is going to be a huge thing. This is going to be like the YouTube for video games. This is going to be huge.
1170000	1177000	And well, it's yet to be seen because it sure seems like Microsoft's not really selling this very much compared to the Netflix and the Avatars,
1177000	1182000	but it doesn't mean the community games aren't out there and it doesn't mean there's not going to be a lot of them at the day of release.
1182000	1191000	We have the author of one of them on the program tonight, Aaron Teplitzki, who made Snake 360, is going to be joining us in part B of our show tonight,
1191000	1198000	to talk about Snake 360 and yes, it's the old school, not that snake, it's the old school Snake game from like, you know,
1198000	1202000	like, I don't know if we're supposed to say this, but like, you know, the Nokia phones and the Snake game,
1202000	1209000	but it's like a whole new version of it. You won't even recognize it. Like, it's got so much more, like 50 modes and all this stuff.
1209000	1216000	It's insanely cool. Snake360.com if you want to read up on that before he comes on the program a little later.
1216000	1220000	There's some trailers and stuff and we'll be asking him more about the game in a little while.
1220000	1229000	And also, very interesting connection between this game and music games that we've talked about in the past.
1229000	1234000	And we'll talk about that a little later. Meanwhile, that's really it for housekeeping.
1234000	1238000	Otherwise, I'm just going to say, hey, join us on Facebook at OL Army, join us on MySpace,
1238000	1243000	Orange Lounge Radio, and join us on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge, and Twitter at OLR.
1243000	1250000	And this week, I will not ignore the pre-OLR Twit like I did last week, and I apologize for that.
1250000	1257000	I will read your Twits tonight when we get to that story on Samba de Amigo, but we're not ready for that yet.
1257000	1261000	We're going to get some other stories first, and Loki is going to start us off tonight.
1261000	1264000	That's right. It should be called Show Us Your Twits.
1264000	1269000	I like that. I think that should be the official name of the song. You like that, Dark Soccer? I like that.
1269000	1272000	Sure. Show us your Twits.
1272000	1275000	Very good, Loki. Quite clever tonight.
1275000	1281000	Anyways, so kind of going into what we were just talking about, disappointment in Nintendo.
1281000	1285000	Wii Music has definitely been disappointing for Nintendo.
1285000	1290000	It's actually only sold so far, not even 100,000 units.
1290000	1297000	Only 81,000 units according to the NPD, or according to Nintendo, 65,000 to 66,000 units.
1297000	1308000	I don't know. I can see why, because the game itself, really there's no point to it.
1308000	1316000	I mean, it's a toy. Something that could have been literally downloaded on their WiiWare service, which it probably should have been.
1316000	1322000	Jamie, you were the lone holdout for Wii Music on this program. Did you get a chance to check it out yet?
1322000	1330000	No. That's alright. Because I've had school. I was just curious. Honestly, better games to play.
1330000	1333000	So, finally you're admitting it. There are better things out there.
1333000	1341000	No, I admitted it from the beginning that there were better things to play. I just, you know, said that I liked it. I thought it was cute.
1341000	1346000	My inner musician sang out and went, cool, I did this crap in music theory.
1346000	1354000	I say it's great, too, for 10-year-olds. But, anyway, I don't think a 10-year-old would even want to play this.
1354000	1361000	I'm sorry. This is for like 5-year-olds. It's for kids that shake around shit and that don't know what they're doing.
1361000	1366000	In a game, they're like, oh my goodness, I'm making music. But, hey, you know what? That's cool.
1366000	1375000	Because sometimes, you know, the parents want to go talk and have adult conversations, whereas the little kids are screaming and being annoying and, you know, put them in front of this and they'll shut up.
1375000	1381000	Now, is the numbers here skewed a little bit because this game came out late in the month? I mean, it really doesn't-
1381000	1382000	I think so.
1382000	1388000	To be honest, 81,000 doesn't sound like a bad number to me. I mean, maybe it's under expectations, but you consider-
1388000	1389000	Well, this is a number-
1389000	1393000	There's been other music games out there, like, probably BeatMania didn't sell that much, sadly.
1393000	1400000	Well, this was released, this is basically one week worth of sales, because this was released in the second to last week of the month.
1400000	1406000	But, to be honest, from what I've seen, it's not selling very well at all.
1406000	1407000	Interesting.
1407000	1420000	So, it's just- I don't know. I think people- once again, they're trying to find games that the people that buy the Wii system for Wii Sports would possibly buy.
1420000	1428000	That is really their challenge right now, is what can we do to get people to buy games that really don't want to buy other games other than Wii Sports?
1428000	1429000	Wii Lacrosse.
1429000	1430000	Well, the first-
1430000	1431000	Wii Sports 2.
1431000	1441000	Yeah, seriously. That is what they've come up with, is Wii Sports Resort. It's more Wii Sports. Awesome! It's what you've always wanted.
1441000	1449000	But, Wii Music was another thing that was supposed to be similar to that, where, you know, hey, look at that, the whole family can play music, and it's fun for the whole family.
1449000	1455000	And then, the parents are like, well, Wii Sports is fun for the whole family, and I'm not really bored with that yet.
1455000	1462000	Funny point from YYR in chat, Wii Music has sold more copies than Rock Revolution, in fact.
1462000	1465000	We won't go there with Rock Revolution.
1465000	1469000	That's a whole other can of worms. Let's move on, shall we?
1469000	1472000	Folks are kicking Nintendo while they're down, apparently.
1472000	1481000	Motiva is an Ohio-based company, and they've, of course, filed a lawsuit, yet another one, against Nintendo, saying that the Wiimote is violating their patent.
1481000	1495000	They filed it in 2004, technology used to create a human movement measurement system that will use a handheld tracking device in communication with a base station that is then used to create an interactive gaming experience, among other capabilities.
1495000	1502000	Now, here's what I want to know. Is Nintendo's getting sued by all these people that claim they have the patent for, like, the Wii Remote and stuff?
1502000	1509000	How can everybody have the patent for the Wii Remote? Because there's all these people that are suing them, saying that they have patents for this stuff.
1509000	1515000	Shouldn't they be suing each other because now they have patents that also kind of overlap? It's weird.
1515000	1517000	Yeah, that's the part I don't really get, either.
1517000	1520000	Yeah, right. All these people are claiming we invented the Wii years ago.
1520000	1525000	Well, we invented the Wii Remote. Well, no, we just paid a settlement to this other company and said they invented the Wii Remote.
1525000	1528000	You need to dish it out with them, then, because they're the ones that actually claim that...
1528000	1531000	I am Spartacus. No, I am Spartacus.
1531000	1536000	No, I am Spartacus. Yeah, it's just really ridiculous.
1536000	1545000	And it's also, it's like, oh my god, we didn't realize they were so similar two years after it came out.
1545000	1551000	I'd be really curious to see what happens with one of these lawsuits, because we keep hearing about, oh, somebody's suing them, somebody's suing them,
1551000	1555000	yet we haven't heard about, really, anybody winning or losing yet.
1555000	1562000	Yeah, it's basically, it's like, yeah, we created the Wii Remote, we want you to pay up.
1562000	1568000	Well, I think we created the Wii Remote, and all these hundreds of thousands of dollars say we did.
1568000	1571000	Okay, yes, you created the Wii Remote. Thank you very much.
1571000	1576000	You know, it's interesting, though, but in kind of like the reverse news, I was reading something interesting this week that was talking about,
1576000	1584000	I don't remember who it was, I think it was TiVo or somebody, was saying that if they need to incorporate Nintendo Wii technology into televisions,
1584000	1586000	things that people do on their TVs.
1586000	1593000	They're going to basically incorporate the design of the remote so that instead of having, you know, 50 billion buttons or whatever,
1593000	1597000	it's going to be motion sensitive and you're going to point at stuff on the screen.
1597000	1599000	Nintendo will sue.
1599000	1602000	Yes, we called TiVo for comment, and this is what they had to say.
1602000	1604000	No, it's funny, TiVo will-
1604000	1605000	I was telling a joke!
1605000	1606000	Sorry.
1606000	1609000	I have to reset that joke now, excuse me.
1609000	1612000	Well, in Soviet Russia, joke telling.
1612000	1616000	We called TiVo this week to get a comment on this story, and you know what they told us?
1616000	1618000	I am Spartacus.
1618000	1622000	Okay, well, I don't feel bad now for interrupting that joke.
1622000	1632000	No, I was going to see what's going to be an interesting turn of events when TiVo sues Nintendo over the technology for a pointer and, you know, that kind of an error face.
1632000	1637000	We'll see. We'll see. It's just lawsuit after lawsuit in the world. Can't we all just get along?
1637000	1642000	No, it's not allowed to. Don't you know that war is the true way of things?
1642000	1645000	Actually, it's not, but still.
1645000	1647000	War is population control.
1647000	1654000	So, Nintendo is being sneaky. Very, very sneaky.
1654000	1662000	And their sneakiness will definitely fool a few people, but they haven't said anything about it efficiently-
1662000	1671000	Officially. Nor have they actually, you know, put any kind of thing on their site, from what I understand.
1671000	1682000	So, it was actually seen at Target. It's official. It is a multiplayer control set, is what it's called.
1682000	1693000	There is a Mario Kart wheel, Wii Remote, and Nunchuck, and it's $74.99, which is actually more expensive than getting them all individually.
1693000	1695000	That's awesome.
1695000	1697000	Yeah.
1697000	1698000	That's sweet.
1698000	1708000	Two cents more, according to Kotaku, but at the same time, it's like, okay, why? Why do you even need the damn wheel?
1708000	1714000	Actually, no. I think that's more than that, because I think the wheel itself is only $10, although some people charge $15 for it.
1714000	1718000	Depends on where you go, but I think they're going over official retail price.
1718000	1726000	Well, officially, it's supposed to be $10, so it's actually $5 more expensive than buying them separately, I think.
1726000	1733000	In fact, I will- well, I don't know why I'm looking at GameStop's website, but I think they have theirs for $15.
1733000	1739000	I know we sell them for $10, but that's just funny.
1739000	1746000	But, yeah, another kind of holiday gift thing. I mean, you really don't need the Wii Wheel, but I guess people have trouble-
1746000	1752000	Oh, no! We have to have the Wii Wheel, or we don't have the proper grip on the thingy!
1752000	1757000	Yeah, the Wii Wheel sells for $14.99. I thought it was supposed to be $10.
1757000	1763000	I know that I've seen two different SRPs from them, and one was $14.99, and one was $10.
1763000	1767000	But, I think they're supposed to be $10, but people still charge $15, because guess what?
1767000	1770000	People don't know better, and they will buy it for $15.
1770000	1773000	That's because people are dumbasses.
1773000	1778000	Okay, I have to admit something. Through the magic radio, you may not have even known I was gone, but I had to run in the house.
1778000	1783000	I've had a migraine, and I don't remember if I said that at the top of the show, so I was making myself some coffee so I could have some caffeine, because that's good for headaches.
1783000	1789000	What the hell is so damn funny? I heard you literally laughing all the way in the house.
1789000	1797000	That their combo, that their bundle here with one remote nunchuck and a Wii Wheel is actually more expensive than buying them all separately.
1797000	1800000	That is pretty funny.
1800000	1802000	I have a bagel.
1802000	1805000	So, I also ran in to get Jamie a bagel.
1805000	1815000	And really, why should you buy this in a big old bundle like this, when I'm sure right next to all of them are the individual components separate of each other?
1815000	1820000	It's just stupid, but whatever. Can't hurt them for trying.
1820000	1824000	I'm sure that's probably one of those Target exclusive sets or something like that.
1824000	1828000	I didn't say anything on the box. It's official Nintendo stuff.
1828000	1835000	Oh yeah, but sometimes I know with Activision they make special bundles for Guitar Hero and stuff like that for different retailers.
1835000	1843000	And it won't say a Target exclusive or whatever, but it's made exclusively for those retailers.
1843000	1846000	Oh my god, the room smells like caffeine.
1846000	1847000	Sorry.
1847000	1848000	No, it's good.
1848000	1850000	Sorry. You want some? Well, I can have some more.
1850000	1852000	No, I gotta be up at work at six in the morning.
1852000	1856000	I know. Now I'm never gonna be able to go to sleep tonight. That's okay, I can stay up and play. Wow.
1856000	1870000	Well, speaking of innovation, Nintendo has revealed their 2009 lineup, or early 2009 basically for the first quarter, I should say, of the year for Japan.
1870000	1877000	And here's what we can probably expect over here sometime soon after that.
1877000	1886000	They've got a few things that they've already teased at Tokyo Game Show. Mario & Luigi RPG 3 is scheduled to come out February 11th to the DS.
1886000	1890000	Okay, now there's a good game. Yes, that's a cool game.
1890000	1893000	Castlevania Judgment, they're getting it a little bit late.
1893000	1899000	And Play for Wii Mario Tennis coming January 15th.
1899000	1907000	That Play for Wii Tennis, or Play for Wii Mario Tennis is the port of the GameCube game with Wii controls now.
1907000	1915000	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time will be coming to both DS and Wii on January 29th.
1915000	1923000	And also not listed on there would be Sin and Punishment 2 and Punch Out.
1923000	1926000	But maybe soon after that?
1926000	1931000	I'm assuming. Sin and Punishment was originally a Japanese game, so it's kind of weird they're not getting it first.
1931000	1938000	Well, it's just not listed on the first, you know, they list only a few months at a time, so obviously it's after that.
1938000	1943000	Quel Tipo gives a nice, mature summary of the 2009 lineup for Nintendo.
1943000	1946000	Yay Mario & Luigi, fart to everything else.
1946000	1953000	I don't know, Punch Out might be kind of cool, even if they're just capitalizing on Wii Sports, the boxing game.
1953000	1956000	You know, I didn't realize Punch Out had been re-released so many times.
1956000	1960000	Like, they've had different versions for the Super Nintendo and stuff like that.
1960000	1963000	The Super Nintendo one was awesome! It was kind of underrated.
1963000	1973000	It might be pretty neat, but, you know, I don't have much faith in Nintendo just because of the example of the products that have come out recently.
1973000	1976000	It's just, it doesn't seem like they're trying.
1976000	1978000	Well, Sin and Punishment might be pretty cool, because the first one was fun.
1978000	1983000	Punishment looks awesome, but it, you know, it just doesn't look like they're trying.
1983000	1988000	Like, the stuff that's developed in-house just doesn't seem to be that good.
1988000	1992000	Alright, well, then maybe they'll have to leave it to some of the third party.
1992000	1996000	And one of those third parties teasing a project this week is Squeenix, Square Enix.
1996000	1999000	Blood of Bahamut is a project that they were teasing this week.
1999000	2003000	They had a weird countdown thingy on their website.
2003000	2008000	And, finally, it appears it's been confirmed in a magazine, Shonen Jump, in Japan.
2008000	2011000	Blood of Bahamut is the game that they're teasing.
2011000	2014000	Shonen Jump is a manga compilation.
2014000	2017000	Oh, okay. How much did they talk about video games in there?
2017000	2019000	There's ads for stuff and little articles in there.
2019000	2023000	Well, for whatever reason, this game got the jump on Blood of Bahamut, which is the game that Squeenix is teasing.
2023000	2031000	It's a DS game, and apparently what you do, you can play this game with four people locally, and you defend your city from attacks.
2031000	2033000	So it's like a city defense game.
2033000	2037000	Apparently, though, you, like, build them on a creature or something?
2037000	2040000	At least that's what the teaser image kind of makes it look like.
2040000	2042000	So there'll be more information from this game soon.
2042000	2043000	That's where Bahamut comes into things.
2043000	2044000	I'm assuming.
2044000	2048000	We'll be hearing more on this game soon, but who knows if it's coming to the US or not.
2048000	2054000	I would assume it is, because Squeenix has gotten a little better about their whole universal game, you know, worldwide game thing.
2054000	2059000	Especially if Last Remnants any indication, which, god damn, there's another game I gotta play this holiday season.
2059000	2060000	Oh, yeah.
2060000	2062000	It's like SimCity of the Colossus.
2062000	2070000	So there you go. I'm sure there's a lot of Squeenix fans who are gonna be curious to check this one out.
2070000	2074000	But yet again, another kind of interesting game for the DS.
2074000	2076000	Why is the DS getting all the love?
2076000	2080000	I guess it's because more people own DS's than anything else, but...
2080000	2083000	I don't know.
2083000	2086000	You know, it's just like I was saying last week when I was talking about Order of Aclasia.
2086000	2088000	Why can't we have these games on consoles?
2088000	2090000	I wanna play them on my television.
2090000	2092000	Not when I'm lying in my bed playing my DS.
2092000	2094000	They should make a DS TV tuner.
2094000	2096000	Yes and no.
2096000	2106000	Like, I think the idea is cool in theory, but at the same time I want them to, you know, have like a platformer like the type of thing you'd see on the DS.
2106000	2113000	But with that LittleBigPlanet style graphics, you know, really sharp, good looking, you know, use the high end graphics.
2113000	2117000	They already have a TV tuner for the DS in Japan.
2117000	2121000	And they also have it if you review games and you're, you know, putting together professional stuff.
2121000	2123000	But the rest of us?
2123000	2125000	Yeah, if we have a DS dev kit.
2125000	2127000	Huh. Exactly.
2127000	2129000	Like we'd ever get one of those.
2129000	2132000	You know what? It could happen.
2132000	2135000	You never know. It would never happen.
2135000	2141000	So, well, let's move on and talk about some release dates and some of the games we will be getting our hands on a little bit sooner.
2141000	2143000	We'll start with our friends over in Europe, right, Jamie?
2143000	2148000	Exactly. For our UK releases. And this is stuff that we may or may not get our hands on.

2150000	2156000	On the 18th is, excuse me, is Evercrack 2 The Shadow Odyssey.

2262000	2265000	Left 4 Dead coming out on the 360.

2304000	2305000	Black Wolf says,
2305000	2306000	Loki, you just misspoke.
2306000	2309000	You stated that Animal Crossing was a new game that came out on the Wii this week.
2309000	2312000	Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake. Please correct yourself.
2312000	2316000	Animal Crossing Wild World, I mean City Folk.
2316000	2321000	The game that you may have seen in other systems now is being printed for the Wii.
2321000	2322000	Yes.
2322000	2327000	The first game in the Let's Make GameCube Games for the Wii game has come out this week,
2327000	2328000	and it's called Animal Crossing City Folk.
2328000	2331000	Oh, no. That's not the first game either.
2331000	2334000	No. Must I remind you of Resident Evil 4?

2390000	2394000	that really get shit on by the public, but I'm fucking curious about it.
2394000	2396000	Like, I want to buy it just to kind of check it out.
2396000	2401000	They want you to make your judgment on it and judge with your wallet and do not buy it.
2401000	2405000	Or if you are planning on buying it, wait a few weeks for it to really suck
2405000	2407000	and then to drop the price on it.
2407000	2408000	Find it used?
2408000	2409000	Yes.
2409000	2411000	Maybe I can find Rock Revolution used now.

2448000	2451000	There's a game called Nipple?
2451000	2456000	It's NPPL, National Paintball Players League.
2459000	2462000	Nipple's the game!
2462000	2468000	Yes, we watched your- show us your Twits on Nipple.
2468000	2470000	Agatha Christie's Evil Under the-
2470000	2474000	It would probably sell more than Rock Revolution based on name alone.
2474000	2476000	You know, to be honest, the game looks like-
2476000	2478000	I'm doing the game of Nipple, who cares?

2510000	2515000	Oh, guess what? Rock Revolution with the drum kit's finally coming out, only a month late.
2515000	2520000	And that'll be on PS3 and Xbox 360, but really, why even bother?
2520000	2523000	And Tony Hawk's Motion on DS.

2548000	2553000	Which, by the way, Loki played it at PAX on stage in front of everyone. Comedy.
2553000	2560000	Yes, I wanted to play the actual part where you can slide around on the moose using the Wii balance board.
2560000	2562000	And you sit on it and lean back and forth.
2562000	2570000	Oh, yeah, sure, you can play that after you play this dancing game with some chicks with the frag dolls.
2570000	2572000	Oh, and we're gonna videotape you.
2572000	2576000	Oh, and then when you're done, we're gonna say, fuck off, and you're not gonna get to play the actual thing you wanted to play.
2576000	2578000	You know what was great about that whole thing?
2578000	2584000	Is that you were there to play something else that was being horribly ignored by everybody.
2584000	2587000	And you were really excited to check out a different game at the booth, right?
2587000	2588000	I don't remember what it was.
2588000	2590000	I wanted to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids because...
2590000	2593000	But there's something else in the booth that you went over there first to go play.
2593000	2594000	It was at PAX.
2594000	2599000	Yeah, I think that's what it was. And then a cute girl came up and was like, hi, you wanna play Rayman's Raving Rabbids?
2599000	2603000	No, I asked...
2603000	2607000	I wanted to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids because that's individuals thing I wanted to do when I got there.
2607000	2610000	But I didn't wanna play the dance game. Like, I wanna play that one.
2610000	2615000	I've done the dance game of the other one and it was, guess what, not much different than this one.

2851760	2854760	looks like it's some type of board game translation that's coming out in Japan
2854760	2857600	kind of like I guess you could say a Mario Party ish game but it looks like
2857600	2863360	there's some like RPG elements in that game doesn't look half bad though coming
2863360	2867280	out on the handheld systems are actually let's take a look quick at PlayStation 2
2867280	2870520	because some folks still have that you also get another version of mercenaries

2875360	2882200	from yeti that's he me my bad remember that's part of the reason why I do this

2887480	2890960	this is probably the game that most folks are waiting for not just in Japan

2953080	2957400	suit Gundam game Gundam vs. Gundam and it even comes with its own PSP pack if
2957400	2961780	you want to check that out so like a Gundam remake of spy vs. spy no my
2961780	2966280	friend calls it Gundam also I think this is kind of neat I think it's like a
2966280	2971440	Disgaea spin-off because a game has come out all about prettys yes this week on
2971440	2977840	the PSP pretty or a guy shoe jinkoo day any suka comes out this week I think you
2977840	2981800	can be a hero too or something like that it's it's coming out in the u.s. to in
2981800	2988200	February you get 1,000 lives in this game that's it's a side-scroller action
2988200	2992120	game and your character has literally 1,000 lives I hope it's really hard
2992120	2996200	because I'd be funny it must be but you know prettys were kind of disposable
2996200	2998680	and Disgaea so that is kind of funny that actually sounds like kind of a
2998680	3003400	funny game so I might have to check that one out all right that's gonna do it for
3003400	3007400	Japanese releases this week I hope that I hope that game gets supported for the
3007400	3012120	u.s. that's like it does that's all three games you wary okay I was just saying
3012120	3016000	my bad but that's like three games I've talked about they're coming out in Japan
3016000	3021360	that I would love to see come out in the u.s. so game challenge which I forget
3021360	3025640	what it's called like something God I remember the Japanese version of it it's
3025640	3030960	like Game Center CX or something like that in Japan but the retro game
3030960	3037120	challenges coming here it's a bunch of fake retro games and I think it's a
3037120	3041120	little bit like Warioware all right let's move on with some other gaming
3041120	3045720	news well this is particularly exciting stuff speaking of other release dates
3045720	3052000	Street Fighter 4 has a date for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 actually
3052000	3059160	you're saying that it's going to be February 20th 2009 so there's also some
3059160	3064120	reports saying that there's going to be 25 characters in the console release and
3064120	3067120	maybe some other fun stuff so who knows
3067120	3073600	cool and I'm looking forward to playing Street Fighter 4 very much oh and
3073600	3076640	there's actually though there's a mention of the PC version but no really
3076640	3082440	state for that yeah and while it's coming out in Europe on February 20th we
3082440	3087400	will be getting it in the u.s. three days earlier on February 17th then we'll be
3087400	3092280	also coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well and we'll feature
3092280	3099600	actually I think some console exclusive characters including Sakura yay wasn't
3099600	3102400	there something about this game is actually not gonna be coming to arcades
3102400	3106880	though over here which is kind of sad I don't think it is according I don't know
3106880	3109840	why they wouldn't bring it over here it'd be awesome you know what we just
3109840	3113020	hate arcades you know what you know what we're gonna see it at Sunnyvale
3113020	3118760	golf land you know we're gonna I'm sure we're gonna see it yeah well it is
3118760	3122320	popping up around the u.s. I mean folks are importing and I know I I think some
3122320	3124680	of our New York listeners called in several weeks ago to talk about it but
3124680	3127640	you know it's just kind of sad it's not getting an official quote-unquote
3127640	3131160	release in the u.s. okay so it wasn't really stopped a lot of people nowadays
3131160	3134640	maybe because it's coming out on the consoles and when games come out on
3134640	3138760	consoles it kind of kills the arcade release unless it's you know during the
3138760	3144600	owners club or DDR you can do it right I mean if developers are smart enough to
3144600	3148840	incorporate things that you can tie into consoles like for example DDR with edit
3148840	3154760	data or you know f0 GX with you know data that you can port to the arcade
3154760	3161800	and that kind of stuff I think if they do it smart both can benefit from it all
3161800	3165520	right well hey Street Fighter fans if you are a hardcore Street Fighter fan
3165520	3168600	you gotta be really hardcore Street Fighter fan to appreciate this or if you
3168600	3172200	just like bad movies like me you're gonna be excited that Street Fighter the
3172200	3176840	movie is coming out on blu-ray yes that's right the Jean-Claude Van Damme
3176840	3182000	Raul Julia and most importantly Kylie Minogue is cami Street Fighter movie is
3182000	3187640	coming out on blu-ray it's an extreme edition of the Street Fighter movie and
3187640	3192440	it's so sad but true that this is Raul Julia's last movie but you can
3192440	3194920	experience it one more day he actually was the best thing about the movie I
3194920	3198480	even remember this 20 years later you know well not quite that much but like
3198480	3201200	15 20 years later but he was the best thing about that movie and the rest of
3201200	3204800	it was complete cheese ball me was great really that's true Kylie Minogue was
3204800	3207600	pretty awesome it's pretty great to see her in the movie I think the reason that
3207600	3211520	this movie's coming out now or soon I guess well the tie-in with all the other
3211520	3216040	Street Fighter crap well yes and also to make it seem like that the new movie
3216040	3219520	isn't as bad as it really is because you watch this movie these they'll be really
3219520	3223200	holy crap that's awesome you know where is the average person see you can go
3223200	3233200	yeah not great very good point it's like thank God it's not you know thank God
3233200	3238120	didn't kill any good actors in this one I will say this though and not to spoil
3238120	3242240	anything about the movie but the very last thing in the entire movie the
3242240	3246920	little pose they all do at the very end it's by far the best part because it's
3246920	3252340	so fucking cheesy good question from frisbee and chat chat on orange on
3252340	3256600	radio.com can we expect Street Fighter the movie the game I don't think so
3256600	3260880	considering some of the people who were in development of that game have come
3260880	3264360	out and now spoken about why the game was such crap like I don't think you're
3264360	3266680	ever gonna see that game again I think that's the type of thing they've kind of
3266680	3270800	swept under the rug and would like to leave there so thanks for reminding them
3270800	3274200	of such painful memories you want to play Street Fighter the movie the game
3274200	3281000	you just need to go find maim sha 100 Matt says they are making that Street
3281000	3287160	Fighter the later years into a TV show I would like to see a Street Fighter
3287160	3293920	sitcom that would be pretty funny anyhow it's just wrong let's see if we have
3293920	3297320	anything wrong wrong wrong in our email bag this week every week you send us
3297320	3301000	emails at mailbag at orange launch radio.com and dark soccer likes to read
3301000	3306040	some of the emails live on air that's just what she's gonna do this week well
3306040	3310280	this week I have a surprise twist but I'll reveal that after dark soccer is
3310280	3317120	done well I would do it if my email would pull out so just give me a second
3317120	3327800	there we go who we have a stunning total of one email and it awesome but as a
3327800	3331040	reminder that email address is mailbag at orange launch radio.com if you want
3331040	3335840	to give dark dark soccer some work to do yes it yes it is so this comes from geek
3335840	3341640	boy hey guys for episode 300 I sent an email and you asked how old I am my
3341640	3346320	13th birthday is going to be on the 23rd yes my parents know I listen don't freak
3346320	3353480	out so sacramax beat that fatality this is Jamie I'm on Twitter so please give
3353480	3358120	me the JSRF soundtrack info on there and yes I know I have typed this horribly
3358120	3363920	but I am too lazy to type slowly sorry this is orange lounge exclamation points
3363920	3372520	a lot done all right I would just be happier if you actually used to do you
3372520	3376640	spelled just like everything right so I'm not sure just using your shift key
3376640	3382720	to capitalize stuff okay all right here's the twist in tonight's mailbag I
3382720	3387100	got one in my personal email that asked me to read it on the air so since we
3387100	3390120	only had one email I'll go ahead and read that now I don't know why they
3390120	3392680	wanted me to read it instead of you but I think it's because it involves audio
3392680	3400220	cues tonight so this email comes to us from Rini tonight and here's here's what
3400220	3405860	it is greetings to you olr listeners but the pleasantries will end there once the
3405860	3411320	following is read pyramid head is inferior that's a pretty controversial
3411320	3414680	statement right there on this program pyramid head is inferior pyramid head
3414680	3418360	may be near and dear to many of your hearts but I mean no ill will if anything
3418360	3423320	I want to expose everyone to something more creepy and superior games with a
3423320	3427360	horror theme may have their most memorable monsters and moments but I
3427360	3431000	believe that there is one out there to best them all and it comes from earth
3431000	3435240	bound yes the old Super Nintendo game with Ness in it before I continue I'd
3435240	3438320	like to put up the old spoiler warning here since what I'm referring to is the
3438320	3443040	final boss of earthbound spoiler warning at the end of earthbound Ness
3443040	3448040	Ness faces Giygas an enemy that has been inhabited by by the very manifestation
3448040	3451300	of evil and has become a formless swirling massive red and black as the
3451300	3454760	fight progresses Giygas becomes more erratic and unsettling the fight itself
3454760	3458400	is disturbing even by today's standards and it's a Super Nintendo game to boot
3458400	3463000	the parallax sprite of Giygas has a fetus in it the audio in the fight is
3463000	3468280	the actual boss itself and Giygas's speech is just plain creepy truly an
3468280	3472800	experience in itself here's some a little clip of actually what that might
3472800	3485160	look like that's actually a little creepy sound that Giygas makes that is
3485160	3489880	a little bit creepy and if that wasn't bad enough consider the fact that there
3489880	3493520	is complete leftover data for a potentially creepier rematch against
3493520	3497360	Giygas and mother three what was found was a sequence of imagery that gets
3497360	3499920	progressively disturbing as the fight would have progressed if one were to
3499920	3504760	play it wouldn't you get freaked out if you are fighting the hollow red outline
3504760	3508320	image of a dead relative's face with people as eyes and mouth gaping wide
3508320	3514320	open right and there's audible speech for this iteration of Giygas
3514720	3519160	it's kind of creepy all things considered anyhow even if you never play
3519160	3522160	earthbound I implore the listeners to set aside a few minutes to watch these
3522160	3529240	amazingly failed frightening experiences GIY GAS search for earth bounds Giygas
3529240	3537880	final battle and Lucas nightmare on YouTube greeny so there you have it dude
3537880	3544920	this thing is sick I like it but I like pyramid head better and that guy just
3544920	3549240	just doesn't rape things that's that's the difference no I don't know I mean
3549240	3553000	there's a guy guess in the next Smash Brothers game there you go there you go
3553000	3556960	that's what I'm talking about I want a horror all-stars game there you go we'll
3556960	3560360	put them in Smash Brothers and then they'll piss fans off even more because
3560360	3563520	yet another character from earthbound and they're not bring it over here ha
3563520	3568720	ha don't do it's like what they did with Kid Icarus all right anyhow that's gonna
3568720	3571800	do it for tonight's mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com if you want to
3571800	3574840	send us more emails it's like oh you want a Kid Icarus game did you well
3574840	3584920	once coming someday maybe so Activision you know since they are gonna be playing
3584920	3589480	on making a lot of Guitar Hero games need some more developers to help them
3589480	3596860	with that so they have acquired Budcat to do that and Budcat Creations the
3596860	3600920	student has been responsible for all Guitar Hero titles on PlayStation 2
3600920	3606760	since Guitar Hero 3 is currently in development of a new game in the Guitar
3606760	3616560	Hero franchise and one guess would be that it's Guitar Hero Matalka hmm and
3616560	3624440	says with Neversoft at the helm Budcat is working on PS2 and Vicarious Visions
3624440	3628960	will be responsible for the Wii and DS versions of whatever the next game will
3628960	3635800	be and Budcat also just worked on I guess Wii game that just came out on the
3635800	3639520	WiiWare service our house which was published by Majesco in the middle of
3639520	3648420	the street our house yes nevermind I don't know it's does is there really a
3648420	3652920	lot of development that needs to go into Guitar Hero Metallica I mean
3652920	3659320	apparently other than putting note charts you know together and maybe they
3659320	3662400	have to make it so uniquely different you know just like how Guitar Hero
3662400	3665920	Aerosmith was so different from Guitar Hero 3 yeah you know we do need to
3665920	3673400	create the exaggerated models of the Metallica band members well hey it's
3673400	3676600	interesting that Budcat is kind of being assimilated into the active Blizzard
3676600	3681680	Empire but what can you do more interesting stuff coming out for Guitar
3681680	3687280	Hero an official Gene Simmons brand axe guitar coming out for not just Guitar
3687280	3691640	Hero but Rock Band as well sweet it's a wireless guitar it looks like a
3691640	3695760	freaking axe not the deodorant or I'm talking about like like I'm gonna chop
3695760	3699960	you in half type type axe which actually looks pretty fucking sweet it's coming
3699960	3704520	out November 15th for 80 bucks or actually my money on that that date just
3704520	3708280	passed so it's already out now it's coming out for $80 it is compatible with
3708280	3713360	PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 versions of Guitar Hero and Rock Band the little
3713360	3718920	controller actually will work with both it uses a little dongle to get the
3718920	3724200	signal there apparently the actual guitar is like a three-quarter size
3724200	3728080	official replica of the official Gene Simmons axe guitar now unfortunately
3728080	3731360	this guitar will only work for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 if you
3731360	3737680	are an Xbox 360 owner you have to wait until April of 2009 if you're a Wii
3737680	3741580	owner January 31st is when you get your version of the guitar so I don't know
3741580	3746720	why Xbox 360 owners have to wait so much longer but there you go whatever they
3746720	3753000	got like what the Mad Catz bass guitar well as if there wasn't a million
3753000	3757040	different guitars out there already right but I have to admit yes one does
3757040	3760680	look pretty freaking sweet and I do need a new guitar but I play the games on the
3760680	3764840	Xbox 360 so I'll tell you what Rob the speaking of guitars this has nothing to
3764840	3771400	do with it okay I'm gonna throw that ferret in a fireplace yeah you say that
3771400	3776760	you think have you know the ferret is undefeatable you know what's funny is
3776760	3779600	that in Wii music you have all these obscure things right you have
3779600	3783480	cheerleaders triangles cowbell right all that stuff why don't we have ferret in
3783480	3787080	Wii music that might have made the game sell more copies think about it that
3787080	3791480	would be the OLR edition of Wii music think about it all right moving on but
3791480	3797680	now um samba de amigo see I say samba de amigo and everyone's like Navy SEALs
3797680	3804080	anyway um samba de amigo is going to be on mobile phones it will actually be
3804080	3809200	with a t-mobile and AT&T phones which pretty much spells out iPhone for me
3809200	3817640	since I think it's t-mobile t-mobile has the iPhone now too right or was it no
3817640	3821800	well I don't know in other countries they do but not here yeah um but also
3821800	3826880	will t-mobile has their sidekick too so basically those nice big screens but
3826880	3832080	samba de amigo is going to be coming up for t-mobile and AT&T phones um that's
3832080	3838400	gonna be pretty cool it's I mean basically just samba de amigo but
3838400	3845320	you're not going to really have it being all fun and maraca II you I think you
3845320	3851960	just shake the phone I was gonna say I mean how much can you really reciprocate
3851960	3855680	the experience of samba de amigo on a friggin cell phone that's what I don't
3855680	3861840	get you know it's a little silly to me well I might have to try it but that's
3861840	3867760	just to see exactly how it works so who knows there's I don't see any kind of a
3867760	3873760	date on it or anything yet but just keep looking if you care maybe I don't care
3873760	3881160	yikes you're right over that's you that was how little I cared all right well we
3881160	3885340	uh we asked our listeners tonight in a little segment we're now gonna call show

3946960	3949960	tyrant says could be fun for a few minutes on the iPhone I don't see it
3949960	3955040	being really worth it though music games generally suck on mobile dark Tetsuya
3955040	3959580	says even if I were to into mobile gaming probably not half the gameplay is
3959580	3963400	shaking the maracas you don't get that on a mobile deke man says after the Wii
3963400	3966840	versions crappy controls and no support on the console release I'm not expecting
3966840	3972040	anything Sega does to be good anymore misty olr says hell I'll probably check
3972040	3976920	it out of Verizon decides to make it work on my phone act-def says somebody

3981440	3986040	games I have a DS and a PSP maren marvel says probably not I think it would be
3986040	3989280	hard to emulate a game like that and make it as fun as the original in a
3989280	3994680	mobile phone version well unless was on the iPhone maybe still probably not
3994680	3999480	crows says you mobile games dim fancy cell phones were made for phone calls
3999480	4003680	nothing else for gaming they're probably even weaker than Game Boy Advance well
4003680	4007760	tempo says sure why not take a game beloved for its peripherals and put it
4007760	4014320	out on mobile phones what's next steel battalion and lastly geek boy says I
4014320	4017400	never had the chance to play the original because I was too young but I
4017400	4020520	wouldn't buy this in case I ever do get the chance to I don't want to ruin the
4020520	4024200	experience my cell phone is really crappy I want an iPhone if anybody wants

4042480	4047480	right all right let's move on gaming news do we gotta yes and because we're
4047480	4050880	almost to the classic game of the week dark soccer all right I know and we and
4050880	4053960	we have an interview tonight Aaron from seeing 360 I know it's a busy show
4053960	4059880	tonight we got to keep it moving oh yeah guitar here a world tour and rock band
4059880	4066080	are both getting brand new songs from the new killers album day and age and
4066080	4072080	it's originally thought to only be debuting on guitar world tour but of
4072080	4077360	course you know the MTV came out to say hey that's not true so there's going to
4077360	4082960	be a three song track pack available day and date with the new album and it will
4082960	4089560	be available for looks like a guitar here a world tour for 440 Microsoft
4089560	4094920	points or 549 on the PlayStation 3 also each song will be available individually
4094920	4101520	for 160 Microsoft points dollar 99 on ps3 and actually on the Nintendo Wii for
4101520	4109920	200 points a pop and then for rock bands be released I guess alongside with the
4109920	4115920	thing as well and no word on price or if they're gonna just be doing like a three
4115920	4124160	song pack that says looks like they're gonna feature yeah looks like it also
4124160	4128360	might be the same oh three different songs from there so whereas guitar here
4128360	4134840	world tour had human losing touch or human and losing touch rock band twos
4134840	4140920	got mr. right side alongside with smile like you mean it and I guess both of them
4140920	4146080	get day and age the killers are pretty cool I approve that's one of the songs I
4146080	4150640	really like to sing and sing star which by the way is sing star is kind of an
4150640	4154700	underrated karaoke game it really is does add to the party atmosphere to have
4154700	4157120	the original videos playing in the background I got to say all things
4157120	4159560	considered the sing store I know I'm like totally getting off track but I
4159560	4162920	don't care the sing store works pretty well that I actually did play that game
4162920	4165520	a little bit this week we actually downloaded some of the stuff from sing
4165520	4170520	store Paula Abdul opposites attract with the video and it's actually a duet and
4170520	4176760	you can choose to sing Paulus part or MC scat cat awesome just want to say that
4176760	4180000	even though it has nothing to do with the killers but it made me think of that
4180000	4184640	anyhow back to rock band and guitar hero some other download stuff coming out
4184640	4188080	very soon rock band is going to be getting the dead Kennedy's a three-pack

4198720	4203040	Burma also getting a three-pack Micah that's how I escaped my certain fate and
4203040	4208160	that's when I reached for my revolver like that song century media girls of

4212200	4216360	moment and then one more individual song coming out this week from crooked X a

4231840	4238960	and fire live from Woodstock that's pretty hot so check those out you can
4238960	4241960	either get something modern there in a rock band or something well I guess it's
4241960	4244960	not all right modern folks you know some of those other songs were like kind of
4244960	4249080	like 80s punk but pretty pretty good diverse selection between the two games
4249080	4254120	this week all right also to diversify your gaming week dark soccer is here to
4254120	4258960	pick a game from the archives and dub it as her classic video game of the week
4258960	4264960	because you kids need to respect your elder games and check out a old-school
4264960	4268080	game once in a while and even though dark soccer has kind of had some newer
4268080	4271320	choices as of late like last week was what Symphony of the night you can kind
4271320	4274960	of play that on the newer consoles tonight's pick going back to the very
4274960	4283040	very old-school right dark soccer that it is the game of the week is wizards
4283040	4289000	and warriors which is the game that I play the shit ton of me too I love the
4289000	4307880	Wizards and Warriors let's take a listen the map I like the music that it plays
4307880	4315840	when you go inside one of the little rooms in the trees right here
4315840	4319520	I tell us a little more about Wizards and Warriors Wizards and Warriors you
4319520	4326640	play as this dude named Kuros who was wearing full plate armor unlike the box
4326640	4332960	where he's dressed up as Conan the barbarian go fig hi I'm 80s Nintendo
4332960	4340440	artwork and was awesome bite my big toe damn inaccurate bastards making make a
4340440	4346280	man look like that anyway so you start off in the forest the forest is
4346280	4351560	wonderful and beautiful and scary and deadly full of spiders and creatures and
4351560	4357280	thingies but you can go inside trees and the trees have doors and they make
4357280	4360960	special noise every time you open the door and you get this cool music and
4360960	4364600	suddenly the trees have like special things that you can jump on and spiders
4364600	4371520	to kill so um you basically are going through the game and you can get
4371520	4376120	treasure chests that like if you find the ones with gem it gems in it it says
4376120	4381280	thou hast discovered gems or there was right there thou hast discovered dagger
4381280	4385160	of throwing just happened there I'm feeling so freaking guy playing here in
4385160	4390040	the background I remember that game this game was awesome but you can also get
4390040	4398840	potions and food as your healing items weapons and tools you have unlimited
4398840	4404160	continues and basically the only problem of dying is that your score gets reset
4404160	4413400	to zero so the main guy is he has a sword or an axe and a shield however in
4413400	4418960	the sequel you can actually choose iron sword you can actually choose to pick an
4418960	4426120	element and then go through the game like that I'm not really gonna talk too
4426120	4429160	much about the other versions because they were inferior in comparison to the
4429160	4435880	first one but it's like why couldn't they get him to look right on the
4435880	4439160	coverage I'm sorry for going back to that it's still bothering me dark Tetsuya
4439160	4442800	wants to point out don't forget the sequel iron sword that that box art
4442800	4448760	actually had Fabio on it yeah yeah awesome but that also made the game
4448760	4455680	slightly inferior so um but I mean really the game is very simple you just
4455680	4460840	go through all the different stages and you have to basically you have to keep
4460840	4466400	unlocking you rescuing these women throughout the level until you rescue
4466400	4471080	the princess I always like to think of them as wenches they were being held up
4471080	4480800	by ropes now the thing there is a trick with this game and the big trick with
4480800	4487720	this game is that if you go through the different levels and keep picking up
4487720	4492440	however many what was it I think it was the different keys you needed wasn't it
4492440	4498000	mm-hmm you can actually if you go back in into the second forest level which is
4498000	4501440	basically after you do the underground and come back up there's actually a way
4501440	4506600	to do a series of jumps to where you will jump over pretty much the screen
4506600	4512220	divider back into the first level of forest and you can play through the game
4512220	4516120	again and you'll actually beat the game halfway through the game because you'll
4516120	4519320	just have all the number of items you need and the princess will just be left
4519320	4524360	there going uh dude where are you so you actually don't have to fight the final
4524360	4530640	boss to beat the game you can just glitch the game out hardcore the bad guy
4530640	4538440	mal kill was also in an episode of captain and the game master freaking
4538440	4545600	stupid show it was in the nightmare on mother brain Street nice and the world
4545600	4550480	it in the game it was called the kingdom of Elrond in the show it was called
4550480	4553920	Excalibur for some reason can I just say something completely random I'm watching
4553920	4558200	the video of this guy playing wizards and warriors and the little beehives of
4558200	4566720	the bees come out of look like poop yes they do I call them shit bees nice also
4566720	4574080	um kuros the main guy and he was in a show called the power team and they made
4574080	4578640	him look like a man but now this is one cool thing and I wasn't quite aware of
4578640	4582840	this but what the wizards and warriors story was turned into a book called
4582840	4588280	worlds of power different series of novels for for young children and it was
4588280	4594800	about a boy named Matthew who was trying to use his imagination creatively and
4594800	4599240	instead brings his father's night figure to life and has to go help fight the
4599240	4607640	battle but that's just the story so anyway I love this game I hate every
4607640	4613800	other version after it so which is a warriors classic game of the week check
4613800	4623400	it out if you happen to own in well done thou hast rescued what was her name
4623400	4627800	Lucinda the distress damsel 500 points and of conveniently she's wearing a
4627800	4633160	bikini who knew maybe she's a harem girl wizards and warriors classic game of the
4633160	4635820	week we're gonna use this opportunity to take a quick break here on orange

4684980	4689400	same so we play some music from assorted video games and one of the gay music we
4689400	4692300	were we was playing there during the break was Super Mario would I just say
4692300	4697280	we was playing Super Mario Brothers out there playing we was playing something
4697280	4700840	else no we were playing the theme music from Super Mario Brothers 2 and I can
4700840	4703960	play a clip of it playing clips of songs is okay on podcast I just can't play the
4703960	4707240	whole thing well you know the old-school song
4707240	4711720	and dark soccer comes in here and starts singing Dookie over all the lyrics
4711720	4715600	dookie dookie dookie dookie dookie dookie so I started singing along too and
4715600	4720160	then I went dookie dookie dookie dookie dookie poop and then we just started busting up
4720160	4725120	because we're like five years old all right anyway look let's get back to and
4725120	4731960	Frisbee says dookie dookie panic that's a Mario Brothers 2 joke I thought that was a
4731960	4737060	funny joke all right anyhow let's move on we're gonna get back into some gaming
4737060	4740000	news here during this part B you guys are gonna call us a little later on
4740000	4744000	with your phone calls and interview Aaron Toplitsky is gonna be joining us
4744000	4749640	snake 360 and you can see the teasers at snake 360 calm it's like the old-school
4749640	4754960	snake from the cell phones but like like camera angles and color and multiplayer
4754960	4760800	and goals and modes galore it's it's nuts we'll talk all about it with Aaron
4760800	4764840	here very soon but first some more gaming news Loki yes the recently
4764840	4772000	released banjo-kazooie game nuts and bolts has a little bit of a problem if
4772000	4775960	you have an older TV or an older TV that also happens to be very small
4775960	4782700	apparently the in-game text is too small to see on some standard definition
4782700	4787600	television sets and originally rare had said that they weren't gonna fix the
4787600	4792480	problem that it would be too expensive in terms of time resources and money to
4792480	4796880	alter the company has now gone back on that word and said that they will have a
4796880	4801680	fix within the next 30 days which just shows goes to show you the internet
4801680	4805800	bitches enough it will get its way well it can't be that hard I mean after all
4805800	4812080	dead rising have the same problem and the same fix so come on guys it's just
4812080	4818440	like what editing a font seriously I imagine though from the developer
4818440	4823200	perspective getting these patches out there is got to be a pain in the ass but
4823200	4830640	within to be fair though all games that are published on the 360 are supposed to
4830640	4835060	go through a process where they actually test them on a standard definition 14
4835060	4841160	inch TV and you know the text has to be you know readable on that and it has to
4841160	4846640	play well look right and all that sort of stuff so the steps are in place to
4846640	4851760	make sure it goes out right they just ignored those steps most game testers
4851760	4858160	I've talked to as well get it's not like these companies buy their game testers
4858160	4862760	big expensive fancy screens to test the games on you know most of these guys
4862760	4866320	have little monitors and things I'm surprised this stuff doesn't come out in
4866320	4869400	testing maybe because they sit so close to the monitor when they're testing the
4869400	4872860	game they don't really have living rooms to sit and play the games and I have no
4872860	4876400	idea how this thing's how these this gets missed or approved you know what I
4876400	4882200	mean well seeing that in my memory it's only been two games really so far that
4882200	4887560	have had this issue I think that the precautions and the steps are in place
4887560	4892240	to make sure this doesn't happen I think that maybe they were trying to rush the
4892240	4896860	game out to the market and didn't quite have time to go back and fix said
4896860	4902280	problem with game until after the fact and they first they said oh let's see if
4902280	4906880	no one notices and you know sure enough people notice and they're I see if
4906880	4910080	they're fine with us not fixing it and sure enough people weren't so now they
4910080	4913680	have to do it all right well speaking of banjo-kazooie
4913680	4919080	Loki has been able to hook us up with this right here I'm holding in my hot
4919080	4922320	little hand on Justin TV if you guys can see that there if you're on the radio
4922320	4927540	you you unfortunately cannot see it but what this is this is a code for you to

4934800	4939360	gonna be giving that away next week on the show a popular game is coming back

4965680	4970120	I promise the next contest we do will be open to all that was satisfying Rob
4970120	4973680	what hunting the channel getting up and getting away that I know there you have
4973680	4977040	it all right so stay tuned for that meantime we're gonna move on to the
4977040	4981000	PlayStation 3 and talking about little big planet man what a mess little big
4981000	4984880	planet has suddenly become you know I talked about this game last week this
4984880	4989040	game is awesome I still love this game but it sounds like moderation is really
4989040	4994880	starting to get a little crazy there Sony apparently has laid out some rules
4994880	4998600	this week ensure the content you share with other users is suitable for all
4998600	5001960	ages and everybody has access to your level if you publish it please respect
5001960	5004720	other people's intellectual property rights for example don't use images
5004720	5007760	brands or logos that you're not entitled to use and if you come across any
5007760	5010740	content that you feel the need to report then please do it responsibly hoax
5010740	5014920	reports will be considered inappropriate behavior well I don't know if this has
5014920	5017940	made anything better for them to come out and clarify because apparently some
5017940	5021680	really popular levels on little big planet have been hit including one
5021680	5026440	called as your palace which I haven't played myself but it's awesome very very
5026440	5030200	popular level one of the favorite it got hit for moderation this week if you can
5030200	5035480	believe it and they can't figure out why this game got hit for moderation was it
5035480	5038920	the blood splatters they had in the level that apparently were I don't know
5038920	5043840	there's and it gets worse than that actually it's not just that one many of
5043840	5047360	the top levels have been hit with moderation including the world of color
5047360	5050960	which is another one which there is nothing copyright in world of color I
5050960	5053960	don't get that as weird well the level creator of Azure
5053960	5058240	Palace is pissed he made a comment I invested a huge amount of time making
5058240	5061200	the Azure Palace to not only be original but to shift the gameplay of this
5061200	5064640	wonderful game you guys made besides similarities to underwater stages in
5064640	5068240	general there's nothing directly taken from any game movie etc if there so
5068240	5072320	happen to be one the terms of moderation are by far extremely irrational the user
5072320	5075560	is given no chance to change certain aspects of his creation to conform to
5075560	5079640	said rules about we're not even given a freaking reason as to why it happened so
5079640	5084880	needless to say whoever is pulling these levels Sony media molecule whoever I
5084880	5088000	imagine Sony whoever is pulling these levels is starting to bite the hand that
5088000	5090120	feeds them a little bit because if you piss off all the people that are
5090120	5094320	creating the great content for your game there's not gonna be much left with
5094320	5100920	those you know win nine trophies and 32nd levels which get old fast it's
5100920	5105560	really sad though because lots of levels are getting moderated some you know
5105560	5109360	maybe they're kind of borderline you know there's like that Tetris level that
5109360	5114000	was sort of like Tetris but not quite that got moderated there's that level
5114000	5117800	was a lot of fun there is a bunch of other ones but there's like seriously a
5117800	5122640	ton of threads on little big workshop the official website you know for little
5122640	5130760	big planet and stuff and you know tons of stuff me there's a 22 page for you
5130760	5135200	know post on there that's just going you know and some of the things like some of
5135200	5141000	the comments there's a mini game actually in little big planet in the
5141000	5146280	frozen tundra level or a world called spline rider where you get on a thin
5146280	5150920	sled and slide around on a track hmm seems kind of familiar to a popular
5150920	5155920	online game called line rider so it's okay for a medium article to go ahead
5155920	5160120	and rip off of their games but it's not okay for other people to do that and
5160120	5164280	they actually have it's okay for them to have a strip club in the game but heaven
5164280	5167080	forbid you see a blood splatter you know those blood splatters those are actually
5167080	5172240	taken from the game they're in one of the Asian levels in there where there's
5172240	5175960	blood splatters underneath these blades that are there so it's stuff that's in
5175960	5182560	the game I it's just retarded game guru says this moderation will kill little
5182560	5186440	big planet in our chat room and I kind of tend to agree I mean if this is what
5186440	5189640	they're gonna do I mean again they're biting the hand that feeds them in a
5189640	5193480	game that thrives on community creation which is the best part of the game if
5193480	5197760	you keep pissing off your a-plus creators what's gonna be left there
5197760	5200520	people get this and they're thinking of they're selling their copies of the
5200520	5203120	games or they're just doing whatever things no I think it's kind of funny
5203120	5206640	remember how there's that God of War level that got moderated and kicked off
5206640	5212840	there yet there's God of War skins and level stickers that you can use to make
5212840	5216440	a God of War level that doesn't make any sense either and there's a bunch of
5216440	5221320	other stuff I mean just go through some of the threads on this forum just
5221320	5224920	absolutely random levels like someone made the rent just a race car level it's
5224920	5232120	a skill racer and it got taken off just like you know random stuff my there are
5232120	5236600	a few things I recommend if you're planning on uploading level that you can
5236600	5240640	bypass a lot of stuff or maybe make it a little bit easier on yourself one make a
5240640	5244080	copy of the level first before you upload it and upload the copy because if
5244080	5247840	your copy gets moderated then you can still make a copy of the original level
5247840	5252640	again and re upload it if you need to also if you want one good thing if you
5252640	5255680	think someone's gonna kick your level offline make it so that they can
5255680	5258720	download a copy of your level as well you can have that option on there so
5258720	5262360	someone can actually save it you know even put in your comments to make sure
5262360	5265120	you save the level when you're done you can actually save it to your moon and
5265120	5268280	then it doesn't matter if it gets moderated and if anyone from Sony or
5268280	5271040	Media Molecule happens to listen to this show because we do have some industry
5271040	5274040	people listen to this show but kind of keep quiet and they don't really let us
5274040	5277280	know they're listening if anybody from the either those companies happens to
5277280	5280520	listen to the show it is imperative you guys comment on the situation like this
5280520	5284360	week I mean you can't let this keep going on much longer it is starting to
5284360	5288000	snowball out of control it is imperative you get your legal department on the
5288000	5291720	ball and say something quick yes and the other thing too is because people are
5291720	5295400	there aren't saying anything people are thinking the worst oh is are they gonna
5295400	5298240	steal my levels and use them in a download pack or something they're
5298240	5303240	gonna charge money for oh why are they doing this you know it's just it's
5303240	5307480	ridiculous and the thing that's really ridiculous about it is say you work new
5307480	5310920	20 hours on level and upload it and stuff like that and they moderate for
5310920	5315520	some retarded reason you can't re upload it again so you can't really make a copy
5315520	5319800	of it or you know do whatever with it and I seem to remember this comparison
5319800	5323960	being made in the past but gs68 makes it again tonight see blast works has levels
5323960	5328640	with copyrighted imagery yet their staff doesn't mind that shit and nobody sued
5328640	5333560	blast works yet yeah very interesting tigerclaw says this could probably
5333560	5337080	spark a global boycott of the game if they don't fix it I don't know so much
5337080	5339800	about that because I think a lot of people that work at the games have
5339800	5343680	already all been sold a lot of times you know you know what I mean most people
5343680	5346680	that were really eager about the game already bought it yyr kind of follows up
5346680	5349800	with that global boycott will never happen it's as likely to happen as an
5349800	5354080	internet petition meaning something what they need to do is somehow create a
5354080	5358200	patch that allows you to swap saves and have like some third-party way to you
5358200	5361760	know swap levels or something like that well look I know if I spent 20 hours
5361760	5365800	making a level and it got moderated with no explanation I'd be pretty pissed off
5365800	5370280	so to those LBP players that have made these levels and had them rip down with
5370280	5375240	no explanation we dedicate a segment of ours tonight to you the f-use of the
5375240	5377360	week
5387760	5394800	dark soccer I want you to start us off tonight a few to apathetic voters as in
5394800	5403560	people who don't vote I mean really there's people who complain about an
5403560	5409440	issue and don't vote on it because if you if it doesn't mean enough to you to
5409440	5414120	go out and make your voice heard you know at least by giving your vote to the
5414120	5419120	issue then you have no right to complain but like if somebody just abstains from
5419120	5422680	voting for a school board member because I don't know anything about I'm talking
5422680	5427640	about any issues yeah I'm just saying though if it if it's something that's
5427640	5432320	really not going to affect everything from day to day that's one thing but if
5432320	5439760	it's something like Oh example a civil rights issue hmm Alameda County oh I'm
5439760	5448320	sorry only 22% of them voted that's right lazy asses but uh just make sure
5448320	5451640	if it means something to you that instead of just bitching about it you do
5451640	5458480	something about it okay if you to my place of employment for still not giving
5458480	5464560	me a raise and for potentially making my job even harder my co-worker is quitting
5464560	5470800	here within the next couple weeks and unfortunately they're gonna probably
5470800	5475800	hire someone else to fill a spot and I'm gonna get probably some of his bigger
5475800	5479680	accounts and they're planning on giving me yet another really big account and
5479680	5486040	it's just more work for me to do with no sort of I don't compensation for it and
5486040	5491440	it kind of sucks but their mentality is you don't like it leave and
5491440	5496200	unfortunately I've been there for almost ten years and I would rather them get
5496200	5503240	over themselves give me a raise and waste ten years of my life I really just
5503240	5506720	want to give an F you tonight to Noah's bagels and their bagel dogs because
5506720	5510680	they're so delicious and I can't stop eating them especially now that you know
5510680	5513080	after the gall bladders come out my health is starting to get back to normal
5513080	5517320	thank God a few to those things for being so damn yummy and I know they're
5517320	5524160	not good for you sorry that my F you is a little more silly compared to some of
5524160	5528760	the others tonight but sometimes it's the little things all right anyhow let's
5528760	5536280	get back into some gaming news dark Sakura and the magic number is five what
5536280	5539840	magic number I'm just kidding I thought three was a magic number that's what
5539840	5545280	they told me on schoolhouse rock 42 oh I see well who's been looking forward to
5545280	5551000	Loco Roco to I never really got into Loco Roco one but I check it out I would
5551000	5561320	check it out Loco Roco is crack at any rate yes ma'am on the online portal for
5561320	5567560	the Loco Roco to site there is actually a flash minigame that you can play it's
5567560	5574400	over on spill games website and it will be there until the 21st of November so
5574400	5579320	try it while you can and you know download it while you can I'm sorry did
5579320	5586240	I say that out loud but I will be linking the the site in the chat room
5586240	5595400	however to go ahead and say this on the podcast it is at games.co.uk slash game
5595400	5605760	slash loco Roco to dot HTML so give it a try is cute all righty it's the cuteness
5605760	5611040	there's some people are calling it in chat Loki Roco it's not Loki Roco
5611040	5615920	that's a cute name Loki Roco that's all start calling him on this program just
5615920	5620800	kidding Loki Roco this rumors been around before but now it's coming into
5620800	5628520	yet another venue I guess electronic gaming monthly their usual
5628520	5634280	quarter-man segment of different rumors and speculations well he now has a
5634280	5640020	rumor saying that little big planet will be coming to the PSP in 2009 I mean it
5640020	5643760	makes sense that they'll do that and I think with actually the controls it
5643760	5648240	could work you could easily do that on there I don't know how it look because
5648240	5654960	the PSP obviously is not as powerful as I don't know the PlayStation 3 but it's
5654960	5660360	not being developed by media molecule right no it seems that they are actually
5660360	5666520	at the oh yeah that's right it won't have them it instead it's a Sony studio
5666520	5671600	Liverpool wipeout pulse we asked media molecule for comment and what they said
5671600	5674480	is that they were gonna moderate this game for being too similar to their own
5674480	5687400	it's kind of a bummer they said I am Spartacus shut up all right no I it's no
5687400	5690080	surprise though that they're gonna hoard this franchise out into the ground that
5690080	5693160	there's a PSP version coming out it might actually be pretty cool especially
5693160	5697160	if wait for this especially if the levels you get you know assuming this
5697160	5700520	whole moderation thing gets figured out if you could get the levels in your ps3
5700520	5705120	and transfer them to your PSP that might be pretty awesome actually don't you
5705120	5710960	think yeah I don't know I don't know if it'd look right oh you can't because the
5710960	5714280	proportions and everything I can't imagine that they'd be able to do the
5714280	5719880	same kind of quality on the PSP it's got to be scaled down quite a bit all right
5719880	5722160	well we'll see I don't know about you guys it sounds pretty interesting to me
5722160	5726000	well damn the news will not just stop coming in about burnout paradise what
5726000	5728120	was it was just last week we were talking about the awesome old-school
5728120	5734240	cars are gonna be in the game and now apparently toy cars are coming to burn
5734240	5739440	out paradise you know criterion they're really awesome about this they're
5739440	5744000	showing you how to keep the game alive it's great well now apparently they are
5744000	5748640	going to be introducing tiny little collectible cars no idea if the cars
5748640	5752280	themselves will be tiny in the game but they all look like little Hot Wheels and
5752280	5755920	they're pretty awesome apparently there's nine cars in all Carson GT
5755920	5761680	concept p12 Krieger racing wtr hunter takedown 4x4 and hunter Manhattan so on
5761680	5766920	and so on apparently they're all gonna come out next year and that's awesome
5766920	5770280	criterion just keeps supporting this game I love the monster truck that's
5770280	5773400	gonna be awesome this little purple one with flames on it you're putting Hot
5773400	5777320	Wheels in the game good for them that would be funny if you could actually
5777320	5781640	drive the little cars around and they act like big cars you can smash through
5781640	5787040	things and just pow-pow power wheels pow-pow all right forget it that would
5787040	5790200	be some preschool or driving a car around would be pretty awesome don't
5790200	5793640	you think I don't know I'm sure it's just a matter of time but don't expect
5793640	5796440	to hear anything on a new burnout game anytime soon because they're still
5796440	5801760	supporting the one that's out there but that's not a bad thing not a bad thing
5801760	5809300	well we knew it was bound to happen since World of Warcraft whatever the
5809300	5815420	fuck Lich King came out that'll be wrath of the Lich King yes whatever we
5815420	5823760	have a level 80 it's a 21 year old and leads a raiding guild and the character
5823760	5835460	is called Nim NYMH 27 hours worth of leveling and being kept alive by a
5835460	5845600	healer so Nim got all the experience and made it to 80 and apparently the one
5845600	5852880	right after was someone called Daris who was suspended by Blizzard at level 79
5852880	5860280	and bumped back to level 70 after using an exploit oh snap I want to know what
5860280	5867360	this I want to know what the exploit was interesting grinding in a crypt in the
5867360	5873600	Grizzly Hills area oh wait a second that is grinding is not a exploit that he
5873600	5879880	didn't get banned no Daris got got bled got bled banned or rolled back or
5879880	5884840	whatever you want to call it I wonder what that was yeah Walmart yeah he got
5884840	5889120	moderated he got Walmarted they were already now what makes it so notable is
5889120	5893880	that you know it's supposed to take you like a month to get to 80 you know the
5893880	5898600	game came out what Wednesday night I'm level 73 and I've been playing pretty
5898600	5903320	hardcore most people in my guild are only like 71 maybe 72 well apparently
5903320	5909800	this place that he was grinding at has a really high respawn rate and monsters
5909800	5915920	are neutral oh interesting yeah it's a crypt in the Grizzly Hills area there
5915920	5919640	apparently is there's spam at everybody and crash the server there's a lot of
5919640	5924080	level level one boars there and you know and you just kept killing them solid
5924080	5929900	Goomba comments and says mom bathroom which must have been exactly what
5929900	5933440	happened here with this guy no you know it despite all the fun being made of
5933440	5938080	this guy the thing that he did that the rest of the people aren't doing he went
5938080	5941920	they obviously found this area in the beta figured it would be a good area to
5941920	5945840	go to when the game hit they went straight to this area this was their
5945840	5950160	sole intention to gain XP as fast as possible and with a warlock of a certain
5950160	5953720	spec it's pretty easy to do if you have a dedicated healer and did nothing but
5953720	5958520	level this guy didn't quest or get any of the story out of it he did nothing
5958520	5964180	but grind his way to 80 so you know make fun of them all you want but he just you
5964180	5968000	know they had the goal in mind perseverance honestly a 27-hour gaming
5968000	5971560	session marathon gaming session is not the worst we've ever heard of it might
5971560	5976800	be easy to make fun of Wow and all that stuff but you know what it's it's really
5976800	5980120	I've heard of worse you know we talked about some of these record-breaking
5980120	5983360	things what asteroids some guy played it for what 72 hours straight back in the
5983360	5986580	80s I was reading something about asteroids this week I don't remember why
5986580	5989160	but was reading about that oh yeah because I think that I think we just
5989160	5993680	passed the anniversary of that record being set I think I was reading some
5993680	5998840	story on that so hopefully Nim will go back and discover the secret of the
5998840	6001720	awesome quests that are in wrath of the Lich King now that he's level 80 and can
6001720	6005520	blow through them all real quick anyhow um you know I've been playing wrath of
6005520	6008800	Lich King quite a lot this week but something that might actually be able to
6008800	6013240	divert my attention away from Warcraft this next week is the release of the new
6013240	6017460	Xbox experience one thing we've been talking about a lot on this show is the
6017460	6021560	addition of community games to the Xbox dashboard one of the games that is going
6021560	6028600	to be coming out is called snake 360 and it has an interesting tie-in to music
6028600	6031960	based video games which we've been talking about a lot on this show you
6031960	6035200	know previously in our history and anything anyway to join us on the show
6035200	6040200	tonight to talk about snake 360 is its creator Aaron Teplitsky we're gonna get
6040200	6043720	on the phones and I get a hold of Aaron and talk to him a little about a little
6043720	6049540	bit about his new game snake 360 well hey Aaron are you there yeah I'm right
6049540	6052720	here all right well welcome to the show thanks so much for taking the time to be
6052720	6056800	on orange lounge radio this evening how you doing this Sunday night I'm doing
6056800	6060280	great thank you very much for having me on here I really appreciate it awesome
6060280	6064000	not a problem hey we're all about you know the independent games as well as
6064000	6068680	the big boys so tell us your game is snake 360 coming to the new Xbox 360
6068680	6072400	experience tell us a little bit about snake 360 what is this game all about
6072400	6076560	well basically what it is it's similar to you know snake games that you've
6076560	6080880	probably seen before on cell phones old computers and whatnot but what it is is
6080880	6085640	a complete reimagining graphically you know it's got 3d graphics it runs nice
6085640	6093120	and smooth and you know it has a very clean look it's a little boxy but you
6093120	6100920	know that's that's the way snake is so basically you know it's not you're not
6100920	6104160	gonna get a huge graphical masterpiece you know if you're looking for that then
6104160	6108320	you'll play Gears 2 but what it lacks in graphics it definitely makes up for in
6108320	6113040	the gameplay department it's got you know classic gameplay and a whole wide
6113040	6116520	range of levels they start you know ridiculous easy you got your four walls
6116520	6121360	and that's it and then it goes up to insanely difficult if you like retro
6121360	6125200	games arcade games just challenging games in general you're gonna get a lot
6125200	6129800	of mileage out of snake 360 especially seeing as how it's got internet-based
6129800	6132960	leaderboards you know I think you're selling yourself a little bit short on
6132960	6135840	the graphical ability of the game because you know sure we all know the
6135840	6139580	game snake on cell phones it's you know a blocky game where you kind of go but I
6139580	6144020	noticed in watching the trailer on your website snake 360.com you you kind of do
6144020	6148520	all these little neat camera rotation tricks and and you know for what is
6148520	6153620	essentially a basic almost Atari 2600 style game you've really kind of thrown
6153620	6158600	all these camera and flashy effects to really kind of bring it next-gen well
6158600	6163940	you know I what I try and do is I throw in the instant replays and the camera
6163940	6167720	effects and the different angles and part of it is functionality you know
6167720	6171480	related because you know sometimes you want a view of the whole level sometimes
6171480	6176200	you want a view of you know just used you can line up better get a view of
6176200	6180060	your surroundings maybe want to zoom in maybe you want to zoom out so party just
6180060	6183480	functionality related but also you know we've come to expect a lot of these
6183480	6187960	things in games if you're involved in you just you know cut the other guy off
6187960	6191320	and surprised the heck out of them and everybody in the room is screaming and
6191320	6195120	yelling you're going to watch that over and over and over again to rub it in his
6195120	6199120	So, you know, you've got the instant replay for that reason.
6199120	6204120	Awesome. Sounds great. Well, now, I don't want to talk just about graphics.
6204120	6209120	Let's talk about music for a minute, because even though this game has nothing to do with arrow stomping or beat matching,
6209120	6214120	I hear there's a connection in here for fans of dance music games, which we have a lot of at Orange Lounge.
6214120	6215120	What's the connection?
6215120	6225120	Well, actually, it turns out I was looking for music, and I'm no musician, so I went to Kyle Ward and John Mendenhall
6225120	6227120	and their record label, SCI Recordings.
6227120	6232120	Their website right now is scirecordings.com, and we struck a little bit of a deal.
6232120	6238120	And as it turns out, players of the In the Groove series of games and also the more recent Pump Pro
6238120	6241120	are going to find that they're familiar with a lot of the music in the game.
6241120	6248120	And we fleshed it out with some music that they won't be familiar with, and in total, there are nine of their songs in the game.
6248120	6252120	And I think that players are going to really enjoy the soundtrack.
6252120	6259120	It's, you know, pumping, you know, get your blood moving, and maybe cause you not to crash into a wall. I don't know.
6259120	6263120	All right. All right, cool. Yeah, you know, you can hear a lot of that in the trailer.
6263120	6267120	You can kind of hear some of the music, and it does kind of add a certain intensity to the game,
6267120	6272120	especially, I'm sure, for, you know, the more intense modes like Battle Mode and things where you're competing against, you know, other people.
6272120	6278120	Yeah, well, I'm really fond of the soundtrack, and I've been listening to it for months straight working on the game,
6278120	6283120	and I'm not sick of it yet. So I guess that probably says that it might actually be working for the game.
6283120	6289120	So you mentioned you've been working on the game for months. How long did things take from idea to where we are,
6289120	6291120	the game's launching November 19th?
6291120	6298120	Well, I'll be quite honest with you. Throughout 2007, I was thinking about this game constantly.
6298120	6304120	Like, I'm working this little IT job for a nonprofit, which is completely not the field that I want to be working in.
6304120	6310120	And just driving from place to place, I'd be thinking about it. I'd be thinking, well, this is how I want this to work,
6310120	6316120	and this is how, you know, I imagine this. And towards the end of the year, you know, with XNA out,
6316120	6322120	I just said, well, why don't I take a stab at this? And my original intent was to target Xbox Live Arcade,
6322120	6327120	and I actually submitted to them, and it took them a long time to get back to me.
6327120	6332120	I don't know what happened with that, but in the time between the time I submitted to them
6332120	6337120	and the time they gave me the final answer, they announced community games.
6337120	6342120	So I'm thinking, yeah, hey, that's not a bad idea. And then finally they came back and they said,
6342120	6349120	well, we have limited space for casual action games on Xbox Live Arcade, so we feel it's not a good fit at this time.
6349120	6354120	So I'm like, well, you know, community games. And that was back in March.
6354120	6358120	So starting in March, I started working on it, you know, more frequently.
6358120	6366120	I actually started, completely started last December. That's when I just, you know, started from scratch with XNA
6366120	6371120	and, you know, got a snake moving on the screen and whatnot. And then I really took it into high gear in August.
6371120	6378120	So I really started about a year ago, but I'd say, you know, solid work is probably about seven months
6378120	6384120	of all my spare time went into this game. I know that was a long convoluted answer, but yeah.
6384120	6389120	No, that's all right. That's very interesting to kind of hear that you actually had submitted originally
6389120	6393120	an Xbox Live Arcade game, but yet they turned it down. And when you look at some of the stuff
6393120	6396120	that's on Xbox Live Marketplace that they went through.
6396120	6400120	Well, you know, it's interesting you say that because I'm not the only one who's been turned down.
6400120	6404120	Have you heard of the Japanese shoot-em-up developer, Cave?
6404120	6407120	I think I have, yes.
6407120	6413120	I was absolutely floored when I found out that they submitted two of their games to Live Arcade
6413120	6417120	and they were turned down because I absolutely adore their games.
6417120	6421120	I have a Japanese PS2 that I, you know, basically play shoot-em-ups on.
6421120	6427120	And I'm planning on getting a Japanese 360 so I can play the upcoming Cave shooters
6427120	6431120	if they're not localized here. And I was absolutely floored.
6431120	6436120	But on the other hand, I felt, well, you know what, if they're being rejected, then maybe I don't feel so bad.
6436120	6441120	At least you're in good company. All right, well, talking about the development cycle of the game,
6441120	6446120	you know, a lot of folks kind of, you know, are critical of the Xbox 360 control scheme.
6446120	6451120	But you kind of found an interesting way around it for a game that requires kind of precision
6451120	6453120	in turning like Snake does, right?
6453120	6458120	Yeah, well, everybody knows that the 360's D-Pad leaves a lot to be desired.
6458120	6463120	One of the first things I did when I started playing XBLA games was I went and I bought an arcade stick
6463120	6470120	because even for Pac-Man, you know, it just gums up the works. I can't play Pac-Man with that D-Pad.
6470120	6475120	So at first, you know, I was thinking, well, you know, we can use the analog sticks and you've got those options.
6475120	6480120	But really the best solution, and I say so in the trailer, not in the trailer,
6480120	6486120	I say so in the other video I put up, I say so in the documentation and I say so within the game itself.
6486120	6489120	The best solution is to use the A, B, X, and Y face buttons.
6489120	6493120	A is down, Y is up, and then you've got X and B for the sides.
6493120	6496120	And that is absolutely the best way to control this game.
6496120	6501120	All right. That sounds like a very creative work around. So that's probably what I'll use.
6501120	6503120	You know, we weren't using those buttons for anything else.
6503120	6507120	I basically, I was thinking, well, you know, we could do turbo boosts, we could do this and that.
6507120	6511120	But in the end, I decided for this version, because I might expand it later,
6511120	6517120	especially considering that the version I'm releasing is not the version I originally anticipated.
6517120	6519120	I didn't quite get everything that I wanted in there.
6519120	6524120	But for this version, I decided let's keep the accessibility high.
6524120	6529120	Let's keep the gameplay simple so that, you know, you look at it, you know exactly how it works.
6529120	6531120	You can jump right in.
6531120	6534120	The challenge of this game is not in new gameplay elements,
6534120	6538120	but it's in the challenging level designs and all the other things you can do with it.
6538120	6541120	Well, you know, you say you didn't get to put everything you wanted to in there,
6541120	6543120	but it sure sounds like you put an awful lot in there.
6543120	6547120	In fact, some things I haven't really heard of going on with other community games,
6547120	6550120	like your website, www.snake360.com,
6550120	6554120	it has this internet ranking on it with like, what, 50 different leaderboards or something like that?
6554120	6558120	Now, community games, they're not going to have achievements. We all know that.
6558120	6563120	But this kind of seems like it's like a creative, different work around to still encourage competition.
6563120	6565120	How does this internet ranking thing work?
6565120	6570120	Well, it works extremely similarly to the way that any internet ranking board worked
6570120	6574120	before we had online leaderboards that were integrated into the game itself.
6574120	6578120	Anybody who played Ikaruga on GameCube and participated in the rankings there,
6578120	6584120	they're also ranking from a lot of arcade games where they basically just put codes on the screen.
6584120	6588120	And you go to their website, you put in the code, yeah, you put in the code, and boom,
6588120	6590120	there you are on the internet rankings.
6590120	6594120	And we'll have you keep track of your email address so that if you submit the same score twice,
6594120	6602120	or if you submit two scores for one course, it'll automatically overwrite your lower score with your higher one.
6602120	6607120	And the reason there are over 50 leaderboards is because there's going to be a leaderboard for every course,
6607120	6611120	every difficulty, every round you can play in survival mode.
6611120	6615120	Like, you can go crazy competing for high scores in this game.
6615120	6616120	Wow.
6616120	6620120	And if you're still finishing up the internet ranking, it should hopefully be ready by the end of next week.
6620120	6624120	All right. Now, you mentioned there's all these different types of internet ranking boards.
6624120	6628120	That's because you have all these different types of modes and handicaps in the game,
6628120	6632120	and it sounds like you've made this very accessible for children as well as, you know,
6632120	6636120	hardcore people that really get into these types of arcade games.
6636120	6639120	Tell us about some of your favorite modes that you have in the game.
6639120	6644120	Oh, I mean, the main game mode basically throws you into a course consisting of eight levels.
6644120	6649120	And actually, it may or may not consist of eight levels depending on whether you lose any lives along the way,
6649120	6650120	and I'll leave it at that.
6650120	6657120	But if you can complete all the levels on the course, you'll get a code for internet ranking.
6657120	6660120	And the courses are played on several different difficulty levels.
6660120	6664120	What you'll get is, you know, basically this kind of the same concept.
6664120	6668120	Like, for example, on Easy, maybe you'll get something that kind of looks like a tree.
6668120	6669120	On Normal, you'll get a tree.
6669120	6672120	On Difficult, you'll get a tree with more branches, that kind of thing.
6672120	6676120	So they'll take the same concept, and they'll just keep making it more and more difficult
6676120	6678120	as you go up in level.
6678120	6681120	And, you know, a lot of the level themes are very interesting,
6681120	6685120	and part of the fun of the game is to see, oh, well, now I'm playing on a new level.
6685120	6687120	I wonder what this level's going to look like.
6687120	6691120	And the Survival mode, well, that's just, you know, classic.
6691120	6693120	A lot of old Snake games just played like that.
6693120	6698120	You get one life, and you just last as long as you can, and you grow to ridiculous lengths.
6698120	6704120	And this version throws in a time limit so that you can't just go in a circle and survive forever,
6704120	6707120	and you get a time bonus when you pick up a target.
6707120	6711120	But you're just going to have to be really careful not to block yourself off from more targets
6711120	6713120	or, you know, trap yourself.
6713120	6720120	You know, it's very interesting, and one of the fake achievements, I'm going to call them goals,
6720120	6724120	in the game is to last in there for four minutes, and it's harder than it sounds.
6724120	6726120	All right. What about some of the things you've put?
6726120	6730120	Now, this is something for a player who's really, really good at the game,
6730120	6734120	but what about somebody who's not so great at Snake, 360?
6734120	6737120	There's kind of modes you put in for them, too, right?
6737120	6744120	Yeah, well, you know what? My mother's even played this game using a couple of handicaps that I've put in.
6744120	6751120	There's slower speeds. You can turn the Snake speed down to slow or even slowest, which is half the normal speed.
6751120	6757120	It plays pretty slowly. If you've got good reflexes, you'll want to stick with the normal or the faster speeds,
6757120	6762120	but there's a slow speed for them, and there's also visual guides that you can turn on
6762120	6766120	in the form of lines that extend from the targets in all four directions.
6766120	6769120	You can line up more easily with those.
6769120	6773120	And if you play with those on, then you won't be eligible for the Internet ranking,
6773120	6778120	but something that will get a lot more people into the game, making it easier, that sort of thing.
6778120	6781120	And there's also something exciting I threw in called Kid Mode.
6781120	6786120	And with this, anybody can play. It's like bumper bowling for Snake.
6786120	6790120	Basically, you're rushing into a wall, boom, nothing happens.
6790120	6796120	You're stuck on the wall. Oh, well, now you have three seconds to turn and go somewhere else.
6796120	6805120	And basically the effect of this is you won't die unless you trap yourself somehow, spiral, that sort of deal.
6805120	6809120	So you could just go there all day, and then the easy difficulty has no time limit.
6809120	6813120	So you could spend three hours on one level and take as much time as you need
6813120	6816120	so long as you don't trap yourself.
6816120	6822120	All right. Sounds like there's something for the young and the old alike in this game, so awesome.
6822120	6827120	Yeah, and if you're not sure whether you're young or old, if you start playing and then the game sees you're having trouble,
6827120	6830120	it'll offer to turn one of these handicaps on for you.
6830120	6837120	Huh, interesting. All right, very cool. Let's talk about the bigger picture for a minute, just community games in general.
6837120	6842120	Kind of not just your game, but all the other games kind of going in when the new Xbox experience launches.
6842120	6847120	We've heard kind of leading up to this launch, we've heard a lot about Netflix, we've heard a lot about avatars.
6847120	6852120	It seems to me for as big of a deal as at least I perceive this community games thing to be
6852120	6858120	where we have a lot of great indie developers showing up, we're not hearing as much about it as you would think.
6858120	6861120	You know, with all these, what, 20 games on the service right now.
6861120	6866120	Are you kind of surprised that there's been a little less focus on community games leading up towards the launch?
6866120	6872120	You know, on one hand I am, but on the other hand I'm really not because, you know, let's say I'm EA or Activision
6872120	6878120	or some other big-name publisher and I've got $60 games on the shelf from launching a new IP like Mirror's Edge.
6878120	6886120	And, you know, all of a sudden, Microsoft is promoting the heck out of all these little $5 and $10 and $2.50 games.
6886120	6889120	And I'm going to be a little bit, you know, pissed off.
6889120	6895120	And I'm going to be like, hey, hi, we want to keep selling our $60 games so you guys better lay off
6895120	6899120	and delay this to next year or we're going to stop publishing on your console.
6899120	6902120	That would be my point of view if I was a big-name publisher.
6902120	6906120	So I'd be, if I were them, I'd be happy that they're not plugging the heck out of this stuff.
6906120	6911120	And, excuse me, obviously these relationships are very important to Microsoft.
6911120	6916120	So, yeah, I'm kind of not surprised that we're a little under the radar.
6916120	6922120	But I think once people get a hold of the new NXC, they're definitely going to notice community games.
6922120	6925120	It's right there with Live Arcade and the Game Store.
6925120	6928120	If you go to the game marketplace, it's right there as a category.
6928120	6934120	And if you've been accepted into the NXC preview and you already have it, you can see plain as day
6934120	6936120	there are already 20 games on the service.
6936120	6939120	So the visibility is not going to be an issue.
6939120	6943120	I think it's going to kind of sneak up on people and really surprise them.
6943120	6945120	All right. Very cool.
6945120	6948120	You know, one thing, before we let you go, Aaron,
6948120	6950120	one thing we always like to ask our guests here on Orange Lounge Radio,
6950120	6952120	it's the same that we always do every week.
6952120	6954120	We want to ask you, how is your gaming week?
6954120	6958120	What other kinds of video games have you been playing besides Snake 360?
6958120	6961120	Well, you know what, this last week has been kind of crazy.
6961120	6966120	I took the whole week off from work, presumably to focus on Snake.
6966120	6970120	But then I basically came down with a really bad cold.
6970120	6976120	And my fiancé had a really bad cold as well, you know, starting last week and going into this week.
6976120	6983120	So I was very distracted all week, partially with Snake, partially with having a cold.
6983120	6986120	And then, of course, for a lot of times I couldn't stay focused.
6986120	6993120	So I diverted my attention with a little bit of Half-Life 2, which I hadn't really gotten to play very much of yet.
6993120	6995120	I'm enjoying it a lot.
6995120	7001120	I completed a few more of the advanced portal maps. I still have one left that I'm completely stuck on.
7001120	7005120	I picked up the new Namco compilation, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade,
7005120	7009120	which is a complete cash-in because it's so shoddily thrown together.
7009120	7015120	But it features every XBLA release Namco's had up to this point, and it was only 30 bucks.
7015120	7017120	So I'm a sucker for those.
7017120	7019120	And so I played that a little bit.
7019120	7027120	And I haven't been able to get out to an arcade, but I usually try to play a step game at least once a week.
7027120	7029120	It's the only kind of exercise I can do.
7029120	7031120	Well, Aaron, rest up and feel better.
7031120	7033120	I know we've been hearing you coughing a little bit tonight,
7033120	7039120	but I hope by the time this game launches you're well enough to celebrate when NXT comes out on November 19th.
7039120	7042120	So I'm really excited you were able to have me on here talking about it.
7042120	7049120	And I hope for all the arcade game fans, retro game fans, just fans of fun games.
7049120	7054120	I hope you guys could take a few minutes of your day to check out Snake 360.
7054120	7061120	The trial game will run for four minutes, and you'll be able to try out one of the courses on three different levels
7061120	7063120	and battle mode with two players.
7063120	7068120	And just give it a shot, and I appreciate giving it a try.
7068120	7074120	Alright, well the game is Snake 360, and it's launching with the new Xbox 360 experience on November 19th.
7074120	7077120	It has got a free time trial for you to check out the game.
7077120	7080120	And if you want the full game, it's only going to set you back 400 points.
7080120	7084120	If you want more information in the meantime, check out the website at Snake360.com.
7084120	7087120	Aaron, thanks so much for joining us tonight, and best of luck with the game.
7087120	7089120	I hope it does really well for you.
7089120	7092120	Oh, I hope so too. I'd love to quit my IT job.
7092120	7095120	But thank you very much, Rob, for having me on the program.
7095120	7098120	You know, Aaron's been in our chat room tonight while the interview has been going on,
7098120	7104120	and one interesting thing that I kind of learned during the whole thing is that he has to pay five bucks for his own game
7104120	7106120	on the community games thing.
7106120	7109120	He doesn't even get a free copy of his own dang game.
7109120	7111120	Boy, Microsoft runs a tight ship.
7111120	7113120	But I hope you guys will check out the demo.
7113120	7115120	At least look at the YouTube on the website.
7115120	7117120	It looks pretty rad.
7117120	7120120	Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news.
7120120	7129120	Yeah, speaking of retro games, you may remember the Atari 2600 Flashback systems that were released a while back.
7129120	7134120	They even had one that was in the true-to-life Woodgrain.
7134120	7142120	But now, the same company that brought those out are actually now bringing out USB Atari 2600 controllers.
7142120	7147120	You can actually use those to play whatever the heck you'd like.
7147120	7150120	But mostly, they're ideal for main usage.
7150120	7156120	And they are compatible, of course, with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
7156120	7160120	And will run you $1499.
7160120	7164120	Boy, they just love to whore out the old school Atari 2600 stuff, don't they?
7164120	7166120	Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
7166120	7171120	Well, going from an old school controller that's $1499 to something rather new school,
7171120	7173120	who doesn't love to play pinball?
7173120	7175120	Right, Dark Soccer? You love pinball.
7175120	7176120	Pinball is fantastic.
7176120	7180120	You spend a lot of money on pinball, but you buy the authentic pinball machines.
7180120	7184120	I don't know how big of a fan you are of video pinball games, you know, the types of things.
7184120	7185120	Some.
7185120	7190120	Okay. Would you be willing to spend $300 on your obsession?
7190120	7192120	Depends. Is it like an ultracade?
7192120	7193120	Well, here it is.
7193120	7197120	Nanotech Entertainment is putting out what's called a pinball wizard controller.
7197120	7205120	Real flipper buttons, an actual plunger, motion sensing thing for the tilting on it, $300 for the controller.
7205120	7206120	Very interesting.
7206120	7207120	I'd do it.
7207120	7214120	You'd have to be pretty, pretty sick into this in order to justify this, but Nanotech is putting this out.
7214120	7217120	It is the pinball wizard controller.
7217120	7223120	It's got what's called a motion ion or whatever, mode ion motion, IO adapter.
7223120	7225120	No special drivers required for this.
7225120	7228120	It's apparently fully configurable.
7228120	7232120	It will work with a lot of existing pinball games that are out there right now,
7232120	7236120	something they call a fancy-smancy future pinball engine.
7236120	7237120	Wow.
7237120	7243120	Apparently it ships with a combination of a variety of different 3D pinball games already out there.
7243120	7248120	Some recreations of famous pinball tables from Gotlib.
7248120	7250120	I don't know what tables those are yet, though. That has been said.
7250120	7253120	But you can keep an eye out for more information on this.
7253120	7255120	Nanotech Entertainment.
7255120	7257120	It's nanotechent.com.
7257120	7259120	All I gotta say is the who will sue.
7259120	7261120	Why is that, pinball wizard?
7261120	7263120	I know, because of the name, right?
7263120	7269120	I think that by now, you know, it should be fair use.
7269120	7272120	We'll see. I don't know. It's a little much for me.
7272120	7275120	I'd rather just take the plunge and get a real machine.
7275120	7278120	I need one already, but they're so expensive.
7278120	7280120	I don't have the money.
7280120	7284120	And yeah, I got that collection on the Wii. That's pretty awesome.
7284120	7286120	I guess I can just keep that for now.
7286120	7293120	Well, there is something that actually is a little interesting, I should say.
7293120	7298120	As far as some stuff for Rock Revolution.
7298120	7302120	If anyone is actually interested in it.
7302120	7305120	Who's interested in that game?
7305120	7310120	Rock Revolu- you know, as I said, I'm still curious to check it out.
7310120	7312120	I'm just waiting for the price to drop, which should happen soon.
7312120	7315120	But I also love the movie Showgirls.
7315120	7318120	So, take my opinion with a grain of salt.
7318120	7322120	Well, at any rate, there's some downloadable content for Xbox Live Marketplace.
7322120	7326120	There is Dezro Death Reel. That's a cool song.
7326120	7330120	Naoki, remixed by Kuro, which is my only shining star.
7330120	7337120	Mutsuhiko Izumi with model DD8.
7337120	7342120	Daisuke Kurosawa with Progressive Baby and Chimera.
7342120	7345120	Okay, so despite all the crap we've given Rock Revolution and saying,
7345120	7347120	why don't they just bring out Guitar Freaks over here?
7347120	7352120	Interesting, yet non-surprising that some of these tracks are, you know, crossover.
7352120	7356120	At least the artists are, certainly, from those series coming over to Rock Revolution.
7356120	7358120	Interesting.
7358120	7366120	There actually is a press release also out by Konami stating that it actually is shipping.
7366120	7372120	It will be $129.99 and is available for Xbox 360 and PS3.
7372120	7375120	Alright, well, check it out if you really want.
7375120	7377120	Yeah.
7377120	7383120	Now, what's kind of interesting is, you know, we talk about game piracy a lot.
7383120	7388120	Well, there was one game, actually, that was out there, World of Goo, that was actually pretty good.
7388120	7393120	It was more of a puzzle game that came out on PC and WiiWare.
7393120	7400120	What's interesting, though, is the developer actually has come out, designer Ron Carmel,
7400120	7406120	who mentioned that his game has received a 90% piracy rate.
7406120	7413120	And, yeah, apparently he's been doing some research in the different torrent sites with, you know,
7413120	7420120	some torrents with 500 cedars and 300 leechers and received emails from people who initially stole the game,
7420120	7424120	but ended up buying the full product.
7424120	7433120	And it's kind of interesting to see that smaller developers like this are really affected by piracy quite a bit.
7433120	7438120	It's kind of neat, though, remember they had a t-shirt for this at one time,
7438120	7441120	remember they were doing that Target thing with independent games tied in?
7441120	7442120	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7442120	7444120	Yeah, too bad that never happened.
7444120	7446120	It happened for like a week.
7446120	7448120	Yes, exactly.
7448120	7450120	That was kind of sad.
7450120	7453120	Remember there was a rumor that they were going to be going to like Hot Topic or something like that?
7453120	7454120	Yeah, whatever happened.
7454120	7457120	Yeah, that never happened either because apparently, you know, Twilight's a lot more popular.
7457120	7460120	I was going to say, all the shelf space got taken up by Twilight gear.
7460120	7463120	Twilight and I'm trying to think of what else Retarded had there.
7463120	7466120	Because who doesn't love vampires that sparkle?
7466120	7467120	I mean, really.
7467120	7468120	Sparkle vampires.
7468120	7472120	World of Goo, sparkling vampires, I just don't know.
7472120	7474120	I just don't know.
7474120	7481120	You know, part of me wants to see Twilight, but I also want to remind you, I like Showgirls.
7481120	7485120	I get to go see it for free the night before it comes out.
7485120	7487120	Do you? Are you going to review it for us here on the show?
7487120	7490120	I guess. I'm trying to get out of it.
7490120	7500120	Because as it is, I managed to get a couple extra tickets for Irene and Nellie's mom.
7500120	7504120	But my sister might want to go see it, so I'm going to try to see if she can go to my place.
7504120	7508120	But I don't think that's going to happen, so I probably will have to see it.
7508120	7511120	Kuroishi in chat says, oh yeah, and those Candy Mountain shirts.
7511120	7515120	I own one of those, thank you very much. I bought the Candy Mountain shirt at Hot Topic.
7515120	7517120	Candy Mountain, Charlie.
7517120	7519120	Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
7519120	7521120	Dark Soccer, are you going to be buying tickets to see Twilight?
7521120	7524120	I'm dying to know what you feel about Twilight.
7524120	7527120	If somebody buys them for me.
7527120	7531120	I was just curious if you were a fan or not a fan.
7531120	7533120	I want to read the books first.
7533120	7535120	Understandable.
7535120	7541120	By the way, there's a new trailer apparently for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that's showing before Twilight that looks pretty hot.
7541120	7542120	I wouldn't be surprised.
7542120	7543120	If you're a Harry Potter fan.
7543120	7545120	Well maybe that'll be worth going to see it.
7545120	7547120	Harry Potter!
7547120	7552120	And a new trailer for Star Trek is apparently in front of the new James Bond movie.
7552120	7555120	Which I need to go see. I love James Bond.
7555120	7561120	Have you seen the new trailer? Speaking of trailers, since we're totally off topic right now, a new trailer for Watchmen?
7561120	7565120	No, I haven't seen the new trailer. Just the last one with the Smashing Pumpkins song.
7565120	7571120	Because I'm actually reading the graphic novel there.
7571120	7576120	So a lot of the stuff that I've seen in the graphic novel, obviously I can see in the trailer, it's kind of cool.
7576120	7584120	What's interesting though is one of the songs that's in the trailer is a song that's on one of the radio stations in Grand Theft Auto IV.
7584120	7589120	Actually it's the trailer, the song that they used when they first teased Grand Theft Auto IV.
7589120	7592120	They had their teaser trailer. It was that same song.
7592120	7596120	Hmm. Interesting. Lots of good movies on the lineup for next year.
7596120	7600120	A lot of anticipated movies. Of course we had a few of them this year between The Dark Knight and everything else.
7600120	7603120	By the way, doesn't Dark Knight come out on Blu-ray pretty soon?
7603120	7604120	Yeah, like the second or third.
7604120	7607120	Here's what I really want to know. When's Mamma Mia come out?
7607120	7609120	Actually shortly after that. I think it's like the 10th.
7609120	7610120	Awesome!
7610120	7612120	Or whatever that next Tuesday is.
7612120	7614120	Just in time for Christmas. Hint hint. Alright, anyhow.
7614120	7616120	Just in time for your SingStar ABBA.
7616120	7621120	Exactly. Oh man, December is now ABBA month here at the home of Roberts.
7621120	7625120	Anyhow, Left 4 Dead. Here's another game I've got to check out.
7625120	7629120	I've just got no freaking time left between all the Wrath of the Lich King I've been playing.
7629120	7634120	Left 4 Dead apparently brings some clues to other Valve games.
7634120	7636120	Team Fortress 2.
7636120	7643120	Apparently, according to Kotaku, one of their readers actually was looking through the Left 4 Dead demo and found something very interesting.
7643120	7648120	There's a little cereal called Choco Bites that's in the apartment that's in the game.
7648120	7655120	And apparently the back of the box promotes a free 6 inch Team Fortress 2 action figure.
7655120	7657120	It says collect all 10.
7657120	7662120	Apparently though, there's only 9 Team Fortress 2 classes out there right now.
7662120	7670120	So a 10th one is coming soon, apparently, if this little Easter egg is to be believed.
7670120	7675120	Very good catch though. I've got to say, that's pretty impressive. Somebody caught that.
7675120	7681120	But Valve? Valve has some pretty rabid fans and I understand why.
7681120	7685120	They are definitely masters of the first person genre, I would say.
7685120	7689120	Between Half-Life and Portal and now Left 4 Dead is generating tons of buzz.
7689120	7691120	People love their Valve, don't they?
7691120	7693120	They sure do, but guess what else people like?
7693120	7694120	What's that?
7694120	7695120	Rare.
7695120	7703120	There's actually an Easter egg in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts that says,
7703120	7712120	They're all in the pipeline, you know. New Killer Instinct, Battletoads and forced Gemini gains, even Ghoulies 2.
7712120	7716120	Oh, you'll never believe that. I've ruined my own humorous tape.
7716120	7718120	Hmm.
7718120	7720120	So.
7720120	7725120	Either they like to tease us in these games or I just don't know what it is anymore.
7725120	7731120	Well, we've had the tease with Killer Instinct before, so who knows?
7731120	7733120	What a tease that is.
7733120	7736120	Well, you know, there's been other games to do this before.
7736120	7743120	Like, remember my favorite one of those of all is the one in Final Fantasy VII when Cloud is nuts.
7743120	7751120	And he says Xenogias. As in Z-E-N-O-G-I-A-S.
7751120	7752120	Yeah.
7752120	7753120	That'd be funny.
7753120	7756120	That'd be funny if the people translating it weren't told about Xenogears.
7756120	7759120	Kind of going back to the whole Left 4 Dead thing.
7759120	7764120	They should make some other games in the whole Half-Life Valve universe.
7764120	7770120	Including, I think, that they should make one based off the parody Half-Life Full Life Consequences.
7770120	7772120	If you've ever seen that video, it's hilarious.
7772120	7774120	No, I have not. Sorry to say.
7774120	7776120	It's hilarious. Retarded.
7776120	7782120	Good comment from chat, kind of going back a story, talking about the whole Team Fortress 2 thing.
7782120	7785120	Seg has an interesting thought on what that could be all about.
7785120	7789120	He says, I think that the 10th is actually the announcer for an action figure.
7789120	7793120	The announcer is the 10th character, and the announcer could be an action figure.
7793120	7797120	So no new class, just the acknowledgement that the announcer is the 10th character.
7797120	7798120	Interesting theory.
7798120	7801120	An action figure? Huh?
7801120	7805120	Were you listening to the story? The back of the box teases, collect all 10 action figures.
7805120	7807120	Oh, and the announcer is the 8th.
7807120	7808120	There you go.
7808120	7810120	I thought they were actually making action figures, which would be awesome.
7810120	7812120	No, but that would be kind of rad too, don't you think?
7812120	7814120	Alright, anyhow.
7814120	7816120	That's it for the stories tonight until we get to some last minute stories.
7816120	7819120	But now is the part of the show where we like to open up the Skype line.
7819120	7821120	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7821120	7823120	Or our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.
7823120	7826120	Our 800 number is toll free in the US and Canada.
7826120	7830120	But if you're in Europe or somewhere far away, you might want to consider using Skype.
7830120	7832120	Because it's going to cost you money otherwise.
7832120	7834120	Meanwhile, while we wait for a call to come in...
7834120	7836120	Oh, never mind. We've got calls coming in right now.
7836120	7838120	We'll hold off on last minute stories for just a little bit.
7838120	7841120	Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?
7841120	7843120	This is Akhil Ripper.
7843120	7845120	Yes, we do.
7845120	7848120	How are you doing, Akhil Ripper? What's on your mind tonight?
7848120	7850120	Well, I'm...
7850120	7852120	Well, what was I?
7852120	7855120	Just ranting about the Left 4 Dead.
7855120	7857120	Ranting about Left 4 Dead.
7857120	7860120	That's just completely awesome.
7860120	7863120	Tell us something about Left 4 Dead.
7863120	7866120	Because I don't think any of us in studio have actually got a chance to really play it yet.
7866120	7869120	I know it's kind of on the list of things we want to do.
7869120	7872120	But I know for me, I still have the Mirror's Edge demo to play too.
7872120	7875120	But there's been another game taking up a lot of my time.
7875120	7877120	If you haven't heard.
7877120	7881120	Well, plus you are, as we all know, a WoW addict.
7881120	7883120	Yes, we do.
7883120	7888120	We... what can I say?
7888120	7894120	We're an old WoW addict, sort of.
7894120	7897120	Recovering. Well, tell us about Left 4 Dead.
7897120	7900120	What makes this game so flippin' awesome?
7900120	7903120	Well, it is...
7903120	7906120	Well, you have... you are playing like four...
7906120	7910120	You have a maximum of four people.
7910120	7913120	And you are to survive.
7913120	7916120	Survive.
7916120	7921120	Like this stomping zombie assault.
7921120	7924120	That just blows you away, really.
7924120	7930120	It's so utterly good.
7930120	7932120	Now, if I... correct me if I'm wrong.
7932120	7934120	Even if you're playing this game by yourself.
7934120	7939120	You actually have like three other people with you that are all run by artificial intelligence, right?
7939120	7941120	How does that work? Is it good?
7941120	7945120	I would imagine that they would be stupid.
7945120	7949120	I haven't got much experience playing with bots, really.
7949120	7956120	Since... well, it's all about the multiplayer experience.
7956120	7963120	And playing it to online play.
7963120	7968120	That's the only thing that's interesting in my way.
7968120	7972120	Toshin in our chat room seems to think the bot AI is probably better than humans.
7972120	7976120	Act-Def agrees, though, that Left 4 Dead is really all about the multiplayer.
7976120	7982120	Yeah, but I would disagree.
7982120	7988120	Yeah, and the bots are, from my point of view, quite stupid.
7988120	7991120	Especially, really, if you...
7991120	8001120	Well, try... but then again, I'm not in one way super at shooters in a way, since...
8001120	8005120	Well, in one way, it's sort of weird in one way.
8005120	8016120	Since my take on most shooters, on single-play shooters that is, is that give me god mode and that's it, really.
8016120	8023120	But multiplayer shooters, you can't do that.
8023120	8027120	Good for me in one way, so I get to learn to play in one way.
8027120	8031120	So you can't cheat in this game. Well, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this game,
8031120	8035120	and Elise can check out the demo right now. It's out there.
8035120	8039120	Yeah, I have actually been playing the demo for a week now.
8039120	8040120	Wow.
8040120	8054120	The demo was released actually last Friday to us that pre-bought it.
8054120	8055120	Oh, pre-ordered?
8055120	8056120	Yeah.
8056120	8062120	I remember that this game, if I remember right, this had some of the longest lines of PAX, too, the previous of this game.
8062120	8066120	So a lot of people are definitely anticipating this one, and it's Valve. People love their Valve.
8066120	8067120	There you have it.
8067120	8071120	Yeah, but if you think of it, it hasn't, well, what is it?
8071120	8078120	It was originally shown at E3 in 2007, actually.
8078120	8093120	And then at some point it got a bit rewamped since all the four playable characters got completely new character rewamps.
8093120	8097120	And now it's looking pretty good.
8097120	8102120	All right. Well, okay, Ripper, we've got to let you go, but have a good time enjoying Left 4 Dead, the demo,
8102120	8105120	and have fun with the full game when it comes out, all right?
8105120	8106120	I will.
8106120	8108120	All right, take care. Take care, buddy.
8108120	8113120	All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8113120	8118120	And we'll take a couple more calls tonight, and then we've got to get to some last minute stories
8118120	8121120	and get on out of here for the night, if you can believe it.
8121120	8123120	All right, let's go ahead and go to the phones.
8123120	8126120	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8126120	8127120	Hello, this is Seg.
8127120	8130120	Hey, Seg, what's on your mind, buddy?
8130120	8143120	Well, earlier this week, Gamasutra put up an article about IP property in academia, specifically with game schools.
8143120	8155120	And the thing that really got me were the comments that the president of DigiPen really caught me off guard,
8155120	8162120	especially coming from a president of an educational institution.
8162120	8171120	Specifically, apparently the policy at DigiPen is that any intellectual property presented in the classroom
8171120	8179120	is solely owned by DigiPen, at least that's the policy as I understand it.
8179120	8191120	And as a graduate of a game design program, but at a different institution, Emerson College,
8191120	8201120	I found that really offensive to the student because it says that...
8201120	8210120	I know I'm skipping over some of the details on it, but apparently the reason that they chose to decide that,
8210120	8213120	oh, the school owns all the property and has all the control...
8213120	8218120	So just to clarify, you're saying if a student creates something for a class project, the school owns it?
8218120	8220120	At DigiPen, yes.
8220120	8233120	And the reason that he cites is that, oh, the IP laws are so complicated and it just makes things easier and all this.
8233120	8240120	And I just felt that that's missing a very large significant teaching moment,
8240120	8246120	an opportunity to the students by just pushing off to the side.
8246120	8254120	Now, at least with Emerson College, which is my personal experience,
8254120	8259120	the policy is basically a quasi-shared where Emerson...
8259120	8267120	I made a thesis video game called Antidote for my BFA thesis, and I own it.
8267120	8272120	It's mine with... I mean, I could put an asterisk on the software that I used and all that,
8272120	8280120	but as far as Emerson College's role, I use their equipment and they have a distribution license, pretty much.
8280120	8284120	They can showcase it as, here's what one of our students did.
8284120	8286120	But they don't own it.
8286120	8292120	They don't own everything, which allowed me the capability to do whatever I want with it.
8292120	8299120	Whereas students of DigiPen, apparently, don't have that ownership in their own thing.
8299120	8302120	I mean, for example, you may know a game called Portal.
8302120	8304120	Yeah, I've heard of it.
8304120	8305120	You may have heard of it.
8305120	8311120	It was actually a few students from DigiPen who created a game called Nebacular Drop, which...
8311120	8315120	I remember that.
8315120	8317120	So...
8317120	8319120	Oh, okay, weird.
8319120	8320120	No, go ahead.
8320120	8323120	There was the feedback loop.
8323120	8328120	They made Nebacular Drop and that was the game that got them the job at Valve.
8328120	8340120	But it was sort of just this gentleman's agreement that DigiPen wouldn't care that it's slightly similar because they got the jobs at DigiPen.
8340120	8342120	But it wasn't...
8342120	8349120	There's no guarantee that any student at DigiPen would get that affordance.
8349120	8357120	Is it possible that DigiPen does this, just theorizing here, maybe in a way to protect the students so that students aren't ripping off from each other?
8357120	8363120	Like, you see something really cool that another student presents and you're like, wow, maybe I want to kind of make that game someday.
8363120	8365120	Could it be a protection thing?
8365120	8367120	That's sort of afforded already.
8367120	8373120	I mean, somebody else outside of the classroom can also do that, regardless.
8373120	8387120	Here's my sort of test, and for anyone, not just for video games, but for anyone wanting to do a higher education in creative arts, and even not just creative arts,
8387120	8394120	is just ask the question, can I put my work in a Creative Commons license?
8394120	8400120	Can I choose, specifically choose, to do a creative license or not?
8400120	8411120	Because then you have the choice of where you want to put your work, and incorporating whether it be commercial or free or Creative Commons work into your work.
8411120	8423120	Because the sort of weird thing that hasn't been addressed is because DigiPen owns this work, you can't do copy left, apparently.
8423120	8440120	I mean, that's a murky area, and I'm not Mr. Lawyer here, but it kind of means that you can't do the copy left attributions that you're supposed to do if you use a Creative Commons license thing.
8440120	8451120	Because it's a restrictive copyright owned to one particular entity that doesn't allow you to copy left.
8451120	8456120	You know, I didn't see the story on Commons Studio, but now I'm very curious about it, especially if there's any kind of follow up to it.
8456120	8461120	Because you would think at some point this is going to be challenged, you know, when one of the students creates something they want to make.
8461120	8469120	The comments on there have been rather debated extensively.
8469120	8475120	And there are other schools, I mean, the thing that gets me is that this isn't unique to the video game industry.
8475120	8484120	People like to make that oppression, but it's not. It's general creative endeavors.
8484120	8493120	Well, you know, I studied television and radio when I was in college, and one of the classes I was in we had to write a script for a TV show, basically.
8493120	8495120	But we essentially owned it, you know what I mean?
8495120	8504120	It wasn't something that we would write a script and the college would own it, but at the same time we were encouraged, if we wanted to, to write a script based on a show that was already out there.
8504120	8512120	Exactly. And let's say you wrote that script that was heavily lifted off of something, it would be all null and void.
8512120	8518120	But then you got the plagiarism, which is already policies in any college, and that counts as plagiarism and all that.
8518120	8525120	But for some reason at our school it kind of didn't matter, because obviously you weren't going to say, it was just for a school project, you know, whatever.
8525120	8530120	But there were some people that were writing scripts that they planned to use someday in the real world.
8530120	8532120	Exactly.
8532120	8548120	And I just find it very troubling that this certain academic institution wants to not only not teach IP policy, I mean, those were classes that I was required...
8548120	8560120	I basically went to a film school and created my own little curriculum for interactive media within the New Media program.
8560120	8573120	But there were a lot of kids who made their foundation and were able to travel off from that independently of the college, because they had the capability of doing so.
8573120	8581120	And it strikes me that DigiPen doesn't do that, or want people to do that.
8581120	8598120	It just seems that they're more centered on making people that will fit into a role in a larger company, and denying the choice of having students not only form a grander knowledge of the industry,
8598120	8612120	and being an actual participant and professional that is aware of the industry, but just making people that fit into smaller slots.
8612120	8621120	And I think that's a missed opportunity for students, to box them in that way.
8621120	8630120	I can't talk about this for too much longer, but I gotta read some comments from chat, because chat room has some very interesting things to say.
8630120	8636120	YYR, who happens to be Aaron, who we talked to earlier in the show about Snake 360 says,
8636120	8646120	Just to clarify, Microsoft doesn't touch your IP if you publish a game on XNA, but the flip side of the coin, they're not responsible if you get sued over IP infringement and so on.
8646120	8647120	Exactly.
8647120	8654120	Bobby from the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf says something else interesting here, he's done some stuff with game design, I know he's played around with XNA.
8654120	8661120	You know, I really thought this was standard with game design colleges. This is the first time I've heard of a game design curriculum that didn't own your homework.
8661120	8669120	Hell, the last company I worked for owned anything I created as a program, even on my off hours, because I was dumb, and didn't contest that portion of the employment contract.
8669120	8685120	First of all, that's very different. In an employment context, that is extremely different. And the reason is that, in an employment context, you are being paid to do this work.
8685120	8702120	And that is completely different from being in an educational facility where you are paying or funding on your own, scholarships or whatever, to get an education to formulate a base for you to get to an employment situation or make your own company.
8702120	8720120	So it's vastly different than employment. In the employment context, yes, you were doing work for hire, but in the educational aspect, you're not doing this work for hire.
8720120	8734120	I just want to clarify real quick, the company that he did, it was actually a defense contractor company, but they would still own the games he created on the weekend. But I guess the difference here is, in a school, you pay them, in a company, they pay you.
8734120	8763120	Now, like in California, there's laws that prevent a company from having that overreach, where as long as you do not use company equipment, you are not on company time, and you don't use company-specific knowledge, the company you're employed to cannot take claim of anything you do, as long as there's that separation.
8763120	8776120	Of course, not every state is California. But that's also in the legal framework of you're being paid to do creative work. But in an educational environment, you're not being paid to do work.
8776120	8803120	You're paying them, if anything, for a rental fee. I had to reduce it so simply. But you're paying the institution for that, and there's no precedence for that, besides very few colleges making that sort of ownership policy, which a lot of colleges don't really go that far.
8803120	8814120	They may have some influence, some collusion there, but to have complete and utter ownership like that is not very common.
8814120	8833120	Thank you for bringing up a topic, especially on a night when we've been talking about moderation, and talking about these usage rights. I think sometimes these are things a lot of people don't think about that goes on behind the scenes.
8833120	8844120	Regardless, for anyone out there who is looking to apply to colleges or knows someone who does, regardless of the field, these are questions you should ask.
8844120	8858120	I'm not saying that you should not completely avoid any one institution based on their policy, but this is something you should know as an informed applicant in order to really give an evaluation of a school.
8858120	8860120	In other words, be aware.
8860120	8867120	Be aware. This is something you should ask the admission counselor regardless of whatever field, even if it's creative or not.
8867120	8872120	This is something you should be aware about before you make your decision for your higher education.
8872120	8878120	Very good advice, especially considering we have a lot of people around that age that listen to this program saying thanks so much for the insight. Always appreciate it.
8878120	8880120	Thanks for having me. It's always great to be on the show.
8880120	8886120	Alright, you are most welcome. Take care. And hey, I hear there's another episode of Homestar Runner coming out very soon.
8886120	8893120	Now, now, first of all, I'm only representing myself and being only myself.
8893120	8894120	Alright, fair enough.
8894120	8896120	But there's also that coming around the bit.
8896120	8898120	Alright, sounds good.
8898120	8899120	Alright, take care everybody.
8899120	8902120	You too, buddy. Bye bye.
8902120	8908120	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-LR, we're probably going to do one more quick, quick call and then we're going to call it a night.
8908120	8910120	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8910120	8913120	Oh, it's me. What's up guys?
8913120	8915120	Not much. What's up?
8915120	8928120	Nah, just hanging in there, just trying to like, you know, since I'm currently unemployed right now because that job market is like busting my balls right now, I'm just holding myself back from gaming in general.
8928120	8931120	Except for the stuff that I managed to get for free.
8931120	8945120	But yeah, let me see, I just found out over the weekend that Capcom, in their most infinite wisdom, quote unquote, you know, I'm being sarcastic here, has decided to hold back, you know, the arcade release of Street Fighter IV.
8945120	8951120	Effectively, you know, just saying, fuck you, we're not going to do it, go fuck off, the arcade industry is dead.
8951120	8961120	Which is pretty, I mean, I don't blame them though. I guess I don't blame them because, you know, fighting games, especially in the arcade level, are kind of, have been relegated to a niche recently.
8961120	8973120	It's not like DDR where it has that casual appeal where people can just like, you know, easily jump on it, you know, jump into it without any risk.
8973120	8981120	Whereas you've got fighting games that are much more difficult, they have a much higher learning curve in terms of moves and all that.
8981120	8986120	Zaku, I hate to kind of throw you a curve ball here, but you made a very interesting comment on the last call.
8986120	8989120	The kind of tizing, because you're talking about job market, economy, blah blah blah.
8989120	9000120	You were mentioning on kind of, to SEG's phone call here, when I worked full time as a mobile software engineer, I had to sign a typical confidentiality agreement basically stating that anything I wrote or ran on their machines became essentially theirs.
9000120	9007120	In light of what's happened, what do you think about kind of everything we've been talking about?
9007120	9016120	From what I, I actually read that story earlier this week, you know, about DigiPen basically, you know, and their policy on owning everything you pretty much submit to them.
9016120	9021120	Which is kind of typical. It's kind of typical for how a company operates.
9021120	9031120	You know, where if you're working in software engineering for example, or any work for hire stuff that you do at freelance levels, you pretty much don't own the content.
9031120	9036120	The creator, you know, the actual, the person who commissioned it actually does.
9036120	9041120	In this case, you know, the person commissioning in a software engineering company is the company itself.
9041120	9049120	You know, it needs employees to actually, you know, like me as a software engineer to actually type in the code on the screen and make it work.
9049120	9054120	But, you know, it does, you know, it does worry me somewhat.
9054120	9059120	But then again, I don't, you know, I don't really, I can really understand why they do it.
9059120	9061120	Just to cover their own asses.
9061120	9065120	In case, you know, they want to, they want to avoid as much litigation as possible.
9065120	9070120	In terms of, you know, who owns the IP, the school, or the student.
9070120	9079120	And, you know, yeah, it does, it basically, it solves a lot of problems before they even, you know, before they even creep up.
9079120	9090120	I know it's a sad reality that, you know, many, many people actually submit, you know, submit work and then realize that, oh, oh, oh crap, I might have used a good idea.
9090120	9096120	And then now they're screwed because it's going to take a while to create something much better than what you already submitted.
9096120	9100120	Because you can't use it anymore because it's someone else who owns it.
9100120	9107120	Zach, I've got another kind of interesting question for you because, you know, you talking about having gotten laid off in the mobile company kind of makes me think about this.
9107120	9113120	I don't think I mentioned this earlier in the program, but earlier this week I was actually interviewed by the local news.
9113120	9121120	They were doing a story about the Warcraft launch and they wanted to talk about how video games are like economy.
9121120	9134120	They're kind of economy, in spite of our falling economy, people were still lining up to buy this game, you know, and I'm using Warcraft for example, but they were kind of talking about how video games were economy, they were rescission proof.
9134120	9138120	And I said, sorry, recession, recession proof.
9138120	9146120	And I was trying to say they're not so much recession proof as they are recession resistant, because they're still, you know, you look at what happened at EA a couple weeks ago.
9146120	9153120	I'm sure that Wii's might still be selling like hotcakes and so on, but it's not, all areas are not recession proof.
9153120	9160120	Of course, I mean, you have basically game devs that are failing left and right, shutting down, laying off people.
9160120	9165120	You know, it's probably because they're not taking in enough money for the games that they're selling.
9165120	9177120	But on the other hand, on the consumer level, you realize that people, you know, games right now are much cheaper than any big ticket luxury items like iPods or flat screen TVs.
9177120	9184120	I mean, even the used game market is still thriving right now because of the recession, because people want to play for cheap.
9184120	9194120	That's why, you know, GameStop's making a killing right now with the, you know, with the used games that they have on the, you know, right there in the bins.
9194120	9198120	Because people want to, you know, they want instant satisfaction in that sense.
9198120	9206120	And some of them are willing to save up for something, you know, something like $50 or $60 for like one game, must have game of this year.
9206120	9211120	You know, personally, I would pick Fallout 3 over Left 4 Dead, but that's just me.
9211120	9218120	But people have their, you know, they're going to be saving up for something, for that one thing they want to get this year.
9218120	9224120	Since the economy's, you know, really going under and they're not in the position to actually spend as much as they did last year.
9224120	9229120	Alright, well, Zaku, we got to wrap up and let you go, but any other quick last thoughts for our listeners?
9229120	9240120	Let me see, the arcade scene's not dead, it's just going through a, just going, it just basically got hit in the stomach, it's just trying to get up right now.
9240120	9242120	Alright.
9242120	9245120	Alright, Zaku, take care buddy, thanks for the call.
9245120	9247120	And good luck on the job hunt.
9247120	9249120	Thanks, bye.
9249120	9250120	Bye.
9250120	9252120	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
9252120	9254120	It's a very interesting call tonight.
9254120	9260120	That's what I freaking love about this show, is letting the listeners kind of call in to talk about what they want to.
9260120	9263120	And sometimes they bring up some really interesting topics.
9263120	9272120	So just the whole IP thing and talking about people that are, you know, actually in the games industry and the economy and its effects and fascinating stuff.
9272120	9277120	Last minute stories tonight, Dark Sakura, Loki, anybody, last minute stories for us tonight?
9277120	9278120	I like pie.
9278120	9281120	I do too, I want some pumpkin pie, real bad.
9281120	9283120	Loki, any pie-licious stories for us?
9283120	9288120	No, I don't have pie-licious stories, but this is kind of cheesy.
9288120	9290120	Mmm, cheesecake?
9290120	9292120	You can put cheese on apple pie.
9292120	9300120	Anyways, Uwe Boll has been charged, no, hold on, hold on, he's not making another movie.
9300120	9302120	Well at least this is not an announcement of another movie.
9302120	9310120	He's being charged with libel and is being forced to pay a 2.1 million dollar fine.
9310120	9317120	Apparently he had bad mouthed the Fantastic Films International Company, the very film distributor handling his movies.
9317120	9326120	And now he lost his court case and so now he has to pay money, oops.
9326120	9328120	So that's kind of funny.
9328120	9329120	Hilarious.
9329120	9330120	Hilarious.
9330120	9334120	That's what he gets for being a dick!
9334120	9339120	And then, what else was I looking up here?
9339120	9340120	Not too much.
9340120	9342120	Probably pornography.
9342120	9348120	No, not pornography, I was looking up some old videos of the Half-Life 2 stuff.
9348120	9352120	You know, Half-Life, Full Life, something or other.
9352120	9360120	Anyways, the same guy did some other videos called the Idiots of Gary's Mod and they're hilarious.
9360120	9368120	And I also found a cam recording of the new Star Trek trailer.
9368120	9370120	I actually watched that as well.
9370120	9373120	It looks interesting. It doesn't look like a Star Trek trailer at first.
9373120	9376120	I watched it with no sound.
9376120	9381120	You don't need sound to see how awesome Siler is as Spock.
9381120	9383120	That's all I'm saying, yo.
9383120	9386120	Alright, well, it sounds like that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9386120	9388120	We gotta wrap up! Get on out of here!
9388120	9389120	In ribbons and bows?
9389120	9391120	That's right, in ribbons and bows.
9391120	9395120	Next week is the week before Thanksgiving, if you can believe it.
9395120	9397120	Time is flying before you know what Christmas is going to be here.
9397120	9398120	It's not loud!
9398120	9401120	No, Rob, you have to be politically correct!
9401120	9402120	It's the holiday!
9402120	9404120	I'm sorry, the Harvest Festival, whatever.
9404120	9406120	You know what, you know what, you know what.
9406120	9407120	What?
9407120	9412120	We had a discussion about this in my team meeting network.
9412120	9415120	They're like, okay, who is offended if we say Christmas?
9415120	9416120	No one raised their hand.
9416120	9418120	Okay!
9418120	9424120	We're calling it whatever we want to in this room and then we'll call it the holiday.
9424120	9426120	The appreciation.
9426120	9434120	Most Jewish people I've talked to, Jewish being the biggest religion and most obvious one that doesn't do Christmas, they do Hanukkah instead, right?
9434120	9438120	Most Jewish people I know are kind of used to it and don't take personal offense to it.
9438120	9441120	And kind of get into the whole celebration thing.
9441120	9443120	You can celebrate the secular holiday.
9443120	9444120	Exactly!
9444120	9445120	I mean, to be perfectly honest.
9445120	9449120	They get into the Hallmark side of it, but not the meaning behind it necessarily.
9449120	9457120	To be perfectly honest, you know, my own celebration is yule, you know, if our fireplace wasn't shit, I'd be burning a log every year.
9457120	9460120	You know, it's just whatever, you know.
9460120	9476120	Christmas itself, as most people know it in the Western world, is a secular holiday given a name by the Catholic Church to convert pagans because Jesus was not born in December.
9476120	9478120	It was October.
9478120	9480120	So Halloween is closer to Jesus' birthday?
9480120	9481120	Yes.
9481120	9482120	Alright, just curious.
9482120	9484120	It'll be whenever they do the census.
9484120	9488120	Alright, look, I don't want to get into religion chat too deep on a video game show.
9488120	9491120	No, I think it's funny, but that's okay.
9491120	9498120	Alright, but we'll do a politically incorrect Christmas and deal with it special or something like that.
9498120	9501120	Yes, and act deft refers to zombie Jesus.
9501120	9507120	Alright, maybe we'll do a Christmas gaming marathon or politically incorrect.
9507120	9509120	Gaming marathons are the big thing right now.
9509120	9514120	People playing games for hours and hours on end to raise money for charity.
9514120	9516120	We need to do something like that here at Orange Andredo.
9516120	9517120	I don't know how or when.
9517120	9518120	A play-a-thon?
9518120	9519120	Yeah, a play-a-thon.
9519120	9520120	As long as it's not TDR.
9520120	9522120	No, we need to play like obscure games.
9522120	9524120	Like we'll let the users vote on what we're going to play.
9524120	9527120	How about, you know, I should catalog my collection.
9527120	9532120	As long as they don't pick some of the shit that's in my collection because I do have some shit in the collection.
9532120	9534120	We should pool like 40 games.
9534120	9536120	Act deft says guardian legend.
9536120	9537120	That can be one of the games.
9537120	9541120	Like every hour play a new game and let the chatroom vote on what game we play each hour.
9541120	9543120	I'm totally, totally down for that.
9543120	9544120	We should do something like that.
9544120	9545120	It'll be fun.
9545120	9547120	And we'll call it our, you know, Christmas marathon.
9547120	9551120	Alright.
9551120	9553120	Who called it Jesusween?
9553120	9555120	That's great.
9555120	9556120	Alright, anyhow.
9556120	9561120	We'll try to figure out that idea and bring you more on that a little later.
9561120	9563120	And we can open up the studio.
9563120	9564120	You don't have to talk to my roommate about it.
9564120	9567120	We can open up the studio and have people in and out of here throughout the hour and something like that.
9567120	9569120	Anyhow, we've got to wrap up.
9569120	9570120	Get out of here for the night.
9570120	9572120	So everybody's final thought.
9572120	9574120	Loki, your final thought for us tonight?
9574120	9577120	I have a headache now too.
9577120	9581120	My final thought tonight is child's play.
9581120	9584120	Because Sega is screaming in chatroom.
9584120	9585120	Mention child's play.
9585120	9586120	Child's play is on now. Mention.
9586120	9588120	So there you go. Child's play.
9588120	9594120	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
9594120	9597120	I think Dark Sakura is zombie Jesus.
9597120	9598120	Alright.
9598120	9602120	I just found out one of my zip drives has escaped my keychain somehow.
9602120	9603120	That sucks.
9603120	9605120	I hope there is not pornography in there.
9605120	9607120	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight.
9607120	9610120	Thanks you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.
9610120	9613120	Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.
9613120	9614120	Spread the word.
9614120	9616120	We really appreciate it.
9616120	9619120	Well, that's how Aaron from Snake360 got on the show in the first place.
9619120	9623120	Because a friend of his told him about the show and worked out the whole interview thing with us.
9623120	9630120	So it just goes to show, no matter where you are in the game playing spectrum, whether you just play them or you write them,
9630120	9633120	spread the word about Orange Launch Radio because we are a community based program.
9633120	9637120	And if you have no friends or you're just feeling up to it because you want to really help,
9637120	9640120	leave us a nice review on iTunes, a nice five star review on there.
9640120	9644120	Or any of those other podcasting sites throughout the internet because it also helps us spread the word.
9644120	9649120	Because that's all we got. No fancy magazines or TV stations backing us up, just us.
9649120	9651120	And we got to take on those big boys all ourselves.
9651120	9653120	So that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.
