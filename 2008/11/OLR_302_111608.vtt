Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco the King!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, November 16, 2008, Wii music sales are initially disappointing,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
an old video game movie is getting upgraded for Blu-ray,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and is LittleBigPlanet bound for the PSP?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello, Internets, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that podcast and live program dedicated to video games,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Roar. How are you? Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Tonight is the episode where we will be speaking to ourselves in animal speak all night long.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Arf. Meep meep meep meep meep meep meep meep.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Alright. And also say hello to meep meep meep. Awwww. Awwww. Meep meep. Loki.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm not participating in this.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
No, we have to speak Simlish.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
We're speaking Simlish tonight?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Since that is a little more video game related.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Run through a translation filter back into English.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
How are you doing, Loki? Seriously though?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Pretty good.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Alright. Good good.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Alright. Well, you know how it works here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
We do a little program here for about three hours talking about the latest and greatest in gaming.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
You know, the show kind of started as us sitting around the table at dinner after a long night of playing DDR

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and fighting games at a local arcade and some pinball and all that good stuff.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Once in a while golf, maybe.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And just talking trash about games and other things going on in our lives.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And kind of carried over onto this little program.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
We invite you all to our dinner table through our chat room.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com when we tape live on Sunday nights at AllGames.com

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
at about six o'clock Pacific Standard Time right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Let's start off tonight's show as we always do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And we'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I played something other than Ragnarok.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Although I did play a lot of Ragnarok.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh my gosh. What?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I played and you saw me play it.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The Doctor Who Top Trumps game that thanks to one of our lovely listeners sent to me.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Thank you, Rob.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Not this Rob, but that Rob. Thank you.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
And something will be on its way to you as soon as I am no longer broke.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
But it's cool. I'd never played any Top Trumps game before.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
It's kind of, it's really simple.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
And I played one of the, I guess, ones in adventure mode.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And I did just a single game.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
And I had to play against a Slathine, which was, you know, I was like, eh, I don't like them.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
But I lost my first game. It wasn't, it wasn't very, you know, great losing my first game.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
But it's sort of like playing War.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
But you choose your stats on your card to play against someone else's stats on their card.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
And you play for cards too. And it's bizarre. So I, it's weird.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
So I'm going to try to practice a bit more at it and see if I can, if I can get any good at it.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
And I also have, even though I haven't played it yet, I have a Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
So I'm going to be hopefully giving that a try during the week if I actually have time because I've got two art projects due.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
And my Animal Crossing is coming tomorrow. So I'm glad for that.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
And I've also been playing a little bit of Fable, Fable 2. So that's it.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Sweet. Have you been playing anything fun?

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
Um, I guess. Now I played this week, More Saints of War 2, because I've already finished the game.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
But I'm going for 100% completions. So I've been playing through the mini games.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Which are actually pretty easy so far. I think some of them are difficult.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
Like, um, some of the insurance fraud can be difficult because it's kind of random of what cars come and how many times you can get hit and that kind of thing.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
Um, but like I finished the septic adventure part where you spray sewage onto people and property.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And that's funny. Because you fling poo at them.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
And um, I also played through some of the helicopter assault stuff which is also fun because you're just firing rockets at things.

04:25.000 --> 04:34.000
Um, then also went and played through some of the online of that. Trying to get some more, um, ranks and badges and stuff.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
And I wish it wasn't so cumbersome because to get into the ranked games it takes forever.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
And once you're done with that there's no like going back to a lobby or going into another game.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
It just kicks you out to the main menu and you have to go through the whole thing again and again.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
So that's kind of lame. But um, eventually I'll get enough trophies I guess if I stick with it long enough.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
But I am 80% done with the game so that's awesome.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.000
Um, then the other thing I've played this week. Of course we switched to Grand Theft Auto 4 for multiplayer because people got tired of me beating them all the time in Saints Row 2.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
So now they want me to beat them all the time in Grand Theft Auto 4. So that's what's been going on.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
It's a little tricky to go back to that game because the controls are a little different in Saints Row but I pick it up pretty quick.

05:19.000 --> 05:31.000
And uh, yeah. It's kind of boring. I hope that download content really adds something to the game because once you're done with Grand Theft Auto 4 there's really not much more you can do in there.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
Um, then other stuff I played. I got a copy of Mirror's Edge. I haven't really got a chance to play it but I watched my friend play it during lunch one day.

05:39.000 --> 05:49.000
And it looks really awesome. I liked the demo a bit even though it was hard but whatever. It looks fun. So I'm looking forward to checking that out.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
I went back and played some Rock Band 2 because I finally got my cymbals for my new drum set.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Because I vowed that I wouldn't play the drum set until I got the cymbals and now that I've got the cymbals it's pretty awesome.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Unfortunately I got only a 2 pack because they weren't selling the 3 packs yet. It sucks.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
Um, then I went ahead um, I didn't really get to play Animal Crossing this week but we did get it a little early.

06:16.000 --> 06:30.000
And uh, I've been watching my wife hog the game and you know, I played it at uh, packs and just from what I've seen it really is almost exactly the same as the other 2 games.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
Very minor changes and in fact there's a few things that are kind of neat in it but they don't even mention them at all.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Like apparently there's like an easter egg if you're uh, take a certain path each time.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
Like say you start the game and immediately run across this one bridge or something. Well eventually it will carve out a path for you.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Um, in the leaves or in the grass or something. So that's kind of a neat little easter egg.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
Nice little bit of innovation there. I wish they could have done it with I don't know the important parts of the game instead of like some of the crappy um, visuals.

07:01.000 --> 07:11.000
But seriously I don't think they're trying anymore. At least it seems like with these games that are coming out, I mean, I don't know about you Rob, but doesn't it seem like Nintendo's kind of stopped trying?

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Cause with Wii Music it didn't seem like they were really trying too hard there. Animal Crossing doesn't really seem to be that innovative now.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
And now they're actually porting GameCube games and adding Wii controls so I mean, how much more lazier can you get? I mean seriously.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I blame the economy. And the stock market and gas prices.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Economy my ass. Seriously, they're just wasting my time.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Um, then I've got a bunch of other stuff to play. Unfortunately I'm getting to the point now where I have too many things to play at once.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
Ubisoft sent me a copy of Sean White's Snowboarding for the 360 and then I got a copy of Rain Man's Raving Rabbids TV Party that I got to try out.

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
And DS games. I'm going to try playing Trackmania DS this week cause I like the PC version. Um, also Linerator 2 at some point.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
And I got a download code for Banjo-Kazooie so I'm probably able to try that cause I never really actually played the original.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
And, god, Fallout 3 at some point cause I still haven't finished that and I got to finish Fable 2 so it's busy.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
But, Animal Crossing does mark the last game I'm buying this year so that's nice. Oh, and Resistance 2. I still got to play that.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
Alright, wow, you've been very busy, Loki. Well, in comparison, I've been not as busy.

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
Pretty much one game has been taking up my entire week. Does anyone, I don't know, just out of curiosity, does anyone want to try and venture a guess what game I might have been playing most of this week?

08:38.000 --> 08:49.000
Sing Star Abba! Uh, no, that's not until December but that will be dominating December. Which I'm very disappointed Loki said he has no more games to buy this year cause there's at least one game left that everyone should be buying and that's Sing Star Abba.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
World of Crack Cocaine. Uh, yes, World of Crack Cocaine is Wrath of the Heroine King has been taking up most of my week.

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
No, obviously we're talking about Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King which the big expansion was released this week and, um, it's great.

09:04.000 --> 09:16.000
I mean, what am I going to say? Obviously I'm already addicted to WoW. What am I going to add to this? I will say this, they've really kind of kicked up a notch this expansion compared to the last one, the Burning Crusade.

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
Um, they, the new dungeons are pretty awesome, the three I've played so far, um, because the nice thing about them, they're pretty short.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
They're not going to take your, you know, two hours like some of the old Burning Crusade ones did and, uh, have a real epic feel for just five people.

09:32.000 --> 09:47.000
Uh, the most recent one I ran, Azul, Azul, Azul Grub, I keep mispronouncing the name, Azul Grub, it's the Spider Palace, um, is actually really awesome because it's nothing but epic boss fights for a five man which is, uh, pretty cool.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
And some of the quests are neat, um, they've added this whole new vehicle thing into the game which is kind of fun, kind of controls a little bit differently.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
Uh, and I think for lore fans, I'm not huge on the lore in WoW, but I know lore fans are really getting a kick out of this one with some of the twists that are on it.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
And, uh, you know, if you're into WoW, you probably already bought this game.

10:08.000 --> 10:20.000
If, um, you're somebody who used to play WoW that's debating coming back, um, you might want to take advantage of that offer that Blizzard's doing where you can get like the ten day free pass to Burning Crusade and all that.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
Because I'm going to tell you what, for new people, there's really not a lot in Wrath of the Lich King for you, that's actually probably the game's shortcoming.

10:27.000 --> 10:36.000
Um, whereas in Burning Crusade at least you have Blood Elves, Draenei, kind of, you know, like a way for new folks that are new to the game to experience the new content.

10:36.000 --> 10:45.000
Honestly, Lich King doesn't really have anything for new people. In order to play the new class, the Death Knight, you have to be level 55, uh, already.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
If, uh, you want to create, which, you know, for some old school WoW fans might be okay, um, but otherwise, you know, there's not a lot for new people.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
There's not a lot you're going to see at level one. Granted, you have a new profession, a haircut thing, but that's not worth 40 bucks for the expansion.

11:03.000 --> 11:12.000
But, um, if you do have a level 70 character, if you've, uh, quit WoW during the Burning Crusade and you're kind of curious what's changed with this, I definitely think Lich King is worth checking out.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
So, um, uh, definitely check out Wrath of Lich King, uh, if you're a Warcraft fan. If you're not, there's nothing here that's going to win you, win you over, I don't think.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
Although, I do think the questline so far in the dungeons from 70 to 80 have been awesome. And I love the music, too.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
The music has been very ambient and pretty awesome. And it has a zone called the Fjord. And who doesn't love the word Fjord?

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
And yes, it has Vikings and all that stuff, which is pretty awesome. And you get to kill them in the face.

11:37.000 --> 11:46.000
And it's pretty much been my gaming week. I also have gotten to get my grubby little hands on Animal Crossing. Um, I haven't really gotten to play it very much at all.

11:46.000 --> 11:59.000
Um, but I would agree. It's, uh, there's not a lot here we haven't seen. And kind of as I was saying on Bobby's show as we were doing the, um, tossover to our program tonight, um, the GameCube in a way was almost a better deal.

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
I mean, granted you have the online stuff now. And, you know, there's a few new things here and there. But you don't get to unlock the old school NES games anymore.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And, Loki, when we were talking about it on Bobby's show, you had a great idea for how Animal Crossing kind of put that magic back, right?

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, just, I mean, like they've been doing with some of their other Nintendo games that come out, add some minigames in there. Make some minigames.

12:20.000 --> 12:33.000
You can even make them like retro NES games or something like that. I mean, or even like was it with, um, you know, just have NES demos or something. Hell, they did it with Smash Brothers.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I don't know why that's such a big deal now or just something.

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
Game & Watch games for heaven's sakes. Just something, you know? Like, I don't know what it is about minigames, but hey, it is Nintendo after all, right?

12:44.000 --> 12:55.000
It just, it seems like that they're not trying, that they're just basically putting in the most basic content ever. And they're making it so that you don't have to play this, you know, multiple times a week or something like that.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
Even though you probably should if this is, you know, a game that you're going to be playing. Because that's how you play this, is you have to constantly go back and maintain stuff.

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
But, like, the city is literally all the, you know, special event stuff that would happen. You know, all the people coming and visiting your town, they're all in the city now.

13:10.000 --> 13:20.000
Which, the city is kind of lame. I wish it was like other villages. Maybe expand your village? Maybe, I don't know, make it look different? Put some effort?

13:20.000 --> 13:31.000
You know, here's what it is. I think, you know, whereas we loved Animal Crossing and the minigames thing I think is important because I remember, I don't know if you remember Dark Sakura, but when we were playing Animal Crossing and visiting each other's towns a lot,

13:31.000 --> 13:39.000
and Loki, of course, we did this too. It was pretty cool because you would be like, well, come over to my house. I have Clu Clu Land in my house. You have to come visit my village so you can play Clu Clu Land.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh, yeah? Well, I have, you know, the old school 8-bit pinball game that has Mario, you know.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I remember we had a lot of that going on.

13:47.000 --> 13:55.000
There was incentive to go back and forth and, you know, whereas, you know, at least you still have the items and things. Hey, come visit my shrine of fire and all this stuff.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Honestly, I think Animal Crossing has become a game for 10-year-olds.

13:58.000 --> 14:09.000
Which exclusively for the tween area, like, you know, the 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds. I don't think there's anything left for us old folks anymore.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
And what's really, what's the fear of actually putting virtual console games in this game?

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
Okay, so it may cut down on the sales of your virtual console games that you have featured in this.

14:21.000 --> 14:30.000
Who cares? They're digital. It's not like you have to manufacture discs. It costs you nothing. If anything, you sell more copies of Animal Crossing and you get more people to do it.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Hell, you could maybe even charge them as download content, you know.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
Or here's an idea. You know, the virtual console games that you have on your system you can put in your house or something like that.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
Or select ones. Like, say, if I own Super Mario Brothers, I can put Super Mario Brothers game in my game or something.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Or I can purchase Super Mario Brothers and put it in my house or something.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
It's just, it's lazy. All it is is lazy.

14:53.000 --> 15:01.000
You know, here's the thing about Nintendo. The disappointing thing for me as a hardcore gamer is that Nintendo is still going to sell like hotcakes this Christmas.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
Wii's are still going to be a must-have. Wii Fit is still going to sell like crazy. Soccer moms are going to buy this for their kids.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
And honestly, things like, you know, look, this has been like a recurring trend on this show.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
We bashed Wii music previously and said, but it's probably really good for 10-year-olds.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Here we are bashing Animal Crossing. But your 10-year-old will probably have a lot of fun with it.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Why would I get Wii Fit? I won't probably exercise much with it, but my 10-year-old probably will.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Wii, the Wii is not being taken seriously by a lot of us hardcore gamers anymore. It's the kids' system.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Remember though they were saying... Will it still sell? Sure.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
But they're going to lose a lot of credibility with us if they don't start turning around some games fast in 2009.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And to lose that brand loyalty is going to be painful.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Well, here's the thing. Remember before the GameCube, it was looked at as a kids' system.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
The Wii hasn't changed that at all. In fact, now they're really pushing it.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
That it's more of a kids' system or a casual game system. That's great, you know, if you want to make it for that.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
But you know there's people that play that that may want an actual game that's a little bit more hardcore or a little bit more...

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
Just, there's things you can do to make the games appeal to casual players and not-so-casual players.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Animal Crossing can still be very fun for a casual player, but change it! God damn it! Seriously!

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Just change it! Make it different than the last two that you've put out!

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
It's exactly... Can you imagine if Super Mario Bros. 3 came out?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
It was exactly the same as Super Mario Bros. 1 except it was a night or something.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
That's seriously what they're doing. It's just the same...

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
With Wii Speak.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah, it's seriously that bad. It's just they're not trying at all.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
And the sad thing is it's because it's Animal Crossing and people will buy it and they're not going to learn.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Okay, I've got to go to the chat room because there's some great comments in chat.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Frisbee starts us off tonight. Who in the freaking hell cares about ten-year-olds?

16:49.000 --> 16:59.000
Well, not us necessarily, but a sale of a Nintendo Wii and Animal Crossing and Wii Fit to a ten-year-old's mother is still a sale.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It's still money in Nintendo's pocket.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
That's fine if ten-year-olds are happy with Animal Crossing because maybe they didn't play the other versions of the game. That's fine.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
But they'll be equally disappointed when Animal Crossing 2 or whenever the next one comes out for the next Nintendo system.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
They're like, holy crap, this is exactly the same as the last one I played.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
And we'll be going, holy crap, it's exactly the same as the last three I've played.

17:17.000 --> 17:25.000
Quel Tipo in chat says, yeah, but at least GameCube had the debut of Resident Evil 4 to combat the supposed kiddiness and eternal darkness too.

17:25.000 --> 17:35.000
It still looks like a Nintendo 64 game. I mean, that's really, I have the Nintendo 64 version, so it's just, that's all it is.

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
It doesn't even have to be the look. It's just they didn't change, the towns are exactly, I mean, basically the same as the other ones.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
But maybe they're just saying the formula works, why mess with it?

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
Because I really don't have a lot of incentive to buy this game, although I guess I already have it, but, you know, to recommend it to others.

17:52.000 --> 18:02.000
Here's a very interesting counterpoint to your whole Mario at Night thing. Game Guru says someone hasn't played Lost Levels, which was Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
In a way, Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan was but Mario at Night.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But the levels were different.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
And he did have poison mushrooms, a difference between Mario and Luigi and so on.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Exactly.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
But the look was the same.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
It doesn't matter. The look can be the same for Animal Crossing.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
I have no problem with the look. The look can be exactly the same, but add something, make some little bit of a variety.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Add forests in there, add where you can travel to other towns within your town.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
It's not necessarily just one town, but like a community of towns, like a state or something, you know?

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Yet another great comment from Jenai in chat. Chat room's got great comments tonight.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Jenai in chat says Nintendo is really pissing on its fans for not bringing Mother 3 out.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
That's a great comment.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
So meanwhile, while they're cranking out these games, they've got a game that might appeal to us that they refuse to release here in the US.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Amazing.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Alright, well anyhow, that's pretty much going to do it for my gaming week.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
Let's get into some housekeeping news tonight, of which we don't have an awful lot, but I do want to make sure I announce here, towards the top of the show,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
we have a special guest joining us tonight. It's going to be awesome.

19:05.000 --> 19:13.000
I know you guys have heard about the Xbox 360 new Xbox experiences coming out pretty soon, this next coming week.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Well one thing that's going to be rolling out on this is the community games on the Xbox 360.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
You might remember when these things were first previewed a few months ago at the Game Developers Conference, I said,

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
this is it. This is going to be a huge thing. This is going to be like the YouTube for video games. This is going to be huge.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
And well, it's yet to be seen because it sure seems like Microsoft's not really selling this very much compared to the Netflix and the Avatars,

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
but it doesn't mean the community games aren't out there and it doesn't mean there's not going to be a lot of them at the day of release.

19:42.000 --> 19:51.000
We have the author of one of them on the program tonight, Aaron Teplitzki, who made Snake 360, is going to be joining us in part B of our show tonight,

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
to talk about Snake 360 and yes, it's the old school, not that snake, it's the old school Snake game from like, you know,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
like, I don't know if we're supposed to say this, but like, you know, the Nokia phones and the Snake game,

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
but it's like a whole new version of it. You won't even recognize it. Like, it's got so much more, like 50 modes and all this stuff.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
It's insanely cool. Snake360.com if you want to read up on that before he comes on the program a little later.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
There's some trailers and stuff and we'll be asking him more about the game in a little while.

20:20.000 --> 20:29.000
And also, very interesting connection between this game and music games that we've talked about in the past.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
And we'll talk about that a little later. Meanwhile, that's really it for housekeeping.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Otherwise, I'm just going to say, hey, join us on Facebook at OL Army, join us on MySpace,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio, and join us on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge, and Twitter at OLR.

20:43.000 --> 20:50.000
And this week, I will not ignore the pre-OLR Twit like I did last week, and I apologize for that.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
I will read your Twits tonight when we get to that story on Samba de Amigo, but we're not ready for that yet.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
We're going to get some other stories first, and Loki is going to start us off tonight.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
That's right. It should be called Show Us Your Twits.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
I like that. I think that should be the official name of the song. You like that, Dark Soccer? I like that.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Sure. Show us your Twits.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Very good, Loki. Quite clever tonight.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
Anyways, so kind of going into what we were just talking about, disappointment in Nintendo.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Wii Music has definitely been disappointing for Nintendo.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
It's actually only sold so far, not even 100,000 units.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
Only 81,000 units according to the NPD, or according to Nintendo, 65,000 to 66,000 units.

21:37.000 --> 21:48.000
I don't know. I can see why, because the game itself, really there's no point to it.

21:48.000 --> 21:56.000
I mean, it's a toy. Something that could have been literally downloaded on their WiiWare service, which it probably should have been.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
Jamie, you were the lone holdout for Wii Music on this program. Did you get a chance to check it out yet?

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
No. That's alright. Because I've had school. I was just curious. Honestly, better games to play.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
So, finally you're admitting it. There are better things out there.

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
No, I admitted it from the beginning that there were better things to play. I just, you know, said that I liked it. I thought it was cute.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
My inner musician sang out and went, cool, I did this crap in music theory.

22:26.000 --> 22:34.000
I say it's great, too, for 10-year-olds. But, anyway, I don't think a 10-year-old would even want to play this.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
I'm sorry. This is for like 5-year-olds. It's for kids that shake around shit and that don't know what they're doing.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
In a game, they're like, oh my goodness, I'm making music. But, hey, you know what? That's cool.

22:46.000 --> 22:55.000
Because sometimes, you know, the parents want to go talk and have adult conversations, whereas the little kids are screaming and being annoying and, you know, put them in front of this and they'll shut up.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
Now, is the numbers here skewed a little bit because this game came out late in the month? I mean, it really doesn't-

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I think so.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
To be honest, 81,000 doesn't sound like a bad number to me. I mean, maybe it's under expectations, but you consider-

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Well, this is a number-

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
There's been other music games out there, like, probably BeatMania didn't sell that much, sadly.

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
Well, this was released, this is basically one week worth of sales, because this was released in the second to last week of the month.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
But, to be honest, from what I've seen, it's not selling very well at all.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Interesting.

23:27.000 --> 23:40.000
So, it's just- I don't know. I think people- once again, they're trying to find games that the people that buy the Wii system for Wii Sports would possibly buy.

23:40.000 --> 23:48.000
That is really their challenge right now, is what can we do to get people to buy games that really don't want to buy other games other than Wii Sports?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Wii Lacrosse.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Well, the first-

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Wii Sports 2.

23:51.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah, seriously. That is what they've come up with, is Wii Sports Resort. It's more Wii Sports. Awesome! It's what you've always wanted.

24:01.000 --> 24:09.000
But, Wii Music was another thing that was supposed to be similar to that, where, you know, hey, look at that, the whole family can play music, and it's fun for the whole family.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
And then, the parents are like, well, Wii Sports is fun for the whole family, and I'm not really bored with that yet.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
Funny point from YYR in chat, Wii Music has sold more copies than Rock Revolution, in fact.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
We won't go there with Rock Revolution.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
That's a whole other can of worms. Let's move on, shall we?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Folks are kicking Nintendo while they're down, apparently.

24:32.000 --> 24:41.000
Motiva is an Ohio-based company, and they've, of course, filed a lawsuit, yet another one, against Nintendo, saying that the Wiimote is violating their patent.

24:41.000 --> 24:55.000
They filed it in 2004, technology used to create a human movement measurement system that will use a handheld tracking device in communication with a base station that is then used to create an interactive gaming experience, among other capabilities.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
Now, here's what I want to know. Is Nintendo's getting sued by all these people that claim they have the patent for, like, the Wii Remote and stuff?

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
How can everybody have the patent for the Wii Remote? Because there's all these people that are suing them, saying that they have patents for this stuff.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
Shouldn't they be suing each other because now they have patents that also kind of overlap? It's weird.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, that's the part I don't really get, either.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah, right. All these people are claiming we invented the Wii years ago.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
Well, we invented the Wii Remote. Well, no, we just paid a settlement to this other company and said they invented the Wii Remote.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
You need to dish it out with them, then, because they're the ones that actually claim that...

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I am Spartacus. No, I am Spartacus.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
No, I am Spartacus. Yeah, it's just really ridiculous.

25:36.000 --> 25:45.000
And it's also, it's like, oh my god, we didn't realize they were so similar two years after it came out.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
I'd be really curious to see what happens with one of these lawsuits, because we keep hearing about, oh, somebody's suing them, somebody's suing them,

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
yet we haven't heard about, really, anybody winning or losing yet.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, it's basically, it's like, yeah, we created the Wii Remote, we want you to pay up.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
Well, I think we created the Wii Remote, and all these hundreds of thousands of dollars say we did.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Okay, yes, you created the Wii Remote. Thank you very much.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
You know, it's interesting, though, but in kind of like the reverse news, I was reading something interesting this week that was talking about,

26:16.000 --> 26:24.000
I don't remember who it was, I think it was TiVo or somebody, was saying that if they need to incorporate Nintendo Wii technology into televisions,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
things that people do on their TVs.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
They're going to basically incorporate the design of the remote so that instead of having, you know, 50 billion buttons or whatever,

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
it's going to be motion sensitive and you're going to point at stuff on the screen.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Nintendo will sue.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Yes, we called TiVo for comment, and this is what they had to say.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
No, it's funny, TiVo will-

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I was telling a joke!

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Sorry.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I have to reset that joke now, excuse me.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Well, in Soviet Russia, joke telling.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
We called TiVo this week to get a comment on this story, and you know what they told us?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I am Spartacus.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Okay, well, I don't feel bad now for interrupting that joke.

27:02.000 --> 27:12.000
No, I was going to see what's going to be an interesting turn of events when TiVo sues Nintendo over the technology for a pointer and, you know, that kind of an error face.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
We'll see. We'll see. It's just lawsuit after lawsuit in the world. Can't we all just get along?

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
No, it's not allowed to. Don't you know that war is the true way of things?

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Actually, it's not, but still.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
War is population control.

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
So, Nintendo is being sneaky. Very, very sneaky.

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
And their sneakiness will definitely fool a few people, but they haven't said anything about it efficiently-

27:42.000 --> 27:51.000
Officially. Nor have they actually, you know, put any kind of thing on their site, from what I understand.

27:51.000 --> 28:02.000
So, it was actually seen at Target. It's official. It is a multiplayer control set, is what it's called.

28:02.000 --> 28:13.000
There is a Mario Kart wheel, Wii Remote, and Nunchuck, and it's $74.99, which is actually more expensive than getting them all individually.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
That's awesome.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
That's sweet.

28:18.000 --> 28:28.000
Two cents more, according to Kotaku, but at the same time, it's like, okay, why? Why do you even need the damn wheel?

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
Actually, no. I think that's more than that, because I think the wheel itself is only $10, although some people charge $15 for it.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Depends on where you go, but I think they're going over official retail price.

28:38.000 --> 28:46.000
Well, officially, it's supposed to be $10, so it's actually $5 more expensive than buying them separately, I think.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
In fact, I will- well, I don't know why I'm looking at GameStop's website, but I think they have theirs for $15.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
I know we sell them for $10, but that's just funny.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
But, yeah, another kind of holiday gift thing. I mean, you really don't need the Wii Wheel, but I guess people have trouble-

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
Oh, no! We have to have the Wii Wheel, or we don't have the proper grip on the thingy!

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Yeah, the Wii Wheel sells for $14.99. I thought it was supposed to be $10.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
I know that I've seen two different SRPs from them, and one was $14.99, and one was $10.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
But, I think they're supposed to be $10, but people still charge $15, because guess what?

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
People don't know better, and they will buy it for $15.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
That's because people are dumbasses.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
Okay, I have to admit something. Through the magic radio, you may not have even known I was gone, but I had to run in the house.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
I've had a migraine, and I don't remember if I said that at the top of the show, so I was making myself some coffee so I could have some caffeine, because that's good for headaches.

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
What the hell is so damn funny? I heard you literally laughing all the way in the house.

29:49.000 --> 29:57.000
That their combo, that their bundle here with one remote nunchuck and a Wii Wheel is actually more expensive than buying them all separately.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
That is pretty funny.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I have a bagel.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
So, I also ran in to get Jamie a bagel.

30:05.000 --> 30:15.000
And really, why should you buy this in a big old bundle like this, when I'm sure right next to all of them are the individual components separate of each other?

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
It's just stupid, but whatever. Can't hurt them for trying.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm sure that's probably one of those Target exclusive sets or something like that.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
I didn't say anything on the box. It's official Nintendo stuff.

30:28.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh yeah, but sometimes I know with Activision they make special bundles for Guitar Hero and stuff like that for different retailers.

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
And it won't say a Target exclusive or whatever, but it's made exclusively for those retailers.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Oh my god, the room smells like caffeine.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Sorry.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
No, it's good.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Sorry. You want some? Well, I can have some more.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
No, I gotta be up at work at six in the morning.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
I know. Now I'm never gonna be able to go to sleep tonight. That's okay, I can stay up and play. Wow.

30:56.000 --> 31:10.000
Well, speaking of innovation, Nintendo has revealed their 2009 lineup, or early 2009 basically for the first quarter, I should say, of the year for Japan.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
And here's what we can probably expect over here sometime soon after that.

31:17.000 --> 31:26.000
They've got a few things that they've already teased at Tokyo Game Show. Mario & Luigi RPG 3 is scheduled to come out February 11th to the DS.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Okay, now there's a good game. Yes, that's a cool game.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Castlevania Judgment, they're getting it a little bit late.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
And Play for Wii Mario Tennis coming January 15th.

31:39.000 --> 31:47.000
That Play for Wii Tennis, or Play for Wii Mario Tennis is the port of the GameCube game with Wii controls now.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time will be coming to both DS and Wii on January 29th.

31:55.000 --> 32:03.000
And also not listed on there would be Sin and Punishment 2 and Punch Out.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
But maybe soon after that?

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
I'm assuming. Sin and Punishment was originally a Japanese game, so it's kind of weird they're not getting it first.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, it's just not listed on the first, you know, they list only a few months at a time, so obviously it's after that.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
Quel Tipo gives a nice, mature summary of the 2009 lineup for Nintendo.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Yay Mario & Luigi, fart to everything else.

32:26.000 --> 32:33.000
I don't know, Punch Out might be kind of cool, even if they're just capitalizing on Wii Sports, the boxing game.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
You know, I didn't realize Punch Out had been re-released so many times.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
Like, they've had different versions for the Super Nintendo and stuff like that.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
The Super Nintendo one was awesome! It was kind of underrated.

32:43.000 --> 32:53.000
It might be pretty neat, but, you know, I don't have much faith in Nintendo just because of the example of the products that have come out recently.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
It's just, it doesn't seem like they're trying.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Well, Sin and Punishment might be pretty cool, because the first one was fun.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
Punishment looks awesome, but it, you know, it just doesn't look like they're trying.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
Like, the stuff that's developed in-house just doesn't seem to be that good.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Alright, well, then maybe they'll have to leave it to some of the third party.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
And one of those third parties teasing a project this week is Squeenix, Square Enix.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Blood of Bahamut is a project that they were teasing this week.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
They had a weird countdown thingy on their website.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
And, finally, it appears it's been confirmed in a magazine, Shonen Jump, in Japan.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Blood of Bahamut is the game that they're teasing.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Shonen Jump is a manga compilation.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Oh, okay. How much did they talk about video games in there?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
There's ads for stuff and little articles in there.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Well, for whatever reason, this game got the jump on Blood of Bahamut, which is the game that Squeenix is teasing.

33:43.000 --> 33:51.000
It's a DS game, and apparently what you do, you can play this game with four people locally, and you defend your city from attacks.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
So it's like a city defense game.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
Apparently, though, you, like, build them on a creature or something?

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
At least that's what the teaser image kind of makes it look like.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
So there'll be more information from this game soon.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
That's where Bahamut comes into things.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
I'm assuming.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
We'll be hearing more on this game soon, but who knows if it's coming to the US or not.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
I would assume it is, because Squeenix has gotten a little better about their whole universal game, you know, worldwide game thing.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
Especially if Last Remnants any indication, which, god damn, there's another game I gotta play this holiday season.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Oh, yeah.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It's like SimCity of the Colossus.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
So there you go. I'm sure there's a lot of Squeenix fans who are gonna be curious to check this one out.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
But yet again, another kind of interesting game for the DS.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Why is the DS getting all the love?

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
I guess it's because more people own DS's than anything else, but...

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
I don't know.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
You know, it's just like I was saying last week when I was talking about Order of Aclasia.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Why can't we have these games on consoles?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I wanna play them on my television.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Not when I'm lying in my bed playing my DS.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
They should make a DS TV tuner.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Yes and no.

34:56.000 --> 35:06.000
Like, I think the idea is cool in theory, but at the same time I want them to, you know, have like a platformer like the type of thing you'd see on the DS.

35:06.000 --> 35:13.000
But with that LittleBigPlanet style graphics, you know, really sharp, good looking, you know, use the high end graphics.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
They already have a TV tuner for the DS in Japan.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
And they also have it if you review games and you're, you know, putting together professional stuff.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But the rest of us?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah, if we have a DS dev kit.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Huh. Exactly.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Like we'd ever get one of those.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
You know what? It could happen.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
You never know. It would never happen.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
So, well, let's move on and talk about some release dates and some of the games we will be getting our hands on a little bit sooner.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
We'll start with our friends over in Europe, right, Jamie?

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
Exactly. For our UK releases. And this is stuff that we may or may not get our hands on.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
But yeah.

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
On the 18th is, excuse me, is Evercrack 2 The Shadow Odyssey.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
Spore creepy and cute parts pack. Try saying that three times fast.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Shit. Lord of the Rings Online, Mines of Moria.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
19th new Xbox experience.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
20th Last Remnant.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
21st is a whole shitload of stuff.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You ready?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Sure. Which is not a surprise, by the way.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Even though they don't have Thanksgiving over in Europe, it's still the same busy period it is here.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
There's Cubello.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Orbeant.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
My Dog Coach, Understand Your Dog with Cesar Millan.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Is that how he becomes his last name? Yeah.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
Wait, that's the dog whisperer game, isn't it? Oh god.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
Need for Speed Undercover on Damn Near Everything.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Neverwinter Nights 2, Storm of Zaheer.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Pokemon Ranger, Shadows of Almia.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
Rise of the Argonauts, also on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Skate It on Wii.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Tomb Raider Underworld on Damn Near Everything Else.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Alright, busy week. Busy, busy week.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Yarp.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Yes, and it's very similar to that in the US as well.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
So, starting things off here, we've got, well, for today,

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
Shaun White Snowboarding came out on pretty much everything.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
Also, Animal Crossing on the Wii finally made its way out this week.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And then later in the week, we've got some pretty cool stuff.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Need for Speed Undercover coming out on practically everything.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Left 4 Dead coming out on the 360.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
And I think also on the PC on that.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
And then Tech Mobile Kick Off coming to DS.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Gallop and Ride on the Wii.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
You're in the movies coming on Xbox 360.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
Actually, kind of interested in this. It might be a fun party game.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
And that's included with the Xbox Vision camera,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
which hopefully will be used for more than just this game.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
Hello Kitty Big City Dreams coming out on DS.

38:11.000 --> 38:18.000
Lord of the Rings Online Mines of Moria, the expansion pack there.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Can I interrupt with a funny chat?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
That's funnier than my Spartacus joke from earlier.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Black Wolf says,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Loki, you just misspoke.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
You stated that Animal Crossing was a new game that came out on the Wii this week.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake. Please correct yourself.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
Animal Crossing Wild World, I mean City Folk.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
The game that you may have seen in other systems now is being printed for the Wii.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Yes.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
The first game in the Let's Make GameCube Games for the Wii game has come out this week,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
and it's called Animal Crossing City Folk.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Oh, no. That's not the first game either.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
No. Must I remind you of Resident Evil 4?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Alright, alright. You're right, you're right.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
And countless other games.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Moving on.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Merv Griffin's Crosswords for the Wii.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah, that's going to be awesome.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Whoopty shit.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Exactly.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
Tomb Raider Underworld coming out on the DS, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
Skate City Heroes coming out on the Wii.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Ultimate Band on Wii and DS.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Cooking Mama, World Kitchen on the Wii.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Hopefully less broken than the last one.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Spore comic book creator for PC.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Man, let's whore Spore some more.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
That kind of rhymed.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
That was cool. You should say it again.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Man, let's whore Spore some more.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Woohoo!

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
Disney's Bolt coming out on practically everything.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Castlevania Judgment, don't buy that game ever!

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Coming out on the Wii.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Just like with Rock Revolution, I don't know what it is that draws me to these games

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
that really get shit on by the public, but I'm fucking curious about it.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Like, I want to buy it just to kind of check it out.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
They want you to make your judgment on it and judge with your wallet and do not buy it.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
Or if you are planning on buying it, wait a few weeks for it to really suck

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
and then to drop the price on it.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Find it used?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Yes.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Maybe I can find Rock Revolution used now.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
It's probably getting cheaper, I can only imagine.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
Petz Monkey House, now you have monkeys infesting your DS.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Hopefully you won't-

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Actually, that sounds kind of awesome.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
Hopefully you won't catch the deadly Mutaba virus.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
MF Bowling World Lanes for the Wii.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Dynasty Warriors 6 coming out on the Playstation 2.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Yes, it's only like nine months late.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
Rune Factory 2, a fantasy Harvest Moon on DS.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
Neverwinter Nights 2, Storm of Zere.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I think that's another expansion there.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
NPPL, it sounds like nipple.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Championship Paintball 2009.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
There's a game called Nipple?

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
It's NPPL, National Paintball Players League.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Nipple's the game!

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
Yes, we watched your- show us your Twits on Nipple.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Agatha Christie's Evil Under the-

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
It would probably sell more than Rock Revolution based on name alone.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
You know, to be honest, the game looks like-

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I'm doing the game of Nipple, who cares?

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It's Nipple's!

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun on Wii.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Cradle of Rome on DS.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
Supposedly this week is that 160GB Playstation 3 bundle now with Uncharted Drake's Fortune.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
Yes, the game that everyone forgot about and is over a year old now, awesome.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Sonic Unleashed on PS2 and Wii.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
The 360 and PS3 both got delayed, awesome.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Petz Rescue Endangered Paradise.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
Parakeet Revolution American Idol 2 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Oh, guess what? Rock Revolution with the drum kit's finally coming out, only a month late.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
And that'll be on PS3 and Xbox 360, but really, why even bother?

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
And Tony Hawk's Motion on DS.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
Yay, Tony Hawk. Those don't suck anymore.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
Imagine Movie Star on DS. Don't even bother with that one.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
God, there's too much shit coming out.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
It's the busiest week of the year.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Gothic 3, Forsaking Gods on PC.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
Rayman's Raving Rabbids TV Party coming out on Wii and DS.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Petz Crazy Monkey's on the Wii.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
Which, by the way, Loki played it at PAX on stage in front of everyone. Comedy.

42:33.000 --> 42:40.000
Yes, I wanted to play the actual part where you can slide around on the moose using the Wii balance board.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
And you sit on it and lean back and forth.

42:42.000 --> 42:50.000
Oh, yeah, sure, you can play that after you play this dancing game with some chicks with the frag dolls.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Oh, and we're gonna videotape you.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
Oh, and then when you're done, we're gonna say, fuck off, and you're not gonna get to play the actual thing you wanted to play.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
You know what was great about that whole thing?

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
Is that you were there to play something else that was being horribly ignored by everybody.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
And you were really excited to check out a different game at the booth, right?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
I don't remember what it was.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I wanted to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids because...

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
But there's something else in the booth that you went over there first to go play.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
It was at PAX.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
Yeah, I think that's what it was. And then a cute girl came up and was like, hi, you wanna play Rayman's Raving Rabbids?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
No, I asked...

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
I wanted to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids because that's individuals thing I wanted to do when I got there.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
But I didn't wanna play the dance game. Like, I wanna play that one.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
I've done the dance game of the other one and it was, guess what, not much different than this one.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.320

coming out in Japan there's a game on the Xbox 360 called odomedius gorgeous

45:49.280 --> 45:53.280
which looks pretty hot and I'd like to know where the hell this game is that is

45:53.280 --> 45:57.360
an arcade game from Konami it's like an army game it's like proteus but it's

45:57.360 --> 46:01.800
it's bigger shooter with hot chicks and the shooter actually looks kind of

46:01.800 --> 46:05.880
graphically pretty pretty fun it kind of looks like you and squatter to me a

46:05.880 --> 46:10.280
little bit is it on we said no is on Xbox 3 yes I thought of all things so

46:10.280 --> 46:13.640
this game looks pretty hot that's coming out this week in Japan also coming out

46:13.640 --> 46:17.280
the last remnant is coming out in Japan this week and it's also coming out in a

46:17.280 --> 46:21.560
bundle style thing so keep an eye out for that because they're hoping to sell

46:21.560 --> 46:27.000
some systems with that by the way odomedius gorgeous is also coming out

46:27.000 --> 46:30.320
with a special I guess like joystick or something from Konami this weekend like

46:30.320 --> 46:34.200
a bar pacts as well so it's gonna be pretty hot and I'd like to know if we're

46:34.200 --> 46:36.960

46:36.960 --> 46:42.680

46:42.680 --> 46:47.920

oh comes out this week and I have no idea what the hell this game is about it

47:31.760 --> 47:34.760
looks like it's some type of board game translation that's coming out in Japan

47:34.760 --> 47:37.600
kind of like I guess you could say a Mario Party ish game but it looks like

47:37.600 --> 47:43.360
there's some like RPG elements in that game doesn't look half bad though coming

47:43.360 --> 47:47.280
out on the handheld systems are actually let's take a look quick at PlayStation 2

47:47.280 --> 47:50.520

47:50.520 --> 47:55.360
to world in flames as well as the game called koi haime musou comes out as well

47:55.360 --> 48:02.200
from yeti that's he me my bad remember that's part of the reason why I do this

48:02.200 --> 48:07.480
because I butcher all the Japanese names oh goody another princess game hey

48:07.480 --> 48:10.960
this is probably the game that most folks are waiting for not just in Japan

48:10.960 --> 48:15.680
but in the US on the Nintendo DS this week chrono trigger finally hits on

48:15.680 --> 48:19.980

48:19.980 --> 48:25.320
accessories from Hori new pouches in different colors a new little cleaning

48:25.320 --> 48:33.920
cloth thing as well as a couple other games Tomika hero rescue force touch and

48:33.920 --> 48:40.240

48:40.240 --> 48:47.160
Nintendo DS and lastly over on the PSP checking out what releases we have there

48:47.160 --> 48:50.520
this week it's not quite as busy of a week in Japan as is in other parts of

48:50.520 --> 48:56.840
the world ratchet and clankers they call it clank and ratchet Maru he mission

48:56.840 --> 49:01.360
ignition comes out on the PSP this week as well as again Hori is also putting

49:01.360 --> 49:06.480
out some cases and things for the Sony PSP otherwise you have all-star yak you

49:06.480 --> 49:13.080
can to portable and wait for it mobile suit Gundam that's right another mobile

49:13.080 --> 49:17.400
suit Gundam game Gundam vs. Gundam and it even comes with its own PSP pack if

49:17.400 --> 49:21.780
you want to check that out so like a Gundam remake of spy vs. spy no my

49:21.780 --> 49:26.280
friend calls it Gundam also I think this is kind of neat I think it's like a

49:26.280 --> 49:31.440
Disgaea spin-off because a game has come out all about prettys yes this week on

49:31.440 --> 49:37.840
the PSP pretty or a guy shoe jinkoo day any suka comes out this week I think you

49:37.840 --> 49:41.800
can be a hero too or something like that it's it's coming out in the u.s. to in

49:41.800 --> 49:48.200
February you get 1,000 lives in this game that's it's a side-scroller action

49:48.200 --> 49:52.120
game and your character has literally 1,000 lives I hope it's really hard

49:52.120 --> 49:56.200
because I'd be funny it must be but you know prettys were kind of disposable

49:56.200 --> 49:58.680
and Disgaea so that is kind of funny that actually sounds like kind of a

49:58.680 --> 50:03.400
funny game so I might have to check that one out all right that's gonna do it for

50:03.400 --> 50:07.400
Japanese releases this week I hope that I hope that game gets supported for the

50:07.400 --> 50:12.120
u.s. that's like it does that's all three games you wary okay I was just saying

50:12.120 --> 50:16.000
my bad but that's like three games I've talked about they're coming out in Japan

50:16.000 --> 50:21.360
that I would love to see come out in the u.s. so game challenge which I forget

50:21.360 --> 50:25.640
what it's called like something God I remember the Japanese version of it it's

50:25.640 --> 50:30.960
like Game Center CX or something like that in Japan but the retro game

50:30.960 --> 50:37.120
challenges coming here it's a bunch of fake retro games and I think it's a

50:37.120 --> 50:41.120
little bit like Warioware all right let's move on with some other gaming

50:41.120 --> 50:45.720
news well this is particularly exciting stuff speaking of other release dates

50:45.720 --> 50:52.000
Street Fighter 4 has a date for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 actually

50:52.000 --> 50:59.160
you're saying that it's going to be February 20th 2009 so there's also some

50:59.160 --> 51:04.120
reports saying that there's going to be 25 characters in the console release and

51:04.120 --> 51:07.120
maybe some other fun stuff so who knows

51:07.120 --> 51:13.600
cool and I'm looking forward to playing Street Fighter 4 very much oh and

51:13.600 --> 51:16.640
there's actually though there's a mention of the PC version but no really

51:16.640 --> 51:22.440
state for that yeah and while it's coming out in Europe on February 20th we

51:22.440 --> 51:27.400
will be getting it in the u.s. three days earlier on February 17th then we'll be

51:27.400 --> 51:32.280
also coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well and we'll feature

51:32.280 --> 51:39.600
actually I think some console exclusive characters including Sakura yay wasn't

51:39.600 --> 51:42.400
there something about this game is actually not gonna be coming to arcades

51:42.400 --> 51:46.880
though over here which is kind of sad I don't think it is according I don't know

51:46.880 --> 51:49.840
why they wouldn't bring it over here it'd be awesome you know what we just

51:49.840 --> 51:53.020
hate arcades you know what you know what we're gonna see it at Sunnyvale

51:53.020 --> 51:58.760
golf land you know we're gonna I'm sure we're gonna see it yeah well it is

51:58.760 --> 52:02.320
popping up around the u.s. I mean folks are importing and I know I I think some

52:02.320 --> 52:04.680
of our New York listeners called in several weeks ago to talk about it but

52:04.680 --> 52:07.640
you know it's just kind of sad it's not getting an official quote-unquote

52:07.640 --> 52:11.160
release in the u.s. okay so it wasn't really stopped a lot of people nowadays

52:11.160 --> 52:14.640
maybe because it's coming out on the consoles and when games come out on

52:14.640 --> 52:18.760
consoles it kind of kills the arcade release unless it's you know during the

52:18.760 --> 52:24.600
owners club or DDR you can do it right I mean if developers are smart enough to

52:24.600 --> 52:28.840
incorporate things that you can tie into consoles like for example DDR with edit

52:28.840 --> 52:34.760
data or you know f0 GX with you know data that you can port to the arcade

52:34.760 --> 52:41.800
and that kind of stuff I think if they do it smart both can benefit from it all

52:41.800 --> 52:45.520
right well hey Street Fighter fans if you are a hardcore Street Fighter fan

52:45.520 --> 52:48.600
you gotta be really hardcore Street Fighter fan to appreciate this or if you

52:48.600 --> 52:52.200
just like bad movies like me you're gonna be excited that Street Fighter the

52:52.200 --> 52:56.840
movie is coming out on blu-ray yes that's right the Jean-Claude Van Damme

52:56.840 --> 53:02.000
Raul Julia and most importantly Kylie Minogue is cami Street Fighter movie is

53:02.000 --> 53:07.640
coming out on blu-ray it's an extreme edition of the Street Fighter movie and

53:07.640 --> 53:12.440
it's so sad but true that this is Raul Julia's last movie but you can

53:12.440 --> 53:14.920
experience it one more day he actually was the best thing about the movie I

53:14.920 --> 53:18.480
even remember this 20 years later you know well not quite that much but like

53:18.480 --> 53:21.200
15 20 years later but he was the best thing about that movie and the rest of

53:21.200 --> 53:24.800
it was complete cheese ball me was great really that's true Kylie Minogue was

53:24.800 --> 53:27.600
pretty awesome it's pretty great to see her in the movie I think the reason that

53:27.600 --> 53:31.520
this movie's coming out now or soon I guess well the tie-in with all the other

53:31.520 --> 53:36.040
Street Fighter crap well yes and also to make it seem like that the new movie

53:36.040 --> 53:39.520
isn't as bad as it really is because you watch this movie these they'll be really

53:39.520 --> 53:43.200
holy crap that's awesome you know where is the average person see you can go

53:43.200 --> 53:53.200
yeah not great very good point it's like thank God it's not you know thank God

53:53.200 --> 53:58.120
didn't kill any good actors in this one I will say this though and not to spoil

53:58.120 --> 54:02.240
anything about the movie but the very last thing in the entire movie the

54:02.240 --> 54:06.920
little pose they all do at the very end it's by far the best part because it's

54:06.920 --> 54:12.340
so fucking cheesy good question from frisbee and chat chat on orange on

54:12.340 --> 54:16.600
radio.com can we expect Street Fighter the movie the game I don't think so

54:16.600 --> 54:20.880
considering some of the people who were in development of that game have come

54:20.880 --> 54:24.360
out and now spoken about why the game was such crap like I don't think you're

54:24.360 --> 54:26.680
ever gonna see that game again I think that's the type of thing they've kind of

54:26.680 --> 54:30.800
swept under the rug and would like to leave there so thanks for reminding them

54:30.800 --> 54:34.200
of such painful memories you want to play Street Fighter the movie the game

54:34.200 --> 54:41.000
you just need to go find maim sha 100 Matt says they are making that Street

54:41.000 --> 54:47.160
Fighter the later years into a TV show I would like to see a Street Fighter

54:47.160 --> 54:53.920
sitcom that would be pretty funny anyhow it's just wrong let's see if we have

54:53.920 --> 54:57.320
anything wrong wrong wrong in our email bag this week every week you send us

54:57.320 --> 55:01.000
emails at mailbag at orange launch radio.com and dark soccer likes to read

55:01.000 --> 55:06.040
some of the emails live on air that's just what she's gonna do this week well

55:06.040 --> 55:10.280
this week I have a surprise twist but I'll reveal that after dark soccer is

55:10.280 --> 55:17.120
done well I would do it if my email would pull out so just give me a second

55:17.120 --> 55:27.800
there we go who we have a stunning total of one email and it awesome but as a

55:27.800 --> 55:31.040
reminder that email address is mailbag at orange launch radio.com if you want

55:31.040 --> 55:35.840
to give dark dark soccer some work to do yes it yes it is so this comes from geek

55:35.840 --> 55:41.640
boy hey guys for episode 300 I sent an email and you asked how old I am my

55:41.640 --> 55:46.320
13th birthday is going to be on the 23rd yes my parents know I listen don't freak

55:46.320 --> 55:53.480
out so sacramax beat that fatality this is Jamie I'm on Twitter so please give

55:53.480 --> 55:58.120
me the JSRF soundtrack info on there and yes I know I have typed this horribly

55:58.120 --> 56:03.920
but I am too lazy to type slowly sorry this is orange lounge exclamation points

56:03.920 --> 56:12.520
a lot done all right I would just be happier if you actually used to do you

56:12.520 --> 56:16.640
spelled just like everything right so I'm not sure just using your shift key

56:16.640 --> 56:22.720
to capitalize stuff okay all right here's the twist in tonight's mailbag I

56:22.720 --> 56:27.100
got one in my personal email that asked me to read it on the air so since we

56:27.100 --> 56:30.120
only had one email I'll go ahead and read that now I don't know why they

56:30.120 --> 56:32.680
wanted me to read it instead of you but I think it's because it involves audio

56:32.680 --> 56:40.220
cues tonight so this email comes to us from Rini tonight and here's here's what

56:40.220 --> 56:45.860
it is greetings to you olr listeners but the pleasantries will end there once the

56:45.860 --> 56:51.320
following is read pyramid head is inferior that's a pretty controversial

56:51.320 --> 56:54.680
statement right there on this program pyramid head is inferior pyramid head

56:54.680 --> 56:58.360
may be near and dear to many of your hearts but I mean no ill will if anything

56:58.360 --> 57:03.320
I want to expose everyone to something more creepy and superior games with a

57:03.320 --> 57:07.360
horror theme may have their most memorable monsters and moments but I

57:07.360 --> 57:11.000
believe that there is one out there to best them all and it comes from earth

57:11.000 --> 57:15.240
bound yes the old Super Nintendo game with Ness in it before I continue I'd

57:15.240 --> 57:18.320
like to put up the old spoiler warning here since what I'm referring to is the

57:18.320 --> 57:23.040
final boss of earthbound spoiler warning at the end of earthbound Ness

57:23.040 --> 57:28.040
Ness faces Giygas an enemy that has been inhabited by by the very manifestation

57:28.040 --> 57:31.300
of evil and has become a formless swirling massive red and black as the

57:31.300 --> 57:34.760
fight progresses Giygas becomes more erratic and unsettling the fight itself

57:34.760 --> 57:38.400
is disturbing even by today's standards and it's a Super Nintendo game to boot

57:38.400 --> 57:43.000
the parallax sprite of Giygas has a fetus in it the audio in the fight is

57:43.000 --> 57:48.280
the actual boss itself and Giygas's speech is just plain creepy truly an

57:48.280 --> 57:52.800
experience in itself here's some a little clip of actually what that might

57:52.800 --> 58:05.160
look like that's actually a little creepy sound that Giygas makes that is

58:05.160 --> 58:09.880
a little bit creepy and if that wasn't bad enough consider the fact that there

58:09.880 --> 58:13.520
is complete leftover data for a potentially creepier rematch against

58:13.520 --> 58:17.360
Giygas and mother three what was found was a sequence of imagery that gets

58:17.360 --> 58:19.920
progressively disturbing as the fight would have progressed if one were to

58:19.920 --> 58:24.760
play it wouldn't you get freaked out if you are fighting the hollow red outline

58:24.760 --> 58:28.320
image of a dead relative's face with people as eyes and mouth gaping wide

58:28.320 --> 58:34.320
open right and there's audible speech for this iteration of Giygas

58:34.720 --> 58:39.160
it's kind of creepy all things considered anyhow even if you never play

58:39.160 --> 58:42.160
earthbound I implore the listeners to set aside a few minutes to watch these

58:42.160 --> 58:49.240
amazingly failed frightening experiences GIY GAS search for earth bounds Giygas

58:49.240 --> 58:57.880
final battle and Lucas nightmare on YouTube greeny so there you have it dude

58:57.880 --> 59:04.920
this thing is sick I like it but I like pyramid head better and that guy just

59:04.920 --> 59:09.240
just doesn't rape things that's that's the difference no I don't know I mean

59:09.240 --> 59:13.000
there's a guy guess in the next Smash Brothers game there you go there you go

59:13.000 --> 59:16.960
that's what I'm talking about I want a horror all-stars game there you go we'll

59:16.960 --> 59:20.360
put them in Smash Brothers and then they'll piss fans off even more because

59:20.360 --> 59:23.520
yet another character from earthbound and they're not bring it over here ha

59:23.520 --> 59:28.720
ha don't do it's like what they did with Kid Icarus all right anyhow that's gonna

59:28.720 --> 59:31.800
do it for tonight's mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com if you want to

59:31.800 --> 59:34.840
send us more emails it's like oh you want a Kid Icarus game did you well

59:34.840 --> 59:44.920
once coming someday maybe so Activision you know since they are gonna be playing

59:44.920 --> 59:49.480
on making a lot of Guitar Hero games need some more developers to help them

59:49.480 --> 59:56.860
with that so they have acquired Budcat to do that and Budcat Creations the

59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.920
student has been responsible for all Guitar Hero titles on PlayStation 2

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:06.760
since Guitar Hero 3 is currently in development of a new game in the Guitar

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:16.560
Hero franchise and one guess would be that it's Guitar Hero Matalka hmm and

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.440
says with Neversoft at the helm Budcat is working on PS2 and Vicarious Visions

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.960
will be responsible for the Wii and DS versions of whatever the next game will

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:35.800
be and Budcat also just worked on I guess Wii game that just came out on the

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.520
WiiWare service our house which was published by Majesco in the middle of

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:48.420
the street our house yes nevermind I don't know it's does is there really a

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.920
lot of development that needs to go into Guitar Hero Metallica I mean

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.320
apparently other than putting note charts you know together and maybe they

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.400
have to make it so uniquely different you know just like how Guitar Hero

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.920
Aerosmith was so different from Guitar Hero 3 yeah you know we do need to

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:13.400
create the exaggerated models of the Metallica band members well hey it's

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.600
interesting that Budcat is kind of being assimilated into the active Blizzard

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.680
Empire but what can you do more interesting stuff coming out for Guitar

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.280
Hero an official Gene Simmons brand axe guitar coming out for not just Guitar

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.640
Hero but Rock Band as well sweet it's a wireless guitar it looks like a

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.760
freaking axe not the deodorant or I'm talking about like like I'm gonna chop

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.960
you in half type type axe which actually looks pretty fucking sweet it's coming

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.520
out November 15th for 80 bucks or actually my money on that that date just

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.280
passed so it's already out now it's coming out for $80 it is compatible with

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.360
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 versions of Guitar Hero and Rock Band the little

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.920
controller actually will work with both it uses a little dongle to get the

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.200
signal there apparently the actual guitar is like a three-quarter size

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.080
official replica of the official Gene Simmons axe guitar now unfortunately

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.360
this guitar will only work for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 if you

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.680
are an Xbox 360 owner you have to wait until April of 2009 if you're a Wii

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.580
owner January 31st is when you get your version of the guitar so I don't know

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:26.720
why Xbox 360 owners have to wait so much longer but there you go whatever they

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.000
got like what the Mad Catz bass guitar well as if there wasn't a million

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.040
different guitars out there already right but I have to admit yes one does

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.680
look pretty freaking sweet and I do need a new guitar but I play the games on the

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.840
Xbox 360 so I'll tell you what Rob the speaking of guitars this has nothing to

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:51.400
do with it okay I'm gonna throw that ferret in a fireplace yeah you say that

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.760
you think have you know the ferret is undefeatable you know what's funny is

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.600
that in Wii music you have all these obscure things right you have

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.480
cheerleaders triangles cowbell right all that stuff why don't we have ferret in

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.080
Wii music that might have made the game sell more copies think about it that

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.480
would be the OLR edition of Wii music think about it all right moving on but

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:17.680
now um samba de amigo see I say samba de amigo and everyone's like Navy SEALs

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:24.080
anyway um samba de amigo is going to be on mobile phones it will actually be

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.200
with a t-mobile and AT&T phones which pretty much spells out iPhone for me

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:37.640
since I think it's t-mobile t-mobile has the iPhone now too right or was it no

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.800
well I don't know in other countries they do but not here yeah um but also

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.880
will t-mobile has their sidekick too so basically those nice big screens but

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.080
samba de amigo is going to be coming up for t-mobile and AT&T phones um that's

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:58.400
gonna be pretty cool it's I mean basically just samba de amigo but

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:05.320
you're not going to really have it being all fun and maraca II you I think you

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:11.960
just shake the phone I was gonna say I mean how much can you really reciprocate

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.680
the experience of samba de amigo on a friggin cell phone that's what I don't

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.840
get you know it's a little silly to me well I might have to try it but that's

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:27.760
just to see exactly how it works so who knows there's I don't see any kind of a

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.760
date on it or anything yet but just keep looking if you care maybe I don't care

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:41.160
yikes you're right over that's you that was how little I cared all right well we

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.340

inappropriate let's see toe okay here we go here we go line about big titties in

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.320

tyrant says could be fun for a few minutes on the iPhone I don't see it

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.040
being really worth it though music games generally suck on mobile dark Tetsuya

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.580
says even if I were to into mobile gaming probably not half the gameplay is

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.400
shaking the maracas you don't get that on a mobile deke man says after the Wii

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.840
versions crappy controls and no support on the console release I'm not expecting

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.040
anything Sega does to be good anymore misty olr says hell I'll probably check

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.920
it out of Verizon decides to make it work on my phone act-def says somebody

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.440
amigo without maracas ain't somebody amigo gs68 says I don't play mobile

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.040
games I have a DS and a PSP maren marvel says probably not I think it would be

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.280
hard to emulate a game like that and make it as fun as the original in a

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.680
mobile phone version well unless was on the iPhone maybe still probably not

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.480
crows says you mobile games dim fancy cell phones were made for phone calls

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.680
nothing else for gaming they're probably even weaker than Game Boy Advance well

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.760
tempo says sure why not take a game beloved for its peripherals and put it

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:54.320
out on mobile phones what's next steel battalion and lastly geek boy says I

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.400
never had the chance to play the original because I was too young but I

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.520
wouldn't buy this in case I ever do get the chance to I don't want to ruin the

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.200

right all right let's move on gaming news do we gotta yes and because we're

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.880
almost to the classic game of the week dark soccer all right I know and we and

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.960
we have an interview tonight Aaron from seeing 360 I know it's a busy show

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.880
tonight we got to keep it moving oh yeah guitar here a world tour and rock band

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:46.080
are both getting brand new songs from the new killers album day and age and

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:52.080
it's originally thought to only be debuting on guitar world tour but of

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.360
course you know the MTV came out to say hey that's not true so there's going to

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.960
be a three song track pack available day and date with the new album and it will

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:09.560
be available for looks like a guitar here a world tour for 440 Microsoft

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.920
points or 549 on the PlayStation 3 also each song will be available individually

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:21.520
for 160 Microsoft points dollar 99 on ps3 and actually on the Nintendo Wii for

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:29.920
200 points a pop and then for rock bands be released I guess alongside with the

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:35.920
thing as well and no word on price or if they're gonna just be doing like a three

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:44.160
song pack that says looks like they're gonna feature yeah looks like it also

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.360
might be the same oh three different songs from there so whereas guitar here

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:54.840
world tour had human losing touch or human and losing touch rock band twos

01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.920
got mr. right side alongside with smile like you mean it and I guess both of them

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:06.080
get day and age the killers are pretty cool I approve that's one of the songs I

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.640
really like to sing and sing star which by the way is sing star is kind of an

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.700
underrated karaoke game it really is does add to the party atmosphere to have

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.120
the original videos playing in the background I got to say all things

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.560
considered the sing store I know I'm like totally getting off track but I

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.920
don't care the sing store works pretty well that I actually did play that game

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.520
a little bit this week we actually downloaded some of the stuff from sing

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.520
store Paula Abdul opposites attract with the video and it's actually a duet and

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:36.760
you can choose to sing Paulus part or MC scat cat awesome just want to say that

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.000
even though it has nothing to do with the killers but it made me think of that

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.640
anyhow back to rock band and guitar hero some other download stuff coming out

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.080
very soon rock band is going to be getting the dead Kennedy's a three-pack

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:54.320
of dead Kennedy's California uber ales owls not allies but owls holiday in

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.720
Cambodia you know that song police truck coming out in a three-pack mission of

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.040
Burma also getting a three-pack Micah that's how I escaped my certain fate and

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.160
that's when I reached for my revolver like that song century media girls of

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.200
metal three-pack it's two songs from lacuna coil and one song from in this

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.360
moment and then one more individual song coming out this week from crooked X a

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:22.000
song called gone guitar hero not to be outdone is also releasing some songs

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.320
this week not quite as much but they did land a pretty big-name artist

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.840
Jimi Hendrix a Hendrix track pack is out this week if six was nine little wing

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:38.960
and fire live from Woodstock that's pretty hot so check those out you can

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.960
either get something modern there in a rock band or something well I guess it's

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.960
not all right modern folks you know some of those other songs were like kind of

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.080
like 80s punk but pretty pretty good diverse selection between the two games

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:54.120
this week all right also to diversify your gaming week dark soccer is here to

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.960
pick a game from the archives and dub it as her classic video game of the week

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.960
because you kids need to respect your elder games and check out a old-school

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.080
game once in a while and even though dark soccer has kind of had some newer

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.320
choices as of late like last week was what Symphony of the night you can kind

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.960
of play that on the newer consoles tonight's pick going back to the very

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:23.040
very old-school right dark soccer that it is the game of the week is wizards

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:29.000
and warriors which is the game that I play the shit ton of me too I love the

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:47.880
Wizards and Warriors let's take a listen the map I like the music that it plays

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:55.840
when you go inside one of the little rooms in the trees right here

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.520
I tell us a little more about Wizards and Warriors Wizards and Warriors you

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:06.640
play as this dude named Kuros who was wearing full plate armor unlike the box

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.960
where he's dressed up as Conan the barbarian go fig hi I'm 80s Nintendo

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:20.440
artwork and was awesome bite my big toe damn inaccurate bastards making make a

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:26.280
man look like that anyway so you start off in the forest the forest is

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.560
wonderful and beautiful and scary and deadly full of spiders and creatures and

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:37.280
thingies but you can go inside trees and the trees have doors and they make

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.960
special noise every time you open the door and you get this cool music and

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.600
suddenly the trees have like special things that you can jump on and spiders

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:51.520
to kill so um you basically are going through the game and you can get

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.120
treasure chests that like if you find the ones with gem it gems in it it says

01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.280
thou hast discovered gems or there was right there thou hast discovered dagger

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.160
of throwing just happened there I'm feeling so freaking guy playing here in

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.040
the background I remember that game this game was awesome but you can also get

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:18.840
potions and food as your healing items weapons and tools you have unlimited

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:24.160
continues and basically the only problem of dying is that your score gets reset

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:33.400
to zero so the main guy is he has a sword or an axe and a shield however in

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:38.960
the sequel you can actually choose iron sword you can actually choose to pick an

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.120
element and then go through the game like that I'm not really gonna talk too

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.160
much about the other versions because they were inferior in comparison to the

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:55.880
first one but it's like why couldn't they get him to look right on the

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.160
coverage I'm sorry for going back to that it's still bothering me dark Tetsuya

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.800
wants to point out don't forget the sequel iron sword that that box art

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:08.760
actually had Fabio on it yeah yeah awesome but that also made the game

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:15.680
slightly inferior so um but I mean really the game is very simple you just

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.840
go through all the different stages and you have to basically you have to keep

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.400
unlocking you rescuing these women throughout the level until you rescue

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:31.080
the princess I always like to think of them as wenches they were being held up

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:40.800
by ropes now the thing there is a trick with this game and the big trick with

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:47.720
this game is that if you go through the different levels and keep picking up

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.440
however many what was it I think it was the different keys you needed wasn't it

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.000
mm-hmm you can actually if you go back in into the second forest level which is

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.440
basically after you do the underground and come back up there's actually a way

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.600
to do a series of jumps to where you will jump over pretty much the screen

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:12.220
divider back into the first level of forest and you can play through the game

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.120
again and you'll actually beat the game halfway through the game because you'll

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.320
just have all the number of items you need and the princess will just be left

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.360
there going uh dude where are you so you actually don't have to fight the final

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:30.640
boss to beat the game you can just glitch the game out hardcore the bad guy

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:38.440
mal kill was also in an episode of captain and the game master freaking

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:45.600
stupid show it was in the nightmare on mother brain Street nice and the world

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.480
it in the game it was called the kingdom of Elrond in the show it was called

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.920
Excalibur for some reason can I just say something completely random I'm watching

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.200
the video of this guy playing wizards and warriors and the little beehives of

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:06.720
the bees come out of look like poop yes they do I call them shit bees nice also

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:14.080
um kuros the main guy and he was in a show called the power team and they made

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.640
him look like a man but now this is one cool thing and I wasn't quite aware of

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.840
this but what the wizards and warriors story was turned into a book called

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:28.280
worlds of power different series of novels for for young children and it was

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:34.800
about a boy named Matthew who was trying to use his imagination creatively and

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.240
instead brings his father's night figure to life and has to go help fight the

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:47.640
battle but that's just the story so anyway I love this game I hate every

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:53.800
other version after it so which is a warriors classic game of the week check

01:16:53.800 --> 01:17:03.400
it out if you happen to own in well done thou hast rescued what was her name

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.800
Lucinda the distress damsel 500 points and of conveniently she's wearing a

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:13.160
bikini who knew maybe she's a harem girl wizards and warriors classic game of the

funny joke all right anyhow let's move on we're gonna get back into some gaming

01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.000

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.960
snake from the cell phones but like like camera angles and color and multiplayer

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.800
and goals and modes galore it's it's nuts we'll talk all about it with Aaron

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.840
here very soon but first some more gaming news Loki yes the recently

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:32.000
released banjo-kazooie game nuts and bolts has a little bit of a problem if

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.960
you have an older TV or an older TV that also happens to be very small

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:42.700
apparently the in-game text is too small to see on some standard definition

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:47.600
television sets and originally rare had said that they weren't gonna fix the

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.480
problem that it would be too expensive in terms of time resources and money to

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.880
alter the company has now gone back on that word and said that they will have a

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:01.680
fix within the next 30 days which just shows goes to show you the internet

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.800
bitches enough it will get its way well it can't be that hard I mean after all

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:12.080
dead rising have the same problem and the same fix so come on guys it's just

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:18.440
like what editing a font seriously I imagine though from the developer

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:23.200
perspective getting these patches out there is got to be a pain in the ass but

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:30.640
within to be fair though all games that are published on the 360 are supposed to

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.060
go through a process where they actually test them on a standard definition 14

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:41.160
inch TV and you know the text has to be you know readable on that and it has to

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:46.640
play well look right and all that sort of stuff so the steps are in place to

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:51.760
make sure it goes out right they just ignored those steps most game testers

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:58.160
I've talked to as well get it's not like these companies buy their game testers

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.760
big expensive fancy screens to test the games on you know most of these guys

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.320
have little monitors and things I'm surprised this stuff doesn't come out in

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.400
testing maybe because they sit so close to the monitor when they're testing the

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.860
game they don't really have living rooms to sit and play the games and I have no

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.400
idea how this thing's how these this gets missed or approved you know what I

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:22.200
mean well seeing that in my memory it's only been two games really so far that

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:27.560
have had this issue I think that the precautions and the steps are in place

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.240
to make sure this doesn't happen I think that maybe they were trying to rush the

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.860
game out to the market and didn't quite have time to go back and fix said

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:42.280
problem with game until after the fact and they first they said oh let's see if

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.880
no one notices and you know sure enough people notice and they're I see if

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.080
they're fine with us not fixing it and sure enough people weren't so now they

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.680
have to do it all right well speaking of banjo-kazooie

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:59.080
Loki has been able to hook us up with this right here I'm holding in my hot

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.320
little hand on Justin TV if you guys can see that there if you're on the radio

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:07.540
you you unfortunately cannot see it but what this is this is a code for you to

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:14.800
download the original banjo-kazooie game on Xbox Live absolutely free and we're

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.360
gonna be giving that away next week on the show a popular game is coming back

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.800
that we haven't played here on the show in a long time one versus the chat room

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.440

listeners won't work out that we can give one away to you guys this week but

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.120
I promise the next contest we do will be open to all that was satisfying Rob

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.680
what hunting the channel getting up and getting away that I know there you have

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.040
it all right so stay tuned for that meantime we're gonna move on to the

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.000
PlayStation 3 and talking about little big planet man what a mess little big

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.880
planet has suddenly become you know I talked about this game last week this

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:09.040
game is awesome I still love this game but it sounds like moderation is really

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.880
starting to get a little crazy there Sony apparently has laid out some rules

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.600
this week ensure the content you share with other users is suitable for all

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.960
ages and everybody has access to your level if you publish it please respect

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.720
other people's intellectual property rights for example don't use images

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.760
brands or logos that you're not entitled to use and if you come across any

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.740
content that you feel the need to report then please do it responsibly hoax

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.920
reports will be considered inappropriate behavior well I don't know if this has

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.940
made anything better for them to come out and clarify because apparently some

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:41.680
really popular levels on little big planet have been hit including one

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.440
called as your palace which I haven't played myself but it's awesome very very

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.200
popular level one of the favorite it got hit for moderation this week if you can

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:55.480
believe it and they can't figure out why this game got hit for moderation was it

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.920
the blood splatters they had in the level that apparently were I don't know

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.840
there's and it gets worse than that actually it's not just that one many of

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.360
the top levels have been hit with moderation including the world of color

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.960
which is another one which there is nothing copyright in world of color I

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.960
don't get that as weird well the level creator of Azure

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.240
Palace is pissed he made a comment I invested a huge amount of time making

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.200
the Azure Palace to not only be original but to shift the gameplay of this

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.640
wonderful game you guys made besides similarities to underwater stages in

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.240
general there's nothing directly taken from any game movie etc if there so

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.320
happen to be one the terms of moderation are by far extremely irrational the user

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.560
is given no chance to change certain aspects of his creation to conform to

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.640
said rules about we're not even given a freaking reason as to why it happened so

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.880
needless to say whoever is pulling these levels Sony media molecule whoever I

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.000
imagine Sony whoever is pulling these levels is starting to bite the hand that

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.120
feeds them a little bit because if you piss off all the people that are

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.320
creating the great content for your game there's not gonna be much left with

01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.920
those you know win nine trophies and 32nd levels which get old fast it's

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:05.560
really sad though because lots of levels are getting moderated some you know

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.360
maybe they're kind of borderline you know there's like that Tetris level that

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.000
was sort of like Tetris but not quite that got moderated there's that level

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.800
was a lot of fun there is a bunch of other ones but there's like seriously a

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.640
ton of threads on little big workshop the official website you know for little

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:30.760
big planet and stuff and you know tons of stuff me there's a 22 page for you

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.200
know post on there that's just going you know and some of the things like some of

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:41.000
the comments there's a mini game actually in little big planet in the

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.280
frozen tundra level or a world called spline rider where you get on a thin

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.920
sled and slide around on a track hmm seems kind of familiar to a popular

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.920
online game called line rider so it's okay for a medium article to go ahead

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.120
and rip off of their games but it's not okay for other people to do that and

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.280
they actually have it's okay for them to have a strip club in the game but heaven

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.080
forbid you see a blood splatter you know those blood splatters those are actually

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.240
taken from the game they're in one of the Asian levels in there where there's

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.960
blood splatters underneath these blades that are there so it's stuff that's in

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:22.560
the game I it's just retarded game guru says this moderation will kill little

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.440
big planet in our chat room and I kind of tend to agree I mean if this is what

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.640
they're gonna do I mean again they're biting the hand that feeds them in a

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.480
game that thrives on community creation which is the best part of the game if

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.760
you keep pissing off your a-plus creators what's gonna be left there

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.520
people get this and they're thinking of they're selling their copies of the

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.120
games or they're just doing whatever things no I think it's kind of funny

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.640
remember how there's that God of War level that got moderated and kicked off

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.840
there yet there's God of War skins and level stickers that you can use to make

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.440
a God of War level that doesn't make any sense either and there's a bunch of

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.320
other stuff I mean just go through some of the threads on this forum just

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.920
absolutely random levels like someone made the rent just a race car level it's

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:12.120
a skill racer and it got taken off just like you know random stuff my there are

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:16.600
a few things I recommend if you're planning on uploading level that you can

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.640
bypass a lot of stuff or maybe make it a little bit easier on yourself one make a

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.080
copy of the level first before you upload it and upload the copy because if

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.840
your copy gets moderated then you can still make a copy of the original level

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.640
again and re upload it if you need to also if you want one good thing if you

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.680
think someone's gonna kick your level offline make it so that they can

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.720
download a copy of your level as well you can have that option on there so

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.360
someone can actually save it you know even put in your comments to make sure

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.120
you save the level when you're done you can actually save it to your moon and

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.280
then it doesn't matter if it gets moderated and if anyone from Sony or

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.040
Media Molecule happens to listen to this show because we do have some industry

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.040
people listen to this show but kind of keep quiet and they don't really let us

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.280
know they're listening if anybody from the either those companies happens to

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.520
listen to the show it is imperative you guys comment on the situation like this

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.360
week I mean you can't let this keep going on much longer it is starting to

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.000
snowball out of control it is imperative you get your legal department on the

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.720
ball and say something quick yes and the other thing too is because people are

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.400
there aren't saying anything people are thinking the worst oh is are they gonna

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.240
steal my levels and use them in a download pack or something they're

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.240
gonna charge money for oh why are they doing this you know it's just it's

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.480
ridiculous and the thing that's really ridiculous about it is say you work new

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.920
20 hours on level and upload it and stuff like that and they moderate for

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.520
some retarded reason you can't re upload it again so you can't really make a copy

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.800
of it or you know do whatever with it and I seem to remember this comparison

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.960
being made in the past but gs68 makes it again tonight see blast works has levels

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.640
with copyrighted imagery yet their staff doesn't mind that shit and nobody sued

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.560
blast works yet yeah very interesting tigerclaw says this could probably

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.080
spark a global boycott of the game if they don't fix it I don't know so much

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.800
about that because I think a lot of people that work at the games have

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.680
already all been sold a lot of times you know you know what I mean most people

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.680
that were really eager about the game already bought it yyr kind of follows up

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.800
with that global boycott will never happen it's as likely to happen as an

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:14.080
internet petition meaning something what they need to do is somehow create a

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.200
patch that allows you to swap saves and have like some third-party way to you

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.760
know swap levels or something like that well look I know if I spent 20 hours

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.800
making a level and it got moderated with no explanation I'd be pretty pissed off

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.280
so to those LBP players that have made these levels and had them rip down with

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.240
no explanation we dedicate a segment of ours tonight to you the f-use of the

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.360
week

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:54.800
dark soccer I want you to start us off tonight a few to apathetic voters as in

01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:03.560
people who don't vote I mean really there's people who complain about an

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:09.440
issue and don't vote on it because if you if it doesn't mean enough to you to

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.120
go out and make your voice heard you know at least by giving your vote to the

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:19.120
issue then you have no right to complain but like if somebody just abstains from

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.680
voting for a school board member because I don't know anything about I'm talking

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.640
about any issues yeah I'm just saying though if it if it's something that's

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:32.320
really not going to affect everything from day to day that's one thing but if

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:39.760
it's something like Oh example a civil rights issue hmm Alameda County oh I'm

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:48.320
sorry only 22% of them voted that's right lazy asses but uh just make sure

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.640
if it means something to you that instead of just bitching about it you do

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:58.480
something about it okay if you to my place of employment for still not giving

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:04.560
me a raise and for potentially making my job even harder my co-worker is quitting

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.800
here within the next couple weeks and unfortunately they're gonna probably

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.800
hire someone else to fill a spot and I'm gonna get probably some of his bigger

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.680
accounts and they're planning on giving me yet another really big account and

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:26.040
it's just more work for me to do with no sort of I don't compensation for it and

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:31.440
it kind of sucks but their mentality is you don't like it leave and

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.200
unfortunately I've been there for almost ten years and I would rather them get

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:43.240
over themselves give me a raise and waste ten years of my life I really just

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:46.720
want to give an F you tonight to Noah's bagels and their bagel dogs because

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.680
they're so delicious and I can't stop eating them especially now that you know

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.080
after the gall bladders come out my health is starting to get back to normal

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:57.320
thank God a few to those things for being so damn yummy and I know they're

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:04.160
not good for you sorry that my F you is a little more silly compared to some of

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:08.760
the others tonight but sometimes it's the little things all right anyhow let's

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:16.280
get back into some gaming news dark Sakura and the magic number is five what

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.840
magic number I'm just kidding I thought three was a magic number that's what

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:25.280
they told me on schoolhouse rock 42 oh I see well who's been looking forward to

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.000
Loco Roco to I never really got into Loco Roco one but I check it out I would

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.320
check it out Loco Roco is crack at any rate yes ma'am on the online portal for

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:47.560
the Loco Roco to site there is actually a flash minigame that you can play it's

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:54.400
over on spill games website and it will be there until the 21st of November so

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.320
try it while you can and you know download it while you can I'm sorry did

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:06.240
I say that out loud but I will be linking the the site in the chat room

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:15.400
however to go ahead and say this on the podcast it is at games.co.uk slash game

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:25.760
slash loco Roco to dot HTML so give it a try is cute all righty it's the cuteness

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:31.040
there's some people are calling it in chat Loki Roco it's not Loki Roco

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.920
that's a cute name Loki Roco that's all start calling him on this program just

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.800
kidding Loki Roco this rumors been around before but now it's coming into

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:48.520
yet another venue I guess electronic gaming monthly their usual

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:54.280
quarter-man segment of different rumors and speculations well he now has a

01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.020
rumor saying that little big planet will be coming to the PSP in 2009 I mean it

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:03.760
makes sense that they'll do that and I think with actually the controls it

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.240
could work you could easily do that on there I don't know how it look because

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:14.960
the PSP obviously is not as powerful as I don't know the PlayStation 3 but it's

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.360
not being developed by media molecule right no it seems that they are actually

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:26.520
at the oh yeah that's right it won't have them it instead it's a Sony studio

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:31.600
Liverpool wipeout pulse we asked media molecule for comment and what they said

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.480
is that they were gonna moderate this game for being too similar to their own

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:47.400
it's kind of a bummer they said I am Spartacus shut up all right no I it's no

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.080
surprise though that they're gonna hoard this franchise out into the ground that

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.160
there's a PSP version coming out it might actually be pretty cool especially

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.160
if wait for this especially if the levels you get you know assuming this

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.520
whole moderation thing gets figured out if you could get the levels in your ps3

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.120
and transfer them to your PSP that might be pretty awesome actually don't you

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:10.960
think yeah I don't know I don't know if it'd look right oh you can't because the

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.280
proportions and everything I can't imagine that they'd be able to do the

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.880
same kind of quality on the PSP it's got to be scaled down quite a bit all right

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.160
well we'll see I don't know about you guys it sounds pretty interesting to me

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.000
well damn the news will not just stop coming in about burnout paradise what

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.120
was it was just last week we were talking about the awesome old-school

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:34.240
cars are gonna be in the game and now apparently toy cars are coming to burn

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.440
out paradise you know criterion they're really awesome about this they're

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.000
showing you how to keep the game alive it's great well now apparently they are

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.640
going to be introducing tiny little collectible cars no idea if the cars

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.280
themselves will be tiny in the game but they all look like little Hot Wheels and

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.920
they're pretty awesome apparently there's nine cars in all Carson GT

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:01.680
concept p12 Krieger racing wtr hunter takedown 4x4 and hunter Manhattan so on

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.920
and so on apparently they're all gonna come out next year and that's awesome

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.280
criterion just keeps supporting this game I love the monster truck that's

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.400
gonna be awesome this little purple one with flames on it you're putting Hot

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:17.320
Wheels in the game good for them that would be funny if you could actually

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.640
drive the little cars around and they act like big cars you can smash through

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.040
things and just pow-pow power wheels pow-pow all right forget it that would

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.200
be some preschool or driving a car around would be pretty awesome don't

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.640
you think I don't know I'm sure it's just a matter of time but don't expect

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.440
to hear anything on a new burnout game anytime soon because they're still

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.760
supporting the one that's out there but that's not a bad thing not a bad thing

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:49.300
well we knew it was bound to happen since World of Warcraft whatever the

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:55.420
fuck Lich King came out that'll be wrath of the Lich King yes whatever we

01:36:55.420 --> 01:37:03.760
have a level 80 it's a 21 year old and leads a raiding guild and the character

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:15.460
is called Nim NYMH 27 hours worth of leveling and being kept alive by a

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:25.600
healer so Nim got all the experience and made it to 80 and apparently the one

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:32.880
right after was someone called Daris who was suspended by Blizzard at level 79

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:40.280
and bumped back to level 70 after using an exploit oh snap I want to know what

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:47.360
this I want to know what the exploit was interesting grinding in a crypt in the

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:53.600
Grizzly Hills area oh wait a second that is grinding is not a exploit that he

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.880
didn't get banned no Daris got got bled got bled banned or rolled back or

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.840
whatever you want to call it I wonder what that was yeah Walmart yeah he got

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.120
moderated he got Walmarted they were already now what makes it so notable is

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.880
that you know it's supposed to take you like a month to get to 80 you know the

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:18.600
game came out what Wednesday night I'm level 73 and I've been playing pretty

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.320
hardcore most people in my guild are only like 71 maybe 72 well apparently

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:29.800
this place that he was grinding at has a really high respawn rate and monsters

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:35.920
are neutral oh interesting yeah it's a crypt in the Grizzly Hills area there

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:39.640
apparently is there's spam at everybody and crash the server there's a lot of

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.080
level level one boars there and you know and you just kept killing them solid

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:49.900
Goomba comments and says mom bathroom which must have been exactly what

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:53.440
happened here with this guy no you know it despite all the fun being made of

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.080
this guy the thing that he did that the rest of the people aren't doing he went

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:01.920
they obviously found this area in the beta figured it would be a good area to

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.840
go to when the game hit they went straight to this area this was their

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.160
sole intention to gain XP as fast as possible and with a warlock of a certain

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.720
spec it's pretty easy to do if you have a dedicated healer and did nothing but

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.520
level this guy didn't quest or get any of the story out of it he did nothing

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:24.180
but grind his way to 80 so you know make fun of them all you want but he just you

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.000
know they had the goal in mind perseverance honestly a 27-hour gaming

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.560
session marathon gaming session is not the worst we've ever heard of it might

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:36.800
be easy to make fun of Wow and all that stuff but you know what it's it's really

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.120
I've heard of worse you know we talked about some of these record-breaking

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:43.360
things what asteroids some guy played it for what 72 hours straight back in the

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.580
80s I was reading something about asteroids this week I don't remember why

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.160
but was reading about that oh yeah because I think that I think we just

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.680
passed the anniversary of that record being set I think I was reading some

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.840
story on that so hopefully Nim will go back and discover the secret of the

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.720
awesome quests that are in wrath of the Lich King now that he's level 80 and can

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.520
blow through them all real quick anyhow um you know I've been playing wrath of

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.800
Lich King quite a lot this week but something that might actually be able to

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:13.240
divert my attention away from Warcraft this next week is the release of the new

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.460
Xbox experience one thing we've been talking about a lot on this show is the

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:21.560
addition of community games to the Xbox dashboard one of the games that is going

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:28.600
to be coming out is called snake 360 and it has an interesting tie-in to music

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.960
based video games which we've been talking about a lot on this show you

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:35.200
know previously in our history and anything anyway to join us on the show

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.200
tonight to talk about snake 360 is its creator Aaron Teplitsky we're gonna get

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.720
on the phones and I get a hold of Aaron and talk to him a little about a little

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:49.540
bit about his new game snake 360 well hey Aaron are you there yeah I'm right

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.720
here all right well welcome to the show thanks so much for taking the time to be

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.800
on orange lounge radio this evening how you doing this Sunday night I'm doing

01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:00.280
great thank you very much for having me on here I really appreciate it awesome

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.000
not a problem hey we're all about you know the independent games as well as

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.680
the big boys so tell us your game is snake 360 coming to the new Xbox 360

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.400
experience tell us a little bit about snake 360 what is this game all about

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.560
well basically what it is it's similar to you know snake games that you've

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.880
probably seen before on cell phones old computers and whatnot but what it is is

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.640
a complete reimagining graphically you know it's got 3d graphics it runs nice

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:33.120
and smooth and you know it has a very clean look it's a little boxy but you

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:40.920
know that's that's the way snake is so basically you know it's not you're not

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.160
gonna get a huge graphical masterpiece you know if you're looking for that then

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.320
you'll play Gears 2 but what it lacks in graphics it definitely makes up for in

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.040
the gameplay department it's got you know classic gameplay and a whole wide

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.520
range of levels they start you know ridiculous easy you got your four walls

01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:01.360
and that's it and then it goes up to insanely difficult if you like retro

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.200
games arcade games just challenging games in general you're gonna get a lot

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.800
of mileage out of snake 360 especially seeing as how it's got internet-based

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.960
leaderboards you know I think you're selling yourself a little bit short on

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.840
the graphical ability of the game because you know sure we all know the

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:19.580
game snake on cell phones it's you know a blocky game where you kind of go but I

01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:24.020
noticed in watching the trailer on your website snake 360.com you you kind of do

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:28.520
all these little neat camera rotation tricks and and you know for what is

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.620
essentially a basic almost Atari 2600 style game you've really kind of thrown

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:38.600
all these camera and flashy effects to really kind of bring it next-gen well

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.940
you know I what I try and do is I throw in the instant replays and the camera

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:47.720
effects and the different angles and part of it is functionality you know

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.480
related because you know sometimes you want a view of the whole level sometimes

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.200
you want a view of you know just used you can line up better get a view of

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.060
your surroundings maybe want to zoom in maybe you want to zoom out so party just

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:03.480
functionality related but also you know we've come to expect a lot of these

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:07.960
things in games if you're involved in you just you know cut the other guy off

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.320
and surprised the heck out of them and everybody in the room is screaming and

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.120
yelling you're going to watch that over and over and over again to rub it in his

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.120
So, you know, you've got the instant replay for that reason.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.120
Awesome. Sounds great. Well, now, I don't want to talk just about graphics.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.120
Let's talk about music for a minute, because even though this game has nothing to do with arrow stomping or beat matching,

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.120
I hear there's a connection in here for fans of dance music games, which we have a lot of at Orange Lounge.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.120
What's the connection?

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:45.120
Well, actually, it turns out I was looking for music, and I'm no musician, so I went to Kyle Ward and John Mendenhall

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.120
and their record label, SCI Recordings.

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:52.120
Their website right now is scirecordings.com, and we struck a little bit of a deal.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:58.120
And as it turns out, players of the In the Groove series of games and also the more recent Pump Pro

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.120
are going to find that they're familiar with a lot of the music in the game.

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:08.120
And we fleshed it out with some music that they won't be familiar with, and in total, there are nine of their songs in the game.

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.120
And I think that players are going to really enjoy the soundtrack.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:19.120
It's, you know, pumping, you know, get your blood moving, and maybe cause you not to crash into a wall. I don't know.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.120
All right. All right, cool. Yeah, you know, you can hear a lot of that in the trailer.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.120
You can kind of hear some of the music, and it does kind of add a certain intensity to the game,

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.120
especially, I'm sure, for, you know, the more intense modes like Battle Mode and things where you're competing against, you know, other people.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:38.120
Yeah, well, I'm really fond of the soundtrack, and I've been listening to it for months straight working on the game,

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.120
and I'm not sick of it yet. So I guess that probably says that it might actually be working for the game.

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.120
So you mentioned you've been working on the game for months. How long did things take from idea to where we are,

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.120
the game's launching November 19th?

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:58.120
Well, I'll be quite honest with you. Throughout 2007, I was thinking about this game constantly.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:04.120
Like, I'm working this little IT job for a nonprofit, which is completely not the field that I want to be working in.

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:10.120
And just driving from place to place, I'd be thinking about it. I'd be thinking, well, this is how I want this to work,

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:16.120
and this is how, you know, I imagine this. And towards the end of the year, you know, with XNA out,

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:22.120
I just said, well, why don't I take a stab at this? And my original intent was to target Xbox Live Arcade,

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.120
and I actually submitted to them, and it took them a long time to get back to me.

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.120
I don't know what happened with that, but in the time between the time I submitted to them

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.120
and the time they gave me the final answer, they announced community games.

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.120
So I'm thinking, yeah, hey, that's not a bad idea. And then finally they came back and they said,

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:49.120
well, we have limited space for casual action games on Xbox Live Arcade, so we feel it's not a good fit at this time.

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:54.120
So I'm like, well, you know, community games. And that was back in March.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.120
So starting in March, I started working on it, you know, more frequently.

01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:06.120
I actually started, completely started last December. That's when I just, you know, started from scratch with XNA

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:11.120
and, you know, got a snake moving on the screen and whatnot. And then I really took it into high gear in August.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:18.120
So I really started about a year ago, but I'd say, you know, solid work is probably about seven months

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:24.120
of all my spare time went into this game. I know that was a long convoluted answer, but yeah.

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.120
No, that's all right. That's very interesting to kind of hear that you actually had submitted originally

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.120
an Xbox Live Arcade game, but yet they turned it down. And when you look at some of the stuff

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.120
that's on Xbox Live Marketplace that they went through.

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.120
Well, you know, it's interesting you say that because I'm not the only one who's been turned down.

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.120
Have you heard of the Japanese shoot-em-up developer, Cave?

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:47.120
I think I have, yes.

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:53.120
I was absolutely floored when I found out that they submitted two of their games to Live Arcade

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:57.120
and they were turned down because I absolutely adore their games.

01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:01.120
I have a Japanese PS2 that I, you know, basically play shoot-em-ups on.

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:07.120
And I'm planning on getting a Japanese 360 so I can play the upcoming Cave shooters

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.120
if they're not localized here. And I was absolutely floored.

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:16.120
But on the other hand, I felt, well, you know what, if they're being rejected, then maybe I don't feel so bad.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:21.120
At least you're in good company. All right, well, talking about the development cycle of the game,

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.120
you know, a lot of folks kind of, you know, are critical of the Xbox 360 control scheme.

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:31.120
But you kind of found an interesting way around it for a game that requires kind of precision

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.120
in turning like Snake does, right?

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.120
Yeah, well, everybody knows that the 360's D-Pad leaves a lot to be desired.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:43.120
One of the first things I did when I started playing XBLA games was I went and I bought an arcade stick

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:50.120
because even for Pac-Man, you know, it just gums up the works. I can't play Pac-Man with that D-Pad.

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:55.120
So at first, you know, I was thinking, well, you know, we can use the analog sticks and you've got those options.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:00.120
But really the best solution, and I say so in the trailer, not in the trailer,

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:06.120
I say so in the other video I put up, I say so in the documentation and I say so within the game itself.

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.120
The best solution is to use the A, B, X, and Y face buttons.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.120
A is down, Y is up, and then you've got X and B for the sides.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.120
And that is absolutely the best way to control this game.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.120
All right. That sounds like a very creative work around. So that's probably what I'll use.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.120
You know, we weren't using those buttons for anything else.

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.120
I basically, I was thinking, well, you know, we could do turbo boosts, we could do this and that.

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.120
But in the end, I decided for this version, because I might expand it later,

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:37.120
especially considering that the version I'm releasing is not the version I originally anticipated.

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:39.120
I didn't quite get everything that I wanted in there.

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:44.120
But for this version, I decided let's keep the accessibility high.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:49.120
Let's keep the gameplay simple so that, you know, you look at it, you know exactly how it works.

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.120
You can jump right in.

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.120
The challenge of this game is not in new gameplay elements,

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:58.120
but it's in the challenging level designs and all the other things you can do with it.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.120
Well, you know, you say you didn't get to put everything you wanted to in there,

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120
but it sure sounds like you put an awful lot in there.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.120
In fact, some things I haven't really heard of going on with other community games,

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:10.120
like your website, www.snake360.com,

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.120
it has this internet ranking on it with like, what, 50 different leaderboards or something like that?

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.120
Now, community games, they're not going to have achievements. We all know that.

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.120
But this kind of seems like it's like a creative, different work around to still encourage competition.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.120
How does this internet ranking thing work?

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:30.120
Well, it works extremely similarly to the way that any internet ranking board worked

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.120
before we had online leaderboards that were integrated into the game itself.

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:38.120
Anybody who played Ikaruga on GameCube and participated in the rankings there,

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:44.120
they're also ranking from a lot of arcade games where they basically just put codes on the screen.

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:48.120
And you go to their website, you put in the code, yeah, you put in the code, and boom,

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.120
there you are on the internet rankings.

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:54.120
And we'll have you keep track of your email address so that if you submit the same score twice,

01:49:54.120 --> 01:50:02.120
or if you submit two scores for one course, it'll automatically overwrite your lower score with your higher one.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:07.120
And the reason there are over 50 leaderboards is because there's going to be a leaderboard for every course,

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.120
every difficulty, every round you can play in survival mode.

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:15.120
Like, you can go crazy competing for high scores in this game.

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.120
Wow.

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.120
And if you're still finishing up the internet ranking, it should hopefully be ready by the end of next week.

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:24.120
All right. Now, you mentioned there's all these different types of internet ranking boards.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.120
That's because you have all these different types of modes and handicaps in the game,

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.120
and it sounds like you've made this very accessible for children as well as, you know,

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.120
hardcore people that really get into these types of arcade games.

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:39.120
Tell us about some of your favorite modes that you have in the game.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.120
Oh, I mean, the main game mode basically throws you into a course consisting of eight levels.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:49.120
And actually, it may or may not consist of eight levels depending on whether you lose any lives along the way,

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.120
and I'll leave it at that.

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:57.120
But if you can complete all the levels on the course, you'll get a code for internet ranking.

01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:00.120
And the courses are played on several different difficulty levels.

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.120
What you'll get is, you know, basically this kind of the same concept.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:08.120
Like, for example, on Easy, maybe you'll get something that kind of looks like a tree.

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.120
On Normal, you'll get a tree.

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.120
On Difficult, you'll get a tree with more branches, that kind of thing.

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:16.120
So they'll take the same concept, and they'll just keep making it more and more difficult

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.120
as you go up in level.

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:21.120
And, you know, a lot of the level themes are very interesting,

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:25.120
and part of the fun of the game is to see, oh, well, now I'm playing on a new level.

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.120
I wonder what this level's going to look like.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.120
And the Survival mode, well, that's just, you know, classic.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.120
A lot of old Snake games just played like that.

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:38.120
You get one life, and you just last as long as you can, and you grow to ridiculous lengths.

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:44.120
And this version throws in a time limit so that you can't just go in a circle and survive forever,

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:47.120
and you get a time bonus when you pick up a target.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:51.120
But you're just going to have to be really careful not to block yourself off from more targets

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:53.120
or, you know, trap yourself.

01:51:53.120 --> 01:52:00.120
You know, it's very interesting, and one of the fake achievements, I'm going to call them goals,

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:04.120
in the game is to last in there for four minutes, and it's harder than it sounds.

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.120
All right. What about some of the things you've put?

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:10.120
Now, this is something for a player who's really, really good at the game,

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.120
but what about somebody who's not so great at Snake, 360?

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:17.120
There's kind of modes you put in for them, too, right?

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:24.120
Yeah, well, you know what? My mother's even played this game using a couple of handicaps that I've put in.

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:31.120
There's slower speeds. You can turn the Snake speed down to slow or even slowest, which is half the normal speed.

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:37.120
It plays pretty slowly. If you've got good reflexes, you'll want to stick with the normal or the faster speeds,

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:42.120
but there's a slow speed for them, and there's also visual guides that you can turn on

01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:46.120
in the form of lines that extend from the targets in all four directions.

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.120
You can line up more easily with those.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:53.120
And if you play with those on, then you won't be eligible for the Internet ranking,

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.120
but something that will get a lot more people into the game, making it easier, that sort of thing.

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.120
And there's also something exciting I threw in called Kid Mode.

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:06.120
And with this, anybody can play. It's like bumper bowling for Snake.

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:10.120
Basically, you're rushing into a wall, boom, nothing happens.

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:16.120
You're stuck on the wall. Oh, well, now you have three seconds to turn and go somewhere else.

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:25.120
And basically the effect of this is you won't die unless you trap yourself somehow, spiral, that sort of deal.

01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:29.120
So you could just go there all day, and then the easy difficulty has no time limit.

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:33.120
So you could spend three hours on one level and take as much time as you need

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.120
so long as you don't trap yourself.

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:42.120
All right. Sounds like there's something for the young and the old alike in this game, so awesome.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:47.120
Yeah, and if you're not sure whether you're young or old, if you start playing and then the game sees you're having trouble,

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.120
it'll offer to turn one of these handicaps on for you.

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:57.120
Huh, interesting. All right, very cool. Let's talk about the bigger picture for a minute, just community games in general.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:02.120
Kind of not just your game, but all the other games kind of going in when the new Xbox experience launches.

01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:07.120
We've heard kind of leading up to this launch, we've heard a lot about Netflix, we've heard a lot about avatars.

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.120
It seems to me for as big of a deal as at least I perceive this community games thing to be

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:18.120
where we have a lot of great indie developers showing up, we're not hearing as much about it as you would think.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:21.120
You know, with all these, what, 20 games on the service right now.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:26.120
Are you kind of surprised that there's been a little less focus on community games leading up towards the launch?

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:32.120
You know, on one hand I am, but on the other hand I'm really not because, you know, let's say I'm EA or Activision

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:38.120
or some other big-name publisher and I've got $60 games on the shelf from launching a new IP like Mirror's Edge.

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:46.120
And, you know, all of a sudden, Microsoft is promoting the heck out of all these little $5 and $10 and $2.50 games.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.120
And I'm going to be a little bit, you know, pissed off.

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.120
And I'm going to be like, hey, hi, we want to keep selling our $60 games so you guys better lay off

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.120
and delay this to next year or we're going to stop publishing on your console.

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.120
That would be my point of view if I was a big-name publisher.

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.120
So I'd be, if I were them, I'd be happy that they're not plugging the heck out of this stuff.

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.120
And, excuse me, obviously these relationships are very important to Microsoft.

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.120
So, yeah, I'm kind of not surprised that we're a little under the radar.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:22.120
But I think once people get a hold of the new NXC, they're definitely going to notice community games.

01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.120
It's right there with Live Arcade and the Game Store.

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.120
If you go to the game marketplace, it's right there as a category.

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:34.120
And if you've been accepted into the NXC preview and you already have it, you can see plain as day

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.120
there are already 20 games on the service.

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.120
So the visibility is not going to be an issue.

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:43.120
I think it's going to kind of sneak up on people and really surprise them.

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.120
All right. Very cool.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:48.120
You know, one thing, before we let you go, Aaron,

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.120
one thing we always like to ask our guests here on Orange Lounge Radio,

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:52.120
it's the same that we always do every week.

01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:54.120
We want to ask you, how is your gaming week?

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.120
What other kinds of video games have you been playing besides Snake 360?

01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.120
Well, you know what, this last week has been kind of crazy.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.120
I took the whole week off from work, presumably to focus on Snake.

01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:10.120
But then I basically came down with a really bad cold.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:16.120
And my fiancé had a really bad cold as well, you know, starting last week and going into this week.

01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:23.120
So I was very distracted all week, partially with Snake, partially with having a cold.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.120
And then, of course, for a lot of times I couldn't stay focused.

01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:33.120
So I diverted my attention with a little bit of Half-Life 2, which I hadn't really gotten to play very much of yet.

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:35.120
I'm enjoying it a lot.

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:41.120
I completed a few more of the advanced portal maps. I still have one left that I'm completely stuck on.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.120
I picked up the new Namco compilation, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade,

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.120
which is a complete cash-in because it's so shoddily thrown together.

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:55.120
But it features every XBLA release Namco's had up to this point, and it was only 30 bucks.

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.120
So I'm a sucker for those.

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.120
And so I played that a little bit.

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:07.120
And I haven't been able to get out to an arcade, but I usually try to play a step game at least once a week.

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.120
It's the only kind of exercise I can do.

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.120
Well, Aaron, rest up and feel better.

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.120
I know we've been hearing you coughing a little bit tonight,

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:19.120
but I hope by the time this game launches you're well enough to celebrate when NXT comes out on November 19th.

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:22.120
So I'm really excited you were able to have me on here talking about it.

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:29.120
And I hope for all the arcade game fans, retro game fans, just fans of fun games.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:34.120
I hope you guys could take a few minutes of your day to check out Snake 360.

01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:41.120
The trial game will run for four minutes, and you'll be able to try out one of the courses on three different levels

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.120
and battle mode with two players.

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:48.120
And just give it a shot, and I appreciate giving it a try.

01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:54.120
Alright, well the game is Snake 360, and it's launching with the new Xbox 360 experience on November 19th.

01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:57.120
It has got a free time trial for you to check out the game.

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:00.120
And if you want the full game, it's only going to set you back 400 points.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.120
If you want more information in the meantime, check out the website at Snake360.com.

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.120
Aaron, thanks so much for joining us tonight, and best of luck with the game.

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.120
I hope it does really well for you.

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:12.120
Oh, I hope so too. I'd love to quit my IT job.

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:15.120
But thank you very much, Rob, for having me on the program.

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.120
You know, Aaron's been in our chat room tonight while the interview has been going on,

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:24.120
and one interesting thing that I kind of learned during the whole thing is that he has to pay five bucks for his own game

01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.120
on the community games thing.

01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:29.120
He doesn't even get a free copy of his own dang game.

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.120
Boy, Microsoft runs a tight ship.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.120
But I hope you guys will check out the demo.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.120
At least look at the YouTube on the website.

01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.120
It looks pretty rad.

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.120
Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news.

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:49.120
Yeah, speaking of retro games, you may remember the Atari 2600 Flashback systems that were released a while back.

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:54.120
They even had one that was in the true-to-life Woodgrain.

01:58:54.120 --> 01:59:02.120
But now, the same company that brought those out are actually now bringing out USB Atari 2600 controllers.

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:07.120
You can actually use those to play whatever the heck you'd like.

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:10.120
But mostly, they're ideal for main usage.

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:16.120
And they are compatible, of course, with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:20.120
And will run you $1499.

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:24.120
Boy, they just love to whore out the old school Atari 2600 stuff, don't they?

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:26.120
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:31.120
Well, going from an old school controller that's $1499 to something rather new school,

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.120
who doesn't love to play pinball?

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.120
Right, Dark Soccer? You love pinball.

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.120
Pinball is fantastic.

01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.120
You spend a lot of money on pinball, but you buy the authentic pinball machines.

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:44.120
I don't know how big of a fan you are of video pinball games, you know, the types of things.

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:45.120
Some.

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:50.120
Okay. Would you be willing to spend $300 on your obsession?

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.120
Depends. Is it like an ultracade?

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.120
Well, here it is.

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:57.120
Nanotech Entertainment is putting out what's called a pinball wizard controller.

01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:05.120
Real flipper buttons, an actual plunger, motion sensing thing for the tilting on it, $300 for the controller.

02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.120
Very interesting.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.120
I'd do it.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:14.120
You'd have to be pretty, pretty sick into this in order to justify this, but Nanotech is putting this out.

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:17.120
It is the pinball wizard controller.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:23.120
It's got what's called a motion ion or whatever, mode ion motion, IO adapter.

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:25.120
No special drivers required for this.

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.120
It's apparently fully configurable.

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:32.120
It will work with a lot of existing pinball games that are out there right now,

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.120
something they call a fancy-smancy future pinball engine.

02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:37.120
Wow.

02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:43.120
Apparently it ships with a combination of a variety of different 3D pinball games already out there.

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:48.120
Some recreations of famous pinball tables from Gotlib.

02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.120
I don't know what tables those are yet, though. That has been said.

02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:53.120
But you can keep an eye out for more information on this.

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120
Nanotech Entertainment.

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.120
It's nanotechent.com.

02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.120
All I gotta say is the who will sue.

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.120
Why is that, pinball wizard?

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.120
I know, because of the name, right?

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:09.120
I think that by now, you know, it should be fair use.

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:12.120
We'll see. I don't know. It's a little much for me.

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:15.120
I'd rather just take the plunge and get a real machine.

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.120
I need one already, but they're so expensive.

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:20.120
I don't have the money.

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.120
And yeah, I got that collection on the Wii. That's pretty awesome.

02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:26.120
I guess I can just keep that for now.

02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:33.120
Well, there is something that actually is a little interesting, I should say.

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:38.120
As far as some stuff for Rock Revolution.

02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:42.120
If anyone is actually interested in it.

02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.120
Who's interested in that game?

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:50.120
Rock Revolu- you know, as I said, I'm still curious to check it out.

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.120
I'm just waiting for the price to drop, which should happen soon.

02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:55.120
But I also love the movie Showgirls.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.120
So, take my opinion with a grain of salt.

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:02.120
Well, at any rate, there's some downloadable content for Xbox Live Marketplace.

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:06.120
There is Dezro Death Reel. That's a cool song.

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.120
Naoki, remixed by Kuro, which is my only shining star.

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:17.120
Mutsuhiko Izumi with model DD8.

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:22.120
Daisuke Kurosawa with Progressive Baby and Chimera.

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:25.120
Okay, so despite all the crap we've given Rock Revolution and saying,

02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.120
why don't they just bring out Guitar Freaks over here?

02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:32.120
Interesting, yet non-surprising that some of these tracks are, you know, crossover.

02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:36.120
At least the artists are, certainly, from those series coming over to Rock Revolution.

02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:38.120
Interesting.

02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:46.120
There actually is a press release also out by Konami stating that it actually is shipping.

02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:52.120
It will be $129.99 and is available for Xbox 360 and PS3.

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.120
Alright, well, check it out if you really want.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.120
Yeah.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:03.120
Now, what's kind of interesting is, you know, we talk about game piracy a lot.

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:08.120
Well, there was one game, actually, that was out there, World of Goo, that was actually pretty good.

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:13.120
It was more of a puzzle game that came out on PC and WiiWare.

02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:20.120
What's interesting, though, is the developer actually has come out, designer Ron Carmel,

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:26.120
who mentioned that his game has received a 90% piracy rate.

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:33.120
And, yeah, apparently he's been doing some research in the different torrent sites with, you know,

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:40.120
some torrents with 500 cedars and 300 leechers and received emails from people who initially stole the game,

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:44.120
but ended up buying the full product.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:53.120
And it's kind of interesting to see that smaller developers like this are really affected by piracy quite a bit.

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:58.120
It's kind of neat, though, remember they had a t-shirt for this at one time,

02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:01.120
remember they were doing that Target thing with independent games tied in?

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:02.120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.120
Yeah, too bad that never happened.

02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:06.120
It happened for like a week.

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.120
Yes, exactly.

02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.120
That was kind of sad.

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:13.120
Remember there was a rumor that they were going to be going to like Hot Topic or something like that?

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.120
Yeah, whatever happened.

02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.120
Yeah, that never happened either because apparently, you know, Twilight's a lot more popular.

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:20.120
I was going to say, all the shelf space got taken up by Twilight gear.

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.120
Twilight and I'm trying to think of what else Retarded had there.

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.120
Because who doesn't love vampires that sparkle?

02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.120
I mean, really.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:28.120
Sparkle vampires.

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.120
World of Goo, sparkling vampires, I just don't know.

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.120
I just don't know.

02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:41.120
You know, part of me wants to see Twilight, but I also want to remind you, I like Showgirls.

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:45.120
I get to go see it for free the night before it comes out.

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.120
Do you? Are you going to review it for us here on the show?

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.120
I guess. I'm trying to get out of it.

02:04:50.120 --> 02:05:00.120
Because as it is, I managed to get a couple extra tickets for Irene and Nellie's mom.

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:04.120
But my sister might want to go see it, so I'm going to try to see if she can go to my place.

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:08.120
But I don't think that's going to happen, so I probably will have to see it.

02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:11.120
Kuroishi in chat says, oh yeah, and those Candy Mountain shirts.

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:15.120
I own one of those, thank you very much. I bought the Candy Mountain shirt at Hot Topic.

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120
Candy Mountain, Charlie.

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.120
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:21.120
Dark Soccer, are you going to be buying tickets to see Twilight?

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:24.120
I'm dying to know what you feel about Twilight.

02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:27.120
If somebody buys them for me.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:31.120
I was just curious if you were a fan or not a fan.

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:33.120
I want to read the books first.

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.120
Understandable.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:41.120
By the way, there's a new trailer apparently for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that's showing before Twilight that looks pretty hot.

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:42.120
I wouldn't be surprised.

02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:43.120
If you're a Harry Potter fan.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.120
Well maybe that'll be worth going to see it.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.120
Harry Potter!

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:52.120
And a new trailer for Star Trek is apparently in front of the new James Bond movie.

02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:55.120
Which I need to go see. I love James Bond.

02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:01.120
Have you seen the new trailer? Speaking of trailers, since we're totally off topic right now, a new trailer for Watchmen?

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:05.120
No, I haven't seen the new trailer. Just the last one with the Smashing Pumpkins song.

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:11.120
Because I'm actually reading the graphic novel there.

02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:16.120
So a lot of the stuff that I've seen in the graphic novel, obviously I can see in the trailer, it's kind of cool.

02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:24.120
What's interesting though is one of the songs that's in the trailer is a song that's on one of the radio stations in Grand Theft Auto IV.

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:29.120
Actually it's the trailer, the song that they used when they first teased Grand Theft Auto IV.

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:32.120
They had their teaser trailer. It was that same song.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:36.120
Hmm. Interesting. Lots of good movies on the lineup for next year.

02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:40.120
A lot of anticipated movies. Of course we had a few of them this year between The Dark Knight and everything else.

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:43.120
By the way, doesn't Dark Knight come out on Blu-ray pretty soon?

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.120
Yeah, like the second or third.

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:47.120
Here's what I really want to know. When's Mamma Mia come out?

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:49.120
Actually shortly after that. I think it's like the 10th.

02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:50.120
Awesome!

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.120
Or whatever that next Tuesday is.

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.120
Just in time for Christmas. Hint hint. Alright, anyhow.

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:56.120
Just in time for your SingStar ABBA.

02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:01.120
Exactly. Oh man, December is now ABBA month here at the home of Roberts.

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:05.120
Anyhow, Left 4 Dead. Here's another game I've got to check out.

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:09.120
I've just got no freaking time left between all the Wrath of the Lich King I've been playing.

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:14.120
Left 4 Dead apparently brings some clues to other Valve games.

02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:16.120
Team Fortress 2.

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:23.120
Apparently, according to Kotaku, one of their readers actually was looking through the Left 4 Dead demo and found something very interesting.

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:28.120
There's a little cereal called Choco Bites that's in the apartment that's in the game.

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:35.120
And apparently the back of the box promotes a free 6 inch Team Fortress 2 action figure.

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.120
It says collect all 10.

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:42.120
Apparently though, there's only 9 Team Fortress 2 classes out there right now.

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:50.120
So a 10th one is coming soon, apparently, if this little Easter egg is to be believed.

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:55.120
Very good catch though. I've got to say, that's pretty impressive. Somebody caught that.

02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:01.120
But Valve? Valve has some pretty rabid fans and I understand why.

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:05.120
They are definitely masters of the first person genre, I would say.

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:09.120
Between Half-Life and Portal and now Left 4 Dead is generating tons of buzz.

02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:11.120
People love their Valve, don't they?

02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:13.120
They sure do, but guess what else people like?

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:14.120
What's that?

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:15.120
Rare.

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:23.120
There's actually an Easter egg in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts that says,

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:32.120
They're all in the pipeline, you know. New Killer Instinct, Battletoads and forced Gemini gains, even Ghoulies 2.

02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:36.120
Oh, you'll never believe that. I've ruined my own humorous tape.

02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.120
Hmm.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:40.120
So.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:45.120
Either they like to tease us in these games or I just don't know what it is anymore.

02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:51.120
Well, we've had the tease with Killer Instinct before, so who knows?

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:53.120
What a tease that is.

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:56.120
Well, you know, there's been other games to do this before.

02:08:56.120 --> 02:09:03.120
Like, remember my favorite one of those of all is the one in Final Fantasy VII when Cloud is nuts.

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:11.120
And he says Xenogias. As in Z-E-N-O-G-I-A-S.

02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:12.120
Yeah.

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:13.120
That'd be funny.

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:16.120
That'd be funny if the people translating it weren't told about Xenogears.

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:19.120
Kind of going back to the whole Left 4 Dead thing.

02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:24.120
They should make some other games in the whole Half-Life Valve universe.

02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:30.120
Including, I think, that they should make one based off the parody Half-Life Full Life Consequences.

02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.120
If you've ever seen that video, it's hilarious.

02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:34.120
No, I have not. Sorry to say.

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:36.120
It's hilarious. Retarded.

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:42.120
Good comment from chat, kind of going back a story, talking about the whole Team Fortress 2 thing.

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:45.120
Seg has an interesting thought on what that could be all about.

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:49.120
He says, I think that the 10th is actually the announcer for an action figure.

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:53.120
The announcer is the 10th character, and the announcer could be an action figure.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:57.120
So no new class, just the acknowledgement that the announcer is the 10th character.

02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.120
Interesting theory.

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:01.120
An action figure? Huh?

02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.120
Were you listening to the story? The back of the box teases, collect all 10 action figures.

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.120
Oh, and the announcer is the 8th.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:08.120
There you go.

02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.120
I thought they were actually making action figures, which would be awesome.

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.120
No, but that would be kind of rad too, don't you think?

02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:14.120
Alright, anyhow.

02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.120
That's it for the stories tonight until we get to some last minute stories.

02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:19.120
But now is the part of the show where we like to open up the Skype line.

02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:21.120
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:23.120
Or our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:26.120
Our 800 number is toll free in the US and Canada.

02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.120
But if you're in Europe or somewhere far away, you might want to consider using Skype.

02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:32.120
Because it's going to cost you money otherwise.

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:34.120
Meanwhile, while we wait for a call to come in...

02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:36.120
Oh, never mind. We've got calls coming in right now.

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.120
We'll hold off on last minute stories for just a little bit.

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.120
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?

02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.120
This is Akhil Ripper.

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.120
Yes, we do.

02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.120
How are you doing, Akhil Ripper? What's on your mind tonight?

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:50.120
Well, I'm...

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.120
Well, what was I?

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:55.120
Just ranting about the Left 4 Dead.

02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.120
Ranting about Left 4 Dead.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.120
That's just completely awesome.

02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:03.120
Tell us something about Left 4 Dead.

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:06.120
Because I don't think any of us in studio have actually got a chance to really play it yet.

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:09.120
I know it's kind of on the list of things we want to do.

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:12.120
But I know for me, I still have the Mirror's Edge demo to play too.

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.120
But there's been another game taking up a lot of my time.

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.120
If you haven't heard.

02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.120
Well, plus you are, as we all know, a WoW addict.

02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:23.120
Yes, we do.

02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:28.120
We... what can I say?

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:34.120
We're an old WoW addict, sort of.

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:37.120
Recovering. Well, tell us about Left 4 Dead.

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:40.120
What makes this game so flippin' awesome?

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:43.120
Well, it is...

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:46.120
Well, you have... you are playing like four...

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.120
You have a maximum of four people.

02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.120
And you are to survive.

02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:56.120
Survive.

02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:01.120
Like this stomping zombie assault.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:04.120
That just blows you away, really.

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:10.120
It's so utterly good.

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:12.120
Now, if I... correct me if I'm wrong.

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.120
Even if you're playing this game by yourself.

02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:19.120
You actually have like three other people with you that are all run by artificial intelligence, right?

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.120
How does that work? Is it good?

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:25.120
I would imagine that they would be stupid.

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.120
I haven't got much experience playing with bots, really.

02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:36.120
Since... well, it's all about the multiplayer experience.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:43.120
And playing it to online play.

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.120
That's the only thing that's interesting in my way.

02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.120
Toshin in our chat room seems to think the bot AI is probably better than humans.

02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.120
Act-Def agrees, though, that Left 4 Dead is really all about the multiplayer.

02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:02.120
Yeah, but I would disagree.

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:08.120
Yeah, and the bots are, from my point of view, quite stupid.

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:11.120
Especially, really, if you...

02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:21.120
Well, try... but then again, I'm not in one way super at shooters in a way, since...

02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:25.120
Well, in one way, it's sort of weird in one way.

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:36.120
Since my take on most shooters, on single-play shooters that is, is that give me god mode and that's it, really.

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:43.120
But multiplayer shooters, you can't do that.

02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:47.120
Good for me in one way, so I get to learn to play in one way.

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:51.120
So you can't cheat in this game. Well, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this game,

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:55.120
and Elise can check out the demo right now. It's out there.

02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.120
Yeah, I have actually been playing the demo for a week now.

02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:00.120
Wow.

02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:14.120
The demo was released actually last Friday to us that pre-bought it.

02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:15.120
Oh, pre-ordered?

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.120
Yeah.

02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:22.120
I remember that this game, if I remember right, this had some of the longest lines of PAX, too, the previous of this game.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:26.120
So a lot of people are definitely anticipating this one, and it's Valve. People love their Valve.

02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:27.120
There you have it.

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.120
Yeah, but if you think of it, it hasn't, well, what is it?

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:38.120
It was originally shown at E3 in 2007, actually.

02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:53.120
And then at some point it got a bit rewamped since all the four playable characters got completely new character rewamps.

02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:57.120
And now it's looking pretty good.

02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:02.120
All right. Well, okay, Ripper, we've got to let you go, but have a good time enjoying Left 4 Dead, the demo,

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:05.120
and have fun with the full game when it comes out, all right?

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.120
I will.

02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.120
All right, take care. Take care, buddy.

02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:13.120
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:18.120
And we'll take a couple more calls tonight, and then we've got to get to some last minute stories

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:21.120
and get on out of here for the night, if you can believe it.

02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:23.120
All right, let's go ahead and go to the phones.

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.120
Hello, this is Seg.

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:30.120
Hey, Seg, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:43.120
Well, earlier this week, Gamasutra put up an article about IP property in academia, specifically with game schools.

02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:55.120
And the thing that really got me were the comments that the president of DigiPen really caught me off guard,

02:15:55.120 --> 02:16:02.120
especially coming from a president of an educational institution.

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:11.120
Specifically, apparently the policy at DigiPen is that any intellectual property presented in the classroom

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:19.120
is solely owned by DigiPen, at least that's the policy as I understand it.

02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:31.120
And as a graduate of a game design program, but at a different institution, Emerson College,

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:41.120
I found that really offensive to the student because it says that...

02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:50.120
I know I'm skipping over some of the details on it, but apparently the reason that they chose to decide that,

02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:53.120
oh, the school owns all the property and has all the control...

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:58.120
So just to clarify, you're saying if a student creates something for a class project, the school owns it?

02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:00.120
At DigiPen, yes.

02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:13.120
And the reason that he cites is that, oh, the IP laws are so complicated and it just makes things easier and all this.

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:20.120
And I just felt that that's missing a very large significant teaching moment,

02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:26.120
an opportunity to the students by just pushing off to the side.

02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:34.120
Now, at least with Emerson College, which is my personal experience,

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:39.120
the policy is basically a quasi-shared where Emerson...

02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:47.120
I made a thesis video game called Antidote for my BFA thesis, and I own it.

02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:52.120
It's mine with... I mean, I could put an asterisk on the software that I used and all that,

02:17:52.120 --> 02:18:00.120
but as far as Emerson College's role, I use their equipment and they have a distribution license, pretty much.

02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:04.120
They can showcase it as, here's what one of our students did.

02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:06.120
But they don't own it.

02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:12.120
They don't own everything, which allowed me the capability to do whatever I want with it.

02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:19.120
Whereas students of DigiPen, apparently, don't have that ownership in their own thing.

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.120
I mean, for example, you may know a game called Portal.

02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:24.120
Yeah, I've heard of it.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.120
You may have heard of it.

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.120
It was actually a few students from DigiPen who created a game called Nebacular Drop, which...

02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:35.120
I remember that.

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.120
So...

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.120
Oh, okay, weird.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.120
No, go ahead.

02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:43.120
There was the feedback loop.

02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:48.120
They made Nebacular Drop and that was the game that got them the job at Valve.

02:18:48.120 --> 02:19:00.120
But it was sort of just this gentleman's agreement that DigiPen wouldn't care that it's slightly similar because they got the jobs at DigiPen.

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.120
But it wasn't...

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:09.120
There's no guarantee that any student at DigiPen would get that affordance.

02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:17.120
Is it possible that DigiPen does this, just theorizing here, maybe in a way to protect the students so that students aren't ripping off from each other?

02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:23.120
Like, you see something really cool that another student presents and you're like, wow, maybe I want to kind of make that game someday.

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.120
Could it be a protection thing?

02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.120
That's sort of afforded already.

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:33.120
I mean, somebody else outside of the classroom can also do that, regardless.

02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:47.120
Here's my sort of test, and for anyone, not just for video games, but for anyone wanting to do a higher education in creative arts, and even not just creative arts,

02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:54.120
is just ask the question, can I put my work in a Creative Commons license?

02:19:54.120 --> 02:20:00.120
Can I choose, specifically choose, to do a creative license or not?

02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:11.120
Because then you have the choice of where you want to put your work, and incorporating whether it be commercial or free or Creative Commons work into your work.

02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:23.120
Because the sort of weird thing that hasn't been addressed is because DigiPen owns this work, you can't do copy left, apparently.

02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:40.120
I mean, that's a murky area, and I'm not Mr. Lawyer here, but it kind of means that you can't do the copy left attributions that you're supposed to do if you use a Creative Commons license thing.

02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:51.120
Because it's a restrictive copyright owned to one particular entity that doesn't allow you to copy left.

02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:56.120
You know, I didn't see the story on Commons Studio, but now I'm very curious about it, especially if there's any kind of follow up to it.

02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:01.120
Because you would think at some point this is going to be challenged, you know, when one of the students creates something they want to make.

02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:09.120
The comments on there have been rather debated extensively.

02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:15.120
And there are other schools, I mean, the thing that gets me is that this isn't unique to the video game industry.

02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:24.120
People like to make that oppression, but it's not. It's general creative endeavors.

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:33.120
Well, you know, I studied television and radio when I was in college, and one of the classes I was in we had to write a script for a TV show, basically.

02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:35.120
But we essentially owned it, you know what I mean?

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:44.120
It wasn't something that we would write a script and the college would own it, but at the same time we were encouraged, if we wanted to, to write a script based on a show that was already out there.

02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:52.120
Exactly. And let's say you wrote that script that was heavily lifted off of something, it would be all null and void.

02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:58.120
But then you got the plagiarism, which is already policies in any college, and that counts as plagiarism and all that.

02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:05.120
But for some reason at our school it kind of didn't matter, because obviously you weren't going to say, it was just for a school project, you know, whatever.

02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:10.120
But there were some people that were writing scripts that they planned to use someday in the real world.

02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:12.120
Exactly.

02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:28.120
And I just find it very troubling that this certain academic institution wants to not only not teach IP policy, I mean, those were classes that I was required...

02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:40.120
I basically went to a film school and created my own little curriculum for interactive media within the New Media program.

02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:53.120
But there were a lot of kids who made their foundation and were able to travel off from that independently of the college, because they had the capability of doing so.

02:22:53.120 --> 02:23:01.120
And it strikes me that DigiPen doesn't do that, or want people to do that.

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:18.120
It just seems that they're more centered on making people that will fit into a role in a larger company, and denying the choice of having students not only form a grander knowledge of the industry,

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:32.120
and being an actual participant and professional that is aware of the industry, but just making people that fit into smaller slots.

02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:41.120
And I think that's a missed opportunity for students, to box them in that way.

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:50.120
I can't talk about this for too much longer, but I gotta read some comments from chat, because chat room has some very interesting things to say.

02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:56.120
YYR, who happens to be Aaron, who we talked to earlier in the show about Snake 360 says,

02:23:56.120 --> 02:24:06.120
Just to clarify, Microsoft doesn't touch your IP if you publish a game on XNA, but the flip side of the coin, they're not responsible if you get sued over IP infringement and so on.

02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:07.120
Exactly.

02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:14.120
Bobby from the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf says something else interesting here, he's done some stuff with game design, I know he's played around with XNA.

02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:21.120
You know, I really thought this was standard with game design colleges. This is the first time I've heard of a game design curriculum that didn't own your homework.

02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:29.120
Hell, the last company I worked for owned anything I created as a program, even on my off hours, because I was dumb, and didn't contest that portion of the employment contract.

02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:45.120
First of all, that's very different. In an employment context, that is extremely different. And the reason is that, in an employment context, you are being paid to do this work.

02:24:45.120 --> 02:25:02.120
And that is completely different from being in an educational facility where you are paying or funding on your own, scholarships or whatever, to get an education to formulate a base for you to get to an employment situation or make your own company.

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:20.120
So it's vastly different than employment. In the employment context, yes, you were doing work for hire, but in the educational aspect, you're not doing this work for hire.

02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:34.120
I just want to clarify real quick, the company that he did, it was actually a defense contractor company, but they would still own the games he created on the weekend. But I guess the difference here is, in a school, you pay them, in a company, they pay you.

02:25:34.120 --> 02:26:03.120
Now, like in California, there's laws that prevent a company from having that overreach, where as long as you do not use company equipment, you are not on company time, and you don't use company-specific knowledge, the company you're employed to cannot take claim of anything you do, as long as there's that separation.

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:16.120
Of course, not every state is California. But that's also in the legal framework of you're being paid to do creative work. But in an educational environment, you're not being paid to do work.

02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:43.120
You're paying them, if anything, for a rental fee. I had to reduce it so simply. But you're paying the institution for that, and there's no precedence for that, besides very few colleges making that sort of ownership policy, which a lot of colleges don't really go that far.

02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:54.120
They may have some influence, some collusion there, but to have complete and utter ownership like that is not very common.

02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:13.120
Thank you for bringing up a topic, especially on a night when we've been talking about moderation, and talking about these usage rights. I think sometimes these are things a lot of people don't think about that goes on behind the scenes.

02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:24.120
Regardless, for anyone out there who is looking to apply to colleges or knows someone who does, regardless of the field, these are questions you should ask.

02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:38.120
I'm not saying that you should not completely avoid any one institution based on their policy, but this is something you should know as an informed applicant in order to really give an evaluation of a school.

02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:40.120
In other words, be aware.

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:47.120
Be aware. This is something you should ask the admission counselor regardless of whatever field, even if it's creative or not.

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:52.120
This is something you should be aware about before you make your decision for your higher education.

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:58.120
Very good advice, especially considering we have a lot of people around that age that listen to this program saying thanks so much for the insight. Always appreciate it.

02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.120
Thanks for having me. It's always great to be on the show.

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:06.120
Alright, you are most welcome. Take care. And hey, I hear there's another episode of Homestar Runner coming out very soon.

02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:13.120
Now, now, first of all, I'm only representing myself and being only myself.

02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:14.120
Alright, fair enough.

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.120
But there's also that coming around the bit.

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:18.120
Alright, sounds good.

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:19.120
Alright, take care everybody.

02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.120
You too, buddy. Bye bye.

02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:28.120
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-LR, we're probably going to do one more quick, quick call and then we're going to call it a night.

02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:30.120
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:33.120
Oh, it's me. What's up guys?

02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.120
Not much. What's up?

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:48.120
Nah, just hanging in there, just trying to like, you know, since I'm currently unemployed right now because that job market is like busting my balls right now, I'm just holding myself back from gaming in general.

02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.120
Except for the stuff that I managed to get for free.

02:28:51.120 --> 02:29:05.120
But yeah, let me see, I just found out over the weekend that Capcom, in their most infinite wisdom, quote unquote, you know, I'm being sarcastic here, has decided to hold back, you know, the arcade release of Street Fighter IV.

02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:11.120
Effectively, you know, just saying, fuck you, we're not going to do it, go fuck off, the arcade industry is dead.

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:21.120
Which is pretty, I mean, I don't blame them though. I guess I don't blame them because, you know, fighting games, especially in the arcade level, are kind of, have been relegated to a niche recently.

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:33.120
It's not like DDR where it has that casual appeal where people can just like, you know, easily jump on it, you know, jump into it without any risk.

02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:41.120
Whereas you've got fighting games that are much more difficult, they have a much higher learning curve in terms of moves and all that.

02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:46.120
Zaku, I hate to kind of throw you a curve ball here, but you made a very interesting comment on the last call.

02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:49.120
The kind of tizing, because you're talking about job market, economy, blah blah blah.

02:29:49.120 --> 02:30:00.120
You were mentioning on kind of, to SEG's phone call here, when I worked full time as a mobile software engineer, I had to sign a typical confidentiality agreement basically stating that anything I wrote or ran on their machines became essentially theirs.

02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:07.120
In light of what's happened, what do you think about kind of everything we've been talking about?

02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:16.120
From what I, I actually read that story earlier this week, you know, about DigiPen basically, you know, and their policy on owning everything you pretty much submit to them.

02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:21.120
Which is kind of typical. It's kind of typical for how a company operates.

02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:31.120
You know, where if you're working in software engineering for example, or any work for hire stuff that you do at freelance levels, you pretty much don't own the content.

02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:36.120
The creator, you know, the actual, the person who commissioned it actually does.

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:41.120
In this case, you know, the person commissioning in a software engineering company is the company itself.

02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:49.120
You know, it needs employees to actually, you know, like me as a software engineer to actually type in the code on the screen and make it work.

02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:54.120
But, you know, it does, you know, it does worry me somewhat.

02:30:54.120 --> 02:30:59.120
But then again, I don't, you know, I don't really, I can really understand why they do it.

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:01.120
Just to cover their own asses.

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:05.120
In case, you know, they want to, they want to avoid as much litigation as possible.

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:10.120
In terms of, you know, who owns the IP, the school, or the student.

02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:19.120
And, you know, yeah, it does, it basically, it solves a lot of problems before they even, you know, before they even creep up.

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:30.120
I know it's a sad reality that, you know, many, many people actually submit, you know, submit work and then realize that, oh, oh, oh crap, I might have used a good idea.

02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:36.120
And then now they're screwed because it's going to take a while to create something much better than what you already submitted.

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:40.120
Because you can't use it anymore because it's someone else who owns it.

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:47.120
Zach, I've got another kind of interesting question for you because, you know, you talking about having gotten laid off in the mobile company kind of makes me think about this.

02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:53.120
I don't think I mentioned this earlier in the program, but earlier this week I was actually interviewed by the local news.

02:31:53.120 --> 02:32:01.120
They were doing a story about the Warcraft launch and they wanted to talk about how video games are like economy.

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:14.120
They're kind of economy, in spite of our falling economy, people were still lining up to buy this game, you know, and I'm using Warcraft for example, but they were kind of talking about how video games were economy, they were rescission proof.

02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:18.120
And I said, sorry, recession, recession proof.

02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:26.120
And I was trying to say they're not so much recession proof as they are recession resistant, because they're still, you know, you look at what happened at EA a couple weeks ago.

02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:33.120
I'm sure that Wii's might still be selling like hotcakes and so on, but it's not, all areas are not recession proof.

02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:40.120
Of course, I mean, you have basically game devs that are failing left and right, shutting down, laying off people.

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:45.120
You know, it's probably because they're not taking in enough money for the games that they're selling.

02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:57.120
But on the other hand, on the consumer level, you realize that people, you know, games right now are much cheaper than any big ticket luxury items like iPods or flat screen TVs.

02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:04.120
I mean, even the used game market is still thriving right now because of the recession, because people want to play for cheap.

02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:14.120
That's why, you know, GameStop's making a killing right now with the, you know, with the used games that they have on the, you know, right there in the bins.

02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:18.120
Because people want to, you know, they want instant satisfaction in that sense.

02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:26.120
And some of them are willing to save up for something, you know, something like $50 or $60 for like one game, must have game of this year.

02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:31.120
You know, personally, I would pick Fallout 3 over Left 4 Dead, but that's just me.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:38.120
But people have their, you know, they're going to be saving up for something, for that one thing they want to get this year.

02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:44.120
Since the economy's, you know, really going under and they're not in the position to actually spend as much as they did last year.

02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:49.120
Alright, well, Zaku, we got to wrap up and let you go, but any other quick last thoughts for our listeners?

02:33:49.120 --> 02:34:00.120
Let me see, the arcade scene's not dead, it's just going through a, just going, it just basically got hit in the stomach, it's just trying to get up right now.

02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:02.120
Alright.

02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:05.120
Alright, Zaku, take care buddy, thanks for the call.

02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:07.120
And good luck on the job hunt.

02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:09.120
Thanks, bye.

02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:10.120
Bye.

02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:12.120
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:14.120
It's a very interesting call tonight.

02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:20.120
That's what I freaking love about this show, is letting the listeners kind of call in to talk about what they want to.

02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:23.120
And sometimes they bring up some really interesting topics.

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:32.120
So just the whole IP thing and talking about people that are, you know, actually in the games industry and the economy and its effects and fascinating stuff.

02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:37.120
Last minute stories tonight, Dark Sakura, Loki, anybody, last minute stories for us tonight?

02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:38.120
I like pie.

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:41.120
I do too, I want some pumpkin pie, real bad.

02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:43.120
Loki, any pie-licious stories for us?

02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:48.120
No, I don't have pie-licious stories, but this is kind of cheesy.

02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:50.120
Mmm, cheesecake?

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:52.120
You can put cheese on apple pie.

02:34:52.120 --> 02:35:00.120
Anyways, Uwe Boll has been charged, no, hold on, hold on, he's not making another movie.

02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:02.120
Well at least this is not an announcement of another movie.

02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:10.120
He's being charged with libel and is being forced to pay a 2.1 million dollar fine.

02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:17.120
Apparently he had bad mouthed the Fantastic Films International Company, the very film distributor handling his movies.

02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:26.120
And now he lost his court case and so now he has to pay money, oops.

02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:28.120
So that's kind of funny.

02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:29.120
Hilarious.

02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:30.120
Hilarious.

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:34.120
That's what he gets for being a dick!

02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:39.120
And then, what else was I looking up here?

02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:40.120
Not too much.

02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:42.120
Probably pornography.

02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:48.120
No, not pornography, I was looking up some old videos of the Half-Life 2 stuff.

02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:52.120
You know, Half-Life, Full Life, something or other.

02:35:52.120 --> 02:36:00.120
Anyways, the same guy did some other videos called the Idiots of Gary's Mod and they're hilarious.

02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:08.120
And I also found a cam recording of the new Star Trek trailer.

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.120
I actually watched that as well.

02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.120
It looks interesting. It doesn't look like a Star Trek trailer at first.

02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:16.120
I watched it with no sound.

02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:21.120
You don't need sound to see how awesome Siler is as Spock.

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:23.120
That's all I'm saying, yo.

02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:26.120
Alright, well, it sounds like that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:28.120
We gotta wrap up! Get on out of here!

02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:29.120
In ribbons and bows?

02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:31.120
That's right, in ribbons and bows.

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:35.120
Next week is the week before Thanksgiving, if you can believe it.

02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:37.120
Time is flying before you know what Christmas is going to be here.

02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:38.120
It's not loud!

02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:41.120
No, Rob, you have to be politically correct!

02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:42.120
It's the holiday!

02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:44.120
I'm sorry, the Harvest Festival, whatever.

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:46.120
You know what, you know what, you know what.

02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:47.120
What?

02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:52.120
We had a discussion about this in my team meeting network.

02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:55.120
They're like, okay, who is offended if we say Christmas?

02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:56.120
No one raised their hand.

02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:58.120
Okay!

02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:04.120
We're calling it whatever we want to in this room and then we'll call it the holiday.

02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:06.120
The appreciation.

02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:14.120
Most Jewish people I've talked to, Jewish being the biggest religion and most obvious one that doesn't do Christmas, they do Hanukkah instead, right?

02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:18.120
Most Jewish people I know are kind of used to it and don't take personal offense to it.

02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:21.120
And kind of get into the whole celebration thing.

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:23.120
You can celebrate the secular holiday.

02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:24.120
Exactly!

02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:25.120
I mean, to be perfectly honest.

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:29.120
They get into the Hallmark side of it, but not the meaning behind it necessarily.

02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:37.120
To be perfectly honest, you know, my own celebration is yule, you know, if our fireplace wasn't shit, I'd be burning a log every year.

02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:40.120
You know, it's just whatever, you know.

02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:56.120
Christmas itself, as most people know it in the Western world, is a secular holiday given a name by the Catholic Church to convert pagans because Jesus was not born in December.

02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:58.120
It was October.

02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.120
So Halloween is closer to Jesus' birthday?

02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:01.120
Yes.

02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:02.120
Alright, just curious.

02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:04.120
It'll be whenever they do the census.

02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:08.120
Alright, look, I don't want to get into religion chat too deep on a video game show.

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:11.120
No, I think it's funny, but that's okay.

02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:18.120
Alright, but we'll do a politically incorrect Christmas and deal with it special or something like that.

02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:21.120
Yes, and act deft refers to zombie Jesus.

02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:27.120
Alright, maybe we'll do a Christmas gaming marathon or politically incorrect.

02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.120
Gaming marathons are the big thing right now.

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:34.120
People playing games for hours and hours on end to raise money for charity.

02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.120
We need to do something like that here at Orange Andredo.

02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:37.120
I don't know how or when.

02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:38.120
A play-a-thon?

02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:39.120
Yeah, a play-a-thon.

02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:40.120
As long as it's not TDR.

02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:42.120
No, we need to play like obscure games.

02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:44.120
Like we'll let the users vote on what we're going to play.

02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:47.120
How about, you know, I should catalog my collection.

02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.120
As long as they don't pick some of the shit that's in my collection because I do have some shit in the collection.

02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:54.120
We should pool like 40 games.

02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:56.120
Act deft says guardian legend.

02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:57.120
That can be one of the games.

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:01.120
Like every hour play a new game and let the chatroom vote on what game we play each hour.

02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:03.120
I'm totally, totally down for that.

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:04.120
We should do something like that.

02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.120
It'll be fun.

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:07.120
And we'll call it our, you know, Christmas marathon.

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:11.120
Alright.

02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:13.120
Who called it Jesusween?

02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:15.120
That's great.

02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:16.120
Alright, anyhow.

02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:21.120
We'll try to figure out that idea and bring you more on that a little later.

02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:23.120
And we can open up the studio.

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.120
You don't have to talk to my roommate about it.

02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:27.120
We can open up the studio and have people in and out of here throughout the hour and something like that.

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:29.120
Anyhow, we've got to wrap up.

02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:30.120
Get out of here for the night.

02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:32.120
So everybody's final thought.

02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:34.120
Loki, your final thought for us tonight?

02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:37.120
I have a headache now too.

02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.120
My final thought tonight is child's play.

02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:44.120
Because Sega is screaming in chatroom.

02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:45.120
Mention child's play.

02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:46.120
Child's play is on now. Mention.

02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:48.120
So there you go. Child's play.

02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:54.120
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:57.120
I think Dark Sakura is zombie Jesus.

02:39:57.120 --> 02:39:58.120
Alright.

02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:02.120
I just found out one of my zip drives has escaped my keychain somehow.

02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:03.120
That sucks.

02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:05.120
I hope there is not pornography in there.

02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:07.120
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight.

02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:10.120
Thanks you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.

02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:13.120
Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:14.120
Spread the word.

02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:16.120
We really appreciate it.

02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:19.120
Well, that's how Aaron from Snake360 got on the show in the first place.

02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:23.120
Because a friend of his told him about the show and worked out the whole interview thing with us.

02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:30.120
So it just goes to show, no matter where you are in the game playing spectrum, whether you just play them or you write them,

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:33.120
spread the word about Orange Launch Radio because we are a community based program.

02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:37.120
And if you have no friends or you're just feeling up to it because you want to really help,

02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:40.120
leave us a nice review on iTunes, a nice five star review on there.

02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:44.120
Or any of those other podcasting sites throughout the internet because it also helps us spread the word.

02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:49.120
Because that's all we got. No fancy magazines or TV stations backing us up, just us.

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.120
And we got to take on those big boys all ourselves.

02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:53.120
So that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:58.120
Next time we will see you is one week from tonight on next Sunday at AllGames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific.
