1
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:24,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, November 30th, 2008, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC gets controversial DRM, a 10-year-old game gets a new patch, and could Sackboy soon become a Street Fighter?

2
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:35,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,915
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that show on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:42,456
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Not joining us tonight, sadly, is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,060
[SPEAKER_04]: She is out tonight.

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we'll be back next week.

8
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us, say, well, why am I saying hopefully?

9
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:53,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, she better be back next week or we're going to be in trouble.

10
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

11
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

12
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:57,049
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Loki?

13
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,111
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:16,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You should tell them how you got injured

15
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:31,710
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

16
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,504
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:15,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably pushed the envelope a little bit too much because, you know, when we were doing this race, we were running.

18
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everybody that was racing was really into it, and it was a lot of fun.

19
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:20,888
[SPEAKER_04]: My roommate did an awesome job with the whole thing.

20
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, it was very... You should have done it, Loki, except you probably wouldn't have been able to do it because you would have been...

21
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:28,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Like me.

22
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:30,518
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't get out of breath.

23
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:33,219
[SPEAKER_05]: My legs get sore before I get out of breath.

24
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,081
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what ultimately happened to me is that actually I started getting sore in the area where I had my surgery and I had to come home and take painkillers.

25
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:40,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so bad.

26
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up passing out pretty much during the time we had the show.

27
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:51,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little embarrassing, yeah, but we've all done dumb shit that sometimes takes us out of our other commitments.

28
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, last week I went and played Airsoft and I...

29
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Poison Oak, but I don't know if it's Poison Oak.

30
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:57,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't itch.

31
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:00,869
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope you didn't bring that in this house.

32
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:01,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, I think I'm immune.

33
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had it, but I don't want it now.

34
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had it either, so I don't know if it's Poison Oak.

35
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks like a rash on my arm where I was crawling through brush and grass and stuff like that.

36
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:18,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what it is, but it just made a rash and doesn't really itch.

37
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:22,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Poison Oak is really itchy and spreads like crazy, but...

38
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, whatever.

39
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,238
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun, though.

40
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:27,579
[SPEAKER_05]: We shot each other with guns.

41
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, shooting each other is always fun.

42
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting is what I ended up doing last week instead of the show is I was kind of like waking up in the night.

43
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:41,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was using the Xbox 360 to kind of check out Netflix and all the streaming movies.

44
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:47,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing I am loving, obscure-ass documentaries that you can only find on Netflix.

45
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, I watched a couple of them.

46
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:53,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched, get this, there was a documentary I watched on Netflix

47
00:03:55,118 --> 00:04:01,083
[SPEAKER_04]: strippers that they were these girls that turned to stripping to make ends meet after Hurricane Katrina.

48
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,622
[SPEAKER_04]: and the movie was called... Well, that's weird and specific.

49
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:04,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

50
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:09,744
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie was called Hurricane Strip was the name of the movie and I'm like, I have to watch this.

51
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how obscure is that?

52
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:12,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, right?

53
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:13,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

54
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:28,431
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie itself kind of was dumb because on one hand, you had a documentary about Hurricane Katrina and then, you know, which was very powerful to see that imagery and impactful, you know, it was obviously a terrible tragedy that happened, you know, you know,

55
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:29,433
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

56
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do women want to strip?

57
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for money and attention.

58
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we could have told you that.

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It really never, for me, it never tied it into why did they feel the need to do it because of Hurricane Katrina or anything like that.

60
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:48,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like I was watching two completely different movies.

61
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:53,187
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably started off making a documentary about strippers and it was just too whatever.

62
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden Hurricane Katrina happened.

63
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:57,609
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, hey, there we go.

64
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we can tie this into it.

65
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are interested in Hurricane Katrina so they will watch our crappy movie.

66
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,335
[SPEAKER_04]: or it will end up free on Netflix someday.

67
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:07,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

68
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not good.

69
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:11,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, don't waste your time with it.

70
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:23,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's like, hey, strippers, or hey, interesting documentary on Hurricane Katrina, but I'm sure there are plenty of more informative documentaries on Hurricane Katrina that are much more powerful than this, which was kind of garbage.

71
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:24,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just garbage.

72
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:25,666
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

73
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I really only played Saints Row 2.

74
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing a lot of Saints Row 2.

75
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:46,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with it.

76
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost 100% complete with the game.

77
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:00,087
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

78
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:19,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't like the new friends list on there.

79
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:23,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's too hard to find, you know, what people are playing at.

80
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,487
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes me forever to scroll through that list.

81
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:32,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas, you know, I can just hit the button, you know, guide button again and just pull up my friends list and it just has a drop down of what people are playing.

82
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can look at it at a glance real quick.

83
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I do like the community games.

84
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:37,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are pretty fun.

85
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:39,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

86
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:48,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like the new shop, how they have it set up with where you can see screenshots and box art and stuff like that for the games.

87
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

88
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:59,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It does seem to be a little harder just to browse stuff sometimes, but I'm just getting used to it.

89
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of my thoughts on it.

90
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love the new features.

91
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: The avatars are cute.

92
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Netflix is awesome.

93
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:09,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Community games are awesome.

94
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:20,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that Microsoft tried to modernize everything, which sounds weird because not only is the Xbox an old system, but they're basically trying to put some of these new stuff in an all-new package.

95
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:21,144
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

96
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,147
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

97
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the... So there's a lot of problems.

98
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say it's a negative thing.

99
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,711
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, NXT overall is a positive thing.

100
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think some things are a little more difficult when they don't need to be.

101
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:18,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like all the advertisements on there.

102
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:26,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, when you first bring it up, it's like what's going on in Xbox and stuff like that, and they have all this crap that I gotta scroll through.

103
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... You know, that's kind of annoying.

104
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:29,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could take that away.

105
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the little intro video when you first install it.

106
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:32,517
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome.

107
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:33,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

108
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:39,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think gold users shouldn't have to see as many of those ads?

109
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

110
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are for their little inside Xbox videos and things.

111
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:47,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind it because it's free stuff.

112
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:48,267
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's not...

113
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:53,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Flash here.

114
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your IQ smarter than Sarah Palin and all the stuff you see on the internet?

115
00:08:57,676 --> 00:08:58,877
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's not that bad.

116
00:08:59,017 --> 00:08:59,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just small gripes.

117
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:07,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, going to the community games, I did play... I tried to play everything on there, or at least a lot of it.

118
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:08,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez.

119
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:09,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It's taking you a while.

120
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:12,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I haven't gotten to play everything.

121
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,830
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it I downloaded and I looked at it again.

122
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like...

123
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I don't want that, you know, I'm just deleting that.

124
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I ended up buying a couple of them.

125
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a Weapon of Choice, which is awesome.

126
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:31,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like a Contra-type game, which is really weird weapons and weird characters and enemies and stuff that you fight.

127
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:32,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that's kind of neat.

128
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:33,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of quirky.

129
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:40,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then the other one, I don't know why I bought it, but it was kind of fun, was, um, I think it was like, um...

130
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:44,686
[SPEAKER_05]: SignSurfing, and that was kind of cool.

131
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:50,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really simple, just a little fun mess around game, which is kind of neat.

132
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:54,768
[SPEAKER_05]: The word puzzle one, I kind of thought about buying that, but I haven't gotten a chance to yet.

133
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just go on there every time I'm on there usually.

134
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,770
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm on there for an extended period of time, I'll look to see the new ones that have come up and stuff like that.

135
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I was complaining before when we were talking to Bobby...

136
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:14,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the graphics, it looks really unpolished.

137
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:20,458
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it looks like the games aren't done and they're just putting them up to see if they can make any money off of them.

138
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:22,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

139
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,521
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really bad.

140
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:31,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Even some of these independent developers and stuff, like some of the Japanese ones, like we've talked about in Warning Forever and

141
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

142
00:10:56,997 --> 00:11:06,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, other than that, like I said, Saints Row 2, playing through that, it's getting to the point now where I'm just doing the 100% stuff so I can finish the entire game.

143
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:13,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing Grand Theft Auto 4 now because everyone got hooked on that because they thought for some reason that...

144
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:15,743
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

146
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

147
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:06,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

148
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:09,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is very sad.

149
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:13,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very sad because they didn't do anything to it.

150
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:20,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, in fact, actually took things out of... If you played the original GameCube one, you'll know that they had a fountain and stuff like that.

151
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you have to buy those things.

152
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:25,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that was the way it was in Wild World.

153
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.

154
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still sad that they took stuff out and they made stuff simpler.

155
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:32,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no reason for it.

156
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:32,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not...

157
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:34,864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

158
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:51,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii for Wii Sports

159
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I laugh every time I see the commercial.

160
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I hear there's a new boutique in town.

161
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:16,806
[SPEAKER_05]: God, you're stupid!

162
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:21,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, are you excited about a store in a fictional city in a game?

163
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on!

164
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can appreciate what Nintendo's trying to do.

165
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:35,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even though they have gotten pigeonholed as the casual game company and the one that's catering to women, and rightfully so, let's face it, they're selling like crazy.

166
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:59,189
[SPEAKER_05]: and if it helps enable more people that usually wouldn't play games to play games I'm okay with it I'm okay with Nintendo reaching out to a different audience as gay as it might make you feel okay well here's the thing though is their games like as of after Mario Kart basically that's come out all the games have been released by Nintendo haven't sold very well and

167
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been going downhill fast.

168
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially the fourth quarter stuff.

169
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Wario Land Shake It, surprisingly, didn't sell very well.

170
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii Music, well, we don't even need to go there.

171
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:13,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And Animal Crossing, surprisingly, not that big of a seller.

172
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:17,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just people realize that they haven't changed anything.

173
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people that don't realize it are the people that probably aren't going to buy it anyways.

174
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:21,956
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the overall picture?

175
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:25,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the pool's getting pretty diluted out there when you look at all the third-party titles.

176
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is it just because...

177
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: People that would have bought Animal Crossing are instead tempted by these cheaper budget games that are shovelware?

178
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so, because there's nothing really competing with those genres of games.

179
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:40,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Wario Land Shaky doesn't really have any good side-scrolling platformers that are competing with it.

180
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:45,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii Music, maybe Guitar Hero would have competed with it, but I think Wii Music was bad to begin with.

181
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:54,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And Animal Crossing, really the only thing that kind of compares to it that came out around the same time is My Sims Kingdom, which sold even worse than, you know, Animal Crossing.

182
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:55,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't think...

183
00:14:56,124 --> 00:15:00,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you'll do pretty well, but right now they haven't given us any hope to...

184
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:03,613
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing really different.

185
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.

186
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh my god.

187
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to read some comments from chat here.

188
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:13,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com, of course, always our other guest here on the program.

189
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:17,478
[SPEAKER_04]: The fourth guest, or tonight, they've been promoted to third guest because DarkSakura's not here tonight.

190
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:21,200
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says, how do we know City Folk isn't selling well?

191
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,120
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have an MPD.

192
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have a little kind of an insider perspective on it.

193
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just from what I've seen.

194
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:26,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could be selling very well.

195
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,603
[SPEAKER_04]: On a grander scale, but from what you are seeing, it is not.

196
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:32,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're selling out, but it's just not...

197
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,816
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't that many to begin with.

198
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:59,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo's made a lot of very disappointing decisions in the past two years.

199
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:03,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that has affected the hardcore gamers like you and me.

200
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:07,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just kind of goes right into what Acidic Vampire says in chat.

201
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is reaching out to other people but neglecting the hardcore gamers frown.

202
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of my issue.

203
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:15,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole thing... Right there.

204
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:24,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and my thing was, too, is before with the GameCube, when they were done with the GameCube and they're developing the Wii and they're promoting the Wii, it's like, listen, the Wii is for everybody.

205
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:32,087
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii system is not... We're not going to be pigeonholed in being known as a company that puts out games only for children.

206
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,849
[SPEAKER_05]: We are trying to appeal to everybody.

207
00:16:34,912 --> 00:17:03,125
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're not they're just doing the same thing that they've been doing before they're just complaining that everyone sees them as a company that puts out you know games for like you know too many family games and too many uh just casual games and well complain all you want but that's what you're doing and here's here's the other thing too i can respect what nintendo does from a business perspective which is what i'm kind of saying with these commercials and things it's like you know as a business move it's it's a smart idea and it's something new but at the same time on a personal level i can still kind of go but it sucks

208
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:04,186
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

209
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:24,540
[SPEAKER_04]: and hardcore gamers kind of push the Wii to be so in demand in the first place.

210
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:37,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo's going to need them if they launch another system or an upgraded version of the Wii, which is kind of my fear is what's going to happen is that we're going to see the next system that comes out of Nintendo is going to be, and it could be as soon as next year, maybe 2010.

211
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say no later than 2010, you're going to see it Wii HD or something where Nintendo

212
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:52,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're going to start catering into all those features, you know, but their big selling point is going to be, but it's also a Wii, just like the Wii was also a GameCube, you know what I mean?

213
00:17:53,016 --> 00:18:07,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think to get that support, they're going to need to win us hardcore gamers back, and the more you push us away, and the more that Xbox and even now Sony starts to woo us over, which who would have thought that would have happened a few years ago, that we'd be talking...

214
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:20,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So great about Sony, but whereas Nintendo's been making a lot of disappointing decisions this year, Sony's been making a lot of I can't say great decisions, but satisfying decisions.

215
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:20,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it that way.

216
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,796
[SPEAKER_04]: We're content with Sony right now.

217
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:24,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just put it this way.

218
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:29,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what's coming up for the first two months of 2009 from Nintendo, and it's sad.

219
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's sad if you own a Wii.

220
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:32,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it that way.

221
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,181
[SPEAKER_05]: If you own a DS, you might not be so disappointed, but

222
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:41,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, this is the trend that they're doing now is let's start remaking GameCube games.

223
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you put any less effort into that?

224
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:45,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

225
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:54,501
[SPEAKER_05]: What, we got Play for Wii Mario Tennis and Play for Wii Pikmin is the first two games of next year for the Wii.

226
00:18:57,297 --> 00:18:57,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

227
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:58,598
[SPEAKER_04]: With Pikmin!

228
00:18:58,698 --> 00:18:59,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome!

229
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Pikmin all over again!

230
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're gonna get to a story later tonight about that there's a surprise cooking over at Nintendo, one of their developers.

231
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible that Nintendo is setting the stage to really knock our socks off next E3?

232
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They better.

233
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:16,392
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

234
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling next E3 it's gonna be about the DSi.

235
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:21,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And I...

236
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that they do something good because, man, my bar for them is set so low right now, it's like, there's very little, maybe a new Zelda game, or F-Zero or something.

237
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that Kid Icarus game that's been rumored for a long, long time.

238
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:40,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll never happen.

239
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:43,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just saying, you want to win me back, here's some ways.

240
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And they gotta be good, they can't be shovelware.

241
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You shovelware Kid Icarus, I'm gonna be pissed.

242
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna be twice as pissed as I was before.

243
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta make it good.

244
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:55,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stop being so stingy is what they need to do.

245
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says the thing is that the core gamer and the third party has abandoned Nintendo.

246
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:09,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to get to one of the stories later tonight about how some of these companies are now starting to say, look, we're just not capable of doing what we wanted to do, so bye.

247
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the core gamer's finicky, okay?

248
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:14,316
[SPEAKER_04]: If they come out with a really kick-ass game, they're going to come right back, okay?

249
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So it...

250
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

251
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:57,678
[SPEAKER_04]: interview in look into as to why do game blogs and even podcasters like us and so on find the need to nitpick the negative in every single game out there and I think it's centered around Mirror's Edge and how Mirror's Edge is really getting these reviews that are just all over the map you know some people are giving it oh my god best game ever etc etc and some people are saying and just really nitpicking the shit out of the game you know are people doing it just to

252
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Be negative on something.

253
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:03,794
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, fucking Power Trip is what they are.

254
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,855
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting treated like royalty, getting promo shit sent to them.

255
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,397
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting basically blown by these game companies.

256
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:15,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're just like, oh, well, this game isn't as good as blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

257
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and this is why I'm going to... You know, just like complain about little shit.

258
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:23,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably because they're... You know, this is so ironic coming from you.

259
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:52,816
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know what though I find fun in different things I mean like Earth Defense Force perfect example that game is absolute shit if you were to look at it like by you know graphics AI everything is god damn retarded in that game but it's fun and that's the whole point is that's really all that counts is if the game is fun who gives a crap if it's ugly it's fun that's the whole point but you just were sitting here dogging on the community games for having crappy graphics but they aren't fun either

260
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:55,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, alright then, alright, fine.

261
00:21:55,317 --> 00:22:04,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And seriously though, I mean, there are lines that, you know, can be crossed, you know, where it's like, okay, yeah, it might be fun, but seriously, man, that looks awful.

262
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:06,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, I don't know.

263
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:09,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other games you've been playing this week?

264
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:11,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of gotten on all these tangents, but it's been fine.

265
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:13,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other games you've been playing this week?

266
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:14,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

267
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:19,661
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I've been using my PS3 as a Blu-ray player quite a bit.

268
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Kung Fu Panda is pretty awesome.

269
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:23,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

270
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Mamma Mia is coming out pretty soon, and Dark Knight, and SingStar ABBA.

271
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:30,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

272
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,612
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3 is this week, isn't it?

273
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:33,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I believe it is.

274
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:34,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited.

275
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:52,268
[SPEAKER_05]: well I was it I um someone had mentioned like I have pre-ordered right now one of the limited editions of Dark Knight with the stupid bat pod things I want a piece of crap for my desk you know like right now cool things to put on it so I will see if I actually buy that but

276
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:55,255
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, games I've been playing this week.

277
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:57,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, you know, same old stuff.

278
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:58,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about Netflix.

279
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I did dive into community games.

280
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:01,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up Snake360.

281
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had Aaron on last week who was really the dude behind Snake360.

282
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:07,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I had a good time with Snake360.

283
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:16,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like that Aaron has pushed the limits of everything that you can kind of possibly do within the confines of what community games lets you do.

284
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:20,269
[SPEAKER_04]: All these different modes, all these different maps

285
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:50,149
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really kind of done a lot that you can do with this game when it comes to having the multiplayer, having the timed mode, having the pick up a certain number of pods in a level mode, having the different mazes.

286
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:58,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the soundtrack, it was really smart of him to pair up with Kyle Ward and his company and have the music because it

287
00:23:58,718 --> 00:23:59,519
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

288
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,219
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that Microsoft just plain won't let him do.

289
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But I worry for community games as a whole because I think there's going to be a lot of people that don't know so much about, you know, well, community games have all these restrictions to them.

290
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:35,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And like he can't do online leaderboards because Microsoft won't let him.

291
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, he's found a lot of very creative workarounds.

292
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:39,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give him that.

293
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:43,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of achievements, he has goals and the goals will unlock things.

294
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of the leaderboards, he has the online leaderboards where you go and put in the codes.

295
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

296
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:46,491
[SPEAKER_04]: you probably won't enjoy the game but I think as a local multiplayer especially is a lot of fun I crave it to be on Xbox Live and I'm kind of disappointed Microsoft won't let some of these games go to the next level I hope they will I hope some of these really good you know impressing community games such as you know Weapon to Choice I think is doing very well you mentioned it earlier and Bobby had the dude on his show tonight from Weapon to Choice maybe some of these guys will get to upgrade if they want to a full-on game I don't know

297
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:49,904
[SPEAKER_04]: SuperStreetFighter2 Turbo HD Remix

298
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:06,231
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

299
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:23,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same game you've had already!

300
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:34,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you already know this about Street Fighter 2, but to me it's a little bit insulting that they would charge $10 for that first game and then come around a year later and charge $10 for essentially the same game.

301
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:34,459
$15.

302
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, an additional $5 or whatever you want to say for this game.

303
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:43,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I realize Street Fighter 2 is a classic, but at the same time...

304
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:52,881
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only so much you can do with it, and I think Street Fighter 4 is more of what, in my opinion, a redone Street Fighter 2 ought to be.

305
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:53,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Street Fighter 4.

306
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:55,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

307
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:59,086
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you get in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix that you didn't have before?

308
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:08,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same game with four new characters, of which, give or take, in my opinion, I guess I like Fei Long, but I don't know.

309
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:09,235
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of give or take.

310
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't worth the five bucks to me.

311
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:11,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Or...

312
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:15,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that and then there's the new graphics and the new sound.

313
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:17,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rebalancing.

314
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:18,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say something here.

315
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:22,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the rebalancing for a casual fighter person like me is irrelevant.

316
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,260
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics aren't bad.

317
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it that.

318
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,820
[SPEAKER_04]: The HD is pretty cool.

319
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The sprites are done fairly well.

320
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's not a smooth game because you still have...

321
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:35,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

322
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,741
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

323
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:30,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what they tried to do with Street Fighter 2 I appreciate that they tried to go to the indie community and this OC remix thing and they actually got people to remix the songs but for me they don't work they don't match the mood of the original songs at all and I could tell this from the minute the character select screen came up I was like what did they do to the character select music this is awful

324
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:49,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, I know that statement's probably not going to make me popular amongst fans of the OC Remix circuit, and it's not to say that website hasn't done a lot of great things in the past, but I think it's left best these tracks that made it into this game as Remix, and I realize it's a whole play on that word, Remix, and da-da-da-da-da.

325
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:52,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But it didn't work in the game at all for me.

326
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And sound to me is very, very important in the game and the music.

327
00:28:56,562 --> 00:29:03,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're going to try and rate me for $15 more based on nostalgia, I want my tunes to have some sense of nostalgia.

328
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:09,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I realize I can revert to classic mode, but again, what are you trying to sell me?

329
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:14,395
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just wanted to sell me the classic songs, you already sold that to me a year ago.

330
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So I expect that these remixes are going to have some type of... Maybe I'm just bothered because I've heard remixes of these songs before that were more true to the originals and that were better for me.

331
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:28,914
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did not like the soundtrack at all.

332
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:36,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Call me names, tell me I'm hatin' if you want, but in this particular circumstance, I did not like the music.

333
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

334
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:40,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a real big fan of Street Fighter 2 anyway, so I didn't even look at it.

335
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:44,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, eh, 15 bucks, screw that.

336
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:45,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to buy it.

337
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:47,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to buy the original either.

338
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if they came out with yet another Bionic Commando game, then yes, I would probably...

339
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they are afraid if people check out this game, they're going to realize it's a waste of their money.

340
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not enough here besides the continued whoring of your nostalgia.

341
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:31,965
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I feel like I've been through that enough in the past two years thanks to Nintendo.

342
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:33,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

343
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:34,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta give them credit.

344
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,589
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the sprites look good.

345
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:39,232
[SPEAKER_05]: They put the effort into the graphics of the game and stuff.

346
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just blurry.

347
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:41,914
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

348
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:51,975
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, really, if you're not really... If you bought the first one on Xbox Live, you probably don't need to buy this either.

349
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:56,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, don't bother with it on Xbox at all if you don't have the right controller.

350
00:30:56,718 --> 00:31:07,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to play this game with a regular Xbox 360 controller unless you have somehow been able to overcome that whole... I'm telling you, every bad thing you hear about the Xbox 360 controller is true for this.

351
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't.

352
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:15,738
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have to get it get it on PlayStation Network for the controller alone unless you have an arcade stick on 360 or something

353
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, folks in chat are completely disagreeing, which is fine.

354
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:23,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of expected that.

355
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:30,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun says, but really, STHD is the definitive Street Fighter now, even more so than Street Fighter 4.

356
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,028
[SPEAKER_04]: All fighting game players need to buy it.

357
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:36,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Acidic Vampire says, that's what some movie studios do.

358
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,413
[SPEAKER_04]: When they know a movie's going to suck, they don't release it to the press for advanced reviews.

359
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:40,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the weird thing.

360
00:31:40,354 --> 00:31:42,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the game overall is getting good reviews.

361
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:45,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize I'm... And I'm not doing it for the sake of going against it.

362
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I just personally... I did not like it.

363
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:47,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

364
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,500
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not sorry.

365
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it.

366
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:50,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Deal with it.

367
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:56,306
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's another thing, too, is this whole game review stuff, because they remember this all just like Chrono Trigger and stuff.

368
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,167
[SPEAKER_05]: No offense.

369
00:31:57,187 --> 00:32:05,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Chrono Trigger is an awesome game and stuff, but they didn't really do too much to the DS game, and it's getting almost perfect scores and stuff.

370
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:06,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird.

371
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:09,699
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is Chrono Trigger, so it's pretty awesome.

372
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:09,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

373
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:21,798
[SPEAKER_04]: See, then HitStun goes on to say, if you don't have a 360, and I might be taking this out of context, I apologize, says, if you don't have a 360 or PS3, it's a good reason to buy the console just to get the game.

374
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:24,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, do I disagree with that comment.

375
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,521
[SPEAKER_04]: If the game in question is Street Fighter, because it's really not.

376
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

377
00:32:52,690 --> 00:33:01,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really priced them lately or at all, but I would be willing to bet you could probably get a full-size arcade cabinet with Street Fighter 2.

378
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:04,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably wouldn't be that expensive.

379
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:05,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that would be my guess.

380
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:08,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the original Street Fighter 2 or whatever.

381
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,560
[SPEAKER_05]: You might even be able to get it for just slightly more than $400.

382
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:19,203
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're really that insane that you'd buy a console for a freaking downloadable game.

383
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:20,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's weird.

384
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:26,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a comment that will piss off the Street Fighter fans even further.

385
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:29,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this I will say just for the sake of pissing people off.

386
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:30,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll admit this.

387
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:36,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing Street Fighter 2 HD Remix almost made me want to go buy Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

388
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:38,646
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how much I did not enjoy the game.

389
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,828
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not right.

390
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:42,270
[SPEAKER_04]: You think that's taking it too far?

391
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's taking it too far.

392
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:44,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking it too far?

393
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:48,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting yelled at by chat for that comment.

394
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty bad.

395
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:17,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look.

396
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:20,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some of tonight's game news.

397
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, see, here's what I'm saying right here.

398
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:25,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2, you can get a Street Fighter Alpha 2 arcade cabinet, $600.

399
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:33,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So you better believe that you can get an original Street Fighter 2 machine, yeah, literally about $600.

400
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So just, if you're really that insane that you would buy a console for this, seriously, just go buy the real arcade game.

401
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,242
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

402
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:49,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, before we get to some gaming news tonight, let's talk about some housekeeping tonight.

403
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:52,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a contest soon to give away the code for Banjo-Kazooie.

404
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,162
[SPEAKER_04]: We were supposed to do it last week, but we're going to retool it to be something that both our live and our podcast listeners can do.

405
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:02,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not going to be doing it tonight, but there will be something probably next week.

406
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:08,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll kind of give you more details on that when everybody's back and when it's not the holidays.

407
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:10,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Also...

408
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:16,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have a lot else to talk about in housekeeping tonight.

409
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:20,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the stuff with our Facebook, of course.

410
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:25,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We have OL Army on Facebook, MySpace at username Orange Lounge Radio, and LiveJournal at Orange Lounge.

411
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:32,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So, unless you can think of anything for housekeeping tonight as far as news goes, but not a lot going on with the show otherwise.

412
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Same old, same old.

413
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:35,897
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the...

414
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:42,479
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can't think of anything other than Burger King Tender Crisp sandwiches aren't that great.

415
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

416
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,261
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to get into the news tonight.

417
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:47,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, before we get into the news tonight.

418
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually do our little thing on Bobby's show before we go live.

419
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:58,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf, the man who we follow on All Games Radio Live Sunday nights.

420
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:02,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys heard it, but there was some weird little cryptic message.

421
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:06,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to ask Bobby about it, but he's totally ignoring my text.

422
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm trying to figure out what that website was.

423
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:10,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, did you guys hear it?

424
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:14,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something like FLive.net or something?

425
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:15,577
[SPEAKER_04]: FNG Live?

426
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:18,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't hear it all, but I don't know.

427
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to go back and download it and check it out.

428
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Something weird going on.

429
00:36:23,652 --> 00:36:24,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into the news.

430
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And tell Bobby to stop ignoring me.

431
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,754
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very rude, Bobby.

432
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm calling you out.

433
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:32,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

434
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:32,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you start off?

435
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:39,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, a couple weeks ago, the brand new download content for Grand Theft Auto 4 was announced.

436
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:45,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto's Lost and the Damned, or Lost and Damned, I guess.

437
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is going to revolve around the biker gang that was in Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost.

438
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And would be a brand new thing.

439
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess a brand new story mode.

440
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:58,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't really add anything like I wanted to it, like tanks and crap, but...

441
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, new story, sweet.

442
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:06,554
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going to be released in February.

443
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:19,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, though, what's interesting is GameStop has the download content available to purchase on their website, which is supposed to be released in February on the 17th.

444
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And so apparently you'll be able to buy this redemption card at GameStop.

445
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:28,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, talk about a way to whore that out, but...

446
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:33,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a hint folks, if you go to GameStop you're going to pay sales tax.

447
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,891
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy it online you're not going to have to pay sales tax.

448
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:38,354
[SPEAKER_05]: At least you shouldn't have to pay a sales tax.

449
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:40,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't buy it from GameStop.

450
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty easy right there.

451
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:46,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't some states charge you sales tax even on the download stuff?

452
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:48,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in that case, it doesn't matter then.

453
00:37:49,237 --> 00:37:54,538
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, it costs you gas to drive down the GameStop.

454
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:56,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Gas is cheap right now.

455
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you noticed?

456
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,580
[SPEAKER_04]: In the two weeks we've been off, gas dropped a dollar.

457
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

458
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a cost.

459
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:08,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And even after all that, it's just to buy a code that you would enter in to download it anyway.

460
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So just save yourself the time.

461
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:11,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Save them the...

462
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:15,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Ego of being able to pre-order cards.

463
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's sad.

464
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go buy it online.

465
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you even need to buy the game sub?

466
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:26,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe it's just the convenience.

467
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:27,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

468
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:29,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, when is this coming out?

469
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: February.

470
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

471
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:32,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say so people could buy it as a Christmas present.

472
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,282
[SPEAKER_05]: No, so they can pre-order more stuff.

473
00:38:34,322 --> 00:38:40,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can get you to turn in some games as a pre-order download content so they can get another five bucks from you.

474
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:49,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but the fact that you would pay for download content at a store and then go home and download it is just stupid.

475
00:38:51,516 --> 00:38:53,217
[SPEAKER_05]: According to me, I mean, what do I know, though?

476
00:38:54,437 --> 00:38:57,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe somebody doesn't have internet capability or what have you.

477
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you wouldn't buy the download content!

478
00:38:58,738 --> 00:38:59,558
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't a disc!

479
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:02,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a card with a code that you enter it in online and download it!

480
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid!

481
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, fine.

482
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely retarded.

483
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Zushi says free poster at GameStop.

484
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

485
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Free poster!

486
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:17,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, if they've got a free poster, then I better go down there right now.

487
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:19,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I can't do the rest of the show.

488
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to get my free poster.

489
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look, look, look.

490
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I like free things.

491
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:27,994
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I would be probably one of the three people who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

492
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:40,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you actually want to order Grand Theft Auto 4, a pre-order, if you want to do it for your PC, order Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, you can actually get a free copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City just for placing the pre-order.

493
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all via Steam, so Valve and Rockstar Games teamed up, and if you pre-order Grand Theft Auto 4 PC via Steam, then Vice City will be free.

494
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:53,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's awesome.

495
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, you've got to do it right now, because Grand Theft Auto 4 releases, like, what, Tuesday on PC?

496
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:06,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome, except Anna Dreyas was way better anyways, and Vice City this time is really old.

497
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:07,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

498
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:10,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Just buy Grand Theft Auto 4.

499
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,814
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need extra stuff for it.

500
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:28,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, speaking of other things, Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC has the ever infamous secure ROM in it now.

501
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:33,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully though, there's not going to be as much limitation as some of these other games.

502
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:41,251
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no limit on concurrent installations, but you will have to authenticate it once you've installed it.

503
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:46,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll have to, I guess, authenticate it again if you reinstall it.

504
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:54,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically just to make sure that the CD-ROM, I guess, is... I don't know, in your drive when you're playing the game or something like that.

505
00:40:54,678 --> 00:40:55,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Something stupid.

506
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't help but think this is probably going to be cracked next week already.

507
00:41:02,523 --> 00:41:06,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Secure ROM has really been no obstacle for a lot of people...

508
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, it's quite a controversial thing.

509
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:14,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not just the limited installations is pissing people off, but the whole, you know, that whole thing.

510
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:21,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know whether you would call it a rumor if it's a proven fact or what, but the whole like, you know, that it might screw up your drive.

511
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I already have it installed in my system and nothing's messed up so far.

512
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it doesn't really matter for me.

513
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:32,756
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I'm not buying the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.

514
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:36,540
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya relays an interesting comment.

515
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:39,123
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, it's like I told the people at GamePolitics.

516
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:44,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering how hard Securom is to get rid of, I'd rather take my chances with Trojans and Keyloggers.

517
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:52,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You just, you know, have a trusted place to download your wares, I guess.

518
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so, although you shouldn't be advocating piracy.

519
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:59,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we should necessarily be advocating secure ROM either.

520
00:41:59,322 --> 00:42:00,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not advocating piracy.

521
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:04,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC.

522
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you already have it on 360.

523
00:42:05,263 --> 00:42:07,363
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you need it on PC for, right?

524
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:11,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC.

525
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:13,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, because I do have it.

526
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:14,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already finished it.

527
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:21,606
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason for me to actually play this on PC other than it looks prettier and, well, you know, I do have a game PC now.

528
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I might as well put games on it.

529
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:23,706
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

530
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I got you.

531
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just looking forward to all the hacking.

532
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:30,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

533
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:32,095
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm looking forward to.

534
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Can Securum prevent that?

535
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:39,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think that they wouldn't bother because that's kind of the reason why people get it on PC is to screw with it?

536
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:46,207
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not going to affect it at all because Securum only really protects the main executable for it.

537
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:51,792
[SPEAKER_05]: All the data files are what's going to be modified to whatever you want to do with it.

538
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:54,078
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

539
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, PETA did a little spoof on Cookie Mama.

540
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:27,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they don't really care about people's trademarks or anything like that because it's parody, but I mean, seriously, it's just... It was really just an overall excuse to get people to watch the video that's embedded there.

541
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:32,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Majesco had a really cute response to it where they actually quoted Mama, and I thought that was very cute what they did.

542
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:37,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as PETA goes, love them or hate them, there ain't...

543
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:39,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working.

544
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:41,232
[SPEAKER_04]: People are talking about it.

545
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:49,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you what, probably hundreds and thousands of people saw that video that wouldn't have before simply because it did tie into video games.

546
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So love them or hate them, they did what they had to do.

547
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:55,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And it worked for all intents and purposes, I suppose.

548
00:43:57,057 --> 00:44:02,438
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I don't necessarily agree... It's not that I don't agree with PETA 100%, but...

549
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:07,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say Majesco had a very cute response to it and props to them

550
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that there was another story that I think is kind of big.

551
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: The story kind of got blown over a little bit.

552
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:39,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Eidos, once again back in the spotlight, for trying to fix their Metacritic scores for Tomb Raider Underworld.

553
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:43,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they sort of blew...

554
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

555
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

556
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the first time I've heard of something like that, though.

557
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the first time I've heard of the Metacritic spin on it, but I've definitely heard of companies saying, like, you know, well, what review are you going to give it?

558
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:39,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, if you're going to give it a high review, then you can post it early.

559
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:40,940
[SPEAKER_04]: You can break the embargo.

560
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're not going to give it a high review, then you have to wait until, you know, the street date.

561
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of messed up, and there's probably a good reason why that a low review might be, you know, warrant this game.

562
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,231
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently the Tomb Raider Underworld version for the Wii,

563
00:45:58,553 --> 00:45:59,634
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

564
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,999
[SPEAKER_04]: How do they give you a save?

565
00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:32,060
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go download it off the internet.

566
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because I'm sure everybody can just do that.

567
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:34,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

568
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:36,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really annoying.

569
00:46:36,882 --> 00:46:37,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

570
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:40,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of trying to check out the Metacritic scores.

571
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:43,324
[SPEAKER_04]: 78 is the current score on the PlayStation 3 version.

572
00:46:43,344 --> 00:46:44,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

573
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:46,226
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a bad score, all things considered.

574
00:46:46,246 --> 00:46:46,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the Wii version.

575
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:47,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii version has a 68.

576
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:49,567
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too bad.

577
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:52,728
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually not a horrible score.

578
00:46:52,808 --> 00:46:54,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the yellow, but it's...

579
00:46:56,238 --> 00:46:57,239
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

580
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: A 28.

581
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:12,496
[SPEAKER_05]: A 28.

582
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Party 2 Midway Lawn Darts Beanbags Horseshoes Shit Game

583
00:48:04,494 --> 00:48:06,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unoriginal, it's also dirt cheap.

584
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $20, and that sold actually pretty well, from what I remember.

585
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:16,325
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's $20 that, honestly, you know, despite all the crap I gave it earlier, it's $20 that's better spent on Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix.

586
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:26,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, you know, despite the hard time I gave Street Fighter 2, I mean, it still is Street Fighter 2, which is better than, like, 80% of the Wii games out there right now.

587
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:27,996
[SPEAKER_04]: If not more.

588
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the other stuff from last week.

589
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:39,372
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a new update to the Wii that broke the Twilight hack and all that stuff.

590
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:43,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And also targeted modded save files and some other stuff.

591
00:48:45,114 --> 00:48:48,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently, yeah, it was, you know, bad.

592
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:56,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it did enhance, though, is it added, I guess, the ability to use USB keyboards in the Mi Channel or something like that for when you're typing stuff.

593
00:48:57,337 --> 00:48:58,578
[SPEAKER_05]: What's funny, though, is it got...

594
00:48:59,498 --> 00:49:27,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Rebroken again a few days later by hackers and they released a new version of the Twilight update or the Twilight hack that allowed you to install the Homebrew channel but still though thanks for trying and then finally one last thing a couple things that were kind of interesting new arcade games and Guitar Hero apparently is coming to the arcade and the weirdest part about it is Konami's helping them

595
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:29,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

596
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:49,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, they've got a little bit of experience there.

597
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,297
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be some online functionality with it.

598
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:58,940
[SPEAKER_05]: No word if they're going to actually have any additional songs or if it's just going to be stuff from Guitar Hero 3.

599
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,884
[SPEAKER_05]: But the hardware itself looks like kind of the World Tour guitars but with arcade parts.

600
00:50:08,248 --> 00:50:15,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So look, for those essentially that were hoping that Konami would one day bring Guitar Freaks out to the US, forget it.

601
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:16,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

602
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:17,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.

603
00:50:19,598 --> 00:50:30,749
[SPEAKER_04]: These folks at Activision and Neversoft, well I guess you can't say Neversoft, but Activision and so forth and Red Octane have their mouths firmly planted on Konami's cock where it ought to be.

604
00:50:31,489 --> 00:50:34,771
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's kind of where the idea came from in the first place, one could argue.

605
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:42,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And Konami likes it and they're getting theirs from it, so it's a win-win deal all around.

606
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:43,915
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it's going to be.

607
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:45,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it or leave it.

608
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:54,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course they say that that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be a Guitar Freaks game, but that basically means that there's not going to be a Guitar Freaks game, I mean, more or less.

609
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Then all the other games that were being shown off as well, American Idol, they're going to have a

610
00:51:00,382 --> 00:51:01,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress

611
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:30,835
[SPEAKER_05]: EA apparently is teaming up with GameStop and it's an idea that they're throwing around right now.

612
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:34,418
[SPEAKER_05]: They're offering people a season pass.

613
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:35,919
[SPEAKER_05]: According to a...

614
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:46,766
[SPEAKER_05]: survey that's been sent out, they were throwing out the idea of having an EA Sports season pass where someone would buy this for, say, a $20 enrollment fee.

615
00:51:46,826 --> 00:51:53,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And what would it do is it would cut 33% of the cost from all EA Sports games that were purchased in that year.

616
00:51:54,332 --> 00:52:01,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you bought the pass and you say you're a person that buys the Maddens, the NCAA football, and all that stuff, you would save 33% off each game.

617
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:25,348
[SPEAKER_05]: which I mean it's not a bad deal if you think about it because you're actually saving you know 20 bucks a game about so if you buy a lot of games or if you even buy one game with this deal I mean it's worth it to do it because you actually break even with the first game and then you start saving money with the second game but once again they get you to buy more than one game so

618
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,958
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the solution for a weakening economy, I suppose.

619
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:32,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Get you hooked in early.

620
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Season pass.

621
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's how it's going to go.

622
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:40,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, see, here's the other thing about the season pass.

623
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:49,530
[SPEAKER_05]: You say, for example, you may have bought NBA 2K10 or whatever next year.

624
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:55,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now, say if you buy the season pass for Madden or something like that, and you're thinking about buying an NBA game...

625
00:52:56,595 --> 00:52:56,815
[SPEAKER_05]: True, true.

626
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:03,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

627
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:08,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll see how this plays out, but I'm not much of a sports game fan, so it's not like it's a deal I'm going to take.

628
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:17,041
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know there are people out there that might just want to jump on the deal, because a deal is a deal, and if you are a person that buys these games, this isn't necessarily bad news.

629
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:21,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you are a person that buys sports games, think about it this way.

630
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:22,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Get with your friends.

631
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:28,488
[SPEAKER_05]: One person buys that, or chip in for the season pass, and you just have one person buy all your games.

632
00:53:29,048 --> 00:53:29,408
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

633
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:29,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

634
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:30,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Save a lot of money.

635
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:31,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Work the system.

636
00:53:31,569 --> 00:53:33,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is actually going to happen, but we'll see.

637
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,671
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

638
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,671
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see what happens.

639
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:37,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

640
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:38,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like it was a pretty busy week last week.

641
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:39,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

642
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:45,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I was spending my gaming time watching Netflix on the 360, and I watched a documentary about gay bars in Mississippi.

643
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:47,016
[SPEAKER_04]: No kidding.

644
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:49,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, they have everything.

645
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:52,018
[SPEAKER_04]: They have documentaries on everything on Netflix.

646
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:53,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.

647
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:56,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I started a documentary about Walmart.

648
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:13,417
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my biggest problem.

649
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:14,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's just the one here.

650
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:17,079
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so I thought I'd check out the documentary.

651
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:18,540
[SPEAKER_04]: The documentary is on everything.

652
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:19,721
[SPEAKER_04]: On Netflix.

653
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:20,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.

654
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:20,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

655
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:25,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we were talking a little bit about Street Fighter 2 during our gaming week.

656
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:27,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's interesting.

657
00:54:27,886 --> 00:54:32,610
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of coincided with the Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

658
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,291
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually doing a lot of different promotional stuff.

659
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:37,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You may remember with Pinball FX.

660
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a special table for it.

661
00:54:38,874 --> 00:54:41,836
[SPEAKER_05]: They have special themes out for Xbox.

662
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:45,737
[SPEAKER_05]: and your Xbox Dashboard.

663
00:54:45,837 --> 00:54:47,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's some on the PlayStation Network as well.

664
00:54:48,238 --> 00:54:58,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also coming to your favorite sack puppet game, LittleBigPlanet is getting four Street Fighter 2 skins.

665
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:04,383
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have a Chun-Li, a Guile, looks like Zangief, and Ryu.

666
00:55:05,243 --> 00:55:20,121
[SPEAKER_05]: and those are all going to be available soon apparently it's actually been leaked out but they have the pictures online and I'd say that's pretty conclusive if you ask me but you know matter of time before these are released I could see maybe even next week so

667
00:55:21,971 --> 00:55:22,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Got any?

668
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:27,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure they're going to be probably about like five bucks or something.

669
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:28,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're usually about two bucks a skin.

670
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:32,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know how I feel about paying for the LittleBigPlanet skins.

671
00:55:32,815 --> 00:55:33,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

672
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:34,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little silly.

673
00:55:34,796 --> 00:55:35,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I just download all the free ones.

674
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:37,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I download the free ones too.

675
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:39,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get the turkey stuck on your head?

676
00:55:39,578 --> 00:55:41,059
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I forgot to get that one.

677
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:43,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the Venus Flytrap one.

678
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:43,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the last one I remember getting.

679
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,721
[SPEAKER_05]: They also have one that's a TV stuck on their head.

680
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:50,163
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I haven't played a lot of LittleBigPlanet lately thanks to World of Warcraft.

681
00:55:50,203 --> 00:55:50,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know.

682
00:55:51,604 --> 00:55:52,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

683
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:17,488
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

684
00:56:30,188 --> 00:56:37,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go out on Black Friday I went out to breakfast on Black Friday and we had a hard time trying to find a place to park in the damn parking lot and you know what it was a parking lot for?

685
00:56:52,888 --> 00:56:53,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Mervins!

686
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:55,310
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's big about Mervins?

687
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:57,172
[SPEAKER_04]: They all went out of business.

688
00:56:58,112 --> 00:57:01,355
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not even doing anything for Black Friday except further liquidations.

689
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:07,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to a theme park for Black Friday and I actually had a lot of freaking fun.

690
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:11,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fairly empty and I got to ride some pretty awesome coasters.

691
00:57:11,343 --> 00:57:14,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you from SoCal, X2 is awesome.

692
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:15,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to get that out there.

693
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:16,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, sorry.

694
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:22,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about more gaming news.

695
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:26,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I did dog on the soundtrack for Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, but you know what?

696
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:36,014
[SPEAKER_04]: The people at OC Remix do a lot of great remixes, and although I didn't enjoy these remixes in the particular game, I think these might be kind of fun to listen to outside of the game.

697
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:40,917
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to, you can download the remix soundtrack for free!

698
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:43,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available right there at Overclocked Remix.

699
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:47,380
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go over to ocremix.org you can download the soundtrack for free.

700
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

701
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the hard time I gave this game earlier, it is very hard to complain about something that's free.

702
00:57:53,022 --> 00:57:56,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So props to all these folks who spent their time putting it together.

703
00:57:56,704 --> 00:57:59,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't get too mad at me because I dogged it in the game earlier.

704
00:58:00,106 --> 00:58:01,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it's a good thing they're putting it out there for free.

705
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:04,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks guys.

706
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:13,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, speaking of Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, if you live in Europe, you have a little more time to think about whether you want to purchase it or not, especially if you're a PlayStation owner.

707
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:19,301
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries for you Xbox 360 folks, but the game was delayed on PlayStation Network.

708
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:26,022
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released in North America as scheduled the day before it came out on Xbox 360.

709
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:31,144
[SPEAKER_04]: European 360 owners hopefully got the game a little late.

710
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:33,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it actually ended up coming out at all.

711
00:58:34,204 --> 00:58:37,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully somebody in chat can clarify it, but it was delayed there in Europe.

712
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:39,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny now that I think of it.

713
00:58:39,226 --> 00:58:40,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've got it by now, just so you know.

714
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:59,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was just saying, I was wondering why they were releasing the PlayStation 3 version a day before the Xbox 360, but now that we think about it, that they don't have a demo for the PS3 version, people don't know that it sucks.

715
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:04,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, that kind of goes back to your theory that that's why they kind of rushed the demo for it.

716
00:59:05,617 --> 00:59:08,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, you know, one extra day without the demo, people can't try it and...

717
00:59:10,891 --> 00:59:16,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's necessarily that Capcom thinks the game sucks because it's getting good reviews.

718
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:18,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm just missing something.

719
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:26,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess for the fighting fan diehard, all the little tweaks they've done with the game and so on to balance and so on make it worth it for them, which is fine.

720
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:33,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, I am not a hardcore fighting game fan, nor have I ever confessed to be, but I do enjoy the occasional fighter.

721
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:36,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually do enjoy the Mortal Kombat games.

722
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:37,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that makes me weird, but whatever.

723
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:39,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Calibur, especially.

724
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Soul Calibur games.

725
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:40,611
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a lot of fun.

726
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:42,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

727
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:43,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

728
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:44,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm getting off track.

729
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

730
00:59:46,093 --> 00:59:51,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else coming to the PlayStation Network, which has been teased before, I think, by us.

731
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:58,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Soldner X, which was a PC game, originally available, I think, mainly on PlayAsia.com.

732
00:59:58,058 --> 01:00:00,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember tons of advertisements for it.

733
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:05,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty awesome looking HD classic shooter game.

734
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,442
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have it available.

735
01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:09,203
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be coming, apparently...

736
01:00:10,283 --> 01:00:23,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week for $10, and it should be, of course, full HD, 1080p, two-player co-op support, leaderboards, and trophy support, and it looks fantastic.

737
01:00:24,272 --> 01:00:25,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be coming out.

738
01:00:25,192 --> 01:00:28,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I think actually that's this Thursday is when we'll be making it out.

739
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:31,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yep, on the 4th for $10.

740
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:35,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely worth checking it out, especially if you're a fan of Gradius or something like that.

741
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:37,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Really cool-looking game.

742
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to check this game out, but SingStar ABBA.

743
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:42,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to have time.

744
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Dancing Queen to sing to my heart's content.

745
01:00:45,682 --> 01:00:51,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I just haven't really been downloading anything on the PlayStation Network because they don't have those prepaid cards.

746
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:52,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like buying my points.

747
01:00:53,004 --> 01:00:57,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I like trading in crap that I don't want for points.

748
01:00:57,785 --> 01:00:58,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they did now.

749
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they did have the cards now.

750
01:01:00,425 --> 01:01:03,006
[SPEAKER_05]: In certain stores, I don't think GameStop has them yet.

751
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:04,509
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop GameStop GameStop

752
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:16,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about some releases around the world that are going to be coming out in this next week.

753
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:21,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll start off with Japan and what's coming out there on December the 4th on the Xbox 360.

754
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:25,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Fallout 3 gets its Japanese version this week, so check that out.

755
01:01:26,023 --> 01:01:29,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row 2 also gets a Japanese release on December 4th.

756
01:01:29,706 --> 01:01:33,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you live in Japan and want to check out one of Loki's favorite games, Saints Row 2 is where it's at.

757
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:34,891
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PS3

758

[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to look at some other consoles like the Nintendo Wii, you can get Wii Speak comes out on December 4th.

760
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:09,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the standalone thing there.

761
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:15,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking Mama 2, Taihan Mama wa Oshiyogashi comes out from Taito.

[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking Mama 2 in Japan.

763

[SPEAKER_04]: on the Nintendo Wii.

764
01:02:18,344 --> 01:02:21,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to check this game out, 428 is the name of the game.

765
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:26,049
[SPEAKER_04]: 428, Fusa Sarita Shibuya Day comes out.

766
01:02:26,149 --> 01:02:28,271
[SPEAKER_04]: An interactive graphic novel.

767
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that looks kind of neat, actually.

768
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:31,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like real actors.

769
01:02:31,593 --> 01:02:33,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It got a perfect score from Famitsu.

770
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:33,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

771
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:35,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perfect.

772
01:02:35,315 --> 01:02:35,856
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 out of 40.

773
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet you don't hear much about it.

774
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:41,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's a game that looks like it could work for a hardcore game.

775
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's got live cutscenes mixed in it and stuff.

776
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So this isn't a game that they can really release here at all.

777
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:50,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Not without some major overhaul.

778
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:52,058
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to reshoot everything.

779
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:58,024
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad because there's a game that might be something that us American, we hardcore gamers are looking for.

780
01:02:59,454 --> 01:03:01,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I'll have to understand Japanese, I guess.

781
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:06,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, PlayStation 2, Dragon Ball Z, Infinite World comes out on December 4th on PlayStation 2.

785
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Pachinko Game.

[SPEAKER_04]: Busy, busy.

795
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:11,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as the PSP goes, I don't think there's a whole lot.

796
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:15,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, they got a big, big game coming out this week in Japan on PSP.

810
01:05:30,214 --> 01:05:30,994

[SPEAKER_05]: They are really bad.

837
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:53,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for little girls.

838
01:07:53,753 --> 01:07:55,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really bad.

839
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Bigfoot Collision Course on the Wii.

840
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:03,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is it for the first week of December.

841
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:06,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And sadly, that is the most populated week of the month.

842
01:08:07,162 --> 01:08:07,863
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

843
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:26,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

844
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:50,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, hey, if you're not looking to get new games, you can still continue to supplement the ones you have from download content.

845
01:08:50,232 --> 01:08:54,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And in January, Fallout 3 is going to be getting some new download content.

846
01:08:55,216 --> 01:09:00,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Fallout 3 is one of those games I probably won't have the time to check out until January, so this will be just in time for that.

847
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,511
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

848
01:09:23,849 --> 01:09:34,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Operation Anchorage, which is where you go into a military simulation and you actually get to save Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese communist invaders.

849
01:09:35,294 --> 01:09:36,214
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Sarah Palin.

850
01:09:36,974 --> 01:09:38,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's in the Fallout story.

851
01:09:38,995 --> 01:09:39,455
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pit.

852
01:09:39,996 --> 01:09:43,577
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to go to a raider town called The Pit, which is outside of Pittsburgh.

853
01:09:43,777 --> 01:09:44,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

854
01:09:44,157 --> 01:09:44,538
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pit?

855
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:45,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha!

856
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:49,199
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out in February, and then Broken Steel is coming out in March.

857
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,281
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you get to join the Brotherhood of Steel.

858
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,145
[SPEAKER_04]: and forget it.

859
01:09:55,406 --> 01:09:56,210
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I follow a 90210 joke?

860
01:09:58,551 --> 01:10:01,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Fable 2 is getting some download content as well.

861
01:10:01,593 --> 01:10:06,276
[SPEAKER_05]: They just announced the brand new island that they're adding called Knothole Island.

862
01:10:07,197 --> 01:10:09,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to feature a bunch of cool stuff.

863
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:14,662
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have three unique quests and three unique dungeons.

864
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:19,745
[SPEAKER_05]: You can unravel the mystical secrets of the Resurrection Shrine.

865
01:10:20,826 --> 01:10:22,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus they're going to have some new outfits.

866
01:10:23,548 --> 01:10:27,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Like an armored knight outfit, an assassin, a barbarian, leather clad biker.

867
01:10:28,912 --> 01:10:29,652
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

868
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:44,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And six new weapons, a dozen of unique potions that I guess will drastically alter your appearance, new weapon customization, I guess they're going to have new augments, and 50 additional leaderboards.

869
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:51,490
[SPEAKER_05]: and along with that they're going to have actually some free download content as well in case you don't want to buy it.

870
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course that Knothole pack is going to be 800 Microsoft points.

871
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:05,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just say though that Knothole is a terrible name because it makes me think of a very naughty place because Knothole sounds too much like Balloon Knot.

872
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:06,853
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

873
01:11:06,913 --> 01:11:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really bad, bad name for an expansion pack.

874
01:11:12,074 --> 01:11:14,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Knothole Island with the biker outfit.

875
01:11:15,942 --> 01:11:17,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, yo.

876
01:11:18,244 --> 01:11:19,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought Animal Crossing was gay.

877
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:20,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

878
01:11:21,006 --> 01:11:29,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and apparently, I guess the free download pack they're going to have is some stuff, I guess, teasing from the main download thing.

879
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:35,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have Knight's Boots, Assassin's Gloves, a special weight loss potion, and a collectible silver book.

880
01:11:37,357 --> 01:11:42,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll also want to download that in case you don't want to buy this content so you can play co-op with people that do.

881
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might be good too.

882
01:11:46,826 --> 01:11:51,869
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a rumor now that Fable 2 will be hitting PCs sometime soon.

883
01:11:51,909 --> 01:12:03,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, an inside source claims that they've heard some information, I guess from someone at Lionhead, that Fable 2 would be coming to PCs on February 15th.

884
01:12:06,417 --> 01:12:07,158
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

885
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

886
01:12:43,496 --> 01:12:43,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Teehee!

887
01:12:44,077 --> 01:12:45,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Heeheehee!

888
01:12:45,398 --> 01:12:49,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game called Gabo, and it's actually a reworked version of Seaman 2, apparently.

889
01:12:50,462 --> 01:12:57,807
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all coming from Yut Saito's blog, and he's the guy who invented Seaman, if you can believe it.

890
01:12:58,428 --> 01:13:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, I guess it's still like a year away?

891
01:13:04,353 --> 01:13:05,654
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a ways off for this game.

892
01:13:06,494 --> 01:13:10,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have actually a little demo on the blog that you can look at, which is kind of interesting.

893
01:13:12,307 --> 01:13:19,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you're a big fan of this series, which, you know, the series did have its fans, despite our whole little five-year-old joking.

894
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just interesting to see the iPhone kind of get more and more and more games.

895
01:13:22,475 --> 01:13:26,638
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was some rumor out there that the iPhone has crossed like 10,000 different apps.

896
01:13:26,658 --> 01:13:30,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a little high, but there's definitely a lot of stuff available on the iPhone now.

897
01:13:31,502 --> 01:13:33,484
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always room for C-Men on an iPhone.

898
01:13:33,544 --> 01:13:34,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

899
01:13:36,826 --> 01:13:38,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, there was a rumor...

900
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,539
[SPEAKER_05]: That I may have talked about a few weeks ago.

901
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:43,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

902
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:44,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do I?

903
01:13:45,762 --> 01:13:48,584
[SPEAKER_05]: About the new 360s that will be coming out.

904
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually shipping now, apparently.

905
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:53,789
[SPEAKER_05]: With onboard memory.

906
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:54,650
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

907
01:13:54,690 --> 01:14:00,094
[SPEAKER_05]: The new arcade systems are supposedly shipping with the new Jasper chipset.

908
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:05,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Which promises a cooler 65 nanometer GPU on the motherboard.

909
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have...

910
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:16,950
[SPEAKER_05]: expanded the onboard flash to 256 megabytes, which would be enough for storing the new Xbox experience.

911
01:14:19,733 --> 01:14:23,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess going forward, it's of course going to be preloaded on all the different systems.

912
01:14:23,897 --> 01:14:27,981
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also use that space for game saves or whatever else you want to use it for.

913
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:29,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like an extra...

914
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,161
[SPEAKER_05]: 200 megs of space, which is kind of cool.

915
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:44,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently, I think the arcade system still will be coming with an external 256 megabyte memory card, so they're kind of doubling the onboard space with that, which is kind of neat.

916
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:46,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And new is always good.

917
01:14:48,825 --> 01:14:50,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've known this for a while now, haven't you?

918
01:14:51,105 --> 01:14:51,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

919
01:14:52,005 --> 01:14:52,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

920
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:55,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You tell me.

921
01:14:56,907 --> 01:14:57,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow...

922
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Layton, the first movie is going to be coming out in January of 2010.

923
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,159
[SPEAKER_04]: in Japan.

924
01:15:24,299 --> 01:15:25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

925
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't know this series, Studio Ghibli definitely kind of influenced these games.

926
01:15:30,244 --> 01:15:32,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably not much of a surprise.

927
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:33,707
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't make the game.

928
01:15:33,727 --> 01:15:34,888
[SPEAKER_04]: They just influenced the games.

929
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:40,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big surprise that this is going to be made into a movie eventually.

930
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:46,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll have to get a sub or something if you want to watch it here in the US or just pray that it'll come out here eventually.

931
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:47,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

932
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:52,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because they've had at least three or four different releases in that series in Japan.

933
01:15:53,422 --> 01:15:55,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just we haven't seen them all over here yet.

934
01:15:55,483 --> 01:15:58,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes sense, and they're insanely popular over there.

935
01:15:58,645 --> 01:16:01,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck, I mean, they made an Animal Crossing movie over there too, remember?

936
01:16:01,646 --> 01:16:05,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to answer GameGuru's thing in chat, is Studio Ghibli making it?

937
01:16:05,688 --> 01:16:06,629
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they are not.

938
01:16:06,669 --> 01:16:09,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just saying that the games are Studio Ghibli-esque.

939
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:10,151
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

940
01:16:10,851 --> 01:16:11,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a comparison.

941
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:12,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't want to alarm anybody.

942
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:13,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

943
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:15,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be alarmed.

944
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:48,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's my turn tonight to pick a classic game of the week that I think you all ought to be playing.

945
01:16:50,186 --> 01:16:57,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to really dig deep tonight because I've been promising for quite some time that if I ever get to do another classic video game of the week, I would pick something from the Commodore 64.

946
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:03,594
[SPEAKER_04]: This is exactly what I've picked tonight as a game from my childhood that I remember from a long time ago.

947
01:17:03,654 --> 01:17:07,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game called Lazy Jones is tonight's classic game of the week.

948
01:17:08,775 --> 01:17:18,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the interesting thing about Lazy Jones is that it was a game that was kind of made up of all these other smaller games that kind of came together in this big entity.

949
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like WarioWare back before there was WarioWare, if this makes any sense at all.

950
01:17:23,482 --> 01:17:36,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we're looking at a video of this game in progress here in the studio, and you can see this minigame, you are stabbing turkeys coming off a conveyor belt with a giant fork, and you have to avoid stabbing the telephone that's randomly bouncing around the screen.

951
01:17:37,942 --> 01:17:39,184
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

952
01:17:54,401 --> 01:17:55,202
[SPEAKER_04]: The Spectrum Version

953
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: The video games are somewhat inspired by other games.

954
01:18:12,179 --> 01:18:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There are definitely games that are like Frogger, like Space Invader in here.

955
01:18:17,602 --> 01:18:19,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's also some games that have funny names.

956
01:18:19,323 --> 01:18:23,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a game in here called 99 Red Balloons.

957
01:18:24,045 --> 01:18:27,806
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a game where you just have red balloons that continually go up towards the top of the screen.

958
01:18:27,826 --> 01:18:33,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You try to get a hold of a couple of the balloons, and if you're able to do that, then you can get up to the top and give a woman a big kiss.

959
01:18:33,809 --> 01:19:01,117
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you get a balloon to go back down where you go up and down by grabbing these different balloons and none of these games go on a particularly long time you just play the game for about a minute until the clock runs out and your score basically transfers to the larger score that you have so this game is really wacky and just kind of takes us back to a time when you know really really was only one person that made games but the other thing that kind of made Lazy Jones special at least to me was the fact that it had a really unique soundtrack and I know you can kind of hear it in the background

960
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,137
[SPEAKER_04]: is definitely kind of its own little thing.

961
01:19:07,517 --> 01:19:12,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I want to play for you one clip in particular from the game Lazy Jones by David Whitaker.

962
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:14,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if it sounds familiar to you at all.

963
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a clip from the game.

964
01:19:15,401 --> 01:19:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

965
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:30,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a clip from the Lazy Jones game that came out years ago.

966
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:31,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that sound familiar to anybody at all?

967
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:32,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

968
01:19:32,411 --> 01:19:36,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it actually was sampled years later in 1999 by a band.

969
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:42,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually sampled by the group Zombie Nation.

970
01:19:42,997 --> 01:19:43,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Current craft 400.

971
01:19:52,424 --> 01:19:53,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it's the same song.

972
01:19:53,685 --> 01:20:01,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of funny, because the game was, you know, originally made with the C64 sound chip in it, and it's that kind of unique noise that is still used today.

973
01:20:02,127 --> 01:20:03,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

974
01:20:03,948 --> 01:20:05,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So, back to the clip here a little bit.

975
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:12,850
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think one reason I just really remember this game was, you know, like I said, it was really awesome to have one video game that had, like, all these mini-games in it.

976
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just kept trying to really increase your score in the mini-games, because some of them were really hard.

977
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some of them would end, like...

978
01:20:20,132 --> 01:20:21,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

979
01:20:41,846 --> 01:20:42,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

980
01:21:01,195 --> 01:21:05,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, here's the random... There's two random doors, because there's only 15 minigames, so like 18 doors.

981
01:21:06,381 --> 01:21:11,807
[SPEAKER_04]: There's random things you'll walk into as well, like there's a broom closet that you'll randomly walk into, and then a potty.

982
01:21:12,488 --> 01:21:13,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And you watch your guy go to the bathroom.

983
01:21:14,009 --> 01:21:18,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Not explicitly or gross, but he just walks in there and then walks out.

984
01:21:18,775 --> 01:21:19,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so random.

985
01:21:20,257 --> 01:21:21,298
[SPEAKER_04]: But, there it is!

986
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:33,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy Jones for the Commodore 64 my classic game of the week and stowing away on a DarkSakura's classic game of the week segment she'll be back next week with her own pick

987
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:36,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

988
01:21:37,468 --> 01:21:43,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we come back, we'll have plenty more in Part B. We're going to talk about the Nintendo Wii a little bit and some of the top secret things going on with the Wii.

989
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:47,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk a little Chrono Trigger and talk some PC games, which we don't talk about enough.

990
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll also open up the mailbag.

991
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:52,593
[SPEAKER_04]: All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

992
01:21:58,837 --> 01:22:03,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 30th of 2008.

993
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: One more month left in the year, if you can believe it.

994
01:22:07,075 --> 01:22:08,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow will be on the 1st of December.

995
01:22:09,736 --> 01:22:11,136
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has the night off.

996
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: However though,

997
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:13,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe, because Nintendo would not be so kind as to release an Excite Truck 2 so soon, it's probably going to be F-Zero.

998
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Would be my guess.

999
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:21,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is not necessarily bad, because Excite Truck was awesome.

1000
01:23:21,733 --> 01:23:23,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even think about that.

1001
01:23:23,393 --> 01:23:26,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So you keep that kind of awesome control...

1002
01:23:28,581 --> 01:23:29,061
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1003
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:34,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind if they release an Excite Truck 2 because I would be there lined up at midnight ready to buy that game.

1004
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was awesome.

1005
01:23:36,564 --> 01:23:39,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Excite Truck, absolutely most favorite game of the Wii ever.

1006
01:23:40,006 --> 01:23:42,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think F-Zero's gotta come out sooner rather than later.

1007
01:23:43,007 --> 01:23:46,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the AXGX thing, I guess, must have disappointed some folks.

1008
01:23:47,049 --> 01:23:49,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I love F-Zero GX.

1009
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,230
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an amazing game.

1010
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:55,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope... Yeah, as GameGuru says in chat, F-Zero WX would be awesome.

1011
01:23:56,013 --> 01:23:56,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1012
01:23:56,973 --> 01:24:01,277
[SPEAKER_04]: or as Actdeft says in chat, chat.orangeentree.com Excite Truck 2.

1013
01:24:01,697 --> 01:24:02,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Excite yourself.

1014
01:24:03,599 --> 01:24:05,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Excite Truck 2 would be awesome.

1015
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,985
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need to... This is one of those games that I would hope that they don't go back and try to tweak too much of it.

1016
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:12,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Just add a lot more tracks.

1017
01:24:12,827 --> 01:24:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Add the ability to download new tracks later on.

1018
01:24:15,629 --> 01:24:24,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe four-player split-screen multiplayer or four-player multiplayer over the Wi-Fi service.

1019
01:24:25,919 --> 01:24:26,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stuff like that.

1020
01:24:26,599 --> 01:24:27,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Just really simple stuff.

1021
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,120
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't really need to go too crazy with it.

1022
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe improve the graphics a little bit.

1023
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:34,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, on F-Zero, you could have up to 30 people in a race on the GX.

1024
01:24:34,463 --> 01:24:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they could do that online.

1025
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:36,924
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty awesome.

1026
01:24:36,944 --> 01:24:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty cool.

1027
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:38,724
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you can't cheat.

1028
01:24:39,725 --> 01:24:41,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, Mario Kart, everybody cheats.

1029
01:24:41,586 --> 01:24:44,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would have a feeling they probably would be able to cheat somehow.

1030
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:47,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, GS68 says it perfectly in chat.

1031
01:24:47,268 --> 01:24:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero Wii needs to not have exploits, damn it.

1032
01:24:49,769 --> 01:24:51,350
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero X has wall raping.

1033
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:54,131
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero GX has space flying and snaking and so on.

1034
01:24:55,754 --> 01:25:02,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, hopefully, yeah, hopefully it's, whatever it is, it's probably going to be awesome.

1035
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:06,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like I said, Excite Truck was awesome, F-Zero would be really cool.

1036
01:25:07,557 --> 01:25:09,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping for another Excite Truck or F-Zero game.

1037
01:25:09,718 --> 01:25:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's something new, great, you know, news always, you know, optimistically good, I guess.

1038
01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:21,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this will be something they announce at E3.

1039
01:25:22,012 --> 01:25:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's why it's such a big secret.

1040
01:25:23,155 --> 01:25:24,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have been working on it for two years now.

1041
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:28,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, because what have you seen since Excite Truck?

1042
01:25:29,159 --> 01:25:30,560
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you haven't seen Excite Truck 2.

1043
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think it would take them two years to make Excite Truck 2?

1044
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:34,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping it is F-Zero.

1045
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:34,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1046
01:25:35,322 --> 01:25:38,303
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to make it super awesome, maybe.

1047
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:42,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it might be randomly a non-racing game?

1048
01:25:42,244 --> 01:25:42,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think no?

1049
01:25:42,944 --> 01:25:43,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1050
01:25:43,525 --> 01:25:45,425
[SPEAKER_05]: This company only makes racing games.

1051
01:25:45,886 --> 01:25:47,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's good, because you know what?

1052
01:25:47,406 --> 01:25:48,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They know how to make a good racing game.

1053
01:25:51,222 --> 01:25:52,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm optimistic.

1054
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:23,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Capcom has actually kind of put out a statement about why these games are not coming out on the Wii.

1055
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2 couldn't ever be WiiWare even at 480p.

1056
01:26:47,314 --> 01:26:51,396
[SPEAKER_04]: The file size is just too large given the storage restrictions for WiiWare.

1057
01:26:51,776 --> 01:26:55,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Theoretically, it could be discs-based, but there are no plans at the moment.

1058
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:56,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1059
01:26:56,959 --> 01:27:03,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I mean, how good-looking would it really be if you took, like, an HD title and downscaled it to 480p?

1060
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:04,242
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not even worth...

1061
01:27:05,931 --> 01:27:06,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1062
01:27:17,192 --> 01:27:19,113
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I even forgot what it's called, Virtual Console.

1063
01:27:19,393 --> 01:27:27,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and also in Japan, you remember next week we get Street Fighter versus, was it Tatsunoko or whatever?

1064
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:27,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1065
01:27:27,857 --> 01:27:30,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Capcom versus, yeah.

1066
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:32,759
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's what you need to be playing on there.

1067
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,240
[SPEAKER_05]: They port that over and do something with it, that'd be pretty awesome.

1068
01:27:37,315 --> 01:27:38,096
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, there you go.

1069
01:27:38,516 --> 01:27:40,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to stuff going on on the DS.

1070
01:27:40,398 --> 01:27:42,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Chrono Trigger is coming out on the DS here.

1071
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It just came out this week.

1072
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anybody personally that picked it up.

1073
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:46,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious.

1074
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:47,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it.

1075
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I did enjoy Chrono Trigger, but I still have to finish Final Fantasy IV on the DS.

1076
01:27:51,507 --> 01:27:52,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a lot of DS playing to do.

1077
01:27:53,228 --> 01:27:57,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in Europe, of course, they got screwed and they don't have the game yet.

1078
01:27:57,789 --> 01:28:00,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, though, it is coming out in February.

1079
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:06,392
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what some sources have told Eurogamer, is that the game is supposed to be making its way out there in February.

1080
01:28:06,852 --> 01:28:16,835
[SPEAKER_04]: This, of course, the new Chrono Trigger DS version with the new dungeon, the new ending, two-screen display, touchscreen controls, Wi-Fi multiplayer, and so on and so on.

1081
01:28:17,816 --> 01:28:19,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get why it takes so long.

1082
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:20,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

1083
01:28:20,877 --> 01:28:23,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already localized, so what's the delay for?

1084
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:39,742
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I can think of is this time of year, as far as duplication goes, a lot of the plants that duplicate games are at full capacity right now, and if they're thinking that they're not going to be able to duplicate this game enough to have adequate supplies...

1085
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1086
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,021
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to get this comment from chat because I think it's good.

1087
01:29:03,342 --> 01:29:16,509
[SPEAKER_04]: VXJasonXV says, The only people clamoring for Street Fighter HD Remix on the Wii are the 13, 14, 15 year olds who don't have the money for their own systems and only have the family Wii and won't be getting the 360 or PS3 as a gift or anything.

1088
01:29:17,209 --> 01:29:17,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

1089
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:20,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a job!

1090
01:29:20,411 --> 01:29:21,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1091
01:29:22,672 --> 01:29:23,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Go out and get a job.

1092
01:29:23,793 --> 01:29:24,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait.

1093
01:29:24,653 --> 01:29:25,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, I mean...

1094
01:29:27,385 --> 01:29:52,448
[SPEAKER_05]: if there's anything you can learn from this whole Street Fighter Turbo HD remix thing is it pays to wait because if you bought the original Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo or whatever on Xbox Live Arcade now there's a new one that's coming out that's better it's like crap, I just wasted money on that remember if you wait for things to get ironed out there will be a version that will be coming to the Wii I'm sure

1095
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:57,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have to be patient.

1096
01:29:58,008 --> 01:29:58,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Or get a job.

1097
01:29:59,388 --> 01:30:04,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that might be coming to the Wii, and once again, this kind of goes back to the Chrono Trigger thing.

1098
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:06,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why they couldn't just bring it over.

1099
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:08,672
[SPEAKER_05]: The localization's done already.

1100
01:30:09,853 --> 01:30:13,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Disaster Day of Crisis may be coming to North America.

1101
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:21,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, one person was emailing Nintendo customer support, I guess, regarding

1102
01:30:22,276 --> 01:30:22,556
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

1103
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why they wouldn't because it's a Nintendo game.

1104
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes no effort on their part to bring it over here.

1105
01:30:47,884 --> 01:30:48,904
[SPEAKER_04]: All the work's done already.

1106
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,726
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, though, what if the dude was wrong?

1107
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:56,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people are putting a lot of stock in what this rep says.

1108
01:30:56,928 --> 01:30:58,189
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they made a mistake?

1109
01:30:58,869 --> 01:31:21,617
[SPEAKER_05]: well if they made a mistake then yeah i could see but my point is it's done it's already been released in europe so it's translated already they've got it done it's just it bring it over if it's in english already you can bring it over here i'll see what the big while you're at it how about mother three right am i right translation hasn't been done over there

1110
01:31:23,486 --> 01:31:25,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than Wii Music

1111
01:31:51,843 --> 01:31:53,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Mother 3 come out in the UK?

1112
01:31:53,785 --> 01:31:53,885
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1113
01:31:54,446 --> 01:31:55,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it did.

1114
01:31:55,527 --> 01:31:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: No, if it did, everyone wouldn't be bitching because they would be importing it.

1115
01:31:58,930 --> 01:31:59,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm just crazy.

1116
01:31:59,871 --> 01:32:06,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there wouldn't be an issue with why would they even have to do a fan translation then because it's already done for them.

1117
01:32:07,238 --> 01:32:08,359
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be no more bitching.

1118
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:18,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, apparently, We and WeFit have been a big cause of part of the Black Friday chaos.

1119
01:32:18,928 --> 01:32:30,556
[SPEAKER_04]: The most popular products out there on Black Friday this year, and of course, if you've never heard of this, you probably don't live in the U.S., Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving where people go fucking nuts over sales just in time for Christmas.

1120
01:32:30,616 --> 01:32:33,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically Canada's Boxing Day without any...

1121
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:42,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all a consumer holiday, specifically, whereas I think there's actually some reason for it in Canada.

1122
01:32:42,525 --> 01:32:45,287
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, no, it was all made up by the stores.

1123
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:52,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one most popular product on Black Friday was the Nintendo Wii console.

1124
01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:54,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a big surprise.

1125
01:32:54,755 --> 01:32:59,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five Wii Fit was the number five biggest product on Black Friday.

1126
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:01,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Not surprised, eh?

1127
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:02,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised.

1128
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:06,830
[SPEAKER_05]: People will play it for a while and they'll be all excited about it and then they'll put it away.

1129
01:33:09,074 --> 01:33:13,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But I bet it's a bunch of parents also buying it for their fat kids, right?

1130
01:33:14,043 --> 01:33:14,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

1131
01:33:15,922 --> 01:33:17,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat Kids won't play that exercise game.

1132
01:33:19,184 --> 01:33:21,986
[SPEAKER_04]: VXJSNXV says, I thought Boxing Day was December 26th.

1133
01:33:22,066 --> 01:33:22,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1134
01:33:22,747 --> 01:33:24,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of the day of Thanksgiving, they have the day after Christmas.

1135
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But same idea.

1136
01:33:26,749 --> 01:33:27,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's chaos at the stores.

1137
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:31,873
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't hear about Canadian Massacre at Walmart on Boxing Day either.

1138
01:33:33,814 --> 01:33:35,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadians are smart not to shop at Walmart.

1139
01:33:35,816 --> 01:33:36,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1140
01:33:36,976 --> 01:33:38,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not just that.

1141
01:33:38,618 --> 01:33:43,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming a little more civil because they didn't trample each other.

1142
01:33:44,922 --> 01:33:45,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1143
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:45,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1144
01:33:47,304 --> 01:33:53,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's some news that Rare may do a new Killer Instincts game.

1145
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:59,312
[SPEAKER_04]: You know... How fucking often does this rumor come up?

1146
01:33:59,613 --> 01:34:00,153
[SPEAKER_04]: What now?

1147
01:34:00,253 --> 01:34:03,816
[SPEAKER_04]: What now has provoked the new Killer Instinct of the Week rumor?

1148
01:34:05,397 --> 01:34:08,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, basically this is coming from...

1149
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:24,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, their studio manager, Matt Betteridge, and he says, Killer Instinct is an IP that is fondly remembered and we may do something with it, but it's a tricky market to be like the old Killer Instinct.

1150
01:34:25,324 --> 01:34:26,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, we would have to...

1151
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1152
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:55,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember it being that awesome, so I don't really care if it comes out.

1153
01:34:55,414 --> 01:34:58,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I don't really care about most things that Rare puts out.

1154
01:34:59,217 --> 01:35:01,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So... No, I gotta say, it is pretty awesome.

1155
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I love me some Killer Instinct.

1156
01:35:03,721 --> 01:35:04,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

1157
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:07,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it pisses me off.

1158
01:35:08,805 --> 01:35:10,967
[SPEAKER_05]: God, it just doesn't... I don't care.

1159
01:35:11,047 --> 01:35:12,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Orchid vs. Spinal.

1160
01:35:13,629 --> 01:35:14,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, this game was awesome.

1161
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:18,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they would have to put a lot of work into it, and...

1162
01:35:19,628 --> 01:35:22,752
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they throw in Cameo as an unlockable character because that would be weird.

1163
01:35:23,452 --> 01:35:25,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could brutally murder her and that would be funny.

1164
01:35:27,057 --> 01:35:27,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1165
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:32,763
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR in chat says, I'm from Rare.

1166
01:35:33,104 --> 01:35:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Our official announcement is that there will be an official announcement made at an undisclosed time in our own heads.

1167
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:38,610
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1168
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:53,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I am so angsty every time I hear this rumor about a freaking new Killer Instinct game because it seems like every other week there's some cryptic goddamn quote coming out of somebody's mouth from Rare that cock-teases a new Killer Instinct game.

1169
01:35:53,569 --> 01:35:57,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm getting the more angsty, the more and more time that goes by and they won't announce something already.

1170
01:35:57,353 --> 01:35:58,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know what this means.

1171
01:36:14,551 --> 01:36:16,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you can start us off tonight, because DarkSakura's not here.

1172
01:36:18,113 --> 01:36:19,453
[SPEAKER_05]: FQ to PopCap Games.

1173
01:36:20,494 --> 01:36:29,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I was busy transferring all my saves and all my information from my old 20GB hard drive to my new 120GB hard drive for my Xbox 360.

1174
01:36:29,778 --> 01:36:38,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I bought the hard drive used, I do not have a transfer cable that can facilitate just transferring everything in all one foul swoop, so I had to actually use memory cards.

1175
01:36:38,682 --> 01:36:42,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you guess what two saves would not fucking transfer on there?

1176
01:36:43,504 --> 01:37:09,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Zuma and Bejeweled 2 both PopCap games and why the fuck will they not transfer over all the other games for all the other systems including some of the PopCap games transfer just fine but for some reason Bejeweled 2 and Zuma have to be a little bit which happen to be the two the wife has to have exactly and so and they will not transfer I put something on their Twitter you know saying hey what the fuck you know why is this not working they're like

1177
01:37:10,234 --> 01:37:11,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're looking into it.

1178
01:37:11,515 --> 01:37:14,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, complain, complain, complain.

1179
01:37:14,237 --> 01:37:15,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1180
01:37:15,378 --> 01:37:21,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know, despite this whole thing, me yelling at Rare, I know there are actually people from PopGapGames that do listen to this fair program here.

1181
01:37:21,783 --> 01:37:22,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Patch the bitch.

1182
01:37:22,463 --> 01:37:23,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we need to do.

1183
01:37:23,284 --> 01:37:24,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Patch this so that it will move.

1184
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe this is the first time they're finding out about it.

1185
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an odd error.

1186
01:37:28,328 --> 01:37:32,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's not something that I think you could have foresight into either.

1187
01:37:32,231 --> 01:37:35,033
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just an error out of the blue.

1188
01:37:35,513 --> 01:37:38,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sounds like Microsoft's involved somehow, too.

1189
01:37:38,495 --> 01:37:39,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It is strange that it is...

1190
01:37:39,716 --> 01:37:41,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Just those two games.

1191
01:37:41,177 --> 01:37:48,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally the limitation is that you can only transfer files to a memory card with the same profile.

1192
01:37:48,481 --> 01:37:57,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, I had to have a profile signed in on one console with the old hard drive and logged in as me and then had another console logged in as me as well.

1193
01:37:57,807 --> 01:38:00,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I just copied the profile.

1194
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:07,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had to transfer from one profile to the memory card back to my profile on the other system.

1195
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:08,475
[SPEAKER_05]: and it will allow you to do that.

1196
01:38:08,495 --> 01:38:12,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't allow you to transfer from a different profile or something like that because you can't do that.

1197
01:38:14,181 --> 01:38:17,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But those were the only two games that would not let me transfer them at all.

1198
01:38:17,462 --> 01:38:19,622
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else would not let me transfer it?

1199
01:38:19,782 --> 01:38:24,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Hexic HD would not let me transfer that game to the other hard drive.

1200
01:38:24,564 --> 01:38:26,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And see, that's one of Microsoft's own games.

1201
01:38:26,324 --> 01:38:29,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So you think there's something on a deeper level going on here.

1202
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:31,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have misdirected anger.

1203
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:34,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that they won't even let me re-download.

1204
01:38:34,166 --> 01:38:34,886
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid.

1205
01:38:34,986 --> 01:38:38,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So not that I really play that game, but it's still, come on, man.

1206
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:44,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So like if I deleted that game somehow by accident, then I would never be able to get it back.

1207
01:38:46,774 --> 01:38:49,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot.

1208
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:54,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say FU to alcohol for being so nummy.

1209
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:58,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had my first little sip of alcohol in like seven months the other day.

1210
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:02,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I would have a glass of wine on Thanksgiving and I had a Pinot Noir.

1211
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:04,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1212
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:38,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's kind of interesting that we're coming off of the FUs of the week to this, but there's a brand new website called Bad Hacks.

1213
01:39:38,808 --> 01:39:52,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's badhacks.net, and it features a collection of ROM hacks that are, well, basically sexist, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, pro, and occasionally slightly amusing.

1214
01:39:54,062 --> 01:39:57,965
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently you can download all sorts of really bad hacks on there.

1215
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:05,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the interesting stuff on the list here and I'm just going to kind of go down the list real quick.

1216
01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:06,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1217
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:34,211
[SPEAKER_05]: BabyMaker, BastardMaster, DeadBubbleBubble, DickAndMilk, DickKids, DickTales, FuckersQuest, GauntletXXX, GayGhostFuckers2, Homocop, InnerCityRansom, KillerMan, LittleRemo, TheChildAbuser, MarioNude, MegaCrap, MegaFag, MetalQueer,

1218
01:40:35,414 --> 01:40:48,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Naked Little Mermaid, Naked Samus, Nazi Dr. Mario, Nude Punch-Out, Orgy Time, Pot Man 3, and then some of these really elaborate ones.

1219
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:49,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Scrappy!

1220
01:40:51,123 --> 01:40:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nazi Penis Cartel Freedom Fighters Leet, and, uh, South Park Zelda.

1221
01:40:58,548 --> 01:40:59,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's not bad.

1222
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what else here?

1223
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:02,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,

1224
01:41:04,645 --> 01:41:10,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario World Chaos Complex, Sex Pot Racing, fun fun stuff.

1225
01:41:11,986 --> 01:41:15,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So, is it just me or is it a really fucking slow news week or something?

1226
01:41:15,508 --> 01:41:16,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what the fuck?

1227
01:41:16,609 --> 01:41:17,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is this news?

1228
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1229
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:19,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really fucking slow news week.

1230
01:41:19,931 --> 01:41:22,033
[SPEAKER_04]: People have too much fucking time on their hands.

1231
01:41:22,073 --> 01:41:23,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also play Super Goatsy Brothers.

1232
01:41:24,915 --> 01:41:27,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yippee, hooray, hi, yay, yip.

1233
01:41:28,317 --> 01:41:29,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited.

1234
01:41:29,138 --> 01:41:33,360
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there's lots of interesting stuff on there.

1235
01:41:33,781 --> 01:41:35,742
[SPEAKER_04]: As if you couldn't find enough of these on your normal websites.

1236
01:41:35,762 --> 01:41:37,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, there's a whole website.

1237
01:41:38,023 --> 01:41:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an entire website about it.

1238
01:41:39,524 --> 01:41:40,645
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this God Hates You?

1239
01:41:40,725 --> 01:41:41,486
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that a hack of?

1240
01:41:43,987 --> 01:41:48,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like a... Is it a Bible game that they hacked or something?

1241
01:41:49,609 --> 01:41:52,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Spiritual Warfare is... Okay, interesting.

1242
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Babymaker, what's that a hack of?

1243
01:41:55,872 --> 01:41:56,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Dig Dug!

1244
01:41:56,713 --> 01:41:57,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1245
01:41:57,613 --> 01:41:58,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gonna be classy.

1246
01:42:03,556 --> 01:42:03,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun times.

1247
01:42:05,116 --> 01:42:05,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1248
01:42:05,497 --> 01:42:08,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1249
01:42:08,278 --> 01:42:08,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1250
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:11,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, whatever.

1251
01:42:12,443 --> 01:42:13,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, let's talk about PC.

1252
01:42:13,984 --> 01:42:18,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, if it's going to be a slow news week, then why don't we talk about some things we don't normally talk about here on the show.

1253
01:42:18,246 --> 01:42:19,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's PC gaming news.

1254
01:42:19,907 --> 01:42:21,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you know the game Fear?

1255
01:42:22,088 --> 01:42:23,469
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a pretty popular game that came out.

1256
01:42:23,769 --> 01:42:27,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was console as well as PC, but I think it was pretty well known for the PC.

1257
01:42:28,071 --> 01:42:32,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear 2 Project Origin is the sequel to this game.

1258
01:42:32,874 --> 01:42:34,714
[SPEAKER_04]: It's apparently being banned in Australia.

1259
01:42:34,735 --> 01:42:38,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just recently refused classification by the Australian Classifications Board.

1260
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:39,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they ban now?

1261
01:42:39,937 --> 01:42:53,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to high violence, apparently Warner's trying to assess the situation, and they are right now appealing with the ACB and trying to figure out their options, trying to get Fear 2 released in Australia.

1262
01:42:53,443 --> 01:42:55,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be coming out February 11th in Australia.

1263
01:42:56,204 --> 01:43:03,467
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hoping they can turn that around, but you might have to import an underground copy of this game if you want to play this over in Australia.

1264
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:06,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Just buy the PS3 version.

1265
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:07,049
[SPEAKER_05]: It's region-free.

1266
01:43:09,234 --> 01:43:10,995
[SPEAKER_04]: PC is region free too, right?

1267
01:43:11,015 --> 01:43:11,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1268
01:43:12,255 --> 01:43:12,775
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1269
01:43:14,416 --> 01:43:18,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1270
01:43:18,156 --> 01:43:22,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the part of the show every week where we like to take some time to interact with you guys.

1271
01:43:22,958 --> 01:43:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we take some time to read our favorites here on the air.

1272
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:28,699
... ...

1273
01:43:37,259 --> 01:43:39,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm opening up the mailbag right now.

1274
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:43,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it when we get freaking spam email.

1275
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Did somebody sign us up for spam email?

1276
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:48,441
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like a ha-ha-ha thing.

1277
01:43:49,401 --> 01:43:49,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerks.

1278
01:43:50,521 --> 01:43:53,722
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think Spider signed us up for spam email.

1279
01:43:53,902 --> 01:43:54,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

1280
01:43:54,422 --> 01:43:55,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we disguise our emails on the side?

1281
01:43:56,023 --> 01:43:56,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1282
01:43:56,783 --> 01:43:58,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they still find a way.

1283
01:43:59,243 --> 01:44:02,924
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR sent us an email and wants to know, please tell us what the meaning of life is.

1284
01:44:03,124 --> 01:44:03,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1285
01:44:04,702 --> 01:44:05,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what is the meaning of life?

1286
01:44:07,003 --> 01:44:07,583
[SPEAKER_04]: To live.

1287
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:13,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make the easy 42 joke here.

1288
01:44:13,986 --> 01:44:18,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I could give you like a serious deep answer, but this is a show about dick and fart jokes.

1289
01:44:18,707 --> 01:44:19,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it would fit in here.

1290
01:44:21,155 --> 01:44:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way, the meaning of life is to have impact on others.

1291
01:44:24,117 --> 01:44:25,238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I believe the meaning of life is.

1292
01:44:49,918 --> 01:44:51,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's way too deep for this program.

1293
01:44:54,979 --> 01:44:58,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, we have another email from Katakos.

1294
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:01,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, sometimes it goes by Reese.

1295
01:45:02,601 --> 01:45:07,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Lord Katakos wants to say congratulations on episode 300, even though it's not over 9,000.

1296
01:45:08,422 --> 01:45:12,363
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you guys and girls just keep on going so you can get to 9,001 to be a prodigy.

1297
01:45:12,443 --> 01:45:14,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we're at 50%, but that's halfway there.

1298
01:45:15,285 --> 01:45:15,705
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1299
01:45:15,785 --> 01:45:17,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you need to get 100% healed.

1300
01:45:17,467 --> 01:45:20,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to the server Illidan and I'll use Healing Wave on you and you'll be good to go.

1301
01:45:21,211 --> 01:45:23,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a general note to WoW players out there.

1302
01:45:23,153 --> 01:45:24,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not changing servers.

1303
01:45:24,435 --> 01:45:25,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't mean to be rude.

1304
01:45:25,676 --> 01:45:30,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have a guild of real life friends where I'm at on Ravencrest.

1305
01:45:30,842 --> 01:45:35,127
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as the community calls that server Raven Fail because we have no progression whatsoever on our server.

1306
01:45:35,787 --> 01:45:43,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty sad when our social guild is like one of the top 10 horde rating guilds on the entire server and we kind of sleep our way through.

1307
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:48,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean like literally, but we're very casual in our approach.

1308
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not to say we don't work hard.

1309
01:45:49,849 --> 01:45:53,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very casual in our approach and we've managed to clear quite a bit of stuff as a guild.

1310
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:57,111
[SPEAKER_04]: These are most of the Death Cake people you remember from Final Fantasy XI.

1311
01:45:57,191 --> 01:45:58,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I remember.

1312
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:03,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that we have over 9,000 minutes worth of programming, so there you go.

1313
01:46:03,832 --> 01:46:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1314
01:46:04,992 --> 01:46:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1315
01:46:05,713 --> 01:46:09,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way to look at it.

1316
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:16,302
[SPEAKER_04]: If you count up all the to-go podcasts and all that stuff, when we were doing almost five hours a night for a little while, remember that?

1317
01:46:16,342 --> 01:46:19,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd do a three-and-a-half-hour show, then an hour-long podcast.

1318
01:46:19,284 --> 01:46:19,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1319
01:46:20,265 --> 01:46:21,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the days, right?

1320
01:46:23,648 --> 01:46:26,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, how was an email there from...

1321
01:46:27,455 --> 01:46:29,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the point was, but hey, whatever.

1322
01:46:30,838 --> 01:46:33,800
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an email from Fabrice in Belgium.

1323
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Wants to say hello and I hope there's a show tonight.

1324
01:46:36,802 --> 01:46:38,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was written last week when there was no show.

1325
01:46:39,044 --> 01:46:41,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to apologize to Fabrice from Belgium.

1326
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:42,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1327
01:46:43,167 --> 01:46:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, anyways... He puts that in quotes.

1328
01:46:46,449 --> 01:46:47,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways...

1329
01:46:49,239 --> 01:46:49,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Loki style.

1330
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:56,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning on buying a pinball machine in the future as I understand the best pinball machines are arguably the Addams Family and Terminator 2.

1331
01:46:57,162 --> 01:46:58,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm a big fan of Sega.

1332
01:46:58,762 --> 01:47:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: This will probably be a question for DarkSakura.

1333
01:47:00,503 --> 01:47:02,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the best Sega pinball machine?

1334
01:47:02,543 --> 01:47:08,905
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not here tonight, but if she were, I bet you anything she would say World Cup 98 because I'm almost positive that was the Sega table.

1335
01:47:09,445 --> 01:47:11,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like her favorite machine of all time.

1336
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:13,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm 99% certain that would be her answer.

1337
01:47:15,509 --> 01:47:19,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they're not the best machines by far, but I'm too big of a Sega fan to let this pass by.

1338
01:47:20,052 --> 01:47:21,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Independence Day any good?

1339
01:47:21,593 --> 01:47:23,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably have a chance to buy that one.

1340
01:47:23,734 --> 01:47:25,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not know much about that table.

1341
01:47:25,075 --> 01:47:26,035
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, DarkSakura would be the expert.

1342
01:47:26,056 --> 01:47:26,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I played that one.

1343
01:47:26,936 --> 01:47:27,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

1344
01:47:27,236 --> 01:47:28,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember that being good?

1345
01:47:28,457 --> 01:47:28,697
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1346
01:47:29,197 --> 01:47:30,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Sega do the Jurassic Park one?

1347
01:47:30,918 --> 01:47:31,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that one.

1348
01:47:32,715 --> 01:47:33,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if they did that.

1349
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:38,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say they should have a Sonic spinball table.

1350
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:39,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

1351
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of awesome with a blue pinball.

1352
01:47:41,781 --> 01:47:42,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be cute?

1353
01:47:42,922 --> 01:47:44,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1354
01:47:45,384 --> 01:47:46,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks to Fabrice.

1355
01:47:46,244 --> 01:47:49,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry the real pinball expert isn't here tonight to answer the question.

1356
01:47:49,166 --> 01:47:50,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to ask her for next week.

1357
01:47:50,427 --> 01:47:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, you just struck out.

1358
01:47:52,349 --> 01:47:53,289
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we didn't do a show.

1359
01:47:53,329 --> 01:47:55,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The night you were going to stay up and listen, and I really apologize for that.

1360
01:47:56,271 --> 01:48:01,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the night you have your question read on air, DarkSakura's not even here to answer it.

1361
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Sega do Jurassic Park?

1362
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,121
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a fun promotion.

1363
01:48:04,381 --> 01:48:04,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1364
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:09,042
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to ask her next week.

1365
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:11,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I remember.

1366
01:48:11,702 --> 01:48:12,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another email.

1367
01:48:12,843 --> 01:48:14,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Dan Shadow.

1368
01:48:14,203 --> 01:48:15,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, survived the gaming season?

1369
01:48:15,923 --> 01:48:17,124
[SPEAKER_04]: What surprised you the most?

1370
01:48:17,984 --> 01:48:19,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, Left 4 Dead blew me away.

1371
01:48:20,004 --> 01:48:23,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be up in the area next weekend, which I believe is this weekend.

1372
01:48:23,185 --> 01:48:23,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

1373
01:48:23,925 --> 01:48:24,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can meet up.

1374
01:48:24,665 --> 01:48:25,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to meet you all.

1375
01:48:26,266 --> 01:48:26,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

1376
01:48:27,654 --> 01:48:33,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully he comes back because apparently he didn't make it out tonight because we were off last week and didn't even ever get to our emails.

1377
01:48:34,804 --> 01:48:36,645
[SPEAKER_04]: are bad.

1378
01:48:36,726 --> 01:48:39,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's our last email tonight from Cheeseburger.

1379
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:42,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR, I want to buy my dad a PlayStation 3 for Christmas.

1380
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:43,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty ambitious.

1381
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:47,614
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got a 52-inch plasma LCD TV and all we have is crappy cable.

1382
01:48:47,994 --> 01:48:50,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you guys and girls think is the best place to buy it?

1383
01:48:51,036 --> 01:48:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: All I want is the Blu-ray player and don't intend on playing any games.

1384
01:48:53,898 --> 01:48:58,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Websites are okay options too as long as I can use my unverified PayPal account.

1385
01:48:59,382 --> 01:49:04,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, in that case, you might just want to go for a used PlayStation 3 from eBay.

1386
01:49:04,659 --> 01:49:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1387
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:28,719
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

1388
01:49:47,458 --> 01:49:47,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Cyber Monday, Tomorrow

1389
01:50:02,859 --> 01:50:21,336
[SPEAKER_04]: so tomorrow would be a good day to kind of check your big retailer websites to look for big deals and the reason why they wait until Monday is because a lot of people do their online shopping at work and Monday's the first day back to work for most people including myself so you're going to see a lot of good deals on Cyber Monday online if that's where you're looking to buy things so keep an eye out

1390
01:50:22,381 --> 01:50:22,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep an eye out.

1391
01:50:23,082 --> 01:50:28,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't be afraid to use sites like Frugal, Google's shopping site, to look for good deals.

1392
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:30,553
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a PS3 is a PS3 is a PS3.

1393
01:50:30,573 --> 01:50:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheap-ass gamer.

1394
01:50:31,774 --> 01:50:35,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a good site, too, especially with games.

1395
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:37,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep an eye out.

1396
01:50:37,963 --> 01:50:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1397
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:53,765
[SPEAKER_05]: it's funny, I was looking in chat they were talking about Commander Keen they actually have ported a clone of Commander Keen for the Wii, it's in their homebrew community now, you can download Commander Keen for the Wii that's kind of neat

1398
01:50:54,605 --> 01:51:01,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one more email from Rob with two B's about the Wii and says, this one's for Matt.

1399
01:51:01,467 --> 01:51:03,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I recently upgraded my Wii firmware.

1400
01:51:03,347 --> 01:51:03,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

1401
01:51:03,927 --> 01:51:06,448
[SPEAKER_04]: My SD card was completely wiped clean.

1402
01:51:06,848 --> 01:51:09,668
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a shame because I don't have a homebrew channel or anything on it.

1403
01:51:09,688 --> 01:51:10,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear of anything similar?

1404
01:51:11,569 --> 01:51:15,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I had painstakingly backed up my game channel so that I wouldn't need to download them again.

1405
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:19,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Some I deleted from my Wii memory because of the incredible daunting size of WiiWare.

1406
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:20,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Grr, argh.

1407
01:51:21,672 --> 01:51:31,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, here's the thing, um, I didn't update my system at all because I don't connect to their, you know, internet for, I don't connect to the store.

1408
01:51:31,344 --> 01:51:37,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Because to be honest, I don't buy anything on there and there's nothing I need to download and if I wanted to download...

1409
01:51:37,912 --> 01:51:38,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1410
01:51:56,959 --> 01:52:04,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless I get a WeSpeak microphone, I'll need to update it for the WeSpeak channel, which I probably still wouldn't do because I wouldn't use that.

1411
01:52:04,561 --> 01:52:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no, I haven't updated it yet.

1412
01:52:07,142 --> 01:52:18,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, if you have updated it, I believe there's a new Twilight hack out now for the 3.4 firmware, and you can download that and redo all your stuff if you need to.

1413
01:52:19,165 --> 01:52:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds to me, though, that Rob is not into this whole hacking homebrew thing at all, like me.

1414
01:52:24,428 --> 01:52:27,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not into it because I don't have time.

1415
01:52:27,629 --> 01:52:30,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So why did his SD card get picked on?

1416
01:52:30,551 --> 01:52:40,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know why it wiped your SD card unless you had modified saves on there or something, but unless they're trying to get you to update it.

1417
01:52:41,677 --> 01:52:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why they would want you to re-download everything.

1418
01:52:43,978 --> 01:52:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make any sense.

1419
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:45,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

1420
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:50,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Nintendo sucks.

1421
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,262
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Team Twizers or Tweezers or whatever they're called.

1422
01:53:16,442 --> 01:53:23,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's other games that they've already figured out exploits to that can be used instead of Twilight Princess.

1423
01:53:23,106 --> 01:53:25,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So this by all means is not an end.

1424
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:29,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that's going to do it for tonight's Mailbag.

1425
01:53:29,230 --> 01:53:33,032
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send us an email, DarkSakura will hopefully be back next week to read your emails.

1426
01:53:36,966 --> 01:53:41,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, other fun stuff that's going to be going on here.

1427
01:53:41,807 --> 01:53:48,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this isn't really fun, but FunCom, the company behind such wonderful games like The Age of Conan.

1428
01:53:49,349 --> 01:53:51,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they've had to cut staff.

1429
01:53:51,789 --> 01:53:59,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, hard times have been had, and last Tuesday they actually had to...

1430
01:54:01,673 --> 01:54:04,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, plus just Age of Conan I don't think lived up to expectations.

1431
01:54:04,635 --> 01:54:11,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there were a lot of people that bought that, played the one month trial, and didn't stay with it.

1432
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:13,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I could see that.

1433
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:30,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to check out the game, but just kind of never got around to it.

1434
01:54:31,005 --> 01:54:33,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it seems to be going the way of Tabula Rasa, which is kind of sad.

1435
01:54:35,378 --> 01:54:39,480
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of MMOs out there and Warcraft is kind of owning a lot of them in the face.

1436
01:54:40,181 --> 01:54:42,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Only very few are able to hold their own against it.

1437
01:54:42,322 --> 01:54:58,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what though, if you like God of War and you own a 360 and will have never an opportunity to play God of War on the 360, you should check out Conan, the actual Conan game that they released because it is such a blatant ripoff of God of War, it's not even funny.

1438
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's boobies and lots of blood and that's all you really need.

1439
01:55:04,835 --> 01:55:05,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's all you need.

1440
01:55:06,678 --> 01:55:08,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, PC games.

1441
01:55:09,101 --> 01:55:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Really old PC games, but really classic PC games.

1442
01:55:13,306 --> 01:55:19,234
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft is over 10 years old and just got patched this past week to patch 1.16.

1443
01:55:21,357 --> 01:55:24,458
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1444
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:50,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll only use as much as it needs.

1445
01:55:50,812 --> 01:55:52,853
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some other tiny little exploits, too.

1446
01:55:52,913 --> 01:55:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It does some little exploits with the Zerg race, especially, that were fixed.

1447
01:55:57,757 --> 01:56:03,261
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's great that Blizzard is still patching this game 10 years later.

1448
01:56:04,822 --> 01:56:08,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have somebody in chat, VXXXV, is like, I've been waiting for that.

1449
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:11,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And Korea rejoices.

1450
01:56:11,466 --> 01:56:12,007
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1451
01:56:14,197 --> 01:56:15,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's neat about that?

1452
01:56:15,178 --> 01:56:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make a lot of people go back and re-look at StarCraft.

1453
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:20,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the Burnout Paradise thing.

1454
01:56:20,881 --> 01:56:26,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to keep your game alive even after maybe it's kind of been cut out.

1455
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:34,212
[SPEAKER_05]: While there's some interesting stuff coming out, of course, some more download content for Rock Band, the weekly stuff.

1456
01:56:34,892 --> 01:56:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: This week they actually have a new free track that you can download, which is the track Headphones On by Miranda Cosgrove.

1457
01:56:43,014 --> 01:56:49,115
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be released alongside a bunch of other songs, including Are You Dead Yet?

1458
01:56:49,175 --> 01:56:50,355
[SPEAKER_05]: by the Children of Bottom.

1459
01:56:52,236 --> 01:56:56,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like Finley with Tato E. Possible.

1460
01:56:58,190 --> 01:57:00,472
[SPEAKER_05]: and these are all European bands, by the way.

1461
01:57:03,053 --> 01:57:05,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is kind of weird, Naked Brothers Band.

1462
01:57:05,374 --> 01:57:09,517
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got Body I Occupy and I Don't Want to Go to School.

1463
01:57:10,537 --> 01:57:12,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess crossing over to the Nickelodeon crowd there.

1464
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:17,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Pilatero Y2 with Hey Poco Rock and Roll.

1465
01:57:18,895 --> 01:57:24,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeeze with Tempted, Tokyo Hotel with Ready, Set, Go.

1466
01:57:25,418 --> 01:57:26,079
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

1467
01:57:26,559 --> 01:57:29,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And All American Rejects with Real World.

1468
01:57:29,841 --> 01:57:40,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And it should be noted that all these are for 80 Microsoft points instead of the usual 160, and they're only on sale, I believe, for the month of December.

1469
01:57:41,658 --> 01:57:44,040
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that, they will go back up to their normal price.

1470
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Sales everywhere for the holiday season.

1471
01:57:47,042 --> 01:57:51,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, they had a lot of sales actually on the PlayStation Network, and so there's a bunch of titles that were half off.

1472
01:57:51,406 --> 01:57:51,726
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1473
01:57:51,826 --> 01:57:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't even talk about it during my gaming week, but I got to play Echo Chrome.

1474
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:56,310
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend has a game, Echo Chrome.

1475
01:57:57,444 --> 01:57:59,427
[SPEAKER_04]: What a strange little puzzle game.

1476
01:58:00,268 --> 01:58:02,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun, but I don't know.

1477
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:04,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's now the right price, $5.

1478
01:58:06,657 --> 01:58:09,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But I noticed they have all these user-created levels and things.

1479
01:58:09,361 --> 01:58:10,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty chill game.

1480
01:58:11,023 --> 01:58:11,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way to put it.

1481
01:58:11,764 --> 01:58:12,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chill, chill-out game.

1482
01:58:13,806 --> 01:58:21,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Flow.

1483
01:58:21,628 --> 01:58:22,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that game?

1484
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:23,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1485
01:58:23,289 --> 01:58:23,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1486
01:58:23,949 --> 01:58:27,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back and played a little bit of that because Nellie's like, what's that?

1487
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:29,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of relaxing music there.

1488
01:58:29,390 --> 01:58:31,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, it's this game Flow.

1489
01:58:31,611 --> 01:58:32,771
[SPEAKER_05]: You move the controller around.

1490
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:34,992
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I don't want to have to move the controller around like that.

1491
01:58:35,572 --> 01:58:36,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, too bad.

1492
01:58:39,533 --> 01:58:39,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1493
01:58:40,512 --> 01:58:47,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in other news, apparently obsessive gamers are not necessarily addicted to games.

1494
01:58:47,754 --> 01:58:53,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently 90% of hardcore gamers do not have a legitimate addiction problem.

1495
01:58:53,596 --> 01:59:01,579
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from a brand new survey mainly focused on I think some of the WoW players and stuff.

1496
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:04,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course there's all sorts of disorders out there.

1497
01:59:06,175 --> 01:59:12,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people just take their hobbies a little bit more seriously than others, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't stop.

1498
01:59:13,681 --> 01:59:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I think I can't stop, so maybe I have a problem.

1499
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:19,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not.

1500
01:59:21,647 --> 01:59:23,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not playing well, so that's already saying something.

1501
01:59:23,549 --> 01:59:25,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute, what are you trying to say?

1502
01:59:25,851 --> 01:59:28,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I power on the Xbox, there you are in Saints Row 2.

1503
01:59:28,953 --> 01:59:32,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only going to play that until I'm done with it, and then once I'm done with it, then...

1504
01:59:34,312 --> 01:59:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1505
01:59:58,070 --> 02:00:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what's interesting about these expansions is that there's no new classes.

1506
02:00:03,272 --> 02:00:07,334
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of big things that are expanded here.

1507
02:00:07,374 --> 02:00:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: They're story expansions.

1508
02:00:09,475 --> 02:00:15,038
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only going to be downloadable through the PlayOnline viewer, and they are all supposed to come out in spring 2009.

1509
02:00:15,778 --> 02:00:16,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I take that back.

1510
02:00:16,958 --> 02:00:20,600
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is supposed to come out in spring 2009 with the other two following.

1511
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:24,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is called A Crystalline Prophecy, Ode of Life Bestowing.

1512
02:00:25,502 --> 02:00:27,344
[SPEAKER_04]: A Shantoto Ascension, The Legend Torn, Her Empire Born

1513
02:00:52,105 --> 02:00:53,166
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1514
02:01:12,839 --> 02:01:18,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they'd overhaul the engine to make it newer, gen graphics and all that stuff.

1515
02:01:18,941 --> 02:01:22,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I could take it if they released a new Final Fantasy Online game.

1516
02:01:23,322 --> 02:01:24,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you go back, you think?

1517
02:01:24,622 --> 02:01:25,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1518
02:01:25,342 --> 02:01:27,123
[SPEAKER_04]: If they fixed it.

1519
02:01:27,243 --> 02:01:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first effort.

1520
02:01:28,523 --> 02:01:32,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I hear this whole level sync thing really helped.

1521
02:01:34,088 --> 02:01:45,836
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole thing where basically if you're a level 75, you can downgrade yourself in level and all your gear will scale so that you can level up with your level 40 friend who can't find a party because he's level 40 and level with them.

1522
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:47,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And you both gain experience.

1523
02:01:47,997 --> 02:01:48,617
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that'd be nice.

1524
02:01:48,877 --> 02:01:53,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh my god, that's what that game needed three fucking years ago.

1525
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:57,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just level down to level 1 and just grind down there.

1526
02:01:57,603 --> 02:01:58,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

1527
02:01:58,423 --> 02:01:59,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, exactly.

1528
02:01:59,264 --> 02:02:00,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be awesome.

1529
02:02:00,945 --> 02:02:01,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1530
02:02:07,966 --> 02:02:14,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I throw gamers and WoW players in two different categories.

1531
02:02:15,148 --> 02:02:18,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already starting to get a little offended here.

1532
02:02:18,989 --> 02:02:22,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a friend whose behavior completely transforms when he plays WoW.

1533
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:24,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye social interaction.

1534
02:02:24,371 --> 02:02:26,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, he's just fine when playing other games.

1535
02:02:27,861 --> 02:02:30,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow is kind of a social game though, you know, in a way.

1536
02:02:32,704 --> 02:02:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an old saying though, amongst people who know better, real life greater than wow.

1537
02:02:38,747 --> 02:02:43,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't put wow first before real life commitments.

1538
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:46,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy Online just felt really different.

1539
02:02:46,111 --> 02:02:46,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like kind of...

1540
02:02:48,112 --> 02:03:02,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool because when I first started, it was like, oh my god, you know, you think when you first get to the first force and stuff, it's so big, and then you're like, oh, there's planes beyond that.

1541
02:03:02,101 --> 02:03:07,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, holy crap, it's actually discovering the world and stuff, and then you go through all of it, and then it's like, eh.

1542
02:03:07,405 --> 02:03:11,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the first time you board an airship, you're like, this is so fucking epic, and you know, just all this.

1543
02:03:12,168 --> 02:03:14,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never forget the first time getting on a ship.

1544
02:03:15,083 --> 02:03:41,154
[SPEAKER_04]: in Final Fantasy XI and then pirates fucking attacked the ship and I was like, oh my god, this is so scary and I was like having to run into the basement of the ship and lock yourself in there while the higher level characters were taking out the things but I thought that was so amazing how you would basically be forced to work together with the other players to take out the threat or you all die, basically it was neat or you have to lock yourself in the basement like a scared little kid like I did

1545
02:03:41,613 --> 02:03:44,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, and they do some of those area effect spells and it might still hit you anyway.

1546
02:03:44,896 --> 02:03:45,336
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1547
02:03:45,796 --> 02:03:48,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Swipe back into the corner and cry.

1548
02:03:48,859 --> 02:03:50,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Curl into it slash fetal.

1549
02:03:53,462 --> 02:03:56,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, gosh, that's going to do it, believe it or not, for tonight's gaming news.

1550
02:03:56,384 --> 02:04:06,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit of a slow news week this week, but hey, that just leaves us some time to get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio while we wait for some calls.

1551
02:04:06,852 --> 02:04:08,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last minute things you want to talk about, Loki?

1552
02:04:10,835 --> 02:04:10,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1553
02:04:13,419 --> 02:04:13,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1554
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:16,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can think about it, because we've got a call coming in.

1555
02:04:16,901 --> 02:04:18,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1556
02:04:18,202 --> 02:04:18,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1557
02:04:20,103 --> 02:04:21,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Spazinator.

1558
02:04:22,484 --> 02:04:23,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator.

1559
02:04:23,345 --> 02:04:24,245
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, dude?

1560
02:04:26,106 --> 02:04:42,255
[SPEAKER_08]: This may be kind of a downer for the show, but I'm kind of a wit's end right here, and I could use a little help from the All Games Radio audience at large, specifically any listeners that may be in the Buffalo area.

1561
02:04:43,189 --> 02:05:07,477
[SPEAKER_08]: As I had mentioned to Loki in a private message earlier in the week on Xbox Live, I just recently had my PlayStation 3 stolen, and I'm hoping that any listeners out there that may be in the Buffalo area may have heard

1562
02:05:08,268 --> 02:05:33,397
[SPEAKER_08]: or seeing something through Grapevine, maybe Rumor, seeing someone that normally doesn't have a PlayStation 3 on them and could relay any information to the Buffalo Police Department, specifically District E. Basically, any kind of lead would be great because, well, it's kind of like too full for me.

1563
02:05:33,717 --> 02:05:37,218
[SPEAKER_08]: A, it's not exactly something I can easily replace.

1564
02:05:38,155 --> 02:05:59,441
[SPEAKER_08]: and B, while it should be fairly evident that I'm disabled and the PlayStation 3 X is like a coping skill for me in dealing with my disability and subsequently after my disability has been acted up and I've been getting

1565
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:03,171
[SPEAKER_08]: and some things like that.

1566
02:06:29,645 --> 02:06:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way I could kind of like... As long as you only have one user, it will do that.

1567
02:06:32,847 --> 02:06:35,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it will sit in the select user screen type thing.

1568
02:06:37,329 --> 02:06:40,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, technically my profile did.

1569
02:06:41,391 --> 02:06:46,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And the key thing was it had my credit card information on there.

1570
02:06:46,654 --> 02:06:51,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And because of that, I really did two things.

1571
02:06:53,140 --> 02:07:07,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I canceled my credit card and no idea if I was able to remote access my account using my PSP to change the password on my PlayStation Network account.

1572
02:07:07,738 --> 02:07:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: That way no one could get onto the profile and buy anything.

1573
02:07:12,549 --> 02:07:19,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Any chance that you called Sony and see, I don't know if they would do this, but maybe if you've told them what happened, see what the last IP was to access it?

1574
02:07:20,191 --> 02:07:20,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1575
02:07:20,772 --> 02:07:21,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reaching here.

1576
02:07:21,692 --> 02:07:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you can do in these scenarios, but that would be my first thought, is to call Sony and see when the last time that thing signed in was.

1577
02:07:27,474 --> 02:07:36,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I did bring this up, and in fact, I thought up the same thing, and the only thing they can do is,

1578
02:07:38,277 --> 02:07:49,187
[SPEAKER_08]: If I were to have left my password as was, the only thing they could do is see if anyone would try to input their own credit card information onto my profile.

1579
02:07:50,228 --> 02:08:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they did, I would have their name and address and whatnot, but at the same time as

1580
02:08:01,867 --> 02:08:17,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not totally sure, but I think it's kind of iffy because if they input their credit card information, chances are they could also change my password too, and even I won't be able to access my own account, you know?

1581
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems a little weak from Sony.

1582
02:08:19,882 --> 02:08:22,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there'd be a little more they could do to help in this situation.

1583
02:08:22,964 --> 02:08:25,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they need a police report or something to be able to do it.

1584
02:08:25,647 --> 02:08:26,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

1585
02:08:26,547 --> 02:08:28,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I've never been in this situation, but...

1586
02:08:29,329 --> 02:08:32,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, buddy, I hope it helps for whatever reason.

1587
02:08:32,812 --> 02:08:42,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if anybody has heard of anything about this, let us know and we'll forward it over to Spazinator or just contact the police for heaven's sake.

1588
02:08:43,821 --> 02:08:44,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And this goes in general.

1589
02:08:45,102 --> 02:08:51,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess we could kind of turn this into more of a community thing for everybody in all parts of the U.S.

1590
02:08:51,327 --> 02:08:55,531
[SPEAKER_04]: because unfortunately it leaves gamers like Spazinator in the cold if we support...

1591
02:08:56,031 --> 02:08:58,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, purchasing these stolen systems and things like that.

1592
02:08:58,753 --> 02:09:03,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you know of these things going on, do the right thing and let police people know.

1593
02:09:04,618 --> 02:09:05,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, really.

1594
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:07,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks for your support.

1595
02:09:07,601 --> 02:09:09,262
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely appreciated.

1596
02:09:09,362 --> 02:09:13,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I'll get some good news soon, you know.

1597
02:09:13,866 --> 02:09:15,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we're hoping for you, Spazinator.

1598
02:09:15,488 --> 02:09:16,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep us posted.

1599
02:09:17,289 --> 02:09:17,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I will do.

1600
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, good luck, buddy.

1601
02:09:20,452 --> 02:09:20,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, bye-bye.

1602
02:09:21,032 --> 02:09:21,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1603
02:09:22,233 --> 02:09:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, what a bummer.

1604
02:09:24,414 --> 02:09:25,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to ask how it was stolen.

1605
02:09:25,681 --> 02:09:27,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the house didn't get broken into or something like that.

1606
02:09:29,238 --> 02:09:30,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes, not a fun situation.

1607
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:32,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1608
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:32,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1609
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Time of day, Orange Lounge Radio land.

1610
02:09:34,962 --> 02:09:35,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Jason.

1611
02:09:35,762 --> 02:09:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jason.

1612
02:09:36,382 --> 02:09:37,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have some better news.

1613
02:09:37,283 --> 02:09:38,624
[SPEAKER_04]: The last call was a little bit of a downer.

1614
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was hearing bits and pieces because I was helping Ryan with something and trying to make sure all the volumes are set nicely in here and whatnot.

1615
02:09:46,328 --> 02:09:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Ryan?

1616
02:09:47,609 --> 02:09:48,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

1617
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:49,410
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Ryan?

1618
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:50,011
[SPEAKER_02]: How is she doing?

1619
02:09:50,451 --> 02:09:51,291
[SPEAKER_02]: She's busy.

1620
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:52,192
[SPEAKER_02]: She's in school now.

1621
02:09:53,293 --> 02:09:57,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I know she used to listen to the show back in the day but hasn't had enough time lately, but let her know we said hello.

1622
02:09:58,456 --> 02:09:58,876
[SPEAKER_02]: They said hello.

1623
02:10:00,103 --> 02:10:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's right there.

1624
02:10:01,024 --> 02:10:01,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

1625
02:10:01,584 --> 02:10:03,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's listening over my shoulder.

1626
02:10:03,225 --> 02:10:04,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, wonderful, wonderful.

1627
02:10:05,286 --> 02:10:05,966
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, Jason?

1628
02:10:07,107 --> 02:10:10,709
[SPEAKER_02]: That StarCraft news was really good to hear.

1629
02:10:10,949 --> 02:10:12,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you get all excited in chat.

1630
02:10:13,331 --> 02:10:18,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is something that dates back to when I lived in New Mexico in like, I don't know, maybe 2001 or 2002?

1631
02:10:19,394 --> 02:10:20,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe 10 years ago, Jason?

1632
02:10:21,755 --> 02:10:22,856
[SPEAKER_02]: With how old this game is?

1633
02:10:23,156 --> 02:10:23,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not that early, but...

1634
02:10:24,657 --> 02:10:45,265
[SPEAKER_02]: When I remember, the thing that sticks out most in my mind, this is going to be the weirdest thing I've ever really said, but the thing that sticks out most in my mind is just how far back reaching this goes in the sense that the fact that online replays were able to be saved at, I don't know, 1.03 or something like that.

1635
02:10:45,826 --> 02:10:51,388
[SPEAKER_02]: When that feature came out, that was amazing, especially because the file size for any average game was less than 10k.

1636
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:57,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I first did it, I played a couple games with some people, and then I went back and watched the replays.

1637
02:10:57,405 --> 02:10:58,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, wait a second.

1638
02:10:58,887 --> 02:11:01,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I was discussing with them strategy and whatnot.

1639
02:11:01,751 --> 02:11:02,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see that too.

1640
02:11:02,732 --> 02:11:03,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Never could.

1641
02:11:03,614 --> 02:11:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: They just now put this in.

1642
02:11:07,238 --> 02:11:11,304
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my high school life coming back to say, hey, I'm cool again.

1643
02:11:12,483 --> 02:11:13,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that weird?

1644
02:11:13,584 --> 02:11:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why would they add that now, of all things?

1645
02:11:16,765 --> 02:11:18,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that so strange?

1646
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:38,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I started playing through the campaigns again, and it was fun, it still is.

1647
02:11:38,353 --> 02:11:46,383
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other little features in the patch we didn't mention is that now you can use slash R to reply directly to the person you last talked to, that's another new feature in the patch.

1648
02:11:46,823 --> 02:11:52,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Warcraft thing, which I thought was kind of funny, because that's exactly what you do in WoW, to reply to people.

1649
02:11:52,030 --> 02:11:53,031
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of a surprise, woo!

1650
02:11:53,311 --> 02:11:53,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1651
02:11:54,531 --> 02:11:55,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Synergy amongst the thing.

1652
02:11:56,031 --> 02:11:59,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of WoW, I know you didn't call the talk WoW, but I've got to mention this.

1653
02:11:59,312 --> 02:12:06,273
[SPEAKER_04]: The Armory got a huge upgrade this week, and those achievements that you've been getting on your character, now you can look at them in the Armory online.

1654
02:12:06,633 --> 02:12:12,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But not only that, like, if I were to look, like, I've got to show Loki this, because he's a big achievement whore, so he'd kind of think this is funny.

1655
02:12:12,494 --> 02:12:13,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm explaining what I'm doing.

1656
02:12:13,434 --> 02:12:17,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to the Armory right now, and I'm looking up the achievements for my character, okay?

1657
02:12:17,895 --> 02:12:18,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, look at this.

1658
02:12:18,715 --> 02:12:22,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It breaks down exactly which achievements I have and what categories and all that, but not just that.

1659
02:12:23,137 --> 02:12:26,126
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to look at a particular achievement, let's say general.

1660
02:12:26,627 --> 02:12:29,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one achievement I've been going for lately is...

1661
02:12:30,765 --> 02:12:32,426
[SPEAKER_04]: to all the squirrels I've loved before.

1662
02:12:32,526 --> 02:12:35,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Show the critters of Azeroth how much you slash love them.

1663
02:12:35,528 --> 02:12:40,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a 10-point achievement if you're able to find every little creature in Azeroth and type slash love, right?

1664
02:12:41,273 --> 02:12:52,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not only is the armory tracking that I have that achievement enough, but if I click on it, it shows exactly which six I've slash loved and which ones I have yet to do.

1665
02:12:52,801 --> 02:12:54,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fairly comprehensive.

1666
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:24,917
[SPEAKER_04]: integration like this is a great thing it's always 10 years delayed in StarCraft's case but anything like this to integrate that much you don't have to start up the entire game just to see this information it's almost always a good thing to have and I also want to show Loki this I can put in my ex-boyfriend's account and compare and I can see right there no no but I can see just I can notice that I have 360 more achievement points than he does and that makes me feel better about myself awesome there you go

1667
02:13:26,482 --> 02:13:28,282
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Rob's not an achievement whore.

1668
02:13:28,362 --> 02:13:29,863
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.

1669
02:13:33,563 --> 02:13:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just sad and pathetic.

1670
02:13:35,404 --> 02:13:36,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so back to StarCraft.

1671
02:13:36,984 --> 02:13:40,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share about what's going on?

1672
02:13:41,085 --> 02:13:44,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to see what the StarCraft 2 requirements are going to be.

1673
02:13:45,146 --> 02:13:54,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like it's coming out holiday season or anything, so I shouldn't be jumping the gun or anything, but it's going to be... Wasn't it either that or Diablo 3 that isn't actually likely before 2010?

1674
02:13:56,879 --> 02:14:00,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I remember hearing something about that, but yeah, that makes sense.

1675
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:04,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you we see, I bet you we'll finally get StarCraft 2 next year.

1676
02:14:04,281 --> 02:14:06,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was playable at PAX, for heaven's sake.

1677
02:14:07,442 --> 02:14:11,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It will probably be out next year, just in time for the holidays, and then you'll probably get Diablo 3 in 2010.

1678
02:14:12,521 --> 02:14:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in time to buy three games.

1679
02:14:15,662 --> 02:14:17,622
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've already beat that topic to death.

1680
02:14:17,662 --> 02:14:24,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Consider we're one month away from 2009 and 2010 doesn't seem that far off because that's probably when we're going to see Final Fantasy XIII as well.

1681
02:14:24,503 --> 02:14:27,224
[SPEAKER_02]: This year went by so fast.

1682
02:14:28,204 --> 02:14:30,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was a crazy year.

1683
02:14:31,225 --> 02:14:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, buddy.

1684
02:14:31,765 --> 02:14:33,345
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let you go to get to more calls, all right?

1685
02:14:33,925 --> 02:14:34,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Such is life.

1686
02:14:35,425 --> 02:14:35,706
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1687
02:14:35,866 --> 02:14:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, buddy.

1688
02:14:36,986 --> 02:14:37,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, folks.

1689
02:14:37,826 --> 02:14:37,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1690
02:14:40,236 --> 02:14:40,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot.

1691
02:14:40,876 --> 02:14:42,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to call in last week because of where I was.

1692
02:15:05,645 --> 02:15:07,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, failed, I know.

1693
02:15:07,867 --> 02:15:09,988
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I saw the pictures in your live journal.

1694
02:15:10,028 --> 02:15:11,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about the trip you went on.

1695
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:16,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And where exactly did you go in San Francisco?

1696
02:15:16,793 --> 02:15:17,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a few different places.

1697
02:15:17,533 --> 02:15:17,893
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a

1698
02:15:35,874 --> 02:15:43,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, well we saw the Blacks Museum, so what I wanted to call about was this incredible arcade that I got to go to.

1699
02:15:48,629 --> 02:15:56,598
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a whole bunch of old games, like this link I'm posting is an old arcade, it's an old pinball game.

1700
02:15:58,689 --> 02:16:00,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Which arcade was this at?

1701
02:16:00,791 --> 02:16:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I go to San Francisco quite often, and I, for some reason, have decided to never seek, I somehow have never seeked this place out.

1702
02:16:07,357 --> 02:16:11,861
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know the Pier 39 arcade and some of those other things, but where exactly was this, and how did you find it?

1703
02:16:12,862 --> 02:16:14,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, I don't remember.

1704
02:16:15,144 --> 02:16:22,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to ask about it, but... Well, what made you think to go there?

1705
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:25,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it was my mom's suggestion.

1706
02:16:28,542 --> 02:16:29,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thunk it?

1707
02:16:29,943 --> 02:16:30,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1708
02:16:30,263 --> 02:16:31,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, on my photo bucket.

1709
02:16:31,144 --> 02:16:31,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1710
02:16:31,264 --> 02:16:31,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1711
02:16:56,862 --> 02:16:58,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

1712
02:17:01,046 --> 02:17:07,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

1713
02:17:09,474 --> 02:17:09,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1714
02:17:10,014 --> 02:17:15,760
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the games I was playing, one of the games I was playing in San Francisco was the old 1976 game Death Race.

1715
02:17:18,808 --> 02:17:19,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, this game.

1716
02:17:20,089 --> 02:17:21,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, that's an old, old game.

1717
02:17:21,849 --> 02:17:24,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember that coming up on the show not that long ago.

1718
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:27,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, what did you think?

1719
02:17:27,672 --> 02:17:29,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to play that, and what did you think?

1720
02:17:30,693 --> 02:17:32,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.

1721
02:17:32,934 --> 02:17:37,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I even made a remake for the PC.

1722
02:17:37,916 --> 02:17:42,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to dig that up and link it in chat, too.

1723
02:17:43,278 --> 02:17:43,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1724
02:17:44,568 --> 02:17:46,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tattoo, you have a good one, buddy.

1725
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:47,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take some more calls.

1726
02:18:14,796 --> 02:18:15,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, bud.

1727
02:18:15,716 --> 02:18:15,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1728
02:18:44,799 --> 02:18:45,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's cutting out.

1729
02:18:45,619 --> 02:18:46,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, can you hear me?

1730
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:47,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cutting out a little bit.

1731
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:51,861
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any other things running, like torrents, whatever.

1732
02:18:52,881 --> 02:18:53,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

1733
02:18:55,322 --> 02:18:55,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1734
02:18:55,802 --> 02:18:57,563
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1735
02:19:00,363 --> 02:19:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm hanging up.

1736
02:19:02,384 --> 02:19:03,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.

1737
02:19:05,565 --> 02:19:07,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't usually do this, but we'll try this.

1738
02:19:07,105 --> 02:19:07,945
[SPEAKER_04]: This will sometimes help.

1739
02:19:12,327 --> 02:19:12,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey there, GS68?

1740
02:19:14,611 --> 02:19:15,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's try this shit again.

1741
02:19:15,992 --> 02:19:17,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, it sounds a little better this time.

1742
02:19:17,433 --> 02:19:18,694
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind, GS68?

1743
02:19:20,655 --> 02:19:27,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Well... Okay... Besides that, I'll get around to playing... Well, Echo.

1744
02:19:30,142 --> 02:19:31,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there might be an audio thing going on.

1745
02:19:31,823 --> 02:19:32,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1746
02:19:32,144 --> 02:19:32,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck this shit.

1747
02:19:34,825 --> 02:19:37,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1748
02:19:37,647 --> 02:19:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1749
02:19:38,228 --> 02:19:39,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this shit.

1750
02:19:40,269 --> 02:19:41,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Works Launch Radio.

1751
02:19:41,730 --> 02:19:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1752
02:19:44,747 --> 02:19:46,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow, what happened at year 68?

1753
02:19:48,529 --> 02:19:49,809
[SPEAKER_03]: He got a little frustrated.

1754
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:51,770
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1755
02:19:51,810 --> 02:19:52,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1756
02:19:53,231 --> 02:19:54,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is Osfer.

1757
02:19:54,771 --> 02:19:56,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Osfer, what's on your mind?

1758
02:19:58,253 --> 02:19:59,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry I tuned in a little bit late.

1759
02:19:59,834 --> 02:20:01,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you covered this story or not.

1760
02:20:01,674 --> 02:20:05,716
[SPEAKER_01]: But did you see that part where it was talking... This was on Joystick.

1761
02:20:05,796 --> 02:20:11,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an article about the Zelda director saying he wouldn't quit until he surpasses Ocarina of Time.

1762
02:20:12,379 --> 02:20:14,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he wouldn't quit working with the Zelda series.

1763
02:20:20,817 --> 02:20:30,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, what do you guys think needs to happen in the Zelda series to make it surpass Ocarina of Time?

1764
02:20:30,986 --> 02:20:35,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there's already been a game in the Zelda series that's better than Ocarina of Time?

1765
02:20:38,009 --> 02:21:04,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the way they can make it better is to fuck the shit no um it's just not gonna get old I don't know why I'm so immature yes I think there is a game that has surpassed Ocarina of Time and it's called The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past so in my opinion he can quit already because he already made the better game really I have a friend that likes A Link to the Past the best too but I don't know just for me Ocarina of Time is still the best

1766
02:21:06,496 --> 02:21:09,764
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also talking in terms of sales, too.

1767
02:21:13,282 --> 02:21:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think it's going to be tricky to do.

1768
02:21:15,464 --> 02:21:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Twilight Princess was pretty darn good.

1769
02:21:19,466 --> 02:21:24,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think it really showed what the Wii games could be pretty awesome.

1770
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:28,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, you know, that game was kind of originally designed for the GameCube.

1771
02:21:29,213 --> 02:21:37,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what it really might take to really knock people's socks off is to kind of take that same approach, but with a Zelda game that is designed for the system it's going to be out for.

1772
02:21:37,939 --> 02:21:40,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll probably be this Wii HD thing that'll be out in 2010 or 2011.

1773
02:21:42,301 --> 02:21:46,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Which will be a port of a Wii game, because they'll do a Wii version and a Wii HD version.

1774
02:21:47,064 --> 02:21:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised if we see a play on Wii Wind Waker game.

1775
02:21:54,249 --> 02:22:01,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see a Wind Waker game that wasn't in a world that was flooded with water.

1776
02:22:02,033 --> 02:22:02,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just...

1777
02:22:03,768 --> 02:22:11,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Spoiler, but in Wind Waker you actually go under the ocean and you find out, oh my god, it's Hyrule but flooded and it looks pretty awesome.

1778
02:22:11,838 --> 02:22:16,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, why the fuck couldn't they have just done this and made it really cool?

1779
02:22:17,326 --> 02:22:19,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like Wind Waker to me is kind of like Mega Man Legends was.

1780
02:22:21,513 --> 02:22:22,573
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another game that needs more.

1781
02:22:22,793 --> 02:22:28,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm thinking if Zelda wants to really, really expand its audience and really cater to many people out there.

1782
02:22:28,595 --> 02:22:29,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Crossing.

1783
02:22:29,275 --> 02:22:29,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Different types.

1784
02:22:29,955 --> 02:22:31,096
[SPEAKER_04]: The game that's just persistent.

1785
02:22:31,136 --> 02:22:31,416
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1786
02:22:31,456 --> 02:22:33,836
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do, you just need to add a few things into the game.

1787
02:22:33,856 --> 02:22:35,417
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to add kidditch matches.

1788
02:22:36,457 --> 02:22:38,698
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to add vampires that sparkle.

1789
02:22:40,218 --> 02:22:41,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need to add...

1790
02:22:42,859 --> 02:22:46,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, instead of a wolf, Link turns into a sexy vampire guy, and then Zelda just starts singing See You Again.

1791
02:23:03,259 --> 02:23:04,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're on to something here.

1792
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:08,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he sparkles, and we just talk about how beautiful he is.

1793
02:23:10,181 --> 02:23:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been waiting at midnight.

1794
02:23:11,861 --> 02:23:18,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1795
02:23:18,163 --> 02:23:22,904
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, honestly, the thing that's going to make Zelda better is something we haven't thought of yet.

1796
02:23:24,045 --> 02:23:25,385
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my cryptic answer.

1797
02:23:25,485 --> 02:23:26,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it really is.

1798
02:23:26,385 --> 02:23:27,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something we haven't thought of yet.

1799
02:23:27,326 --> 02:23:28,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Steering wheel controls.

1800
02:23:31,055 --> 02:23:34,179
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something like what Loki said about Wind Waker.

1801
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:38,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be cool if they made a Wii version of it.

1802
02:23:38,605 --> 02:23:40,667
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how you conducted with the Wind Waker?

1803
02:23:40,687 --> 02:23:41,168
[SPEAKER_01]: You could actually...

1804
02:23:41,755 --> 02:23:45,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably do that with the Wii Remote, and that would be just something interesting.

1805
02:23:45,057 --> 02:23:46,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, whatever happened to Link's crossbow training?

1806
02:24:10,521 --> 02:24:10,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy.

1807
02:24:10,821 --> 02:24:15,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it in a CD case to where it would be forgotten.

1808
02:24:16,185 --> 02:24:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Forever.

1809
02:24:17,426 --> 02:24:18,968
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was that thing called?

1810
02:24:19,048 --> 02:24:20,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii Zapper.

1811
02:24:21,409 --> 02:24:22,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the Wii Zapper?

1812
02:24:23,991 --> 02:24:26,133
[SPEAKER_04]: There's games that actually use it, like Call of Duty.

1813
02:24:28,335 --> 02:24:36,401
[SPEAKER_04]: In the next Zelda game, we need more Link's crossbow training with sniper rifles and cannons and things that are more explosive than a stupid crossbow.

1814
02:24:36,421 --> 02:24:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Zelda?

1815
02:24:37,081 --> 02:24:37,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1816
02:24:41,195 --> 02:24:41,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

1817
02:24:42,216 --> 02:24:42,876
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wrong.

1818
02:24:42,976 --> 02:24:51,940
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, seriously, they could just do, you know, the first thing they're probably going to do is just do that play on Wii thing for Wind Waker.

1819
02:24:52,541 --> 02:24:54,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll probably see a new Zelda game.

1820
02:24:55,942 --> 02:24:57,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be on the Wii.

1821
02:24:58,363 --> 02:24:59,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with YYR in chat.

1822
02:24:59,744 --> 02:25:00,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming soon.

1823
02:25:00,665 --> 02:25:03,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Links Crossbow Training Turbo HD Remix.

1824
02:25:07,822 --> 02:25:10,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what they're going to do when they do come out with a Wii HD?

1825
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:15,068
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to remake all the stupid games that were on the Wii, and they're going to make them all HD now.

1826
02:25:15,148 --> 02:25:16,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll buy them anyway, because you're a consumer horror.

1827
02:25:16,949 --> 02:25:17,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And people will buy them.

1828
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:18,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1829
02:25:19,511 --> 02:25:36,425
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Osfer, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, and I know you really didn't get an answer out of us, but I think it's because probably, sure, there could be a game that one day surpasses Zelda if they just want to put the effort into it, and hopefully they will, and appease us hardcore gamers.

1830
02:25:36,505 --> 02:25:36,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1831
02:25:38,106 --> 02:25:43,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you were right, though, when you said that it would have to be something that we haven't seen in a game yet.

1832
02:25:44,071 --> 02:25:47,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the thing with Ocarina of Time for me was just how expansive it was.

1833
02:25:48,214 --> 02:25:54,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that feeling I got when I first stepped out into Hyrule Field, I was just like, holy crap, there's so much to do.

1834
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:58,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's something to be said for the potential of a Zelda MMO.

1835
02:25:59,462 --> 02:25:59,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1836
02:26:00,283 --> 02:26:03,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be a little weird, but, you know, when in doubt, sparkles.

1837
02:26:04,326 --> 02:26:05,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.

1838
02:26:05,347 --> 02:26:06,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, buddy.

1839
02:26:07,368 --> 02:26:07,849
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, see ya.

1840
02:26:08,815 --> 02:26:10,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1841
02:26:11,077 --> 02:26:12,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for your guys' calls.

1842
02:26:12,178 --> 02:26:13,860
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't get through, I'm sorry.

1843
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:18,003
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeonstrater.com and we'll take more calls next week.

1844
02:26:18,604 --> 02:26:20,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Last minute stories to get out of the way before we take off tonight.

1845
02:26:21,326 --> 02:26:25,470
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a bunch of rumors coming out about stuff coming from Sony.

1846
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:28,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this was leaked from some sort of Sony staff meeting.

1847
02:26:30,054 --> 02:26:31,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the stuff we've been hearing about...

1848
02:26:32,776 --> 02:26:33,416
[SPEAKER_05]: over and over now.

1849
02:26:33,777 --> 02:26:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: LittleBigPlanet on the PSP.

1850
02:26:35,677 --> 02:26:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: MotorStorm on the PSP apparently are in the works maybe as early as next year.

1851
02:26:42,879 --> 02:26:43,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised.

1852
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:48,001
[SPEAKER_05]: They need something because there's nothing really coming out on the PSP.

1853
02:26:48,841 --> 02:26:53,882
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that MotorStorm was shown off on the PSP, but it was target footage and not the actual game.

1854
02:26:56,383 --> 02:26:58,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there was supposedly...

1855
02:27:01,463 --> 02:27:03,024
[SPEAKER_05]: God of War 3 stuff shown.

1856
02:27:03,184 --> 02:27:05,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's really awesome looking.

1857
02:27:06,005 --> 02:27:08,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Uncharted 2 also shown.

1858
02:27:08,426 --> 02:27:13,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a big surprise that they're going to make a second Uncharted game and Kills in 2 stuff was shown off as well.

1859
02:27:14,228 --> 02:27:15,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1860
02:27:16,149 --> 02:27:17,050
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of interesting.

1861
02:27:17,630 --> 02:27:21,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Another interesting thing would be the PSP 3000 system.

1862
02:27:21,411 --> 02:27:22,532
[SPEAKER_05]: The new system that came out.

1863
02:27:22,632 --> 02:27:29,015
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things about that was it was pretty impossible to hack the

1864
02:27:29,815 --> 02:27:30,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Custom Firmwares on.

1865
02:27:31,016 --> 02:27:41,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now it's even easier to do that because a mod group has actually released a new tool now called the PSP Light Blue Tool.

1866
02:27:42,163 --> 02:27:53,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it is, is it's a memory card that will act like the Pandora's battery and will allow you to add the custom firmwares to your system.

1867
02:27:54,091 --> 02:27:59,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's funny is it will sell for $30 and apparently it came out last weekend.

1868
02:27:59,895 --> 02:28:01,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of neat.

1869
02:28:02,396 --> 02:28:09,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Then finally, we know about Gardening Mama that's going to be coming to the DS soon.

1870
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:12,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a new trademark being made.

1871
02:28:12,402 --> 02:28:21,047
[SPEAKER_05]: The title is Trademark Pet Shop Mama, and it is actually a port of a DS game that's apparently available now.

1872
02:28:21,787 --> 02:28:23,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mama might have to be euthanized.

1873
02:28:24,049 --> 02:28:26,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mama's getting spread too thin.

1874
02:28:28,631 --> 02:28:39,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Pet Shop Monogatari is the game that's being ported and has everything from penguin washing to apparently a bear that's jumping in the air.

1875
02:28:39,678 --> 02:28:40,359
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

1876
02:28:40,899 --> 02:28:52,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game though that is being ported and thankfully coming to the United States finally, Trackmania DS will be coming thanks to Atlus March 17th to the US.

1877
02:28:53,207 --> 02:28:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool because Trackmania is all sorts of awesome.

1878
02:28:57,506 --> 02:29:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a Mama game where Mama is trapped in Silent Hill.

1879
02:29:01,608 --> 02:29:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Fix this, Mama!

1880
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Mama's brothel.

1881
02:29:09,291 --> 02:29:09,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Stripping Mama?

1882
02:29:10,992 --> 02:29:11,652
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

1883
02:29:12,052 --> 02:29:12,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Milfing Mama?

1884
02:29:14,033 --> 02:29:15,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something I would just like to bring up.

1885
02:29:16,854 --> 02:29:18,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the fuck's PlayStation Home?

1886
02:29:19,625 --> 02:29:21,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it should have been released by now.

1887
02:29:41,107 --> 02:29:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kind of curious, you know, that they promised it's supposed to be here for 2008.

1888
02:29:44,409 --> 02:29:45,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So what?

1889
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:46,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

1890
02:29:46,630 --> 02:29:47,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't get into Home.

1891
02:29:47,511 --> 02:29:47,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

1892
02:29:47,891 --> 02:29:48,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that shit.

1893
02:29:48,771 --> 02:29:49,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't care.

1894
02:29:50,112 --> 02:29:51,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, you know, yeah, fuck that shit.

1895
02:29:51,613 --> 02:29:59,997
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think it's funny, though, that they still haven't come out with something, you know, even though they've been teasing this for over two years.

1896
02:30:00,478 --> 02:30:02,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And hell, it's still in the commercials.

1897
02:30:02,559 --> 02:30:04,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're teasing for the PlayStation 3.

1898
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:07,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all these cool games you can play on it, including PlayStation Home.

1899
02:30:07,882 --> 02:30:08,642
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't.

1900
02:30:08,702 --> 02:30:09,783
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot play that.

1901
02:30:11,127 --> 02:30:16,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I love what Joshi16 in chat says, Brittany Mama, where you get to neglect your kids for points.

1902
02:30:16,569 --> 02:30:27,292
[SPEAKER_05]: They were teasing home back in January and December of last year with the new PlayStation 3 commercials with, what was it, Ladies and Gentlemen.

1903
02:30:28,273 --> 02:30:28,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1904
02:30:29,273 --> 02:30:29,653
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sad.

1905
02:30:31,579 --> 02:30:36,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then that's it for the show here tonight on Orange Launch Radio.

1906
02:30:36,525 --> 02:30:40,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was a little bit shorter, but that's what happens when you take a co-host out for a night.

1907
02:30:40,589 --> 02:30:43,733
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting us as you do every week.

1908
02:30:43,753 --> 02:30:47,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, remember, if you like your Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.

1909
02:30:47,097 --> 02:30:48,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell two friends about the show.

1910
02:30:48,358 --> 02:30:49,259
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really how we...

1911
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:52,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread the word about the show because we are an independent podcast.

1912
02:30:52,741 --> 02:30:56,582
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have any big name magazines or big websites backing us.

1913
02:30:56,642 --> 02:30:59,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just us as it always has been for the past seven years.

1914
02:31:00,163 --> 02:31:02,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And without fans, we're nothing.

1915
02:31:03,324 --> 02:31:03,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just crap.

1916
02:31:04,664 --> 02:31:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So we appreciate you guys and your support.

1917
02:31:07,665 --> 02:31:12,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you disagree with me on your particular views on a video game.

1918
02:31:12,306 --> 02:31:13,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, HitStun?

1919
02:31:14,006 --> 02:31:14,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, HitStun?

1920
02:31:16,047 --> 02:31:16,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1921
02:31:18,063 --> 02:31:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1922
02:31:36,866 --> 02:31:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: and the accounts I'm going to take over until, I don't know, tomorrow when he leaves on Tuesday.

1923
02:31:44,936 --> 02:31:47,339
[SPEAKER_05]: So, way to be proactive!

1924
02:31:49,970 --> 02:31:54,073
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is thank you, Aaron, for putting us in the credits of Snake360.

1925
02:31:54,193 --> 02:31:56,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was pretty cool.

1926
02:31:57,396 --> 02:31:58,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot to tell you about that.

1927
02:31:58,557 --> 02:32:01,739
[SPEAKER_04]: In the credit screen, it says special thanks.

1928
02:32:01,839 --> 02:32:05,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Launch Radio, woo!

1929
02:32:05,302 --> 02:32:09,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do we have a gamer pick on Xbox Live, but now we are actually mentioned in a downloadable game.

1930
02:32:09,565 --> 02:32:10,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're all...

1931
02:32:10,766 --> 02:32:15,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we just need to take that big step and actually get the Orange Lounge Radio game released on Xbox 360.

1932
02:32:16,012 --> 02:32:20,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who we have to blow to make that happen, but we might have to get working on that.

1933
02:32:20,056 --> 02:32:21,477
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a New Year's resolution for 09.

1934
02:32:21,797 --> 02:32:23,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you think.

1935
02:32:24,669 --> 02:32:28,391
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, I've thought about it a few times now.

1936
02:32:28,931 --> 02:32:36,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just when you actually get down to figuring it out, game development's really hard.

1937
02:32:36,174 --> 02:32:37,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Game development is hard.

1938
02:32:37,035 --> 02:32:39,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And to make something really good takes a lot of time.

1939
02:32:39,356 --> 02:32:41,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, holy crap, that's a lot of time.

1940
02:32:41,337 --> 02:32:42,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Art is hard, right, Loki?

1941
02:32:42,797 --> 02:32:43,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1942
02:32:43,358 --> 02:32:43,598
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1943
02:32:44,418 --> 02:32:48,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thankfully, what you cannot make yourself, you steal.

1944
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:50,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

1945
02:32:51,388 --> 02:32:53,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

1946
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to say goodnight and get on out of here.

1947
02:32:56,432 --> 02:32:59,475
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week on Orange Lounge Radio for another great show.

1948
02:33:00,155 --> 02:33:02,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Until next time, until next week, fuck this shit.

1949
02:33:03,398 --> 02:33:06,080
