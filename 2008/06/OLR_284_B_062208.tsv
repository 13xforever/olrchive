5700	11700	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11700	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	24000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June 22nd, 2008,
24000	28000	for this Part B of our podcast, our six-year anniversary.
28000	33500	Here doing a show. We started launching our own station over on Live 365, Orange Lounge Radio.
33500	37500	The station itself actually launched in like May, but we considered June when it actually started
37500	43000	because that was our first live program, starring myself and Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.
43000	47500	Loki was a special guest that night, but he worked his way up to a promotion
47500	54000	to being an actual full-time host, and really, it's just like he was a full host the whole time, honestly.
54000	59000	And here we are, so many years later, still doing this little program.
59000	63000	Miggletop is back joining us, Sans Blanket, Sans book. It's almost like he's actually going to participate this evening.
63000	64000	I finished my book.
64000	64500	You did?
64500	65500	Again, I've already read it.
65500	67000	What was it? Do you care to share it with us?
67000	69000	It's called Hero by Perry Moore.
69000	70000	Is it? What's it about?
70000	71000	It's about a superhero.
71000	72000	That's about it. Okay.
72000	73000	It's awesome.
73000	74000	Would it make a good video game?
74000	75000	No.
75000	76000	All right. All right.
76000	79000	But it might be a live action show from what I understand, so yay.
79000	81000	But not like heroes, heroes.
81000	83500	No, because this is better. We wouldn't have a crappy second season.
83500	85500	All right.
85500	87000	Mmm, nice and spinny face.
87000	90000	I've heard of that book. I was actually thinking about picking it up one time.
90000	91500	Then I shall pick it up.
91500	93000	All right.
93000	97000	And I'll actually read it if I pick it up.
97000	99000	We can't hear Shane, so I'm...
99000	100000	All right.
100000	101000	Then shush.
101000	102000	All right.
102000	104000	Going over to Andrew as well as joining us tonight.
104000	106000	You've known him as several different names throughout the years.
106000	109000	There was, let's see, 23rd Magus and Drew Nami.
109000	110000	He's still here.
110000	112500	And was 17 when our show started, which makes me feel old.
112500	114000	And I just won't leave.
114000	115500	I was 19, that means.
115500	116500	Oh, my God.
116500	118500	I'm still the freshman. When's my promotion?
118500	121000	I thought of you the other day.
121000	124500	Hooray. How long ago? Because I might have already been here.
124500	129000	It was about three days ago when I was at Dimple Records looking at High School Musical 2.
129000	130500	Yeah.
130500	135000	Anyhow, let's get back into some video game news, shall we, Loki?
135000	139000	Well, I will not be talking about High School Musical anything.
139000	140000	Yeah.
140000	142500	It's video games, and that's newsworthy.
142500	145500	No, it's not.
145500	153500	But there is some other stuff that's a little bit more newsworthy, and it, I guess, now does have singing involved with it.
153500	156500	But Guitar Hero World Tour.
156500	163000	There's been some brand new previews being shown off, and especially the brand new instruments.
163000	169000	They showed off the brand new drum controller, which looks pretty awesome, actually.
169000	175500	And some of the new features with it, they'll actually, the pads are a lot quieter.
175500	180500	Of course, you may remember that the cymbals are a little bit raised up as well.
180500	185500	And you've got three kind of drums on the bottom, and of course, a kick drum.
185500	186500	Oh, my God.
186500	190500	And also, they will be touch sensitive.
190500	196500	So when you hit them harder, they'll be louder, and so on and so forth.
196500	199500	Some other cool stuff. Also, it's wireless.
199500	209500	Now, on the guitar, remember last week we talked about a certain leak that happened about there being a touch sensitive portion of the guitar?
209500	211500	Well, that turns out to be true.
211500	221500	And actually, the, I guess, brand new touch sensitive slider on the neck will allow you to do all sorts of different things.
221500	222500	What are you doing?
222500	225500	Don't mind the music. I'm trying to prep something else for later.
225500	233500	But they've also got, of course, the standard five buttons as well, and then the whammy bar and that kind of thing.
233500	238500	But it will allow you to do, I guess, new bridges and stuff like that.
238500	239500	So that's kind of cool.
239500	242500	And of course, the usual accelerometer and that sort of thing.
242500	245500	Plus, the guitar just looks kind of neat overall.
245500	256500	And I guess it looks like, yeah, the slider it says will allow you to play with sustained notes by finger sliding up the strip area.
256500	260500	And it says it's also going to be used to tap out notes as well.
260500	262500	So that's kind of cool.
262500	266500	And they have lots of pictures on all your favorite gaming sites.
266500	268500	Of course, we did not carry them.
268500	271500	Alright, so what do you think?
271500	281500	I think it's neat. But, you know, I'm afraid, though, that the Hutch senses a portion on the bottom there for like solos and stuff.
281500	284500	It's enough to make it different than Rock Band.
284500	286500	But that's about it.
286500	290500	You know, if it was buttons, they would have just said, hey, you're ripping off Rock Band.
290500	294500	So, I don't know. I think it's gimmicky.
294500	296500	That's just my opinion.
296500	302500	The guitar looks cool to me, but the drum set totally gave me flashbacks of Drummania.
302500	307500	You know, you move the cymbals out and there you go.
307500	312500	Well, I guess we will see what happens in Guitar Hero.
312500	314500	I mean, are you guys going to get it?
314500	317500	I have it on order, but I don't know.
317500	319500	You might cancel that pre-order?
319500	326500	Yeah, because it's just like, I don't know, I don't play much of Rock Band, so why would I buy another fucking drum set?
326500	334500	I think it looks cool and it might be fun to play, but I'm kind of getting tired of buying peripherals and shit for games.
334500	339500	Especially when, you know, they keep changing the guitar up just enough so that you'll have to buy it each year.
339500	341500	Screw it.
341500	343500	Screw it!
343500	348500	Exactly, and besides, you know, it's neat to do the little like, you know, whammy stuff on there.
348500	354500	They did mention though with the new guitar there's going to be some pretty cool things you can do with the music editor, which is cool if you're into that.
354500	358500	But, I don't know, it's just...
358500	364500	When you look at all the other games, like there's also the Konami Rock Revolution, they have a music editor in there as well.
364500	369500	You can probably assume that Rock Band 2 also is going to have a music editor in there as well.
369500	373500	So it's not like it's something that's going to be exclusive to Guitar Hero.
373500	378500	I don't know, it's just... We haven't really heard of anything about Rock Band 2 yet.
378500	381500	And, to be honest, and we're probably going to cover this a little later...
381500	382500	E3?
382500	386500	Well, yeah, E3, but to be honest, we're probably going to cover this a little bit later.
386500	393500	There are some other peripherals out there for the current games that look pretty kick-ass as well.
393500	396500	And so, I mean, I don't know.
396500	399500	It's an improvement, but it's, I don't think, enough.
399500	404500	Alright, well, moving on, hopefully this is an improvement. Oh, you want to say something?
404500	406500	Oh, well, hold on.
406500	408500	Well, hopefully this is an improvement.
408500	413500	A lot of people were very thrilled about the Xbox 360 Blue Dragon game, although it was okay.
413500	419500	To me, it was like a Super Nintendo RPG on a new system, which isn't necessarily bad, but it did get a little old.
419500	424500	Anyhow, the game still seems to have a pretty good IP behind it,
424500	431500	because they just announced this week that they are going to be making a Blue Dragon collectible card game.
431500	438500	That's right, it's a partnership with Konami Digital Entertainment, with Mistwalker and the folks that did this,
438500	441500	Viz Media, made the partnership to make this game.
441500	445500	You might be wondering, Konami? Card game? Well, yeah, look at Yu-Gi-Oh!
445500	453500	And they're very excited over Konami about this game, coming from Yumi Hoshi, who is the card division VP.
453500	455500	I didn't even know Konami had a card division, but there you go.
455500	462500	Quote, we look forward to reaching out to an array of players of all ages and sharing the excitement of the group-oriented role-playing card game Blue Dragon.
462500	468500	It is our expectation that the character designs of esteemed creator Akira Toriyama, combined with the unique gameplay of Blue Dragon,
468500	471500	will create countless new fans within the card game community.
471500	474500	To which I say, meh.
474500	477500	But we'll see. Maybe there will be something really cool about it, but I don't know.
477500	479500	I want to also mention, because I think I mentioned this before,
479500	485500	but the original, I want to say Guitar Freaks 2 and 3 on, I think it was 2 or 3 or 1,
485500	489500	on the original Playstation had a song editor in it as well.
489500	498500	So this isn't anything really brand new, but I'm sure people will call it innovative, because they forget so soon.
498500	506500	Okay. I guess it takes about 10 years before someone forgets about you, so we have a few more years to go before people actually forget about us.
506500	510500	Well, something that, at least a series that I'm pretty sure no one has really forgotten about,
510500	515500	because Loki brought it up in an earlier part of the show, anyway.
515500	523500	The Raiden series, Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360, hopefully in September, developed by Moss.
523500	532500	And we should be seeing it, actually they're saying in Japan by September, according to Famitsu.
532500	541500	It will have new stages and Xbox Live support, you can share your saved games with people,
541500	548500	and it also supports swivel monitors so that you can use it in the portrait position.
548500	553500	So, you know, a lot of the old shooters used to have that capability, you know.
553500	556500	You could turn your TV on the side and it would work the same way.
556500	564500	So, I think this will be cool, although I don't, you know, don't turn your 15 inch, you know, TVs on their end unless you got a proper stand for it or something.
564500	569500	But, that's pretty cool, I love this game series, it's one of my favorite shooters ever.
569500	572500	So cool.
572500	580500	Well, I'm looking forward to Raiden as well, I know they have that, it's like a compilation of the Raiden, I forget they call it Raiden something.
580500	587500	But, anyways, some other cool stuff coming out to Xbox 360 pretty soon.
587500	595500	And we've heard about this game for quite a while now, but it's apparently being released, I think next week actually, Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.
595500	598500	Yes, it's coming out on June 25th.
598500	605500	And then there's also another game which is kind of along the same lines as Catan or Carcassonne,
605500	614500	but Ticket to Ride is another board game now turned Xbox Live Arcade game that's going to be coming out sometime soon.
614500	616500	I've never heard of this, what's this about?
616500	624500	It's about trains, you actually move, you set up train routes or whatever and whoever has the longest routes you get points and stuff like that.
624500	629500	It's been pretty popular with people like, you know, those other games.
629500	638500	But no word on when that one's coming out, but probably relatively soon, now that it has an Xbox.com page.
638500	641500	Hmm.
641500	644500	Well, I guess we'll see what happens with that.
644500	657500	Oh, and actually the speculation though from Xbox 360 fanboys, that the last time that Xbox pages appeared for unreleased Xbox Live Arcade games,
657500	660500	Frogger 2 and Commando 3, they appeared the very next week.
660500	665500	So, Happy Tree Friends and maybe Ticket to Ride next week, or this week.
665500	671500	Speaking of speculation and the Xbox 360, you remember that big mass of things that leaked last week,
671500	678500	the rumors that were probably taken down by the way the next day, and nobody wants to comment on that whole situation.
678500	683500	One of the games that was revealed in that was Lips, which is a pretty interesting sounding karaoke game,
683500	688500	where you were going to be able to actually put in your own songs and it would actually take out the vocals.
688500	691500	Well, this might make it even cooler. We were kind of joking about this game in part A.
691500	696500	Elite Beat Agents, the team behind Elite Beat Agents was INIS.
696500	699500	INIS was the company behind Elite Beat Agents.
699500	704500	Well, what's kind of interesting is a lot of people have been kind of putting pieces together,
704500	712500	and then an anonymous tipster showed up on Joystiq, apparently saying that INIS is actually the ones that are developing Lips on the Xbox 360.
712500	717500	It kind of makes sense because you already knew that they were working on an Xbox 360 game,
717500	723500	and it was probably going to be music-based. All the pieces are coming together. So, kind of neat.
723500	730500	That just sounds like a game that I recently actually watched a commercial for.
730500	731500	What's that?
731500	735500	Coming out in Japan. For the life of me, I'm trying to remember the name of it.
735500	746500	But it's a karaoke game, and you can actually program your own music into it, as well as sing along with songs that you can enter into it.
746500	751500	And it's something band. I want to say...
751500	757500	And it made me think of Degrassi because the name is similar to it, but I'm trying to find the name of it.
757500	759500	So, give me a second. I'll see if I can't get it.
759500	761500	It's kind of random. It makes you think of Degrassi.
761500	764500	Well, no. The name looks a lot like it.
764500	769500	There needs to be a game about Degrassi because I watch that show religiously.
769500	771500	What would you do in a Degrassi game?
771500	773500	Fawn over Marco.
773500	776500	Shut up.
776500	780500	Yes. We'll not be fawning over Marco.
780500	783500	Maybe Guitar Hero World Tour, though.
783500	789500	Good news, though, and we were kind of worried about this, but like some of the other music games out there,
789500	794500	Guitar Hero 3 downloads will work in Guitar Hero World Tour.
794500	798500	Hooray!
798500	803500	So, you know, if you're worried about downloading all those tracks for Guitar Hero 3,
803500	808500	only to have them not work in the end of October, fear not.
808500	814500	But if you do have to buy a copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, they will not work in that.
814500	817500	Which I don't understand why, but whatever.
817500	827500	Well, in other rock band related news, Offspring is going to be having some songs coming soon.
827500	830500	They're supposed to be...
830500	833500	Well, I mean, this week we already got it then Sevenfold songs,
833500	836500	but Offspring is going to be having...
836500	843500	As soon as my thing goes back to the stupid page, sorry.
843500	845500	There we go.
845500	849500	Sorry, my computer is deciding that it doesn't want to cooperate.
849500	850500	Fly radio?
850500	856500	Come out and play, self-esteem, gone away, all I want, pretty fly for a white guy, and the kids aren't alright.
856500	860500	So, that's according to Offspring's official website.
860500	866500	So now I'll actually have all I want in the game, and I can pretend I'm playing Crazy Taxi.
866500	868500	Sure.
868500	870500	If that's what I want to do.
870500	872500	Sounds like fun.
872500	873500	Yep.
873500	877500	Alright, well what also sounds like fun are these cute little bobbleheads.
877500	883500	They're Halo themed bobbleheads, and they're going to be coming to you at Comic-Con.
883500	885500	So, you actually...
885500	890500	Oh, I found the name of the band, the thing is Digaso Band.
890500	892500	It's kind of like Digasi, a little bit, a little bit.
892500	895500	Well, anyway, this comes from the Bungie's weekly update.
895500	897500	Apparently Halo is actually going to be...
897500	902500	The Bungie is actually going to be at Comic-Con, but only in minimal capacity.
902500	911500	But there will be Microsoft people there, and apparently they're going to actually have Spartan and Master Chief little bobbleheads that they're going to have.
911500	914500	And also they're kind of hyping up the Halo novel.
914500	920500	Because, you know, there's some people that are into actually just getting novelizations about the Halo game.
920500	921500	I don't know.
921500	924500	Have you ever read novels based on video games?
924500	927500	The only ones I ever did were those old, old, old ones by...
927500	929500	What was the name? FX9 or something?
929500	932500	Yeah, like Castlevania.
932500	938500	I actually read the novelizations. A lot of the Warcraft and Starcraft novelizations are fairly well written.
938500	940500	I think you can read a lot of that stuff online.
940500	945500	What kind of stories can people expect to hear in the Warcraft novelizations?
945500	953500	Side stories, alternate retellings of stuff like the War of the Ancients, which happens way, way, way before Warcraft III.
953500	960500	It's actually become canon now. You see a lot of the characters from those novels in World of Warcraft.
960500	966500	Including, like in Eastern Plaguelands, you see some of the novel characters that they added in updates.
966500	973500	And the whole new Sunwell raid is based off the Warcraft manga.
973500	979500	So it's actually fairly deep, if you're interested in such things.
979500	981500	Okay.
981500	987500	Well, I think it's time for us to get to a segment here on Orange Lounge Radio, which we haven't done in a while.
987500	991500	I don't remember the last time we did this segment, actually. It was quite some time ago.
991500	994500	I'm sure over on the wiki, they have it all figured out.
994500	999500	If you want to check out the wiki, it's orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, I want to say it is.
999500	1005500	But we're going to bring back an old segment we haven't done in a while in honor of our sixth anniversary, and it's called Listless.
1005500	1012500	Sorry, I'm just reading this comment in the chat.
1012500	1017500	SSJ100Matt says, no one will buy the novelization because there's no teabagging in it.
1017500	1022500	Before I forget, too, I did post a link to that commercial in the chatroom.
1022500	1025500	It's Digaso Bandbrothers, is what it is.
1025500	1028500	Alright. Well, let's talk about Listless tonight.
1028500	1034500	Listless is a game we like to play here on Orange Lounge Radio where we come up with a definitive list of something.
1034500	1038500	Tonight, that something is going back to our roots, and we're going to take a look.
1038500	1041500	DDR is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.
1041500	1043500	We're looking at the sixth year of Orange Lounge Radio.
1043500	1049500	If you remember, Orange Lounge Radio was formed because DarkSoccer, myself, and Loki all actually met playing DDR at the arcade.
1049500	1052500	I know, crazy, but true. It's how it actually happened.
1052500	1055500	We all met through that and decided to start this radio show because of it.
1055500	1061500	So when we started Orange Lounge Radio, it was about strictly pretty much music-based video games and what was going on at the scene.
1061500	1064500	Tournaments, you know, all that kind of stuff.
1064500	1074500	So anyhow, tonight we're actually going to sort of look back at that and try to decide, with our scientific Listless process,
1074500	1078500	the best Bamani song of the past ten years.
1078500	1081500	That could be DDR, 2DX, anything is fair game.
1081500	1082500	So here's how it works.
1082500	1092500	All five of us here in studio tonight, that would be myself, DarkSoccer, Loki, Drew, and Miklotov, have all picked their top three, which will compile into a list of fifteen.
1092500	1099500	Then each one of us will go around and take one song off the list, and that will leave us with a list of ten.
1099500	1107500	Once we have that list of ten, you in the chatroom get to vote on your number one and your number two picks, and we will come up with a definitive list.
1107500	1115500	And I'm sure, since we have a lot of people that still listen to this show after all this time, who also love Bamani, we're probably going to piss you off with the stuff we left out.
1115500	1123500	But keep in mind, we only had room for three songs on each of our lists over the past ten years, and we can pick whatever the hell we want.
1123500	1129500	So unfortunately, I need to kill Crystal Waters here, because tonight I'm going to try to play clips from the songs.
1129500	1136500	For those of you that do not know the Bamani game so well, at least you can feel like you know what we're talking about, so we can play some clips of the songs for you guys.
1136500	1141500	So, sorry Crystal Waters, you're out tonight. But meantime, we're going to go around and start the list.
1141500	1145500	So I'll start with Miklotov. He can go first, since he decided to sleep through part A.
1145500	1149500	And what is your number three pick tonight, Miklotov?
1149500	1152500	Well, assuming my list didn't get changed when I had it to.
1152500	1154500	No, everything's fine with the list.
1154500	1157500	Alright, it is Turning the Motor Over.
1157500	1170500	That's my favorite. Yeah, it's freaking awesome. I don't know how to describe it. The singer guy, Jeff Pugh, is just like being green with his voice.
1170500	1179500	And it's a great song. It just got revived in a home version of 2DX Gold, because it's that awesome.
1179500	1185500	This one's actually really fun to play, and it's quite cool.
1185500	1192500	Alright, Shane's number three is Turning the Motor Over. Let's go over to Drew. What is your number three pick tonight?
1192500	1195500	My number three pick is Bitmania.
1195500	1202500	Bitmania. And this was from 2DX 8th Style, if I've done my research right.
1205500	1208500	What is it about this song that makes you want to put it on the list?
1208500	1218500	It's old-school, and it's got a very clear vocal part to it. It makes it really good to play, especially when you're playing 8th Style over in Scandia for the first time.
1218500	1221500	And this is the first time I've played on an arcade machine.
1221500	1226500	Alright, there's Drew's number three pick, Bitmania. We'll start with Loki. What's your number three pick?
1226500	1231500	My number three pick is Rain of Sorrow, and it's from Max 2.
1231500	1240500	And it was fun. It was like, I don't know, I just like the steps in it. And it just had really fun steps, and it was a catchy song.
1240500	1245500	Alright, Rain of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick. Let's listen to it for a little bit.
1245500	1261500	Alright, Rain of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick. You wanna go next, Jamie, or you want me to go?
1261500	1262500	I can go.
1262500	1263500	Alright, what do you want?
1263500	1266500	Brilliant To You OG, from DDR 2nd Mix.
1266500	1267500	Is your number three pick?
1267500	1268500	Oh, sorry, my number three?
1268500	1269500	Yeah.
1269500	1270500	Yeah, that's my number three.
1270500	1283500	Alright, Brilliant To You OG Mix.
1283500	1284500	And why this song?
1284500	1291500	It used to be my very favorite, but I have actually changed my mind on my official number one because of the fun factor.
1291500	1301500	So, this one, though, was like the song I played every freaking time I played a 2-second mix, because that was my first one that I actually owned.
1301500	1304500	Although the first one I played was a 1.5.
1304500	1305500	Alright.
1305500	1306500	It's old school.
1306500	1311500	My number three pick, I love this song. It's from B-Mania 2DX.
1311500	1315500	Actually, I wanna say it showed up early in fifth style, but it actually was a full song in sixth style.
1315500	1324500	Love Is Dreaminess.
1324500	1325500	And I love the video.
1325500	1327500	The video is so freaking adorable.
1327500	1330500	That almost makes the song a little guy with little arms.
1330500	1333500	Look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.
1333500	1334500	Alright, so Love Is Dreaminess.
1334500	1342500	So, so far on the list, turning the motor over, B-Mania, Reign Of Sorrow, Brilliant To You OG Mix, and Love Is Dreaminess.
1342500	1344500	Shane, what did you pick for number two?
1344500	1346500	I picked, oops, sorry.
1346500	1348500	I picked, what did I pick?
1348500	1357500	Right On Time from Guitar Freak's Drummania, because that was like the first Drummania song I ever played.
1357500	1359500	And it was like so freaking good.
1359500	1361500	Yeah, just the constant having it.
1361500	1363500	It's so good.
1363500	1369500	I didn't even do the chorus. I hate it.
1369500	1371500	Better?
1371500	1378500	I think what I was telling Shane is that I called the song The Armbreaker when I got good enough at Drummania to play this one in the intermediate.
1378500	1382500	It was, yeah.
1382500	1389500	It was all the drumming, it was all on the left side, and then you had to hit your cymbal really on the little splash part, so.
1389500	1393500	Alright. Andrew, your number two pick.
1393500	1398500	My number two pick is Caution.
1398500	1402500	Now why this one? This is like from old school.
1402500	1410500	Well, it ought to be obvious that I used to follow DDR freestyle, and nothing reminds me of DDR freestyle, like AP style.
1410500	1414500	And you have the classic Caution Drop.
1414500	1419500	That's used to love seeing videos take over.
1419500	1425500	Can you describe what a Caution Drop is for those that weren't listening to our show when we were doing DDR stuff?
1425500	1430500	Alright. Caution Drop is one of the classic DDR freestyle moves.
1430500	1438500	Basically, the freestyler hops onto up and right, and then drops back onto their hands onto down and left.
1438500	1442500	So they just kind of slam back down onto the pad.
1442500	1447500	It's cool when it's done right, but it can hurt you a lot if you do it wrong.
1447500	1451500	Alright. Caution, also known as, I can probably not pronounce this.
1451500	1458500	Wongo, Gongo? Or Don't Bother Me, because that's what it was called in Pump It Up, because it's a better game.
1458500	1461500	Alright, there you have it.
1461500	1467500	Alright. So, Loki, what was your, I'm getting all mixed up here, trying to juggle like five different screens here.
1467500	1469500	Loki, what was your number two pick?
1469500	1474500	My number two pick was Era, the nostril mix, or whatever it is.
1474500	1476500	The nostril mix.
1476500	1480500	No, it wasn't nostril.
1480500	1483500	Because it was just a cool song. And it's packed.
1483500	1485500	And our live listeners heard this during the break tonight.
1485500	1487500	Yes.
1487500	1489500	I don't know.
1489500	1492500	Alright, there you have it. Era, the nostril mix. Remember, you guys and Jack...
1492500	1498500	Actually, I think it was one of the first songs that had the speed change in DDR fourth mix, I want to say.
1498500	1500500	Yeah.
1500500	1506500	Well, unless you consider, was it...
1506500	1507500	Absolute.
1507500	1511500	No, that was fifth mix. I was thinking...
1511500	1512500	.59
1512500	1519500	No,.59 was also fourth. There is that Love... whatever, I'll remember it. From third mix.
1519500	1521500	Love This Feelin'?
1521500	1523500	Yes, Love This Feelin'. That had a speed change.
1523500	1524500	Thanks, GS68.
1524500	1526500	I have a funny story about this song.
1526500	1528500	Go ahead.
1528500	1537500	It's... I scared Dan one time. I don't know if he remembers this, but the first time I ever beat that song in Seven Key, I screamed.
1537500	1541500	Because I had been trying for like an hour, doing nothing but playing that song.
1541500	1545500	And he's like, what's wrong? I beat Era O.
1545500	1548500	And he went back to doing what he was doing.
1548500	1554500	So, that's it.
1554500	1555500	Alright.
1555500	1558500	Sorry, I was turning on the lights in the studio.
1558500	1561500	I can't leave this computer chair for like two seconds.
1561500	1564500	Alright, Dark Sakura, what would your number two pick be?
1564500	1569500	My number two pick is Dancer from Beatmania 8th Style.
1569500	1575500	Beatmania 2DX 8th Style.
1575500	1578500	That's not the Beatmania version.
1578500	1590500	Yeah, it is. This is it. This is the middle of it.
1590500	1593500	There's an album version of it.
1593500	1594500	Oh, gotcha.
1594500	1602500	But no, I like that song because you just have people dancing in the background and doing the stupid arm-waving pose and holding up a doll.
1602500	1608500	The video was the greatest 2DX video they ever made. Period. I don't think they made a better video than Dancer.
1608500	1610500	Alright.
1610500	1614500	So Dancer is Jamie's number two pick. Okay, my number two pick. I gotta preface this.
1614500	1617500	You're gonna hate my number two pick. And I don't care. Screw you.
1617500	1620500	Because honestly, it's my list of top three.
1620500	1623500	And honestly, I can say this was all honesty.
1623500	1631500	If it were not for this song, or more specifically, this band, I would not have been all gaga over Japanese DDR as I was.
1631500	1636500	This band was an enabler to me for DDR.
1636500	1637500	Uh oh.
1637500	1658500	And that's why my number two pick is Erotic with Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.
1658500	1660500	Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick, my number two pick.
1660500	1664500	Alright, yes, with the crappy rapping and everything. You just gotta love it. It's so bad.
1664500	1669500	Alright, um, now we get to the number one picks, right? We have a list of ten.
1669500	1671500	So let's add the number ones.
1671500	1676500	Shane, Mikletov, what is your number one favorite Bimani song of all time?
1676500	1683500	Um, my number one favorite Bimani song of all time would be Boom Boom Dollar from DDR.
1683500	1687500	Because it is the first DDR song I ever heard.
1687500	1693500	And the lyrics cracked me up because I didn't know what was going on because I just heard it on like an internet radio thing I used to listen to.
1693500	1697500	And so I thought the premise of DDR was you had to hit the arrows for more time.
1697500	1701500	Because it said, pushing all the buttons more times.
1701500	1704500	And now I understand it's kind of true because if you don't hit the arrows, you die.
1704500	1706500	But it's not the way I thought.
1706500	1708500	And I love this song so much.
1708500	1711500	Nice. There you have it. Boom Boom Dollar.
1711500	1714500	Mikletov's number one favorite Bimani song of all time.
1714500	1719500	Drew, what is your number one most favoritest Bimani song of all time?
1719500	1724500	It was so hard to pick and I know I'm going to piss off the other old school people.
1724500	1728500	But I have to say, my number one is Zephyr.
1731500	1734500	Everything about this song is great.
1734500	1735500	It's epic.
1735500	1741500	The video, the vocals, the strings, the vocals.
1741500	1744500	It's a hell of a song.
1744500	1748500	This song is pretty fucking epic, I will say that.
1748500	1750500	It just screams epic.
1750500	1754500	This is the song that you imagine Itagaki burning things to.
1756500	1761500	Alright, Loki, your number one favorite Bimani song of all time.
1761500	1764500	This is probably one of the first songs I ever played.
1764500	1770500	And I have to say, out of all the songs I've played in DDR, I'd say I've probably played this song the most.
1770500	1778500	And it's been in, I would say, probably the most DDR mixes possible.
1778500	1780500	Dynamite Rave.
1792500	1795500	You know, Dynamite Rave is one of those songs that age well.
1795500	1798500	Because I remember in the beginning of this show, we used to make fun of this song all the freaking time.
1798500	1801500	Because we were just so annoyed by it, how it showed up everywhere.
1801500	1805500	But looking back like six years now, this song was actually pretty fun.
1805500	1808500	Drop E and hump the coin return.
1808500	1811500	I remember somebody doing a routine to this.
1811500	1813500	He was in this room.
1813500	1815500	Yes, remember the Scat tournament.
1815500	1817500	Sacramento's cosplaying tournament.
1817500	1819500	Yes, I forgot everything else.
1821500	1824500	It wasn't me that thought of the acronym, okay?
1824500	1825500	Somebody don't talk anymore.
1825500	1828500	The Scat is...
1828500	1830500	Not what you're thinking of.
1830500	1832500	Alright.
1832500	1838500	Dark Sakura, your number one favorite Bamani song of all freaking time.
1838500	1844500	I would have to say that I'm gonna go with Heaven is a 57 metallic gray just because it's so fun.
1851500	1853500	Isn't that fun?
1853500	1857500	Although I think it was funny that the original name was just me.
1857500	1859500	What, Heaven is a 57 Chevrolet?
1859500	1860500	Yeah.
1860500	1862500	I think they didn't want that.
1862500	1864500	They couldn't get licensing on it.
1864500	1867500	The steps on EDR are really fun.
1867500	1869500	I like it in Dance Maniacs.
1869500	1874500	The reason I like it in Dance Maniacs is because you do the whole knee squirrel and everything.
1874500	1881500	It has you doing stuff that requires lower body and upper body, so it actually looks a bit more like you're dancing with it.
1881500	1885500	And it's very swingy. I think it's fun.
1885500	1891500	And Dance Maniacs is kind of the forgotten Bamani game, sadly, too.
1891500	1895500	Table Waxing Revolution.
1895500	1897500	That and Keyboard Mania are off in a corner crying.
1897500	1900500	It's all about Dance Maniacs, second.
1900500	1902500	Dampen.
1902500	1905500	In Marathon Mode, center.
1905500	1908500	That's happy right there.
1908500	1912500	All right. That just leaves me one more song for the list.
1912500	1914500	And no one cares, so bye.
1914500	1915500	I'm kidding.
1915500	1916500	What?
1916500	1917500	Heart.
1917500	1918500	Okay.
1918500	1923500	And this song, my number one favorite, is also kind of an enabler of sorts.
1923500	1929500	Because honestly, I found a whole lot of new music because of the game this was in.
1929500	1932500	And because of this mix and everything.
1932500	1938500	Yeah, this song is just my most favorite Bamani song ever, and it's Skulk by Echo Image.
1952500	1955500	There it is. Skulk.
1955500	1959500	All right, so that leaves the list right now as this.
1959500	1963500	And while I read the list, I'm curious, Chat Room, what did we forget?
1963500	1965500	We're going to get a whole lot of that.
1965500	1967500	You know what I was almost going to put in it.
1967500	1970500	What did we forget? Yeah, what songs almost made it for you guys?
1970500	1978500	Stuff that almost made it in for me was Gatchamanote from Poppin' Music and Lupin the Third.
1978500	1988500	And the one that I was really fighting over, though, was Twinbee and the Gradius Full Speed.
1988500	1990500	It's hard to have just three, isn't it?
1990500	1995500	It is, but I had to really think of the ones that I thought were a bit more pivotal to me, so.
1995500	1999500	Right. For me, I would say songs that were so close yet so far for me.
1999500	2005500	Probably, and now I'm driving light, V35, Flotation, although nobody likes that song.
2005500	2006500	Boo!
2006500	2008500	Shut Up, I Hate You, Thunder from 2DX.
2008500	2010500	Flotation was good, shut up.
2010500	2014500	They're like all 2DX songs after those 2DDR songs I have.
2014500	2016500	Miklotov, what was close for you?
2016500	2022500	Yeah, I had Rock Beat and Wanda down for my four and five just in case my other three got taken.
2022500	2029500	Yeah, but I also just realized I really should have put such a feeling, or not such a feeling.
2029500	2030500	What was it called?
2030500	2040500	No, no, it's one from DDR Hottest Party because it really brought back the feeling of DDR for me just the way it sounds.
2040500	2043500	It's by Yuichi, so it's pretty good.
2043500	2048500	I was just going to say I didn't put Love in there, which was like my song on repeat for a long time.
2048500	2053500	We're getting lots of people in chat saying how could we not have Captain Jack on the list.
2053500	2055500	Not a one of us named Captain Jack.
2055500	2057500	Shane says it's because he's dead.
2057500	2059500	It's not that, I don't know, you know what?
2059500	2061500	I have a CD.
2061500	2064500	The songs were catchy, they just weren't my favorite.
2064500	2066500	All Captain Jack says is nice too.
2066500	2069500	I grew Charlie Nash says Moonlight Shadow, I love that song.
2069500	2070500	That's a good one.
2070500	2075500	It's an ordinary, or not ordinary world, that's okay, Ghost and Drifting Away for me.
2075500	2077500	Loki?
2077500	2083500	I liked, was it Fantasy from Max 2?
2083500	2087500	No, no, not the Eurobeat one, the other Fantasy.
2087500	2089500	The one that was in 2DX 4 style, right?
2089500	2093500	No, no, not that one, the one that was only in Max 2.
2093500	2094500	Too many songs named Fantasy.
2094500	2096500	Yeah, it was cool.
2096500	2104500	And also, I would say probably, cause we gotta, can't forget about guitar freaks, Fire.
2104500	2106500	Cause that was awesome.
2106500	2109500	And End of the Century.
2109500	2111500	Frisbee says DXY.
2111500	2113500	Holic, we're getting yelled at for forgetting.
2113500	2115500	We do have a taco song in there.
2115500	2119500	And what was it, you know, we probably like, was it Baquah?
2119500	2124500	But I, what was the third Korean song that I used to play all the time?
2124500	2127500	I love Face.
2127500	2129500	Drew, quickly?
2129500	2132500	Oh man, there were so many that I'd forgotten at the last minute.
2132500	2134500	I'm like, I wanna change my mind on the number one.
2134500	2138500	My backups were Legend of Max, Murmur Twins.
2138500	2139500	Murmur Twins is good.
2139500	2141500	Jack and Mark Get Busy.
2141500	2146500	And what was going to be my number one at the last minute, I'm like, oh crap, he's gonna do it anyway.
2146500	2148500	LED Something Wonderful.
2148500	2153500	I have to offer the suggestions that Sauce gave me.
2153500	2159500	It was Boom Boom Dollar and El Ritmo Tropical, even though we put Boom Boom Dollar in there.
2159500	2165500	Bobby Black Wolf, our buddy before us here on Sunday Nights on All Games says, what, No Linus?
2165500	2166500	I like that song.
2166500	2167500	It sounds pretty cool.
2167500	2168500	It's hard.
2168500	2169500	Alright.
2169500	2170500	And Cheer Train.
2170500	2171500	No, no, no, no, no.
2171500	2176500	What was the one that had the stick figures doing the hadoken with the heart in the video?
2176500	2177500	I don't remember.
2177500	2180500	I love that song and I can't even remember the name of it.
2180500	2184500	There's a really difficult task ahead of us now and that is we have to reduce this list of 15 to 10.
2184500	2186500	This is going to be painful.
2186500	2187500	No one take it personally.
2187500	2188500	Alright.
2188500	2189500	It's just a game.
2189500	2190500	Alright.
2190500	2192500	Here we go.
2192500	2194500	Here's the list of stands so far.
2194500	2208500	Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Rain of Sorrow, Brilliant To You, OG Mix, Love Is Dreamyness, Right On Time, Caution, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Boom Boom Dollar, Zephyr, Dynamite Rave, Heaven Is A 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.
2208500	2213500	Miklotov, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2213500	2214500	What's the list again?
2214500	2216500	You come over here and look.
2216500	2218500	I'm not reading it again for our poor radio listeners.
2218500	2219500	I totally had it for a second.
2219500	2222500	You were too damn lazy to take a little effort and think about it.
2222500	2226500	Oh, I'm taking Caution off there because it was better in Pump.
2226500	2227500	Oh, Caution.
2227500	2230500	Same thing in Pump, just a little longer.
2230500	2232500	Caution has been stricken from the list.
2232500	2234500	Drew, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2234500	2238500	Ah.
2238500	2240500	Boom Boom Dollar is off the list.
2240500	2241500	Oh, snap.
2241500	2242500	Oh, snap.
2242500	2243500	But it's on.
2243500	2246500	It is on.
2246500	2249500	Boom Boom Dollar has been stricken from the list.
2249500	2251500	I think that he just did that so that Shane would go pout.
2251500	2254500	As Miklotov runs off to pout.
2254500	2259500	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2259500	2264500	You know, I just don't like Zephyr.
2264500	2266500	Oh, you wound me again.
2266500	2271500	Zephyr is off the list.
2271500	2272500	Now we're down to 12.
2272500	2276500	Dark Sakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2276500	2281500	I am going to go with...
2281500	2283500	Take his other song out.
2283500	2284500	He's only got one left.
2284500	2285500	Come on.
2285500	2287500	Yeah, but it's Bitmania, isn't it?
2287500	2288500	No, Bitmania stays in.
2288500	2290500	Yeah, Bitmania has to stay.
2290500	2293500	I'm sorry.
2293500	2297500	Shane is trying to conspire to get Drew's final song off the list.
2297500	2303500	I am...
2303500	2305500	Will you buy me a chocolate?
2305500	2306500	No.
2306500	2307500	No.
2307500	2308500	I'm not taking bribes.
2308500	2311500	I'm going to say Reign of Sorrow.
2311500	2314500	Reign of Sorrow has been stricken from the list.
2314500	2318500	All right, gosh, that was the one I was going to take.
2318500	2321500	So we have Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant TU OG Mix,
2321500	2326500	Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick,
2326500	2329500	Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.
2329500	2335500	I can't believe Erotic survived that round.
2335500	2337500	Oh, God, this is hard.
2337500	2338500	I actually like all these songs.
2338500	2348500	I really like all these songs.
2348500	2353500	I don't know.
2353500	2354500	I'm going to...
2354500	2355500	Oh, God, I hate to do this.
2355500	2356500	I'm going to take out Dynamite Rave.
2356500	2358500	Sorry, Loki.
2358500	2360500	It just was staring me as sore thumb like,
2360500	2364500	you don't really like this song, Rob.
2364500	2365500	All right.
2365500	2367500	So we are left with 10, a list of 10.
2367500	2369500	Here it is.
2369500	2373500	Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant TU OG Mix,
2373500	2377500	Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Nostal Mix, Dancer,
2377500	2384500	Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.
2384500	2386500	All right.
2386500	2389500	So there it is in the chat room.
2389500	2391500	And if you would send me a private message in chat,
2391500	2392500	those of you that are listening live tonight,
2392500	2395500	with your number one and your number two picks,
2395500	2397500	make sure it's clearly listed,
2397500	2399500	or I will assume the first one is your number one pick,
2399500	2403500	and we will reveal the results of the definitive top three
2403500	2405500	Bimani songs ever.
2405500	2408500	And help me try to remember what the hell that song was to that video.
2408500	2410500	While you're at it.
2410500	2412500	With the, oh, with the stick figures.
2412500	2414500	It had the stick figure doing the heart hadoken.
2414500	2415500	I don't remember.
2415500	2416500	I love that song and I couldn't remember it.
2416500	2418500	I'm sorry.
2418500	2419500	All right.
2419500	2421500	Well, we'll get back to gaming news in the meantime.
2421500	2422500	And Dark Sakura's going to start us off.
2422500	2423500	Oh, do I gotta?
2423500	2424500	You gotta.
2424500	2425500	This is bugging me now.
2425500	2426500	Rob.
2426500	2427500	What?
2427500	2428500	Nom.
2428500	2429500	Nom, nom, nom, nom.
2429500	2430500	Nom, nom, nom, nom.
2430500	2431500	You're hungry or what?
2431500	2433500	No, it has to do with Nintendo.
2433500	2437500	Nintendo has filed a trademark in Japan that's called Nom.
2437500	2439500	Nom, nom, nom.
2439500	2440500	Nintendo online magazine.
2440500	2442500	N-O-M.
2442500	2450500	And, um, it is, uh, I really,
2450500	2452500	I guess I don't know what to say about, you know,
2452500	2455500	anything other than a Nintendo online magazine.
2455500	2460500	Um, maybe it's going to be like, well, you know,
2460500	2464500	Nintendo already publishes a regular magazine in Japan and we haven't,
2464500	2467500	I think Nintendo, isn't Nintendo Power still in publication?
2467500	2468500	Yeah.
2468500	2471500	So maybe this is just going to be condensed versions of them online.
2471500	2474500	You know, like, I guess,
2474500	2478500	doesn't EGM have their online site now and all these other places do.
2478500	2484500	So I miss Game Pro because I like pro tips.
2484500	2487500	I miss Game Pro.
2487500	2490500	I miss Game Pro TV.
2490500	2495500	Well, uh, people were saddened earlier this week when, uh,
2495500	2500500	there was a brand new Wii update to the Wii menu update 3.3,
2500500	2504500	which nullified the Twilight Princess hack and, uh,
2504500	2509500	allowed you also to, um, do something with your Miis and the Mii parade and that kind of thing.
2509500	2517500	Well, a few days later, they had already, um, thwarted the said hack.
2517500	2521500	And in fact, today they already released a brand new Twilight hack that bypasses their fix.
2521500	2523500	Go Nintendo!
2523500	2527500	You might want to call Sony and let them know how that turned out for them too.
2527500	2529500	What did the hack do?
2529500	2532500	What the hack did was it was a buffer overflow.
2532500	2537500	Um, it altered the name of Apuna and, um,
2537500	2541500	allowed basically hackers to change the name.
2541500	2545500	And so the game was looking for a certain name and it over,
2545500	2550500	it was too large for what it was supposed to be and it caused it to crash.
2550500	2552500	And then they ran their own code on top of that.
2552500	2557500	So it didn't affect people that already had the homebrew channel installed in their system,
2557500	2559500	but now it doesn't even matter anymore.
2559500	2563500	So, if you're still interested in homebrew or other things,
2563500	2566500	um, the brand new Twilight hack has been released.
2566500	2568500	So, enjoy.
2568500	2571500	Hmm.
2571500	2576500	Do you think, uh, this is going to become an ongoing battle like Sony versus their homebrew people?
2576500	2578500	Yes, I do.
2578500	2580500	All right. Yes, I do.
2580500	2582500	All right.
2582500	2586500	Um, well, you know, last week I got a little angsty over the whole lack of storage space on the Wii.
2586500	2590500	Well, somebody appears to be doing something about it, kinda, sorta.
2590500	2592500	And it has to do with Guitar Hero World Tour.
2592500	2600500	Um, what's pretty cool about this is that you can actually save songs to a rock archive on an SD card.
2600500	2605500	You can play songs off the card without even copying them over first.
2605500	2610500	Meaning that download content will be available to save on an SD card.
2610500	2616500	Thank you, somebody, for figuring this out. And, uh, it just proves it's possible.
2616500	2620500	And Nintendo just needs to patch their dang system already to make this happen.
2620500	2623500	I'm surprised Rock Band didn't do it first.
2623500	2630500	But with, you know, Rock Band coming out for Wii and all the downloadable content that could be there, but isn't.
2630500	2632500	Yeah.
2632500	2634500	All right. Well, that'll be kinda cool.
2634500	2638500	And I'm happy to see that, uh, the Wii will get to participate in that download content.
2638500	2641500	So I'm kinda curious how they're gonna incorporate that into the store-thor.
2641500	2645500	The store-thor? The store, though. That should be, um, interesting.
2645500	2647500	Kinda curious to see how that's gonna work.
2647500	2650500	But I guess we'll find out when the game gets a little closer to being out.
2650500	2653500	Meanwhile, we wanna hear what you have to say.
2653500	2658500	Mailbagorangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.
2658500	2662500	And every week Dark Soccer will open up the mailbag, jump on in, and pull out her favorite emails to read to you.
2662500	2664500	And she's gonna do that right now.
2664500	2671500	I'm still mad that no one's found me the name of that song.
2671500	2673500	Sorry.
2673500	2675500	First email!
2675500	2677500	Comes from Spazzinator.
2677500	2682500	Hi, everyone! It's called Quick Question, but the letter really isn't anything but, so I'm still gonna read it.
2682500	2689500	Hi, everyone. I'm hoping to, uh, get your input on an ongoing debate that I'm having with someone.
2689500	2694500	The debate is whether or not any online interaction people...
2694500	2699500	Okay, first of all, almost this person's E's in the first paragraphs are R's, so it's really bizarre.
2699500	2711500	If any online interactions people have had with each other, whether it be MMOs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI or any other online game, for that matter, constitute socializing.
2711500	2713500	Yes.
2713500	2718500	My line of thought is that these online interactions is indeed socializing.
2718500	2728500	I categorize socializing as the interaction between two or more people for non-business AKA fun purposes, regardless of the medium involved, whether it be in-person, online, or whatever.
2728500	2734500	As long as person A interacts with person B and vice versa, and it's non-business related, it's socializing.
2734500	2741500	The only limiting factor in online socializing is that you cannot as of yet beat the living snot out of some other people, nor can you have sex with them.
2741500	2743500	We're working on that, I'm sure.
2743500	2744500	They fake it.
2744500	2746500	On both counts.
2746500	2749500	Those two things, you have to have that in person.
2749500	2752500	Is this to say that one is better than the other? I don't think so.
2752500	2756500	In some cases, in-person socializing is not feasible due to distance and whatnot.
2756500	2768500	How many people are really going to travel hundreds if not thousands of miles to socialize and play games with another person when online will suffice, especially with these high-as-hell gas prices?
2768500	2771500	What is your take on this issue?
2771500	2775500	I actually do agree that it is socializing.
2775500	2778500	A community is a community.
2778500	2791500	Back in the days when I played a fantasy star online blue burst, we had our groups, we were hanging out and chatting about crap while we busted the crap out of things.
2791500	2797500	I hang out with people on Ragnarok, I hang out with a lot of people online.
2797500	2801500	It's really just another medium of communication.
2801500	2813500	WoW for me is especially like that because we go around and we're doing our thing in Warcraft, but I'm having more fun just chatting on Ventrilo and all the crazy antics that happen on there, talking to people.
2813500	2814500	It's like a party chat.
2814500	2818500	I'm going to have to make the distinction here.
2818500	2832500	Talking to other people on a global game scale, like say on your server in WoW or in Final Fantasy, that's not socializing. You're just there.
2832500	2846500	When you get down to the guild level or the IRC channel level, stuff like that, the guild, the party, the channel, whatever it is, that would probably be a social community albeit not a very personal one at first.
2846500	2853500	But that would be how you define community, as in your smaller guilds, not your entire server.
2853500	2859500	But other than that, I think it's a perfectly viable form of socializing.
2859500	2862500	I have to quote something that Sas just told me.
2862500	2868500	Some people spend hours talking on the phone, other people spend hours talking in IM. Same difference.
2868500	2869500	True.
2869500	2881500	Especially with a lot of long-distance friendships that technology has allowed us to build. Back in the day, you'd have a pen pal in a faraway place, and that was pretty much it.
2881500	2887500	But thanks to the internet, you can talk to somebody in a whole other country as easily.
2887500	2891500	I mean, look at our show. We have people calling us from other countries. It doesn't cost them anything, thanks to Skype.
2891500	2898500	All my family, a lot of my friends are all over the country, and this is how I keep in touch with them.
2898500	2908500	And I think that, in fact, hold on, somebody else, in case you said, okay, fine. Sorry for misquoting you. She said diff, not difference, whatever.
2908500	2912500	I'm going to look up something, though, so somebody else add to that.
2912500	2921500	Well, I was just going to say real quick that we've joked plenty of times, you know, or at least I've said this, is that World of Warcraft is just a chat room with a fireball spell.
2921500	2922500	You know?
2922500	2923500	A very bad chat room.
2923500	2925500	It's fun, no, it's a great game.
2925500	2930500	Again, on the guild level, it's a very good chat room. In Baron's Chat, it's a very bad chat room.
2930500	2933500	You just turn off Baron's Chat. That's what I do.
2933500	2935500	Trade Chat.
2935500	2936500	I shouldn't have to.
2936500	2938500	Trade Chat is the new Baron's Chat, by the way.
2938500	2939500	I shouldn't have to.
2939500	2961500	Going to dictionary.com, which I love, especially for my stupid nutrition class with my really anal teacher. Socialize is defined as taking part in social activities, interacting with others, or to train for a social environment, to prepare for social life, or to conform to, oh, that's socialism, sorry.
2961500	2966500	But another one listed on here is to associate or mingle sociably with others.
2966500	2973500	It does not say anywhere in any of these dozens of definitions to physically interact.
2973500	2977500	That's called punching or boinking or slapping.
2977500	2978500	Nice.
2978500	2980500	Or staring at them.
2980500	2981500	Bonk.
2981500	2988500	So by the dictionary, there is no requirement to be in person to socialize.
2988500	2992500	I believe NintendoManiac64 rejects your analysis.
2992500	2998500	He says BaDictionary.com. It's all about the dictionary now. I'm just kidding.
2998500	3000500	WTF ever.
3000500	3002500	Yeah, Urban Dictionary is the best.
3002500	3004500	That's a big freaking whatever.
3004500	3007500	I name all my WoW characters off of Urban Dictionary.
3007500	3008500	You do?
3008500	3009500	Yes.
3009500	3010500	Like what?
3010500	3012500	Well, my main character is called Sassy Pants.
3012500	3013500	You know what I still remember?
3013500	3014500	What?
3014500	3015500	Lil Kim.
3015500	3016500	Yeah.
3016500	3017500	Yeah, Lil Kim was my Final Fantasy XI character.
3017500	3018500	Final Fantasy XI.
3018500	3024500	No, my newest one I just rolled the other night is Drama Llama.
3024500	3027500	A girl who spits out her drama everywhere like a llama.
3027500	3028500	I hate people like that.
3028500	3030500	So to conclude this letter.
3030500	3036500	Also, if I may, I would like to give a quick shout out to some people that I didn't get a chance to when I called in last week.
3036500	3043500	Hello to everyone in the Limit Break Radio link shell on the Odin server on Final Fantasy XI.
3043500	3046500	I played on that server for five seconds.
3046500	3051500	And everyone in the Happy Haven link shell on the Alexander server on Final Fantasy XI.
3051500	3054500	Especially Digby Reloaded, Jaden, Brina, and Reiku.
3054500	3056500	Thanks in advance.
3056500	3058500	Oh, memories of Final Fantasy XI.
3058500	3063500	You know, it's too bad Minkolatov ran off to pout because this would be the part where I might say he's trying to get me to play again.
3063500	3064500	And I told him no.
3064500	3065500	I just can't.
3065500	3067500	Thinking of playing again makes me want to vomit.
3067500	3068500	I can't.
3068500	3069500	Call of Taku compels you.
3069500	3071500	I can't.
3071500	3073500	No disrespect to those still playing.
3073500	3074500	I just, I can't.
3074500	3075500	I'm already playing a good game.
3075500	3078500	It's like a bad breakup.
3078500	3082500	To go on with the next email, and this is coming from Robert M.
3082500	3085500	Glad to see you're all doing well.
3085500	3087500	Shifting without a clutch.
3087500	3094500	From what I've heard from the press releases for the upcoming Guitar Hero World Tour, AKA GH4.
3094500	3098500	It will indeed allow you to store, purchase, and download those songs onto your SD cards.
3098500	3100500	Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.
3100500	3103500	Here's to hoping more developers are able to do that.
3103500	3107500	I've also been working quite a bit on Space Invaders Extreme.
3107500	3110500	Hard to say which invaders are more annoying in multiplayer.
3110500	3112500	The mirror shields reflect types officially.
3112500	3114500	Or the ISB's assault types.
3114500	3120500	And it says this email was brought to you by Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix Home of the Never Ending Story.
3120500	3121500	Nice.
3121500	3122500	That's the best.
3122500	3126500	By the way, when I was talking about Space Invaders Extreme in part A,
3126500	3129500	I have yet to play multiplayer because I have no friends with the game.
3129500	3132500	Except for Loki, but he'll probably never play it with me.
3132500	3133500	Poor Rob.
3133500	3134500	Poor me.
3134500	3139500	Well, this email, this next one comes from someone familiar and near and dear to all of us
3139500	3142500	who stayed with me at Fauna Mae last year.
3142500	3143500	Who?
3143500	3144500	It's from Kamira.
3144500	3146500	Ah, yes.
3146500	3149500	Hey guys, unfortunately I haven't been able to listen to the episodes lately.
3149500	3151500	Something wrong with podcasts.
3151500	3155500	Anyway, I just wanted to congratulate you all on six years of pure, unadulterated awesome.
3155500	3157500	Here's to six more years.
3157500	3159500	Take care and I think of you every Sunday.
3159500	3160500	Yay, thank you.
3160500	3161500	Thank you.
3161500	3162500	We miss you.
3162500	3163500	We miss you.
3163500	3164500	Come back and visit soon.
3164500	3168500	And one from Hippolytus.
3168500	3169500	Some thoughts.
3169500	3172500	First, Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, yes, you were all geek.
3172500	3176500	She spent ten minutes talking about D&D and then complained that somebody rightly calls you a geek as if.
3176500	3180500	No, what we complained about wasn't using geek as a derogatory.
3180500	3187500	So, which actually we very much specified several times over in the last episode.
3187500	3191500	So, as if.
3191500	3195500	I realize we left ourselves wide open for a crack like that.
3195500	3200500	But really what we were saying was not that we had a problem with the fact that he called us a geek,
3200500	3208500	but just the fact that he was being so derogatory about it when it is a flaw of the Nintendo Wii.
3208500	3210500	So, STFU, sit down.
3210500	3212500	Not you, the guy at Nintendo.
3212500	3215500	Second, updates on Saturday, really?
3215500	3216500	Okay.
3216500	3218500	Third, Patti LuPone.
3218500	3224500	Dude, it's all about Bernadette Peters if you don't have Ethel Merman.
3224500	3227500	I think it's criticizing my musical choices.
3227500	3230500	I just pulled one up in iTunes, okay?
3230500	3231500	Bernadette Peters was awesome.
3231500	3234500	She used to be on the Muppet Show all the time.
3234500	3235500	I'm sorry.
3235500	3238500	I actually really, really dig Bernadette Peters.
3238500	3239500	Okay.
3239500	3243500	Fourth, import can't decide what to eat now.
3243500	3244500	Thank you.
3244500	3245500	Mini review.
3245500	3247500	Cookbook for the DS published by Nintendo.
3247500	3253500	You can choose a recipe based on ingredients, source country, difficulty, cooking method, calories, or cooking time.
3253500	3258500	It will create a shopping list for you, and since the DS is so portable, you can take it to the market with you.
3258500	3265500	I saw that coming out, and I actually was very interested in acquiring it for my DS.
3265500	3267500	To continue, awesome features.
3267500	3271500	The recipe will read aloud all the steps to you so you don't have to look at the DS.
3271500	3274500	You can go forward and backward in the recipe with voice controls.
3274500	3276500	Continue, go back, more info.
3276500	3280500	Really, the only thing that's missing is that, remember how they had that DS cookbook came out in Japan
3280500	3284500	that had a little thing that plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot that was a magnet
3284500	3287500	so you could stick it to your fridge while you cook?
3287500	3289500	That's pretty cool.
3289500	3295500	Just to conclude the email, in addition to the wonderful photos and full voiceover,
3295500	3300500	there are also videos, yes a return of full motion video, to demonstrate difficult concepts or techniques.
3300500	3305500	In short, this game probably would be a mascot game for Orange Lounge Foodio.
3305500	3313500	This message is brought to you by Y Kitchen, home of the best-intended DS-inspired food.
3313500	3315500	I'm getting this game.
3315500	3316500	Don't worry, mama will fix it.
3316500	3318500	I'm getting this game.
3318500	3319500	No, no, no, no.
3319500	3321500	Get it, it's already been gotten.
3321500	3326500	But no, I've been major food whore lately, as in cooking everything.
3326500	3328500	I made the best beef stew, okay?
3328500	3331500	No, someone on this show, a fan of food?
3331500	3334500	But I mean, I've been cooking a whole lot lately.
3334500	3336500	And my beef stew is stupendous.
3336500	3340500	This is true, she was talking to me about her beef stew for like five minutes before the show started.
3340500	3341500	Doesn't sound good.
3341500	3343500	But she's going to make me some, so I'm okay with it.
3343500	3347500	Well I'm going to bring you some, I've got tons of it.
3347500	3351500	Apparently Junami wants to come over to my house and have beef stew.
3351500	3352500	Beefs.
3352500	3354500	More email.
3354500	3355500	Mas email.
3355500	3356500	Do I gotta?
3356500	3357500	Unless there's no more left.
3357500	3358500	There's two more.
3358500	3367500	So I heard you guys mention that this alleged Kenyan should fly the Kenyan flag outside of a Kenyan building in Kenya and throw a gang sign up or something.
3367500	3369500	An OLR gang sign or something.
3369500	3372500	So I thought he might need a little inspiration.
3372500	3376500	And the guy sent us pictures of him doing a weird OLR inspired gang sign.
3376500	3377500	Which was awesome.
3377500	3382500	I know, it's pretty cool, but no, we don't want him to fly the Kenyan, that was Rob wanting to fly the Kenyan flag.
3382500	3386500	I just wanted a picture in front of that Samara cafe so I could see how shitty it is.
3386500	3391500	But will you link those pictures in chat so that everybody can learn the OLR gang signs?
3391500	3393500	I will, and this came from Paradox Vincent.
3393500	3397500	Even though we're spreading Paradox Vincent's mug all over our chat room, I'm sure he won't mind.
3397500	3401500	All pictures you send us become our property, so nyeh.
3401500	3405500	And by our property, by our property we mean everybody's property.
3405500	3406500	That's right.
3406500	3408500	It's on the internet.
3408500	3416500	DarkSocker's currently posting those links in chat. For those of you guys not in chat, well, I guess that's incentive to join us next time. Maybe we'll post those in the forums after the show.
3416500	3418500	We are not Orange Chicken Radio.
3418500	3419500	We're not?
3419500	3422500	Joshy16 says we are Orange Chicken Radio.
3422500	3425500	But I love Orange- I almost had Orange Chicken for dinner last night.
3425500	3426500	Oh, it's Cheesecake Factory.
3426500	3431500	By the way, for those in the studio, and also there's the OLR gang sign right there.
3431500	3433500	Pretty nice, for those in the studio.
3433500	3437500	Last email! Dun dun dun! From Dwayne.
3437500	3449500	Hello, love the show. With the release of Syphon Filter 3 and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror on the Playstation Network, what are the chances that Sony will release a PS3 version of Syphon Filter, the most underrated action game ever?
3449500	3454500	Also having a PS make my home the playhouse for my nieces and nephews.
3454500	3459500	I would love to get a Guitar Hero Rock Band game for them to team up on.
3459500	3467500	But the problem is, well, let's just say we are an urban family, not trying to hear Metallica, Def Leppard, or Aerosmith unless it's with Run DMC.
3467500	3471500	More into Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, and Jay-Z.
3471500	3477500	Heck, I will take some old Prince, Michael Jackson, or Marvin Gaye. What are the chances of getting an R&B band or DJ Hero?
3477500	3480500	Thanks, Dwayne. PS, can I get a Fuck You to gas prices?
3480500	3484500	Well, last I heard, they were working on DJ Hero, so...
3484500	3487500	A matter of time, I guess?
3487500	3489500	Eventually.
3489500	3496500	You can always buy BeatMania 2DX, which did come out on Playstation 2.
3496500	3499500	I would love a home version of Crackin' DJ so bad.
3499500	3504500	I'm sorry, didn't MTV try a game like that and fail horribly?
3504500	3509500	See, personally, I think that they're great because I have Radiohead.
3509500	3514500	I freaking love Radiohead. The only thing it needs is Blur.
3514500	3516500	Hi.
3516500	3519500	Alright. Is that it for e-mail?
3519500	3523500	Yeah, but speaking of Blur, I was watching some band on the Graham Norton show yesterday.
3523500	3526500	That's the most I've ever actually watched any significant amount of the show.
3526500	3533500	And I didn't know who they were, but some guy was playing the keyboard and I was like, this is a bad Blur impersonation.
3533500	3537500	Well, if you want to send us e-mails and get Jamie all nostalgic for her favorite bands,
3537500	3543500	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those e-mails to.
3543500	3550500	Meanwhile, we're one story away from tonight's listless results and the revival of another favorite Orange Lounge radio segment.
3550500	3554500	Listless results on their way right after one more story. Loki?
3554500	3560500	Yes. In case you're really, really, really lonely or just need something to hump, I guess.
3560500	3564500	Sega has created a robotic girlfriend for you.
3564500	3573500	Her name, I guess, is Emma, or Eternal Maiden Actualization, and she is...
3573500	3576500	She looks like an eyebo.
3576500	3578500	Yeah, she looks like an eyebo.
3578500	3580500	She looks like an eyebo.
3580500	3583500	And she stands, I guess.
3583500	3585500	I gotta say this, everyone's giggling.
3585500	3589500	18 inches tall. She can sing, dance, and totally make out with you.
3589500	3594500	I guess there is a love mode where she'll hug you and kiss nearby humans.
3594500	3595500	Wow.
3595500	3597500	She looks like an eyebo.
3597500	3598500	That's great.
3598500	3608500	It's apparently 18,000 yen or 166 dollars US if you're actually interested in this, and it's coming out in September in Japan only.
3608500	3611500	So you gotta import them girlfriends.
3611500	3614500	So what do we call her? EE for short?
3614500	3616500	Emma.
3616500	3617500	Mm-hmm.
3617500	3618500	EE.
3618500	3619500	EE.
3619500	3620500	Okay.
3620500	3622500	She looks like a freakin' eyebo, though.
3622500	3625500	Whoosh.
3625500	3626500	Nice.
3626500	3627500	Whatever.
3627500	3631500	What's the name of the cooking game that was brought up earlier? A couple people have been asking.
3631500	3633500	Um, okay, I have to...
3633500	3636500	It's Cooking Guy. Can't decide what to eat.
3636500	3639500	Alright, Darsakko will get on that later.
3639500	3643500	But for now, we're going to reveal who won tonight's List List.
3643500	3647500	Hooray.
3647500	3651500	The top three songs, the definitive list of the best Bomani songs of all time.
3651500	3654500	Not that there was any controversy in this process at all.
3654500	3657500	However, it's time to reveal the list.
3657500	3669500	Your number three pick was Bitmania.
3669500	3670500	What was your number three pick?
3670500	3686500	Your number two pick, and this kind of surprised me, was Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.
3686500	3694500	And the number one best Bomani song of all freakin' time as voted by you,
3694500	3711500	in our chatroom based on our list here in studio, was Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove.
3711500	3715500	Which kind of fits that an Aoki song should take the title.
3715500	3716500	Well, there you have it.
3716500	3717500	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3717500	3720500	Our not controversial at all list.
3720500	3726500	Alright, Skulk, one point away from being on that list, and lots of them tied there in the back too.
3726500	3728500	Okay, I have a bone to pick with Skulk.
3728500	3729500	Uh oh, what's that?
3729500	3732500	It makes me drive too fast.
3732500	3735500	There's nothing wrong with that.
3735500	3741500	Alright, well, it's time for the Skype line, where you can give us a call.
3741500	3744500	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3744500	3748500	But, tonight we have a little twist on the Skype line.
3748500	3750500	We know it's an anniversary show.
3750500	3753500	We know there's a lot of people that want to call in tonight, probably.
3753500	3756500	At least there's been quite a few people in chat telling me they want to call.
3756500	3757500	We encourage everybody to call in tonight.
3757500	3759500	We'll give a little extra time for that to happen.
3759500	3763500	But, tonight we're doing something special for the phone calls.
3763500	3767500	And that is reviving one of our old favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3767500	3771500	It's something we like to call Ask Orange Lounge.
3771500	3780500	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
3780500	3783500	What will we find out on the sixth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio?
3783500	3787500	You can call in and ask us a question now.
3787500	3791500	1-877-GAME-OLR or look us up on Skype.
3791500	3800500	Alright, so tonight, questions only on Skype.
3800500	3808500	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
3808500	3810500	And yes, I pulled that right off the top of my head.
3810500	3812500	So, let's go to the first phone call.
3812500	3817500	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
3817500	3822500	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio. ¿Quien es?
3822500	3824500	Okay, we have a broken phone call there.
3824500	3826500	Hey, wouldn't you know, a live radio, we're going to get that.
3826500	3829500	It would be so fitting that our first phone call would be a broken one.
3829500	3831500	Please make sure you test your connection first.
3831500	3834500	It's echo123 if you'd like to test your Skype.
3834500	3836500	You know what else we do need to do at some point?
3836500	3838500	What's that? Play old bumpers.
3838500	3840500	Okay, we'll do that before the night is over.
3840500	3842500	Get up, get up, get busy, busy before the night is over.
3842500	3846500	Alright, we have a call and this is a frequent caller, so I know this connection works.
3846500	3848500	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
3848500	3849500	It's GS68.
3849500	3852500	Hello, GS68. How are you?
3852500	3854500	Alright, I have a question for Junami.
3854500	3856500	Have a piece of cake first. It is our sixth anniversary.
3856500	3857500	There's a cake.
3857500	3858500	The cake is a lie.
3858500	3859500	Wait, you have to say-
3859500	3860500	No.
3860500	3862500	No, you have to say nom nom nom because you're eating cake.
3862500	3864500	Nom nom, Nintendo official, whatever.
3864500	3867500	Alright, there you go. What is your question for Junami tonight?
3867500	3871500	Have you continued playing La Milana or did you give up on it?
3871500	3875500	I haven't had much time to play La Milana, but I will get into it.
3875500	3883500	It's Nintendo hard, it's Battletoads hard, so I may get into it once I'm finished playing Hellgate for a while.
3883500	3885500	It gets easier later on.
3885500	3891500	I think as far as my Battletoads hard games go, I may start with I want to be the guy.
3891500	3894500	I want to be the guy that's just retarded.
3894500	3896500	Apples don't fall up.
3896500	3898500	They're more like giant cherries.
3898500	3899500	Exactly.
3899500	3902500	Alright, GS68, thank you for the question. Enjoy your cake!
3902500	3903500	Thanks.
3903500	3909500	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR, your username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3909500	3914500	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
3914500	3916500	Yes, we're going to go there.
3916500	3924500	Apparently, just in time for brand new homebrew, a brand new program has just come out called the Wii Braider.
3924500	3927500	Can you guess what it does?
3927500	3930500	I don't know. I will think about that during this call.
3930500	3933500	Hold on. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
3933500	3935500	Hi, this is Spaznator.
3935500	3938500	Spaznator, what's on your mind? What's your question tonight for us?
3938500	3940500	Oh, wait first. Hold on, hold on.
3940500	3944500	Wait, wait Spaznator. You have to enjoy the cake. Nom nom nom.
3944500	3945500	Nom nom nom.
3945500	3947500	Alright, there you go. What's your question for us tonight?
3947500	3960500	Yeah, I was wondering, just off the top of your head, do you know if there's any chance in hell that WoW will be coming to either the PS3 or to the F360?
3960500	3964500	Don't count on it, sir. This is a rumor that comes up often.
3964500	3967500	And you know, we have of course nothing official to back this up, but here's the thing.
3967500	3971500	WoW has sold millions and millions and millions of copies as it is on the PC.
3971500	3979500	And I think Blizzard realizes that most people that own consoles also own PCs somewhere in their home, so there really wouldn't be a lot of crossover potential.
3979500	3994500	Plus, I think they probably look at games that, you know, came out like Final Fantasy XI, which is a really weird analogy to use because Final Fantasy XI was originally developed for the PlayStation 2 and that's how a lot of people in Japan play it, but damn, I cannot play that game unless it's on a PC.
3994500	4001500	It's kind of hard to port a PC game to a console, especially when you consider, you know, how many different things there are to do.
4001500	4008500	And while the, you know, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 can take, or PlayStation 3, excuse me, can take keyboards, not a lot of people have that elaborate setup.
4008500	4012500	And I think for your game to succeed, you have to keep it simple to the console basics.
4012500	4021500	Now, here's the other thing, though. Would a WoW spinoff game like an arcade game or something else in the Warcraft universe be counted out for console?
4021500	4030500	Not necessarily. Look at Starcraft Ghost, even though that was cancelled. Something along those lines, I would say, is a much bigger possibility than actually seeing WoW itself on consoles.
4030500	4036500	Look at Champions of Norrath. That was an EverQuiz spinoff. That worked fairly well.
4036500	4038500	Except not a lot of people seem to play it for whatever reason.
4038500	4046500	Now, Warcraft 2, I mean, or World of Warcraft 2, I should more accurately say, if that ever comes out, who knows? Maybe something that's co-developed for consoles.
4046500	4055500	But honestly, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Blizzard has the biggest MMO in the world ten times over other competition. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
4055500	4068500	MMOs don't really work for consoles. I mean, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online and its sequels and Final Fantasy XI, name a successful console MMO in the States.
4068500	4083500	Yeah, I can't think of any. The only two I ever played was Final Fantasy XI and the console version of EverQuest, which came out for the PS2, but I thought the PS2 version of EverQuest was kind of crappy, though.
4083500	4090500	I don't know a lot of people that play Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, but Final Fantasy XI in Japan is huge on consoles.
4090500	4094500	And I know a lot of people hear the play it. It's probably the most successful console MMO.
4094500	4099500	But anyway, Spaznator, we gotta go so we can get some more questions, but thanks for your question. Enjoy your cake.
4099500	4100500	Sure, thanks.
4100500	4104500	Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.
4104500	4107500	So, Wii and vibrator thing?
4107500	4116500	Yeah, Wii-brator. It's just like it sounds. It is a piece of software to turn your Wii remote into a vibrator.
4116500	4118500	They have one of this for iPods.
4118500	4127500	And it says, it's some sort of thing, it says events, vibrator simulation.
4127500	4132500	Alright, let's go back to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio. Who's this?
4132500	4134500	Dead Pixels Zone, Raven's Dolphin.
4134500	4141500	Raven's Dolphin, the one and only, the man, the legend. Raven's Dolphin, please enjoy some cake.
4141500	4143500	I'm enjoying some pie, but that's okay.
4143500	4145500	That's alright. Pie is your preference.
4145500	4149500	Alright, Raven's Dolphin, what is your question for us here on OLR tonight?
4149500	4157500	My question to you is, over the years, you're all gamers, how much do you think you spent over the years of gaming?
4157500	4167500	I actually added up just my Bemani collection one time, and exceeded a few thousand dollars on just that.
4167500	4176500	So, I would have to say that I would value my video game collection right now at maybe about 15,000, maybe more?
4176500	4178500	Wouldn't you say?
4178500	4184500	I honestly don't know Raven's Dolphin, and if I were to think about it, I would probably want to go hang myself.
4184500	4186500	No, not really, not really. I shouldn't be ashamed of it.
4186500	4189500	But, you know, think about the MMOs I've played over the years.
4189500	4192500	You know, $15 a month here, $12 a month there.
4192500	4199500	That alone has been, I spend easily $100 a month, and then during the holidays, new consoles come out even more on games.
4199500	4202500	God, it's a lot, Raven's Dolphin.
4202500	4209500	Easily, probably in the time that we've been doing OLR alone, I would say, what, six years? $10,000. Easily.
4209500	4213500	Do consoles and PC hardware count in that?
4213500	4215500	Everything that is gaming.
4215500	4227500	I'd have to say, aside from games that were lost, I'd say hardware and software, easily $3,000, $4,000 worth of games.
4227500	4235500	It includes the computers I've built, and the consoles that I've bought, and monthly fees. It's really a lot.
4235500	4238500	Loki, you do even dare to answer this question?
4238500	4241500	I don't even know. I'm not even going to try to guess.
4241500	4244500	It will make me want to cry.
4244500	4248500	So, Raven's Dolphin, thank you very much for your call, making us all want to slash our wrists.
4248500	4249500	I'm sorry, bye.
4249500	4250500	Enjoy your cake.
4250500	4256500	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, where our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4256500	4257500	We have another call coming in.
4257500	4260500	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
4260500	4266500	Hello there, OrangeLounge. This is the, well, what? The other one from Sweden.
4266500	4270500	Our Swedish listener. We love you. How are you?
4270500	4272500	Hello.
4272500	4277500	Well, for you, an extra big piece of cake. Enjoy. Nom nom nom.
4277500	4283500	Um, duh, damn. Just, ow, damn. Just a minute.
4283500	4286500	Okay, what was my question?
4286500	4292500	I think there was a weird, like, intergalactical transmission while he was trying to eat cake there.
4292500	4295500	I was getting flashbacks from Max Headroom.
4295500	4298500	No, we're in dream cakes in my case.
4298500	4301500	Alright, okay, what's your question? I'm sorry.
4301500	4309500	My question was, Rob, how do you enjoy the end-gaming in World of Warcraft?
4309500	4311500	How am I enjoying end-gaming in World of Warcraft?
4311500	4316500	Great question, because I've been recently going into raids, 25-man raids now, like Serpent Shrine Cavern,
4316500	4325500	and it's amazing how well-organized a lot of groups are and almost treat it like it's like a job.
4325500	4328500	Like, it's amazing, like, you know, you gotta show up on time and you gotta be there,
4328500	4331500	and if you don't perform well, then you may not come back the next week,
4331500	4334500	and it's fascinating the kind of culture around it.
4334500	4340500	But as far as some, there certainly isn't a shortage of things to do when you hit level 70 in WoW.
4340500	4344500	I think Blizzard's done a pretty good job of having a lot of end-game content,
4344500	4348500	and the thing I really like about WoW, especially versus Final Fantasy XI,
4348500	4352500	I was playing that, and I don't mean to get the Final Fantasy XI fans to hate me,
4352500	4357500	because certainly there is a huge sense of accomplishment when you hit a job level 75
4357500	4364500	in Final Fantasy XI, but it's so much more achievable to actually hit an end-game character in WoW
4364500	4367500	and get into that content than it was in Final Fantasy XI.
4367500	4371500	I mean, I played for many years Final Fantasy XI, and I got maybe as high as like 56,
4371500	4374500	I mean, just because I kept going back and forth between characters and stuff,
4374500	4377500	and so I never really got to experience end-game content there,
4377500	4380500	so I think WoW found a really good balance.
4380500	4382500	End-game content in Final Fantasy XI.
4382500	4392500	Well, but here's the other thing. Isn't that that Blizzard is actively pushing people
4392500	4401500	getting towards the end since Squeenix didn't do that exactly?
4401500	4405500	Well, yeah, because Blizzard has kind of reduced the experience caps to make it quicker
4405500	4408500	to get to the Burning Crusade content, and the kind of speculation is
4408500	4411500	there's going to be kind of an easier way to get to 80 too.
4411500	4416500	You're going to be able to make characters that start at level 55 in the new expansion,
4416500	4420500	but you have to already have a level 55, but it's still kind of interesting that they're doing that.
4420500	4425500	But yeah, I love how Blizzard patches their game like all the time with new stuff,
4425500	4428500	and to be fair, you know, other MMOs I've played, and I keep going back to Final Fantasy XI,
4428500	4430500	but only because I've played that for so long, they do that too,
4430500	4436500	but Blizzard, when they have a whole freaking new zone to it with new quests, it's great.
4436500	4440500	Well, the reason behind all that motivation, I mean, Rob, you're into end-game now,
4440500	4445500	you're raiding, you know how certain encounters are gear checks, and some are skill checks?
4445500	4449500	You go to Karazhan nowadays, which is your starting raid.
4449500	4452500	Nightbane? That is your motivation check.
4452500	4456500	If you keep wiping to Nightbane and you give up, you're not cut out for raiding.
4456500	4458500	You know what's funny? I still haven't fought Nightbane.
4458500	4461500	Every time my guild beat it, I wasn't there, but we pretty much have Chara on farm status now.
4461500	4464500	I never got to Chara. I stopped raiding at Molten Core.
4464500	4466500	Oh, well that's also nice. See, I missed all that stuff.
4466500	4474500	By the way, thanks for the thing on Nightbane, whatever your name was, since I don't remember.
4474500	4475500	It's Drew.
4475500	4483500	Drew, thank you. The reason I'm asking is that a few, like last week or so,
4483500	4492500	I myself actually dinged 70 on a shaman, troll shaman, so there's my reason for asking, by the way.
4492500	4498500	Well, Gratz, just take it nice and easy, work on getting your gear up, and you'll be ready for Chara in no time.
4498500	4501500	Prepare for a lifetime of healing. That's all I have to say.
4501500	4502500	Well, it depends what type he is.
4502500	4504500	All right, we've got to let you go though, buddy. We're running over.
4504500	4505500	Yeah, thank you.
4505500	4506500	Take care.
4506500	4507500	Bye-bye.
4507500	4509500	Thanks for the question. Enjoy your cake.
4509500	4513500	All right, 1877gameolr, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4513500	4518500	I would think you'd know that by now, but if you don't, there you have it again.
4518500	4521500	Any other last minute stories for us, Loki, while we wait for a few more calls?
4521500	4522500	I have one.
4522500	4523500	Oh, we got another call, sorry.
4523500	4527500	Hi, Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
4527500	4528500	Hello, you are?
4528500	4529500	Hi, this is Gold Banjo.
4529500	4534500	Hi, Gold Banjo. Do you have a... Oh, wait, first, we'd like you to have a piece of cake. Here you go.
4534500	4536500	Oh, yummy, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
4536500	4539500	We'll take it. All right, what's on your mind, Gold Banjo?
4539500	4541500	Yeah, I know I did it a little wrong.
4541500	4547500	Anyway, speaking of cake and pie and all that good stuff, what's your guys' favorite desserts?
4547500	4554500	There's the randomness I've come to love and expect out of Orange Launch Radio. Ask Orange Launch. Dark Sakura.
4554500	4560500	It was, for the longest time, carrot cake, but I have found something that I think I like just a little bit more,
4560500	4568500	and that's carrot cake cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory. Stuff is fucking awesome. Amen.
4568500	4569500	I love carrot cake.
4569500	4572500	That sounds good. Loki.
4572500	4578500	My favorite dessert had to have been from my old boss that I worked under at Round Table.
4578500	4584500	He opened his own restaurant called BJ's, and he had a... it was a 50-50, basically, you know,
4584500	4591500	orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and stuff like that. It was fucking awesome.
4591500	4595500	And unfortunately, no other 50-50s have been equal to it, so...
4595500	4599500	Well, speaking of BJ's, there's a restaurant chain. I don't know how wide this chain is.
4599500	4600500	The Brewery.
4600500	4604500	Yeah, the Brewery. It's called BJ's, and they have a dessert there that is definitely my favorite.
4604500	4605500	The Pizookie.
4605500	4611500	It's called the Pizookie. The peanut butter Pizookie is so frickin' good. Oh my God.
4611500	4613500	I have sadness about the Pizookie.
4613500	4614500	What?
4614500	4619500	I actually... they... I can't... I've had one twice now, and both times I've gotten violently ill.
4619500	4624500	Oh, it's a crime, because those things are so frickin' good. I'm sorry. I won't say it.
4624500	4627500	I feel your pain. I can't have them anymore because of the low-fat thing.
4627500	4630500	So, there you have it. Drew, quickly.
4630500	4640500	Alright, cake pie jokes aside, I'd have to say mine's a toss-up between classic root beer float and chocolate soup.
4640500	4642500	Ew, that sounds gross.
4642500	4654500	No, no, chocolate soup... here we are. Chocolate soup is warm chocolate brownie, fudge brownie, topped with chocolate pudding and chocolate whipped cream.
4654500	4656500	Well, you bastard, thanks.
4656500	4657500	It's really good.
4657500	4663500	Thanks for making us all hungry, but no, I'm just kidding. Really quickly, do you have a favorite dessert, Gold Banjo?
4663500	4672500	Ah, jeez. I should have probably thought of that before I even came on. I don't know. I just like ice cream.
4672500	4679500	With roclo, please. Now you've learned your lesson. Don't dish it out if you can't take it. No, I'm kidding.
4679500	4682500	I know, it's hard when you're put on the spot. We've had six years to practice.
4682500	4687500	Alright, well, Gold Banjo, enjoy your cake, and we'll put a little ice cream on it for you, and enjoy, and thanks for the question.
4687500	4689500	Yep, bye.
4689500	4694500	Alright, 1877 game OLR, username on Skyporns, launch radio, Jamie, you had a last minute story.
4694500	4697500	I did, and this was once sent to us by Rob with two B's.
4697500	4698500	Yes.
4698500	4700500	You know, I love Disneyland.
4700500	4701500	Me too.
4701500	4702500	I love California Adventure.
4702500	4703500	I want to go back to Disneyland.
4703500	4708500	But you know, California Adventure is being given this massive facelift, right?
4708500	4710500	Makeover.
4710500	4712500	Well, yeah.
4712500	4716500	At any rate, because, well, they've lost a lot of money.
4716500	4729500	So what they've done at Paradise Pier is they've taken a lot of the Midway stuff, and underneath California Screamin', which is the big roller coaster there, they put something called Midway Mania.
4729500	4735500	Which is, it's, I'm trying to find exactly.
4735500	4736500	That's not the new Toy Story ride?
4736500	4737500	No.
4737500	4738500	Oh, I thought it was.
4738500	4740500	No, no, it is, sorry, it is the new Toy Story ride.
4740500	4741500	Oh, okay.
4741500	4742500	Which looks cool.
4742500	4747500	But it's basically different 3D challenges and mini games and stuff that goes through it.
4747500	4749500	So it's pretty cool.
4749500	4752500	I was trying to bring the gamer in.
4752500	4754500	And that kind of goes along with the Astro Blaster.
4754500	4755500	That's like Astro Blaster.
4755500	4756500	I love Astro Blaster.
4756500	4757500	It's like my second favorite ride at all at Disneyland.
4757500	4758500	Remember when it froze?
4758500	4759500	Yes.
4759500	4760500	And we kept hitting the target.
4760500	4762500	You got like the 10th highest score of the day or something crazy.
4762500	4763500	I think I did.
4763500	4764500	It was crazy.
4764500	4765500	We got another call.
4765500	4766500	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry.
4766500	4767500	I'm sorry to make you wait.
4767500	4768500	Kitsune.
4768500	4769500	Kitsune.
4769500	4772500	I don't think I've ever heard you call in before.
4772500	4773500	You're a first time caller, aren't you?
4773500	4774500	This is my first time.
4774500	4775500	I'm a brand new listener.
4775500	4777500	Well, welcome to the program.
4777500	4779500	I'm sorry it's only short calls tonight, but do you have a question?
4779500	4780500	Oh, wait, wait, first.
4780500	4781500	I'm so sorry.
4781500	4784500	Please enjoy as first time caller an extra large slice of cake.
4784500	4785500	Nom, nom, nom.
4785500	4786500	Yes, very good.
4786500	4787500	All right.
4787500	4788500	What's on your mind?
4788500	4794500	I was walking through IKEA bar the other day and I've been really late on my gaming news.
4794500	4795500	I haven't really kept up with it.
4795500	4800500	And I saw the new Soul Calibur IV ad that's coming out July 31st.
4800500	4804500	And I was kind of surprised to see Yoda on there because I hadn't really heard anything
4804500	4805500	about it.
4805500	4809500	So I was wondering if you guys had heard anything about that.
4809500	4813500	Well, there has been quite a bit of news in the States here about what's going on with
4813500	4814500	Soul Calibur IV.
4814500	4820500	We also had Darth Vader in the PS3 version too.
4820500	4823500	Yeah, somehow Star Wars is suddenly colliding with Soul Calibur World.
4823500	4826500	I don't know what kind of weird licensing is going on there.
4826500	4830500	But yes, Yoda will be in the Xbox 360 version and Darth Vader will be in the PlayStation
4830500	4832500	3 version of Soul Calibur IV.
4832500	4835500	Both versions will have the apprentice guy.
4835500	4837500	I don't remember what his name was.
4837500	4838500	The secret apprentice from...
4838500	4843500	Not Donald Trump's apprentice but Darth Vader's apprentice from the Force Unleashed games
4843500	4845500	which are coming out very soon.
4845500	4849500	Well, so it's only one character per release for console?
4849500	4852500	Well, two if you count the Star Wars guy because he'll be in both.
4852500	4858500	But here's the other thing is I would speculate that since you kind of cross now into the
4858500	4862500	Star Wars territory that in the create your own fighter mode, I bet you you'll be able
4862500	4865500	to have a lightsaber and kind of, you know, there'll be a little bit of that in the create
4865500	4866500	your fighter mode.
4866500	4868500	But it's probably going to be like an unlockable.
4868500	4870500	That's a prediction not based on fact.
4870500	4873500	And we're all praying there won't be another Star Wars Masters of Terikasi.
4873500	4878500	Yeah, I'm not sure the Japanese are going to eat that game up because they love Star
4878500	4879500	Wars.
4879500	4880500	You see it everywhere.
4880500	4881500	You even see it in porn stores.
4881500	4885500	You know what, and maybe that would explain why because when we saw it announced here,
4885500	4889500	the reaction was kind of like, what the hell kind of random pairing is that?
4889500	4892500	You know, like, but then you kind of go well, I guess it'll work.
4892500	4894500	I guess if spawn can be in it, why not?
4894500	4895500	But that makes a lot of sense.
4895500	4899500	You know, if it's more of a cultural thing in Japan, they're probably blah, blah, blah,
4899500	4902500	you know, goo goo gaga over it, hoping to make up.
4902500	4905500	They have a whole island Toys R Us dedicated to it.
4905500	4908500	So hoping to make up some of the ground that maybe Soul Calibur 3 lost because it wasn't
4908500	4911500	quite as well received, at least over here, although I thought it was still great.
4911500	4913500	Mostly because it corrupted memory cards.
4913500	4915500	No, that's only a story.
4915500	4918500	Well, kitsune, we got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.
4918500	4919500	Thank you.
4919500	4923500	We always enjoy hearing what's going on across the ocean.
4923500	4925500	We can we can have a good one.
4925500	4929500	We're getting more and more Japanese listeners lately, which is kind of neat because we have
4929500	4931500	Akuma JP in the Justin TV chat.
4931500	4933500	We get a few on email once in a while.
4933500	4934500	Sweet.
4934500	4936500	We love hearing from other people in different parts of the country.
4936500	4939500	In fact, I was just thinking of one of our listeners.
4939500	4940500	I don't know if he's listening tonight.
4940500	4943500	Footy monster the other day because he's in Argentina.
4943500	4944500	He was in the chat room today.
4944500	4946500	My roommate is in Argentina right now.
4946500	4950500	He's in Buenos Aires with his sister and he's been posting updates to live journal.
4950500	4952500	Footy monster is in there right now.
4952500	4953500	Is he in chat?
4953500	4954500	Yeah.
4954500	4955500	Oh, cool.
4955500	4957500	You should tell me some fun things to do in Buenos Aires.
4957500	4958500	I can pass along to my roommate.
4958500	4961500	You know who else is in chat who's not reading his PMs?
4961500	4963500	Bobby Blackwall.
4963500	4965500	Is that is that your not so private message?
4965500	4966500	All right.

5081500	5087260	room it was I don't know I mean it was it was a it was a pretty it was a mix of
5087260	5093580	everything slightly bigger than the one last year um well I mean the the
5093580	5096300	centerpiece was pretty much brawl for that matter
5096300	5102360	Smash Brothers brawl so it was like people feening on that game but they had
5102360	5107180	an every other state every other anime convention game staple like third
5107180	5114660	strike DDA wait not DDR to the X other anime base games and that was about it
5114660	5120340	Oh sounds like you had a pretty rockin time I just want I want pictures of the

5164780	5170100	something about it's it's that special party atmosphere well Jamie likes tits
5170100	5173300	too yes we're slowly turning you straight Rob
5173300	5182300	all right it's a vast fucking conspiracy I'm still hearing myself my friend you
5182300	5185780	got to figure out how to make your sound card echo one two three sir
5185780	5190980	there's actually studies out there that say it's actually pretty much across the
5190980	5194180	board for guys to have an obsession with boobs no matter if they're gay or
5194180	5198620	straight so all right let's go to the thanks for making me doubt Jamie we're
5198620	5201380	going to another phone to me I don't know maybe boobs will get brought up in
5201380	5205540	this conversation we'll see hi here on orange launch radio who's this hey this
5205540	5212060	is Bobby hi but did you say booby no I said Bobby all right hi hi Bobby how
5212060	5217420	are you my friend I'm doing good now you at being our neighbor on all games calm
5217420	5222680	and and definitely I'm helping save our show and the evil live 365 you know
5222680	5226580	almost shut us down you my friend get an extra large piece of cake so here enjoy
5226580	5234660	some cake yes that was awesome I think the cops are gonna go shut down the
5234660	5237700	party at Bobby's house he's having too much fun all right what is your question
5237700	5242940	for us my friend well you guys have been following music games for a long time
5242940	5246180	and I've been listening to you guys for a long time a lot of people probably
5246180	5250540	don't know that I listen to you guys before I made my show I even listen to
5250540	5255180	you guys I remember listening to a few live shows before the to-go edition
5255180	5259820	that's crazy because I honestly thought no one was listening to us I'm sure I'm
5259820	5265420	just kidding so but I hear you guys you know kind of complaining about the state
5265420	5268580	of music games sometimes today and you know complaining about certain aspects
5268580	5273620	of music games so what would a music game have to be and what would it need
5273620	5278060	to have for you to not complain about it to be made if it was made today what
5278060	5286220	would a music game have to have or be for us to not bitch about well okay like
5286220	5290180	if I was gonna go you know it's necessarily routed original from the
5290180	5293600	kitchen I don't think originally even has to be the case because if you look
5293600	5298780	at like DDR and stuff it's been almost the same throughout every release but I
5298780	5303380	think the thing it's kind of been lost especially with like DDR recently is you
5303380	5306620	know with DDR there's when you look at the track list and stuff there's like
5306620	5310140	songs in there you're like wow that's really cool I want to find out more
5310140	5313700	about this artist or something like that or oh that's really cool I'm gonna check
5313700	5318540	out some more music of that genre or something like that but right now the
5318540	5322620	new releases that come out it's just like oh look this was on beatmania let's
5322620	5326340	put it in DDR oh hey look there's another game from guitar freaks let's
5326340	5331220	throw it in DDR oh hey look this is a you know a top 10 song right now on the
5331220	5336120	pop charts hey let's put it in DDR it's there's no real exploration with the
5336120	5339600	music there they're not really they're worried about appealing to the masses
5339600	5343740	instead of just let's put some good stuff in there and that's it they should
5343740	5348860	let us make one I've kind of said this before on the show and I still stand by
5348860	5353540	this my problem with DDR is that it kind of has slipped into this whole it's just
5353540	5358020	song song list update of the year and there's not a whole lot I mean they try
5358020	5361420	to do some new things with every game but I don't know DDR is starting to feel
5361420	5365580	a little bit slow to me and I think I've said this before and I still believe
5365580	5369780	that DDR needs to be rebuilt from the ground up completely and maybe throw a
5369780	5373860	competitive twist in I liked I even see the last great mix that I thought there
5373860	5378220	was was backs too because they had you know you would have to play the songs
5378220	5382420	and then you would earn points or whatever to unlock the next song and it
5382420	5386740	was at random of what song would be unlocked next and that got people to the
5386740	5389420	arcade because there's people just sitting there playing on the damn
5389420	5393580	machine to unlock what song would come out next and no one was spoiled by like
5393580	5397900	releasing the full song list thank you Konami for every single fucking home
5397900	5402600	release that you spoil the entire song list for you know there's no surprises
5402600	5407140	whatsoever and for God's sake I do not want to play through another fucking
5407140	5414020	quest mode to unlock shit okay that was never fun ever um I think it did hit the
5414020	5417180	nail on the head with something I'll get that I know Jamie was talked to um
5417180	5421900	arcades I think the fact that arcades have gone downhill have sadly made the
5421900	5425900	whole music game scene kind of follow and it's just it's tragic there's really
5425900	5428220	and there's not a lot that could be helped with that dark soccer I was just
5428220	5434180	gonna say the versus mode in Disney's rave that was freaking epic and that was
5434180	5439700	the way to properly do versus battle in a DDR game and bring back keyboard mania
5439700	5444500	here's the problem and I'm gonna catch some flak for this I love Konami to
5444500	5451620	death but still every time a competing company comes up with something to
5451620	5458460	enhance the DDR formula what does kami do konami sues the pants off of them it
5458460	5462340	happened with on demeero with pump it up happened with rock sore and in the groove
5462340	5468060	they both added shit to the DDR formula and they are both rejected no they did
5468060	5471700	not add anything to the formula all you guys rip it off and try to call it their
5471700	5474940	own seriously that's all they did oh they made the
5474940	5481860	new arrows that you have to stop on a lot Oh original Oh holding it Oh mines lame
5481860	5490740	mines was retarded okay it's retarded that's song list was bad okay but you
5490740	5495420	know what it's a controversial thing yeah two good songs and in the group all
5495420	5499780	right all right I gotta ask cuz this phone call is getting to be epic length
5499780	5503340	but since Bobby you know obviously is a man with well-spoken opinions and has
5503340	5506420	been listening to the show for a very long time and obviously has been
5506420	5509700	following music games as well how about a little I what do what do you think
5509700	5513580	what do you think music games need well I just have to turn it back on me I
5513580	5519820	didn't have an answer cuz that's what I do I mean my big problem with like you
5519820	5525920	know the bimani games and stuff was that it relied so much on in-house music you
5525920	5529940	know the music tracks and stuff and you know what that's why it didn't work here
5529940	5534220	well in the States and I mean I remember back you know when I started fine when I
5534220	5538980	started playing Beatmania on the ps1 I you know had an import console and I
5538980	5543260	imported the games and stuff back in the 90s I was like man I wish this genre
5543260	5547380	would come out in the States I wish it would get big in the States and I kept
5547380	5551300	waiting for something you know other than DDR because I don't want to move my
5551300	5555860	legs you know and that's why I was really happy to see you know Guitar Hero
5555860	5560460	finally figure it out that you know hey you got to put in songs people recognize
5560460	5565900	and so I thought that was really a really great way to do it however I can
5565900	5570100	see Guitar Hero and rock band possibly becoming the new Madden where it's you
5570100	5576740	know roster update 2008 here by another set of songs for $60 and now what's
5576740	5579980	different between this and Madden is that now you're gonna have to buy new
5579980	5584340	guitars each time or new controllers because you know they make the
5584340	5589420	controllers better between Guitar Hero 1 & 2 and Guitar Hero 2 & 3 exactly so I
5589420	5592980	they just they need to have there needs to be some standardization that's what
5592980	5598060	would make me not complain is some standardization so I can enjoy all of the
5598060	5603380	games without having to spend Ravens dolphins question of you know $20,000 on
5603380	5611580	gaming equipment I was just gonna say we need a US pop and music yes I think you
5611580	5614420	hit the nail on the head with something kind of in there at least there's
5614420	5618420	something I drew from it I think the reason why Bahmani didn't succeed as
5618420	5622580	well outside of DDR in the States is the Konami didn't believe in it and have no
5622580	5626580	one but themselves to blame they should have tried it a lot sooner and they
5626580	5629460	could have gotten a piece of this Guitar Hero drum mania craze now they just look
5629460	5633420	like they're third place with this whole rock revolution thing and and shame on
5633420	5637980	them for not realizing what they had before you know cuz yeah like you've
5637980	5642620	been playing beat mania since the early or not really nice lately 90s and beat
5642620	5646260	mania didn't even make an appearance here in the States until a year and a
5646260	5651140	half ago with a fairly you know I don't want to say it was a half-assed game but
5651140	5654580	considering how long it took for it to get here I appreciate they tried some
5654580	5656900	different things like having the five key and the seven key in the same game
5656900	5662900	was cool but you know why Konami didn't believe in it for new songs we got in
5662900	5667340	that game and the least it was make harder note files for virtual insanity
5667340	5671180	and they they could if they had a little more faith in it I think we would have
5671180	5676980	seen something a little more you know involved you know I mean I know they
5676980	5682100	tried because I remember like my actually my first ever experience with
5682100	5687580	beat mania was actually at one of the very old III's think maybe 98 Konami
5687580	5692180	actually had their hip-hop mania arcade machine in the booth because they were
5692180	5696500	testing it in certain arcades in Chicago all right and I fell in love with it
5696500	5700940	then and that's when I went out to go find the ps1 versions you know it
5700940	5704340	started me off with it people complaining about the whole you know
5704340	5709740	emulator in symphile market is my first beat mania experience with was BM 98
5709740	5715180	back in the day and that's when I went out you know hunting for my five key
5715180	5719180	controller and getting a stack of games you know at network video when they
5719180	5726020	still sold games and weren't closed but I mean I think you know that also used
5726020	5729300	to say that you know the companies I think should be looking towards the
5729300	5732620	people that are making the emulators and sim files because that right there I
5732620	5737300	think is going to be your key indicator of what the community wants you know
5737300	5743300	look to that for inspiration just saying I agree all right well Bobby
5743300	5747420	there's been a pretty epic phone call but it's it's definitely something
5747420	5751060	that's a part of our history we like to look back on and you never know I mean I
5751060	5753860	always kind of hope there'll be another beat mania in the u.s. someday I don't
5753860	5757820	hold my breath over it but now it's kind of gotten to the point where it's like
5757820	5762260	well if Konami is not going to do it maybe someone else will because music
5762260	5765740	games have shown they can be successful here in the States but I do agree I hope
5765740	5769060	they get standardized because I think that's where the it's all gonna fall
5769060	5771380	apart is when you have to get one controller for this game one control for
5771380	5775580	this game the mainstream is just not gonna buy it and then the next sequel
5775580	5778180	you're gonna have to get a new controller to work do all the stuff
5778180	5781220	that's in the new sequel and stuff but one you know one last thing you know
5781220	5785260	about the pop and I do think that Konami really should try bringing that pop and
5785260	5789580	over here because some people when they come to my apartment I've got my desktop
5789580	5793540	arcade ASC for pop and music everybody looks at that and they're like what's
5793540	5796080	that I'm like yeah that's for another music game they're like oh you mean like
5796080	5799540	guitar hero and I'm like yeah but you slap the butt balloons and they're like
5799540	5804460	wow that that sounds cool music is so great pop music might have a problem
5804460	5808500	coming this stage you got a bit of an image problem but people will see it and
5808500	5811940	think it's a kid's game but as far as I know I think that pop music actually has
5811940	5816060	the biggest following in Japan above the other bimani games and that's not to say
5816060	5819980	Konami can't put a little effort into American izing the game a little bit and
5819980	5823860	I realize there's a lot of people who listen to this show that go you know at
5823860	5827380	the thought of a game getting American eyes but think about it if they how did
5827380	5830940	a guitar hero and rock band become so successful because the song lists were
5830940	5835220	very American I think if pop music could invest you know the development time
5835220	5839100	into you know maybe re-inventing the interface to be a little more you know
5839100	5844060	not so childish and getting some good American songs mixed in with the
5844060	5849900	Japanese favorites it could do well here yep all right Bobby we gotta let you go
5849900	5857180	just take up can I can I have another piece of cake of course you can by the
5857180	5864140	way Bobby the cake was a lie all right just kidding I hung up on no Bobby's
5864140	5868100	awesome all right I will try to get like maybe one more call do you have any
5868100	5873820	other last-minute stories here before we get to them yeah but I want to talk about
5873820	5877180	there's something about Grand Theft Auto and Fox because you remember there is a
5877180	5880100	movie called Grand Theft Auto so now there can't be a movie called Grand
5880100	5887620	Theft Auto and Fox can't make a game based off of Grand Theft Auto nice all
5887620	5892620	right hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this is misty well hello
5892620	5898980	misty how are you I'm doing good even though I have to open in the morning I'm
5898980	5903080	still listening I'm sorry to hear about that well here just for you I have a
5903080	5911460	caffeinated orange piece of cake enjoy awesome nom nom nom oh no mom there you
5911460	5915960	go she sounds excited all right misty what what question do you have for us
5915960	5922860	tonight why did scope get screwed over tonight like it did way the hell back in
5922860	5931140	episode 111 wait why did what I'm sorry I missed it why did what skulk oh why
5931140	5935100	did skulk get screwed over so bad tonight I you know just not enough not
5935100	5939000	enough synth pop fans in chat I think voting for scope but you know what else
5939000	5942420	is that echo image the band behind that song is just kind of falling off the
5942420	5945140	planet and I think it's a darn shame because that whole album is just
5945140	5950540	freaking amazing if you haven't checked it out yeah I know it's it's an
5950540	5956660	understatement seriously it will it's it's better than dessert if I had a band
5956660	5960100	I think I'd name it that it's better than dessert I have a lot of great band
5960100	5962700	names well misty anything else you want to share with our listeners quickly
5962700	5968940	before we shut off for the night I can think of even though I bet I'm gonna get
5968940	5973260	my butt kicked for not asking another another particular question that's all
5973260	5980300	right you another question you were supposed to ask but that's it so you
5980300	5986340	wanted me to ask and ask about the fuck show happens when no one expects it to
5986340	5993420	happen yes like the apocalypse the fuck show but he was one me tonight go on the
5993420	5996500	the fuck show will sneak up on you eventually here's my problem is that now
5996500	6000800	I think we've hyped the fuck show too much and like I don't I don't think it's
6000800	6004140	gonna be that funny when it happens I think it's one of those things we're
6004140	6007100	like halfway through part a we're gonna be like okay we need to stop like all
6007100	6011740	right fuck it but we'll see yeah that's what that
6011740	6015340	would seem like to me too yeah so I'm a little worried about fuck show but it
6015340	6020720	will actually happen when Duke Nukem forever comes out we may hold her to
6020720	6024820	that we may hold her to that all right well misty take care of yourself have a
6024820	6031100	good one okay all righty don't fall asleep tomorrow all right poor thing
