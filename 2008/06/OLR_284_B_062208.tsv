5871	14715	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15415	19057	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19841	20601	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
45515	46536	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
74233	74793	No.
74913	75193	All right.
75594	75854	All right.
76034	78915	But it might be a live action show from what I understand, so yay.
78995	80716	But not like Heroes Heroes.
80836	81756	No, because this is better.
81776	83377	It wouldn't have a crappy second season.
83577	83797	All right.
86018	86658	I sense benefits.
86678	87399	I've heard of that book.
87439	89079	I was actually thinking about picking it up one time.
90060	91080	Then I shall pick it up.
91701	92061	All right.
92881	94262	And I'll actually read it if I pick it up.
97543	99384	We can't hear Shane, so I'm... All right.
100111	103954	Alright, going over to Andrew as well as joining us tonight.
103974	105835	You've known him as several different names throughout the years.
105855	108357	There was, let's see, 23rd Magus and Drew Nami.
109038	112500	He's still here and was 17 when our show started, which makes me feel old.
112621	113882	And I just won't leave.
114222	115463	I was 19, that means.
115683	116483	Oh my god.
116644	117544	I'm still the freshman.
117564	118385	When's my promotion?
118885	119846	I thought of you the other day.
119866	122168	Hooray!
122268	122748	How long ago?
122768	123829	Because I might have already been here.
124990	128573	It was about three days ago when I was at Dimple Records looking at High School Musical 2.
128613	128833	Yeah.
130874	134117	Anyhow, let's get back into some video game news, shall we, Loki?
135658	138921	Well, I will not be talking about High School Musical anything.
139041	139601	Yeah!
139621	142163	It has video games, and that's newsworthy.
142444	143645	No, it's not.
145386	149729	But, there is some other stuff that's a little bit more newsworthy, and it...
150877	151537	Guitar Hero World Tour
170988	175351	Some of the new features with it, they'll actually, the pads are a lot quieter.
175992	180015	Of course, you may remember that the cymbals are a little bit raised up as well.
180635	185059	And you've got three kind of drums on the bottom and of course a kick drum.
186600	190103	And also they will be touch sensitive.
190223	195387	So when you like hit them harder, it'll be louder and so on and so forth.
196891	222664	some other cool stuff also it's wireless now on the guitar remember last week we talked about a certain leak that happened about there being a touch sensitive portion of the guitar well that turns out to be true and actually the I guess brand new touch sensitive slider on the neck will allow you to do all sorts of different things what are you doing?
222824	224905	don't mind the music I'm trying to prep something else for later
225990	226831	www.darksakura.com
246571	256900	And I guess it looks like, yeah, the slider, it says, will allow you to play with sustained notes by finger sliding up the strip area.
257500	260563	And it says also can be used to tap out notes as well.
261364	262344	So that's kind of cool.
264386	267169	And they have lots of pictures on all your favorite gaming sites.
267269	268530	Of course, we did not carry them.
270251	271772	All right, so what do you think?
272233	274034	I think it's neat, but, you know, I...
277370	281113	I'm afraid, though, that Hutch sends a portion on the bottom there for, like, solos and stuff.
281873	285937	It's enough to make it different than Rock Band, but that's about it.
286537	290360	You know, if it was Buttons, they would have just said, hey, you're ripping off Rock Band.
291401	292542	So, I don't know.
292642	293623	I think it's gimmicky.
295484	296365	That's just my opinion.
297126	301689	The guitar looks cool to me, but the drum set totally gave me flashbacks of Drum Mania.
302710	304612	You know, you move the cymbals out and there you go.
307810	312334	Well, I guess we will see what happens in Guitar Hero.
312374	313495	I mean, are you guys going to get it?
314956	316557	I have it on order, but I don't know.
318018	319099	You might cancel that pre-order?
319299	326064	Yeah, because it's just like, I don't know, I don't play much of rock bands, so why would I buy another fucking drum set?
326925	333951	I think it looks cool, and it might be fun to play, but I'm kind of getting tired of buying peripherals and shit for games.
335000	339702	Especially when, you know, they keep changing the guitar up just enough so that you'll have to buy it each year.
340322	340742	Screw it.
342303	342743	Screw it!
343283	348826	Exactly, and besides, you know, it's neat to do the little, like, you know, whammy stuff on there.
349186	357169	They did mention, though, with the new guitar, there's gonna be some pretty cool things you can do with the music editor, which is cool if you're into that, but... I don't know, it's just...
358769	359630	Thank you for watching!
376138	378379	We haven't really heard of anything about Rock Band 2 yet.
378940	382001	And to be honest, and we're probably going to cover this a little later.
382722	383602	Well, yeah, E3.
383682	386264	But to be honest, we're probably going to cover this a little bit later.
386804	393128	There are some other peripherals out there for the current games that look pretty kick-ass as well.
393348	395990	And so, I mean, I don't know.
397331	399252	It's an improvement, but I don't think it's enough.
400372	400773	All right.
401073	401733	Well, moving on.
401793	403314	Hopefully, this is an improvement.
403374	404075	Oh, you want to say something?
404095	404595	No, absolutely not.
405587	407049	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
421403	422603	Yumi Hoshi Yumi Hoshi
451094	453416	who is the card division VP.
453476	455478	I didn't even know Konami had a card division, but there you go.
455798	462023	Quote, we look forward to reaching out to an array of players of all ages and sharing the excitement of the group-oriented role-playing card game Blue Dragon.
462483	470950	It is our expectation that the character designs of esteemed creator Akira Toriyama combined with the unique gameplay of Blue Dragon will create countless new fans within the card game community.
471351	472792	To which I say, meh.
474968	489262	I want to also mention, because I think I've mentioned this before, but the original Guitar Freaks 2 and 3 on the original PlayStation had a song editor in it as well.
489643	496890	So this isn't anything really brand new, but I'm sure people will call it innovative because they forget so soon.
500700	505570	I guess it takes about 10 years before someone forgets about you, so we have a few more years to go before people actually forget about us.
506656	515101	Well, something that, at least a series that I'm pretty sure no one has really forgotten about because Loki brought it up in an earlier part of the show anyway.
515961	523245	The Raiden series, Raiden 4, is coming out on Xbox 360, hopefully in September, developed by Moss.
524406	526347	And we should be seeing it.
526427	531510	Actually, they're saying in Japan by September, according to Famitsu.
531530	532491	Okay.
533411	537916	It will have new stages and Xbox Live support.
538396	540679	You can share your saved games with people.
541760	547126	And it also supports swivel monitors so that you can use it in the portrait position.
549022	553647	So, uh, you know, a lot of the old shooters used to have that capability, you know?
554048	556270	You could turn your TV on the side and it'd work the same way.
556991	566221	So, I think this would be cool, although I don't, you know, don't turn your 15-inch, you know, TVs on their end unless you got a proper stand for it or something, but that's pretty cool.
566301	567763	I love, I love this game series.
567783	568944	It's one of my favorite shooters ever.
569845	570286	So cool.
573476	575097	Well, I'm looking forward to Raiden as well.
575117	578139	I know they have that compilation of the Raiden.
578460	579841	I forget what they call it, Raiden something.
580821	587306	But anyways, some other cool stuff coming out to Xbox 360 pretty soon.
588086	593971	And we've heard about this game for quite a while now, but it's apparently being released, I think, next week, actually.
594091	595892	Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.
596292	597773	Yes, it's coming out on June 25th.
599374	614521	and then there's also another game which is kind of along the same lines as Catan or Carcassonne but Ticket to Ride is another board game now turned Xbox Live Arcade game that's going to be coming out sometime soon.
614581	615641	I've never heard of this.
615962	616542	What's this about?
616602	617462	It's about trains.
618543	624405	You actually move, you set up train routes or whatever and whoever has the longest routes you get points and stuff like that.
625806	627987	It's been pretty popular that people like, you know,
628487	629249	Those other games.
630150	637123	But no word on when that one's coming out, but probably relatively soon now that it has an Xbox.com page.
639166	639507	Hmm.
642037	644238	Well, I guess we'll see what happens with that.
644678	660624	Oh, and actually, the speculation though from Xbox 360 fanboys is that the last time that Xbox pages appeared for unreleased Xbox Live Arcade games, Frogger 2 and Commando 3, they appeared the very next week.
660884	664286	So, happy tree friends, and maybe take it a ride next week.
664966	672189	Well, speaking of speculation and the Xbox 360, you remember that big mass of things that leaked last week?
672209	674850	The rumors that were probably taken down, by the way, the next day.
676131	678892	And nobody wants to comment on that whole situation.
679052	681133	One of the games that was revealed in that was Lips.
681553	682013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
700387	713038	What's kind of interesting is a lot of people have been kind of putting pieces together and then an anonymous tipster showed up on Joystick apparently saying that Inez is actually the ones that are developing lips on the Xbox 360.
713999	720205	And, you know, it kind of makes sense because you already knew that they were working on an Xbox 360 game and it was probably going to be music-based.
720525	722207	All the pieces are coming together.
722667	723708	So, kind of neat.
724690	732876	That just sounds like a game that I recently actually watched a commercial for that's coming out in Japan.
733536	735358	And for the life of me, I'm trying to remember the name of it.
735978	738080	But it's a karaoke game.
738660	746726	And you can actually program your own music into it, as well as sing along with songs that you can enter into it.
746766	748167	And it's something band-based.
750051	759020	I want to say... It made me think of Degrassi because the name is similar to it, but I'm trying to find the name of it, so give me a second.
759040	759881	I'll see if I can't get it.
759901	760642	It's kind of random.
760702	761963	It makes you think of Degrassi.
762163	763905	Well, no, the name looks a lot like it.
765506	769230	There needs to be a game about Degrassi because I watch that show religiously.
769450	771052	What would you do in a Degrassi game?
771632	772693	Fawn over Marco.
773714	774135	Shut up.
777185	779707	Yes, we'll not be fawning over Marco.
781008	782650	Maybe Guitar Hero World Tour, though.
783310	794280	So good news, though, and we were kind of worried about this, but like some of the other music games out there, Guitar Hero 3 downloads will work in Guitar Hero World Tour.
795161	796442	Hooray!
796462	796562	So, uh,
800560	802001	I don't understand why, but whatever
819392	822013	and other rock band related news.
822453	826915	Offspring is going to be having some songs coming soon.
828835	840360	They're supposed to be... Well, I mean, this week we already got Avenged Sevenfold songs, but Offspring is going to be having... As soon as my thing goes back to the stupid page.
840620	840880	Sorry.
844537	844917	There we go.
846017	848538	Sorry, my computer is deciding that it doesn't want to cooperate.
849118	851098	Anyways, come out and play.
851238	852478	Self-esteem gone away.
852638	853179	All I want.
853639	856079	Pretty fly for a white guy and the kids aren't all right.
856419	860340	So that's according to Offspring's official website.
861260	866281	So now I'll actually have all I want in the game and I can pretend I'm playing Crazy Taxi.
867501	867901	Sure.
868661	869461	If that's what I want to do.
871142	871722	Sounds like fun.
872582	872682	Yep.
873405	873745	All right.
874065	877347	Well, what also sounds like fun are these cute little bobbleheads.
877407	882951	They're Halo-themed bobbleheads, and they're going to be coming to you at Comic-Con.
883671	886533	So you actually... What?
887438	887638	DIGASO
911242	918469	and also they're kind of hyping up the Halo novel because there's some people that are into actually just getting novelizations.
919656	920256	Warcraft Novelizations
945374	945454	Hmm.
973740	975382	So, it's actually fairly deep.
976964	978166	If you're interested in such things.
979948	980369	Okay.
982131	982432	Well!
983598	984018	Orange Lounge Radio
1012111	1013652	Sorry, I'm just reading this comment in the chat.
1013732	1017033	SSJ100Matt says, No one will buy the novelization because there's no teabagging in it.
1018834	1022315	Before I forget, too, I did post a link to that commercial in the chat room.
1022876	1025117	It's Daigaso Band Brothers is what it is.
1025777	1026037	All right.
1026677	1028558	Well, let's talk about Listless tonight.
1028738	1032820	Listless is a game we like to play here on Orange Lounge Radio where we come up with the definitive list.
1033820	1034401	of something.
1034761	1037083	And tonight that something is going back to our roots.
1037143	1037964	And we're going to take a look.
1038004	1040986	You know, DDR is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.
1041506	1043308	We're looking at the 6th year of Orange Launch Radio.
1043328	1049993	And if you remember, Orange Launch Radio was formed because DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all actually met playing DDR at the arcade.
1050053	1051034	I know, crazy but true.
1051074	1051955	It's how it actually happened.
1052315	1055358	We all met through that and decided to start this radio show because of it.
1055418	1062043	And so when we started Orange Launch Radio, it was about strictly pretty much music-based video games and what was going on in the scene.
1062123	1062724	Tournaments,
1063184	1064605	and all that kind of stuff.
1065525	1078909	So anyhow, tonight we're actually going to sort of look back at that and try to decide with our scientific listless process the best Bomani song of the past 10 years.
1078969	1081710	That could be DDR, 2DX, anything is fair game.
1082090	1082930	So here's how it works.
1083270	1091813	All five of us here in studio tonight, that would be myself, DarkSakura, Loki, Drew, and Miklatov have all picked their top three, which will compile into a list of 15.
1092953	1093553	Thank you for watching!
1111741	1138992	Who also love Bomani We're probably going to piss you off with the stuff we left out But keep in mind we only had room for three songs on each of our lists over the past ten years And we can pick whatever the hell we want So unfortunately I need to kill Crystal Waters here Because tonight I'm going to try to play clips from the songs For those of you that do not know the Bomani game so well At least you can feel like you know what we're talking about So we can play some clips of the songs for you guys So sorry Crystal Waters, you're out tonight
1139372	1140794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1154568	1158549	Alright, um, it is Turning the Motor Over, from Beatmania.
1159129	1160450	That's my favorite.
1160510	1161650	Oh, there it is.
1162030	1164431	Yeah, it's freaking awesome.
1164491	1165971	Um, I don't know how else to describe it.
1166151	1170133	The singer guy, Jeff Kruse, is like, in a dream with his voice.
1170193	1173214	And, it's a great song.
1173254	1177835	It just got revived in a home version of 2DX Gold, because it's that awesome.
1180277	1184659	This one's actually going to be fun to play.
1186220	1189121	All right, Shane's number three is Turning the Motor Over.
1189201	1190642	Let's go over to Drew.
1190722	1192062	What is your number three pick tonight?
1192462	1194483	My number three pick is Bitmania.
1196204	1202507	Bitmania, and this was from 2DX8thStyle, if I've done my research right.
1205797	1207778	What is it about this song that makes you want to put it on the list?
1208558	1212239	It's old school, and it's got a very clear vocal part to it.
1212620	1215280	It makes it really good to play, especially in the arcade.
1215300	1220342	I remember playing 8th Style over at Scandia for the first time, and this was the first time I played on an arcade machine.
1221550	1224252	Alright, there's Drew's number three pick, Bitmania.
1224313	1226374	We'll start with Loki, what's your number three pick?
1226655	1230318	My number three pick is Reign of Sorrow, and it's from Max 2.
1231679	1235002	And it was fun, it was like, I don't know, I just like the steps in it.
1235923	1239866	And it just has those fun steps as it catches on.
1240047	1244691	Alright, Reign of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick, let's listen to it for a little bit.
1252314	1252635	Chorus.
1252715	1259636	Alright, Reign of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick.
1259997	1261397	You want to go next, Jamie, or do you want me to go?
1261817	1262497	I can go.
1262657	1263277	Alright, what do you want?
1263377	1266538	Brilliant to you, OG, from DDR Second Mix.
1266558	1267479	It's your number three pick.
1267739	1268579	Oh, sorry, my number three?
1268799	1269039	Yeah.
1269259	1270159	Yeah, that's my number three.
1270319	1272280	Alright, Brilliant to you, OG Mix.
1283174	1284035	And why this song?
1284555	1291261	It used to be my very favorite, but I had actually changed my mind on my official number one because of the fun factor.
1291321	1295485	So this one, though, was like the song I played every freaking time.
1295885	1301450	I played a two-second mix because that was my first one that I actually owned.
1301850	1304032	Although the first one I played was a 1.5.
1305093	1305473	Alright.
1305493	1306114	So it's old school.
1307647	1309849	My number three pick, I love this song.
1309889	1311691	It's from Beatmania 2DX.
1311751	1315515	I want to say it showed up early in 5th style, but it actually was a full song in 6th style.
1315975	1316876	Love is dreaminess.
1324483	1325784	And I love the video.
1325804	1327366	The video is so freaking adorable.
1328367	1330328	It almost makes the song a little guy with little arms.
1331550	1332951	Look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.
1334446	1342359	Bitmania, Reign of Sorrow, Brilliant 2, OG Mix, and Love is Dreaminess.
1342580	1343661	Shane, what did you pick for number two?
1345288	1348289	I picked, sorry, I picked, what did I pick?
1348749	1356991	Right on Time from Guitar Freak's Drum Mania because that was like the first Drum Mania song I ever played.
1357091	1359351	And it was like so freaking good.
1359431	1361312	Yeah, it's just the constant having it.
1361332	1361872	It's so good.
1361892	1364072	I didn't even do the chorus.
1364132	1364452	I hate it.
1369844	1370144	Better?
1371045	1378249	Well, what I was telling Shane is that I called the song The Arm Breaker when I got good enough at Drum Mania to play this one in the intermediate.
1378789	1382491	It was, yeah.
1383611	1389054	It was all the drumming that was all on the left side, and then you had to hit your cymbal really on the little splash part.
1389615	1390835	All right.
1391015	1391996	Andrew, your number two pick.
1393176	1395738	My number two pick is Caution.
1398462	1399243	Now why this one?
1399283	1401086	This is like from old school.
1402348	1409338	Well, it ought to be obvious that I used to follow DDR freestyle and nothing reminds me of DDR freestyle like 18 style.
1409458	1412102	And you have the classic cocky drop.
1421418	1425979	Can you describe what a caution drop is for those that weren't listening to our show when we were doing DDR stuff?
1426039	1430080	Alright, a caution drop is one of the classic DDR freestyle moves.
1431441	1438623	Basically, the freestyler hops onto up and right and then drops back onto their hands onto down and left.
1439023	1442144	So they just kind of slam back down onto the pad.
1443185	1446686	It's cool when it's done right, but it can hurt you a lot if you do it wrong.
1447964	1457943	Alright, Caution, also known as, I can probably not pronounce this, Wongo, Yongo, or Don't Bother Me, because that's what it was called in Pump It Up, because it's a better game.
1459719	1460799	Alright, there you have it.
1461740	1465541	Alright, so Loki, what was your... I'm getting all mixed up here.
1466582	1467962	Trying to juggle like five different screens here.
1467982	1469283	Loki, what was your number two pick?
1469363	1473885	My number two pick was Era, the nostril mix or whatever it is.
1474165	1474685	Nostril?
1474705	1477226	The nostril mix.
1477326	1478567	No, it wasn't nostril.
1480788	1482068	Because it was just a cool song.
1482268	1482889	And it's a tack.
1483829	1485550	And our live listeners heard this during the break tonight.
1485950	1486170	Yes.
1487390	1488711	So, I don't know.
1490060	1490800	Alright, there you have it.
1490880	1491741	Era, the NostalMix.
1491761	1493101	Remember, you guys and Jack get to vote.
1493141	1497902	Actually, I think it was one of the first songs that had the speed change in DDR4thMix, I want to say.
1498923	1499123	Yeah.
1499143	1500623	Alright.
1501043	1507986	Well, unless you consider, was it... Absolute.
1508006	1509126	No, that was 5thMix.
1509326	1509926	I was thinking... .59.
1512947	1514908	No, .59 was also 4th.
1515388	1518749	There is that love... Whatever, I'll remember it from 3rdMix.
1518989	1519169	Anyways...
1520382	1520963	Love this feeling?
1521483	1522344	Yes, love this feeling.
1522364	1523605	That has to be changed.
1523685	1526207	I have a funny story about this song.
1526427	1527668	Go ahead.
1528769	1532652	I scared Dan one time.
1532933	1537276	I don't know if he remembers this, but the first time I ever beat that song in 7 key, I screamed.
1538197	1541320	Because I had been trying for like an hour, doing nothing but playing that song.
1542361	1543221	And he's like, what's wrong?
1543702	1548166	I beat era O. And he went back to doing what he was doing.
1552532	1564700	so that's it alright so that's why I like sorry I was turning on the lights in the studio I can't leave this computer chair for like two seconds alright DarkSakura what would your number two pick be?
1565321	1580991	my number two pick is Dancer from Beatmania 8th Style Beatmania 2DX 8th Style that's not the Beatmania version yeah it is Devon this is it
1582230	1582950	This is the middle of it.
1588852	1592774	There's an album version of it.
1593494	1594194	Oh, gotcha.
1594614	1602077	But no, I like that song because you just have people dancing in the background and doing the stupid arm-waving pose and holding up a doll.
1602537	1605378	The video was the greatest 2DX video they ever made, period.
1605458	1607358	I don't think they made a better video than Dancer.
1608539	1608819	All right.
1610739	1636855	Uh, so Dancer is Jamie's number two pick, okay, my number two pick, I gotta preface this, you're gonna hate my number two pick, and I don't care, screw you, because honestly, it's my list of top three, and honestly, I can say this with all honesty, if it were not for this song, or more specifically, this band, I would not have, like, been all, like, gaga over Japanese DDR as I was, like, this song, this song, or this band, was an enabler to me for DDR.
1637095	1637235	Uh-oh.
1638387	1644569	and that's why my number two pick is Erotic with Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.
1658595	1660417	Oh Nick, please not so quick, my number two pick.
1660958	1664262	Alright, yes, with the crappy rapping and everything, you just gotta love it so bad.
1664682	1668347	Alright, now we get to the number one picks, right?
1668387	1671270	We have a list of ten, so let's add the number ones.
1672191	1676657	Shane Miklatov, what is your number one favorite Bomani song of all time?
1677608	1700118	My number one favorite Beemani song of all time would be Boom Boom Dollar from DDR because it is the first DDR song I ever heard and the lyrics cracked me up because I didn't know what was going on because I just heard it on like an internet radio thing I used to listen to and so I thought the premise of DDR was you had to hit the arrows for more time because it said pushing all the buttons
1700638	1701259	More time.
1701939	1704961	And now I understand it's kind of true because if you don't hit the arrows, you die.
1705421	1707023	But it's not the way I thought.
1707343	1709144	And I love this song so much.
1709344	1709665	Nice.
1709825	1710405	There you have it.
1710445	1711306	Boom Boom Dollar.
1712386	1714588	Mikko Top's number one favorite Bomani song of all time.
1714908	1719732	Drew, what is your number one most favoritest Bomani song of all time?
1719772	1721593	It was so hard to pick.
1721633	1724035	And I know I'm going to piss off the other old school people.
1724855	1728278	But I have to say my number one is Zephyr.
1733543	1734884	This song is great.
1734964	1736025	It's epic.
1736045	1740927	The video, the vocals, the strings, the difficulty.
1742728	1743729	It's a hell of a song.
1745590	1747191	This song is pretty fucking epic.
1747471	1748132	I will say that.
1748152	1750093	It just screams epic.
1750953	1753775	This is the song that you imagine Itagaki burning things to.
1757372	1762336	Alright, Loki, your number one favorite Bomani song of all time.
1762376	1771084	This is probably one of the first songs I ever played, and I have to say, out of all the songs I've played in DDR, I'd say I've probably played this song the most.
1773686	1778050	And it's been in, I would say, probably the most DDR mixes possible.
1779611	1780292	Dynamite Rave.
1792995	1795317	You know, Dynamite Rave is one of those songs that age well.
1795337	1798939	Because I remember in the beginning of this show, we used to make fun of this song all the freaking time.
1798959	1801301	Because we were just so annoyed by it, how it showed up everywhere.
1801621	1805324	But looking back like six years now, this song was actually pretty fun.
1805384	1807265	Drop E and hump the coin return.
1809372	1812633	DarkSakura, your number one favorite Bomani song of all freaking time.
1838607	1843889	I would have to say that I'm going to go with Heaven is a 57 Metallic Grey just because it's so fun.
1844690	1852213	Isn't that fun?
1854194	1858055	Although I think it was funny what the original name was supposed to be.
1858095	1859336	Heaven is a 57 Chevrolet?
1859356	1859756	Yeah.
1860636	1864018	I think they didn't want the... They couldn't get licensing on it.
1867896	1869938	I like it in dance.
1869958	1874201	The reason why I like it in Dance Maniacs is because you do the whole knee scroll and everything.
1874882	1881367	It has you doing stuff that requires lower body and upper body so it actually looks a bit more like you're dancing with it.
1882108	1883369	And it's very swingy.
1883409	1884249	I think it's fun.
1886171	1886411	And it's
1887796	1890877	Dance Maniacs is kind of the forgotten Bomani game, sadly, too.
1891198	1893359	Table Waxing Revolution.
1895620	1897701	That and Keyboard Mania are off in a corner crying.
1897721	1900082	It's all about Dance Maniacs second.
1901442	1904624	Dance Maniacs in marathon mode center.
1906225	1907985	That's happy right there.
1908506	1908846	All right.
1910106	1912608	That just leaves me one more song for the list.
1912788	1913709	And no one cares, so bye.
1914009	1914890	I'm kidding.
1916471	1916891	What?
1917252	1917532	Heart.
1917912	1918152	Okay.
1919173	1932183	And this song, my number one favorite, is also kind of an enabler of sorts because, honestly, I found a whole lot of new music because of the game this was in and because of this mix and everything.
1932584	1938028	Yeah, this song is just my most favorite Bomani song ever, and it's Skulk by Echo Image.
1952719	1954561	There it is, Skulk.
1955582	1959106	Alright, so that leaves the list right now as this.
1959566	1963370	And while I read the list, I'm curious, chat room, what did we forget?
1963911	1965793	We're going to get a whole lot of that.
1965853	1967034	I was almost going to put in it.
1967414	1968175	What did we forget?
1968195	1970638	Yeah, what songs almost made it for you guys?
1971501	1978303	Stuff that almost made it in for me was Gatchamanota from Poppin' Music and Lupin the Third.
1979464	1988907	And the one that I was really fighting over, though, was Twinbee and the Gradius Full Speed.
1989147	1990667	It's hard to have just three, isn't it?
1990847	1995389	It is, but I had to really think of the ones that I thought were a bit more pivotal to me, so...
1995749	1995989	Right.
1996650	2006976	For me, I would say songs that were so close yet so far for me, probably, and now I'm driving light, V35, Flotation, although nobody likes that song.
2007056	2009318	Shut up, I hate you, Thunder from 2DXA Style.
2009338	2010058	Flotation was good, shut up.
2010879	2014761	They're like all 2DX songs after those 2DDR songs I have.
2015162	2016442	Miklatov, what was close for you?
2016743	2021486	I had Rockbeat and Wanda down for my four and five just in case my other three got taken.
2022992	2030556	but I also just realized I really should have put such a feeling or not such a feeling what is it called?
2031336	2048244	one from DDR Hottest Party because it really brought back the feeling of DDR for me just the way it sounds it's by Yuichi so it's pretty good I was just going to say I didn't put love in there which was like my song on repeat for a long time
2048504	2052967	We're getting lots of people in chat saying how could we not have Captain Jack on the list.
2053488	2055049	Not a one of us named Captain Jack.
2055649	2057190	Shane says it's because he's dead.
2057831	2058451	It's not that.
2058511	2058871	I don't know.
2058931	2059432	You know what?
2059572	2061013	I have a CD.
2061353	2062554	The songs were catchy.
2062714	2063775	They just weren't my favorite.
2065156	2066157	All of Captain Jack's stuff is on iTunes.
2066477	2068398	I agree with Charlie Nash says Moonlight Shadow.
2068638	2069299	I love that song.
2069319	2069699	That's a good one.
2070119	2072001	Ghosts in Ordinary... Not Ordinary World.
2072021	2072461	That's okay.
2072541	2075103	Ghosts in Drifting Away for me.
2075123	2075743	Loki?
2076264	2076464	Loki?
2078386	2082670	I liked, was it Fantasy from Max 2?
2084611	2087134	No, no, not the Eurobeat one, the other Fantasy.
2087154	2089396	The one that was in 2DX4, right?
2089576	2091257	No, no, not that one.
2091317	2092899	The one that was only in Max 2.
2093339	2094400	Too many songs named Fantasy.
2094660	2095701	Yeah, it was cool.
2096262	2102547	And then also, I would say probably, because we can't forget about Guitar Freaks, Fire.
2102668	2102948	Fire.
2107520	2112183	End of the Century, Frisbee says DXY, Holic, Face, Drew,
2130215	2132676	There were so many that I'd forgotten at the last minute.
2132696	2134236	I wanted to change my mind on the number one.
2134816	2144058	My backups were Legend of Max, Murmur Twins, Jack and Mark Get Busy, and what was going to be my number one at the last minute.
2144118	2145978	I'm like, oh crap, he's going to do it anyway.
2146638	2148058	LED, Something Wonderful.
2148638	2152459	I have to offer the suggestions that Sauce gave me.
2152479	2157380	It was Boom Boom Dollar and El Ritmo Tropical, even though we put Boom Boom Dollar in there.
2159450	2164020	Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on Sunday Nights on All Games, says what?
2164100	2164681	No Linus?
2165042	2165803	I like that song.
2165943	2166685	That sounds pretty cool.
2166905	2167366	It's hard.
2167947	2168208	All right.
2168931	2169732	and Cheer Train.
2170712	2171312	No, no, no, no, no.
2171413	2176195	What was the one that had the stick figures doing the Hadouken with the heart in the video?
2176215	2176756	I don't remember.
2177296	2179517	I love that song and I can't remember the name of it.
2179897	2184740	We have a very difficult task ahead of us now and that is we have to reduce this list to 15 to 10.
2185040	2186181	This is going to be painful.
2186621	2188122	No one take it personally, alright?
2188142	2188823	It's just a game.
2189864	2191865	Alright, here we go.
2193465	2194865	Here's the list as it stands so far.
2194945	2208629	Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Reign of Sorrow, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Caution, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Boom Boom Dollars, Zephyr, Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.
2209309	2211970	Miklatov, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2213720	2214820	What's the list again?
2238820	2240261	Boom Boom Dollar is off the list.
2240381	2241122	Oh, snap.
2241382	2242022	Oh, snap.
2242563	2243684	But it's on.
2243844	2245085	It is on.
2247606	2249788	Boom Boom Dollar has been stricken from the list.
2249808	2251950	I think that he just did that so that Shane would go pout.
2252050	2253731	As Miklatov runs off to pout.
2254852	2256933	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2259415	2263178	You know, I just don't like Zephyr.
2266280	2266861	Zephyr.
2268129	2269129	is off the list.
2271510	2272110	Now we're down to 12.
2272790	2275090	DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
2276971	2286932	I am going to go with... Yeah, but it's Bitmania, isn't it?
2288352	2289393	Bitmania stays in.
2289433	2290533	Yeah, Bitmania has to stay.
2290573	2291033	I'm sorry.
2294493	2297314	Shane is trying to conspire to get Drew's final song off the list.
2298448	2305393	I am... Will you buy me a chocolate?
2306714	2306914	No.
2307154	2307975	I'm not taking bribes.
2309476	2311057	I'm gonna say Reign of Sorrow.
2312358	2315040	Rain of Sorrow has been stricken from the list.
2316341	2318042	Gosh, that was the one I was going to take.
2319083	2329811	So we have Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.
2330451	2332553	I can't believe Erotic survived that round.
2336116	2337416	Oh god, this is hard.
2337477	2338878	I actually like all these songs.
2339318	2340659	I really like all these songs.
2347848	2349650	Um, I don't know.
2353635	2355778	I'm gonna, oh god, I hate to do this.
2355858	2357059	I'm gonna take out Dynamite Rave.
2357280	2357880	Sorry, Loki.
2359282	2362746	It just was staring me a sore thumb like, you don't really like this song, Rob.
2364702	2367743	Alright, so we are left with 10, a list of 10.
2368183	2368664	Here it is.
2369424	2383189	Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era Nostal Mix, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Heaven is a 57 Metallic Grey, and Skulk.
2383209	2384950	Alright.
2384970	2385270	Alright.
2387205	2405243	So there it is in the chat room, and if you would send me a private message in chat, those of you that are listening live tonight, with your number one and your number two picks, make sure it's clearly listed, or I will assume the first one is your number one pick, and we will reveal the results of the definitive top three Bomani songs ever.
2405543	2409467	And help me try to remember what the hell that song was to that video while you're at it.
2410524	2413906	It had the stick figure doing the heart hadoken.
2414726	2415266	I don't remember.
2415306	2416787	I love that song and I couldn't remember it.
2416867	2417387	I'm sorry.
2418408	2420669	Alright, well we'll get back to some gaming news in the meantime.
2421329	2422810	And DarkSakura's gonna start us off.
2422970	2423851	Oh, do I gotta?
2423891	2424331	You gotta.
2424351	2425471	This is bugging me now.
2426372	2426732	Rob.
2427492	2427953	What?
2428853	2429313	Nom.
2430214	2431534	Nom nom nom nom nom nom.
2431654	2432555	You're hungry or what?
2433155	2434576	No, it has to do with Nintendo.
2435456	2438498	Nintendo has filed a trademark in Japan that's called Nom.
2438518	2438578	Nom.
2439372	2440014	Nomnomnom.
2440094	2441537	Nintendo Online Magazine.
2441758	2442540	N-O-M.
2444063	2447812	And, um... It is, uh...
2450746	2455707	I really, I guess I don't know what to say about, you know, anything other than a Nintendo online magazine.
2457168	2467790	Maybe it's going to be like, well, you know, Nintendo already publishes a regular magazine in Japan and we haven't, I think, is Nintendo Power still in publication?
2467850	2468090	Yeah.
2468850	2472051	So maybe this is just going to be condensed versions of them online?
2473452	2479093	You know, like, I guess, doesn't EGM have their online site now and all these other places do?
2479213	2479373	So...
2481963	2482844	I miss GamePro.
2484124	2485125	Because I like pro tips.
2485145	2488947	I miss GamePro.
2490088	2491108	I miss GamePro TV.
2492269	2499813	Well, people were saddened earlier this week when there was a brand new Wii update to the Wii menu.
2500354	2509959	Update 3.3, which nullified the Twilight Princess hack and allowed you also to do something with your Miis and the Mii Parade and that kind of thing.
2510740	2511020	Well...
2512566	2515667	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2534435	2552182	It altered the name of Apuna and allowed basically hackers to change the name and so the game was looking for a certain name and it was too large for what it was supposed to be and it caused it to crash and then they ran their own code on top of that.
2552963	2553743	Ah, I see.
2553943	2559186	It didn't affect people that already had the homebrew channel installed in their system, but now it doesn't even matter anymore.
2559266	2566030	So if you're still interested in homebrew or other things, the brand new Twilight hack has been released.
2566110	2567290	So enjoy.
2569292	2569552	Hmm.
2571433	2576235	Do you think this is going to become an ongoing battle like Sony versus their homebrew people?
2576496	2577136	Yes, I do.
2578437	2578737	All right.
2579137	2579877	Yes, I do.
2580418	2580718	All right.
2582099	2583320	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2603331	2605572	without even copying them over first.
2605832	2610853	Meaning that download content will be available to save on an SD card.
2610973	2613474	Thank you, somebody, for figuring this out.
2613994	2615975	And it just proves it's possible.
2617015	2619996	And Nintendo just needs to patch their dang system already to make this happen.
2620856	2622577	I'm surprised Rock Band didn't do it first.
2624157	2630219	But with, you know, Rock Band coming out for Wii and all the downloadable content that could be there, but isn't.
2630999	2631239	Yeah.
2632700	2632980	All right.
2633567	2641190	Well, that'll be kind of cool, and I'm happy to see that the Wii will get to participate in that download content, so I'm kind of curious how they're going to incorporate that into the store-thor.
2641450	2642431	The store-thor?
2642791	2643411	The store-tho.
2643431	2645072	That should be interesting.
2646243	2647604	I'm still mad that no one spelled me the name of that song.
2647644	2647764	Sorry.
2673942	2677285	First email comes from Spazinator.
2678066	2679147	Hi, everyone.
2679207	2682650	It's called Quick Question, but the letter really is anything but, so I'm still going to read it.
2683431	2684172	Hi, everyone.
2684892	2690037	I'm hoping to get your input on an ongoing debate that I'm having with someone.
2690457	2694221	The debate is whether or not any online interaction people...
2695502	2699447	First of all, most of this person's E's in the first paragraphs are R's, so it's really bizarre.
2700508	2711040	If any online interactions people have had with each other, whether it be MMOs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI or any other online game for that matter, constitute socializing.
2713935	2741472	My line of thought is that these online interactions is indeed socializing I categorize socializing as the interaction between two or more people for non-business aka fun purposes regardless of the medium involved whether it be in person, online, or whatever as long as person A interacts with person B and vice versa and it's non-business related, it's socializing the only limiting factor in online socializing is that you cannot as of yet beat the living snot out of some other people nor can you have sex with them
2741792	2743041	We're working on that, I'm sure.
2743886	2744873	On both counts.
2746267	2749308	For those two things, you have to have that in person.
2749948	2751809	Is this to say that one is better than the other?
2751909	2752549	I don't think so.
2752669	2756691	In some cases, in-person socializing is not feasible due to distance and whatnot.
2757171	2768815	How many people are really going to travel hundreds if not thousands of miles to socialize and play games with another person when online will suffice, especially with these high as hell gas prices?
2769236	2770456	What is your take on this issue?
2772677	2774818	I actually do agree that it is socializing...
2775698	2777399	A community is a community.
2778340	2783923	You know, I've gone on, back in the days when I played, you know, shit, what was that game?
2784303	2786225	Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.
2787005	2787745	We had our groups.
2787785	2790927	We were hanging out and chatting about crap while we busted the crap out of things.
2791688	2795370	You know, I hang out with people on Ragnarok.
2795470	2797231	I hang out with a lot of people online.
2797832	2801614	It's really just another medium of communication.
2802054	2816501	Wow for me is especially that World of Warcraft for me is especially like that because you know we go around you know we're doing our thing in Warcraft but I'm having more fun just chatting on Ventrilo and all the crazy antics that happen on there you know talking to people all right it's like a party chat I'm gonna have to make the distinction here
2819083	2830574	Talking to other people on a global game scale, like say on your server in WoW or in Final Fantasy, that's not socializing.
2831495	2832215	You're just there.
2832936	2840343	When you get down to the guild level or the IRC channel level, stuff like that, the guild, the party, the channel, whatever it is,
2841309	2846251	That would probably be a social community, albeit not a very personal one at first.
2847051	2853414	But that would be how you define community, as in your smaller guilds, not your entire server.
2854294	2859896	But other than that, yeah, I think it's a perfectly viable form of socializing.
2860657	2862597	I have to quote something that Sauce just told me.
2863438	2866939	Some people spend hours talking on the phone, other people spend hours talking in IM.
2867039	2867559	Same difference.
2868500	2868740	True.
2869200	2869380	True.
2870484	2875526	What's... Especially with a lot of long-distance friendships that technology have allowed us to build.
2876166	2881327	Back in the day, it was very hard to have... You'd have a pen pal in a faraway place, and that was pretty much it.
2882008	2887549	But thanks to the internet, you can talk to somebody in a whole other country as easily.
2887589	2888430	I mean, look at our show.
2888490	2889970	We have people calling us from other countries.
2889990	2892651	It doesn't cost them anything, thanks to Skype.
2893251	2898072	All my family, a lot of my friends, are all over the country, and this is how I keep in touch with them.
2898753	2899473	And I think that...
2901036	2904617	In fact, hold on, somebody else... Okay, she said, okay, fine.
2905297	2906357	Sorry for misquoting you.
2906377	2908318	She said diff, not difference, whatever.
2908758	2911678	I'm going to look up something, though, so somebody else add to that.
2913219	2920740	Well, I was just going to say real quick that we've joked plenty of times, or at least I've said this, is that World of Warcraft is just a chat room with a fireball spell.
2921560	2923661	A very bad chat room.
2924121	2925941	No, it's a great game.
2926001	2928502	Again, on the guild level, it's a very good chat room.
2929375	2931276	In Baron's chat, it's a very bad chat room.
2931296	2933176	You just turn off Baron's chat.
2933416	2933936	That's what I do.
2934637	2935917	Trade chat.
2936137	2937097	I shouldn't have to.
2937117	2939038	Trade chat is the new Baron's chat, by the way.
2939118	2940558	I shouldn't have to.
2940798	2948081	Going to dictionary.com, which I love, especially for my stupid nutrition class with my really anal teacher.
2949901	2961423	Socialize is defined as taking part in social activities, interacting with others, or to train for a social environment, to prepare for social life, or to conform to... Oh, that's socialism, sorry.
2961984	2966244	But another one listed on here is to associate or mingle sociably with others.
2966985	2972886	It does not say anywhere in any of these dozens of definitions to physically interact.
2973766	2974706	That's called punching.
2975607	2976547	Or boinking.
2977507	2978027	Or slapping.
2978147	2978447	Nice.
2979508	2980388	Or staring at them.
2981108	2981468	Bonk.
2982348	2988870	So by the dictionary, there is no requirement to be in person to socialize.
2989130	2992151	I believe Nintendo Maniac 64 rejects your analysis.
2992991	2995432	He says, bah, dictionary.com.
2995492	2996692	It's all about the wictionary now.
2997493	2998093	I'm just kidding.
3000173	3000953	WTF ever.
3001253	3002774	Yeah, Urban Dictionary is the best.
3003495	3004776	That's a big freaking whatever.
3005016	3007538	I name all my WoW characters off of Urban Dictionary.
3007738	3008038	You do?
3008378	3008618	Yes.
3008698	3009119	Like what?
3010220	3012161	Well, my main character is called Sassy Pants.
3012821	3013782	You know what I still remember?
3013982	3014182	What?
3014743	3015163	Lil' Kim.
3016224	3017725	Yeah, Lil' Kim was my Final Fantasy XI character.
3017745	3019146	Final Fantasy XI.
3019226	3022548	No, my newest one I just rolled the other night is Drama Llama.
3024349	3026591	A girl who spits out her drama everywhere like a llama.
3026611	3026751	Yeah.
3027136	3027937	I know people like that.
3028437	3036382	So to conclude this letter, also, if I may, I would like to give a quick shout out to some people that I didn't get a chance to when I called in last week.
3037023	3042146	Hello to everyone in the Limit Break Radio link shell on the Odin server on Final Fantasy XI.
3043367	3045929	I played on that server for five seconds.
3046769	3055235	And everyone in the Happy Haven link shell on the Alexander server on Final Fantasy XI, especially Digby Reloaded, Jaden, Brina, and Reku.
3055375	3056216	Thanks in advance.
3057262	3058544	Oh, memories of Final Fantasy XI.
3058584	3063910	You know, it's too bad Minklatov ran off to pout because this would be the part where I might say he's trying to get me to play again.
3064271	3064951	I told him no.
3065111	3065672	I just can't.
3066253	3067855	Thinking of playing again makes me want to vomit.
3068335	3068796	I can't.
3068836	3069777	Call of Tarku compels you.
3070077	3070538	I can't.
3071919	3073722	No disrespect to those still playing.
3073762	3074903	I just, I can't.
3075143	3076044	I'm already playing a good game.
3076365	3077346	It's like a bad breakup.
3079990	3087659	To go on with the next email, and this is coming from Robert M. Glad to see you're all doing well, shifting without a clutch.
3088500	3099451	From what I've heard from the press releases for the upcoming Guitar Hero World Tour, aka GH4, it will indeed allow you to store purchased and downloaded songs onto your SD cards.
3099491	3100533	Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.
3101433	3104194	Here's to hoping more developers are able to do that.
3104595	3107676	I've also been working quite a bit on Space Invaders Extreme.
3107836	3110617	Hard to say which invaders are more annoying in multiplayer.
3110998	3114799	The Mirror Shields, Reflect Types Officially, or the ISBs, Assault Types.
3115880	3120162	This email was brought to you by Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix, Home of the Neverending Story.
3121062	3121322	Nice.
3121742	3122483	That's the best.
3123183	3129465	By the way, when I was talking about Space Invaders Extreme in Part A, I have yet to play multiplayer because I have no friends with the game.
3130866	3132706	Except for Loki, but he'll probably never play it with me.
3132806	3133767	Poor Rob.
3133807	3134407	Poor me.
3134427	3142510	Well, this email, this next one comes from someone familiar and near and dear to all of us who stayed with me at Faname last year.
3142750	3142990	Who?
3143450	3144590	It's from Kimera.
3144610	3145791	Ah, yes.
3145831	3146031	Yes.
3147071	3150173	Hey guys, unfortunately I haven't been able to listen to the episodes lately.
3150233	3151494	Something wrong with podcasts.
3151954	3155837	Anyway, I just wanted to congratulate you all on six years of pure, unadulterated awesome.
3156157	3157378	Here's to six more years.
3157498	3159319	Take care, and I think of you every Sunday.
3160120	3161280	Yay, thank you.
3161320	3161641	Thank you.
3161861	3162461	We miss you.
3162681	3163642	Come back and visit soon.
3164923	3166284	And one from Hippolytus.
3168337	3168938	Some thoughts.
3169738	3172140	First, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, yes, you are all geeks.
3172160	3176463	You spent ten minutes talking about D&D and then complained that somebody rightly calls you a geek, as if.
3176884	3180426	No, what we complained about was him using geek as a derogatory.
3181047	3188293	So, which actually we very much specified several times over in the last episode.
3188333	3189454	So, as if...
3190894	3208143	I realize we left ourselves wide open for a crack like that, but really what we were saying was not that we had a problem with the fact that he called us a geek, but just the fact that he was being so derogatory about it when it is a flaw of the Nintendo Wii.
3208243	3209464	So, SDFU, sit down.
3210908	3212409	Not you, the guy at Nintendo.
3212429	3214611	Second, updates on Saturday, really?
3215731	3215932	Okay.
3216512	3217913	Third, Patti LuPone.
3218674	3221335	Dude, it's all about Bernadette Peters if you don't have Ethel Merman.
3224998	3227039	I think it's criticizing my musical choices.
3227079	3229121	Look, I just pulled one up in iTunes, okay?
3230622	3231843	Bernadette Peters was awesome.
3231863	3233104	She used to be on The Muppet Show all the time.
3235000	3237861	I'm sorry, I actually really, really dig Bernadette Peters.
3239202	3240242	Okay, fourth.
3240442	3242643	Import can't decide what to eat now.
3243644	3244044	Thank you.
3244424	3245004	Mini review.
3245124	3247345	It's a cookbook for the DS published by Nintendo.
3247786	3253268	You can choose a recipe based on ingredient, source country, difficulty, cooking method, calories, or cooking time.
3253668	3259051	It will create a shopping list for you, and since the DS is so portable, you can take it to the market with you.
3259291	3261972	I saw that coming out, and I actually was very interested in
3262572	3263112	I want this.
3263132	3265153	Acquiring that from IP or DS.
3265554	3267555	To continue, awesome features.
3267915	3271677	The recipe will read aloud all the steps to you so you don't have to look at the DS.
3271717	3274819	You can go forward and backward in the recipe with the voice controls.
3274899	3276560	Continue, go back, more info.
3276860	3286525	Really, the only thing that's missing is that, remember how they had that DS cookbook that came out in Japan that had a little thing that plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot that was a magnet so you could stick it to your fridge while you cook?
3288026	3288546	That's pretty cool.
3289246	3290627	But just to conclude the email...
3293587	3301150	In addition to the wonderful photos and full voiceover, there are also videos, yes, a return of full motion video, to demonstrate difficult concepts or techniques.
3301230	3305472	In short, this game probably would be a mascot game for Orange Lounge Foodio.
3306392	3311895	This message is brought to you by Y Kitchen, home of the best Nintendo DS inspired food.
3314456	3315336	I'm getting this game.
3315876	3316997	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
3317117	3318037	I'm getting this game.
3318617	3319097	No, no, no, no.
3319117	3319338	Get it.
3319398	3320218	It's already been gotten.
3321559	3326641	But no, I've been major food whore lately, as in cooking everything.
3326741	3328381	I made the best beef stew, okay?
3328561	3330522	No, someone on this show a fan of food?
3331482	3333843	But I mean, I've been cooking a whole lot lately.
3334603	3336424	And my beef stew is stupendous.
3336524	3337004	This is true.
3337064	3340225	She was talking to me about her beef stew for like five minutes before the show started.
3341085	3341625	Doesn't that sound good?
3341645	3343426	But she's going to make me some, so I'm okay with it.
3343446	3344446	Well, I'm going to bring you some.
3344606	3345347	I've got tons of it.
3345407	3345627	Woohoo!
3347592	3350857	Apparently, Junami wants to come over to my house and have beef stew.
3351778	3352099	Beefs.
3353120	3353661	More email.
3354322	3354963	Moss email.
3355063	3355704	Do I gotta?
3356400	3357281	Unless there's no more left.
3357421	3357881	There's two more.
3358561	3367748	So I heard you guys mention that this alleged Kenyan should fly the Kenyan flag outside of the Kenyan building in Kenya and throw a gang sign up or something.
3368108	3369649	An OLR gang sign or something.
3369889	3372030	So I thought he might need a little inspiration.
3372771	3376433	And the guy sent us pictures of him doing a weird OLR-inspired gang sign.
3376493	3377434	Which was awesome.
3378014	3378355	I know.
3378435	3378955	It's pretty cool.
3378995	3382618	But no, we don't want him to fly the Kenyan... What was Rob wanting to fly the Kenyan flag?
3383038	3386200	I just wanted a picture in front of that Samara Cafe so I could see how shitty it is.
3387841	3391123	But will you link those pictures in chat so everybody can learn the OLR gang signs?
3391483	3393324	I will, and this came from ParadoxVincent.
3393404	3397287	Even though we're spreading ParadoxVincent's mug all over our chat room, I'm sure he won't mind.
3398247	3400389	All pictures you send us become our property, so nah.
3403250	3404991	By our property, we mean everybody's property.
3405251	3405592	That's right.
3406612	3407553	It's on the internet!
3408995	3411035	DarkSakura is currently posting those links in chat.
3411435	3415536	For those of you guys not in chat, well, I guess that's incentive to join us next time.
3415576	3416756	Maybe we'll post this on the forums after the show.
3416776	3418117	We are not Orange Chicken Radio.
3419517	3420297	We're not?
3420317	3422157	Joshy16 says we're Orange Chicken Radio.
3422878	3425198	But I love Orange... I almost had Orange Chicken for dinner last night.
3425878	3426778	Oh, it's Cheesecake Factory.
3426798	3430619	By the way, for those in the studio, and also, there's the OLR gang sign right there.
3431819	3433119	Pretty nice for those in the studio.
3433399	3434400	Last email!
3434540	3436000	Dun-dun-dun from Dwayne.
3437742	3438843	Hello, love the show.
3439243	3448987	With the release of Syphon Filter 3 and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror on the PlayStation Network, what are the chances that Sony will release a PS3 version of Syphon Filter, the most underrated action game ever?
3449868	3454590	Also having a PS make my home the playhouse for my nieces and nephews.
3455390	3459614	I would love to get a Guitar Hero rock band game for them to team up on.
3459954	3467640	But the problem is, well, let's just say we are an urban family not trying to hear Metallica, Def Leppard, or Aerosmith unless it's with Run DMC.
3468240	3471403	More into Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, and Jay-Z.
3472424	3475326	Heck, I will take some old Prince, Michael Jackson, or Marvin Gaye.
3475346	3477808	What are the chances of getting an R&B band or DJ Hero?
3478349	3478969	Thanks, Dwayne.
3479009	3479249	P.S.
3479289	3480670	Can I get a fuck you to gas prices?
3480851	3483593	Well, last I heard, they were working on DJ Hero, so...
3485615	3486816	A Matter of Time, I guess.
3488037	3488517	Eventually.
3489998	3496203	You can always buy Beatmania 2DX, which did come out on PlayStation 2.
3496923	3499145	I would love a home version of Kraken DJ so bad.
3499185	3502507	I'm sorry, didn't MTV try a game like that and fail horribly?
3506070	3509112	Personally, I think that they're great because I have Radiohead.
3510813	3512334	I freaking love Radiohead.
3512354	3513395	The only thing it needs is Blur.
3515180	3515520	Hi!
3516441	3516801	Alright.
3516821	3518943	Is that it for email?
3519643	3523065	Yeah, but speaking of blur, I was watching some band on the Graham Norton show yesterday.
3523085	3526227	It's the first time I've ever actually watched any significant amount of this show.
3527128	3532391	And I didn't know who they were, but some guy was playing the keyboard and I was like, this is a bad blur impersonation.
3533612	3542198	Well, if you want to send us emails and get Jamie all nostalgic for her favorite bands, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails to.
3543925	3551072	Meanwhile, we're one story away from tonight's listless results and the revival of another favorite Orange Lounge radio segment.
3551932	3554395	Listless results on the way right after one more story.
3554455	3554715	Loki.
3555154	3564298	Yes, in case you're really, really, really lonely or just need something to hump, I guess, Sega has created a robotic girlfriend for you.
3565478	3570720	Her name, I guess, is Emma, or Eternal Maiden Actualization.
3571641	3576963	And she is... She looks like an Ivo.
3577003	3578303	Yes, she looks like an Ivo.
3578323	3579984	She looks like an Ivo.
3580964	3583746	And she stands, I guess...
3585912	3586552	18 inches tall.
3586652	3589473	She can sing, dance, and totally make out with you.
3589993	3593853	I guess there is a love mode where she'll hug you and kiss nearby humans.
3595514	3595954	Wow.
3596074	3597554	She looks like an eyeball.
3598434	3600335	That's great.
3600455	3604935	It's apparently 18,000 yen or $166 US if you're actually interested in this.
3604995	3608236	And it's coming out in September in Japan only.
3609476	3611156	So you gotta import them, girlfriends.
3612517	3614297	So what, do we call her EE for short?
3616007	3616227	Emma.
3617107	3617328	Mm-hmm.
3617828	3617908	E-E.
3617968	3618088	E-E.
3618648	3618828	Okay.
3619948	3620209	All right.
3621069	3622489	She looks like a freaking AIBO, though.
3622690	3622990	Whoosh.
3626031	3626271	Nice.
3627491	3627611	Whoosh.
3627631	3627811	Whatever.
3628031	3630032	What's the name of the cooking game that was brought up earlier?
3630052	3631073	A couple people have been asking.
3633434	3634754	Okay, I have to pull the email back up.
3634774	3635214	It's Cooking Guy.
3635254	3636295	Can't decide what to eat.
3637435	3637695	All right.
3637935	3639536	DarkSakura will get on that later.
3640156	3643157	But for now, we're going to reveal who won tonight's list list.
3644358	3644618	Hooray.
3644678	3645178	Hooray.
3647759	3651860	The top three songs, the definitive list of the best Bomani songs of all time.
3651900	3654500	Not that there was any controversy in this process at all.
3655361	3657621	However, it's time to reveal the list.
3657761	3662202	Your number three pick was Bitmania.
3669743	3670784	Was your number three pick.
3670824	3677325	Your number two pick, and this kind of surprised me, was Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.
3686416	3702584	And the number one best Bomani song of all freaking time as voted by you, our chatroom based on our list here in studio was Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove Up
3711857	3714538	Which kind of fits that a Naoki song should take the title.
3715098	3715779	Well, there you have it.
3716279	3717219	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3717399	3719640	Our not controversial at all list.
3720821	3721221	All right.
3721481	3724002	Skulk, one point away from being on that list.
3724122	3726523	And lots of them tied there in the back, too.
3726763	3728944	Okay, I have a bone to pick with Skulk.
3729144	3729964	Uh-oh, what's that?
3730365	3731525	It makes me drive too fast.
3732806	3733566	There's nothing wrong with that.
3735876	3736196	All right.
3736997	3744362	Well, it's time for the Skype line where you can give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3744582	3748805	But tonight we have a little twist on the Skype line.
3749185	3750706	We know it's an anniversary show.
3750746	3753488	We know there's a lot of people that want to call in tonight probably.
3754048	3756390	At least there's been quite a few people in chat telling me they want to call.
3756410	3758151	We encourage everybody to call in tonight.
3758171	3759772	We'll give a little extra time for that to happen.
3759852	3763254	But tonight we're doing something special for the phone calls,
3766176	3768017	favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3768037	3771158	It's something we like to call Ask Orange Lounge.
3796061	3798762	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3798782	3802363	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, quien es?
3823029	3823510	Echo 123 Play Old Bumpers
3839016	3839916	All right, there you go.
3839936	3841797	What is your question for Drunami tonight?
3841817	3841857	Um...
3868749	3871330	Have you continued playing La Milana or did you give up on it?
3872291	3875872	I haven't had much time to play La Milana, but I will get into it.
3875992	3883455	It's Nintendo hard, it's Battletoads hard, so I may get into it once I'm finished playing Hellgate for a while.
3884356	3885476	It gets easier later on.
3885836	3891419	I think as far as my Battletoads hard games go, I may start with I Want to Be the Guy.
3892419	3894620	I Want to Be the Guy, that's just retarded.
3894860	3896561	Apples don't fall up.
3897602	3898723	They're more like giant cherries.
3928432	3929013	Uh, I don't know.
3929073	3930613	I will think about that during this call.
3930653	3931034	Hold on.
3931114	3932254	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3932274	3932635	Who's this?
3933495	3934776	Hi, this is Spazinator.
3935276	3936597	Spazinator, what's on your mind?
3936617	3938658	What's your question tonight for us?
3938698	3939338	Oh, wait, first.
3939679	3940179	Hold on, hold on.
3940779	3941500	Wait, wait, Spazinator.
3941680	3942680	You have to enjoy the cake.
3943141	3943701	Nom, nom, nom.
3943941	3945202	Uh, nom, nom, nom.
3945302	3946162	All right, there you go.
3946182	3947543	What's your question for us tonight?
3947963	3954507	Yeah, uh, yeah, I was wondering, uh, just off the top of your head, do you know if there's any chance in hell that, uh,
3955251	3959234	Wow will be coming to either the PS3 or to the Xbox 360?
3972245	3980149	And I think Blizzard realizes that most people that own consoles also own PCs somewhere in their home, so there really wouldn't be a lot of crossover potential.
3980209	3994335	Plus, I think they probably look at games that came out like Final Fantasy XI, which is a really weird analogy to use because Final Fantasy XI was originally developed for the PlayStation 2, and that's how a lot of people in Japan play it, but damn, I cannot play that game unless it's on a PC.
3994995	3995736	Thanks for watching!
4010806	4012867	You have to keep it simple to the console basics.
4013327	4014708	Now, here's the other thing, though.
4015068	4022031	Would a WoW spin-off game, like an arcade game or something else in the Warcraft universe, be counted out for console?
4022071	4022751	Not necessarily.
4022771	4024932	Look at StarCraft Ghost, even though that was cancelled.
4025352	4030515	Something along those lines, I would say, is a much bigger possibility than actually seeing WoW itself on consoles.
4030675	4033216	Look at Champions of Norrath.
4033396	4034456	That was an EverQuiz spin-off.
4034856	4036017	That worked fairly well.
4036457	4036977	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4056405	4058226	MMOs don't really work for consoles.
4058686	4067850	I mean, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online and its sequels and Final Fantasy XI, name a successful console MMO in the States.
4069491	4070531	Yeah, I can't think of any.
4070551	4083097	The only two I ever played was Final Fantasy XI and the console version of EverQuest which came out for the PS2 but I thought the PS2 version of EverQuest was kind of crappy though.
4084199	4090104	I don't know a lot of people that play Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, but Final Fantasy XI in Japan is huge on consoles.
4090464	4091965	And I know a lot of people here that play it.
4092005	4094687	It's probably the most successful console MMO.
4095007	4097990	But anyway, Spazinator, we gotta go so we can get some more questions.
4098070	4098790	Thanks for your question.
4099070	4099631	Enjoy your cake.
4099651	4100051	Sure, thanks.
4100872	4104534	Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4104675	4107577	So, Wii and Vibrator thing?
4107857	4108818	Yeah, Wii Brator.
4109098	4110979	It's just like it sounds.
4111099	4111600	It is a...
4113203	4116484	Peace of software to turn your Wii remote into a vibrator.
4116804	4117964	They have one of this for iPods.
4118745	4126527	And it says it's some sort of thing that it says event vibrator simulation.
4127487	4127747	Alright.
4129288	4130348	Let's go back to the phones.
4130428	4131388	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4131408	4131748	Who's this?
4132629	4134449	Dead Pixels on Raven's Dolphin.
4134649	4138150	Raven's Dolphin, the one and only, the man, the legend.
4138450	4140151	Raven's Dolphin, please enjoy some cake.
4141598	4143980	I'm enjoying some pie, but that's okay.
4144060	4144580	That's all right.
4144720	4145441	Pie is your preference.
4145881	4148843	All right, Ravis Dolphin, what is your question for us here on OLR tonight?
4149543	4158109	My question to you is, over the years, you're all gamers, how much do you think you spent over the years of gaming and money?
4158549	4165973	I actually added up just my Bimani collection one time and exceeded a few thousand dollars on just that.
4167434	4175139	So, I would have to say that I would value my video game collection right now at maybe about $15,000?
4175779	4176299	Maybe more?
4176619	4177080	Wouldn't you say?
4179157	4184701	I honestly don't know Raven's Dolphin, and if I were to think about it, I would probably want to go, like, hang myself.
4184781	4185702	No, not really, not really.
4185742	4186342	I shouldn't be ashamed of it.
4186722	4189304	But, you know, think about the MMOs I've played over the years.
4189344	4192106	You know, $15 a month here, $12 a month there.
4192126	4199271	I mean, that alone has been, I spend easily $100 a month, and then during the holidays, new consoles come out even more on games.
4199311	4201492	God, it's a lot, Raven's Dolphin.
4202433	4207016	Easily, probably in the time that we've been doing OLR alone, I would say, what, six years?
4207036	4207256	$10,000, easily.
4209177	4211938	Do consoles and PC hardware count?
4212419	4214700	Everything that is gaming.
4215540	4233728	I'd have to say, aside from games that were lost, I'd say hardware and software, easily $3,000, $4,000 worth of games, includes the computers I've built and the consoles that I've bought, and monthly fees.
4233968	4235409	It's really a lot.
4236454	4238976	Loki, you do even dare to answer this question?
4238996	4239716	I don't even know.
4240416	4241497	I'm not even going to try to guess.
4242698	4243918	It will make me want to cry.
4244499	4247981	So Raven's Dolphin, thank you very much for your call and making us all want to slash our wrists.
4248581	4249522	I'm sorry, bye.
4249582	4250122	Enjoy your cake.
4250622	4250903	All right.
4250923	4256626	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4256646	4257727	We have another call coming in.
4258227	4259308	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4259348	4259668	Who's this?
4260939	4262500	Hello there, Orange Downs.
4262540	4264302	This is the, uh, well, what?
4264702	4266243	The other one from Sweden.
4266864	4268385	Our Swedish listener.
4268485	4269366	We love you.
4269406	4269946	How are you?
4270787	4271227	Ha ha.
4271888	4272248	Hello.
4272728	4275591	Well, for you, some, an extra big piece of cake.
4275711	4276151	Enjoy.
4276171	4276711	Nom nom nom.
4278132	4278873	Um, duh.
4279093	4279393	Damn.
4280394	4281835	Uh, just, ah, damn.
4281955	4283277	Just a minute.
4283457	4283737	Oh, there.
4284497	4285538	Um, what was my question?
4285558	4285598	Um...
4287099	4292502	I think there was a weird intergalactical transmission while he was trying to eat cake there.
4292562	4297124	I was getting flashbacks from Max Headroom.
4297164	4298264	Dream cakes in my case.
4299965	4300605	What's your question?
4300625	4301025	I'm sorry.
4301926	4308329	My question was, Rob, how do you enjoy end gaming in World of Warcraft?
4309696	4311877	How am I enjoying endgaming in World of Warcraft?
4311897	4325624	Great question, because I've been recently going into raids, 25-man raids now, like Serpent Shrine Cavern, and it's amazing how well-organized a lot of groups are and almost treat it like it's a job.
4325824	4326485	It's amazing.
4326505	4332748	You've got to show up on time, and you've got to be there, and if you don't perform well, then you may not come back the next week.
4333208	4335289	It's fascinating, the kind of culture around it.
4335309	4335810	But as far as...
4336650	4337170	and DarkSakura.
4360600	4364023	Blizzard is actively pushing Blizzard is actively pushing Blizzard is actively pushing
4391485	4395779	People getting towards the end since
4396977	4400520	Square Enix didn't do that exactly?
4401220	4410946	Well, yeah, because Blizzard has kind of reduced the experience caps to make it quicker to get to the Burning Crusade content, and kind of speculation is there's going to be kind of an easier way to get to 80, too.
4410966	4417430	Well, heck, you're going to be able to make characters that start at level 55 in the new expansion, but you have to already have a level 55.
4417490	4419711	But it's still kind of interesting that they're doing that.
4419731	4420412	Yeah.
4421252	4425115	But yeah, I love how Blizzard patches their game all the time with new stuff.
4425135	4436065	And to be fair, other MMOs I've played, and I keep going back to Final Fantasy XI, but only because I've played it for so long, they do that too, but Blizzard just, when they have a whole freaking new zone to it with new quests, it's great.
4436365	4441069	Well, the reason behind all that motivation, I mean, Rob, you're into endgame now, you're raiding.
4441329	4444772	You know how certain encounters are gear checks and some are skill checks?
4445513	4448516	You go to Karazhan nowadays, which is your starting raid,
4449676	4450197	Nightbane?
4450697	4452078	That is your motivation check.
4452738	4456340	If you keep wiping to Nightbane and you give up, you're not cut out for raiding.
4456360	4456900	You know what's funny?
4456940	4458141	I still haven't fought Nightbane.
4458161	4459662	Every time my guild beat it, I wasn't there.
4459742	4461443	But we pretty much have Kara on farm status now.
4461463	4462343	I never got to Kara.
4462603	4464004	I stopped raiding at Molten Core.
4465004	4467886	Oh, well that's also... I see I missed all that stuff.
4467926	4471448	By the way, thanks for the thing on Nightbane.
4471928	4474209	Whatever your name was, since I don't remember.
4474369	4474770	It's Drew.
4475670	4475950	Drew.
4476510	4476871	Thank you.
4477031	4477271	Since...
4478222	4488486	The reason I'm asking is that a few, like last week or so, I myself actually dinged 70 on a shaman, a troll shaman.
4488646	4492028	So there's my reason for asking, by the way.
4493588	4498290	Well, Gratz, just take it nice and easy, work on getting your gear up, and you'll be ready for Kara in no time.
4498630	4500191	Prepare for a lifetime of healing.
4501311	4502072	That's all I have to say.
4502092	4503013	Well, it depends what type he is.
4503053	4503253	All right.
4503473	4504454	We've got to let you go, though, buddy.
4504614	4505415	We're running over.
4505435	4506196	We want to take more calls.
4506316	4506836	Take care.
4507297	4507837	Thanks for the question.
4507857	4508377	Enjoy your cake.
4510079	4510339	All right.
4510359	4513983	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4514163	4515224	I would think you'd know that by now.
4516024	4517326	But if you don't, there you have it again.
4519428	4521990	Any other last-minute stories for us, Loki, while we wait for a few more calls?
4522010	4522290	I have one.
4522631	4523431	Oh, we got another call.
4523471	4523712	Sorry.
4524092	4524853	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4524873	4525153	Who's this?
4527639	4528199	DarkSakura.com
4554955	4559937	It was for the longest time carrot cake, but I have found something that I think I like just a little bit more.
4560537	4564318	And that's carrot cake cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.
4564938	4566299	Stuff is fucking awesome.
4567559	4567859	Amen.
4568580	4569480	I love carrot cake.
4570220	4570961	That sounds good.
4571761	4572061	Loki.
4573312	4578919	My favorite dessert had to have been from my old boss that I worked under at Roundtable.
4578979	4581201	He opened his own restaurant called BJ's.
4582082	4589731	It was a 50-50, basically orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and stuff like that.
4590612	4591013	Pazooki
4607228	4610570	The peanut butter pizookie is so frickin' good.
4610890	4611991	Oh my god.
4612291	4613972	I have sadness about the pizookie.
4614132	4614392	What?
4614892	4619815	I actually, they, I can't, I've had one twice now and both times I've gotten violently ill.
4620576	4623997	Oh, it's a crime because those things are so frickin' good.
4624017	4624878	I'm sorry, I won't say it.
4625458	4626159	I feel your pain.
4626219	4627720	I can't have them anymore because of the low fat thing.
4628000	4629120	So, there you have it.
4629160	4630101	Drew, quickly.
4630561	4640027	Alright, cake pie jokes aside, I'd have to say mine's a toss-up between classic root beer float and chocolate soup.
4641287	4642388	Ew, that sounds gross.
4642428	4653995	No, no, chocolate soup, here we are, chocolate soup is warm chocolate brownie, fudge brownie, topped with chocolate pudding and chocolate whipped cream.
4655802	4660326	Well, you bastard, thanks for making us all hungry, but no, I'm just kidding.
4660386	4662408	Really quickly, do you have a favorite dessert, Gold Banjo?
4663509	4669355	Um, ah, jeez, I should have probably thought of that before I even came on.
4670882	4671262	I don't know.
4671483	4672443	I just like ice cream.
4691571	4708899	1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skyporn's launch radio Jamie, you had a last minute story I did, and this was one sent to us by Rob with two B's You know, I love Disneyland Me too I want to go back to Disneyland But you know, California Adventure is being given this massive facelift, right?
4709120	4709740	Makeover!
4711141	4711742	Well, yeah.
4712943	4715685	At any rate, because, well, they've lost a lot of money.
4716526	4730757	So what they've done at Paradise Pier is they've taken out a lot of the Midway stuff and underneath California Screamin', which is the big roller coaster there, they put something called Midway Mania, which is...
4733147	4736649	It's... I'm trying to find exactly... That's not the new Toy Story ride?
4736989	4737169	No.
4737569	4738309	Oh, I thought it was.
4738509	4738989	No, no, it is.
4739009	4740490	Sorry, it is the new Toy Story ride.
4740530	4740850	Oh, okay.
4741511	4742051	Which looks cool.
4742391	4748093	But it's basically different 3D challenges and mini games and stuff that goes through it.
4748133	4749134	So it's pretty cool.
4750134	4750594	Thanks for watching!
4768288	4768668	Kitsune!
4768708	4769169	Nom nom nom!
4790386	4795069	I was walking through Ikea Bar the other day, and I've been really late on my gaming news.
4795109	4796270	I haven't really kept up with it.
4796310	4800932	And I saw the new Soul Calibur 4 ad that's coming out July 31st.
4800992	4805735	And I was kind of surprised to see Yoda on there, because I hadn't really heard anything about it.
4805855	4809257	So I was wondering if you guys had heard anything about that.
4810117	4814240	Well, there has been quite a bit of news in the States here about what's going on with Soul Calibur 4.
4815350	4820010	and we also had Darth Vader in the PS3 version too.
4820669	4824330	Yeah, somehow Star Wars is suddenly colliding with Soul Calibur World.
4824370	4832593	I don't know what kind of weird licensing is going on there, but yes, Yoda will be in the Xbox 360 version and Darth Vader will be in the PlayStation 3 version of Soul Calibur 4.
4832733	4835514	Both versions will have the Apprentice guy.
4836594	4837634	I don't remember what his name was.
4837654	4845277	The Secret Apprentice from... Not Donald Trump's Apprentice, but Darth Vader's Apprentice from the Force Unleashed games, which are coming out very soon.
4846237	4848098	Wow, so it's only one character per...
4848738	4849759	Star Wars Masters of Terakasi
4874929	4878810	Yeah, I'm sure the Japanese are going to eat that game up because they love Star Wars.
4878830	4879830	You see it everywhere here.
4879850	4881250	You even see it in porn stores.
4882051	4882351	You know what?
4882411	4883751	And maybe that would explain why.
4883771	4889052	Because when we saw it announced here, the reaction was kind of like, what the hell kind of random pairing is that?
4890272	4892613	But then you kind of go, well, I guess it'll work.
4892873	4894953	I guess if Spawn can be in it, why not?
4895213	4896134	But that makes a lot of sense.
4896294	4901055	If it's more of a cultural thing in Japan, they're probably blah, blah, blah, goo, goo, goo, gaga over it.
4901095	4901855	Definitely.
4901955	4902835	Hoping to make up something.
4903676	4906077	and Toys R Us dedicated to it.
4906097	4912021	Hoping to make up some of the ground that maybe Soul Calibur 3 lost because it wasn't quite as well received, at least over here, although I thought it was still great.
4912181	4913822	Mostly because it corrupted memory cards.
4915203	4915783	That's another story.
4916023	4918425	Well, Kitsune, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.
4919166	4920566	Thank you.
4920747	4923548	We always enjoy hearing what's going on across the ocean.
4924049	4928552	We're getting more and more Japanese listeners lately, which is kind of neat.
4929811	4931912	We have AkumaJP in the JustinTV chat.
4931952	4933593	We get a few on email once in a while.
4934493	4934813	Sweet.
4935053	4937094	We love hearing from other people in different parts of the country.
4937414	4939575	In fact, I was just thinking of one of our listeners.
4939595	4940555	I don't know if he's listening tonight.
4940615	4943136	FootyMonster the other day, because he's in Argentina.
4943396	4944597	FootyMonster was in the chat room today.
4945237	4946858	My roommate is in Argentina right now.
4946938	4950799	He's in Buenos Aires with his sister, and he's been posting updates to LiveJournal.
4951039	4952040	FootyMonster's in there right now?
4952680	4952880	is he?
4953201	4961268	in chat, yeah oh, cool you should tell me some fun things to do in Buenos Aires I can pass along to my roommate you know who else is in chat who's not reading his PMs?
4961488	4965271	Bobby Blackwolf is that your not-so-private message?
4965792	4968274	alright hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
4972077	4972618	hello?
4973538	4979624	it's a voice from beyond, as in nothing hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio what's your name?
4981092	4981812	Nope, nothing worked.
4982032	4982332	All right.

4988013	4988853	Orange Lines Radio.
4989093	4989934	Orange Lines Radio.
4989954	4991534	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4991694	4992434	Are you looking at chat?
4994274	4994594	Yeah.
4994674	4995355	Oh, FootyMonster.

4999195	5001016	I don't know if my roommate will... Somebody else call!
5003756	5004136	Now!
5005896	5007217	Oh, you got what you wanted.
5007257	5008317	Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.
5008337	5008657	Who's this?
5009927	5015132	Orange Lounge Radio, Orange Lounge Radio, 1-877-GAME-OMR I'm hearing myself singing.
5015173	5017355	Yeah, oh, Footy Monster.
5017635	5021339	Okay, I don't want to pick up the phone and hear myself.
5021379	5022700	You've got to definitely turn it down.
5023201	5024522	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5024562	5024902	Who's this?
5031221	5041350	Zaku, I baked a special cake for you, here you go Can you taste the deadly neurotoxin?
5041551	5044874	It's a special brownie Zaku, what is your question for you?
5045874	5055638	I don't know, Adam put me up to calling you because of the, you know, Anime Next and everything Oh, I promised you guys could talk about Anime Next Alright, I will make a special exception for you How was Anime Next?
5056559	5065103	It was alright, I mean, mostly liquor and just getting our group party shut down I think Adam remembers Oh, you know it's a good party if they have to shut it down
5066070	5070794	Actually, it's more like the guy across the hall that snitched on us.
5071435	5075459	Yeah, it was pretty loud, so we pretty much gave ourselves up.
5076960	5078461	We gave ourselves up to those guys.
5079262	5082185	So yeah, in terms of the game room, it was...
5083593	5087775	I don't know, I mean, it was a pretty, it was a mix of everything.
5088255	5090395	Slightly bigger than the one last year.
5091356	5096118	Um, well, I mean, the centerpiece was pretty much Brawl, for that matter.
5096898	5100019	Smash Brothers Brawl, so it was like people feeding on that game.
5101967	5121001	but they had every other anime convention game staple like Third Strike, 2DX, other anime based games and that was about it I don't think I have my cameras right there Were there topless girls there?
5121061	5121201	Huh?
5121241	5122862	Were there topless girls there?
5131068	5132869	Um, not really, unfortunately.
5132889	5135390	It's just a lot of noise.
5135490	5138110	Yes, there were boobs, or no, there were no boobs.
5138651	5140371	There were no boobs.
5140811	5143512	How did the party shut down?
5143712	5144973	Tits, or get the fuck out.
5145713	5146153	Maybe.
5146353	5147054	Just kidding.
5148354	5148734	Alright.
5149714	5150795	Zaku, have a good one.
5150815	5152335	I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the con.
5154376	5154676	Alright.
5155376	5157977	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5161550	5163911	Why is the gay guy the one clamoring to see tits?
5163971	5164692	I don't know what it is.
5165532	5168213	Something about, it's that special party atmosphere.
5169254	5170474	Well, Jamie likes tits too.
5171215	5171435	Yes.
5171755	5173476	We're slowly turning you straight, Rob.
5173596	5174636	It's a conspiracy.
5174696	5176557	It's a vast fucking conspiracy.
5176577	5179019	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5179119	5180019	On Skype or 1-8.
5180459	5182240	I'm still hearing myself, my friend.
5182260	5184301	You gotta figure out how to make your sound card.
5184321	5184581	Echo 1-2-3, sir.
5186701	5194688	There's actually studies out there that say it's actually pretty much across the board for guys to have an obsession with boobs no matter if they're gay or straight.
5196229	5198210	Thanks for making me doubt, Jamie.
5198591	5199612	We're going to another phone.
5199912	5200272	I don't know.
5200312	5202174	Maybe boobs will get brought up in this conversation.
5202194	5202674	We'll see.
5202774	5204055	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5204075	5204495	Who's this?
5205316	5206157	Hey, this is Bobby.
5206797	5207118	Hi.
5207458	5208259	Did you say boobie?
5209119	5209980	No, I said Bobby.
5210140	5211962	Hi, Bobby.
5212022	5213203	How are you, my friend?
5213223	5213263	Hi.
5214065	5214705	I'm doing good.
5214845	5226068	Now you, being our neighbor on AllGames.com and definitely helping save our show when the evil Live365 almost shut us down, you, my friend, get an extra large piece of cake.
5226108	5227049	So here, enjoy some cake.
5228069	5229749	Nom, nom, nom!
5231090	5232590	Yes, that was awesome.
5233190	5235731	I think the cops are going to go shut down the party at Bobby's house.
5235771	5236431	He's having too much fun.
5236451	5238472	All right, what is your question for us, my friend?
5240059	5241241	Oh, we have listened to it.
5262728	5269291	But I hear you guys kind of complaining about the state of music games sometimes today, and complaining about certain aspects of music games.
5269331	5277294	So what would a music game have to be, and what would it need to have for you to not complain about it if it was made today?
5277967	5284029	What would a music game have to have or be for us to not bitch about them anymore?
5284850	5285550	Well, okay.
5286130	5290672	Like, if I was gonna go... You're not even necessarily shouting original from the kitchen.
5290772	5298095	I don't think original even has to be the case, because if you look at, like, DDR and stuff, it's been almost the same throughout every release.
5298675	5302877	But I think the thing that's kind of been lost, especially with, like, DDR recently, is...
5303457	5307240	With DDR, when you look at the track list and stuff, there's songs in there.
5307260	5309121	You're like, wow, that's really cool.
5309341	5311582	I want to find out more about this artist or something like that.
5311722	5312863	Or, oh, that's really cool.
5313283	5316365	I'm going to check out some more music of that genre or something like that.
5317106	5322469	But right now, the new releases that come out, it's just like, oh, look, this was on Beatmania.
5322509	5323750	Let's put it in DDR.
5323910	5325891	Oh, hey, look, there's another game from Guitar Freaks.
5326231	5327412	Let's throw it in DDR.
5327592	5328433	Oh, hey, look, this is a...
5329314	5342974	A top 10 song right now on the pop charts Hey, let's put it in DDR There's no real exploration with the music there They're worried about appealing to the masses Instead of just, let's put some good stuff in there and that's it
5343513	5344474	They should let us make one.
5346837	5349119	I've kind of said this before on the show and I still stand by this.
5349159	5355546	My problem with DDR is that it kind of has slipped into this whole... It's just song list update of the year.
5356026	5360471	And there's not a whole lot... I mean, they try to do some new things with every game, but I don't know.
5360511	5362433	DDR is starting to feel a little bit stale to me.
5362553	5362934	And I think...
5363894	5370996	I've said this before, and I still believe that DDR needs to be rebuilt from the ground up completely, and maybe throw a competitive twist in it.
5371116	5382078	I even see the last great mix that I thought there was was Max 2, because you would have to play the songs, and then you would earn points or whatever to unlock the next song.
5382258	5384919	And it was at random of what song would be unlocked next.
5385559	5389242	Thank you, Konami, for every single fucking home release that you spoiled the entire song list for.
5389282	5391083	You know, there's no surprises whatsoever.
5403971	5408752	And for God's sake, I do not want to play through another fucking quest mode to unlock shit.
5409252	5409572	Okay?
5409732	5410853	That was never fun.
5411293	5411553	Ever.
5413353	5414713	I think you did hit the nail on the head with something.
5415393	5417274	I know Jamie wants to talk too.
5417834	5418334	Arcades.
5418434	5423935	I think the fact that arcades have gone downhill have sadly made the whole music game scene kind of follow.
5423955	5425636	And it's just tragic.
5425756	5427896	And there's not a lot that can be helped with that, DarkSakura.
5427916	5430857	I was just going to say the versus mode in Disney's Rave.
5431937	5433118	That was freaking epic.
5433638	5438120	And that was the way to properly do versus battle in a DDR game.
5438480	5439940	And bring back Keyboard Mania.
5440220	5443622	Here's the problem, and I'm going to catch some flack for this.
5443702	5454867	I love Konami to death, but still, every time a competing company comes up with something to enhance the DDR formula, what does Konami do?
5455427	5457668	Konami sues the pants off of them.
5458502	5460463	It happened with Andamiro with Pump It Up.
5460483	5462504	It happened with Roxor and In The Groove.
5462844	5466545	They both added shit to the DDR formula, and they are both rejected.
5467686	5469567	No, they did not add anything to the formula.
5469667	5472108	All they did was rip it off and try to call it their own.
5472488	5473949	Seriously, that's all they did.
5474089	5476710	Oh, they made arrows that you have to stomp on a lot.
5477110	5478230	Ooh, original.
5478470	5480451	Ooh, hold... Oh, Mines.
5480992	5481372	Lame.
5482632	5484833	Mines was retarded, okay?
5485413	5486414	It's retarded.
5487304	5488945	Why did you have to turn it back on me?
5488965	5490246	I didn't have an answer.
5490326	5491306	Because that's what I do.
5517537	5518698	BIMANI Games
5536039	5540181	On the PS1, I had an import console and I imported the games and stuff.
5540201	5545464	Back in the 90s, I was like, man, I wish this genre would come out in the States.
5545544	5546904	I wish it would get big in the States.
5546964	5551666	And I kept waiting for something other than DDR because I don't want to move my legs.
5552667	5560611	And that's why I was really happy to see Guitar Hero finally figure it out that, hey, you've got to put in songs people recognize.
5561548	5565010	And so I thought that was a really great way to do it.
5565310	5574174	However, I can see Guitar Hero and Rock Band possibly becoming the new Madden, where it's roster update 2008 here, buy another set of songs for $60.
5575595	5583439	And now what's different between this and Madden is that now you're going to have to buy new guitars each time, or new controllers, because they...
5584099	5586000	I was just going to say we need a US pop and music.
5610603	5610823	Yes.
5611203	5615266	I think you hit the nail on the head with something kind of in there, at least something I drew from it.
5615626	5621690	I think the reason why Bomani didn't succeed as well outside of DDR in the States is that Konami didn't believe in it.
5622210	5623711	And they have no one but themselves to blame.
5624072	5628895	They should have tried it a lot sooner and they could have gotten a piece of this Guitar Hero drum mania craze.
5628955	5632597	Now they just look like they're third place with this whole rock revolution thing.
5632677	5635479	And shame on them for not realizing what they had before.
5637011	5637591	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5660558	5663341	4 new songs we got in that game.
5663361	5667806	And the least thing to do was make harder note files for Virtual Insanity.
5669348	5674213	If they had a little more faith in it, I think we would have seen something a little more involved.
5676703	5686730	I know they tried, because I remember, actually my first ever experience with Beatmania was actually at one of the very old E3s, I think maybe 98.
5687311	5694296	Konami actually had their Hip Hop Mania arcade machine in the booth, because they were testing it in certain arcades in Chicago.
5695016	5699900	And I fell in love with it then, and that's when I went out to go find the PS1 versions.
5700670	5702132	You know what started me off with it?
5702152	5706056	People complaining about the whole emulator and sim file market.
5706096	5709179	My first Beatmania experience was BM98.
5710640	5711261	Back in the day.
5712061	5721551	And that's when I went out hunting for my 5-key controller and getting a stack of games at Network Video when they still sold games and weren't closed.
5722271	5722692	But I mean...
5724421	5735899	I think it also is to say that the companies I think should be looking towards the people that are making the emulators and sim files because that right there I think is going to be your key indicator of what the community wants.
5737381	5738563	Look to that for inspiration.
5742639	5742939	All right.
5742980	5749961	Well, Bobby, this has been a pretty epic phone call, but it's definitely something that's a part of our history we like to look back on.
5750021	5750781	And you never know.
5750841	5753242	I mean, I always kind of hope there'll be another Beatmania in the U.S.
5753282	5753622	someday.
5753682	5754842	I don't hold my breath over it.
5755222	5764284	But now it's kind of gotten to the point where it's like, well, if Konami's not going to do it, maybe someone else will because music games have shown they can be successful here in the States.
5764764	5765525	But I do agree.
5765585	5766745	I hope they get standardized.
5767225	5771739	because I think that's where it's all going to fall apart is when you have to get one controller for this game, one controller for this game.
5772120	5773384	The mainstream is just not going to buy it.
5774554	5777195	And then the next sequel, you're going to have to get a new controller to work.
5777455	5779556	Do all the stuff that's in the new sequel and stuff.
5779596	5781977	But one last thing about the poppin'.
5782457	5792340	I do think that Konami really should try bringing that poppin' over here because some people, when they come to my apartment, I've got my desktop arcade ASC for poppin' music.
5792360	5793741	And everybody looks at that and they're like, what's that?
5793781	5794941	I'm like, yeah, that's for another music game.
5794961	5796682	They're like, oh, you mean like Guitar Hero?
5796702	5798743	And I'm like, yeah, but you slap the balloons.
5799203	5799583	And they're like...
5800083	5801664	Wow, that sounds cool.
5801704	5802725	Papa Music is great.
5803305	5805186	Papa Music might have a problem coming to the States.
5805246	5806567	It's got a bit of an image problem.
5807668	5809429	People will see it and think it's a kids game.
5809629	5814992	But as far as I know, I think that Papa Music actually has the biggest following in Japan above the other Bimani games.
5815232	5819895	And that's not to say Konami can't put a little effort into Americanizing the game a little bit.
5819915	5822517	And I realize there's a lot of people who listen to this show that go...
5823837	5825438	at the thought of a game getting Americanized.
5825458	5826619	But think about it.
5826699	5829981	How did Guitar Hero and Rock Band become so successful?
5830001	5831802	Because the songs were very American.
5832142	5846770	I think if pop and music could invest the development time into maybe reinventing the interface to be a little more not so childish and getting some good American songs mixed in with the Japanese favorites, it could do well here.
5848011	5848091	Yep.
5848649	5848889	All right.
5849089	5849950	Bobby, we've got to let you go.
5850250	5851191	Just take a couple more calls.
5851211	5852332	Can I have another piece of cake?
5852472	5853253	Of course you can.
5853774	5855035	Nom, nom, nom, nom.
5855735	5856736	Have a good one.
5857057	5858258	By the way, Bobby, the cake was a lie.
5858958	5859198	All right.
5859799	5860179	Just kidding.
5860199	5862041	I hung up on him.
5862061	5862682	I hung up on Bobby.
5862982	5863602	Cake is a pie.
5863642	5864463	No, Bobby's awesome.
5864523	5864803	All right.
5865404	5867766	We'll try to get maybe one more call.
5867806	5869948	Do we have any other last-minute stories here before we get to that?
5872634	5874816	This is Misty Well hello Misty, how are you?
5896056	5899698	I'm doing good, even though I have to open in the morning, I'm still listening.
5900199	5901519	I'm sorry to hear about that.
5901539	5905141	Well, here, just for you, I have a caffeinated orange piece of cake.
5906542	5907063	Enjoy.
5907343	5907823	Awesome.
5908383	5908984	Nom, nom, nom.
5910425	5911085	Om, nom, nom.
5911205	5911705	There you go.
5912426	5913106	She sounds so excited.
5913386	5916328	All right, Misty, what question do you have for us tonight?
5918229	5923352	Why did Scope get screwed over tonight like it did way the hell back in episode 111?
5925202	5926663	Skulk That is an understatement It's better than dessert
5956155	5957676	If I had a band, I think I'd name it that.
5957736	5958677	It's better than dessert.
5959417	5960318	I have a lot of great band names.
5960598	5963780	Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners quickly before we shut off for the night?
5966342	5972546	Not really that I can think of, even though I bet I'm going to get my butt kicked for not asking another particular question.
5972946	5973666	That's all right.
5974527	5975948	Another question you were supposed to ask?
5979670	5982712	You wanted me to ask about the fuck show.
5984237	5986658	The fuck show happens when no one expects it to happen.
5986679	5992483	It's like the apocalypse.
5993544	5995245	The fuck show will sneak up on you eventually.
5995265	5996206	See, here's my problem.
5996446	5998328	Now I think we've hyped the fuck show too much.
5999268	6002491	I don't think it's going to be that funny when it happens.
6003271	6006614	I think it's one of those things where halfway through part A we're going to be like, okay, we need to stop.
6006634	6007775	It's like, all right, fuck it.
6010131	6010751	But we'll see.
6010991	6013052	Yeah, that's what it's starting to seem like to me, too.
6013252	6017814	Yeah, so I'm a little worried about fuck show, but it will... The fuck show will happen when Duke Nukem Forever comes out.
6019935	6020935	We may hold her to that.
6020955	6021495	Fuck is finally out.
6021635	6022556	We may hold her to that.
6022916	6024676	All right, well, Misty, take care of yourself.
6024716	6025537	Have a good one, okay?
6026697	6027477	All righty, you too.
6027577	6028558	Don't fall asleep tomorrow.
6028838	6029098	All right.
6030796	6031537	Happy fucking birthday to me.
6050191	6050832	Happy, indeed.
6050912	6051793	Happy fucking birthday to you.
6051813	6052213	Happy.
6052453	6052834	Enjoy.
6053594	6054315	Oh, look at that.
6054375	6057979	Miklatov pulled the tail out from between his legs and came back into the studio just in time.
6057999	6059820	Look what the cat pissed on and dragged in.
6059860	6061462	Did you see that Bitmania got third place?
6061742	6062443	It didn't deserve it.
6062623	6062863	All right.
6065066	6066387	Just like Andrew's birthday.
6067528	6068949	Oh, fuck you, buddy.
6069190	6071111	Well, thank you for being here.
6071131	6072453	You're going to be here next week, too, huh?
6072493	6072653	Yeah.
6073233	6075095	Oh, you'll be here for the Tommy Tallarico interview.
6075275	6075896	Oh, goody.
6076456	6077897	I so like him.
6078358	6080159	Your final thought for tonight?
6086245	6087186	I like DJ Maxx.
6089087	6090509	DarkSakura, your final thought for tonight?
6091049	6092010	Reject false icons.
6093183	6095426	My final thought for tonight, reject false MRIs.
6095826	6096147	Loki.
6098169	6102775	My final thought is, I was listening to some all games radios, well, you know, the streaming stuff.
6103136	6106861	There's a lot of Tommy Tallarico music on there, on their playlist there.
6106881	6107722	It's like,
6108162	6108983	Every few songs.
6109103	6110543	He's a friend of the station.
6110563	6110984	I know.
6111384	6112464	And he's also done a lot of stuff.
6112604	6114025	But I just thought it was interesting.
6114065	6118187	Plus, he gives express permission for his music to be played.
6118247	6120969	So, you know, they want to support people.
6121129	6122089	Hey, not knocking anything.
6122109	6123790	I'm just saying it's an observation.
6123810	6125431	It's just an observation.
6126638	6126938	All right.
6128099	6134303	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting as you have for the past six years, even when we weren't a podcast.
6134943	6138025	And for those that have joined us along the way, thank you so much.
6138806	6145130	As we push on to episode 300, our seventh year anniversary and beyond, we couldn't do it without you guys.
6145190	6145790	Thank you so much.
6145830	6149353	And remember, if you enjoy what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell two friends.
6150093	6153117	about our show and it helps spread the word about independent radio.
6153177	6154478	Leave us a review on iTunes.
6154558	6158722	God, we could use some more of those five-star reviews and so on and so on.
6160144	6160765	All that good stuff.
6161185	6168793	So thank you and good night and we'll see you next time, next week, Tommy Tallarico in episode number 285.
6169314	6170235	I'm starting to lose count.
6170315	6171616	You know you're old when you start losing count.
6171656	6172077	Have a good night.
6172745	6173265	See you next week!
6204126	6204375	and more.
