[SPEAKER_03]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.841 --> 00:20.601
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

00:45.515 --> 00:46.536
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:14.233 --> 01:14.793
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:14.913 --> 01:15.193
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:15.594 --> 01:15.854
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.915
[SPEAKER_05]: But it might be a live action show from what I understand, so yay.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.716
[SPEAKER_10]: But not like Heroes Heroes.

01:20.836 --> 01:21.756
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because this is better.

01:21.776 --> 01:23.377
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't have a crappy second season.

01:23.577 --> 01:23.797
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:26.018 --> 01:26.658
[SPEAKER_10]: I sense benefits.

01:26.678 --> 01:27.399
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard of that book.

01:27.439 --> 01:29.079
[SPEAKER_12]: I was actually thinking about picking it up one time.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.080
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I shall pick it up.

01:31.701 --> 01:32.061
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:32.881 --> 01:34.262
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll actually read it if I pick it up.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.384
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't hear Shane, so I'm... All right.

01:40.111 --> 01:43.954
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, going over to Andrew as well as joining us tonight.

01:43.974 --> 01:45.835
[SPEAKER_10]: You've known him as several different names throughout the years.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.357
[SPEAKER_10]: There was, let's see, 23rd Magus and Drew Nami.

01:49.038 --> 01:52.500
[SPEAKER_10]: He's still here and was 17 when our show started, which makes me feel old.

01:52.621 --> 01:53.882
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just won't leave.

01:54.222 --> 01:55.463
[SPEAKER_05]: I was 19, that means.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.483
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

01:56.644 --> 01:57.544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still the freshman.

01:57.564 --> 01:58.385
[SPEAKER_07]: When's my promotion?

01:58.885 --> 01:59.846
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought of you the other day.

01:59.866 --> 02:02.168
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

02:02.268 --> 02:02.748
[SPEAKER_05]: How long ago?

02:02.768 --> 02:03.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I might have already been here.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.573
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about three days ago when I was at Dimple Records looking at High School Musical 2.

02:08.613 --> 02:08.833
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:10.874 --> 02:14.117
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's get back into some video game news, shall we, Loki?

02:15.658 --> 02:18.921
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will not be talking about High School Musical anything.

02:19.041 --> 02:19.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah!

02:19.621 --> 02:22.163
[SPEAKER_05]: It has video games, and that's newsworthy.

02:22.444 --> 02:23.645
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

02:25.386 --> 02:29.729
[SPEAKER_08]: But, there is some other stuff that's a little bit more newsworthy, and it...

02:30.877 --> 02:31.537
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero World Tour

02:50.988 --> 02:55.351
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the new features with it, they'll actually, the pads are a lot quieter.

02:55.992 --> 03:00.015
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you may remember that the cymbals are a little bit raised up as well.

03:00.635 --> 03:05.059
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've got three kind of drums on the bottom and of course a kick drum.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.103
[SPEAKER_08]: And also they will be touch sensitive.

03:10.223 --> 03:15.387
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you like hit them harder, it'll be louder and so on and so forth.

03:16.891 --> 03:42.664
[SPEAKER_08]: some other cool stuff also it's wireless now on the guitar remember last week we talked about a certain leak that happened about there being a touch sensitive portion of the guitar well that turns out to be true and actually the I guess brand new touch sensitive slider on the neck will allow you to do all sorts of different things what are you doing?

03:42.824 --> 03:44.905
[SPEAKER_10]: don't mind the music I'm trying to prep something else for later

03:45.990 --> 03:46.831
[SPEAKER_08]: www.darksakura.com

04:06.571 --> 04:16.900
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it looks like, yeah, the slider, it says, will allow you to play with sustained notes by finger sliding up the strip area.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.563
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says also can be used to tap out notes as well.

04:21.364 --> 04:22.344
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

04:24.386 --> 04:27.169
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have lots of pictures on all your favorite gaming sites.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.530
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we did not carry them.

04:30.251 --> 04:31.772
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so what do you think?

04:32.233 --> 04:34.034
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's neat, but, you know, I...

04:37.370 --> 04:41.113
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm afraid, though, that Hutch sends a portion on the bottom there for, like, solos and stuff.

04:41.873 --> 04:45.937
[SPEAKER_08]: It's enough to make it different than Rock Band, but that's about it.

04:46.537 --> 04:50.360
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if it was Buttons, they would have just said, hey, you're ripping off Rock Band.

04:51.401 --> 04:52.542
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

04:52.642 --> 04:53.623
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's gimmicky.

04:55.484 --> 04:56.365
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my opinion.

04:57.126 --> 05:01.689
[SPEAKER_14]: The guitar looks cool to me, but the drum set totally gave me flashbacks of Drum Mania.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.612
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you move the cymbals out and there you go.

05:07.810 --> 05:12.334
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess we will see what happens in Guitar Hero.

05:12.374 --> 05:13.495
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are you guys going to get it?

05:14.956 --> 05:16.557
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it on order, but I don't know.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.099
[SPEAKER_08]: You might cancel that pre-order?

05:19.299 --> 05:26.064
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's just like, I don't know, I don't play much of rock bands, so why would I buy another fucking drum set?

05:26.925 --> 05:33.951
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it looks cool, and it might be fun to play, but I'm kind of getting tired of buying peripherals and shit for games.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.702
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when, you know, they keep changing the guitar up just enough so that you'll have to buy it each year.

05:40.322 --> 05:40.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw it.

05:42.303 --> 05:42.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw it!

05:43.283 --> 05:48.826
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, and besides, you know, it's neat to do the little, like, you know, whammy stuff on there.

05:49.186 --> 05:57.169
[SPEAKER_08]: They did mention, though, with the new guitar, there's gonna be some pretty cool things you can do with the music editor, which is cool if you're into that, but... I don't know, it's just...

05:58.769 --> 05:59.630
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

06:16.138 --> 06:18.379
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't really heard of anything about Rock Band 2 yet.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.001
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, and we're probably going to cover this a little later.

06:22.722 --> 06:23.602
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, E3.

06:23.682 --> 06:26.264
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be honest, we're probably going to cover this a little bit later.

06:26.804 --> 06:33.128
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some other peripherals out there for the current games that look pretty kick-ass as well.

06:33.348 --> 06:35.990
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, I mean, I don't know.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.252
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an improvement, but I don't think it's enough.

06:40.372 --> 06:40.773
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

06:41.073 --> 06:41.733
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, moving on.

06:41.793 --> 06:43.314
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, this is an improvement.

06:43.374 --> 06:44.075
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you want to say something?

06:44.095 --> 06:44.595
[SPEAKER_09]: No, absolutely not.

06:45.587 --> 06:47.049
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:01.403 --> 07:02.603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yumi Hoshi Yumi Hoshi

07:31.094 --> 07:33.416
[SPEAKER_10]: who is the card division VP.

07:33.476 --> 07:35.478
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know Konami had a card division, but there you go.

07:35.798 --> 07:42.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote, we look forward to reaching out to an array of players of all ages and sharing the excitement of the group-oriented role-playing card game Blue Dragon.

07:42.483 --> 07:50.950
[SPEAKER_10]: It is our expectation that the character designs of esteemed creator Akira Toriyama combined with the unique gameplay of Blue Dragon will create countless new fans within the card game community.

07:51.351 --> 07:52.792
[SPEAKER_10]: To which I say, meh.

07:54.968 --> 08:09.262
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to also mention, because I think I've mentioned this before, but the original Guitar Freaks 2 and 3 on the original PlayStation had a song editor in it as well.

08:09.643 --> 08:16.890
[SPEAKER_08]: So this isn't anything really brand new, but I'm sure people will call it innovative because they forget so soon.

08:20.700 --> 08:25.570
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it takes about 10 years before someone forgets about you, so we have a few more years to go before people actually forget about us.

08:26.656 --> 08:35.101
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, something that, at least a series that I'm pretty sure no one has really forgotten about because Loki brought it up in an earlier part of the show anyway.

08:35.961 --> 08:43.245
[SPEAKER_14]: The Raiden series, Raiden 4, is coming out on Xbox 360, hopefully in September, developed by Moss.

08:44.406 --> 08:46.347
[SPEAKER_14]: And we should be seeing it.

08:46.427 --> 08:51.510
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, they're saying in Japan by September, according to Famitsu.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

08:53.411 --> 08:57.916
[SPEAKER_14]: It will have new stages and Xbox Live support.

08:58.396 --> 09:00.679
[SPEAKER_14]: You can share your saved games with people.

09:01.760 --> 09:07.126
[SPEAKER_14]: And it also supports swivel monitors so that you can use it in the portrait position.

09:09.022 --> 09:13.647
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, you know, a lot of the old shooters used to have that capability, you know?

09:14.048 --> 09:16.270
[SPEAKER_14]: You could turn your TV on the side and it'd work the same way.

09:16.991 --> 09:26.221
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think this would be cool, although I don't, you know, don't turn your 15-inch, you know, TVs on their end unless you got a proper stand for it or something, but that's pretty cool.

09:26.301 --> 09:27.763
[SPEAKER_14]: I love, I love this game series.

09:27.783 --> 09:28.944
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of my favorite shooters ever.

09:29.845 --> 09:30.286
[SPEAKER_14]: So cool.

09:33.476 --> 09:35.097
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm looking forward to Raiden as well.

09:35.117 --> 09:38.139
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they have that compilation of the Raiden.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.841
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget what they call it, Raiden something.

09:40.821 --> 09:47.306
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, some other cool stuff coming out to Xbox 360 pretty soon.

09:48.086 --> 09:53.971
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've heard about this game for quite a while now, but it's apparently being released, I think, next week, actually.

09:54.091 --> 09:55.892
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.

09:56.292 --> 09:57.773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's coming out on June 25th.

09:59.374 --> 10:14.521
[SPEAKER_08]: and then there's also another game which is kind of along the same lines as Catan or Carcassonne but Ticket to Ride is another board game now turned Xbox Live Arcade game that's going to be coming out sometime soon.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.641
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of this.

10:15.962 --> 10:16.542
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this about?

10:16.602 --> 10:17.462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about trains.

10:18.543 --> 10:24.405
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually move, you set up train routes or whatever and whoever has the longest routes you get points and stuff like that.

10:25.806 --> 10:27.987
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been pretty popular that people like, you know,

10:28.487 --> 10:29.249
[SPEAKER_08]: Those other games.

10:30.150 --> 10:37.123
[SPEAKER_08]: But no word on when that one's coming out, but probably relatively soon now that it has an Xbox.com page.

10:39.166 --> 10:39.507
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

10:42.037 --> 10:44.238
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess we'll see what happens with that.

10:44.678 --> 11:00.624
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and actually, the speculation though from Xbox 360 fanboys is that the last time that Xbox pages appeared for unreleased Xbox Live Arcade games, Frogger 2 and Commando 3, they appeared the very next week.

11:00.884 --> 11:04.286
[SPEAKER_08]: So, happy tree friends, and maybe take it a ride next week.

11:04.966 --> 11:12.189
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, speaking of speculation and the Xbox 360, you remember that big mass of things that leaked last week?

11:12.209 --> 11:14.850
[SPEAKER_10]: The rumors that were probably taken down, by the way, the next day.

11:16.131 --> 11:18.892
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody wants to comment on that whole situation.

11:19.052 --> 11:21.133
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the games that was revealed in that was Lips.

11:21.553 --> 11:22.013
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:40.387 --> 11:53.038
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of interesting is a lot of people have been kind of putting pieces together and then an anonymous tipster showed up on Joystick apparently saying that Inez is actually the ones that are developing lips on the Xbox 360.

11:53.999 --> 12:00.205
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it kind of makes sense because you already knew that they were working on an Xbox 360 game and it was probably going to be music-based.

12:00.525 --> 12:02.207
[SPEAKER_10]: All the pieces are coming together.

12:02.667 --> 12:03.708
[SPEAKER_10]: So, kind of neat.

12:04.690 --> 12:12.876
[SPEAKER_14]: That just sounds like a game that I recently actually watched a commercial for that's coming out in Japan.

12:13.536 --> 12:15.358
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the life of me, I'm trying to remember the name of it.

12:15.978 --> 12:18.080
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a karaoke game.

12:18.660 --> 12:26.726
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can actually program your own music into it, as well as sing along with songs that you can enter into it.

12:26.766 --> 12:28.167
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's something band-based.

12:30.051 --> 12:39.020
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say... It made me think of Degrassi because the name is similar to it, but I'm trying to find the name of it, so give me a second.

12:39.040 --> 12:39.881
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll see if I can't get it.

12:39.901 --> 12:40.642
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of random.

12:40.702 --> 12:41.963
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes you think of Degrassi.

12:42.163 --> 12:43.905
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no, the name looks a lot like it.

12:45.506 --> 12:49.230
[SPEAKER_05]: There needs to be a game about Degrassi because I watch that show religiously.

12:49.450 --> 12:51.052
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you do in a Degrassi game?

12:51.632 --> 12:52.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Fawn over Marco.

12:53.714 --> 12:54.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

12:57.185 --> 12:59.707
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we'll not be fawning over Marco.

13:01.008 --> 13:02.650
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Guitar Hero World Tour, though.

13:03.310 --> 13:14.280
[SPEAKER_08]: So good news, though, and we were kind of worried about this, but like some of the other music games out there, Guitar Hero 3 downloads will work in Guitar Hero World Tour.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

13:16.462 --> 13:16.562
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh,

13:20.560 --> 13:22.001
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why, but whatever

13:39.392 --> 13:42.013
[SPEAKER_14]: and other rock band related news.

13:42.453 --> 13:46.915
[SPEAKER_14]: Offspring is going to be having some songs coming soon.

13:48.835 --> 14:00.360
[SPEAKER_14]: They're supposed to be... Well, I mean, this week we already got Avenged Sevenfold songs, but Offspring is going to be having... As soon as my thing goes back to the stupid page.

14:00.620 --> 14:00.880
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

14:04.537 --> 14:04.917
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

14:06.017 --> 14:08.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, my computer is deciding that it doesn't want to cooperate.

14:09.118 --> 14:11.098
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, come out and play.

14:11.238 --> 14:12.478
[SPEAKER_14]: Self-esteem gone away.

14:12.638 --> 14:13.179
[SPEAKER_14]: All I want.

14:13.639 --> 14:16.079
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty fly for a white guy and the kids aren't all right.

14:16.419 --> 14:20.340
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's according to Offspring's official website.

14:21.260 --> 14:26.281
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I'll actually have all I want in the game and I can pretend I'm playing Crazy Taxi.

14:27.501 --> 14:27.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

14:28.661 --> 14:29.461
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's what I want to do.

14:31.142 --> 14:31.722
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like fun.

14:32.582 --> 14:32.682
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

14:33.405 --> 14:33.745
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

14:34.065 --> 14:37.347
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what also sounds like fun are these cute little bobbleheads.

14:37.407 --> 14:42.951
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Halo-themed bobbleheads, and they're going to be coming to you at Comic-Con.

14:43.671 --> 14:46.533
[SPEAKER_10]: So you actually... What?

14:47.438 --> 14:47.638
[SPEAKER_13]: DIGASO

15:11.242 --> 15:18.469
[SPEAKER_10]: and also they're kind of hyping up the Halo novel because there's some people that are into actually just getting novelizations.

15:19.656 --> 15:20.256
[SPEAKER_10]: Warcraft Novelizations

15:45.374 --> 15:45.454
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.382
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's actually fairly deep.

16:16.964 --> 16:18.166
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested in such things.

16:19.948 --> 16:20.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

16:22.131 --> 16:22.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Well!

16:23.598 --> 16:24.018
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio

16:52.111 --> 16:53.652
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm just reading this comment in the chat.

16:53.732 --> 16:57.033
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, No one will buy the novelization because there's no teabagging in it.

16:58.834 --> 17:02.315
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I forget, too, I did post a link to that commercial in the chat room.

17:02.876 --> 17:05.117
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Daigaso Band Brothers is what it is.

17:05.777 --> 17:06.037
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.558
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's talk about Listless tonight.

17:08.738 --> 17:12.820
[SPEAKER_10]: Listless is a game we like to play here on Orange Lounge Radio where we come up with the definitive list.

17:13.820 --> 17:14.401
[SPEAKER_10]: of something.

17:14.761 --> 17:17.083
[SPEAKER_10]: And tonight that something is going back to our roots.

17:17.143 --> 17:17.964
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to take a look.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.986
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, DDR is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.308
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at the 6th year of Orange Launch Radio.

17:23.328 --> 17:29.993
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you remember, Orange Launch Radio was formed because DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all actually met playing DDR at the arcade.

17:30.053 --> 17:31.034
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, crazy but true.

17:31.074 --> 17:31.955
[SPEAKER_10]: It's how it actually happened.

17:32.315 --> 17:35.358
[SPEAKER_10]: We all met through that and decided to start this radio show because of it.

17:35.418 --> 17:42.043
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when we started Orange Launch Radio, it was about strictly pretty much music-based video games and what was going on in the scene.

17:42.123 --> 17:42.724
[SPEAKER_10]: Tournaments,

17:43.184 --> 17:44.605
[SPEAKER_10]: and all that kind of stuff.

17:45.525 --> 17:58.909
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyhow, tonight we're actually going to sort of look back at that and try to decide with our scientific listless process the best Bomani song of the past 10 years.

17:58.969 --> 18:01.710
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be DDR, 2DX, anything is fair game.

18:02.090 --> 18:02.930
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's how it works.

18:03.270 --> 18:11.813
[SPEAKER_10]: All five of us here in studio tonight, that would be myself, DarkSakura, Loki, Drew, and Miklatov have all picked their top three, which will compile into a list of 15.

18:12.953 --> 18:13.553
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

18:31.741 --> 18:58.992
[SPEAKER_10]: Who also love Bomani We're probably going to piss you off with the stuff we left out But keep in mind we only had room for three songs on each of our lists over the past ten years And we can pick whatever the hell we want So unfortunately I need to kill Crystal Waters here Because tonight I'm going to try to play clips from the songs For those of you that do not know the Bomani game so well At least you can feel like you know what we're talking about So we can play some clips of the songs for you guys So sorry Crystal Waters, you're out tonight

18:59.372 --> 19:00.794
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:14.568 --> 19:18.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, um, it is Turning the Motor Over, from Beatmania.

19:19.129 --> 19:20.450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite.

19:20.510 --> 19:21.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there it is.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's freaking awesome.

19:24.491 --> 19:25.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know how else to describe it.

19:26.151 --> 19:30.133
[SPEAKER_05]: The singer guy, Jeff Kruse, is like, in a dream with his voice.

19:30.193 --> 19:33.214
[SPEAKER_05]: And, it's a great song.

19:33.254 --> 19:37.835
[SPEAKER_05]: It just got revived in a home version of 2DX Gold, because it's that awesome.

19:40.277 --> 19:44.659
[SPEAKER_13]: This one's actually going to be fun to play.

19:46.220 --> 19:49.121
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Shane's number three is Turning the Motor Over.

19:49.201 --> 19:50.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go over to Drew.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.062
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your number three pick tonight?

19:52.462 --> 19:54.483
[SPEAKER_07]: My number three pick is Bitmania.

19:56.204 --> 20:02.507
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitmania, and this was from 2DX8thStyle, if I've done my research right.

20:05.797 --> 20:07.778
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it about this song that makes you want to put it on the list?

20:08.558 --> 20:12.239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's old school, and it's got a very clear vocal part to it.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.280
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it really good to play, especially in the arcade.

20:15.300 --> 20:20.342
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember playing 8th Style over at Scandia for the first time, and this was the first time I played on an arcade machine.

20:21.550 --> 20:24.252
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there's Drew's number three pick, Bitmania.

20:24.313 --> 20:26.374
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll start with Loki, what's your number three pick?

20:26.655 --> 20:30.318
[SPEAKER_08]: My number three pick is Reign of Sorrow, and it's from Max 2.

20:31.679 --> 20:35.002
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was fun, it was like, I don't know, I just like the steps in it.

20:35.923 --> 20:39.866
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just has those fun steps as it catches on.

20:40.047 --> 20:44.691
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Reign of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick, let's listen to it for a little bit.

20:52.314 --> 20:52.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Chorus.

20:52.715 --> 20:59.636
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Reign of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.397
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go next, Jamie, or do you want me to go?

21:01.817 --> 21:02.497
[SPEAKER_14]: I can go.

21:02.657 --> 21:03.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what do you want?

21:03.377 --> 21:06.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Brilliant to you, OG, from DDR Second Mix.

21:06.558 --> 21:07.479
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your number three pick.

21:07.739 --> 21:08.579
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry, my number three?

21:08.799 --> 21:09.039
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

21:09.259 --> 21:10.159
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's my number three.

21:10.319 --> 21:12.280
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Brilliant to you, OG Mix.

21:23.174 --> 21:24.035
[SPEAKER_10]: And why this song?

21:24.555 --> 21:31.261
[SPEAKER_14]: It used to be my very favorite, but I had actually changed my mind on my official number one because of the fun factor.

21:31.321 --> 21:35.485
[SPEAKER_14]: So this one, though, was like the song I played every freaking time.

21:35.885 --> 21:41.450
[SPEAKER_14]: I played a two-second mix because that was my first one that I actually owned.

21:41.850 --> 21:44.032
[SPEAKER_14]: Although the first one I played was a 1.5.

21:45.093 --> 21:45.473
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

21:45.493 --> 21:46.114
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's old school.

21:47.647 --> 21:49.849
[SPEAKER_10]: My number three pick, I love this song.

21:49.889 --> 21:51.691
[SPEAKER_10]: It's from Beatmania 2DX.

21:51.751 --> 21:55.515
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say it showed up early in 5th style, but it actually was a full song in 6th style.

21:55.975 --> 21:56.876
[SPEAKER_10]: Love is dreaminess.

22:04.483 --> 22:05.784
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the video.

22:05.804 --> 22:07.366
[SPEAKER_10]: The video is so freaking adorable.

22:08.367 --> 22:10.328
[SPEAKER_10]: It almost makes the song a little guy with little arms.

22:11.550 --> 22:12.951
[SPEAKER_10]: Look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.

22:14.446 --> 22:22.359
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitmania, Reign of Sorrow, Brilliant 2, OG Mix, and Love is Dreaminess.

22:22.580 --> 22:23.661
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane, what did you pick for number two?

22:25.288 --> 22:28.289
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked, sorry, I picked, what did I pick?

22:28.749 --> 22:36.991
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on Time from Guitar Freak's Drum Mania because that was like the first Drum Mania song I ever played.

22:37.091 --> 22:39.351
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like so freaking good.

22:39.431 --> 22:41.312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just the constant having it.

22:41.332 --> 22:41.872
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.

22:41.892 --> 22:44.072
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even do the chorus.

22:44.132 --> 22:44.452
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it.

22:49.844 --> 22:50.144
[SPEAKER_06]: Better?

22:51.045 --> 22:58.249
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what I was telling Shane is that I called the song The Arm Breaker when I got good enough at Drum Mania to play this one in the intermediate.

22:58.789 --> 23:02.491
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, yeah.

23:03.611 --> 23:09.054
[SPEAKER_14]: It was all the drumming that was all on the left side, and then you had to hit your cymbal really on the little splash part.

23:09.615 --> 23:10.835
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

23:11.015 --> 23:11.996
[SPEAKER_10]: Andrew, your number two pick.

23:13.176 --> 23:15.738
[SPEAKER_07]: My number two pick is Caution.

23:18.462 --> 23:19.243
[SPEAKER_10]: Now why this one?

23:19.283 --> 23:21.086
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like from old school.

23:22.348 --> 23:29.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it ought to be obvious that I used to follow DDR freestyle and nothing reminds me of DDR freestyle like 18 style.

23:29.458 --> 23:32.102
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have the classic cocky drop.

23:41.418 --> 23:45.979
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you describe what a caution drop is for those that weren't listening to our show when we were doing DDR stuff?

23:46.039 --> 23:50.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, a caution drop is one of the classic DDR freestyle moves.

23:51.441 --> 23:58.623
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the freestyler hops onto up and right and then drops back onto their hands onto down and left.

23:59.023 --> 24:02.144
[SPEAKER_07]: So they just kind of slam back down onto the pad.

24:03.185 --> 24:06.686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool when it's done right, but it can hurt you a lot if you do it wrong.

24:07.964 --> 24:17.943
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Caution, also known as, I can probably not pronounce this, Wongo, Yongo, or Don't Bother Me, because that's what it was called in Pump It Up, because it's a better game.

24:19.719 --> 24:20.799
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you have it.

24:21.740 --> 24:25.541
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Loki, what was your... I'm getting all mixed up here.

24:26.582 --> 24:27.962
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to juggle like five different screens here.

24:27.982 --> 24:29.283
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what was your number two pick?

24:29.363 --> 24:33.885
[SPEAKER_08]: My number two pick was Era, the nostril mix or whatever it is.

24:34.165 --> 24:34.685
[SPEAKER_08]: Nostril?

24:34.705 --> 24:37.226
[SPEAKER_08]: The nostril mix.

24:37.326 --> 24:38.567
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wasn't nostril.

24:40.788 --> 24:42.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was just a cool song.

24:42.268 --> 24:42.889
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a tack.

24:43.829 --> 24:45.550
[SPEAKER_10]: And our live listeners heard this during the break tonight.

24:45.950 --> 24:46.170
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

24:47.390 --> 24:48.711
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

24:50.060 --> 24:50.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you have it.

24:50.880 --> 24:51.741
[SPEAKER_10]: Era, the NostalMix.

24:51.761 --> 24:53.101
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, you guys and Jack get to vote.

24:53.141 --> 24:57.902
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think it was one of the first songs that had the speed change in DDR4thMix, I want to say.

24:58.923 --> 24:59.123
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

24:59.143 --> 25:00.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

25:01.043 --> 25:07.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unless you consider, was it... Absolute.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.126
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that was 5thMix.

25:09.326 --> 25:09.926
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking... .59.

25:12.947 --> 25:14.908
[SPEAKER_08]: No, .59 was also 4th.

25:15.388 --> 25:18.749
[SPEAKER_08]: There is that love... Whatever, I'll remember it from 3rdMix.

25:18.989 --> 25:19.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways...

25:20.382 --> 25:20.963
[SPEAKER_10]: Love this feeling?

25:21.483 --> 25:22.344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, love this feeling.

25:22.364 --> 25:23.605
[SPEAKER_08]: That has to be changed.

25:23.685 --> 25:26.207
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a funny story about this song.

25:26.427 --> 25:27.668
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

25:28.769 --> 25:32.652
[SPEAKER_14]: I scared Dan one time.

25:32.933 --> 25:37.276
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if he remembers this, but the first time I ever beat that song in 7 key, I screamed.

25:38.197 --> 25:41.320
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I had been trying for like an hour, doing nothing but playing that song.

25:42.361 --> 25:43.221
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's like, what's wrong?

25:43.702 --> 25:48.166
[SPEAKER_14]: I beat era O. And he went back to doing what he was doing.

25:52.532 --> 26:04.700
[SPEAKER_10]: so that's it alright so that's why I like sorry I was turning on the lights in the studio I can't leave this computer chair for like two seconds alright DarkSakura what would your number two pick be?

26:05.321 --> 26:20.991
[SPEAKER_14]: my number two pick is Dancer from Beatmania 8th Style Beatmania 2DX 8th Style that's not the Beatmania version yeah it is Devon this is it

26:22.230 --> 26:22.950
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the middle of it.

26:28.852 --> 26:32.774
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an album version of it.

26:33.494 --> 26:34.194
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, gotcha.

26:34.614 --> 26:42.077
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I like that song because you just have people dancing in the background and doing the stupid arm-waving pose and holding up a doll.

26:42.537 --> 26:45.378
[SPEAKER_10]: The video was the greatest 2DX video they ever made, period.

26:45.458 --> 26:47.358
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they made a better video than Dancer.

26:48.539 --> 26:48.819
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

26:50.739 --> 27:16.855
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so Dancer is Jamie's number two pick, okay, my number two pick, I gotta preface this, you're gonna hate my number two pick, and I don't care, screw you, because honestly, it's my list of top three, and honestly, I can say this with all honesty, if it were not for this song, or more specifically, this band, I would not have, like, been all, like, gaga over Japanese DDR as I was, like, this song, this song, or this band, was an enabler to me for DDR.

27:17.095 --> 27:17.235
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh.

27:18.387 --> 27:24.569
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's why my number two pick is Erotic with Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.

27:38.595 --> 27:40.417
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh Nick, please not so quick, my number two pick.

27:40.958 --> 27:44.262
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, yes, with the crappy rapping and everything, you just gotta love it so bad.

27:44.682 --> 27:48.347
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, now we get to the number one picks, right?

27:48.387 --> 27:51.270
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a list of ten, so let's add the number ones.

27:52.191 --> 27:56.657
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane Miklatov, what is your number one favorite Bomani song of all time?

27:57.608 --> 28:20.118
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one favorite Beemani song of all time would be Boom Boom Dollar from DDR because it is the first DDR song I ever heard and the lyrics cracked me up because I didn't know what was going on because I just heard it on like an internet radio thing I used to listen to and so I thought the premise of DDR was you had to hit the arrows for more time because it said pushing all the buttons

28:20.638 --> 28:21.259
[SPEAKER_05]: More time.

28:21.939 --> 28:24.961
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I understand it's kind of true because if you don't hit the arrows, you die.

28:25.421 --> 28:27.023
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not the way I thought.

28:27.343 --> 28:29.144
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love this song so much.

28:29.344 --> 28:29.665
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

28:29.825 --> 28:30.405
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

28:30.445 --> 28:31.306
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom Boom Dollar.

28:32.386 --> 28:34.588
[SPEAKER_10]: Mikko Top's number one favorite Bomani song of all time.

28:34.908 --> 28:39.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew, what is your number one most favoritest Bomani song of all time?

28:39.772 --> 28:41.593
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so hard to pick.

28:41.633 --> 28:44.035
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I'm going to piss off the other old school people.

28:44.855 --> 28:48.278
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have to say my number one is Zephyr.

28:53.543 --> 28:54.884
[SPEAKER_06]: This song is great.

28:54.964 --> 28:56.025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's epic.

28:56.045 --> 29:00.927
[SPEAKER_06]: The video, the vocals, the strings, the difficulty.

29:02.728 --> 29:03.729
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hell of a song.

29:05.590 --> 29:07.191
[SPEAKER_10]: This song is pretty fucking epic.

29:07.471 --> 29:08.132
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that.

29:08.152 --> 29:10.093
[SPEAKER_10]: It just screams epic.

29:10.953 --> 29:13.775
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the song that you imagine Itagaki burning things to.

29:17.372 --> 29:22.336
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Loki, your number one favorite Bomani song of all time.

29:22.376 --> 29:31.084
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably one of the first songs I ever played, and I have to say, out of all the songs I've played in DDR, I'd say I've probably played this song the most.

29:33.686 --> 29:38.050
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been in, I would say, probably the most DDR mixes possible.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.292
[SPEAKER_08]: Dynamite Rave.

29:52.995 --> 29:55.317
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Dynamite Rave is one of those songs that age well.

29:55.337 --> 29:58.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember in the beginning of this show, we used to make fun of this song all the freaking time.

29:58.959 --> 30:01.301
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we were just so annoyed by it, how it showed up everywhere.

30:01.621 --> 30:05.324
[SPEAKER_10]: But looking back like six years now, this song was actually pretty fun.

30:05.384 --> 30:07.265
[SPEAKER_10]: Drop E and hump the coin return.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.633
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, your number one favorite Bomani song of all freaking time.

30:38.607 --> 30:43.889
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have to say that I'm going to go with Heaven is a 57 Metallic Grey just because it's so fun.

30:44.690 --> 30:52.213
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that fun?

30:54.194 --> 30:58.055
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I think it was funny what the original name was supposed to be.

30:58.095 --> 30:59.336
[SPEAKER_07]: Heaven is a 57 Chevrolet?

30:59.356 --> 30:59.756
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

31:00.636 --> 31:04.018
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they didn't want the... They couldn't get licensing on it.

31:07.896 --> 31:09.938
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it in dance.

31:09.958 --> 31:14.201
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I like it in Dance Maniacs is because you do the whole knee scroll and everything.

31:14.882 --> 31:21.367
[SPEAKER_14]: It has you doing stuff that requires lower body and upper body so it actually looks a bit more like you're dancing with it.

31:22.108 --> 31:23.369
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's very swingy.

31:23.409 --> 31:24.249
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's fun.

31:26.171 --> 31:26.411
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's

31:27.796 --> 31:30.877
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Maniacs is kind of the forgotten Bomani game, sadly, too.

31:31.198 --> 31:33.359
[SPEAKER_10]: Table Waxing Revolution.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.701
[SPEAKER_10]: That and Keyboard Mania are off in a corner crying.

31:37.721 --> 31:40.082
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about Dance Maniacs second.

31:41.442 --> 31:44.624
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance Maniacs in marathon mode center.

31:46.225 --> 31:47.985
[SPEAKER_14]: That's happy right there.

31:48.506 --> 31:48.846
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

31:50.106 --> 31:52.608
[SPEAKER_10]: That just leaves me one more song for the list.

31:52.788 --> 31:53.709
[SPEAKER_14]: And no one cares, so bye.

31:54.009 --> 31:54.890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kidding.

31:56.471 --> 31:56.891
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

31:57.252 --> 31:57.532
[SPEAKER_14]: Heart.

31:57.912 --> 31:58.152
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

31:59.173 --> 32:12.183
[SPEAKER_10]: And this song, my number one favorite, is also kind of an enabler of sorts because, honestly, I found a whole lot of new music because of the game this was in and because of this mix and everything.

32:12.584 --> 32:18.028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this song is just my most favorite Bomani song ever, and it's Skulk by Echo Image.

32:32.719 --> 32:34.561
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is, Skulk.

32:35.582 --> 32:39.106
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so that leaves the list right now as this.

32:39.566 --> 32:43.370
[SPEAKER_10]: And while I read the list, I'm curious, chat room, what did we forget?

32:43.911 --> 32:45.793
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get a whole lot of that.

32:45.853 --> 32:47.034
[SPEAKER_14]: I was almost going to put in it.

32:47.414 --> 32:48.175
[SPEAKER_10]: What did we forget?

32:48.195 --> 32:50.638
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what songs almost made it for you guys?

32:51.501 --> 32:58.303
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff that almost made it in for me was Gatchamanota from Poppin' Music and Lupin the Third.

32:59.464 --> 33:08.907
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one that I was really fighting over, though, was Twinbee and the Gradius Full Speed.

33:09.147 --> 33:10.667
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to have just three, isn't it?

33:10.847 --> 33:15.389
[SPEAKER_14]: It is, but I had to really think of the ones that I thought were a bit more pivotal to me, so...

33:15.749 --> 33:15.989
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

33:16.650 --> 33:26.976
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I would say songs that were so close yet so far for me, probably, and now I'm driving light, V35, Flotation, although nobody likes that song.

33:27.056 --> 33:29.318
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up, I hate you, Thunder from 2DXA Style.

33:29.338 --> 33:30.058
[SPEAKER_10]: Flotation was good, shut up.

33:30.879 --> 33:34.761
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like all 2DX songs after those 2DDR songs I have.

33:35.162 --> 33:36.442
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov, what was close for you?

33:36.743 --> 33:41.486
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Rockbeat and Wanda down for my four and five just in case my other three got taken.

33:42.992 --> 33:50.556
[SPEAKER_05]: but I also just realized I really should have put such a feeling or not such a feeling what is it called?

33:51.336 --> 34:08.244
[SPEAKER_05]: one from DDR Hottest Party because it really brought back the feeling of DDR for me just the way it sounds it's by Yuichi so it's pretty good I was just going to say I didn't put love in there which was like my song on repeat for a long time

34:08.504 --> 34:12.967
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting lots of people in chat saying how could we not have Captain Jack on the list.

34:13.488 --> 34:15.049
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a one of us named Captain Jack.

34:15.649 --> 34:17.190
[SPEAKER_14]: Shane says it's because he's dead.

34:17.831 --> 34:18.451
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that.

34:18.511 --> 34:18.871
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

34:18.931 --> 34:19.432
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

34:19.572 --> 34:21.013
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a CD.

34:21.353 --> 34:22.554
[SPEAKER_10]: The songs were catchy.

34:22.714 --> 34:23.775
[SPEAKER_10]: They just weren't my favorite.

34:25.156 --> 34:26.157
[SPEAKER_10]: All of Captain Jack's stuff is on iTunes.

34:26.477 --> 34:28.398
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with Charlie Nash says Moonlight Shadow.

34:28.638 --> 34:29.299
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that song.

34:29.319 --> 34:29.699
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good one.

34:30.119 --> 34:32.001
[SPEAKER_10]: Ghosts in Ordinary... Not Ordinary World.

34:32.021 --> 34:32.461
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

34:32.541 --> 34:35.103
[SPEAKER_10]: Ghosts in Drifting Away for me.

34:35.123 --> 34:35.743
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

34:36.264 --> 34:36.464
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

34:38.386 --> 34:42.670
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked, was it Fantasy from Max 2?

34:44.611 --> 34:47.134
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not the Eurobeat one, the other Fantasy.

34:47.154 --> 34:49.396
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that was in 2DX4, right?

34:49.576 --> 34:51.257
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not that one.

34:51.317 --> 34:52.899
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that was only in Max 2.

34:53.339 --> 34:54.400
[SPEAKER_08]: Too many songs named Fantasy.

34:54.660 --> 34:55.701
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was cool.

34:56.262 --> 35:02.547
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, I would say probably, because we can't forget about Guitar Freaks, Fire.

35:02.668 --> 35:02.948
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire.

35:07.520 --> 35:12.183
[SPEAKER_14]: End of the Century, Frisbee says DXY, Holic, Face, Drew,

35:30.215 --> 35:32.676
[SPEAKER_07]: There were so many that I'd forgotten at the last minute.

35:32.696 --> 35:34.236
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to change my mind on the number one.

35:34.816 --> 35:44.058
[SPEAKER_07]: My backups were Legend of Max, Murmur Twins, Jack and Mark Get Busy, and what was going to be my number one at the last minute.

35:44.118 --> 35:45.978
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh crap, he's going to do it anyway.

35:46.638 --> 35:48.058
[SPEAKER_07]: LED, Something Wonderful.

35:48.638 --> 35:52.459
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to offer the suggestions that Sauce gave me.

35:52.479 --> 35:57.380
[SPEAKER_14]: It was Boom Boom Dollar and El Ritmo Tropical, even though we put Boom Boom Dollar in there.

35:59.450 --> 36:04.020
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on Sunday Nights on All Games, says what?

36:04.100 --> 36:04.681
[SPEAKER_10]: No Linus?

36:05.042 --> 36:05.803
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that song.

36:05.943 --> 36:06.685
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds pretty cool.

36:06.905 --> 36:07.366
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard.

36:07.947 --> 36:08.208
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

36:08.931 --> 36:09.732
[SPEAKER_10]: and Cheer Train.

36:10.712 --> 36:11.312
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no.

36:11.413 --> 36:16.195
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the one that had the stick figures doing the Hadouken with the heart in the video?

36:16.215 --> 36:16.756
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

36:17.296 --> 36:19.517
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that song and I can't remember the name of it.

36:19.897 --> 36:24.740
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a very difficult task ahead of us now and that is we have to reduce this list to 15 to 10.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.181
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be painful.

36:26.621 --> 36:28.122
[SPEAKER_10]: No one take it personally, alright?

36:28.142 --> 36:28.823
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a game.

36:29.864 --> 36:31.865
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here we go.

36:33.465 --> 36:34.865
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the list as it stands so far.

36:34.945 --> 36:48.629
[SPEAKER_10]: Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Reign of Sorrow, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Caution, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Boom Boom Dollars, Zephyr, Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

36:49.309 --> 36:51.970
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

36:53.720 --> 36:54.820
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the list again?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.261
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom Boom Dollar is off the list.

37:20.381 --> 37:21.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

37:21.382 --> 37:22.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

37:22.563 --> 37:23.684
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's on.

37:23.844 --> 37:25.085
[SPEAKER_07]: It is on.

37:27.606 --> 37:29.788
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom Boom Dollar has been stricken from the list.

37:29.808 --> 37:31.950
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that he just did that so that Shane would go pout.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.731
[SPEAKER_10]: As Miklatov runs off to pout.

37:34.852 --> 37:36.933
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

37:39.415 --> 37:43.178
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I just don't like Zephyr.

37:46.280 --> 37:46.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Zephyr.

37:48.129 --> 37:49.129
[SPEAKER_10]: is off the list.

37:51.510 --> 37:52.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're down to 12.

37:52.790 --> 37:55.090
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

37:56.971 --> 38:06.932
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to go with... Yeah, but it's Bitmania, isn't it?

38:08.352 --> 38:09.393
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitmania stays in.

38:09.433 --> 38:10.533
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Bitmania has to stay.

38:10.573 --> 38:11.033
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.314
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane is trying to conspire to get Drew's final song off the list.

38:18.448 --> 38:25.393
[SPEAKER_13]: I am... Will you buy me a chocolate?

38:26.714 --> 38:26.914
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

38:27.154 --> 38:27.975
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not taking bribes.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.057
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna say Reign of Sorrow.

38:32.358 --> 38:35.040
[SPEAKER_10]: Rain of Sorrow has been stricken from the list.

38:36.341 --> 38:38.042
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh, that was the one I was going to take.

38:39.083 --> 38:49.811
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

38:50.451 --> 38:52.553
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe Erotic survived that round.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.416
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, this is hard.

38:57.477 --> 38:58.878
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually like all these songs.

38:59.318 --> 39:00.659
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like all these songs.

39:07.848 --> 39:09.650
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

39:13.635 --> 39:15.778
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna, oh god, I hate to do this.

39:15.858 --> 39:17.059
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna take out Dynamite Rave.

39:17.280 --> 39:17.880
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Loki.

39:19.282 --> 39:22.746
[SPEAKER_10]: It just was staring me a sore thumb like, you don't really like this song, Rob.

39:24.702 --> 39:27.743
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so we are left with 10, a list of 10.

39:28.183 --> 39:28.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is.

39:29.424 --> 39:43.189
[SPEAKER_10]: Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era Nostal Mix, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Heaven is a 57 Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

39:43.209 --> 39:44.950
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

39:44.970 --> 39:45.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

39:47.205 --> 40:05.243
[SPEAKER_10]: So there it is in the chat room, and if you would send me a private message in chat, those of you that are listening live tonight, with your number one and your number two picks, make sure it's clearly listed, or I will assume the first one is your number one pick, and we will reveal the results of the definitive top three Bomani songs ever.

40:05.543 --> 40:09.467
[SPEAKER_14]: And help me try to remember what the hell that song was to that video while you're at it.

40:10.524 --> 40:13.906
[SPEAKER_14]: It had the stick figure doing the heart hadoken.

40:14.726 --> 40:15.266
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

40:15.306 --> 40:16.787
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that song and I couldn't remember it.

40:16.867 --> 40:17.387
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

40:18.408 --> 40:20.669
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we'll get back to some gaming news in the meantime.

40:21.329 --> 40:22.810
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura's gonna start us off.

40:22.970 --> 40:23.851
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, do I gotta?

40:23.891 --> 40:24.331
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta.

40:24.351 --> 40:25.471
[SPEAKER_14]: This is bugging me now.

40:26.372 --> 40:26.732
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob.

40:27.492 --> 40:27.953
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

40:28.853 --> 40:29.313
[SPEAKER_14]: Nom.

40:30.214 --> 40:31.534
[SPEAKER_14]: Nom nom nom nom nom nom.

40:31.654 --> 40:32.555
[SPEAKER_10]: You're hungry or what?

40:33.155 --> 40:34.576
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it has to do with Nintendo.

40:35.456 --> 40:38.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo has filed a trademark in Japan that's called Nom.

40:38.518 --> 40:38.578
[SPEAKER_14]: Nom.

40:39.372 --> 40:40.014
[SPEAKER_14]: Nomnomnom.

40:40.094 --> 40:41.537
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo Online Magazine.

40:41.758 --> 40:42.540
[SPEAKER_14]: N-O-M.

40:44.063 --> 40:47.812
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um... It is, uh...

40:50.746 --> 40:55.707
[SPEAKER_14]: I really, I guess I don't know what to say about, you know, anything other than a Nintendo online magazine.

40:57.168 --> 41:07.790
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's going to be like, well, you know, Nintendo already publishes a regular magazine in Japan and we haven't, I think, is Nintendo Power still in publication?

41:07.850 --> 41:08.090
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

41:08.850 --> 41:12.051
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe this is just going to be condensed versions of them online?

41:13.452 --> 41:19.093
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like, I guess, doesn't EGM have their online site now and all these other places do?

41:19.213 --> 41:19.373
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

41:21.963 --> 41:22.844
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss GamePro.

41:24.124 --> 41:25.125
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I like pro tips.

41:25.145 --> 41:28.947
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss GamePro.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.108
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss GamePro TV.

41:32.269 --> 41:39.813
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, people were saddened earlier this week when there was a brand new Wii update to the Wii menu.

41:40.354 --> 41:49.959
[SPEAKER_08]: Update 3.3, which nullified the Twilight Princess hack and allowed you also to do something with your Miis and the Mii Parade and that kind of thing.

41:50.740 --> 41:51.020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

41:52.566 --> 41:55.667
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42:14.435 --> 42:32.182
[SPEAKER_08]: It altered the name of Apuna and allowed basically hackers to change the name and so the game was looking for a certain name and it was too large for what it was supposed to be and it caused it to crash and then they ran their own code on top of that.

42:32.963 --> 42:33.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, I see.

42:33.943 --> 42:39.186
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't affect people that already had the homebrew channel installed in their system, but now it doesn't even matter anymore.

42:39.266 --> 42:46.030
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're still interested in homebrew or other things, the brand new Twilight hack has been released.

42:46.110 --> 42:47.290
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy.

42:49.292 --> 42:49.552
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

42:51.433 --> 42:56.235
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think this is going to become an ongoing battle like Sony versus their homebrew people?

42:56.496 --> 42:57.136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

42:58.437 --> 42:58.737
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

42:59.137 --> 42:59.877
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do.

43:00.418 --> 43:00.718
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

43:02.099 --> 43:03.320
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:23.331 --> 43:25.572
[SPEAKER_10]: without even copying them over first.

43:25.832 --> 43:30.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning that download content will be available to save on an SD card.

43:30.973 --> 43:33.474
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, somebody, for figuring this out.

43:33.994 --> 43:35.975
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just proves it's possible.

43:37.015 --> 43:39.996
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nintendo just needs to patch their dang system already to make this happen.

43:40.856 --> 43:42.577
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised Rock Band didn't do it first.

43:44.157 --> 43:50.219
[SPEAKER_07]: But with, you know, Rock Band coming out for Wii and all the downloadable content that could be there, but isn't.

43:50.999 --> 43:51.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

43:52.700 --> 43:52.980
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

43:53.567 --> 44:01.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that'll be kind of cool, and I'm happy to see that the Wii will get to participate in that download content, so I'm kind of curious how they're going to incorporate that into the store-thor.

44:01.450 --> 44:02.431
[SPEAKER_10]: The store-thor?

44:02.791 --> 44:03.411
[SPEAKER_10]: The store-tho.

44:03.431 --> 44:05.072
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be interesting.

44:06.243 --> 44:07.604
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still mad that no one spelled me the name of that song.

44:07.644 --> 44:07.764
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

44:33.942 --> 44:37.285
[SPEAKER_14]: First email comes from Spazinator.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.147
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everyone.

44:39.207 --> 44:42.650
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Quick Question, but the letter really is anything but, so I'm still going to read it.

44:43.431 --> 44:44.172
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everyone.

44:44.892 --> 44:50.037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to get your input on an ongoing debate that I'm having with someone.

44:50.457 --> 44:54.221
[SPEAKER_14]: The debate is whether or not any online interaction people...

44:55.502 --> 44:59.447
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, most of this person's E's in the first paragraphs are R's, so it's really bizarre.

45:00.508 --> 45:11.040
[SPEAKER_14]: If any online interactions people have had with each other, whether it be MMOs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI or any other online game for that matter, constitute socializing.

45:13.935 --> 45:41.472
[SPEAKER_14]: My line of thought is that these online interactions is indeed socializing I categorize socializing as the interaction between two or more people for non-business aka fun purposes regardless of the medium involved whether it be in person, online, or whatever as long as person A interacts with person B and vice versa and it's non-business related, it's socializing the only limiting factor in online socializing is that you cannot as of yet beat the living snot out of some other people nor can you have sex with them

45:41.792 --> 45:43.041
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on that, I'm sure.

45:43.886 --> 45:44.873
[SPEAKER_07]: On both counts.

45:46.267 --> 45:49.308
[SPEAKER_14]: For those two things, you have to have that in person.

45:49.948 --> 45:51.809
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this to say that one is better than the other?

45:51.909 --> 45:52.549
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

45:52.669 --> 45:56.691
[SPEAKER_14]: In some cases, in-person socializing is not feasible due to distance and whatnot.

45:57.171 --> 46:08.815
[SPEAKER_14]: How many people are really going to travel hundreds if not thousands of miles to socialize and play games with another person when online will suffice, especially with these high as hell gas prices?

46:09.236 --> 46:10.456
[SPEAKER_14]: What is your take on this issue?

46:12.677 --> 46:14.818
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually do agree that it is socializing...

46:15.698 --> 46:17.399
[SPEAKER_14]: A community is a community.

46:18.340 --> 46:23.923
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I've gone on, back in the days when I played, you know, shit, what was that game?

46:24.303 --> 46:26.225
[SPEAKER_14]: Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

46:27.005 --> 46:27.745
[SPEAKER_14]: We had our groups.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.927
[SPEAKER_14]: We were hanging out and chatting about crap while we busted the crap out of things.

46:31.688 --> 46:35.370
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I hang out with people on Ragnarok.

46:35.470 --> 46:37.231
[SPEAKER_14]: I hang out with a lot of people online.

46:37.832 --> 46:41.614
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really just another medium of communication.

46:42.054 --> 46:56.501
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow for me is especially that World of Warcraft for me is especially like that because you know we go around you know we're doing our thing in Warcraft but I'm having more fun just chatting on Ventrilo and all the crazy antics that happen on there you know talking to people all right it's like a party chat I'm gonna have to make the distinction here

46:59.083 --> 47:10.574
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking to other people on a global game scale, like say on your server in WoW or in Final Fantasy, that's not socializing.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.215
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just there.

47:12.936 --> 47:20.343
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get down to the guild level or the IRC channel level, stuff like that, the guild, the party, the channel, whatever it is,

47:21.309 --> 47:26.251
[SPEAKER_07]: That would probably be a social community, albeit not a very personal one at first.

47:27.051 --> 47:33.414
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would be how you define community, as in your smaller guilds, not your entire server.

47:34.294 --> 47:39.896
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, yeah, I think it's a perfectly viable form of socializing.

47:40.657 --> 47:42.597
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to quote something that Sauce just told me.

47:43.438 --> 47:46.939
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people spend hours talking on the phone, other people spend hours talking in IM.

47:47.039 --> 47:47.559
[SPEAKER_14]: Same difference.

47:48.500 --> 47:48.740
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

47:49.200 --> 47:49.380
True.

47:50.484 --> 47:55.526
[SPEAKER_10]: What's... Especially with a lot of long-distance friendships that technology have allowed us to build.

47:56.166 --> 48:01.327
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the day, it was very hard to have... You'd have a pen pal in a faraway place, and that was pretty much it.

48:02.008 --> 48:07.549
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks to the internet, you can talk to somebody in a whole other country as easily.

48:07.589 --> 48:08.430
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, look at our show.

48:08.490 --> 48:09.970
[SPEAKER_10]: We have people calling us from other countries.

48:09.990 --> 48:12.651
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't cost them anything, thanks to Skype.

48:13.251 --> 48:18.072
[SPEAKER_14]: All my family, a lot of my friends, are all over the country, and this is how I keep in touch with them.

48:18.753 --> 48:19.473
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that...

48:21.036 --> 48:24.617
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, hold on, somebody else... Okay, she said, okay, fine.

48:25.297 --> 48:26.357
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry for misquoting you.

48:26.377 --> 48:28.318
[SPEAKER_14]: She said diff, not difference, whatever.

48:28.758 --> 48:31.678
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to look up something, though, so somebody else add to that.

48:33.219 --> 48:40.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was just going to say real quick that we've joked plenty of times, or at least I've said this, is that World of Warcraft is just a chat room with a fireball spell.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.661
[SPEAKER_10]: A very bad chat room.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.941
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's a great game.

48:46.001 --> 48:48.502
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, on the guild level, it's a very good chat room.

48:49.375 --> 48:51.276
[SPEAKER_07]: In Baron's chat, it's a very bad chat room.

48:51.296 --> 48:53.176
[SPEAKER_10]: You just turn off Baron's chat.

48:53.416 --> 48:53.936
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I do.

48:54.637 --> 48:55.917
[SPEAKER_07]: Trade chat.

48:56.137 --> 48:57.097
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't have to.

48:57.117 --> 48:59.038
[SPEAKER_10]: Trade chat is the new Baron's chat, by the way.

48:59.118 --> 49:00.558
[SPEAKER_14]: I shouldn't have to.

49:00.798 --> 49:08.081
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to dictionary.com, which I love, especially for my stupid nutrition class with my really anal teacher.

49:09.901 --> 49:21.423
[SPEAKER_14]: Socialize is defined as taking part in social activities, interacting with others, or to train for a social environment, to prepare for social life, or to conform to... Oh, that's socialism, sorry.

49:21.984 --> 49:26.244
[SPEAKER_14]: But another one listed on here is to associate or mingle sociably with others.

49:26.985 --> 49:32.886
[SPEAKER_14]: It does not say anywhere in any of these dozens of definitions to physically interact.

49:33.766 --> 49:34.706
[SPEAKER_14]: That's called punching.

49:35.607 --> 49:36.547
[SPEAKER_14]: Or boinking.

49:37.507 --> 49:38.027
[SPEAKER_14]: Or slapping.

49:38.147 --> 49:38.447
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

49:39.508 --> 49:40.388
[SPEAKER_14]: Or staring at them.

49:41.108 --> 49:41.468
[SPEAKER_14]: Bonk.

49:42.348 --> 49:48.870
[SPEAKER_14]: So by the dictionary, there is no requirement to be in person to socialize.

49:49.130 --> 49:52.151
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe Nintendo Maniac 64 rejects your analysis.

49:52.991 --> 49:55.432
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, bah, dictionary.com.

49:55.492 --> 49:56.692
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about the wictionary now.

49:57.493 --> 49:58.093
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

50:00.173 --> 50:00.953
[SPEAKER_14]: WTF ever.

50:01.253 --> 50:02.774
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Urban Dictionary is the best.

50:03.495 --> 50:04.776
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a big freaking whatever.

50:05.016 --> 50:07.538
[SPEAKER_10]: I name all my WoW characters off of Urban Dictionary.

50:07.738 --> 50:08.038
[SPEAKER_14]: You do?

50:08.378 --> 50:08.618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

50:08.698 --> 50:09.119
[SPEAKER_14]: Like what?

50:10.220 --> 50:12.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my main character is called Sassy Pants.

50:12.821 --> 50:13.782
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I still remember?

50:13.982 --> 50:14.182
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

50:14.743 --> 50:15.163
[SPEAKER_14]: Lil' Kim.

50:16.224 --> 50:17.725
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Lil' Kim was my Final Fantasy XI character.

50:17.745 --> 50:19.146
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XI.

50:19.226 --> 50:22.548
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my newest one I just rolled the other night is Drama Llama.

50:24.349 --> 50:26.591
[SPEAKER_10]: A girl who spits out her drama everywhere like a llama.

50:26.611 --> 50:26.751
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

50:27.136 --> 50:27.937
[SPEAKER_14]: I know people like that.

50:28.437 --> 50:36.382
[SPEAKER_14]: So to conclude this letter, also, if I may, I would like to give a quick shout out to some people that I didn't get a chance to when I called in last week.

50:37.023 --> 50:42.146
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello to everyone in the Limit Break Radio link shell on the Odin server on Final Fantasy XI.

50:43.367 --> 50:45.929
[SPEAKER_14]: I played on that server for five seconds.

50:46.769 --> 50:55.235
[SPEAKER_14]: And everyone in the Happy Haven link shell on the Alexander server on Final Fantasy XI, especially Digby Reloaded, Jaden, Brina, and Reku.

50:55.375 --> 50:56.216
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks in advance.

50:57.262 --> 50:58.544
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, memories of Final Fantasy XI.

50:58.584 --> 51:03.910
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's too bad Minklatov ran off to pout because this would be the part where I might say he's trying to get me to play again.

51:04.271 --> 51:04.951
[SPEAKER_10]: I told him no.

51:05.111 --> 51:05.672
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't.

51:06.253 --> 51:07.855
[SPEAKER_14]: Thinking of playing again makes me want to vomit.

51:08.335 --> 51:08.796
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.

51:08.836 --> 51:09.777
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Tarku compels you.

51:10.077 --> 51:10.538
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.

51:11.919 --> 51:13.722
[SPEAKER_10]: No disrespect to those still playing.

51:13.762 --> 51:14.903
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I can't.

51:15.143 --> 51:16.044
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm already playing a good game.

51:16.365 --> 51:17.346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a bad breakup.

51:19.990 --> 51:27.659
[SPEAKER_14]: To go on with the next email, and this is coming from Robert M. Glad to see you're all doing well, shifting without a clutch.

51:28.500 --> 51:39.451
[SPEAKER_14]: From what I've heard from the press releases for the upcoming Guitar Hero World Tour, aka GH4, it will indeed allow you to store purchased and downloaded songs onto your SD cards.

51:39.491 --> 51:40.533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.

51:41.433 --> 51:44.194
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's to hoping more developers are able to do that.

51:44.595 --> 51:47.676
[SPEAKER_14]: I've also been working quite a bit on Space Invaders Extreme.

51:47.836 --> 51:50.617
[SPEAKER_14]: Hard to say which invaders are more annoying in multiplayer.

51:50.998 --> 51:54.799
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mirror Shields, Reflect Types Officially, or the ISBs, Assault Types.

51:55.880 --> 52:00.162
[SPEAKER_14]: This email was brought to you by Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix, Home of the Neverending Story.

52:01.062 --> 52:01.322
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

52:01.742 --> 52:02.483
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the best.

52:03.183 --> 52:09.465
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, when I was talking about Space Invaders Extreme in Part A, I have yet to play multiplayer because I have no friends with the game.

52:10.866 --> 52:12.706
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for Loki, but he'll probably never play it with me.

52:12.806 --> 52:13.767
[SPEAKER_14]: Poor Rob.

52:13.807 --> 52:14.407
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor me.

52:14.427 --> 52:22.510
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this email, this next one comes from someone familiar and near and dear to all of us who stayed with me at Faname last year.

52:22.750 --> 52:22.990
[SPEAKER_14]: Who?

52:23.450 --> 52:24.590
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from Kimera.

52:24.610 --> 52:25.791
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes.

52:25.831 --> 52:26.031
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

52:27.071 --> 52:30.173
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey guys, unfortunately I haven't been able to listen to the episodes lately.

52:30.233 --> 52:31.494
[SPEAKER_14]: Something wrong with podcasts.

52:31.954 --> 52:35.837
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I just wanted to congratulate you all on six years of pure, unadulterated awesome.

52:36.157 --> 52:37.378
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's to six more years.

52:37.498 --> 52:39.319
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, and I think of you every Sunday.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, thank you.

52:41.320 --> 52:41.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

52:41.861 --> 52:42.461
[SPEAKER_14]: We miss you.

52:42.681 --> 52:43.642
[SPEAKER_14]: Come back and visit soon.

52:44.923 --> 52:46.284
[SPEAKER_14]: And one from Hippolytus.

52:48.337 --> 52:48.938
[SPEAKER_14]: Some thoughts.

52:49.738 --> 52:52.140
[SPEAKER_14]: First, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, yes, you are all geeks.

52:52.160 --> 52:56.463
[SPEAKER_14]: You spent ten minutes talking about D&D and then complained that somebody rightly calls you a geek, as if.

52:56.884 --> 53:00.426
[SPEAKER_14]: No, what we complained about was him using geek as a derogatory.

53:01.047 --> 53:08.293
[SPEAKER_14]: So, which actually we very much specified several times over in the last episode.

53:08.333 --> 53:09.454
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as if...

53:10.894 --> 53:28.143
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize we left ourselves wide open for a crack like that, but really what we were saying was not that we had a problem with the fact that he called us a geek, but just the fact that he was being so derogatory about it when it is a flaw of the Nintendo Wii.

53:28.243 --> 53:29.464
[SPEAKER_10]: So, SDFU, sit down.

53:30.908 --> 53:32.409
[SPEAKER_10]: Not you, the guy at Nintendo.

53:32.429 --> 53:34.611
[SPEAKER_14]: Second, updates on Saturday, really?

53:35.731 --> 53:35.932
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

53:36.512 --> 53:37.913
[SPEAKER_14]: Third, Patti LuPone.

53:38.674 --> 53:41.335
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, it's all about Bernadette Peters if you don't have Ethel Merman.

53:44.998 --> 53:47.039
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's criticizing my musical choices.

53:47.079 --> 53:49.121
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, I just pulled one up in iTunes, okay?

53:50.622 --> 53:51.843
[SPEAKER_14]: Bernadette Peters was awesome.

53:51.863 --> 53:53.104
[SPEAKER_14]: She used to be on The Muppet Show all the time.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.861
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I actually really, really dig Bernadette Peters.

53:59.202 --> 54:00.242
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fourth.

54:00.442 --> 54:02.643
[SPEAKER_14]: Import can't decide what to eat now.

54:03.644 --> 54:04.044
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

54:04.424 --> 54:05.004
[SPEAKER_14]: Mini review.

54:05.124 --> 54:07.345
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cookbook for the DS published by Nintendo.

54:07.786 --> 54:13.268
[SPEAKER_14]: You can choose a recipe based on ingredient, source country, difficulty, cooking method, calories, or cooking time.

54:13.668 --> 54:19.051
[SPEAKER_14]: It will create a shopping list for you, and since the DS is so portable, you can take it to the market with you.

54:19.291 --> 54:21.972
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that coming out, and I actually was very interested in

54:22.572 --> 54:23.112
[SPEAKER_14]: I want this.

54:23.132 --> 54:25.153
[SPEAKER_08]: Acquiring that from IP or DS.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.555
[SPEAKER_14]: To continue, awesome features.

54:27.915 --> 54:31.677
[SPEAKER_14]: The recipe will read aloud all the steps to you so you don't have to look at the DS.

54:31.717 --> 54:34.819
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go forward and backward in the recipe with the voice controls.

54:34.899 --> 54:36.560
[SPEAKER_14]: Continue, go back, more info.

54:36.860 --> 54:46.525
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, the only thing that's missing is that, remember how they had that DS cookbook that came out in Japan that had a little thing that plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot that was a magnet so you could stick it to your fridge while you cook?

54:48.026 --> 54:48.546
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

54:49.246 --> 54:50.627
[SPEAKER_14]: But just to conclude the email...

54:53.587 --> 55:01.150
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to the wonderful photos and full voiceover, there are also videos, yes, a return of full motion video, to demonstrate difficult concepts or techniques.

55:01.230 --> 55:05.472
[SPEAKER_14]: In short, this game probably would be a mascot game for Orange Lounge Foodio.

55:06.392 --> 55:11.895
[SPEAKER_14]: This message is brought to you by Y Kitchen, home of the best Nintendo DS inspired food.

55:14.456 --> 55:15.336
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this game.

55:15.876 --> 55:16.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

55:17.117 --> 55:18.037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this game.

55:18.617 --> 55:19.097
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no.

55:19.117 --> 55:19.338
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it.

55:19.398 --> 55:20.218
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already been gotten.

55:21.559 --> 55:26.641
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I've been major food whore lately, as in cooking everything.

55:26.741 --> 55:28.381
[SPEAKER_14]: I made the best beef stew, okay?

55:28.561 --> 55:30.522
[SPEAKER_10]: No, someone on this show a fan of food?

55:31.482 --> 55:33.843
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, I've been cooking a whole lot lately.

55:34.603 --> 55:36.424
[SPEAKER_14]: And my beef stew is stupendous.

55:36.524 --> 55:37.004
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true.

55:37.064 --> 55:40.225
[SPEAKER_10]: She was talking to me about her beef stew for like five minutes before the show started.

55:41.085 --> 55:41.625
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't that sound good?

55:41.645 --> 55:43.426
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's going to make me some, so I'm okay with it.

55:43.446 --> 55:44.446
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm going to bring you some.

55:44.606 --> 55:45.347
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got tons of it.

55:45.407 --> 55:45.627
[SPEAKER_14]: Woohoo!

55:47.592 --> 55:50.857
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, Junami wants to come over to my house and have beef stew.

55:51.778 --> 55:52.099
[SPEAKER_14]: Beefs.

55:53.120 --> 55:53.661
[SPEAKER_10]: More email.

55:54.322 --> 55:54.963
[SPEAKER_10]: Moss email.

55:55.063 --> 55:55.704
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I gotta?

55:56.400 --> 55:57.281
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless there's no more left.

55:57.421 --> 55:57.881
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two more.

55:58.561 --> 56:07.748
[SPEAKER_14]: So I heard you guys mention that this alleged Kenyan should fly the Kenyan flag outside of the Kenyan building in Kenya and throw a gang sign up or something.

56:08.108 --> 56:09.649
[SPEAKER_14]: An OLR gang sign or something.

56:09.889 --> 56:12.030
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought he might need a little inspiration.

56:12.771 --> 56:16.433
[SPEAKER_14]: And the guy sent us pictures of him doing a weird OLR-inspired gang sign.

56:16.493 --> 56:17.434
[SPEAKER_08]: Which was awesome.

56:18.014 --> 56:18.355
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

56:18.435 --> 56:18.955
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty cool.

56:18.995 --> 56:22.618
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, we don't want him to fly the Kenyan... What was Rob wanting to fly the Kenyan flag?

56:23.038 --> 56:26.200
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted a picture in front of that Samara Cafe so I could see how shitty it is.

56:27.841 --> 56:31.123
[SPEAKER_10]: But will you link those pictures in chat so everybody can learn the OLR gang signs?

56:31.483 --> 56:33.324
[SPEAKER_14]: I will, and this came from ParadoxVincent.

56:33.404 --> 56:37.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though we're spreading ParadoxVincent's mug all over our chat room, I'm sure he won't mind.

56:38.247 --> 56:40.389
[SPEAKER_10]: All pictures you send us become our property, so nah.

56:43.250 --> 56:44.991
[SPEAKER_10]: By our property, we mean everybody's property.

56:45.251 --> 56:45.592
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

56:46.612 --> 56:47.553
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the internet!

56:48.995 --> 56:51.035
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is currently posting those links in chat.

56:51.435 --> 56:55.536
[SPEAKER_10]: For those of you guys not in chat, well, I guess that's incentive to join us next time.

56:55.576 --> 56:56.756
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll post this on the forums after the show.

56:56.776 --> 56:58.117
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not Orange Chicken Radio.

56:59.517 --> 57:00.297
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not?

57:00.317 --> 57:02.157
[SPEAKER_14]: Joshy16 says we're Orange Chicken Radio.

57:02.878 --> 57:05.198
[SPEAKER_14]: But I love Orange... I almost had Orange Chicken for dinner last night.

57:05.878 --> 57:06.778
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's Cheesecake Factory.

57:06.798 --> 57:10.619
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, for those in the studio, and also, there's the OLR gang sign right there.

57:11.819 --> 57:13.119
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty nice for those in the studio.

57:13.399 --> 57:14.400
[SPEAKER_14]: Last email!

57:14.540 --> 57:16.000
[SPEAKER_14]: Dun-dun-dun from Dwayne.

57:17.742 --> 57:18.843
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, love the show.

57:19.243 --> 57:28.987
[SPEAKER_14]: With the release of Syphon Filter 3 and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror on the PlayStation Network, what are the chances that Sony will release a PS3 version of Syphon Filter, the most underrated action game ever?

57:29.868 --> 57:34.590
[SPEAKER_14]: Also having a PS make my home the playhouse for my nieces and nephews.

57:35.390 --> 57:39.614
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to get a Guitar Hero rock band game for them to team up on.

57:39.954 --> 57:47.640
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is, well, let's just say we are an urban family not trying to hear Metallica, Def Leppard, or Aerosmith unless it's with Run DMC.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.403
[SPEAKER_14]: More into Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, and Jay-Z.

57:52.424 --> 57:55.326
[SPEAKER_14]: Heck, I will take some old Prince, Michael Jackson, or Marvin Gaye.

57:55.346 --> 57:57.808
[SPEAKER_14]: What are the chances of getting an R&B band or DJ Hero?

57:58.349 --> 57:58.969
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Dwayne.

57:59.009 --> 57:59.249
[SPEAKER_14]: P.S.

57:59.289 --> 58:00.670
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I get a fuck you to gas prices?

58:00.851 --> 58:03.593
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, last I heard, they were working on DJ Hero, so...

58:05.615 --> 58:06.816
[SPEAKER_08]: A Matter of Time, I guess.

58:08.037 --> 58:08.517
[SPEAKER_14]: Eventually.

58:09.998 --> 58:16.203
[SPEAKER_08]: You can always buy Beatmania 2DX, which did come out on PlayStation 2.

58:16.923 --> 58:19.145
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love a home version of Kraken DJ so bad.

58:19.185 --> 58:22.507
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, didn't MTV try a game like that and fail horribly?

58:26.070 --> 58:29.112
[SPEAKER_14]: Personally, I think that they're great because I have Radiohead.

58:30.813 --> 58:32.334
[SPEAKER_14]: I freaking love Radiohead.

58:32.354 --> 58:33.395
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing it needs is Blur.

58:35.180 --> 58:35.520
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi!

58:36.441 --> 58:36.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

58:36.821 --> 58:38.943
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it for email?

58:39.643 --> 58:43.065
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but speaking of blur, I was watching some band on the Graham Norton show yesterday.

58:43.085 --> 58:46.227
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the first time I've ever actually watched any significant amount of this show.

58:47.128 --> 58:52.391
[SPEAKER_14]: And I didn't know who they were, but some guy was playing the keyboard and I was like, this is a bad blur impersonation.

58:53.612 --> 59:02.198
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you want to send us emails and get Jamie all nostalgic for her favorite bands, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails to.

59:03.925 --> 59:11.072
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, we're one story away from tonight's listless results and the revival of another favorite Orange Lounge radio segment.

59:11.932 --> 59:14.395
[SPEAKER_10]: Listless results on the way right after one more story.

59:14.455 --> 59:14.715
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

59:15.154 --> 59:24.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in case you're really, really, really lonely or just need something to hump, I guess, Sega has created a robotic girlfriend for you.

59:25.478 --> 59:30.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Her name, I guess, is Emma, or Eternal Maiden Actualization.

59:31.641 --> 59:36.963
[SPEAKER_08]: And she is... She looks like an Ivo.

59:37.003 --> 59:38.303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, she looks like an Ivo.

59:38.323 --> 59:39.984
[SPEAKER_15]: She looks like an Ivo.

59:40.964 --> 59:43.746
[SPEAKER_08]: And she stands, I guess...

59:45.912 --> 59:46.552
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 inches tall.

59:46.652 --> 59:49.473
[SPEAKER_08]: She can sing, dance, and totally make out with you.

59:49.993 --> 59:53.853
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there is a love mode where she'll hug you and kiss nearby humans.

59:55.514 --> 59:55.954
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

59:56.074 --> 59:57.554
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks like an eyeball.

59:58.434 --> 01:00:00.335
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

01:00:00.455 --> 01:00:04.935
[SPEAKER_08]: It's apparently 18,000 yen or $166 US if you're actually interested in this.

01:00:04.995 --> 01:00:08.236
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's coming out in September in Japan only.

01:00:09.476 --> 01:00:11.156
[SPEAKER_08]: So you gotta import them, girlfriends.

01:00:12.517 --> 01:00:14.297
[SPEAKER_08]: So what, do we call her EE for short?

01:00:16.007 --> 01:00:16.227
[SPEAKER_12]: Emma.

01:00:17.107 --> 01:00:17.328
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

01:00:17.828 --> 01:00:17.908
[SPEAKER_07]: E-E.

01:00:17.968 --> 01:00:18.088
[SPEAKER_07]: E-E.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:18.828
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:00:19.948 --> 01:00:20.209
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:22.489
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks like a freaking AIBO, though.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:22.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoosh.

01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:26.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:27.611
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoosh.

01:00:27.631 --> 01:00:27.811
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

01:00:28.031 --> 01:00:30.032
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the name of the cooking game that was brought up earlier?

01:00:30.052 --> 01:00:31.073
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple people have been asking.

01:00:33.434 --> 01:00:34.754
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have to pull the email back up.

01:00:34.774 --> 01:00:35.214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Cooking Guy.

01:00:35.254 --> 01:00:36.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't decide what to eat.

01:00:37.435 --> 01:00:37.695
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.536
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura will get on that later.

01:00:40.156 --> 01:00:43.157
[SPEAKER_10]: But for now, we're going to reveal who won tonight's list list.

01:00:44.358 --> 01:00:44.618
Hooray.

01:00:44.678 --> 01:00:45.178
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

01:00:47.759 --> 01:00:51.860
[SPEAKER_10]: The top three songs, the definitive list of the best Bomani songs of all time.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that there was any controversy in this process at all.

01:00:55.361 --> 01:00:57.621
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it's time to reveal the list.

01:00:57.761 --> 01:01:02.202
[SPEAKER_10]: Your number three pick was Bitmania.

01:01:09.743 --> 01:01:10.784
[SPEAKER_10]: Was your number three pick.

01:01:10.824 --> 01:01:17.325
[SPEAKER_10]: Your number two pick, and this kind of surprised me, was Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:42.584
[SPEAKER_10]: And the number one best Bomani song of all freaking time as voted by you, our chatroom based on our list here in studio was Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove Up

01:01:51.857 --> 01:01:54.538
[SPEAKER_10]: Which kind of fits that a Naoki song should take the title.

01:01:55.098 --> 01:01:55.779
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there you have it.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.219
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:57.399 --> 01:01:59.640
[SPEAKER_10]: Our not controversial at all list.

01:02:00.821 --> 01:02:01.221
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:02:01.481 --> 01:02:04.002
[SPEAKER_10]: Skulk, one point away from being on that list.

01:02:04.122 --> 01:02:06.523
[SPEAKER_10]: And lots of them tied there in the back, too.

01:02:06.763 --> 01:02:08.944
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have a bone to pick with Skulk.

01:02:09.144 --> 01:02:09.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh, what's that?

01:02:10.365 --> 01:02:11.525
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes me drive too fast.

01:02:12.806 --> 01:02:13.566
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing wrong with that.

01:02:15.876 --> 01:02:16.196
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:02:16.997 --> 01:02:24.362
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's time for the Skype line where you can give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:02:24.582 --> 01:02:28.805
[SPEAKER_10]: But tonight we have a little twist on the Skype line.

01:02:29.185 --> 01:02:30.706
[SPEAKER_10]: We know it's an anniversary show.

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:33.488
[SPEAKER_10]: We know there's a lot of people that want to call in tonight probably.

01:02:34.048 --> 01:02:36.390
[SPEAKER_10]: At least there's been quite a few people in chat telling me they want to call.

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.151
[SPEAKER_10]: We encourage everybody to call in tonight.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.772
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give a little extra time for that to happen.

01:02:39.852 --> 01:02:43.254
[SPEAKER_10]: But tonight we're doing something special for the phone calls,

01:02:46.176 --> 01:02:48.017
[SPEAKER_10]: favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:48.037 --> 01:02:51.158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something we like to call Ask Orange Lounge.

01:03:16.061 --> 01:03:18.762
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:03:18.782 --> 01:03:22.363
[SPEAKER_10]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, quien es?

01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.510
[SPEAKER_10]: Echo 123 Play Old Bumpers

01:03:59.016 --> 01:03:59.916
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you go.

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.797
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your question for Drunami tonight?

01:04:01.817 --> 01:04:01.857
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

01:04:28.749 --> 01:04:31.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you continued playing La Milana or did you give up on it?

01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:35.872
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had much time to play La Milana, but I will get into it.

01:04:35.992 --> 01:04:43.455
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Nintendo hard, it's Battletoads hard, so I may get into it once I'm finished playing Hellgate for a while.

01:04:44.356 --> 01:04:45.476
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets easier later on.

01:04:45.836 --> 01:04:51.419
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as far as my Battletoads hard games go, I may start with I Want to Be the Guy.

01:04:52.419 --> 01:04:54.620
[SPEAKER_06]: I Want to Be the Guy, that's just retarded.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Apples don't fall up.

01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:58.723
[SPEAKER_06]: They're more like giant cherries.

01:05:28.432 --> 01:05:29.013
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I don't know.

01:05:29.073 --> 01:05:30.613
[SPEAKER_10]: I will think about that during this call.

01:05:30.653 --> 01:05:31.034
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

01:05:31.114 --> 01:05:32.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:05:32.274 --> 01:05:32.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

01:05:33.495 --> 01:05:34.776
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

01:05:35.276 --> 01:05:36.597
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator, what's on your mind?

01:05:36.617 --> 01:05:38.658
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your question tonight for us?

01:05:38.698 --> 01:05:39.338
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, first.

01:05:39.679 --> 01:05:40.179
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, hold on.

01:05:40.779 --> 01:05:41.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, Spazinator.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.680
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to enjoy the cake.

01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:43.701
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.202
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, nom, nom, nom.

01:05:45.302 --> 01:05:46.162
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you go.

01:05:46.182 --> 01:05:47.543
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your question for us tonight?

01:05:47.963 --> 01:05:54.507
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, uh, yeah, I was wondering, uh, just off the top of your head, do you know if there's any chance in hell that, uh,

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:59.234
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow will be coming to either the PS3 or to the Xbox 360?

01:06:12.245 --> 01:06:20.149
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Blizzard realizes that most people that own consoles also own PCs somewhere in their home, so there really wouldn't be a lot of crossover potential.

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:34.335
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, I think they probably look at games that came out like Final Fantasy XI, which is a really weird analogy to use because Final Fantasy XI was originally developed for the PlayStation 2, and that's how a lot of people in Japan play it, but damn, I cannot play that game unless it's on a PC.

01:06:34.995 --> 01:06:35.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.867
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to keep it simple to the console basics.

01:06:53.327 --> 01:06:54.708
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, here's the other thing, though.

01:06:55.068 --> 01:07:02.031
[SPEAKER_10]: Would a WoW spin-off game, like an arcade game or something else in the Warcraft universe, be counted out for console?

01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:02.751
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily.

01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:04.932
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at StarCraft Ghost, even though that was cancelled.

01:07:05.352 --> 01:07:10.515
[SPEAKER_10]: Something along those lines, I would say, is a much bigger possibility than actually seeing WoW itself on consoles.

01:07:10.675 --> 01:07:13.216
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Champions of Norrath.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:14.456
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an EverQuiz spin-off.

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.017
[SPEAKER_10]: That worked fairly well.

01:07:16.457 --> 01:07:16.977
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:07:36.405 --> 01:07:38.226
[SPEAKER_07]: MMOs don't really work for consoles.

01:07:38.686 --> 01:07:47.850
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online and its sequels and Final Fantasy XI, name a successful console MMO in the States.

01:07:49.491 --> 01:07:50.531
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't think of any.

01:07:50.551 --> 01:08:03.097
[SPEAKER_01]: The only two I ever played was Final Fantasy XI and the console version of EverQuest which came out for the PS2 but I thought the PS2 version of EverQuest was kind of crappy though.

01:08:04.199 --> 01:08:10.104
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know a lot of people that play Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, but Final Fantasy XI in Japan is huge on consoles.

01:08:10.464 --> 01:08:11.965
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of people here that play it.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.687
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably the most successful console MMO.

01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:17.990
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, Spazinator, we gotta go so we can get some more questions.

01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your question.

01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.631
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy your cake.

01:08:19.651 --> 01:08:20.051
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, thanks.

01:08:20.872 --> 01:08:24.534
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:08:24.675 --> 01:08:27.577
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Wii and Vibrator thing?

01:08:27.857 --> 01:08:28.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Wii Brator.

01:08:29.098 --> 01:08:30.979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like it sounds.

01:08:31.099 --> 01:08:31.600
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a...

01:08:33.203 --> 01:08:36.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace of software to turn your Wii remote into a vibrator.

01:08:36.804 --> 01:08:37.964
[SPEAKER_12]: They have one of this for iPods.

01:08:38.745 --> 01:08:46.527
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says it's some sort of thing that it says event vibrator simulation.

01:08:47.487 --> 01:08:47.747
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:08:49.288 --> 01:08:50.348
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go back to the phones.

01:08:50.428 --> 01:08:51.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:08:51.408 --> 01:08:51.748
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead Pixels on Raven's Dolphin.

01:08:54.649 --> 01:08:58.150
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven's Dolphin, the one and only, the man, the legend.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.151
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven's Dolphin, please enjoy some cake.

01:09:01.598 --> 01:09:03.980
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enjoying some pie, but that's okay.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:04.580
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.441
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie is your preference.

01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:08.843
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Ravis Dolphin, what is your question for us here on OLR tonight?

01:09:09.543 --> 01:09:18.109
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you is, over the years, you're all gamers, how much do you think you spent over the years of gaming and money?

01:09:18.549 --> 01:09:25.973
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually added up just my Bimani collection one time and exceeded a few thousand dollars on just that.

01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:35.139
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I would have to say that I would value my video game collection right now at maybe about $15,000?

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:36.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe more?

01:09:36.619 --> 01:09:37.080
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't you say?

01:09:39.157 --> 01:09:44.701
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly don't know Raven's Dolphin, and if I were to think about it, I would probably want to go, like, hang myself.

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:45.702
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really, not really.

01:09:45.742 --> 01:09:46.342
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't be ashamed of it.

01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:49.304
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, think about the MMOs I've played over the years.

01:09:49.344 --> 01:09:52.106
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, $15 a month here, $12 a month there.

01:09:52.126 --> 01:09:59.271
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that alone has been, I spend easily $100 a month, and then during the holidays, new consoles come out even more on games.

01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:01.492
[SPEAKER_10]: God, it's a lot, Raven's Dolphin.

01:10:02.433 --> 01:10:07.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Easily, probably in the time that we've been doing OLR alone, I would say, what, six years?

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:07.256
[SPEAKER_10]: $10,000, easily.

01:10:09.177 --> 01:10:11.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Do consoles and PC hardware count?

01:10:12.419 --> 01:10:14.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that is gaming.

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:33.728
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to say, aside from games that were lost, I'd say hardware and software, easily $3,000, $4,000 worth of games, includes the computers I've built and the consoles that I've bought, and monthly fees.

01:10:33.968 --> 01:10:35.409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a lot.

01:10:36.454 --> 01:10:38.976
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you do even dare to answer this question?

01:10:38.996 --> 01:10:39.716
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know.

01:10:40.416 --> 01:10:41.497
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even going to try to guess.

01:10:42.698 --> 01:10:43.918
[SPEAKER_10]: It will make me want to cry.

01:10:44.499 --> 01:10:47.981
[SPEAKER_10]: So Raven's Dolphin, thank you very much for your call and making us all want to slash our wrists.

01:10:48.581 --> 01:10:49.522
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, bye.

01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:50.122
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy your cake.

01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:50.903
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:10:50.923 --> 01:10:56.626
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:56.646 --> 01:10:57.727
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another call coming in.

01:10:58.227 --> 01:10:59.308
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:59.348 --> 01:10:59.668
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:02.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello there, Orange Downs.

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.302
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the, uh, well, what?

01:11:04.702 --> 01:11:06.243
[SPEAKER_18]: The other one from Sweden.

01:11:06.864 --> 01:11:08.385
[SPEAKER_10]: Our Swedish listener.

01:11:08.485 --> 01:11:09.366
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you.

01:11:09.406 --> 01:11:09.946
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

01:11:10.787 --> 01:11:11.227
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha ha.

01:11:11.888 --> 01:11:12.248
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:15.591
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for you, some, an extra big piece of cake.

01:11:15.711 --> 01:11:16.151
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:16.711
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom nom nom.

01:11:18.132 --> 01:11:18.873
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, duh.

01:11:19.093 --> 01:11:19.393
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn.

01:11:20.394 --> 01:11:21.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, just, ah, damn.

01:11:21.955 --> 01:11:23.277
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a minute.

01:11:23.457 --> 01:11:23.737
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there.

01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:25.538
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, what was my question?

01:11:25.558 --> 01:11:25.598
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

01:11:27.099 --> 01:11:32.502
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was a weird intergalactical transmission while he was trying to eat cake there.

01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:37.124
[SPEAKER_18]: I was getting flashbacks from Max Headroom.

01:11:37.164 --> 01:11:38.264
[SPEAKER_18]: Dream cakes in my case.

01:11:39.965 --> 01:11:40.605
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your question?

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:41.025
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

01:11:41.926 --> 01:11:48.329
[SPEAKER_18]: My question was, Rob, how do you enjoy end gaming in World of Warcraft?

01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:51.877
[SPEAKER_10]: How am I enjoying endgaming in World of Warcraft?

01:11:51.897 --> 01:12:05.624
[SPEAKER_10]: Great question, because I've been recently going into raids, 25-man raids now, like Serpent Shrine Cavern, and it's amazing how well-organized a lot of groups are and almost treat it like it's a job.

01:12:05.824 --> 01:12:06.485
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:12.748
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to show up on time, and you've got to be there, and if you don't perform well, then you may not come back the next week.

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.289
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fascinating, the kind of culture around it.

01:12:15.309 --> 01:12:15.810
[SPEAKER_10]: But as far as...

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:17.170
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Blizzard is actively pushing Blizzard is actively pushing Blizzard is actively pushing

01:13:11.485 --> 01:13:15.779
[SPEAKER_18]: People getting towards the end since

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:20.520
[SPEAKER_18]: Square Enix didn't do that exactly?

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:30.946
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, because Blizzard has kind of reduced the experience caps to make it quicker to get to the Burning Crusade content, and kind of speculation is there's going to be kind of an easier way to get to 80, too.

01:13:30.966 --> 01:13:37.430
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, heck, you're going to be able to make characters that start at level 55 in the new expansion, but you have to already have a level 55.

01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:39.711
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still kind of interesting that they're doing that.

01:13:39.731 --> 01:13:40.412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:45.115
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I love how Blizzard patches their game all the time with new stuff.

01:13:45.135 --> 01:13:56.065
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be fair, other MMOs I've played, and I keep going back to Final Fantasy XI, but only because I've played it for so long, they do that too, but Blizzard just, when they have a whole freaking new zone to it with new quests, it's great.

01:13:56.365 --> 01:14:01.069
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the reason behind all that motivation, I mean, Rob, you're into endgame now, you're raiding.

01:14:01.329 --> 01:14:04.772
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how certain encounters are gear checks and some are skill checks?

01:14:05.513 --> 01:14:08.516
[SPEAKER_07]: You go to Karazhan nowadays, which is your starting raid,

01:14:09.676 --> 01:14:10.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Nightbane?

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:12.078
[SPEAKER_07]: That is your motivation check.

01:14:12.738 --> 01:14:16.340
[SPEAKER_07]: If you keep wiping to Nightbane and you give up, you're not cut out for raiding.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:16.900
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny?

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.141
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't fought Nightbane.

01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:19.662
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time my guild beat it, I wasn't there.

01:14:19.742 --> 01:14:21.443
[SPEAKER_10]: But we pretty much have Kara on farm status now.

01:14:21.463 --> 01:14:22.343
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got to Kara.

01:14:22.603 --> 01:14:24.004
[SPEAKER_07]: I stopped raiding at Molten Core.

01:14:25.004 --> 01:14:27.886
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well that's also... I see I missed all that stuff.

01:14:27.926 --> 01:14:31.448
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, thanks for the thing on Nightbane.

01:14:31.928 --> 01:14:34.209
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever your name was, since I don't remember.

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:34.770
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Drew.

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:35.950
[SPEAKER_18]: Drew.

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.871
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:37.271
[SPEAKER_18]: Since...

01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:48.486
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason I'm asking is that a few, like last week or so, I myself actually dinged 70 on a shaman, a troll shaman.

01:14:48.646 --> 01:14:52.028
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's my reason for asking, by the way.

01:14:53.588 --> 01:14:58.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Gratz, just take it nice and easy, work on getting your gear up, and you'll be ready for Kara in no time.

01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:00.191
[SPEAKER_10]: Prepare for a lifetime of healing.

01:15:01.311 --> 01:15:02.072
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

01:15:02.092 --> 01:15:03.013
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it depends what type he is.

01:15:03.053 --> 01:15:03.253
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:15:03.473 --> 01:15:04.454
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to let you go, though, buddy.

01:15:04.614 --> 01:15:05.415
[SPEAKER_10]: We're running over.

01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:06.196
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to take more calls.

01:15:06.316 --> 01:15:06.836
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

01:15:07.297 --> 01:15:07.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the question.

01:15:07.857 --> 01:15:08.377
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy your cake.

01:15:10.079 --> 01:15:10.339
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:15:10.359 --> 01:15:13.983
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:14.163 --> 01:15:15.224
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think you'd know that by now.

01:15:16.024 --> 01:15:17.326
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't, there you have it again.

01:15:19.428 --> 01:15:21.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other last-minute stories for us, Loki, while we wait for a few more calls?

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.290
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one.

01:15:22.631 --> 01:15:23.431
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we got another call.

01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:23.712
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

01:15:24.092 --> 01:15:24.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:24.873 --> 01:15:25.153
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

01:15:27.639 --> 01:15:28.199
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

01:15:54.955 --> 01:15:59.937
[SPEAKER_14]: It was for the longest time carrot cake, but I have found something that I think I like just a little bit more.

01:16:00.537 --> 01:16:04.318
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's carrot cake cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.

01:16:04.938 --> 01:16:06.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff is fucking awesome.

01:16:07.559 --> 01:16:07.859
[SPEAKER_14]: Amen.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.480
[SPEAKER_19]: I love carrot cake.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:10.961
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds good.

01:16:11.761 --> 01:16:12.061
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

01:16:13.312 --> 01:16:18.919
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite dessert had to have been from my old boss that I worked under at Roundtable.

01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:21.201
[SPEAKER_08]: He opened his own restaurant called BJ's.

01:16:22.082 --> 01:16:29.731
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a 50-50, basically orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and stuff like that.

01:16:30.612 --> 01:16:31.013
[SPEAKER_08]: Pazooki

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:50.570
[SPEAKER_10]: The peanut butter pizookie is so frickin' good.

01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:51.991
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:53.972
[SPEAKER_14]: I have sadness about the pizookie.

01:16:54.132 --> 01:16:54.392
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:16:54.892 --> 01:16:59.815
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually, they, I can't, I've had one twice now and both times I've gotten violently ill.

01:17:00.576 --> 01:17:03.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's a crime because those things are so frickin' good.

01:17:04.017 --> 01:17:04.878
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I won't say it.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:06.159
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel your pain.

01:17:06.219 --> 01:17:07.720
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't have them anymore because of the low fat thing.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.120
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there you have it.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.101
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew, quickly.

01:17:10.561 --> 01:17:20.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, cake pie jokes aside, I'd have to say mine's a toss-up between classic root beer float and chocolate soup.

01:17:21.287 --> 01:17:22.388
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew, that sounds gross.

01:17:22.428 --> 01:17:33.995
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, chocolate soup, here we are, chocolate soup is warm chocolate brownie, fudge brownie, topped with chocolate pudding and chocolate whipped cream.

01:17:35.802 --> 01:17:40.326
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you bastard, thanks for making us all hungry, but no, I'm just kidding.

01:17:40.386 --> 01:17:42.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Really quickly, do you have a favorite dessert, Gold Banjo?

01:17:43.509 --> 01:17:49.355
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, ah, jeez, I should have probably thought of that before I even came on.

01:17:50.882 --> 01:17:51.262
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

01:17:51.483 --> 01:17:52.443
[SPEAKER_19]: I just like ice cream.

01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:28.899
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skyporn's launch radio Jamie, you had a last minute story I did, and this was one sent to us by Rob with two B's You know, I love Disneyland Me too I want to go back to Disneyland But you know, California Adventure is being given this massive facelift, right?

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:29.740
[SPEAKER_14]: Makeover!

01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:31.742
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah.

01:18:32.943 --> 01:18:35.685
[SPEAKER_14]: At any rate, because, well, they've lost a lot of money.

01:18:36.526 --> 01:18:50.757
[SPEAKER_14]: So what they've done at Paradise Pier is they've taken out a lot of the Midway stuff and underneath California Screamin', which is the big roller coaster there, they put something called Midway Mania, which is...

01:18:53.147 --> 01:18:56.649
[SPEAKER_14]: It's... I'm trying to find exactly... That's not the new Toy Story ride?

01:18:56.989 --> 01:18:57.169
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

01:18:57.569 --> 01:18:58.309
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought it was.

01:18:58.509 --> 01:18:58.989
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, it is.

01:18:59.009 --> 01:19:00.490
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, it is the new Toy Story ride.

01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.850
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:19:01.511 --> 01:19:02.051
[SPEAKER_10]: Which looks cool.

01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:08.093
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's basically different 3D challenges and mini games and stuff that goes through it.

01:19:08.133 --> 01:19:09.134
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's pretty cool.

01:19:10.134 --> 01:19:10.594
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

01:19:28.288 --> 01:19:28.668
[SPEAKER_10]: Kitsune!

01:19:28.708 --> 01:19:29.169
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom nom nom!

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:55.069
[SPEAKER_11]: I was walking through Ikea Bar the other day, and I've been really late on my gaming news.

01:19:55.109 --> 01:19:56.270
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really kept up with it.

01:19:56.310 --> 01:20:00.932
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw the new Soul Calibur 4 ad that's coming out July 31st.

01:20:00.992 --> 01:20:05.735
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was kind of surprised to see Yoda on there, because I hadn't really heard anything about it.

01:20:05.855 --> 01:20:09.257
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was wondering if you guys had heard anything about that.

01:20:10.117 --> 01:20:14.240
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there has been quite a bit of news in the States here about what's going on with Soul Calibur 4.

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:20.010
[SPEAKER_14]: and we also had Darth Vader in the PS3 version too.

01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:24.330
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, somehow Star Wars is suddenly colliding with Soul Calibur World.

01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:32.593
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what kind of weird licensing is going on there, but yes, Yoda will be in the Xbox 360 version and Darth Vader will be in the PlayStation 3 version of Soul Calibur 4.

01:20:32.733 --> 01:20:35.514
[SPEAKER_10]: Both versions will have the Apprentice guy.

01:20:36.594 --> 01:20:37.634
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what his name was.

01:20:37.654 --> 01:20:45.277
[SPEAKER_10]: The Secret Apprentice from... Not Donald Trump's Apprentice, but Darth Vader's Apprentice from the Force Unleashed games, which are coming out very soon.

01:20:46.237 --> 01:20:48.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, so it's only one character per...

01:20:48.738 --> 01:20:49.759
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Wars Masters of Terakasi

01:21:14.929 --> 01:21:18.810
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm sure the Japanese are going to eat that game up because they love Star Wars.

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:19.830
[SPEAKER_11]: You see it everywhere here.

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:21.250
[SPEAKER_11]: You even see it in porn stores.

01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:22.351
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:23.751
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe that would explain why.

01:21:23.771 --> 01:21:29.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when we saw it announced here, the reaction was kind of like, what the hell kind of random pairing is that?

01:21:30.272 --> 01:21:32.613
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you kind of go, well, I guess it'll work.

01:21:32.873 --> 01:21:34.953
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess if Spawn can be in it, why not?

01:21:35.213 --> 01:21:36.134
[SPEAKER_10]: But that makes a lot of sense.

01:21:36.294 --> 01:21:41.055
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's more of a cultural thing in Japan, they're probably blah, blah, blah, goo, goo, goo, gaga over it.

01:21:41.095 --> 01:21:41.855
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

01:21:41.955 --> 01:21:42.835
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping to make up something.

01:21:43.676 --> 01:21:46.077
[SPEAKER_11]: and Toys R Us dedicated to it.

01:21:46.097 --> 01:21:52.021
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping to make up some of the ground that maybe Soul Calibur 3 lost because it wasn't quite as well received, at least over here, although I thought it was still great.

01:21:52.181 --> 01:21:53.822
[SPEAKER_10]: Mostly because it corrupted memory cards.

01:21:55.203 --> 01:21:55.783
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another story.

01:21:56.023 --> 01:21:58.425
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Kitsune, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:00.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

01:22:00.747 --> 01:22:03.548
[SPEAKER_10]: We always enjoy hearing what's going on across the ocean.

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:08.552
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting more and more Japanese listeners lately, which is kind of neat.

01:22:09.811 --> 01:22:11.912
[SPEAKER_10]: We have AkumaJP in the JustinTV chat.

01:22:11.952 --> 01:22:13.593
[SPEAKER_10]: We get a few on email once in a while.

01:22:14.493 --> 01:22:14.813
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

01:22:15.053 --> 01:22:17.094
[SPEAKER_10]: We love hearing from other people in different parts of the country.

01:22:17.414 --> 01:22:19.575
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I was just thinking of one of our listeners.

01:22:19.595 --> 01:22:20.555
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if he's listening tonight.

01:22:20.615 --> 01:22:23.136
[SPEAKER_10]: FootyMonster the other day, because he's in Argentina.

01:22:23.396 --> 01:22:24.597
[SPEAKER_09]: FootyMonster was in the chat room today.

01:22:25.237 --> 01:22:26.858
[SPEAKER_10]: My roommate is in Argentina right now.

01:22:26.938 --> 01:22:30.799
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in Buenos Aires with his sister, and he's been posting updates to LiveJournal.

01:22:31.039 --> 01:22:32.040
[SPEAKER_14]: FootyMonster's in there right now?

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:32.880
[SPEAKER_10]: is he?

[SPEAKER_10]: in chat, yeah oh, cool you should tell me some fun things to do in Buenos Aires I can pass along to my roommate you know who else is in chat who's not reading his PMs?

01:23:37.635 --> 01:23:41.339
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I don't want to pick up the phone and hear myself.

01:23:43.201 --> 01:23:44.522
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:44.562 --> 01:23:44.902

[SPEAKER_10]: Zaku, I baked a special cake for you, here you go Can you taste the deadly neurotoxin?

01:24:01.551 --> 01:24:04.874
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special brownie Zaku, what is your question for you?

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:15.638
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, Adam put me up to calling you because of the, you know, Anime Next and everything Oh, I promised you guys could talk about Anime Next Alright, I will make a special exception for you How was Anime Next?

01:24:16.559 --> 01:24:25.103
[SPEAKER_00]: It was alright, I mean, mostly liquor and just getting our group party shut down I think Adam remembers Oh, you know it's a good party if they have to shut it down

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:30.794
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's more like the guy across the hall that snitched on us.

01:24:31.435 --> 01:24:35.459
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty loud, so we pretty much gave ourselves up.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.461
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave ourselves up to those guys.

01:24:39.262 --> 01:24:42.185
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in terms of the game room, it was...

01:24:43.593 --> 01:24:47.775
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I mean, it was a pretty, it was a mix of everything.

01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:50.395
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly bigger than the one last year.

01:24:51.356 --> 01:24:56.118
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I mean, the centerpiece was pretty much Brawl, for that matter.

01:24:56.898 --> 01:25:00.019
[SPEAKER_00]: Smash Brothers Brawl, so it was like people feeding on that game.

01:25:01.967 --> 01:25:21.001
[SPEAKER_00]: but they had every other anime convention game staple like Third Strike, 2DX, other anime based games and that was about it I don't think I have my cameras right there Were there topless girls there?

01:25:21.061 --> 01:25:21.201
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.862
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there topless girls there?

01:25:31.068 --> 01:25:32.869
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not really, unfortunately.

01:25:32.889 --> 01:25:35.390
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a lot of noise.

01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:38.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there were boobs, or no, there were no boobs.

01:25:38.651 --> 01:25:40.371
[SPEAKER_10]: There were no boobs.

01:25:40.811 --> 01:25:43.512
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the party shut down?

01:25:43.712 --> 01:25:44.973
[SPEAKER_00]: Tits, or get the fuck out.

01:25:45.713 --> 01:25:46.153
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

01:25:46.353 --> 01:25:47.054
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

01:25:48.354 --> 01:25:48.734

01:25:55.376 --> 01:25:57.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:03.911
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is the gay guy the one clamoring to see tits?

01:26:03.971 --> 01:26:04.692
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is.

01:26:05.532 --> 01:26:08.213
[SPEAKER_10]: Something about, it's that special party atmosphere.

01:26:09.254 --> 01:26:10.474
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Jamie likes tits too.

01:26:11.215 --> 01:26:11.435
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

01:26:11.755 --> 01:26:13.476
[SPEAKER_10]: We're slowly turning you straight, Rob.

01:26:13.596 --> 01:26:14.636
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a conspiracy.

01:26:14.696 --> 01:26:16.557
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a vast fucking conspiracy.

01:26:16.577 --> 01:26:19.019
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:19.119 --> 01:26:20.019
[SPEAKER_10]: On Skype or 1-8.

01:26:20.459 --> 01:26:22.240
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still hearing myself, my friend.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.301
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta figure out how to make your sound card.

01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:24.581
[SPEAKER_10]: Echo 1-2-3, sir.

01:26:26.701 --> 01:26:34.688
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually studies out there that say it's actually pretty much across the board for guys to have an obsession with boobs no matter if they're gay or straight.

01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:38.210
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for making me doubt, Jamie.

01:26:38.591 --> 01:26:39.612
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to another phone.

01:26:39.912 --> 01:26:40.272
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:26:40.312 --> 01:26:42.174
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe boobs will get brought up in this conversation.

01:26:42.194 --> 01:26:42.674
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

01:26:42.774 --> 01:26:44.055
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:44.495
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

01:26:45.316 --> 01:26:46.157
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is Bobby.

01:26:46.797 --> 01:26:47.118
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:48.259
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say boobie?

01:26:49.119 --> 01:26:49.980
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I said Bobby.

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.962
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Bobby.

01:26:52.022 --> 01:26:53.203
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, my friend?

01:26:53.223 --> 01:26:53.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

01:26:54.065 --> 01:26:54.705
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good.

01:26:54.845 --> 01:27:06.068
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you, being our neighbor on AllGames.com and definitely helping save our show when the evil Live365 almost shut us down, you, my friend, get an extra large piece of cake.

01:27:06.108 --> 01:27:07.049
[SPEAKER_10]: So here, enjoy some cake.

01:27:08.069 --> 01:27:09.749
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom!

01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:12.590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that was awesome.

01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:15.731
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the cops are going to go shut down the party at Bobby's house.

01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:16.431
[SPEAKER_10]: He's having too much fun.

01:27:16.451 --> 01:27:18.472
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what is your question for us, my friend?

01:27:20.059 --> 01:27:21.241
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we have listened to it.

01:27:42.728 --> 01:27:49.291
[SPEAKER_17]: But I hear you guys kind of complaining about the state of music games sometimes today, and complaining about certain aspects of music games.

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:57.294
[SPEAKER_17]: So what would a music game have to be, and what would it need to have for you to not complain about it if it was made today?

01:27:57.967 --> 01:28:04.029
[SPEAKER_10]: What would a music game have to have or be for us to not bitch about them anymore?

01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:05.550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:10.672
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if I was gonna go... You're not even necessarily shouting original from the kitchen.

01:28:10.772 --> 01:28:18.095
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think original even has to be the case, because if you look at, like, DDR and stuff, it's been almost the same throughout every release.

01:28:18.675 --> 01:28:22.877
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the thing that's kind of been lost, especially with, like, DDR recently, is...

01:28:23.457 --> 01:28:27.240
[SPEAKER_08]: With DDR, when you look at the track list and stuff, there's songs in there.

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.121
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, wow, that's really cool.

01:28:29.341 --> 01:28:31.582
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to find out more about this artist or something like that.

01:28:31.722 --> 01:28:32.863
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, oh, that's really cool.

01:28:33.283 --> 01:28:36.365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to check out some more music of that genre or something like that.

01:28:37.106 --> 01:28:42.469
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, the new releases that come out, it's just like, oh, look, this was on Beatmania.

01:28:42.509 --> 01:28:43.750
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it in DDR.

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:45.891
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, look, there's another game from Guitar Freaks.

01:28:46.231 --> 01:28:47.412
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's throw it in DDR.

01:28:47.592 --> 01:28:48.433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, look, this is a...

01:28:49.314 --> 01:29:02.974
[SPEAKER_08]: A top 10 song right now on the pop charts Hey, let's put it in DDR There's no real exploration with the music there They're worried about appealing to the masses Instead of just, let's put some good stuff in there and that's it

01:29:03.513 --> 01:29:04.474
[SPEAKER_12]: They should let us make one.

01:29:06.837 --> 01:29:09.119
[SPEAKER_10]: I've kind of said this before on the show and I still stand by this.

01:29:09.159 --> 01:29:15.546
[SPEAKER_10]: My problem with DDR is that it kind of has slipped into this whole... It's just song list update of the year.

01:29:16.026 --> 01:29:20.471
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's not a whole lot... I mean, they try to do some new things with every game, but I don't know.

01:29:20.511 --> 01:29:22.433
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR is starting to feel a little bit stale to me.

01:29:22.553 --> 01:29:22.934
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think...

01:29:23.894 --> 01:29:30.996
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said this before, and I still believe that DDR needs to be rebuilt from the ground up completely, and maybe throw a competitive twist in it.

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:42.078
[SPEAKER_08]: I even see the last great mix that I thought there was was Max 2, because you would have to play the songs, and then you would earn points or whatever to unlock the next song.

01:29:42.258 --> 01:29:44.919
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was at random of what song would be unlocked next.

01:29:45.559 --> 01:29:49.242
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Konami, for every single fucking home release that you spoiled the entire song list for.

01:29:49.282 --> 01:29:51.083
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's no surprises whatsoever.

01:30:03.971 --> 01:30:08.752
[SPEAKER_08]: And for God's sake, I do not want to play through another fucking quest mode to unlock shit.

01:30:09.252 --> 01:30:09.572
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

01:30:09.732 --> 01:30:10.853
[SPEAKER_08]: That was never fun.

01:30:11.293 --> 01:30:11.553
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever.

01:30:13.353 --> 01:30:14.713
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you did hit the nail on the head with something.

01:30:15.393 --> 01:30:17.274
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Jamie wants to talk too.

01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:18.334
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcades.

01:30:18.434 --> 01:30:23.935
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the fact that arcades have gone downhill have sadly made the whole music game scene kind of follow.

01:30:23.955 --> 01:30:25.636
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just tragic.

01:30:25.756 --> 01:30:27.896
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's not a lot that can be helped with that, DarkSakura.

01:30:27.916 --> 01:30:30.857
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say the versus mode in Disney's Rave.

01:30:31.937 --> 01:30:33.118
[SPEAKER_13]: That was freaking epic.

01:30:33.638 --> 01:30:38.120
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the way to properly do versus battle in a DDR game.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.940
[SPEAKER_13]: And bring back Keyboard Mania.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:43.622
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the problem, and I'm going to catch some flack for this.

01:30:43.702 --> 01:30:54.867
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Konami to death, but still, every time a competing company comes up with something to enhance the DDR formula, what does Konami do?

01:30:55.427 --> 01:30:57.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami sues the pants off of them.

01:30:58.502 --> 01:31:00.463
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened with Andamiro with Pump It Up.

01:31:00.483 --> 01:31:02.504
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened with Roxor and In The Groove.

01:31:02.844 --> 01:31:06.545
[SPEAKER_07]: They both added shit to the DDR formula, and they are both rejected.

01:31:07.686 --> 01:31:09.567
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they did not add anything to the formula.

01:31:09.667 --> 01:31:12.108
[SPEAKER_08]: All they did was rip it off and try to call it their own.

01:31:12.488 --> 01:31:13.949
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, that's all they did.

01:31:14.089 --> 01:31:16.710
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they made arrows that you have to stomp on a lot.

01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:18.230
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, original.

01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:20.451
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, hold... Oh, Mines.

01:31:20.992 --> 01:31:21.372
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame.

01:31:22.632 --> 01:31:24.833
[SPEAKER_08]: Mines was retarded, okay?

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:26.414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's retarded.

01:31:27.304 --> 01:31:28.945
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did you have to turn it back on me?

01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:30.246
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have an answer.

01:31:30.326 --> 01:31:31.306
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's what I do.

01:31:57.537 --> 01:31:58.698
[SPEAKER_17]: BIMANI Games

01:32:16.039 --> 01:32:20.181
[SPEAKER_17]: On the PS1, I had an import console and I imported the games and stuff.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:25.464
[SPEAKER_17]: Back in the 90s, I was like, man, I wish this genre would come out in the States.

01:32:25.544 --> 01:32:26.904
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish it would get big in the States.

01:32:26.964 --> 01:32:31.666
[SPEAKER_17]: And I kept waiting for something other than DDR because I don't want to move my legs.

01:32:32.667 --> 01:32:40.611
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I was really happy to see Guitar Hero finally figure it out that, hey, you've got to put in songs people recognize.

01:32:41.548 --> 01:32:45.010
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I thought that was a really great way to do it.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:54.174
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I can see Guitar Hero and Rock Band possibly becoming the new Madden, where it's roster update 2008 here, buy another set of songs for $60.

01:32:55.595 --> 01:33:03.439
[SPEAKER_17]: And now what's different between this and Madden is that now you're going to have to buy new guitars each time, or new controllers, because they...

01:33:04.099 --> 01:33:06.000
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just going to say we need a US pop and music.

01:33:30.603 --> 01:33:30.823
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:33:31.203 --> 01:33:35.266
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you hit the nail on the head with something kind of in there, at least something I drew from it.

01:33:35.626 --> 01:33:41.690
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the reason why Bomani didn't succeed as well outside of DDR in the States is that Konami didn't believe in it.

01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:43.711
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have no one but themselves to blame.

01:33:44.072 --> 01:33:48.895
[SPEAKER_10]: They should have tried it a lot sooner and they could have gotten a piece of this Guitar Hero drum mania craze.

01:33:48.955 --> 01:33:52.597
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they just look like they're third place with this whole rock revolution thing.

01:33:52.677 --> 01:33:55.479
[SPEAKER_10]: And shame on them for not realizing what they had before.

01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:57.591
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:34:20.558 --> 01:34:23.341
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 new songs we got in that game.

01:34:23.361 --> 01:34:27.806
[SPEAKER_07]: And the least thing to do was make harder note files for Virtual Insanity.

01:34:29.348 --> 01:34:34.213
[SPEAKER_10]: If they had a little more faith in it, I think we would have seen something a little more involved.

01:34:36.703 --> 01:34:46.730
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they tried, because I remember, actually my first ever experience with Beatmania was actually at one of the very old E3s, I think maybe 98.

01:34:47.311 --> 01:34:54.296
[SPEAKER_17]: Konami actually had their Hip Hop Mania arcade machine in the booth, because they were testing it in certain arcades in Chicago.

01:34:55.016 --> 01:34:59.900
[SPEAKER_17]: And I fell in love with it then, and that's when I went out to go find the PS1 versions.

01:35:00.670 --> 01:35:02.132
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what started me off with it?

01:35:02.152 --> 01:35:06.056
[SPEAKER_14]: People complaining about the whole emulator and sim file market.

01:35:06.096 --> 01:35:09.179
[SPEAKER_14]: My first Beatmania experience was BM98.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.261
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the day.

01:35:12.061 --> 01:35:21.551
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when I went out hunting for my 5-key controller and getting a stack of games at Network Video when they still sold games and weren't closed.

01:35:22.271 --> 01:35:22.692
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean...

01:35:24.421 --> 01:35:35.899
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it also is to say that the companies I think should be looking towards the people that are making the emulators and sim files because that right there I think is going to be your key indicator of what the community wants.

01:35:37.381 --> 01:35:38.563
[SPEAKER_14]: Look to that for inspiration.

01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:42.939
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:49.961
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Bobby, this has been a pretty epic phone call, but it's definitely something that's a part of our history we like to look back on.

01:35:50.021 --> 01:35:50.781
[SPEAKER_10]: And you never know.

01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:53.242
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I always kind of hope there'll be another Beatmania in the U.S.

01:35:53.282 --> 01:35:53.622
[SPEAKER_10]: someday.

01:35:53.682 --> 01:35:54.842
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't hold my breath over it.

01:35:55.222 --> 01:36:04.284
[SPEAKER_10]: But now it's kind of gotten to the point where it's like, well, if Konami's not going to do it, maybe someone else will because music games have shown they can be successful here in the States.

01:36:04.764 --> 01:36:05.525
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do agree.

01:36:05.585 --> 01:36:06.745
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope they get standardized.

01:36:07.225 --> 01:36:11.739
[SPEAKER_10]: because I think that's where it's all going to fall apart is when you have to get one controller for this game, one controller for this game.

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.384
[SPEAKER_10]: The mainstream is just not going to buy it.

01:36:14.554 --> 01:36:17.195
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the next sequel, you're going to have to get a new controller to work.

01:36:17.455 --> 01:36:19.556
[SPEAKER_17]: Do all the stuff that's in the new sequel and stuff.

01:36:19.596 --> 01:36:21.977
[SPEAKER_17]: But one last thing about the poppin'.

01:36:22.457 --> 01:36:32.340
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think that Konami really should try bringing that poppin' over here because some people, when they come to my apartment, I've got my desktop arcade ASC for poppin' music.

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.741
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody looks at that and they're like, what's that?

01:36:33.781 --> 01:36:34.941
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, yeah, that's for another music game.

01:36:34.961 --> 01:36:36.682
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like, oh, you mean like Guitar Hero?

01:36:36.702 --> 01:36:38.743
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, yeah, but you slap the balloons.

01:36:39.203 --> 01:36:39.583
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're like...

01:36:40.083 --> 01:36:41.664
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, that sounds cool.

01:36:41.704 --> 01:36:42.725
[SPEAKER_07]: Papa Music is great.

01:36:43.305 --> 01:36:45.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Papa Music might have a problem coming to the States.

01:36:45.246 --> 01:36:46.567
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a bit of an image problem.

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:49.429
[SPEAKER_07]: People will see it and think it's a kids game.

01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:54.992
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as I know, I think that Papa Music actually has the biggest following in Japan above the other Bimani games.

01:36:55.232 --> 01:36:59.895
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not to say Konami can't put a little effort into Americanizing the game a little bit.

01:36:59.915 --> 01:37:02.517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I realize there's a lot of people who listen to this show that go...

01:37:03.837 --> 01:37:05.438
[SPEAKER_10]: at the thought of a game getting Americanized.

01:37:05.458 --> 01:37:06.619
[SPEAKER_10]: But think about it.

01:37:06.699 --> 01:37:09.981
[SPEAKER_10]: How did Guitar Hero and Rock Band become so successful?

01:37:10.001 --> 01:37:11.802
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the songs were very American.

01:37:12.142 --> 01:37:26.770
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if pop and music could invest the development time into maybe reinventing the interface to be a little more not so childish and getting some good American songs mixed in with the Japanese favorites, it could do well here.

01:37:28.011 --> 01:37:28.091
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

01:37:28.649 --> 01:37:28.889
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:37:29.089 --> 01:37:29.950
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, we've got to let you go.

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:31.191
[SPEAKER_10]: Just take a couple more calls.

01:37:31.211 --> 01:37:32.332
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I have another piece of cake?

01:37:32.472 --> 01:37:33.253
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course you can.

01:37:33.774 --> 01:37:35.035
[SPEAKER_09]: Nom, nom, nom, nom.

01:37:35.735 --> 01:37:36.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

01:37:37.057 --> 01:37:38.258
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Bobby, the cake was a lie.

01:37:38.958 --> 01:37:39.198
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:37:39.799 --> 01:37:40.179
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:42.041
[SPEAKER_10]: I hung up on him.

01:37:42.061 --> 01:37:42.682
[SPEAKER_09]: I hung up on Bobby.

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:43.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Cake is a pie.

01:37:43.642 --> 01:37:44.463
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Bobby's awesome.

01:37:44.523 --> 01:37:44.803
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:37:45.404 --> 01:37:47.766
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try to get maybe one more call.

01:37:47.806 --> 01:37:49.948
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any other last-minute stories here before we get to that?

01:37:52.634 --> 01:37:54.816
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Misty Well hello Misty, how are you?

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:19.698
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing good, even though I have to open in the morning, I'm still listening.

01:38:20.199 --> 01:38:21.519
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to hear about that.

01:38:21.539 --> 01:38:25.141
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here, just for you, I have a caffeinated orange piece of cake.

01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:27.063
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

01:38:27.343 --> 01:38:27.823
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

01:38:28.383 --> 01:38:28.984
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom.

01:38:30.425 --> 01:38:31.085
[SPEAKER_16]: Om, nom, nom.

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:31.705
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

01:38:32.426 --> 01:38:33.106
[SPEAKER_10]: She sounds so excited.

01:38:33.386 --> 01:38:36.328
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Misty, what question do you have for us tonight?

01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:43.352
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did Scope get screwed over tonight like it did way the hell back in episode 111?

01:38:45.202 --> 01:38:46.663
[SPEAKER_10]: Skulk That is an understatement It's better than dessert

01:39:16.155 --> 01:39:17.676
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had a band, I think I'd name it that.

01:39:17.736 --> 01:39:18.677
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better than dessert.

01:39:19.417 --> 01:39:20.318
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a lot of great band names.

01:39:20.598 --> 01:39:23.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners quickly before we shut off for the night?

01:39:26.342 --> 01:39:32.546
[SPEAKER_16]: Not really that I can think of, even though I bet I'm going to get my butt kicked for not asking another particular question.

01:39:32.946 --> 01:39:33.666
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

01:39:34.527 --> 01:39:35.948
[SPEAKER_16]: Another question you were supposed to ask?

01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:42.712
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanted me to ask about the fuck show.

01:39:44.237 --> 01:39:46.658
[SPEAKER_14]: The fuck show happens when no one expects it to happen.

01:39:46.679 --> 01:39:52.483
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the apocalypse.

01:39:53.544 --> 01:39:55.245
[SPEAKER_10]: The fuck show will sneak up on you eventually.

01:39:55.265 --> 01:39:56.206
[SPEAKER_10]: See, here's my problem.

01:39:56.446 --> 01:39:58.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I think we've hyped the fuck show too much.

01:39:59.268 --> 01:40:02.491
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's going to be that funny when it happens.

01:40:03.271 --> 01:40:06.614
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's one of those things where halfway through part A we're going to be like, okay, we need to stop.

01:40:06.634 --> 01:40:07.775
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, all right, fuck it.

01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:10.751
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see.

01:40:10.991 --> 01:40:13.052
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's what it's starting to seem like to me, too.

01:40:13.252 --> 01:40:17.814
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I'm a little worried about fuck show, but it will... The fuck show will happen when Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

01:40:19.935 --> 01:40:20.935
[SPEAKER_10]: We may hold her to that.

01:40:20.955 --> 01:40:21.495
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck is finally out.

01:40:21.635 --> 01:40:22.556
[SPEAKER_10]: We may hold her to that.

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.676
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Misty, take care of yourself.

01:40:24.716 --> 01:40:25.537
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, okay?

01:40:26.697 --> 01:40:27.477
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty, you too.

01:40:27.577 --> 01:40:28.558
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't fall asleep tomorrow.

01:40:28.838 --> 01:40:29.098
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:40:30.796 --> 01:40:31.537
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy fucking birthday to me.

01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:50.832
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy, indeed.

01:40:50.912 --> 01:40:51.793
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy fucking birthday to you.

01:40:51.813 --> 01:40:52.213
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy.

01:40:52.453 --> 01:40:52.834
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

01:40:53.594 --> 01:40:54.315
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, look at that.

01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:57.979
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov pulled the tail out from between his legs and came back into the studio just in time.

01:40:57.999 --> 01:40:59.820
[SPEAKER_10]: Look what the cat pissed on and dragged in.

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.462
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see that Bitmania got third place?

01:41:01.742 --> 01:41:02.443
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't deserve it.

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:02.863
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:41:05.066 --> 01:41:06.387
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Andrew's birthday.

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:08.949
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, fuck you, buddy.

01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:11.111
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for being here.

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:12.453
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be here next week, too, huh?

01:41:12.493 --> 01:41:12.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:15.095
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you'll be here for the Tommy Tallarico interview.

01:41:15.275 --> 01:41:15.896
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, goody.

01:41:16.456 --> 01:41:17.897
[SPEAKER_05]: I so like him.

01:41:18.358 --> 01:41:20.159
[SPEAKER_10]: Your final thought for tonight?

01:41:26.245 --> 01:41:27.186
[SPEAKER_05]: I like DJ Maxx.

01:41:29.087 --> 01:41:30.509
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought for tonight?

01:41:31.049 --> 01:41:32.010
[SPEAKER_13]: Reject false icons.

01:41:33.183 --> 01:41:35.426
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought for tonight, reject false MRIs.

01:41:35.826 --> 01:41:36.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

01:41:38.169 --> 01:41:42.775
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is, I was listening to some all games radios, well, you know, the streaming stuff.

01:41:43.136 --> 01:41:46.861
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of Tommy Tallarico music on there, on their playlist there.

01:41:46.881 --> 01:41:47.722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like,

01:41:48.162 --> 01:41:48.983
[SPEAKER_08]: Every few songs.

01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:50.543
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a friend of the station.

01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:50.984
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

01:41:51.384 --> 01:41:52.464
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's also done a lot of stuff.

01:41:52.604 --> 01:41:54.025
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just thought it was interesting.

01:41:54.065 --> 01:41:58.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, he gives express permission for his music to be played.

01:41:58.247 --> 01:42:00.969
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, they want to support people.

01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:02.089
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, not knocking anything.

01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:03.790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying it's an observation.

01:42:03.810 --> 01:42:05.431
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an observation.

01:42:06.638 --> 01:42:06.938
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:42:08.099 --> 01:42:14.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting as you have for the past six years, even when we weren't a podcast.

01:42:14.943 --> 01:42:18.025
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those that have joined us along the way, thank you so much.

01:42:18.806 --> 01:42:25.130
[SPEAKER_10]: As we push on to episode 300, our seventh year anniversary and beyond, we couldn't do it without you guys.

01:42:25.190 --> 01:42:25.790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:29.353
[SPEAKER_10]: And remember, if you enjoy what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell two friends.

01:42:30.093 --> 01:42:33.117
[SPEAKER_10]: about our show and it helps spread the word about independent radio.

01:42:33.177 --> 01:42:34.478
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave us a review on iTunes.

01:42:34.558 --> 01:42:38.722
[SPEAKER_10]: God, we could use some more of those five-star reviews and so on and so on.

01:42:40.144 --> 01:42:40.765
[SPEAKER_10]: All that good stuff.

01:42:41.185 --> 01:42:48.793
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you and good night and we'll see you next time, next week, Tommy Tallarico in episode number 285.

01:42:49.314 --> 01:42:50.235
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to lose count.

01:42:50.315 --> 01:42:51.616
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you're old when you start losing count.

01:42:51.656 --> 01:42:52.077
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night.

01:42:52.745 --> 01:42:53.265
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

01:43:24.126 --> 01:43:24.375
[SPEAKER_02]: and more.
