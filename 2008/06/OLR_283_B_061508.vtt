00:00.000 --> 00:05.620
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.620 --> 00:11.620
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:11.620 --> 00:14.980
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:14.980 --> 00:19.320
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.980
And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio, here on All Games Radio,

00:22.980 --> 00:27.440
where we broadcast live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

00:27.440 --> 00:30.400
immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show, so sometimes it's a couple minutes early,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.040
sometimes it's a couple minutes late, as it was tonight.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.920
But that's alright, because we have some great shows that we play with here on All Games Radio,

00:36.920 --> 00:40.640
not just Bobby on Sunday nights, but a whole sort of assortment of different podcasts

00:40.640 --> 00:42.480
and other live shows that air throughout the week.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.280
So if you haven't checked it out yet, you definitely should, www.allgames.com.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.400
Meanwhile, we got some other gaming news to get into, and we're gonna get into that in just a minute,

00:50.400 --> 00:54.160
but we gotta follow up with some of that hilarity from the Part A,

00:54.160 --> 00:57.720
or I guess I shouldn't say hilarity, because somebody is gonna get yelled at

00:57.720 --> 01:01.320
over all those game news things getting leaked out.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.760
Loke, you were doing some poking around on the website.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.400
What kind of stuff were you looking at there during the break?

01:05.400 --> 01:07.840
Well, I was just trying to, you know, pull up a bunch of...

01:07.840 --> 01:09.120
What's the name of these guys again?

01:09.120 --> 01:09.960
The Marketing Research...?

01:09.960 --> 01:11.000
Intellisponse.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.120
Okay, Intellisponse.

01:12.120 --> 01:12.880
Intellisponse.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.360
But I thought it was funny, though, because they have...

01:15.360 --> 01:20.840
There was a section on the NeoGAF forum that they were...

01:20.840 --> 01:26.000
Someone had highlighted their privacy policy, and it's all the policy.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.640
Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority.

01:29.640 --> 01:34.680
We have taken careful measures to secure your information.

01:34.680 --> 01:35.320
Whoops.

01:35.320 --> 01:40.840
We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from PC to our servers.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.560
Our secure server software encrypts information,

01:43.560 --> 01:48.560
ensuring that all internet transactions remain private.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.320
That's gotta be so embarrassing, though.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.280
That's gotta be so embarrassing.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.680
So stupid.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.720
Yeah, they have, like...

01:53.720 --> 01:59.160
Yeah, it is secure, and it will prompt for a password and stuff like that.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.200
But if you remove part of the URL on that, it won't...

02:03.200 --> 02:05.200
So...

02:05.200 --> 02:07.400
It's broken.

02:07.400 --> 02:07.960
But...

02:07.960 --> 02:09.800
Yeah, somebody's gonna get screamed out over that.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.120
Lots of stuff, and we'll talk about it a little bit more later on.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.200
I'd be curious to see if this company makes a statement,

02:14.200 --> 02:15.760
or if they just try to pretend it didn't happen.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.080
I think they're just gonna pretend it didn't happen,

02:18.080 --> 02:20.880
and let Microsoft and Activision kind of...

02:20.880 --> 02:23.280
And all the other marketing research companies today are going,

02:23.280 --> 02:24.480
Woo-hoo!

02:24.480 --> 02:26.440
New business is gonna be coming soon.

02:26.440 --> 02:26.760
Yeah.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.600
Alright, let's stop kicking sand in these guys' faces,

02:29.600 --> 02:31.840
and go back to gaming news.

02:31.840 --> 02:32.960
Yes.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.880
Alright.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.520
So, there's some interesting things coming out this week in Japan.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.400
I don't really know what you'd call this press event,

02:40.400 --> 02:43.200
but it was basically the event where Microsoft says,

02:43.200 --> 02:46.560
Hey, look at all the Japanese RPGs that are coming our way.

02:46.560 --> 02:54.440
So, one of which, of course, is a really cool Star Ocean 4,

02:54.440 --> 02:59.280
which will be making its way out to the Xbox 360 in 2009.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.000
It's called Star Ocean The Last Hope,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.280
and they had a trailer also being released for that,

03:05.280 --> 03:09.200
and of course it's Square Enix and Tri-Aces RPG.

03:09.200 --> 03:16.880
And I guess apparently the game was announced back in 2007

03:16.880 --> 03:21.360
at the Square Enix party, but, you know, I don't know.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.080
And it was funny, too,

03:22.080 --> 03:25.600
because originally it was supposed to be a PS3 exclusive,

03:25.600 --> 03:28.880
but no word yet on when it's gonna arrive on the PS3,

03:28.880 --> 03:32.160
or if it will.

03:32.160 --> 03:32.960
If it will?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.720
That's an interesting little footnote.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.440
Do you think that possibly...

03:35.440 --> 03:36.640
Well, I added that, so...

03:36.640 --> 03:38.960
Okay.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.280
Well, I mean, this is a Microsoft press event.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.960
They're not gonna say, oh, it's also on PS3.

03:42.960 --> 03:43.840
Ah, yes, it makes sense.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.120
I think it's still coming to PS3,

03:45.120 --> 03:46.720
probably about the same time frame

03:46.720 --> 03:48.640
as a lot of these types of games do.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.160
There's another role-playing game coming out

03:50.160 --> 03:52.400
called Tales of Vesperia is coming out,

03:52.400 --> 03:55.600
and it's coming out in Japan in August of 2008,

03:55.600 --> 03:56.400
August 7th specifically.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.520
And the US, too.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.040
Is it coming out the US the same time?

03:59.040 --> 03:59.840
Around the same time.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.120
Around the same time, but we don't have...

04:01.120 --> 04:02.240
It'll also be mid-August.

04:03.040 --> 04:03.760
Is it really?

04:03.760 --> 04:04.960
Yeah, so far.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.560
That wasn't part of this press release.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.000
Do you know something I don't?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.080
Oh, I know that it's coming out mid-August.

04:10.080 --> 04:10.480
All right.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.480
I don't remember the exact date,

04:12.480 --> 04:13.600
but it's coming out mid-August.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.800
It still looks pretty cool.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.640
It's a Namco Bandai RPG,

04:16.640 --> 04:19.360
which I believe Eternal Sonata was by them as well.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.920
And that game was kind of one of those games

04:21.920 --> 04:23.360
that slipped under some people's radars,

04:23.360 --> 04:24.800
but it's great.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.000
It's a great game.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.160
So I'm hoping this game follows in that.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.280
It's gonna be 37,800 yen for the bundle,

04:34.240 --> 04:35.360
because the game is actually gonna get

04:35.360 --> 04:37.440
its own Xbox 360 bundle over in Japan

04:37.440 --> 04:39.440
to try and tap into that market

04:39.440 --> 04:42.720
that just won't pick up on Xbox 360.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.760
The Japanese are really resistant to Xbox 360,

04:45.760 --> 04:47.760
but trying to use some of these upcoming role-playing games,

04:47.760 --> 04:49.040
which all look pretty rad,

04:49.760 --> 04:51.760
to try and woo some of the Japanese players

04:51.760 --> 04:53.600
over to Xbox 360.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.120
Hasn't worked so far.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.520
Yeah, and I have a feeling they're all too busy

04:57.520 --> 04:59.600
playing Metal Gear Solid 4 to care this week,

04:59.600 --> 05:00.560
sorry to say.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.160
Well, another game that...

05:02.160 --> 05:02.660
But I'll buy it.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.720
Okay.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.920
Oh, another game that Squenix published

05:09.440 --> 05:12.400
is actually developed by Tri-Ace for Xbox 360.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.040
Infinite Undiscovery has ship dates

05:17.040 --> 05:19.840
for North America and Europe,

05:19.840 --> 05:21.920
being 9.2 and 9.5, respectively,

05:21.920 --> 05:27.200
and proposed in-store dates of September 11th

05:27.200 --> 05:28.880
for Japan and Asia.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.880
So you can read about it if you read Japanese on Famitsu.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.840
Oh, by the way, this was like my favorite

05:35.840 --> 05:37.280
out of all those role-playing games I saw,

05:37.280 --> 05:38.480
this Infinite Undiscovery.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.360
This looks pretty sweet.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.880
And the name is very interesting.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.920
It's really weird that we're getting it before Japan.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.440
It's shipping on that day.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.240
But, well, it's so gonna be there next day.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.600
I'll still be able to walk into a store

05:51.600 --> 05:55.280
and get it before the Japanese listener person,

05:55.280 --> 05:57.760
which is strange because with role-playing games,

05:57.760 --> 05:59.600
I can't think of many times that happens.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.480
So, but that's, I mean, it's not that much.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.360
It's only like a week.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.240
But I think it's pretty cool.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.680
They at least obviously develop the games at the same time.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.240
Yes.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.040
Pretty neat.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.400
And then the last game, of course,

06:10.400 --> 06:12.160
which we've seen a little bit of trailers on,

06:12.160 --> 06:15.440
I think during E3 and maybe Tokyo Game Show.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.320
I don't remember.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.400
But the last title, of course,

06:18.400 --> 06:22.000
The Last Remnant will be getting an Xbox 360 release.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.760
This is the one that's using the Unreal 3 engine

06:25.760 --> 06:29.200
that was first announced in 2007.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.520
And the game is supposed to be, I guess,

06:33.520 --> 06:35.440
supposed to be launching simultaneously

06:35.440 --> 06:38.320
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan,

06:39.200 --> 06:43.360
North America and Europe, I guess, a little bit later.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.520
But now it looks like they're gonna get

06:45.520 --> 06:51.280
a simultaneous worldwide launch in all three territories.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.680
So it's supposed to come sometime this winter.

06:56.160 --> 06:56.800
Interesting.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.640
Interesting, so coming soon is basically what they've said.

07:00.640 --> 07:00.960
The fall.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.240
Interesting.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.840
Hey, I'm actually curious because I

07:03.840 --> 07:06.400
know a lot of our listeners are into these RPG-type games

07:06.400 --> 07:07.200
because we are.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.360
I'm kind of curious, chat room, out of these games

07:09.360 --> 07:12.320
we just talked about, Star Ocean, Tales of Vesperia,

07:12.320 --> 07:14.240
Infinite Undiscovery, Last Remnant,

07:14.240 --> 07:17.120
is there any that, and kind of including other RPGs

07:17.120 --> 07:19.280
we know are in the tailpipe for Xbox 360,

07:19.280 --> 07:21.440
such as Blue Dragon 2, I think, has been confirmed,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.360
as well as the Lost Odyssey sequel.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.680
I'm kind of curious, those of you guys in chat,

07:25.680 --> 07:28.400
are any of these catching your interest?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.560
And if so, which one?

07:30.560 --> 07:31.360
And why?

07:32.960 --> 07:35.120
Which one do you think you're more interested in

07:35.120 --> 07:35.680
over the others?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.520
I already have Infinite Undiscovery on order,

07:37.520 --> 07:39.040
same with Tales.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.440
And then there's also the PS3 Sega one

07:41.440 --> 07:45.120
that's coming out that I can't remember the name off

07:45.120 --> 07:46.400
the top of my head right now.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.200
But that one I also have on order.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.280
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you

07:51.280 --> 07:53.360
want to join in on the instant discussion there.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.760
If you're listening live to us on this Sunday evening.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.840
As well as five copies of Saints Row 2

07:57.840 --> 08:00.160
for each one of our Xbox 360s.

08:00.160 --> 08:00.660
Nice.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.640
We'll move, we'll move.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.140
Huh?

08:04.640 --> 08:06.000
You asked a question of us.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.000
Oh, I was asking chat, but certainly

08:10.000 --> 08:11.840
if you have an opinion too, please.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.720
I'm sort of thinking that Infinite Undiscovery,

08:14.720 --> 08:16.800
but it depends on if I have time.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.200
Always depends on time.

08:19.200 --> 08:19.700
That's all right.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.720
We'll go back to that question in just a minute.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.520
Let me address this though related to Xbox stories.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.280
Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.360
The Xbox Live Arcade game with the longest freaking title ever.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.800
You know it's going into beta.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.760
And the beta was purchased through Commando 3,

08:37.760 --> 08:40.160
which just went on Xbox Live Arcade this past week.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.000
That beta is going to open up on June 25th.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.280
That would be next Wednesday is when

08:47.280 --> 08:48.560
this beta is going to go live.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.160
Now remember about the beta though,

08:50.160 --> 08:53.200
you only basically get Ken Ryu in one stage.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.840
So it's not really a whole lot to the game.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.640
But hey, at least you do get to take a peek

08:58.640 --> 09:00.560
at what this game is going to look like.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.520
So again, that all starts on June 25th.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.680
Going to the question that I asked earlier,

09:07.680 --> 09:09.440
looking in chat at some of the answers here.

09:10.480 --> 09:10.880
Let's see.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.120
Joshi16 says, I don't have the time anymore.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.720
I want to try Eternal Sonata.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.920
I'm so behind.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm behind on a lot of these games

09:18.000 --> 09:18.560
too.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.120
Damn wow.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.520
GameGuru says, OLR, not really.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.720
Maybe the Blue Dragon games because Blue Dragon

09:24.720 --> 09:26.320
is from Team Chrono Trigger.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.280
I got to tell you though, the first Blue Dragon game,

09:30.960 --> 09:32.560
not what you would have hoped for.

09:33.200 --> 09:33.760
It's OK.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.440
It's like imagine like a Super Nintendo classic RPG

09:37.440 --> 09:38.880
on an Xbox 360.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.400
That's kind of what Blue Dragon was.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.440
But unfortunately, the story was a little generic

09:43.440 --> 09:45.680
as a lot of RPGs tended to be back then.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.960
So sorry.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.040
All right, that was really it.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.960
We didn't get a whole lot of comments on that in chat.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.200
Ospher says he wants to get a Eternal Sonata for PS3.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.960
I guess they do have the extra stuff.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.520
So we'll see.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.880
I wish I hadn't looked at this.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.080
I really wish I hadn't looked at this.

10:02.080 --> 10:02.720
Well, what's that?

10:04.720 --> 10:07.440
I'm not going to spoil it for anybody else at all.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.600
And actually, this really isn't that bad of a spoiler.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.440
But I'm still not going to say anything about it

10:11.440 --> 10:16.400
because there is a voice acting casting call out

10:16.400 --> 10:18.160
for a second Portal game.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.120
I'm not going to say anything about it.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.400
So we don't know what it is or why.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.280
It's just it's out there.

10:25.280 --> 10:25.920
I know why.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.880
I know what it is now.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.920
But it's a spoilery.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.600
I don't want to spoil it for anybody.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.080
All right.

10:30.080 --> 10:36.320
If you want to know, you can actually hunt it down on a...

10:36.320 --> 10:38.480
I'm not in most gaming blogs around the story this week.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.200
But I'm not sure.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.520
I'm not going to ruin it.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.440
I got to say, though, that the premise sounds awesome.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.240
From what I read of it, it sounds very interesting.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.120
You knew it was coming.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.960
You knew a Portal 2 had to happen somehow.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.480
So I'm glad they will make it work one way or the other.

10:57.360 --> 10:57.840
We'll see.

10:59.280 --> 10:59.680
All right.

11:02.480 --> 11:06.880
Anyways, so there's some interesting stuff coming out.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.320
Now, probably from a very unlikely event as well.

11:10.960 --> 11:18.400
The Major League of Gaming, they actually had a Halo 3 competition that's happened recently.

11:18.400 --> 11:24.320
And one of the surprises that they had for their contestants was a new map for Halo 3

11:24.320 --> 11:25.760
called Cold Storage.

11:25.760 --> 11:34.720
And what Cold Storage is, is actually a remake or, I guess, a map that resembles the Chill

11:34.720 --> 11:36.960
Out level from the first Halo games.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.800
So it's kind of interesting.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.560
It kind of falls in line with, you know, the other maps that have been released.

11:42.560 --> 11:48.960
Kind of a lot of remakes and that, I guess, inspired by previous game maps and stuff like

11:48.960 --> 11:49.360
that.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.920
So no word on when this will be coming to us, but probably something like in the fall

11:53.920 --> 11:56.400
or summer, you know, another map pack.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.400
But pretty cool.

12:00.080 --> 12:00.560
All right.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.960
Sounds interesting.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.600
Although, I'm kind of over Halo 3.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.280
I don't know about the rest of y'all.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.040
But Halo 3 didn't have the lasting power that Halo 2 did, sadly.

12:12.080 --> 12:12.880
I don't know.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.680
All right.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.200
The Maw is a new game that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.320
And I don't know, the first time I look at this and I see this little creature in a little

12:20.320 --> 12:24.400
screenshot from the Maw, I think it's like something I see out of Spore or something.

12:24.400 --> 12:32.160
But actually, what Maw is, is that is kind of the little mouth creature on a pet blob

12:32.160 --> 12:33.440
that is featured in the game.

12:34.320 --> 12:40.080
You can actually use this little creature to eat, like, a house or just lots of little

12:40.080 --> 12:40.560
different things.

12:40.560 --> 12:40.880
I don't know.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.360
It kind of sounds different, like Katamari Dimashius in a way.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.480
It's a little alien, Frank.

12:46.480 --> 12:50.640
And you use the Maw's growth and the power's M-A-W.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.360
Thought so.

12:51.360 --> 12:51.860
Yeah.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.960
And basically, what you do, you say hello to creatures, then eat them.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.560
And they double as power ups.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.760
Twisted Pixel is the people behind the game.

13:01.760 --> 13:06.480
And they promise that they will have a lengthy single player mode, cut scenes that are described

13:06.480 --> 13:11.840
as intense, and cutting edge graphics for Xbox Live Arcade.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.440
No word on when this will be out.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.520
Hopefully a little sooner than Castle Crashers.

13:16.960 --> 13:17.360
We'll see.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.720
Meanwhile, let's take a look at what you guys have to say in our mailbag.

13:22.720 --> 13:28.240
Every week we open up our mailbag to you guys to send us your emails and your love and adoration

13:28.240 --> 13:29.200
or your hate mail.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.240
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.680
Darkstalker's going to dive in right now.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.640
Pick a few of her favorites.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.680
Read them for you.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.000
We got a bunch of them, but they're not that long.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.500
OK.

13:39.440 --> 13:44.480
First one comes from, I'm just going to say James.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.640
Is there a date on how long Deoxys is available?

13:48.640 --> 13:54.320
I'm in Germany, and my cartridge is in Texas to get the event item for Darkrai.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.840
So, I may need to ask someone to take the cartridge to Gamestop.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.960
Um, I didn't see.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.240
I don't remember seeing one either.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.960
I will try to find the answer for the reason next to the email.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.280
You may have to get a friend over here to get it for you or something somehow.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.200
This one comes from our friend in Kenya.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.000
Hi, O.R. I've been listening to tonight's show and I'm thrilled you read my email.

14:18.000 --> 14:18.560
Wait, no.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.360
This guy's fake.

14:19.360 --> 14:19.920
I proved it.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.920
He's on our Facebook community.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.520
OK. The actual name that emailed us.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.560
I got you.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.520
I caught you.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.960
So, now I want to know what the hell, what is this?

14:28.960 --> 14:29.920
Go ahead and read the email.

14:29.920 --> 14:30.480
I'm going to read it.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.920
That's what I said because I'm, you know.

14:31.920 --> 14:32.480
All right.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.080
It's like, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to prove who I am, but I will try and find a

14:36.080 --> 14:39.280
way to get a hold of the camera to take a picture of Samara's Cafe.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.560
Have a good night there in the USA from Kenya.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.440
That's from Taiwan.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.040
I just want to know, what the hell is this?

14:47.840 --> 14:48.960
Just come clean.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.680
I caught you.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.800
You're, you're, the name in your email is in our Facebook community.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.920
You got caught.

14:55.920 --> 14:56.720
Now admit it.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.280
All right.

14:57.280 --> 14:57.920
Next email.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.480
But I still want to see the picture.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.320
I mean, I kind of want to see what you, what we're going to do.

15:03.520 --> 15:09.520
I mean, I, I, I, I don't have a, this one comes from the guy with cool email.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.000
Salt-Tec.

15:11.440 --> 15:15.920
Just wondering if any of you know whether Sony ever plans to let you play PSP games

15:15.920 --> 15:17.760
using your PS3 via remote play.

15:17.760 --> 15:22.000
I hate the PSP's control, but it seems all the games I like are coming out for it, i.e.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.880
Kingdom Hearts 3, God of War 3, Final Fantasy 7.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.400
It just seems like it would be smart because it's only, only take an update to do.

15:30.400 --> 15:34.560
And I know personally that a few of my friends would pick up both the PS3 and PSP just to

15:34.560 --> 15:38.640
do this and the others, since they already have a PS3, would just buy the PSP.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.760
He means Crisis Core.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.720
That's what I meant.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.040
Yeah.

15:41.040 --> 15:41.840
That's what I was thinking.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.480
Awesome show, never let it stop.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.040
Salt-Tec.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.960
Awesome show, never let it stop, Salt-Tec.

15:49.600 --> 15:49.840
Okay.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.080
So, wait, wait, was the question, should he get the PSP or?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.560
If they're ever gonna have the remote play.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.800
Oh, remote play on PSP.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.440
I thought they already had something like that.

16:01.440 --> 16:06.160
I think he's talking about in the other direction where you can play PSP games on your PS3.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.680
Oh, um, maybe someday.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.560
You know what would be a little bit better is, well,

16:12.560 --> 16:16.000
I guess you could emulate it, but like, that'd be kind of cool.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.200
They have a little $20 peripheral or something like that that just pop the UMD into and play

16:21.200 --> 16:21.680
it that way.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.680
Well, here's, here's the other thing on those new PSPs.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.960
They have the video out, which is essentially playing them on your TV anyway.

16:26.960 --> 16:27.760
That's not exactly.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.000
The complaint was about the controller.

16:30.880 --> 16:35.600
I can understand that and maybe Sony will do that whole like compatibility and reverse

16:35.600 --> 16:40.400
thing, but because of the video out and because Sony doesn't feel that their controller sucks,

16:40.400 --> 16:41.600
don't hold your breath.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.640
Sorry, by the way, I'm looking at a story about that Pokemon event to go back to the

16:46.640 --> 16:47.200
last email.

16:47.920 --> 16:52.480
It says that it's only on the weekends of June 20th and June 27th.

16:52.480 --> 16:57.280
I'm sorry to say June 30th, I think is the last day that this is available.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.000
So sorry to our friend in Germany.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You'll have to get somebody over here to get it for you.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.600
Quick FedEx your cartridge out here or find a cheat code or something.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.640
Yeah, sorry.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.160
Um, this comes from Geek Boy.

17:08.160 --> 17:13.680
Hey, OLR crew, I've been looking unsuccessfully for free lessons in programming languages.

17:13.680 --> 17:19.520
I've wanted to learn how to learn programming languages for some time now, and I wanted

17:19.520 --> 17:22.160
to know if you knew any good websites and which languages I should learn.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.040
Thanks, Geek Boy.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.240
Well, you can learn to learn anything, I suppose.

17:28.240 --> 17:36.160
But if you want to start off, you know, easy, try something like, you know, Visual Basic,

17:36.160 --> 17:39.680
maybe because you can use that in Word and all kinds of other programs.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.160
You know what?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.800
If you ain't writing in ZZT, you ain't shit.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.480
I'm just kidding.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.840
No, you need to learn Fortran.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.760
Jeez, Pascal.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.480
How about Logo?

17:54.560 --> 17:55.360
No, just kidding.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.520
You know, here's the thing.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.120
Honestly, if you really want to start with programming, like if you don't even really

18:01.120 --> 18:03.920
have your foot, because he says he doesn't really have his foot in the door at all.

18:03.920 --> 18:10.160
I don't like free C. Well, not even that, but my suggestion go to one of these games

18:10.160 --> 18:11.440
that is a make your own game.

18:11.440 --> 18:17.040
And even though I kind of joke about ZZT, that game will teach you a lot about programming,

18:17.040 --> 18:18.480
even though it's like years old.

18:18.480 --> 18:24.000
And a lot of these games that are game maker type games, it's a really good place to start

18:24.000 --> 18:29.280
because programming and all that is a lot about logic and a way of thinking and debugging

18:29.280 --> 18:29.840
your stuff.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.200
I know it's logical.

18:31.200 --> 18:36.240
I hey, look, when I originally went to college, I was studying originally like computer programming

18:36.240 --> 18:38.400
and I started with a C++ class.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.680
I hated it.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.440
And I decided this is not for me.

18:41.440 --> 18:47.600
I quit database management because as soon as I went through the basic stuff, I was like,

18:47.600 --> 18:48.160
I hate this.

18:49.120 --> 18:53.840
There's a lot of people in chat yelling C++, Java, C, basic.

18:54.960 --> 18:59.760
I would say honestly, I don't know who uses basic anymore, but why not?

18:59.760 --> 19:02.080
But here's the thing.

19:02.080 --> 19:07.920
Start with one of these game maker type programs that teach you how to think logically and

19:07.920 --> 19:09.280
debug your games.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.680
Then you're ready to start with a programming language.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.240
Think about it.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.040
And seriously, check out ZZT.

19:15.040 --> 19:15.520
It rocks.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.560
Xenocore says turn him to game maker seven.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.320
Make a game while you learn coding techniques.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.760
That's exactly the kind of thing I'm thinking is a good starting point because if you try

19:23.760 --> 19:27.040
to just jump in and learn C, you're going to be in over your head, buddy.

19:27.040 --> 19:32.720
Yeah, you've got to have the, you always build up to whatever.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.120
Yeah.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.160
And Alpha Canagram says TI-83 basic for the win.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.760
Hell yeah, I had one.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.080
I had the Texas Instruments computer that had the little cartridges that you slid on

19:42.080 --> 19:42.800
the side.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.560
And I had the basic book.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.080
I will write you a Commodore 64 basic program right now.

19:48.080 --> 19:48.560
Here we go.

19:49.120 --> 19:55.440
10 space, print space, quote, Rob is awesome, quote, enter.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.520
20 space, go to 10, enter, run.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.560
Programming lesson here on OLR.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.920
Make sure you've got plenty of printer paper.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.200
Exactly.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.640
You know, I have that icon, though.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.560
Did you see my icon that I made a long time ago?

20:11.280 --> 20:14.080
This is a 10 home.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.360
Yes, sweet home.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.840
30 go to 10.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.960
Yeah, I remember that.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.460
Yeah.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.160
Anyway, this one comes from Katamari's Forever.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.560
First of all, I want to thank you, OLR, for naming Space Channel 5 your classic game of

20:28.560 --> 20:29.520
the week last week.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.680
I was beaming with excitement when Jamie said those words.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.160
I actually thank Sauce for that because she's the one who told me to do it.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.040
Thank you, Sauce.

20:37.040 --> 20:37.520
Thank you.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.760
Even though you're not listening to us to watch Tony Awards.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.640
She didn't hear that now because she's watching Tony Awards.

20:43.680 --> 20:47.760
Second, I want to give a shout out to an OLR me, Carizzle.

20:48.480 --> 20:52.320
It's nice that I found him on another forum, Red Flag Deals.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.760
Do you get excited when you see a random OLR me around an event?

20:57.040 --> 20:57.540
Yeah.

20:58.400 --> 21:06.720
And by the way, this reminds me, I finally got around to making a character on the Ragnarok

21:06.720 --> 21:08.880
server that you have to guess which one I'm playing on.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.960
Named Dark Sakura with the party OLR me.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.880
So if you find me, you get a prize.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.640
I'm not going to tell you where I am, though.

21:15.280 --> 21:15.840
Nice.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.640
Only a few people know.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.040
And third, remember when someone nuked your article from Wikipedia?

21:21.040 --> 21:24.960
I was laughing out loud when I found out that under the beautiful Katamari article was none

21:24.960 --> 21:29.280
other than you, OLR, when the article referenced the story you posted about the game.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.160
I guess you're in place.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.200
Oh, yeah, that.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.520
I guess you're in places you think you're not in.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.280
Anyway, wanted to say I'm playing Space Channel 5 Part 2 now and talk to you later.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.480
Katamari's forever.

21:38.480 --> 21:38.980
Hey, yes.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.720
Go ahead.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.360
Rob.

21:41.360 --> 21:41.860
What?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.400
Remember that Still Alive parody thread?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.880
Well, I finished the song and put it on this email.

21:46.880 --> 21:47.360
Please listen.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.920
It would be greatly appreciated or maybe put in a bonus segment.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.360
How about we make that our fortune cookie?

21:51.360 --> 21:54.480
We or well, better yet was so the podcast listeners can hear it.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.240
We will play at the end of the show tonight because I did listen to it.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.320
I can't believe somebody actually did it.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.520
So we will definitely play it at the end of the show and you rock for doing it.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.760
Here's what I want to ask about Wikipedia.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.480
You know, not only were we linked from that beautiful Katamari article,

22:08.480 --> 22:11.040
we were also linked from the Guitar Hero 80s edition article.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.280
I don't even remember why what we had to do with that game.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.400
I guess we were.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.920
Did we announce it early or something?

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
I don't remember Guitar Hero 80s edition.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.760
What about 80s edition?

22:19.760 --> 22:22.160
We're linked from the article in Wikipedia.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.320
Like, for some reason, we're referenced in the article.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.040
I don't remember why.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.960
I think we may talk about it or whatever.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.460
Whatever.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.040
Here's my question.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.840
Did anyone ever try to recreate the wiki article?

22:31.840 --> 22:32.720
They should.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.760
I think so, too.

22:33.760 --> 22:38.400
The problem, the reason why it got nuked is because they said it wasn't sourced or that

22:41.040 --> 22:42.560
it didn't prove its relevance or whatever.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.320
But dude, we're coming up on our sixth birthday.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.600
We're gonna be like one of the longest running shows on the net, right?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.240
Right.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.080
Oh, you're giving me a second, yep, I found it.

22:50.080 --> 22:50.960
It's under history.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.080
Guitar Hero Encore Rock C80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar

22:58.080 --> 22:59.600
Hero 1980s edition.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.120
Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an

23:03.120 --> 23:06.960
Activision announcement, though no other source has cited this announcement.

23:06.960 --> 23:12.480
Activision officially revealed the first details of the game as May 11th, 2007, in addition

23:12.480 --> 23:15.760
to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rock C80s.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.640
I rem- you know what, it never came out, though, in that time.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.920
I remember what it was, though.

23:19.920 --> 23:26.560
It was some type of, like, sales presentation thing that you- that you had that we- I remember

23:26.560 --> 23:27.120
that's what it was.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.320
That's why no one else would have had it.

23:29.520 --> 23:29.760
Yeah.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.240
It was from, uh, I remember what it was from.

23:32.240 --> 23:38.560
It was from, uh, Destination PlayStation because that's, uh, it's retailers only.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.040
No press.

23:39.920 --> 23:40.320
Uh-huh.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.400
This one goes for the World of Warcraft players.

23:45.040 --> 23:45.600
Yay!

23:45.600 --> 23:47.440
From Lord Katakos.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.320
What server you guys play WoW on?

23:51.040 --> 23:55.920
Also, my 77 priest I mailed you about, like, two months ago was hacked, but I restarted

23:55.920 --> 24:01.280
on a private server called D- Dagon MS, I guess, and I'm now level 168.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.760
Wait, you can't be that high in WoW.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.560
Are you sure this is about WoW, or is this, uh, R- uh, Ragnarok?

24:07.840 --> 24:08.640
Can you go to 168?

24:08.640 --> 24:09.680
No, maybe it is.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.960
No, this is what you play WoW on.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.360
You can't go to level 168 in WoW.

24:13.360 --> 24:13.860
Private server?

24:13.860 --> 24:15.940
Maybe on a private server.

24:15.940 --> 24:16.580
That's what he just said.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.620
He's playing on a private server.

24:17.620 --> 24:18.420
Oh.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.100
I'm gonna look this- the server up.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
Um, anyway, you guys are gladly set to rob.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.220
He only just finished Khara.

24:25.460 --> 24:29.540
Um, I would- I- we- I'm on the Ravencrest server on normal OLR.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.060
I don't play on a pirated server.

24:31.060 --> 24:35.220
Um, I play on Ravencrest because it sounds like Ravenclaw from Harry Potter.

24:35.220 --> 24:35.780
Horde side.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.900
Horde has cookies.

24:36.900 --> 24:41.540
Okay, I looked up, uh, Dagon MS, and it's a freaking, um, um, MapleStory.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.780
MapleStory?

24:45.620 --> 24:46.340
Get out of here!

24:47.460 --> 24:48.180
I'm just kidding.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.940
Jamie doesn't play MapleStory.

24:49.940 --> 24:50.440
The end.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.220
Help me don't play that.

24:53.220 --> 25:00.420
And, um, by the way, the, um, uh, OL Army Guild on WoW really isn't the OL Army Guild

25:00.420 --> 25:01.060
on WoW anymore.

25:01.060 --> 25:06.660
It's like, uh, Rob's offline friends and their friends playing in a guild.

25:06.660 --> 25:10.660
So, if you're going to join our guild, I'm all for having listeners in there because

25:10.660 --> 25:15.620
we still go by the, uh, OL Army creative, uh, don't be an asshole when you play games.

25:15.620 --> 25:19.460
But, um, you know, don't expect that you're going to run into a whole lot of other OLR

25:19.460 --> 25:20.180
listeners on there.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.300
But we have fun.

25:21.300 --> 25:25.940
If any- if anyone wants to find out, wants to, um, and it's only going to be a casual

25:25.940 --> 25:29.380
guild, I'm not going to let anyone else invite anyone who- unless I trust them.

25:29.380 --> 25:35.460
But, um, find me on, um, uh, what is that chat thing we use?

25:35.460 --> 25:36.340
IRC.

25:36.340 --> 25:36.980
There you go.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.340
And, um, I might tell you.

25:38.340 --> 25:43.300
Um, I want to point out, too, because this is in the Justin TV chat, going back to the,

25:43.300 --> 25:47.780
uh, kid who was asking about the programming languages, wanting to know more about where

25:47.780 --> 25:48.820
to start with that.

25:48.820 --> 25:54.420
Um, Akuma JP, who works for, like, you know, game companies in Japan, suggests, download

25:54.420 --> 25:56.420
the iPhone SDK.

25:56.420 --> 25:57.060
It's fun.

25:57.060 --> 25:57.940
Start from there.

25:57.940 --> 25:58.660
Not C, though.

25:59.380 --> 26:00.340
I didn't even think about that.

26:00.340 --> 26:02.500
There's that whole new, uh, development kit that iPhones got.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.700
I might get the Twitter thingy for it.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.500
That might be kind of fun.

26:05.540 --> 26:06.260
Good suggestion.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.180
It's actually officially supported now.

26:08.180 --> 26:08.820
Hmm.

26:08.820 --> 26:10.980
Okay, next email from Amplitude.

26:10.980 --> 26:11.860
Yes, please.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.620
Hey, OLR, Amplitude here.

26:14.660 --> 26:18.260
I'm listening to part B of this week's show at work, and the whole tangent on how awesome

26:18.260 --> 26:21.940
arcades used to really, uh, be really got me to start thinking.

26:21.940 --> 26:25.860
We, or at least those of us from that era, certainly can name some arcades that are on

26:25.860 --> 26:29.140
the decline, and what happened, but reminiscing will only get us so far.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.660
I feel like we never quite found an explanation for this.

26:32.660 --> 26:36.580
Can we point fingers at corporate America and say that things were brought, um, were

26:36.580 --> 26:38.980
bought out and consequently ambushed?

26:38.980 --> 26:42.100
But is anyone else looking at it from a different perspective?

26:42.100 --> 26:45.060
What about the kids that go to the arcades or lack thereof?

26:45.060 --> 26:48.660
Nowadays, if you were spotted at a local arcade, you're pegged as a gamer, and all the

26:48.660 --> 26:52.500
stereotypes are realized, and you begin to accumulate what can only be described as

26:52.500 --> 26:53.140
loser points.

26:54.260 --> 26:57.220
I don't know about you, but I remember when going to the arcade with your friends was

26:57.220 --> 26:58.100
the cool thing to do.

26:58.660 --> 27:03.060
I guess my main point is that while arcades have gone downhill because of buyouts, no

27:03.060 --> 27:06.500
one goes to them anymore, and perhaps that's the reason why they're losing interest in

27:06.500 --> 27:07.220
being shut down.

27:07.780 --> 27:10.100
Sorry for the long email slash rant amplitude.

27:10.100 --> 27:10.420
P.S.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.180
This email brought to you by subject hometown here, home of the test subject here.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.780
Um, I see what you did there.

27:17.780 --> 27:19.300
Uh, good thought.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.580
I, I don't know.

27:20.580 --> 27:24.100
I don't think we ever did get down to the bottom of what happened to arcades, and I,

27:24.740 --> 27:26.740
there was money to be made in birthday parties.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.900
Maybe we should do our first investigative story.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.220
An invest, an OLR investigative report.

27:31.220 --> 27:31.700
Don't don't.

27:31.700 --> 27:32.740
Seriously.

27:32.740 --> 27:33.380
Maybe.

27:33.380 --> 27:33.940
We should.

27:33.940 --> 27:38.420
Okay, Jamie, you head that up because I wouldn't even know where to begin to college and works

27:38.420 --> 27:39.220
full time.

27:39.220 --> 27:42.180
Rob works full time and Rob has other things going on too.

27:42.180 --> 27:42.500
Okay.

27:42.500 --> 27:48.500
You know, so don't you were full time and is very busy with other things.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.060
You're not me.

27:49.940 --> 27:50.500
Get on that.

27:51.220 --> 27:51.620
All right.

27:51.620 --> 27:53.620
There's a shiny dollar in it for you.

27:54.900 --> 28:00.340
I have a Susan B with your name on it, but, but I do want to one part of the email said

28:00.340 --> 28:02.580
people don't go because they're afraid of being a nerd.

28:02.580 --> 28:05.700
Uh, no, no, that can't be true of people.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.540
People are dorks because they go to arcades.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.100
I can't believe that's true.

28:10.740 --> 28:14.340
Loki Jamie and Loki Jamie and I would never have met if it wasn't for the arcade.

28:14.340 --> 28:19.300
I don't, of course, you know, then again, I got called a geek earlier this week, so

28:19.300 --> 28:22.980
I don't know by some guy who doesn't know you.

28:22.980 --> 28:28.900
I know I'm just being a bitch, but seriously, you know, it's like, I don't the hell with

28:28.900 --> 28:29.860
what they think.

28:29.860 --> 28:34.020
So what if they think you're a cheeseburger points out for programming languages, PHP,

28:34.020 --> 28:38.420
Python, C++, Java, Ruby, Pearl, and if you learn HTML, it will be easier.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.180
Like, okay, HTML is freaking easy.

28:43.860 --> 28:47.300
So we're almost done.

28:47.300 --> 28:47.700
Great.

28:48.500 --> 28:48.900
Hello.

28:48.900 --> 28:49.540
All right.

28:49.540 --> 28:51.860
It is Janai from Las Vegas.

28:51.860 --> 28:55.780
As of typing this email, I have returned from the video game live concert in Henderson,

28:55.780 --> 28:56.500
Nevada.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.100
It is a must see event.

28:58.100 --> 29:03.460
I wore my Professor Layton costume and gave people gold coins that noticed who I was dressed

29:03.460 --> 29:03.860
as.

29:03.860 --> 29:04.360
Nice.

29:05.060 --> 29:08.900
I was backstage for the costume contest, and even though I didn't win, I got to see Martin

29:08.900 --> 29:13.380
Leung, the famous piano player who played the Super Mario theme blindfolded on YouTube.

29:13.380 --> 29:16.740
I quickly said, I love your YouTube videos and you applied with a cool thank you.

29:16.740 --> 29:17.540
And that made my day.

29:18.100 --> 29:21.380
Awesome lighting, great music selection, both new and classic games.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.500
And Tommy Tallarico kept changing his clothes, which was strange.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.620
I give the show a solid 100% rating.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.180
If it's coming to your town or close by, you must see it.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.260
And yes, they have international dates this year.

29:33.860 --> 29:39.380
You know, I'm really glad you read that email because it gives me a chance to say we have

29:39.380 --> 29:42.260
a guest coming on the show, not next week, but the week after.

29:42.260 --> 29:45.460
He's going to be on the show on the 29th, Sunday, the 29th.

29:46.180 --> 29:49.780
Tommy Tallarico is going to be on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live.

29:49.780 --> 29:52.820
And I will ask him for you about why the wardrobe change.

29:52.820 --> 29:56.900
So, yeah, and we're going to, we're going to be asking him about the world tour and,

29:56.900 --> 29:59.460
uh, you know, what, what people can expect this year and all that fun stuff.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.940
And then all expenses paid tickets to see it overseas.

30:01.940 --> 30:07.300
Uh, I don't push it, but I know Tommy Tallarico will be here in two weeks.

30:07.300 --> 30:07.800
Sweet.

30:08.420 --> 30:09.540
Cheeseburger.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.620
I'm not reading your other email, but I'll read this one.

30:12.180 --> 30:13.860
It's about arcades.

30:13.860 --> 30:17.220
Hey guys, last week you talked about arcades and how cool they were.

30:17.220 --> 30:20.180
I am 14, so I've never really been in arcades.

30:20.180 --> 30:24.660
Sky said we have cool things in our generation, but we won't realize them until 20 years from now.

30:24.660 --> 30:28.660
I think we'll be telling our kids about this thing called internet radio, where everyone had a voice.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.100
At least I got some OLR.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.980
You know, that's a cute email.

30:32.980 --> 30:33.620
That is cute.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.940
It is a very good, nice email.

30:37.220 --> 30:38.020
Last one.

30:38.020 --> 30:38.500
Yes.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.940
By the way, just to answer the questions in chat, Tommy will not actually be here in studio

30:41.940 --> 30:44.340
because, you know, he has this whole video games live thing going on.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.460
He's also trying to do, um, he's going to be here in two weeks.

30:47.460 --> 30:53.860
Live thing going on, he's also trying to do, um, but he will take a little time to plug it on our show.

30:53.860 --> 30:54.180
Yes.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.820
Last one comes from our very good friend.

30:56.820 --> 30:57.380
Vandalous.

30:58.900 --> 30:59.380
Hooray.

30:59.380 --> 30:59.940
Miss you.

30:59.940 --> 31:00.660
Happy father's day.

31:00.660 --> 31:01.140
Vandalous.

31:01.140 --> 31:02.420
Happy father's day.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.900
He's got, I think I lost count.

31:04.900 --> 31:07.540
I have lost count of how many children Vandalous has.

31:07.540 --> 31:08.180
I think five.

31:08.740 --> 31:09.300
Yeah.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.100
It's at least five.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.540
Happy father's day.

31:11.540 --> 31:12.740
You've earned it.

31:12.740 --> 31:13.460
Yes, you have.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.260
Quite a bit.

31:14.260 --> 31:16.500
Several times over and we miss you.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.380
We really miss you.

31:17.380 --> 31:18.420
Come back and visit us soon.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.300
Mm hmm.

31:19.300 --> 31:22.820
Um, he says, um, Hey gang, it's, uh, Terry slash Vandalous.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.500
Um, I hope you're all doing well.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.020
I wanted to pass on a new story.

31:26.020 --> 31:33.300
I just blogged about in my weekend news job at www.hardocp.com.

31:33.300 --> 31:33.540
Yeah.

31:33.540 --> 31:34.260
Hard OCP.

31:34.900 --> 31:39.540
Um, it's about the U S army's new recruitment tactic, um, interactive centers.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.780
And he sent me a link to it.

31:41.780 --> 31:46.340
Um, and, but he continues with full-size mockups, Apache helicopter simulations.

31:46.340 --> 31:50.180
Look like America's army was just the beginning and tells us to take care.

31:50.180 --> 31:55.860
And actually, yeah, what it is, is, um, excuse me, they're having a recruitment center set

31:55.860 --> 32:01.700
up with simulators for full-scale, um, mockups of equipment and a gaming arena that uses,

32:01.700 --> 32:03.540
um, America's army.

32:03.540 --> 32:11.940
Um, so that instead of doing the whole, having a commercial to sell what you might happen,

32:11.940 --> 32:17.300
they actually have something that in fact is even quoted, um, from a major Larry Dillard,

32:17.300 --> 32:20.020
who's, um, a U S army marketing executive.

32:20.020 --> 32:24.900
He said the, um, the modeling command and control systems are like those used in Iraq.

32:24.900 --> 32:29.380
Um, they said, there's a, like we said earlier, there's an Apache simulator, um, for pilot

32:29.380 --> 32:34.900
and co-pilot, um, that uses the flight and weapon system, a black Hawk helicopter, um,

32:34.900 --> 32:40.180
that has four door gunner positions and, um, uh, armored Humvee vehicle simulator.

32:40.180 --> 32:44.740
So I think that's pretty, actually, I kind of want to do that myself.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.020
Humvee simulator.

32:46.020 --> 32:46.500
Yeah.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.100
With, um, turrets and that type of thing.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.620
It's, it just makes me think of that.

32:51.620 --> 32:52.100
What was that?

32:52.100 --> 32:55.380
You know, the army is innovative.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.220
They're very innovative at this stuff.

32:57.220 --> 32:57.940
They do their job.

32:57.940 --> 33:01.060
Well, that's all I can really say.

33:01.060 --> 33:02.340
Smart, smart folks there.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.380
And they're using that wonderful America's army.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.700
Wait, whatever happened to America's army?

33:07.700 --> 33:08.820
I think it's, oh yeah, that's right.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.340
That game sucks.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.700
Is it still going?

33:11.700 --> 33:13.780
It's got, it's got a cult following to it.

33:15.540 --> 33:15.940
All right.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.140
That it for mailbag?

33:19.140 --> 33:19.460
Yes.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.140
Mailbag orange lounge, radio.com.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.100
Let's get back to some news.

33:22.900 --> 33:23.620
Yes.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.540
And this is kind of funny though.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.420
Um, apparently there is a game.

33:28.420 --> 33:34.980
Someone noticed that's reusing oblivion's graphics and, uh, the game itself was called

33:34.980 --> 33:42.580
uh, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds weird anyways, and it is blatantly ripping off Elder

33:42.580 --> 33:43.380
Scrolls Oblivion.

33:43.380 --> 33:50.580
In fact, they had a screenshot, um, comparison and yeah, it's near identical except for maybe

33:50.580 --> 33:52.980
the fire effects are shittier than the other game.

33:53.540 --> 34:01.460
Um, no word, uh, uh, no word on what else, um, they may have stolen.

34:01.460 --> 34:05.540
Um, it says, uh, apparently also, oh, there are some updates to the story.

34:05.540 --> 34:10.340
Apparently also, um, they stole an environment from Thief Deadly Shadows as well.

34:11.300 --> 34:17.780
And, um, apparently Joystick just heard back from the US publisher Try Synergy who told

34:17.780 --> 34:22.820
them that the similarities between the two are striking, but we were just as shocked

34:22.820 --> 34:26.100
as anybody else and we put the line into Majestic.

34:26.100 --> 34:31.380
Um, we had no idea that any of this had been happening in, um, the game and things would

34:31.380 --> 34:32.820
have been different if we had known.

34:33.380 --> 34:36.100
And says, wait, Bethesda is making this game themselves?

34:36.100 --> 34:37.380
No, Majestic.

34:37.380 --> 34:38.260
It's Majestic.

34:39.060 --> 34:44.100
The Majestic is the company making the game and it's being published by some company called

34:44.100 --> 34:45.060
Try Synergy.

34:45.060 --> 34:49.140
Well, Majestic actually made a phone call to Bethesda and this is what they had to say.

34:49.140 --> 35:02.580
Anything you can do, I can do better, I can do anything better than you, no you can't, yes I can, no you can, yes I can, no you can, yes I can, yes I can, no, anything you can be.

35:02.580 --> 35:05.620
Except in this case, they actually can't do it that much better.

35:05.620 --> 35:06.180
No, they can't.

35:06.900 --> 35:09.860
And, uh, that's kind of funny though.

35:09.860 --> 35:15.700
I wonder what else they're gonna, um, it says they also think that the game stole some, um,

35:15.700 --> 35:22.100
artwork from Diablotube, um, a shield called the Wall of Eyeless or something.

35:22.100 --> 35:22.600
Nice.

35:23.300 --> 35:23.860
Very nice.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.500
So they're stealing from everybody.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
Moogan, like a Moogan type game.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.220
Doesn't it?

35:29.220 --> 35:34.020
They could do, you know, we should have like random X-type game emulator and then let you

35:34.020 --> 35:35.540
import whatever sprite or whatever the hell you want to do.

35:35.540 --> 35:39.300
Yo, that kind of stuff is like semi-okay if you're making like a fan game or something

35:39.300 --> 35:41.380
like that and maybe like Oblivion or something.

35:41.380 --> 35:44.420
Why don't they just call this game, hi, I stole this from other games?

35:44.420 --> 35:45.860
I don't know.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.180
Azaku says bullshit.

35:50.180 --> 35:53.540
Who the fuck was producing that game in green light at the copyrighted textures without

35:53.540 --> 35:54.420
consulting a lawyer?

35:56.100 --> 35:56.600
Hmm.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.340
Is it bullshit?

35:58.900 --> 35:59.780
Or is it the real deal?

36:00.420 --> 36:01.300
Only time will tell.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.660
Meanwhile, let's go back to some more gaming news.

36:07.300 --> 36:12.020
In the law world, two guys are suing EA.

36:12.020 --> 36:14.340
Hey, why would they sue EA?

36:14.340 --> 36:21.060
Well, it has to do with the NFL lockout, basically, that EA has put on everybody else because

36:21.060 --> 36:22.180
they have the rights.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.540
They've actually filed the suit in a Northern California court.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.060
It's a class action lawsuit.

36:28.340 --> 36:33.220
And they're saying that because of the NFL license, EA is engaging in, quote, blatantly

36:33.220 --> 36:38.020
anti-competitive conduct and they are seeking, quote, restitution and damages for those who

36:38.020 --> 36:42.900
purchased an EA football game since August of 2005, disgorgement of all profits made

36:42.900 --> 36:46.980
as a result of anti-competitive actions, and that the infringing agreements be declared

36:46.980 --> 36:48.100
null and void.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.260
They're suing the wrong people.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.700
They need to be suing the NFL, not EA.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.980
For signing it in the first place.

36:54.980 --> 37:01.620
NFL was the one saying, hey, the rights for our franchise are up for grabs, OK, and then

37:01.620 --> 37:03.540
EA happened to win the bid there.

37:03.540 --> 37:09.220
It's NFL's fault and not EA as much as I hate to say that.

37:09.220 --> 37:13.140
And for those of you that don't understand legal translation so much, we actually had

37:13.140 --> 37:17.380
somebody try to simplify this lawsuit for us and they translated it for us.

37:17.380 --> 37:17.860
Here it is.

37:18.660 --> 37:22.340
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.220
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

37:24.260 --> 37:25.300
There it is.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.580
That's what this lawsuit is all about.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.500
Anyhow, stories like this, I don't know about you guys, but whenever I hear about all these

37:32.500 --> 37:38.900
like type of like frivolous lawsuit type things, I get a little bit angsty and mad.

37:38.900 --> 37:41.380
And that always necessitates some FUs.

37:41.380 --> 38:02.340
To myself, I left my laptop at home and had to go back and get it.

38:02.340 --> 38:14.100
All right, Loki, FUs is the guy in front of me at Burger King, because apparently he didn't

38:14.100 --> 38:15.700
know what he wanted to order.

38:15.700 --> 38:20.500
And then he proceeded to order like half the menu because I was waiting behind him for

38:20.500 --> 38:26.020
like 10 minutes while he proceeded to wait for his food to be delivered to his car in

38:26.020 --> 38:28.020
about five to six bags.

38:28.020 --> 38:28.340
Nice.

38:28.900 --> 38:30.420
Yes, I love people.

38:30.420 --> 38:33.380
Oh, and he was smoking right there in front of the end of the window, too.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.260
Nice, which is awesome.

38:34.260 --> 38:34.820
He's a winner.

38:37.380 --> 38:42.500
Um, my FU of the week goes to the root canal I had on Thursday.

38:43.060 --> 38:43.380
Ow.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.420
Root canals are not fun.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.420
An FU to the fact that I think there's a problem with it.

38:50.420 --> 38:50.740
I don't know.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.420
I'm gonna have to see the dentist next week.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.380
FU to dentistry.

38:54.980 --> 38:55.860
That's my FU of the week.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.220
Let's get back to gaming news.

38:57.940 --> 38:58.820
Do we gotta?

38:58.820 --> 38:59.940
We gotta.

38:59.940 --> 39:00.260
Okay.

39:01.140 --> 39:02.260
Um, Penny Arcade.

39:03.780 --> 39:04.100
Cool.

39:05.380 --> 39:05.780
I think.

39:06.340 --> 39:06.980
Nope, I'm wrong.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.460
Oh, did you get ahead of yourself?

39:09.460 --> 39:09.940
Yeah.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.700
Penny Arcade coming up soon.

39:11.700 --> 39:11.940
Yes.

39:11.940 --> 39:12.820
Later in the program.

39:13.860 --> 39:14.500
Squeamix.

39:15.060 --> 39:15.300
Yes.

39:16.100 --> 39:23.860
Um, there actually is a trailer up for the new MMO concerto gate and it's going to be

39:23.860 --> 39:27.700
a free MMORPG and it's pretty.

39:27.700 --> 39:36.660
Um, it's actually the sequel to a cross gate, which was an MMO, um, that was in Japan since

39:36.660 --> 39:40.020
2001 and it's, it's just very cute.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.380
So I'm going to, I want to give it a try.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.700
Hooray for free and hooray for cute, right?

39:45.700 --> 39:47.220
As long as it's not MapleStory.

39:48.980 --> 39:49.860
All right.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.460
Why all the hate for MapleStory?

39:51.460 --> 39:51.860
I don't know.

39:51.860 --> 39:53.300
I've never even played MapleStory.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.100
It doesn't look fun.

39:54.820 --> 39:56.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.460
You know, you may have spoiled Ragnarok online.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.660
Ragnarok has withstood the test of time.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.140
Yeah, sure.

40:09.140 --> 40:15.300
One thing Ragnarok does not have that Dungeon Runners does have is a bling gnome.

40:15.940 --> 40:16.580
That's right.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.860
A bling gnome.

40:17.860 --> 40:20.500
What per se is a bling gnome you may ask?

40:21.060 --> 40:22.660
Well, I'm about to tell you.

40:22.660 --> 40:23.700
It's a gnome with bling?

40:24.580 --> 40:25.860
Yeah, sort of.

40:25.860 --> 40:31.620
A bling gnome is a pet of sorts that runs around and picks up, um, all gold dropped

40:31.620 --> 40:36.020
from bad guys while you, um, also kill other things.

40:36.020 --> 40:42.420
And, uh, the gnome also will take, um, items or picked up dropped items that aren't rare

40:42.420 --> 40:43.460
and eat them.

40:43.460 --> 40:46.180
Then he poops out gold as a reward.

40:46.180 --> 40:47.860
That's the best thing ever.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.020
I want a gnome that poops gold.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.780
And they have screenshots to back it up.

40:53.780 --> 41:01.300
Yes, the bling gnome who, who set, who either has loot or woot tattooed to his stomach.

41:02.820 --> 41:04.900
I don't know, but, uh, it's kind of funny.

41:06.500 --> 41:10.500
And, uh, for those who may not be familiar with Dungeon Runner, it is a free MMO.

41:10.500 --> 41:15.620
So where can you check this game out if you want to see this, uh, amazing, um, pooping

41:15.620 --> 41:16.260
gnome?

41:16.260 --> 41:17.700
DungeonRunners.com.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.260
Oh, well, I should have been able to figure that one out, huh?

41:20.260 --> 41:22.100
Oh my God, this is the best thing ever.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.860
And he says he does have woot on him.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.020
And he, I think it's loot.

41:26.020 --> 41:28.900
Oh, I thought it says, no, it could be a little of both.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.060
Maybe woot on the front and loot on the back.

41:31.060 --> 41:37.460
Maybe it's pooped because he poops out, you know, gold.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.180
Well, um, Hey, who wouldn't want to know that poops out gold?

41:40.180 --> 41:40.980
I mean, that's awesome.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.940
Um, I really don't know how to follow up that story.

41:43.940 --> 41:49.940
So I'll just say in other PC gaming news, civilization four is getting a new spinoff.

41:49.940 --> 41:52.420
It's civilization four colonization.

41:52.420 --> 41:57.220
It is not an expansion to the existing civilization four, um, because you're actually not going

41:57.220 --> 42:00.020
to need the original Civ four to actually play this game.

42:00.020 --> 42:05.460
In fact, if you think way back, if you remember old school civilization, like I do the actual

42:05.460 --> 42:11.620
first sequel to civilization of sorts, wasn't civilization two, it was a game called colonization

42:11.620 --> 42:15.940
where you could play as like, I think you played as the British, the French, the Spanish,

42:15.940 --> 42:16.660
or the Dutch.

42:16.660 --> 42:22.420
I want to say, and you could actually play to colonize the new world or America.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.220
No, it wasn't Mars.

42:23.220 --> 42:24.660
You were actually playing Colin.

42:24.660 --> 42:28.420
You were colonizing the new world and it was kind of just a whole like different type of

42:28.420 --> 42:30.580
game, but very similar to the civilization gameplay.

42:30.580 --> 42:35.060
Well, basically they're remaking it and putting the Civ four name on it to see if it sells

42:35.060 --> 42:38.100
a little better this time, I suppose, but it's kind of neat that they're going back

42:38.100 --> 42:39.620
and re revisiting it.

42:39.620 --> 42:43.380
So, uh, two K games is, uh, announced this and saying that the game will have all new

42:43.380 --> 42:48.180
graphics, um, I guess that's all new from the previous colonization, cause honestly

42:48.180 --> 42:50.340
it looks like it's just being done in the Civ four engine.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.300
Not that that's a bad thing.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.100
And it's going to have an improved diplomacy system.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.780
So should be pretty interesting.

42:57.780 --> 42:58.420
So check that out.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.860
Civ four colonization.

42:59.860 --> 43:02.020
I'll be very curious to see how that compares to the original.

43:04.420 --> 43:06.180
Maybe it will be fun.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.820
So, um, remember that thing about me seeing penny arcade earlier?

43:10.820 --> 43:13.300
Well, um, here it is.

43:13.300 --> 43:16.100
How's that for like your, you know, tremendous long wait, whatever.

43:16.660 --> 43:24.020
Um, the penny arcade game is now available on steam and, um, it's called a penny arcade

43:24.020 --> 43:26.820
adventures on the rain slick precipice of darkness.

43:26.820 --> 43:33.780
Episode one is there at www dot steam games.com.

43:34.500 --> 43:39.380
Um, and it will also be offering the future, um, uh, episodes there.

43:39.380 --> 43:42.260
And there are achievements available for steam purchasers.

43:43.300 --> 43:44.660
So, uh, go check it out.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.900
And by the way, the game is very funny.

43:48.260 --> 43:49.300
There's our first review.

43:49.860 --> 43:50.580
You heard it here.

43:50.580 --> 43:51.620
If you haven't heard.

43:52.580 --> 43:53.780
Yeah, you have.

43:53.780 --> 43:57.460
Now, you know, and knowing is half the battle or whatever.

43:58.020 --> 44:00.100
Um, yeah, I hate you.

44:00.660 --> 44:01.460
I hate you too.

44:02.260 --> 44:02.660
Okay.

44:03.700 --> 44:04.340
You know me.

44:04.340 --> 44:11.460
You know me well, uh, never when your nights two is getting yet another expansion.

44:11.460 --> 44:18.180
Um, the new expansions being called storm of Z her, and it's going to be the second

44:18.180 --> 44:24.820
expansion, um, for the game that came out in 2006, it will add a single player campaign

44:24.820 --> 44:27.780
with approximately 15 hours of gameplay.

44:27.780 --> 44:32.340
It'll add a new classes, spells, creatures, and a new playable race.

44:32.340 --> 44:38.500
Uh, also there is a new overland map that is being introduced that allow players to

44:38.500 --> 44:41.220
explore, um, the shoot.

44:41.220 --> 44:46.820
It looks like a Chilton peninsula sword coast and, uh, Samarit.

44:47.460 --> 44:53.380
And it looks like they also have got, um, Hmm.

44:53.380 --> 44:54.900
Looks like that's pretty much it.

44:54.900 --> 44:57.540
And it's due out, I guess the fourth quarter of this year.

44:57.540 --> 45:00.340
So something around Christmas, perhaps.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.380
Isn't it funny that we started off tonight with the D and D story and now we're ending

45:03.380 --> 45:06.340
with a, you know, game that a lot of D and D players love never winter nights.

45:06.340 --> 45:09.540
Cause you can kind of make your own, um, scenarios in there.

45:10.180 --> 45:11.780
Jamie's giving me the metal hand right there.

45:11.780 --> 45:12.420
All right.

45:12.420 --> 45:14.820
Um, w what?

45:16.100 --> 45:17.140
The camera's too far over.

45:17.140 --> 45:20.100
I was trying to insert my, oh no, it's way too far over.

45:20.820 --> 45:22.660
You gotta be able to get to about different Rob.

45:23.780 --> 45:24.660
There you go.

45:24.660 --> 45:25.060
All right.

45:25.060 --> 45:30.340
Uh, one last story tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line www dot orange

45:30.340 --> 45:31.060
launch radio.com.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.860
Click on interact with us to see all the different ways you can give us a call.

45:33.860 --> 45:38.180
It's our username on Skype is orange launch radio or our free 800 number for us and Canada

45:38.180 --> 45:40.260
one eight seven seven game O L R.

45:40.260 --> 45:42.420
But first one more story for you guys.

45:42.420 --> 45:47.700
And, um, it's a little bit of a retro, uh, some retro goodness.

45:47.700 --> 45:48.260
Quick.

45:48.260 --> 45:49.780
How do you get 30 lives in Contra?

45:51.140 --> 45:53.140
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.

45:53.140 --> 45:53.700
Exactly.

45:53.700 --> 45:56.020
Everybody knows the famous Konami code, right?

45:56.020 --> 45:59.140
Well, how do you get all of the power-ups in, um, Gradius?

45:59.700 --> 46:02.340
Uh, you pause the game and then up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.

46:02.340 --> 46:03.220
How do you do it in Proteus?

46:03.220 --> 46:04.900
Uh, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.

46:04.900 --> 46:05.300
Backwards.

46:05.860 --> 46:06.340
Whatever.

46:07.060 --> 46:07.700
Here's the thing.

46:07.700 --> 46:09.780
So everybody knows that fricking Konami code.

46:09.780 --> 46:15.220
Well, what's funny is that, um, you can actually use this code in Google reader.

46:16.580 --> 46:20.500
Seriously, this code works in Google reader for presented from Google.

46:20.500 --> 46:24.340
If you put up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA on your keyboard,

46:24.340 --> 46:27.140
and you don't have to hit start because there is no start key on your keyboard.

46:27.140 --> 46:31.540
Um, all of your unread items will be reset to 30.

46:31.540 --> 46:35.860
And a little Ninja will come on the screen to watch you surf RSS feeds.

46:38.580 --> 46:40.580
And you might be asking why.

46:40.580 --> 46:42.980
And to that, I say, why the hell not?

46:44.020 --> 46:44.580
There you have it.

46:44.580 --> 46:46.420
Let's go to the phones and take some calls.

46:46.420 --> 46:48.580
If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR.

46:48.580 --> 46:49.700
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

46:49.700 --> 46:50.580
Who's this?

46:51.540 --> 46:53.860
Hi, this is Zorman calling in today.

46:53.860 --> 46:54.180
Hi.

46:56.340 --> 47:00.180
I'm just calling in today because I just know that never gets out before came out.

47:00.180 --> 47:02.180
And that's why you let everybody know that I'm

47:02.180 --> 47:05.540
basically not the type of person just bored into the hype.

47:07.540 --> 47:12.820
And I'm a kind of believer that I know that Loki has a little get solid and everything,

47:12.820 --> 47:15.780
but like, does anybody ever believe that there's going to be a good chance

47:15.780 --> 47:17.300
that the game's going to come out?

47:17.300 --> 47:19.780
Xbox 360.

47:19.780 --> 47:22.580
So you think this game is going to come out for Xbox 360.

47:22.580 --> 47:26.340
So somebody like me who's thinking of taking the plunge to get PlayStation 3

47:26.340 --> 47:28.660
soon to play a game like this ought to just wait.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.980
Exactly.

47:30.980 --> 47:35.780
OK, you know, I got to ask why, because this story comes up a lot where, you know,

47:35.780 --> 47:38.900
there's the OMG is going to come out on 360 and then Konami says, no, it's not.

47:38.900 --> 47:40.500
OMG is going to come out on 360.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.940
No, it's really not.

47:41.940 --> 47:47.060
So what do you think is now why it's going to come out now that it's been released?

47:47.060 --> 47:54.100
Well, one of the reasons why I think is because of the amount of if they don't pull the

47:54.100 --> 47:58.020
certain amount of system that they need, that they're going to have to come over and notice

47:58.020 --> 48:07.060
Bioshock and notice that was supposed to be originally for only exclusive Xbox 360.

48:09.060 --> 48:12.980
So I just think that maybe they just kept everybody quiet and hopefully it's going to

48:12.980 --> 48:15.540
come over to Xbox 360 to make money.

48:15.540 --> 48:20.500
Ah, so you're saying like very similar to the reasons why Bioshock and all those games

48:20.500 --> 48:21.460
were kept secret.

48:21.460 --> 48:25.140
And, you know, they swore that these that system, maybe Metal Gear Solid is going to

48:25.140 --> 48:26.020
go that same way.

48:26.020 --> 48:28.820
Did you see that little thing that was making the rounds around the Internet this week about

48:28.820 --> 48:32.580
kind of the joke that's inside Metal Gear about having to change discs?

48:32.580 --> 48:36.180
And then the guy the guy says, oh, wait, no, you don't have to change this because you're

48:36.180 --> 48:37.380
playing a Blu-ray game.

48:37.380 --> 48:38.260
You know, you see that?

48:39.300 --> 48:41.540
Oh, no, no, I haven't.

48:41.540 --> 48:43.060
But I haven't seen that.

48:43.060 --> 48:47.220
I tried my best to ignore all my friends that actually bought into the hype.

48:48.340 --> 48:52.340
I just I just really understand because you know how Microsoft is moving over the Blu-ray

48:53.380 --> 48:54.260
to understand that part.

48:54.260 --> 48:57.940
And it doesn't necessarily need to be on a Blu-ray disc for it to work as well.

48:57.940 --> 49:03.300
That's that's why I'm thinking that it's there's a good chance it could it can always

49:03.300 --> 49:06.180
revamp it and change it, you know, for it to work with 360.

49:06.180 --> 49:10.180
Yeah, but even if Microsoft came out with the Blu-ray player, which, you know, that

49:10.180 --> 49:14.420
rumor we brought that rumor up on last week's show and then Monday came no announcement.

49:14.420 --> 49:17.540
But let's say let's say Microsoft did come out with a Blu-ray player, although at this

49:17.540 --> 49:19.860
point, I don't think they will until their next system.

49:19.860 --> 49:20.980
But let's say let's say they did.

49:20.980 --> 49:22.340
Let's say they came out with a Blu-ray player.

49:22.340 --> 49:24.900
I don't think they're going to start putting out games on that player because they're

49:24.900 --> 49:26.660
going to want to tap into their existing user base.

49:26.660 --> 49:29.460
They don't want to suddenly say games can only be on this.

49:29.460 --> 49:31.860
You know, I just don't think there'd be enough market for that.

49:33.060 --> 49:33.560
Right.

49:33.560 --> 49:39.560
I think that the user base is bigger on Xbox 360.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.800
And I think they'd rather tap into that user base.

49:42.840 --> 49:48.840
And I think they could be more influenced from Konami because the game isn't necessarily

49:49.720 --> 49:52.520
it's not like they're not it's not like Sony owns Konami in any way.

49:53.160 --> 49:53.660
Right.

49:53.960 --> 49:58.840
Well, you know, I would love to see the Xbox 360 port happen as well, but I don't know

49:58.840 --> 50:03.480
sometimes for whatever reason, they like to keep these things system exclusive for whatever

50:03.480 --> 50:04.520
backdoor deals happen.

50:05.240 --> 50:05.960
So we'll see.

50:06.600 --> 50:10.440
Konami will keep tonight, but E3 would be a good time for them to announce it if they

50:10.440 --> 50:10.940
wanted to.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.000
Yeah, you're right.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.520
And that didn't come up yet as well.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.560
So we'll see.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.400
Let's just all keep our fingers together.

50:17.400 --> 50:17.900
Thanks a lot.

50:18.440 --> 50:18.760
All right.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.320
Take care, buddy.

50:19.320 --> 50:19.960
Thanks for calling.

50:21.240 --> 50:23.960
I'll be crossing my fingers for you on the Xbox 360 Metal Gear.

50:23.960 --> 50:24.680
I don't know.

50:24.680 --> 50:26.360
Part of me says not going to happen.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.600
I think they've denied it so many times.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.440
I think if they were to come out and release on 360 now, I don't know.

50:32.440 --> 50:35.240
They'd have to have a lot of extras or something to kind of justify it.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.040
But we'll see.

50:36.040 --> 50:36.360
We'll see.

50:36.360 --> 50:36.840
You never know.

50:37.640 --> 50:38.680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

50:38.680 --> 50:39.180
Who's this?

50:40.360 --> 50:41.320
This is Oscar.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.680
Hey, Oscar, what's on your mind, buddy?

50:44.440 --> 50:45.000
Not much.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.920
I'm just happy that I managed to get my hands on the Metal Gear Solid 4 limited edition

50:48.920 --> 50:49.480
this week.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.360
Ah, what'd you think?

50:50.360 --> 50:52.120
I didn't even reserve the game either.

50:52.120 --> 50:52.620
What's that?

50:53.400 --> 50:55.800
I didn't even reserve the game either, and I found it.

50:56.760 --> 50:57.960
I think they did a pretty good job.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.920
They knew the demand was going to be pretty high for this, so they made a lot of copies

51:00.920 --> 51:01.320
of it.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.040
Well, what'd you think?

51:02.040 --> 51:03.160
Surely you've opened it up by now.

51:03.160 --> 51:03.660
What do you think?

51:05.960 --> 51:10.040
Well, I've only had time to play about three hours of it so far, and it's pretty great.

51:10.040 --> 51:11.400
It's really epic.

51:12.280 --> 51:13.960
That's the only word you can describe it.

51:14.840 --> 51:18.680
I think that's kind of the consensus around here at OLR Studios this evening.

51:18.680 --> 51:19.480
The game is epic.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.080
What makes it so epic?

51:21.080 --> 51:22.520
Is it just the cutscenes epic?

51:23.800 --> 51:25.320
What is it that makes the game so epic?

51:26.600 --> 51:31.880
Well, I remember back when Hideo Kojima, he was all talking about how the

51:31.880 --> 51:37.400
PS3 was the only system he wanted to be in because he wanted to be like a movie, basically.

51:37.400 --> 51:38.120
And I don't know.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.400
It kind of plays like a movie to me.

51:41.640 --> 51:46.040
Here's my question, because you have the cutscenes, and we've heard a lot about the cutscenes,

51:46.040 --> 51:48.520
and how they're very long, and how they're very epic.

51:48.520 --> 51:53.000
How about the game itself, the actual game that you are playing?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.600
I mean, is the game cool?

51:56.680 --> 51:58.360
Well, what's it consider?

51:58.360 --> 51:59.000
Is it like a...

52:00.440 --> 52:01.560
What kind of game is it even consider?

52:01.560 --> 52:03.480
It's like a strategy shooter or something like that?

52:04.360 --> 52:06.840
A stealth action strategy game.

52:06.840 --> 52:07.240
I don't know.

52:08.600 --> 52:09.240
Okay.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.160
Well, I don't know.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.600
Usually the games are kind of like that.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.160
Like, I don't know.

52:13.160 --> 52:16.120
All I can think of is like Rainbow Six, maybe.

52:16.120 --> 52:18.520
But I got bored with Rainbow Six.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.400
This I didn't.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.160
I'm very into it.

52:22.600 --> 52:28.120
Is it because the story really draws you in in a way that maybe Rainbow Six doesn't really

52:28.120 --> 52:29.560
have quite the same epic cutscenes?

52:29.560 --> 52:31.320
That has to be it.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.560
Rainbow Six, the story was...

52:34.760 --> 52:35.880
I don't know, bored me.

52:35.880 --> 52:39.240
As I was saying earlier in the show, Kojima has always been a bit of a storyteller, even

52:39.240 --> 52:40.280
in the NES days.

52:40.280 --> 52:45.320
I mean, the very, very first Metal Gear game that was on the NES, or really, MSX, if you

52:45.320 --> 52:51.480
want to go that far back, kind of had depth and story that not a lot of games at that

52:51.480 --> 52:51.960
time had.

52:53.160 --> 52:56.600
Quelltippo in chat says it's tactical espionage action.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.560
I forgot that.

52:57.560 --> 52:58.840
It even says it right there on the box.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.520
That would be the genre the game fits into.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.000
Okay, that's what I thought it was.

53:03.000 --> 53:03.480
There you go.

53:03.480 --> 53:03.720
All right.

53:04.760 --> 53:05.160
All right.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.920
And there's no guard humping in this one.

53:08.120 --> 53:11.000
Well, Asif or anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

53:12.520 --> 53:14.760
I got Mario Kart Wii, and I challenge you.

53:15.480 --> 53:16.680
All right, we'll make it happen.

53:16.680 --> 53:17.880
We'll have to set up a time.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.120
I'll try to set up something in the forums this week, like a time.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.520
Because Bobby Black Wolf wants to have a go at it, too.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.760
So I'll try to set something up when we're both available.

53:25.880 --> 53:26.360
All right.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.000
All right.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
We'll let you know.

53:29.000 --> 53:29.480
Okay.

53:29.480 --> 53:29.720
All right.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.200
Later, buddy.

53:31.160 --> 53:31.480
All right.

53:31.480 --> 53:31.880
See you.

53:31.880 --> 53:32.600
See you.

53:32.600 --> 53:32.920
All right.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.080
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.520
Our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

53:36.520 --> 53:37.480
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

53:37.480 --> 53:37.800
Who's this?

53:39.080 --> 53:41.000
This is Spazzinator.

53:41.000 --> 53:41.880
Hey, Spazzinator.

53:41.880 --> 53:42.600
What's on your mind, buddy?

53:43.720 --> 53:48.840
Well, I just want to kind of comment on two or three things, if I may.

53:48.840 --> 53:49.340
Sure.

53:49.960 --> 53:50.200
Yeah.

53:50.920 --> 53:55.400
It's for your little rant about Nintendo earlier in Parday.

53:55.400 --> 53:55.880
Uh-huh.

53:55.880 --> 53:58.840
The only thing I'm going to say is right on.

53:59.800 --> 54:04.280
In fact, I've been more or less boycotting up for the past 10 or 11 years.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.920
I can't speak for everyone out there.

54:08.920 --> 54:15.800
But personally, I feel that Nintendo really hasn't been pointing out anything for their

54:15.800 --> 54:16.360
systems.

54:16.360 --> 54:22.360
They've really been overly compelling, aside from maybe one or two titles for the past

54:23.160 --> 54:23.960
couple systems.

54:23.960 --> 54:32.600
And of course, Smash Brothers Brawl and whatnot notwithstanding.

54:33.240 --> 54:38.120
But the last really truly system they really had was the Super Nintendo.

54:39.720 --> 54:48.440
But granted, the N64 did have a few good games out there, like Goldeneye and whatnot.

54:48.440 --> 54:54.280
But aside from that, ever since then, they've been going downhill ever since then.

54:54.280 --> 55:00.120
You know, I've cooled off a little bit, since I got very hot-headed during Parday.

55:00.120 --> 55:06.360
And I'm a little regretful that the actions of this guy at Nintendo of Europe kind of

55:06.360 --> 55:08.840
hurts the company's image as a whole.

55:08.840 --> 55:15.160
Right on down from the president, from Reggie Visa May, all the way down to the little people

55:15.160 --> 55:19.800
that work at Nintendo that probably don't deserve a boycott or what have you.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.800
But damn it, something has got to give.

55:21.800 --> 55:27.400
And we have got to show that this guy is made of suck for making this statement.

55:29.640 --> 55:32.600
Something beyond just a little apology needs to happen.

55:33.400 --> 55:34.280
Because here's the thing.

55:34.280 --> 55:38.280
And the reason why I said as part of my boycott that if Nintendo addresses it, I would be

55:38.280 --> 55:39.320
OK with it.

55:39.320 --> 55:44.600
And I would end my boycott is because if Nintendo were to address it, it would invalidate

55:44.600 --> 55:47.400
everything this guy said about it being for geeks and otaku.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.680
And this guy would look like a moron.

55:51.640 --> 55:57.800
That's part of the reason why I said that I will forgive and forget if Nintendo will

55:57.800 --> 56:00.360
say, look, we are going to do something about it.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.200
And it's not just for geeks and otaku.

56:03.320 --> 56:13.080
Yeah, well, that guy's comments kind of factors into my opinion that over the past few years,

56:13.080 --> 56:19.480
you know, Nintendo has been getting like what I guess could be termed as like an overinflated

56:19.480 --> 56:20.040
ego.

56:20.040 --> 56:25.080
You know, they've been kind of like, I don't know if you want to call it ruffians or laurels

56:25.080 --> 56:27.000
or whatever or things then.

56:27.000 --> 56:33.720
But that's definitely prevalent on all sides of Nintendo.

56:33.720 --> 56:34.120
Hold up.

56:34.120 --> 56:38.360
Since Super Nintendo, you know, after Super Nintendo, Nintendo did not exactly enjoy world

56:38.360 --> 56:41.400
success with the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube.

56:41.400 --> 56:45.480
Granted, those systems weren't failure per se, but they weren't number one.

56:45.480 --> 56:46.120
It doesn't matter.

56:46.120 --> 56:47.960
They still think they're fucking cocky.

56:47.960 --> 56:50.520
And we see it on the retail side.

56:50.520 --> 56:53.720
We see it also on consumer side.

56:55.160 --> 56:59.720
Unfortunately, it's just, you know, I don't know their mentality.

56:59.720 --> 57:05.400
They have they control their market with the releasing of their systems and stuff like

57:05.400 --> 57:06.040
that.

57:06.040 --> 57:10.280
I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of shortage going around that's intentional.

57:10.280 --> 57:14.840
I mean, I don't know, but, you know, at the same time, they're doing this stuff, you know,

57:14.840 --> 57:22.760
with suing third party, you know, peripheral manufacturers and, you know, this stuff.

57:22.760 --> 57:26.440
They all they have a schedule of how they're going to release this stuff and they're going

57:26.440 --> 57:29.320
to slowly roll out stuff to keep people interested.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.840
It's just like, you know, Wii Fit and stuff.

57:30.840 --> 57:36.200
The Wii console people finally have it now and they're just like, hmm, how can we get

57:36.200 --> 57:38.760
people interested in this console again like they were at launch?

57:38.760 --> 57:39.240
Oh, I know.

57:39.240 --> 57:42.360
Let's release Wii Fit now and make that fucking hard to find.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.240
There you go.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.640
And now it's, you know, all coming around again.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.040
And watch when Wii Sports 2 comes out.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.160
Here we go again.

57:49.160 --> 57:51.640
It's just going to be, you know, a constant cycle.

57:51.640 --> 57:55.720
They're going to slowly roll out stuff that they should have rolled out at launch throughout

57:55.720 --> 57:57.560
the lifetime of this console.

57:57.560 --> 58:03.000
Somebody needs to tell Nintendo, I made you and I can break you just as easily.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.320
So much to tell Nintendo that people are going to stop waiting for stuff to happen and they're

58:07.320 --> 58:07.960
going to move on.

58:07.960 --> 58:12.760
Because they may buy your console, but they're not going to buy any of your games or buy

58:12.760 --> 58:14.440
your virtual console stuff.

58:14.440 --> 58:18.760
I mean, sure, they've made a little bit of money off of people from buying the console.

58:18.760 --> 58:22.280
I can't imagine that they're making a ton of money on each console sales.

58:22.280 --> 58:28.680
But, you know, if people are just staying there and playing Wii Sports and then say,

58:28.680 --> 58:34.120
ah, forget this online stuff, it's not happening and I can't, you know, find space to save

58:34.120 --> 58:36.280
my games and stuff and have to re-download them later.

58:36.280 --> 58:41.560
And people are just going to get confused and get overwhelmed by it and they're just

58:41.560 --> 58:42.280
going to say, forget it.

58:42.280 --> 58:44.040
I don't want to, I'm not going to do that.

58:44.760 --> 58:49.320
And it sucks because the people that are actually supporting them and utilizing this stuff,

58:49.320 --> 58:51.640
they're just saying, ah, you're not important.

58:53.480 --> 58:54.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:54.600 --> 58:58.840
Don't get me wrong, you know, at least way back in the day, I used to be a really big

58:58.840 --> 59:00.360
Nintendo fanboy and whatnot.

59:00.360 --> 59:06.760
But, you know, once I started realizing that, you know, starting with N64, you know, relatively

59:06.760 --> 59:11.880
few games were coming out that I was particularly interested in, I kind of started, you know,

59:11.880 --> 59:15.080
fully, partially moving over to the Sony camp.

59:15.080 --> 59:21.880
And I've been with Sony now for, you know, ever since, like, roughly when Final Fantasy

59:21.880 --> 59:22.840
VII came out.

59:24.840 --> 59:28.920
Here's the thing, and, you know, in reference to kind of like what I said and stuff, is

59:28.920 --> 59:33.720
that, you know, I'm a Nintendo fanboy too, and this is what kind of stinks about the

59:33.720 --> 59:38.520
whole thing is that, you know, I've been so supportive of the Nintendo Wii and I've spent

59:38.520 --> 59:46.200
a lot, a lot of money on those virtual console downloads to kind of have this happen, sucks.

59:46.200 --> 59:50.120
So it's not about what, and if you're thinking I'm overreacting just because I was called

59:50.120 --> 59:52.840
the geek, you're not really hearing what I'm saying.

59:52.840 --> 59:59.160
I'm saying that why would Nintendo dismiss the people that have been supporting them

59:59.160 --> 59:59.880
like this?

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.800
That's what sucks about it.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:10.200
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I kind of, you know, you know, felt the same way, you know,

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:16.200
when, you know, you know, going years back, not because, you know, they make comments,

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:21.800
you know, you know, but because they weren't really keeping up with the times and they

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:27.480
weren't, you know, their games weren't really going up with the people that have been supporting

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.080
them since way back when, you know.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:38.200
Obviously, you know, the people that grew up with the original NES or SNES, eventually

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.400
their, you know, taste and games were going to change and, you know, their selection of

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.240
games, you know, didn't really change with the times, you know.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.480
All right, Spaznator, we've got to let you go so we can get to at least one more call,

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.960
but thank you so much for your call and take care, okay?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.320
All right, you too.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:55.880
All right, bye-bye.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.640
All right, one more call.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.240
Boy, we didn't even have to wait.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.840
They're just calling in back to back tonight.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.640
I feel popular.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.760
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.080
Who's this?

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.480
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.680
Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.760
Oh, a lot of things.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.400
So what's this?

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:11.880
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.440
First thing I want to ask, you're coming out here in like two weeks, right?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.480
Yes.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.840
Okay, and you said something about you're going to fix our Justin TV cam when you're

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.340
here?

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.080
I'm going to do my best.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.760
I am very technically inclined.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.440
All right, Loki thinks he can do it, too.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.480
So between the two of y'all, I think we're going to have a high-tech studio by the time

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.160
the 4th of July rolls around.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.120
All right, you can talk about whatever you want to do now, sorry.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:33.960
Kill, kill.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.680
Couple of things.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.760
Ask for the guy from Nintendo of Europe by this comment, am I the only one that doesn't

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.280
give two shits about what the hell he said?

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.880
Well, here's the thing.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.080
I don't care.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.760
Look, I get called a geek.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.840
I say thanks, you know?

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.000
I don't, being a geek is not a bad thing, but it's the fact that he was, and I think

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Jamie kind of referenced this, he was using these things as a derogatory thing.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.760
So he's basically saying, well, we're not going to put something out because we don't

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.600
really care about the people who want this.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.400
And it's kind of like, well, F you, because if I've spent $100 on all these different

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.760
virtual console games I filled up and I was planning on spending even more, then if I'm

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.720
just boo-boo to you, then forget it.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.920
I'm not going to spend any more money.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:25.960
Well, the proper thing to say would have been, Nintendo understands that this is definitely

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.840
a problem and we are addressing it and we are working towards fixing said problem.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.520
Or just say, he could have just said, unfortunately, at this time, Nintendo has no fix for this.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.040
He could have given the same BS, the same line we've heard from Nintendo time and time

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.440
again.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:45.080
Unfortunately, at this time, folks will have to delete the game and they can always re-download

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:45.880
it for free.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.120
He could have given that same line and I wouldn't have cared.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.480
I would have still thought Nintendo probably needs to address their storage issue at some

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.880
point, but I wouldn't have cared.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.760
But the fact that he had to be so standoffish about it just sucks.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.400
And why would you put someone like that in as your freaking VP of marketing?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.160
I mean, that's the part that appalls me.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.200
So they promote with him.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.360
Well, that's what it sounds like.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:11.480
Right.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.080
And Game Guru says, and Awada actually did say that, Rob, and I have nothing but nice

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.840
things to say about Awada.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.000
I have nothing but I am a Nintendo fan boy.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.480
The man's done a lot and I'm fine with that line because I understand they're dancing

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.080
around the fact that their system has limitations and that's the PC thing to say.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.640
But for this guy to come out with guns ablaze and is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, you

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.600
want to pick a fight?

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.480
You want to pick a fight?

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.960
Sounds like the guy was PMSing.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.320
Seriously.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:38.520
Yes.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.280
I've had no more Nintendo talk.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.960
Seriously, I'm done with it.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.160
So what else is on your mind?

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.400
I remember growing up that arcades were the shit.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.600
I remember growing up, my aunt would take me to this space called Nathan's.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.640
You go inside.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.320
It was like heaven.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.160
Hunt is like 50, 60 different kinds of arcades you can play.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.080
And that's why I first got my hands on Final Fight and fell in love with Capcom right there.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.800
And nowadays it's like you go into like a little rinky dink sports center where they

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:16.040
have hockey, ice skating, you go upstairs as a concession stand, you go around the corner,

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.920
there's three arcade machines and a bootleg Cuzar.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.080
The place I remember was a little place called Nickel Mania where you would pay $2.50 to

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.000
get in and then all the games ran on nickels.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.280
It was awesome.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.360
That's like the first place I ever played Mortal Combat.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.040
That's cool.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.960
Sadly, it's no more.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:35.880
You know what?

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.520
When you make your visit out here.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.480
Yeah, we're going to have to.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.440
We're going to have to take you to Roseville Golf Land because that's really one of the

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.880
last actual arcades that I'm glad you didn't throwing good in there.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.600
It's it's what we got.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.040
I think that's I think that's a good way to pray.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.600
It's what we got.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.080
I went to Scandi and he said that it's just completely.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.880
Yes, yeah.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.440
Well, Scandi and Scandi is just confused on what it's trying to be anyways.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.080
But, you know, we might have to we have to actually might have to take a trip to Milpitas

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.840
Golf Land because that one's still fairly decent.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.800
Yeah, Milpitas and Sunnyvale are still OK, even.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.320
But you notice it's Sunnyvale also has the test machines, though.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.600
But slowly that stuff's been going out and Flaming Fingers been coming in.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.320
Not that Flaming Fingers a bad thing, but too much of it is.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.760
What about the jump rope game again?

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.120
Something we're going to have to go also go to John's incredibly mediocre pizza.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.680
Oh, we do need to go to John's incredibly shitty pizza.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.000
You haven't still haven't sent me a certain email, sir.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:38.940
I did.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.080
You did it just now.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:41.580
OK.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.280
No, like earlier last week.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.480
But God damn it.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.800
Y'all make me want to hop on a plane to come tonight.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.080
The problem is that your airline is trying to make me sign up for some mailing list so

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.920
that I can actually see the email.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.520
So I just need a copy paste.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.120
No problem.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.320
I'll resend it out.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:05:59.960
Thank you.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.120
All right, Rama, quickly, anything else before we end the show?

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.440
No, that's it.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:05.800
All right.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.440
Take care, buddy.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.560
You too.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.520
Bye bye.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.020
Bye.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.840
Rob D says too much of the Flaming Finger is a bad thing.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.160
Let me clarify my statement.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.440
Too much of the Flaming Finger requires soothing action.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.640
There's nothing wrong with a little Flaming Finger here and there.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.280
But you don't want to OD on Flaming Finger.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.760
You need to mix it up a little bit.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.680
All right, forget it.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.760
That's going to do it for phone calls tonight.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.800
Thank you guys for calling in.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.920
If you didn't get through, so sorry.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.600
But send us an email or try again next week.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.840
Or you can always leave a voicemail.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.320
We'll catch up.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.840
I've got voicemails we got to play.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.600
We'll try to catch up on those in a future week.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.280
For now, we got to wrap it up.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.360
But not until we do some last minute stories of which I'm sure Loki has some.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:48.860
Loki?

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.080
Yeah, I've just been going over the stuff that we didn't talk about.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.840
Part of the big leak list that we talked about in part A.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.640
Here's another game.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.680
I don't know what it's called.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:04.040
But it's basically Dr. Octopus and Magneto have joined forces to create the most dangerous

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.560
alliance in the world ever known.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.920
And Spider-Man must team up with the X-Men to stop them.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:18.040
Choose two heroes to fight side by side across multiple levels spanning the globe from Manhattan

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.400
to the Savage Lands.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.720
Pick Spidey or one of the dozen X-Men such as Wolverine, Cyclops, or Storm where it pays

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.440
off to select different characters depending on the enemies you face or unique game environments

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.240
you are in.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.800
Earn upgrades for each character you use.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.600
Experience unique combos specific to tube.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.000
Are they just reusing the Marvel Ultimate Alliance engine like over and over and over

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:41.320
again?

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.200
I mean seriously.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.120
Or I should say X-Men Legends engine.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.120
All right.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.720
Anyways, let's see what else here.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:08:00.840
We've got some more stuff coming from this big leak list here including...

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.480
Oh, we talked about all this stuff.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.240
They have the Mensa workout.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.480
I guess it's gonna be another brain training game for the Wii.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.320
And I don't know how Extreme Makeover Home Edition is gonna be any fun.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:15.720
We'll see.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.480
There was a game I had on the Commodore 64 called like Dream House or something like

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.320
that and pretty much all you did is you went through the house and you could paint all

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.840
the like you could paint the ceiling and the walls a different color one of 16 colors because

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.680
you know Commodore 64 was cutting edge and then you could put furniture in the house

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.320
too.

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.760
And but you were only limited to like eight pieces of furniture in a room because you

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.760
know there's all those limitations on the 64.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.240
I hope that God was like half these games are fake or not really fake but just like

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.240
concepts that are never gonna come to you know in the past because if that's the case

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.520
there's gonna be like 20 Spider-Man games coming out between now and like probably a

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.800
couple years from now.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.920
Including Spider-Man Agile Warrior where it lets players control Spider or Spider-Man

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.760
with the Wii balance board.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.000
There's Spider-Man Hero Evolved for the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:08.920

There's Spider-Man New Heights for the 360, PS3, and the Wii.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.000

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.200

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.240
Spider-Man Gangs of New York.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.720
Okay seriously uh gangs take over the whole city and Spider-Man must pit them against

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.200
each other.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.760
Spider-Man Adaption.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.720
Spidey travels all over the globe from Tokyo to Paris to Moscow to take out foes.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.440
Marvel Team-Up.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.640
Spider-Man meets X-Men.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.720
I think that was the one that I was talking about earlier.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.160
Spider-Man Contest of Champions 360, PS3, and Wii.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:53.000

Spider-Man Web Slinger, use precision web aiming to target enemies building or build

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.040
web slingshots and snipe enemies.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.840
I think some of those are all like ideas but aren't going to come out because that'd be

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.040
way too much.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:58.040
The avatars, one of the things that people noticed, there were some licensed things with

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.320
them as well so maybe some licensed clothing stuff you'll be able to get it because they

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.800
had one of them with an Incredibles t-shirt.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.560
Sounds kind of neat.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.840
Let's see here.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.720
Oh, Ultimate Band.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:19.240
They're going to be doing an Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 version apparently of the game

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:25.080
and it will be to, I'm sure, Rob's enjoyment, compatible with Rock Band instruments.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:25.800
Thank God.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.800
And the Wii U version, of course, does not have instruments at all.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.240
And it's actually got a video out there for it too on how you play.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.200
It's kind of interesting.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.560
Let's see here.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:45.080
Then there was also one of the things was the SBGs, which is server-based gaming, and

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.600
apparently it's going to be like a social networking blade or something like that that

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:56.680
allow you to play games from game shows like Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.560
other things like that.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.720
So that's kind of interesting.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:08.280
And finally, Powers and Titans, which is a multiplayer superhero game that's apparently

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.160
going to be something that Joss Whedon is going to be a part of.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:13.800
Woohoo!

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.240
So I don't know what exactly that is, but probably some sort of superhero game.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.280
Actually, I'm mad at him.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.320
Why?

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:21.720
Why?

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.240
For the end of Astonishing X-Men.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:25.960
Okay.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.920
I think you'll get over it.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.600
Oh, no.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.080
You don't.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:29.400
That.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:29.900
No.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:40.920
And finally, in unrelated news, you may remember the Wii Fit girl who's been kind of floating

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.680
around, she had the YouTube video where she shook her ass while playing Wii Fit.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.000
Yes.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.120
Well, Playboy's Joe Garcia has put out her own videos that are a little bit more seductive,

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.200
also her playing Wii Fit as well.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.240
Trying to cash in on that.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:55.560
Nice.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.760
Well, you know we've moved into a new generation where people are trying to cash in on other

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.120
people's YouTube videos.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:02.760
It's amazing.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.080
Absolutely amazing.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:11.400
Yeah, so all right, awesome, and it'll be interesting.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.400
Logie will review those videos next week on the show.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.880
I don't know if there's...

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.480
Well, it didn't look that interesting.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.400
I mean, she didn't look that interesting.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.080
She doesn't get naked, okay?

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:25.240
I mean, this is a Playboy little pictorial thing that she does not get naked.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.680
I do not approve of that.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.180
Fine.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.960
But I do approve of people, you know, taking it to the next step.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:32.460
All right.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.340
To which I say, Wii Fit girl, you're a rebuttal.

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.940
If that's going to do it for our last minute stories tonight, I guess we're going to go

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:46.700
ahead and wrap up the show and bring another week of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.740
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, our sixth anniversary show, if you can believe it.

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.740
But nothing too special going on.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.780
Same old shit we always do.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:55.980
Hopefully some guests.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.540
I know...

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.220
No one's made any suggestions.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.900
Mieglatov will be here next week.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.100
I should get my husband here.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.380
So we'll at least have him.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.820
I was trying, by the way, I was trying to get one story we didn't get to tonight.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.700
I don't know if you read this.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.900
Did you read on the gaming blogs this week about that lady who's running for state senate

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:16.940
in Connecticut and how it's like this big deal, like, oh, politicians getting into games

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:19.180
because she has a level 70 in World of Warcraft.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.780
Did you see that story?

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.300
Yeah, I think it was last week.

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.100
Wasn't it fun?

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.620
I don't know if you thought of this, but didn't like the minute I read that, I'm like, what's

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.740
the big freaking deal?

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:33.340
Like my boyfriend ran for state senate in 2006 and he has two level 70s in Warcraft.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.100
I was actually trying to get him to come to the show tonight, but he didn't want to.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.140
He didn't.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.340
I don't know what he'd say.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.580
He was like, I don't know if I come up.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.340
He's like, what would I talk about if I went on your show?

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.820
I'm like, you play more World of Warcraft than I do.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.380
You'd fit in.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:51.420
Whenever you see a story like that, you just have to think of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:51.980
I'm hip.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:52.460
I'm cool.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:59.260
Yeah, but I'm just saying, you know what?

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:02.620
Politicians come in all different flavors, just like regular.

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:06.460
Why does it matter what your job is and what you like to do in your spare time?

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:12.060
For who the hell cares and what relevance does your gaming life have on your political

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:12.540
views?

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.460
Well, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.020
To be fair.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.660
The reason why I think it was going around is because, you know, there's been a lot of

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.340
negative political, like, you know, all these politicians are trying to ban games.

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:27.900
All these politicians are, you know, putting into place these, you know, that, you know,

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:31.420
all these violent video games are going to be banned or games are like porn and all this

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:31.660
stuff.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.100
So it was a little refreshing to hear of a politician who's like, yeah, I play World

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:35.740
of Warcraft.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.340
So well, I was just thinking she's not the first.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.740
But I just don't see what, you know, what you like to do as a hobby unless, you know,

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:51.100
you like to, you know, skin kittens in your backyard or something as a hobby.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.500
No, you know, but you play, you play video game.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.100
What's the problem?

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:55.980
Who cares?

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.380
I don't know.

01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:01.420
You know why it's like, you know, I don't care what people's bedroom habits are.

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.940
I don't care what their gaming habits are.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:08.300
You know, as long as they're not hurting anybody, what does it matter?

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.500
Right, right.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.500
And people piss me off.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.140
By the way, speaking of not caring about what goes on behind closed doors, I do want

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:24.780
to say, though, a very happy day tomorrow, Monday, June 15th and going on into June 16th

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:30.700
to all the new couples who will be getting married in California who finally, finally

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.140
have a quality.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.020
It's it's it's so amazing.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.420
I'm so happy to live in a state where that's going to only overrule it again.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:38.620
You know what?

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.940
Not if I have anything to say about it.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:49.180
Well, did you did you hear from Amanda about no capital open up now?

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.420
Did that actually happen?

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.380
I saw the website.

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.700
I know the friend was talking about opening one in the Castro.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:55.580
Did that actually happen?

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.380
I think so.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.260
Oh, my God.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.860
We'll have to get a link from her.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:16:59.900
Wow.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.660
That's great if that actually happened, huh?

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.380
But you know what?

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:07.100
I honestly think that, you know, eventually and I think that more and more people are

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.820
realizing this, that what does it matter?

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:13.580
I mean, and personally, and I've had this discussion with other people before, I actually

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:18.620
think that marriage should not be a government institution.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:19.180
You know what I mean?

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.820
Well, thankfully, and boy, we got off topic of video games.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.460
That's all right.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:22.780
They know.

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:23.500
That's all right.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.260
Thankfully, it's a topic that's important to me.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:25.740
So you know what?

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.240
Deal.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:33.180
Thankfully, the youth of America does not have their head up their ass in this regard.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.780
The majority in this regard.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.500
Yeah, the majority.

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.980
And I still know it makes me very.

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.940
Yeah, there's always going to be somebody with their head up their ass, but it makes

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.380
me very hopeful for the future.

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.140
Yeah, very hopeful for the future.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:44.940
All right.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.140
I was going to say one thing.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:46.540
I'm sorry.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.660
I missed one last thing.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:48.800
Yeah.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.220
Confident.

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:53.020
This is actually coming from our friends over at Bawani Style.

01:17:53.660 --> 01:18:01.180
Apparently, there was an MTV pack or an advertisement for rock band that they were showing a bunch

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.820
of songs kind of scrolling through the song list.

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:07.100
And lo and behold, there's a bunch of songs that haven't come out yet in there.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:11.260
So four songs that they spotted on there.

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:16.860
The Aesthetics of Hate by Machine Head, Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, which I believe is coming

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:23.020
out this next week, Breed by Nirvana, and Burn by Nine Inch Nails.

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:24.320
Sweet.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:25.580
Sounds like fun.

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.260
And I was going to say, I think there's a couple other stories that they had, too.

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:35.260
There was something about like new DDR or something like that.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:40.620
It was a DDR fitness thing.

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:45.100
They had some details on Konami's website and stuff.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:53.260
And then there's also some new rhythm game that's coming to the Xbox 360 that I don't

01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:55.580
know what it really is yet.

01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.220
Probably something that they're going to be announcing maybe at E3 or something like that.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:03.180
Beat and Groovy, as it was called.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:07.180
It's an E-rated Konami published title.

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:11.900
It says, from the sound of it, sounds like Konami's rhythm game, of course.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:18.220
And it was found on the Australia's ratings board webpage.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:26.300
And there is also another Xbox 360 titled Domino Master, which is supposed to be coming

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.380
to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:33.660
Wonder if that's Mr. Domino, because that'd be funny.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.220
All right.

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:42.060
Now that we've had the last, last, last minute stories, let's go ahead and wrap up the show.

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.700
We got all the final thoughts.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.380
We got the last, last minute story.

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.060
And you know Ultimate Band has Miley Cyrus in it, because it's a Disney title.

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.340
Oh my God.

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:51.980
So I was right.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.020
It has Hannah Montana in it.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.580
I have ESPN.

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.420
Isn't Dolly Parton our godmother?

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.100
I think so.

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:01.900
That's cool.

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.140
Yeah.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.420
I like Dolly Parton.

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.500
I don't like Hannah Montana, but I like Dolly Parton.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:05.740
All right.

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:05.980
All right.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.900
Before we get out of here tonight, we have one more thing we wanted to play for you guys.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.660
It came up in the email earlier.

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.940
It was what Katamari's Forever emailed us, right?

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:22.540
And sent us the parody of Still Alive, but it's featuring the OLR themed lyrics.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.020
Yes.

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.900
So we're actually going to play that for the listeners before we sign off tonight.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:26.860
So here it is.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.700
And then we're going to be out of here.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:33.100
So big thanks to Katamari's Forever and all the fans who got together to make the lyrics.

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:33.820
I can't wait to hear this.

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:56.540
Here you go.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:24.540
Yes.

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.540
But is it a stereo?

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.820
That was a joke.

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:40.780
Haha.

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.340
No, no.

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:48.780
Jamie's eating a scummy, but then again it's lucky.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:52.300
Look at us still singing with this used to be.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:56.860
Told me I tore the heart, but inside here it's so clear.

01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.780
Let this keep on the light.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:04.700
Oh, OLR Sunday nights, it's Pacific night and we still have time.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:08.460
And believe me, no 365.

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:12.460
I'm doing podcasts without 365.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.460
We're here on August, not 365.

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:20.460
And while you're dying, we'll know it's 365.

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:24.460
Podcasts of the year we all gonna strive.

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.460
Gonna strive.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.700
Gonna strive.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.660
Yay, nice job Katamari's Forever.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.300
That was very cool.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:35.420
It was a little hard to hear the voice, but that's okay.

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:38.140
I think on headphones, it'll come out a lot better.

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:44.060
I think it'll be easier to hear on headphones, but nice job and very, very flattering, nevertheless.

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.380
So thank you very much for that.

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.460
And thank you to everybody who is involved with that.

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.340
Okay, now I think we can end the show.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.020
So thank you very much for supporting independent podcasting as you always do.

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:59.740
Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program and help

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.660
spread the word because that's, you know, we don't have any big magazine or website backing

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:03.820
us.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.300
So we rely on word of mouth to get the word out.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.300
We do this for free because we heart you.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.940
So we'll see you next week for our sixth anniversary show.

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.140
That's going to do it for another OLR.

01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.020
Good night.

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.220
