0	20220	Tonight, June 29, 2008, is the latest game in a popular series going 8-bit.
20220	25240	Diablo 3 is finally announced and we talk on air to Tommy Tallarico from Video Games
25240	26240	Live!
26240	35520	Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35520	36520	Radio.
36520	41000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
41000	42500	and the gamer lifestyle.
42500	44040	My name is Rob Roberts.
44040	50220	You might know me as Sky if you talk to us online in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
50220	55620	But also joining us tonight, as always, the one, the only, the lovely, happiest bunny
55620	63480	on the farm, one and only, truly spectacular, dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
63480	67480	He's just trying to butter me up for something.
67480	68480	Can I have a dollar?
68480	69480	No.
69480	70480	I don't have a dollar.
70480	71480	You don't have a dollar.
71480	72480	No, I'm just kidding.
72480	73480	I don't know.
73480	75800	You can have some of my diet cherry Pepsi.
75800	77040	I'm in a festive mood tonight.
77040	78040	I don't know why.
78040	79040	You've been busy.
79040	80040	A busy boy.
80040	81040	I have been a very busy boy.
81040	82240	I was out of town most of the weekend.
82240	84200	I was marching in a big parade this morning.
84200	85720	I know what would make you cry.
85720	86720	What would make me cry?
86720	88520	You'll find out during what I've played this week.
88520	89520	Okay.
89520	91000	Well, we'll get to that in just a sec.
91000	94480	But I wouldn't be able to get to How Was Your Gaming Week if I wasn't able to introduce
94480	96720	the one and only tech master, Loki.
96720	97720	Hi.
97720	98720	How are you?
98720	99720	I'm fine.
99720	103520	I'm trying to figure out something that I was talking about before we started the show.
103520	106960	I can't remember the damn name of the game and it's bugging me.
106960	108560	What was it that we were talking about before the show?
108560	109560	We talked about a lot of things before the show.
109560	111880	I was saying that song should be in a side scrolling game.
111880	114400	I'm like the new Konami one.
114400	116600	I don't know the name of the game though.
116600	121320	Well, when you listen to us live on All Games Radio, which is where we tape our show live
121320	122320	Sunday nights.
122320	126100	We say we're a podcast, but really we're a live radio program because we have everything
126100	129040	going on with the chat room and the calls we'll get to later.
129040	133400	We play a little bit of live music that can't go to the podcast feed because it is copyright
133400	134560	and all that good stuff.
134560	136600	But we played a track by Akira Yomoka.
136600	139800	You know him from the dude that does all the music of Silent Hill.
139800	144520	He also contributes to one of our favorite gaming series ever, Beatmania 2DX, and that
144520	147120	particular track was from Beatmania Gold.
147120	149760	Playback Hate You was the name of that song.
149760	153280	And Loki was saying it's a pretty awesome song that should be in another game he was
153280	154280	thinking of.
154280	155280	There you have it.
155280	156280	All right.
156280	158600	Well, speaking of games, so we got a lot of gaming news tonight.
158600	159960	We got interview tonight.
159960	160960	Tommy Tallarico's here.
160960	164680	He's going to be joining us during part B, but first we got to start the show as we always
164680	167640	do with a little bit of how is your gaming week?
167640	169400	Dark Soccer, what'd you play this week?
169400	175800	I downloaded the, um, when we were at, uh, Weebie Toys, AKA Toys R Us, um, I downloaded
175800	182160	the Iron Man DS game demo and, um, it kind of sucked, but the controls were really cool.
182160	185160	I mean, the controls are kind of complicated, but they were pretty cool.
185160	186160	Okay.
186160	188640	So what, like, what are the controls kind of, can you describe it?
188640	191480	It's, well, you've got your, it actually moves up, left, down, right.
191480	195680	You know, just like any, you know, regular game doesn't do like flight commands, but
195680	199160	when you shoot and you touch the touch screen on your little radar pad and it controls the
199160	200160	direction you shoot.
200160	203760	So you could actually move your thumb all around and have them circle around and shoot
203760	205480	like that and still move in different directions.
205480	210120	So that part was cool and you pick up bombs and lock on, but it was fairly difficult from
210120	211120	the get go.
211120	214800	And honestly, that type of game needs a bigger screen.
214800	217280	So, uh, that didn't quite fly.
217280	218280	Okay.
218280	219280	Here's the game I was talking about.
219280	225600	It's Otomedius, which is a shooter game with, uh, cleavage heavy characters.
225600	229920	It's kind of a grottiest spinoff and it's in arcades in Japan right now.
229920	233840	And it's supposed to be coming to the Xbox 360 on September 25th in Japan.
233840	235280	All right, there you go.
235280	237320	So in high def on the 360.
237320	240000	Now comment from our chat room at chat.orangelandsradio.com.
240000	245920	This is J100 Matt going back to Iron Man says, and I thought Jamie was anti Tony Stark.
245920	249880	Only, only the, um, well, okay, I like the character.
249880	255440	I hate what a big dick he's been in the whole, you know, regular Marvel continuity, but I
255440	258960	like the character and the movie was pretty cool.
258960	261240	So the game, not nearly as cool as the movie.
261240	262240	No.
262240	263240	All right.
263240	264240	And I played imagine babies today.
264240	267640	I actually just gave it a try because my internet kept messing up.
267640	270360	So I was like, what's more torturous than not being able to go online?
270360	271360	Oh yeah.
271360	272360	Playing.
272360	273360	Imagine babies.
273360	274360	Hi.
274360	275360	That's me.
275360	278400	Glattov is appearing through the door.
278400	279700	He's going back to Kansas.
279700	284880	So he's waving goodbye forever, but, um, sorry, but it sucked.
284880	288280	I didn't want to wave the rattle at the stupid baby.
288280	291200	So um, wait, how does imagine babies works?
291200	293660	I picture it like Nintendogs the way you describe it.
293660	300280	Like instead of your friend and he's going to be your babysitting, um, instructor and
300280	304560	this woman comes by and by the way, it's like this funny cause she comes by, Oh, I usually
304560	309360	have granny babysit my babies, but you must be granny's granddaughter, but granny died.
309360	312920	So I'm like, what is this a stupid game?
312920	318160	It's for little children and I'm like, it's kind of cute, but I'm like, I don't want any
318160	319160	real children.
319160	320720	Why do I want fake children?
320720	327760	So because fake children, you can like do stuff too and CPS won't get called.
327760	328920	Don't let you do crap to them in the game.
328920	331200	You can't pick them up and throw them out the window.
331200	332200	Exactly.
332200	333600	You can't dangle them out the window.
333600	336720	All Michael Jackson's style in real life because that's wrong.
336720	338760	But in a video game you could do anything.
338760	346360	Well, at any rate, it sucked ass, um, and we moved to a new, uh, Ragnarok server because,
346360	351520	um, our old one, um, has sort of gone to shit.
351520	352520	Well that sucks.
352520	354800	I'm playing on void RO now.
354800	355800	They're pretty cool.
355800	357560	A lot cooler actually.
357560	359720	Very cool people run it.
359720	362760	So I, I'm done.
362760	363760	All right.
363760	364760	Oh.
364760	365760	Oh.
365760	366760	Oh.
366760	367760	Oh.
367760	368760	Okay.
368760	370720	So, um, left my ass off watching Dan play GTA four.
370720	372380	It was pretty fun.
372380	374600	What was so funny that happened?
374600	381380	It was just him talking crap about the guy's cousin in the game and about how all he wants
381380	385700	is, uh, is a big American boobs or something.
385700	386700	Nice.
386700	394380	So that game's kind of, it's, it's, it bothers me sort of, you know, but it's like a train
394380	396720	wreck and it's kind of funny cause you know the real world.
396720	403680	like that. Right. So, it's hilarious. Fear the Claw in chat.orangelandtrader.com
403680	407520	says, if Imagine Babies is like Nintendogs, does that mean you can pet
407520	411640	them to make them happy? That would be creepy. You can wave a rattle at them.
411640	416680	It's like the first thing that has you do is this, it shows you the baby and
416680	421460	there's like this dark background with a patch of light and you have to wave the
421460	425440	rattle in that patch of light as it moves around and the closer you stay in
425440	429160	the middle of it the happier the baby gets or some shit. So, don't go towards
429160	435800	the light! I won't get paid if you die! Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
435800	440460	It was alright. I didn't get to play as much because I've been working on web
440460	449160	pages. Anyways, um, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto IV, as usual. Still
449160	453280	fascinated by the stupid swing set. That's what we do during lunch now. That
453280	457200	and fire rockets at each other with friendly fire turned off so that we just
457200	462160	fly into the air and just take damage from the impact. I don't know, we're
462160	467680	easily amused. And then I also played over here actually the other day because
467680	471960	I got Rob a copy for his birthday and it's odd that I'm playing his copy of
471960	476500	the game before. I played mine, which I bought weeks ago, but Blastworks and we
476500	479960	actually played that a bit and that was funny because people are amused by it.
479960	484600	They're like, look at your ship! It's like taking up the whole screen! It was pretty
484600	488200	cool. I don't know. It's actually a pretty hard shooter. I had it on like
488200	493840	rookie, like the easiest setting. It was pretty fucking hard. So yeah, definitely
493840	497640	really cool. And I mean just with all the download content that's out there now
497640	501880	for it that people have made, it's nuts. The amount of stuff you can add to this
501880	505720	and completely change the game up. And you can also cheat really bad in it
505720	509080	because if you add your own custom ship you can change your bullet pattern to
509080	513240	like something absolutely crazy that just blows away the entire screen. And
513240	519320	Loki loves cheating! I do. And then I'm trying to think if I played anything
519320	524880	else. I don't think I did. I checked out, actually I checked out that uh, I don't
524880	528080	remember what it's called now. It's like some cooking guy can't decide what to eat or
528080	533880	whatever. It's alright. It's you know kind of a neat concept. Not really a game but
533880	538320	just you know recipe book. It teaches you how to do different you know techniques
538320	541880	and stuff and there's a lot of video and stuff in there. And plus you can make
541880	547800	your own shopping lists and stuff like that. So it's neat. I don't know. Not some
547800	554680	the recipes were kind of limited. I wish you could add your own. But I don't know.
554680	558880	It's it's a neat idea. It's something that needs to be done over here I think.
558880	561960	Although there was that Gourmet Chef game that came out over here. I don't
561960	566720	know what that is though. Lots of cooking games getting popular over here. You know
566720	569880	I was watching Hell's Kitchen very randomly the other day and there's a
569880	572680	Hell's Kitchen game they keep advertising during the show and I'm like
572680	577120	that can't be fun. That's a web game. It can't be fun. The real game is coming out
577120	582980	in September. Oh God. But the whole point of that show is to watch that guy say
582980	587780	fucking shit to all his you know chefs. I think. Break them. I think that game is
587780	592240	gonna be like those cafe games or like diner dash. I think it's
592240	597840	gonna be similar to that. Which kind of sucks if it's similar to that. It should be
597840	602200	just like kind of American Idol. What American Idol is the karaoke revolution.
602200	605480	You know where they berate you for sucking. That's what should be like
605480	610420	cookie mama but instead of mama will fix it. You're fucking lame! You suck! Take
610420	615940	this game back to the store cuz you suck! I'm coming to your house and killing you
615940	622200	and your family! Get out of my face! Fuck off! Yeah that's how that's how they show
622200	627320	us. That might be awesome. Anything else for your gaming week? No that's it. My
627320	631480	gaming week as Loki mentioned my birthday was this week yay and I got a
631480	635160	copy of blast works for my birthday and we were playing that a little bit the
635160	643440	other day and I I think it's kind of cute I like it it is a very hard shooter
643440	646720	at first but kind of once you get the hang of it I you have to there's a
646720	649640	certain delicate balance to it because you know you've probably heard this game
649640	654000	by now is based on Tamiki fighters right and basically like imagine katamari
654000	658400	damashi meets a shooter game as you destroy ships you can run over them and
658400	662040	attach them to your ship so as you can imagine the ship gets quite huge well
662040	665800	the trick is having to balance using the collapse button because there's a button
665800	669520	you can press that will collapse everything and make your ship very tiny
669520	673380	once again but if you do that then you can't add anything new to your ship so
673380	677000	there's a very delicate balance between you know collapsing and and all that
677000	680360	stuff that you have to do to kind of make your ship awesome but it's very
680360	684240	amusing I enjoyed that game I'm looking forward to seeing some of the custom
684240	686880	content because I haven't really dug into the game past a single-player
686880	692000	campaign so hopefully more on that in the future I was feeling a little bit
692000	695480	retro this week and it'll probably be explained why when we get into the news
695480	699840	a little later but I decided to go pick up an old GameCube game the Mega Man
699840	703360	anniversary collection I wanted to pick up because I was suddenly getting a
703360	706680	hankering for playing Mega Man again and I'm sure it's you we getting tonight's
706680	710120	news you'll understand why if you haven't already heard now I know there's
710120	712760	a lot of people that talk smack about the GameCube version of Mega Man
712760	716600	anniversary collection because the buttons are switched and you can't
716600	721280	really turn them you can't turn them around very easily but look let me put
721280	725760	it this way it cost me six bucks so it's hard to complain with that and I'm
725760	729240	having fun it's it's the old Mega Man games all over again I was playing a
729240	733080	little bit of Mega Man 8 because the anime scenes and Mega Man 8 are so
733080	738120	crappy and the voiceovers and stuff like I laugh every time it's awesome but I
738120	741640	want to go back and play the old-school Mega Man's too because you know they're
741640	743840	all there it's like Mega Man's one through eight and then the fighting
743840	747160	games you unlock too so the fighting games are kind of lame I got my work cut
747160	750800	out for me yeah I mean I've played them before on maim and I think they're on
750800	754840	game tap question mark I think they're on there I don't ever but I've
754840	758280	definitely played them before and they're okay oh they're on the um I
758280	761340	played them in the arcade because they're on the Ultra Kade even though
761340	766000	they were never released here they're on Ultra Kade like years ago I played it on
766000	771000	there so there you go that was pretty much my gaming week I didn't play a
771000	776340	whole lot else Wow guitar hero like I had to play the new Warcraft song I
776340	779960	don't know if that's in the news tonight so we'll get to that later and all that
779960	784120	it's good times so speaking of gaming news we'll get to that in just a moment
784120	789120	first some quick housekeeping all games comm is currently down from what I
789120	792680	understand there was a virus something that hit the server computer I don't
792680	795800	know the details because I'm not much of a tech person obviously if you're
795800	798760	listening live tonight then you figured out that you can go to all games radio
798760	803400	comm to listen to us or you probably have the URL of the feed saved in iTunes
803400	806720	or what have you so it's made it very easy to listen to show I'm told all

905200	911400	the the Argonaut I think is what it's called it's right there off right near
911400	917320	Pier 39 so I had the swing you know going to that because I want free stuff
917320	922400	there are going to be crap loads of all games radio people at PAX this year from
922400	926640	what I understand I know DMN our buddy who's on under station live now is going
926640	929800	to be there I know Bobby Blackwell's going I'm sure folks from AGI are gonna
929800	932880	be there I'm sure Scott's gonna be there I hear Kirk Hopkins coming in from the
932880	937120	UK and those are just the people I talk to semi regularly I don't even yeah from
937120	940280	the other shows I'm sure there's gonna be even more I there will inevitably be
940280	944840	a get-together of some sort I'm sure yeah I wish I could go but I don't know
944840	949920	if I can and we'll bring cider for you we'll see with alcohol and cider for me
949920	953720	and the kids all right anyhow so we'll like more details on that as packs
953720	958480	approaches let's get into some gaming news I want to Oh Bobby Blackwell says
958480	962160	Scott is actually not going to be there because he's at Burning Man okay wait a
962160	968200	minute he's passing up packs to go run naked in the desert come on lame actually
968200	971400	it does sound kind of fun I don't know burning blowing stuff I was pretty fun
971400	974600	no actually Burning Man does sound kind of cool I think that's one of the things
974600	978020	I want to do at some point before I die is go to burning man at least once even
978020	984360	though me plus Sun equals not good like I get all gross and my skin doesn't yeah
984360	988280	I'd like it was a redhead let's say redheads don't do well in Sun so he
988280	992280	starts to melt I understand that if I went to Burning Man I think I could only
992280	998680	go for like a day so there you go all right all right let's get into the news
998680	1002280	and the beat the big exciting thing I was alluding to earlier that made me all
1002280	1006820	retro this week right Logie yes definitely according to the brand new
1006820	1013280	issue of Nintendo Power Mega Man 9 is set to come to the Nintendo WiiWare
1013280	1019760	service and the best part about it is it's gonna be an old-school 2d and it's
1019760	1025840	a kind of like the traditional Mega Man games with actually the retro graphics
1025840	1029160	so it looks like something that could have been you know almost like a Mega
1029160	1035240	Man you know for something like that you know or Mega Man 3 very like NES but you
1035240	1041920	know better color palette type stuff so awesome and they had some screenshots
1041920	1047160	that like leaked out there I think scans from the issue but it looks cool very
1047160	1053280	cool and the first female boss robot yes they did had they did have a list of the
1053280	1057960	different bossmen that you'd be fighting now they have magma man galaxy man plug
1057960	1069080	man what does plug man plug curiosity concrete man and splash woman all right
1069080	1074040	making a splash the first female boss character although I think I heard I
1074040	1077840	don't know I might be getting missed next mixed up but I think in Japan one
1077840	1080880	of them was a woman in a pretty prior game and it got somehow switched on the
1080880	1084240	way over here to America I could be wrong on that don't call me on that but
1084240	1086760	I want to say somebody was telling me that but that's still what do you guys
1086760	1090440	think about this is interesting because Mega Man series is essentially taking a
1090440	1095160	step backwards but in a way it's a step forwards right it's awesome I think it's
1095160	1099520	a great idea mm-hmm they should do that for more stuff you know well they kind
1099520	1105440	of are I mean look at bionic commando rearmed you know it's not exactly as
1105440	1109720	old-school as like you know Mega Man as far as the way they're doing it but you
1109720	1114200	know same type of thing it's a 2d game I I don't you know they kind of forget
1114200	1117760	that a lot of times even though we do have the technology to do 3d games and
1117760	1122160	stuff you don't always have to do that amen what do you think our soccer you
1122160	1127160	excited about this fairly so yeah I hear all the music's gonna be like 8-bit ish
1127160	1131760	and all that stuff it's gonna be great I don't know DJ Dark Knight in our chat
1131760	1137520	room might not agree a worst Mega Man boss names ever so he does nothing but
1137520	1141160	I'm thinking okay they're probably running out I mean they're on their
1141160	1144800	ninth game at like nine bosses a game so you know a lot of the good ones have
1144800	1149520	probably been used Tiger Claw says it's all about the nostalgia I kind of agree
1149520	1153120	it's it's an interesting thing they're tapping into there I just think it's
1153120	1157520	really kind of interesting that you know Mega Man 8 was on the PlayStation and
1157520	1161120	had you know a more advanced look for that time and had the anime clips and
1161120	1165120	everything it's very interesting that instead of Mega Man 9 being a follow-up
1165120	1169540	and evolving that they really took a step backwards to when Mega Man was at
1169540	1174040	its peak most people would tell you you know Mega Man 2 & 3 were probably the
1174040	1176680	peak of the series a lot of people would tell you you know I'm sure there's some
1176680	1179880	hardcore Mega Man people out there they're like no seven or five or
1179880	1183200	whatever but you know I think a lot of us fondly fondly remember two and three
1183200	1187720	so that's kind of interesting they're going back but I know I'm gonna check it
1187720	1191960	out because if it's retro hopefully that means it's cheap and I like cheap
1191960	1196880	probably not but I could see this being like ten bucks I would pay ten dollars
1196880	1201400	for it if it's decent because I'm thinking it's gonna be a little spiced
1201400	1203840	up it's not just gonna be strictly like I don't think it's something you could
1203840	1206840	dump on a Nintendo card and play I think there'll be some extra little things to
1206840	1212320	it I think it'd be cool I just hope there's I just hope there's room for it
1212320	1216920	on the Wii cuz here's my other problem is I still have the whole other issue
1216920	1220080	going on where I can't download anything to my Wii right now no matter how cool
1220080	1225120	this sounds so this is this is me being tempted right here but hopefully our
1225120	1231280	space concerns will be addressed soon so couple more weeks until our Wi-Fi fixed
1231280	1235200	so I can download so you can actually download a Wii games yeah there you go
1235200	1238440	telling you a castle crash or not castle crashes yeah that game is gonna be
1238440	1243120	awesome too but that defend your castle awesome WiiWare game
1243120	1247480	Sharon said chat says soon we're gonna have pencil man and cloth man hey I
1247480	1251320	don't know pencil man might be kind of funny like he shoots erasers oh it's
1251320	1255880	like okay they've got to always have a you know a villain that's you know fire
1255880	1259680	base so they're like running out of different words for fire in there like
1259680	1267420	magma man and you know fire man heat man hot man way go man way go man was cool
1267420	1272000	though he was like the coolest of the email is pretty cool I don't know I'm
1272000	1278280	old-school I like fire man I say they make a new mega man game just have all
1278280	1282000	of the different bosses in there like all of them and they have all their
1282000	1285640	levels and yeah just have like well not necessarily playing all the bosses but
1285640	1288080	just have all the levels from all the other games too so you can use that
1288080	1290160	something from that's what the anniversary collection should have been
1290160	1293200	you should use like you can use the weapons from like making man 8 and make
1293200	1298840	a man 1 and you know mix it all up that'd be awesome and ossifer makes the
1298840	1305240	mandatory booby man reference j-rod says toaster man there you go j-rod says
1305240	1310280	powdered toast man all right I was just thinking all right enough enough I do
1310280	1314400	not want the chat room filling up with blank man or whatever there all right
1314400	1318600	um no blank man was already done was there a blank man really there was a
1318600	1323720	blank man movie all right well guess what if you have been hiding under a
1323720	1328960	freaking rock this week I don't know if you heard but Diablo 3 was announced and
1328960	1332360	we're playing a little bit of it here in studio right now a clip of what this
1332360	1338760	game looks like and you know places thick with the stench of ghouls what can
1338760	1342600	I say it looks like Diablo 2 and Diablo 1 but like much prettier it's obvious
1342600	1346800	this this game has evolved quite a bit this game of course was unveiled at
1346800	1352840	blizzard's recent event over in France the worldwide invitational and tons of
1352840	1356320	stuff was leaked there was a trailer there's this 20-minute gameplay clip
1356320	1359800	we're looking at here in studio right now what do you guys think of Diablo 3
1359800	1363760	I know you guys don't play a whole lot of PC games but what do you guys think
1363760	1368200	that's pretty cool I'd have to check it out I mean I never played any of the
1368200	1373600	others but I've had this one I played a little bit of I think Diablo like back
1373600	1377840	in the day when I had to demo and stuff for it and it was fun it was one of
1377840	1380920	those games you could sit there and play for a while you level up some and then
1380920	1385120	stop and go back to it later it's kind of like the whole grinding part of World
1385120	1388400	of Warcraft except you don't actually have any well as far as I'm working
1388400	1392040	because I only played the demo like huge quests you have to go on it's just grind
1392040	1395360	grind grind grind grind oh look I'm super powerful now kill kill kill and
1395360	1398560	you do have quest but part of the really cool thing about the old Diablos is that
1398560	1402040	everything was randomized you know all the day by introducing a barbarian I'm
1402040	1404600	gonna turn that off because now the guy is talking about the barbarian class on
1404600	1408960	it um all the dungeons were randomized so it was like you were playing like a
1408960	1411720	new game every time that was kind of one of the cool things about it
1411720	1419280	Guild Wars does that but yeah that's true huh so very cool but you know I
1419280	1422320	don't know Diablos just different Diablos not really an MMO but it is
1422320	1425160	something you can experience with tons of other people which is kind of cool I
1425160	1428200	do like the four player co-op that they're gonna have in there oh yeah
1428200	1433120	because then Diablo to only go up to two player co-op I think thing I remember so
1433120	1436320	there you have it Diablo 3 officially announced this week and there's just
1436320	1439240	their stuff all over the internet on this if you want the official word
1439240	1443400	Diablo 3.com is where it's I just go to any blizzard site that whole splash
1443400	1448480	screen that was being teased all week long was there as far as when this comes
1448480	1452120	out who knows because we still have Starcraft 2 on the list we still have
1452120	1457920	wrath of the Lich King when sometime that's really SSJ 100 Matt says it'll
1457920	1462700	be on my Hanukkah list for 2011 it's probably not a bad bet I would say
1462700	1466920	maybe 2010 I think we'll get Starcraft 2 next year and probably Diablo 3 the year
1466920	1470400	after I think I think Diablo 3 probably come out around the same time as
1470400	1475760	Starcraft 2 I think you may have one in the fall one spring j-rod says Diablo
1475760	1479680	was cool until people started cheating to make their own loot and I hear that's
1479680	1483360	a real problem that played Diablo 2 on battle net this is why I don't like to
1483360	1486880	play games except with friends you know because I know that friends won't cheat
1486880	1490560	or olr listeners I don't know you know cheating sometimes it can be fun because
1490560	1495000	like with red alert command and conquer red alert I love that stuff man they
1495000	1498400	especially when you found out about the whole rules I and I file and you can
1498400	1502120	make your own units by like combining stuff that made the game even more fun
1502120	1505720	for me but it's like if you and I agree okay we're gonna play this game or you
1505720	1508240	cheat the hell out of it and just have fun with it that's one thing I mean
1508240	1510960	that's cool because we're both on the same page but you know if I've worked
1510960	1514520	really hard to like level this character and then some stranger pops in my room
1514520	1519560	and dumps all this shit in my you know thing that he's cheated to get or shown
1519560	1523120	off or whatever that's just dumb yeah I mean like what are you trying to prove
1523120	1526680	the sort of the problem that we had I guess at the last Ragnarok server we
1526680	1530720	were on that people were a sort of exploiting a little problem in there
1530720	1534840	duplicating items and things and messing up the economy and and as a result all
1534840	1542280	of us suffered for it you know so yeah cheaters suck I think that there's not
1542280	1546100	a bar is appropriate to be cheating yeah what Matt's talking about you know like
1546100	1548320	you know and what they do at work and everything when they're you know
1548320	1551840	whatever that's that's one thing is you all agree you're gonna cheat and the
1551840	1555080	whole point you're having fun with the exploits but you know these other
1555080	1558880	a-holes that come on and try to ruin other people's you know legit experiences
1558880	1562720	suck well I would say it's it's less of a cheat more of a mod because you're
1562720	1566320	just modifying the game and in order to play someone because this is back in the
1566320	1572400	day when I was playing someone red alert over you know a fucking modem so you
1572400	1577100	know we would share the same file back and forth and then basically play this
1577100	1581360	you know kind of hacked version on both computers which was pretty fun actually
1581360	1587560	especially with you know I made the super fast tanks and Einstein the shot
1587560	1592400	lightning and you know the suicide bombers and stuff like that that's great
1592400	1597240	looking in chat here hit stun says funny I play with olr listeners because they
1597240	1600680	hack just as much as I do well you know again if you all agree you're going to
1600680	1604760	hack then you know that's one thing but it's just when you try to kind of cross
1604760	1608840	the line there where you're an ass if you if you're trying to ruin other
1608840	1613480	people's experience so but that's I hey you know what Diablo 3 is definitely
1613480	1616880	this you think it's going to break the Diablo 2 record I want to say if I
1616880	1622680	remember right Diablo 2 has the best PC game launch ever even above World of
1622680	1626000	Warcraft it sold Diablo 2 sold like a million copies in its first week is
1626000	1633240	Diablo 3 gonna top that or is PC gaming dead I don't know I heard you know read
1633240	1639160	enough fangasming on my live journal to make me think that if that's just a
1639160	1643280	small portion of the community I think that it would be big I think it's
1643280	1646160	definitely any of Diablo 2 for running for its money and I don't think PC
1646160	1649960	gaming is dead I think that I think there's enough people I think gaming is
1649960	1653800	mapping here yeah I don't even think it's necessarily you know there's
1653800	1657960	certainly a hardcore audience very into PC gaming but I'll tell you what you
1657960	1661840	know love them or hate them whoever you are in the PC gaming community Blizzard
1661840	1667120	gets people to the PC you know with games like this and World of Warcraft
1667120	1670480	there's other games too I'm not just saying like only Blizzard but you know
1670480	1674520	they're they they get people excited about it that you know you only see that
1674520	1678680	level of excitement for things like Metal Gear Solid 4 and so on and so on
1678680	1685560	all right so Diablo 3 coming soon well going back to other Blizzard news there
1685560	1690480	you know there were some people who were afraid that Diablo 3 would steal
1690480	1697600	World of Warcraft players but Blizzard really isn't worried about that because
1697600	1701400	well the thing is they're actually just not concerned about losing the revenue
1701400	1705240	because if they go from one of their projects to another of their projects
1705240	1710760	they're still getting money from it but they said that it's not going to be as
1710760	1714120	big of a crossover between the communities because they're different
1714120	1718920	you know types of game but they do hope that plenty of the World of Warcraft
1718920	1722920	players would be interested in Diablo 3 I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of
1722920	1726440	people to play both but I think some I think a lot of people will take a siesta
1726440	1731440	from Warcraft for a little while to play Diablo 3 well either way Blizzard gets
1731440	1734520	their money yeah true then they'll get it twice because how many of those
1734520	1738720	people will actually let their accounts expire probably not a lot no probably
1738720	1741680	not because you know I can't because you know Irene might call me and be all Rob
1741680	1747240	Cara and I'm gonna have to drop Diablo 3 to go run Cara's and again so Curtis and
1747240	1752280	chat is addressing the whole issue about PC gaming and he says I have portal on
1752280	1756600	my PC because unfortunately I'm still stuck with a ps2 and can't afford next
1756600	1760360	gen which you know I think there's a lot of people still doing PC gaming because
1760360	1764840	of that but I gotta be honest I look at a game like Diablo 3 and I'm going I'm
1764840	1767440	probably gonna have to upgrade my computer in order to be able to play
1767440	1770000	that I don't know Blizzard sometimes pretty good at getting the tech
1770000	1773640	requirements pretty low but I'm a little worried I'm gonna have to upgrade the
1773640	1776240	computer to be able to play that so if you have upgrade the computer isn't that
1776240	1780560	just like you know my soul by a system but it's like buying a few systems yeah
1780560	1783560	but I understand that you know some people want to put it all I want you
1783560	1787480	know then invest all the money in your best machine I think that's the big
1787480	1790000	reason why there are a lot of people really into PC gaming yeah kind of the
1790000	1795880	same it's the same thing yet opposite for me because because I've upgraded my
1795880	1801120	system I have to buy more PC games because you know what's the point in
1801120	1806000	upgrading it that much to play games if you're not gonna play games on it so
1806000	1809080	well I I don't think Blizzard is really gonna be losing any Wow players to
1809080	1811920	Diablo I don't think Blizzard will really start losing Wow players until
1811920	1815760	other MMOs come out that really step up to challenge them which you know Age of
1815760	1819040	Conan is probably done better than most so far and there's others you know I
1819040	1822640	think Warhammer is gonna be coming soon I've heard a lot of buzz about that and
1822640	1827160	eventually Wow 2 or World of Starcraft which in five years is probably
1827160	1834160	inevitable so we'll see what they need is like world of dead or alive keep on
1834160	1839640	dreaming it got you man he he can do it one thing that's gonna be coming
1839640	1843160	hopefully pretty soon here and we've been hearing about this for a while now
1843160	1850800	is the trophy system for the PlayStation 3 kind of their answer to the
1850800	1855440	achievements that are on Xbox 360 well there are some pictures that have leaked
1855440	1860040	out supposedly of this trophy system they show that you're actually not gonna
1860040	1864680	have gamer points but they're gonna have different trophies available in bronze
1864680	1869960	silver gold and platinum and you're in the trophies and different ways
1869960	1874360	throughout the game and stuff there's also some interesting stuff they're
1874360	1879560	showing the in-game cross-media bar kind of showing how you can compare your
1879560	1884000	trophies with other people and you know kind of the same kind of stuff we've
1884000	1888720	come to take for granted with like the Xbox 360 where you can see who's online
1888720	1893600	your friends listen that kind of stuff so it's all supposed to come down in the
1893600	1899960	2.4 firmware so whenever the hell that comes out so basically it sounds like
1899960	1903360	the achievement system I don't know it kind of reminds me of like burnout you
1903360	1906320	know that's it we're like if you get a certain time you get a gold if you get a
1906320	1910000	certain you know higher time it's a silver and so on for a bronze they're
1910000	1913560	gonna have that type of well I think what's gonna be is lay some difficulty
1913560	1919000	for each trophy it's not going to be like you know I guess sort of like that
1919000	1922520	but you wouldn't be able to like say get golden and get all the trophies below it
1922520	1926040	it would be just like different things like finish level one bronze trophy
1926040	1929520	finish the game you know gold trophy or something like that gotcha I read you
1929520	1932720	some more comments from chat chat orange lunch radio.com live on this Sunday
1932720	1936520	night j-rod says trophies and achievements god no I can't juggle that
1936520	1942580	between two systems achievement whore also going back to the last story you
1942580	1946040	were joking that idagaki should get in on World of Warcraft because for some
1946040	1949680	reason idagaki has been like the big thing to talk about on shows lately and
1949680	1953860	I thought this comment was kind of funny from Amaze Satsuma he says doesn't
1953860	1961480	Conan equal world of dead or alive parts it is violent and there are you know
1961480	1968480	well-endowed women on there so possibly parts yeah parts all right well you know
1968480	1972640	all these games are pretty epic and there is another epic series that could
1972640	1978840	be getting some more epicness at e3 this year and that series is God of War and
1978840	1983720	you know you know it's inevitable that God of War 3 is going to come out
1983720	1988000	sometime for the PlayStation 3 but were you guys thinking that it might be this
1988000	1993320	soon well apparently one of the Eurogamer affiliates Eurogamer.pt has
1993320	1999480	run a report that God of War 3 is going to be shown at e3 this next month this
1999480	2004080	was from a Sony rep at the interactive digital I'm sorry interactive and
2004080	2009040	digital entertainment festival going on in Paris right now so even though this
2009040	2014400	is a rumor status I don't know this to me this is one of those rumors that yeah
2014400	2017480	you could probably bank on something like this I mean like even if even if
2017480	2022000	this site Eurogamer or whatever hadn't run this I would put my money on you
2022000	2024960	know God of War 3 is going to be announced eventually they're gonna
2024960	2028280	they're gonna have like some sort of trailer or something it could be just
2028280	2033800	all cutscene or whatever that says you know God of War 3 coming 2009 or
2033800	2037000	something like that you know well apparently rumors are already saying
2037000	2041160	that the launch is going to be next Christmas but some are actually saying
2041160	2045240	a more placeholder release of next March I kind of see this if a trailer is
2045240	2048520	unveiled which I don't see why it wouldn't be because this is one of Sony's
2048520	2053000	biggest franchises it's going to be in the vein of the early early Halo 3
2053000	2055760	trailers where it's going to show you like you know there's going to be some
2055760	2060880	epic music and then you know some girl talking like you know in a land far away
2060880	2064000	we need your help or whatever shit they're going to talk in the thing and
2064000	2068840	then you'll see suddenly at the very end of the trailer Kratos's face in HD and
2068840	2074440	it's going to be like oh my god and then God of War 3 2009 and that's going to be
2074440	2078920	it I mean you know it's kind of predictable at this point where then
2078920	2081880	again if it is Sony they could say it's coming out this Christmas and then just
2081880	2086360	keep pushing it back until it's the Christmas 2009 it is the Sony way isn't
2086360	2090960	it did you hear about the other rumor that they're saying that Kratos is gonna
2090960	2096160	be a hidden character in Soulcalibur 4 on the PlayStation 3 I had heard that I
2096160	2098760	think it was on the lineup for tonight but I got cut because we're gonna be
2098760	2102440	long otherwise but yeah I'd heard about that in that weird uh it'd be
2102440	2105400	interesting to be something that they could probably slip in there for e3 or
2105400	2108120	whatever since the game comes out a few weeks after that but I would think isn't
2108120	2112480	if that is true wouldn't wouldn't word of that already slipped out now not
2112480	2115680	really I mean look at the you know they've been announcing stuff each week
2115680	2120440	you know like a little tidbits you know doing different screens like they were
2120440	2124200	talking about the tag system that's supposedly in there now there's another
2124200	2128560	thing I saw the other day for the custom the character creator where you can
2128560	2133400	basically create they have someone made like a solid snake and then our old
2133400	2141960	snake basically and re are Ryu Ryu from Ninja Gaiden so if you're the claw and
2141960	2146320	Chad says that's three games in three years it's like Tony Hawk or Madden and
2146320	2149600	then I'm thinking wait a minute there's the PSP one but J rod jumps in and says
2149600	2153040	yeah but the PSP one doesn't count for most people I heard the PSP one was
2153040	2155520	actually pretty good I didn't play it myself I can see them probably in the
2155520	2160240	guy probably will port the PSP one to the PlayStation 2 before the third one
2160240	2166480	comes out hmm we'll see because they've been doing that quite often well I'm I
2166480	2169760	think it's inevitable God of War 3 at some point we'll just see if we get a
2169760	2176640	teaser at e3 or not well there is some other news that should probably be
2176640	2181440	pretty exciting I'm actually kind of exciting about exciting about it excited
2181440	2188860	about this is Nintendo Power put up an image of a photo taken of the
2188860	2193080	Castlevania game for Wii and it looks like a fighting game and not a
2193080	2200000	platformer but it said so far you should be able to well at least it's a it's a
2200000	2203620	rumored that you should be able to play Simon alucard
2203620	2210040	Shannoah Marie Renard and Dracula it do it better it better have Richter in it
2210040	2214320	that's all I'm saying but doesn't look like a it's like a fighting game it was
2214320	2218880	like a family so caliber is so so is this Konami's response to Soul Calibur
2218880	2225160	maybe gs68 calls it fightervania and then facepalms in our chat room it's
2225160	2229760	Castlevania judgment I think was the name of the name III I want I want to
2229760	2235000	play it here's here's my my quandary with this is that this looks like one of
2235000	2240400	those things that could be really really really freaking awesome or really
2240400	2244480	really really terrible you know what I mean like and I'm just kind of worried
2244480	2249720	it's going to be terrible but I have I hope I'm hopeful because these are some
2249720	2257200	great characters here and and shapely legs what do you think now here's the
2257200	2261280	thing aren't don't most of the Castlevania characters play kind of
2261280	2263660	similar like what's going to differentiate all these different
2263660	2268760	characters Richter had different moves remember he had the the backwards double
2268760	2272360	jump and he had no he had the well if you go by somebody in the night he had
2272360	2277100	like the double jump and then the the one where he leaps up and then the the
2277100	2282260	backflip that would let you go like an extra space and a half and like if you
2282260	2285760	put Maria and I don't know if she'd have her crybaby attack from when she was a
2285760	2289280	little girl I did see a screenshot that they had Maria in it yeah there's a
2289280	2293760	second screenshot that was floating around out there also you know what
2293760	2297920	would be kind of cool is if certain boss characters were kind of downgraded to
2297920	2301600	you know the playable fighters in this so you could like play as the grim
2301600	2306440	reaper or you could play as I don't know the vampire bat maybe not or Medusa or
2306440	2309160	you know some of those like old-school Castlevania bosses that might be kind of
2309160	2313040	fun and it's just me I think that'd be fun to play as like the grim reaper as a
2313040	2319880	character well or Dracula I would think that if Dracula is in a Dracula isn't it
2319880	2325280	as a boss bosses are always playable once you unlock them though they should
2325280	2331320	have they should have shaft the dark priest shaft so like and they're like
2331320	2337200	little text exchange should be like he's like yeah we hear your one bad and then
2337200	2341960	you shut your mouth I I hope that they have horrendous voice acting like the
2341960	2347280	old-school PlayStation Symphony of the night game that would rock I just think
2347280	2352800	that Simon had pretty hair in that one picture I imagine this is something that
2352800	2357480	will get a trailer of at e3 so hopefully we'll get a little more feeling about if
2357480	2361400	this is gonna suck or not I again I'm hopeful but it is one of those things
2361400	2365320	where it's like boy they could really screw this up if they wanted to so I I
2365320	2368760	hope they took the time to get it right we'll see yeah unfortunately can't see
2368760	2373440	that the track record for spin-off games have been that great for the like
2373440	2377720	especially on the Wii because I mean look look what they've done Soulcalibur
2377720	2385160	legends absolute shit there was well Mortal Kombat sort of did like a little
2385160	2389440	action game which wasn't that great the Shaolin monks but the Shaolin monks was
2389440	2392560	kind of cool but what sucked was that sub-zero mythologies game yeah those
2392560	2397360	games yeah Shaolin monks was alright what it was what was the Tekken game
2397360	2402880	Tekken oh the oh god there was the spin-off with Nina right there was death
2402880	2413440	by degrees yeah oh yeah that was shit guilty gear to overture it's alright but
2413440	2418400	it's kind of like 99 nights a bit and then trying to think there's another one
2418400	2424360	there but yeah it hasn't been that great so cross our fingers dark Tetsuya says I
2424360	2428040	want to play as grant from Castlevania 3 he could climb on the freaking walls
2428040	2431280	and ceiling I'll be kind of Japanese version instead of just stabbing with
2431280	2436120	the knife he actually threw knives see this a lot better these are the kind of
2436120	2439280	characters that need to be in the game you know and I have say you know we
2439280	2442640	might be talking negatively about this game already has a very cautious but by
2442640	2449240	all means please Konami prove us wrong make us eat our words please please feel
2449240	2453020	free you know what the graphics don't look that bad so if they want to do say
2453020	2458440	another 2d Castlevania game for the Wii which would be awesome they should do
2458440	2461540	that all right hey let's travel around the world and talk about some games
2461540	2465860	coming out a little sooner than e3 like this week yeah if only Castlevania
2465860	2468480	judgment we're coming out this week because this week sucks for game
2468480	2473560	releases isn't this usually a dead period though right before you get a lot
2473560	2479400	of little bit yeah so basically today you have guitar hero Aerosmith which I'm
2479400	2483400	sure a lot of people picked up other than today there's really a whole lot of
2483400	2491120	nothing elements on PC which is some puzzle game supreme ruler 2020 also
2491120	2499800	another PC game that's a strategy title let's see the immortals of Terra I have
2499800	2505840	no idea what that is journey to the center of the earth for the DS which is
2505840	2511360	based on the new movie that's coming out here they keep trailering like crazy one
2511360	2519160	versus 100 the only game with Bob Saget in it it's for the DS until they make a
2519160	2522840	full house game yes which will never happen
2522840	2527680	rugu on purely sorry about that I'm looking at a banner god damn these
2527680	2532560	banner ads that make noise I hate that anyways rugu on PC cool independent
2532560	2537160	games so that's worth checking out purpals on the Wii yet another cat
2537160	2544120	raising sim or cats raising you sim Gears of War the refresh as they're
2544120	2547600	calling it basically the re-release of Gears of War with some extra content and
2547600	2555640	a new price point of $39.99 that's on the 360 dakati moto on the DS motorcycle
2555640	2562840	racing game amf bullying pin busters that's on the DS as well hail to the
2562840	2570120	chimp on the ps3 the only game that's actually cool this week trauma center
2570120	2577920	under the knife to coming out for the DS and that's it
2577920	2585840	wow some comments from chat kdog 96 asks hasn't won versus 100 being canceled no
2585840	2590000	I know I think the show was oh the show show was but you know if they made the
2590000	2593240	game I think they're kind of stuck releasing it yeah the game has been
2593240	2597240	pushed back a while some comments on guitar hero Aerosmith dead man walking
2597240	2601680	in chat says guitar hero Aerosmith is awful j rod says guitar hero Aerosmith
2601680	2605160	has a great track list but I can't get myself to support Activision milking
2605160	2611520	that franchise you know there's a large part of me that really wants to get
2611520	2616440	guitar hero Aerosmith but I cannot justify $60 on it I just can't so I'm
2616440	2620040	hoping it comes down to price so you can complain at my house oh that's right
2620040	2623560	cuz Dan's gonna get it huh I mean it's a good thing that they're releasing you
2623560	2627320	know music games and stuff like that but I think more than one release years too
2627320	2630680	much even with DDR if they were releasing like two or three games a year
2630680	2635720	that would be overkill I think all right let's head on over to Japan and look at
2635720	2638480	some of the release dates over there and honestly guys not a whole lot coming out
2638480	2641640	in Japan this week it's a pretty slow week there is one big game coming out
2641640	2645800	though it's on the PlayStation 3 its initial D extreme stage so if you're a
2645800	2648840	fan of those initial D racing games this is a good week for you in Japan that
2648840	2651600	game is coming out on July the 3rd otherwise there are some price
2651600	2654640	reductions I mean chant arm is finally getting a price reduction on the
2654640	2659160	PlayStation 3 as well as ninja guidance Sigma and ranch and clank future so
2659160	2662320	there are some price reductions let's check out some of the other systems I
2662320	2666680	know there's nothing coming on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan on the Wii Akko
2666680	2671760	de Pon ikisama Horiyuki is coming out and Jawa mammoth toe hitsumu no ishi is
2671760	2676600	also coming out I have no idea what either of those games are but I'm
2676600	2681320	imagine Akko de Pon is probably some type of puzzle game if I'm not mistaken
2681320	2685640	yeah it looks like oh it's a board game so board game translation for the
2685640	2689240	Nintendo Wii probably not a game we really play here on this side of the
2689240	2692960	ocean I'm looking at the handheld system actually quickly looking at PlayStation
2692960	2702440	2 some other price reductions there also L no kitsu to invisible memories comes
2702440	2706560	out on the PlayStation 2 it has a limited edition as well it's an
2706560	2713160	adventure game can't tell much about this but it has school girls in it well
2713160	2718440	I could be anything exactly I could be anything seriously looking at the
2718440	2722000	handhelds because there's usually stuff on the Nintendo DS even in a slow
2722000	2729440	newsweek I don't see a lot of big game names here but I do show a game called
2729440	2734240	the nashi no gamae from Square Enix is coming out trying to figure out what
2734240	2740480	that game is action-adventure game gosh that box art makes it look like some
2740480	2744160	type of survival horror that might be kind of cool it probably is from Square
2744160	2747880	Enix that might be kind of neat actually pinky Street
2747880	2752040	Kira Kira music hour comes out from dimple entertainment this week on the
2752040	2756840	Nintendo DS and it does look like a music game it's a rhythm action game
2756840	2760920	based on a series of three touch band panels that you interact with while the
2760920	2765960	beat rolls by you use the Nintendo DS sideways with a touch panel on one side
2765960	2769400	for the game and the other side showing a full body view of your dancer and her
2769400	2777080	competition woohoo so it's like a dance music game and lastly on the PSP in
2777080	2782540	Japan this week we're gonna see if there's anything new Oh bleach heat the
2782540	2787080	soul for gets a price reduction and moves into best hits and the Namco
2787080	2791760	museum battle collection expands to an Asia wide release this week and not just
2791760	2797160	Japan more bleach I was gonna say I have a friend who's touring around in Japan
2797160	2801120	right now and he asked me if I wanted anything from Japan so I was gonna have
2801120	2805680	them pick me up a copy on PlayStation 3 of battle Fantasia nice which is that
2805680	2810200	really cool looking fighting game I wanted to play that one of my other
2810200	2814320	friends is planning on importing it so hopefully I get that and I can bring it
2814320	2819040	in and we can do it on Justin TV or some by the way in two weeks in Japan since
2819040	2822120	we were talking about God of War earlier God of War chains of Olympus finally
2822120	2825040	comes out in Japan on July 10th something to look forward to there there
2825040	2834760	you have it Japan release dates well for the UK there's a few things on the 30th
2834760	2839800	actually go view is coming out for PSP and then with the start of the month
2839800	2844880	we've got on the second Dance Dance Revolution hottest party on Wii Wolf of
2844880	2848440	the battlefield a commando 3 for PlayStation 3 on the third and then on
2848440	2854480	the fourth is Arkanoid DS space invaders extreme for DS and PSP The Incredible
2854480	2859520	Hulk on Wii and wall-e on damn near everything else and we love golf only
2859520	2864040	wait it's not dancing stage hottest party this is dance dance revolution
2864040	2868920	that's kind of strange okay surprise it because I thought they called it dancing
2868920	2871680	stage over there why is it that they call it dancing and stage over there
2871680	2875400	anyways evolution is a taboo term to use in marketing from what I understand
2875400	2880320	haha I know why and if I'm right also back in the 80s you actually couldn't
2880320	2884360	use ninja like for example Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was Teenage Mutant
2884360	2890760	Hero Turtles we got weird stuff over here too so you know like you know bag
2890760	2895320	is a cigarette over there but over here means something much different you know
2895320	2900600	what I mean there's there's little and a bundle of sticks yes that's funny
2900600	2906800	revolution hey anyways so there's some other stuff coming out a little bit
2906800	2912360	later than next week but being announced from Nintendo some pretty exciting stuff
2912360	2916240	actually a brand new Wario Land game which I believe we talked about this a
2916240	2919120	little bit at least at leaked out that was coming
2919120	2926240	Wario Land shake it which is gonna be kind of like imagine Super Paper Mario a
2926240	2930800	little bit it's a classic side-scrolling game that will probably have you shaking
2930800	2937280	the Wii remote for random things but you know is basically I guess your quest to
2937280	2942840	collect money you know which most Wario games are it seems like also there's
2942840	2948760	going to be Kirby Superstar Ultra which is a DS remake of the Super Nintendo
2948760	2954240	game interesting was that the one with like all the mini games in it it's also
2954240	2960760	got many games in it yeah Wow okay and there's also I had that game
2960760	2968360	mystery case files millionaire like air as in you know errors anyways and that
2968360	2973080	is a mystery game that I guess is a PC franchise that they're now bringing to
2973080	2981800	the DS so those let's see I believe the September 25th for Kirby Superstar Ultra
2981800	2990000	and 29th for September 29th for mystery case files millionaire and I want to say
2990000	2998440	that Wario Wario Land is around the 29th as well and then also there's Super
2998440	3004280	Mario sluggers coming out on the 29th of August if I remember correctly some of
3004280	3008000	the some part of that last week of August the Tuesday now what I think is
3008000	3010880	interesting about this list is that you know it's interesting that Nintendo is
3010880	3014240	announcing this ahead of e3 because it's usually a type of stuff you'd reveal at
3014240	3019520	e3 but then I noticed a couple things a that list ends in October so there are
3019520	3023080	November and December releases are still a question mark so there might be some
3023080	3027040	big bombshell in there and it doesn't really even end in October it ends yeah
3027040	3031280	basically at October yeah because it's all September stuff because I don't know
3031280	3035120	like you know Wario sounds kind of cool go Kirby sure it has a lot of diehard
3035120	3039520	fans but there's not really that OMG title you know there you know it's also
3039520	3043200	weird and I mean this is weird for Nintendo because Nintendo usually
3043200	3048120	releases their stuffs on their games on Sundays they're switching to Tuesdays
3048120	3051640	now so they're finally getting normal like everybody else
3051640	3057240	yes I guess good for them well you know switching over to the Xbox 360 for a
3057240	3059760	minute it's been speculated for a while that one of the things that they are
3059760	3062920	going to announce at e3 along with all that you know news that got leaked last
3062920	3069800	month or knows about two weeks ago was the price drop the Xbox 360 you know any
3069800	3073480	day now should be getting some type of price drop and it looks like it might
3073480	3077720	happen at e3 that they might walk out there on stage and they're gonna say we
3077720	3081660	are dropping the price of the Xbox 360 here's what happened to make us all
3081660	3087320	think that is that apparently a Kmart ad has leaked it's a Kmart ad that is
3087320	3094000	actually supposed to hit on July 6th and this ad shows that there is an Xbox 360
3094000	3099320	20 gig console meaning it comes with the hard drive to $99.99 is being advertised
3099320	3103560	as a new low price also supporting the fact that this ad is for the week of
3103560	3107560	July 6th you see a little box art for civilization revolution as a game that's
3107560	3111080	coming out that week that is a game that's scheduled to be out that week so
3111080	3115600	very interesting that this could be seeing a $50 price drop from the current
3115600	3121240	$349 that folks are paying for this system we don't know if it's arcade or
3121240	3124600	something new it could be a new skill if I remember correctly though it's not
3124600	3129680	actually the six it's for the 13th is when this at all oh yeah there's a
3129680	3134080	higher-res scan of this ad near the very bottom it says like oh seven one three
3134080	3138280	is the like ad cereal or whatever on the bottom there but did nobody shops at K
3138280	3143720	Mart I think I understand that but if this is true then you know people are
3143720	3148040	gonna price match and what have you you know I it's it's not they're not gonna
3148040	3152040	all of a sudden drop their systems down for you know whatever it says new low
3152040	3158020	price not saying you know on sale SSJ 100 Matt says Rob do we get a rock us to
3158020	3164120	caucus t-shirt with our purchase of 360 a part that possibly you know what I
3164120	3168440	want one of those shirts who knows you might be able to buy some mole if you
3168440	3173560	want to mold the Xbox 360 that's the thing if Kmart ends up selling these I
3173560	3177200	it's got it better be for an old skewer house Kmart gonna get rid of all the
3177200	3181120	360s have been sitting on their shelves since launch because nobody shops at K
3181120	3185240	Mart I didn't get a price matched all right it doesn't matter they get all
3185240	3188780	that stuff in the back I was gonna say about that whole July 16 the early rumor
3188780	3192760	said that that was the date but you're right e3 is actually the week is 4th of
3192760	3196280	July weekend hello they're not gonna do e3 then e3 is the week after so yeah
3196280	3199360	would make more sense if that was the July 13th yeah but even then Civ
3199360	3202080	Revolution is probably the only big title I can think big big title on the
3202080	3205320	Xbox 360 I'm thinking of in the next couple weeks yeah like this Don King
3205320	3208680	price fighter if you look you know and I don't even know why I looked at this
3208680	3213360	one I I was looking at this ad here they have a high res scan on joystick if you
3213360	3220120	look at the very bottom left-hand corner it says job number 713 so that's when
3220120	3224120	the ad is supposed to hit I have a feeling somebody else another retailer
3224120	3227520	will leak a very similar thing this week and that's when you know it's the real
3227520	3231600	deal I already I'm already on board saying it's the real deal I think I mean
3231600	3236020	look it was it last year with the whole I think the first price drop and also
3236020	3240420	there was the PlayStation 3 stuff too I think that there was some sort of price
3240420	3244920	drop or skew announcement or something like that right by that right so I think
3244920	3249000	it was the 80 gig or something well there you have it a price drop coming
3249000	3252540	soon so if you haven't bought an Xbox 360 yet and you want to and I say this
3252540	3255300	because we've had some mailbag people write us recently wondering if they
3255300	3258960	should take the plunge and get one out maybe you should wait now a couple weeks
3258960	3263880	before this price drop unless you go to a store that's going to honor because
3263880	3267760	sometimes stores like at the price changes within a month they will give
3267760	3272120	you a refund I would rather try not risk it and just you know buy it just wait a
3272120	3276720	few more weeks just wait a couple more weeks and I think you will be good so
3276720	3281800	and then you might have a reason to shop at Kmart a reason to shop it came pick
3281800	3285700	up some of that hip 80s fashion while you're there I have bought something at
3285700	3289840	Kmart would you buy I bought something at Kmart once in the past three years
3289840	3293240	and that's because they were the only place open on Thanksgiving I bought
3293240	3298360	cereal there why did you have to get cereal at Kmart it was the Kmart's right
3298360	3303640	around the corner from my house and they actually had cranberry remember they had
3303640	3307280	the diet cranberries here I missed all right like a month after it had been
3307280	3312440	discontinued I think you can still get crystal Pepsi at Kmart actually really
3312440	3318440	okay no I'm like funny story last night for no apparent reason we were just
3318440	3324520	coming back from dropping off my sister from we went and saw Wally so Nellie was
3324520	3328720	a little bit hungry and so we decided to go to the 24-hour Walmart and you know
3328720	3333920	we went in there buying okay we only need aluminum foil and like you know a
3333920	3338320	snack and then that's it we ended up walking out with like aluminum or not
3338320	3341880	even aluminum foil because we forgot to get that obviously but we walked out
3341880	3348120	like bagel bites and like clothes and random shit it's like what the hell
3348120	3352680	what is wrong with this I did buy something important there what I bought
3352680	3357680	flannel sheets for my massage class I Kmart yeah cuz it was convenient see for
3357680	3364240	me have the Martha Stewart sheets there though did you know that Wow Wow I
3364240	3368240	almost live literally next door to a freaking Walmart and I don't go there
3368240	3374520	unless I have to because it's scary yes did you see this oh right over there by
3374520	3378440	the freeway they are opening up a Hooters right by my house go do we
3378440	3386400	should do our olr 300 episode live at Hooters I'm serious well we'll have to
3386400	3389200	look into it if they're not eating hot wings cuz our hot wings tastes like shit
3389200	3392520	we'll have to see if they have the facilities for that and if they're not
3392520	3395560	gonna charge us too much but otherwise I kind of like that idea of doing our
3395560	3403700	300th episode live for mooders we'll have to see pk jr. 92 asks how is it
3403700	3409100	scary Rob the Walmart over here just it's it's there's always like people
3409100	3413900	outside asking for money and you know and when you walk in there it smells
3413900	3418400	like formaldehyde I have a good way to describe it what think of the oldest
3418400	3425600	Walmart in this in the south and then transpose it to California not quite as
3425600	3433280	bad the floors are at least white but the quality of consumer sadly I think
3433280	3436480	the Kmart locally here is a little bit more ahead of the times in the Walmart
3436480	3441040	next really really the only difference between Walmart's and Kmart's is Kmart
3441040	3444840	you have to step on the pad to open the door instead of you know the infrared
3444840	3452440	all right enough Kmart chat back to gaming news we gotta we gotta we have
3452440	3460840	Tommy is waiting to come on our show we gotta get to him okay well hey we've got
3460840	3466440	some other stuff that's that's a pretty crap news for our friends in the UK
3466440	3473600	they're supposed to introduce a dual rating system for rating games one
3473600	3479120	that's the if I'm right it's the PEG I and the other one then to go with the
3479120	3487480	BBFC and anyway they were talking about the games that were rated 12 plus or
3487480	3492160	above by the PEG I should also be rated by the BBFC the British Board of Film
3492160	3497520	Classification to also include you know that which right now they only rate the
3497520	3505480	the 15 and 18 but there's but Microsoft is actually saying that it's going to
3505480	3509960	make the games more expensive because they have to submit them through both
3509960	3516600	rating systems as well as delay their releases because they have to be
3516600	3522720	approved by both so in fact it's a pretty much quote this it was actually
3522720	3530880	said by Neil Thompson who was one of the executives there that quote we're
3530880	3534320	concerned with any measures that would mean this process is made more unwieldy
3534320	3545600	or incurs additional costs which have to be shared with the consumer so so that's
3545600	3550880	kind of crap don't you think yeah kind of sucks that they have to do too I mean
3550880	3554560	I understand why you just can't stick with one rating system I know right it's
3554560	3560080	basically like well we need to rate it too well no then just have them rate
3560080	3566720	everything you're the Peggy system I don't see why we can't do this in
3566720	3569560	America and why they can't do it everywhere else at whatever wherever has
3569560	3574560	a movie rating system apply it to the games or just yeah have an equivalent
3574560	3580000	well we don't need an ESRB if people can understand what movie ratings are about
3580000	3586360	then apply it to video games as well yeah so stupid I know but people are
3586360	3594200	even dumber than that so they won't understand oh well so yet another
3594200	3600920	Microsoft rumor we've got here and it's kind of interesting but then again the
3600920	3607480	source is not entirely credible so take this with a huge grain of salt anyways
3607480	3612960	this was apparently found from the 4chan forums which I know that probably
3612960	3618600	already wow that's the most respectable news source I've ever I know I know I
3618600	3625240	know but just just reporting it that's all there are two screenshots that
3625240	3628480	supposedly leaked from 4chan yeah I know it's weird
3628480	3635200	dubbed my gamer pad and it's basically kind of like Microsoft's version of home
3635200	3640200	it looks like you know they've got the avatars this one screenshot shows they
3640200	3649280	can invite friends you know change your wardrobe of furnishings etc and then you
3649280	3654400	know the logo for it looks like it's drawing like crayon I don't know so big
3654400	3659240	grain of salt definitely big grain of salt that but I don't think there's
3659240	3666120	really excuse me I don't think there's really an excuse me I'm choking go ahead
3666120	3672520	yeah so who knows I mean it it could be very well photoshopped but you know with
3672520	3675320	these kind of announcements that you would be been hearing and leaks and
3675320	3679240	stuff about you know their avatar system and stuff like that I could definitely
3679240	3683500	see them doing something like this you know I think in the minute you said I'm
3683500	3686440	trying to get the nicest way to say this but I can't really like think of
3686440	3691040	anything with a minute you said this news comes to us from the 4chan forums
3691040	3696700	like the biggest grain of salt fell from the head like the entire salt lake
3696700	3705200	dumped here in studio when he said that yeah I when I think news I think CNN and
3705200	3714680	MSNBC I don't think fortune well okay just saying in case it actually becomes
3714680	3722360	true yeah exactly I love this comment from j-rod and chat 4chan Photoshop
3722360	3733480	never I know I know but just saying you know just in case it's true you heard it
3733480	3742760	here first you heard it's not true you heard it on the Bobby Black Wolf show
3742760	3751080	getting Bobby commercial for us heart heart heart heart alright anyhow it's
3751080	3758560	time for us to do something here on olr we haven't done in a while that's dance
3758560	3763840	no we have a stupid award giveaway tonight and tonight it's not because of
3763840	3768600	any of the hideous shooting or anything thankfully but this is just no plain
3768600	3773920	stupidity the news comes to us from the New Haven Advocate and it is about the
3773920	3781000	Connecticut State Senator Gail Slosburg Gail Slosburg is looking for the rape
3781000	3787000	scene in Grand Theft Auto form and going to the actual news article here on New
3787000	3791360	Haven advocate.com she wants confirmation of the rumored rape scene
3791360	3795840	in Grand Theft Auto for she is unable though to reach that level of the game
3795840	3802440	could it possibly be because I don't know it doesn't exist but she's she's
3802440	3808680	not willing to believe that but she just doesn't believe it surely this is a
3808680	3814240	grant that surely there must be rape I'm basically she was that she was putting
3814240	3819760	out a request that someone proved to her that's not in there well that that's
3819760	3828520	often logic is that if you're innocent prove that there is no rape in your game
3829920	3839640	need I say more you're an idiot this is why politicians suck not all but most
3839640	3845440	like this one they suck once they get to a certain level yeah let us know when
3845440	3849040	you find that scene you know but the funny thing is is that she's going to be
3849040	3852840	going around forever and ever trying to find that scene and she never will so
3852840	3858080	heaven forbid she actually gets some work done oh speaking of Grand Theft Auto
3858080	3863920	for though I did see the most hilarious thing in that the lab dances what
3863920	3870600	they're hilarious so badly animated I was gonna say she's gonna find the lost
3870600	3874160	city of gold before she finds that rape scene in there maybe she can find a
3874160	3877240	balanced budget for the state of Connecticut I don't know I don't know if
3877240	3880480	they have the budget problems we do in California but if this were coming from
3880480	3883880	a California senator I would be going through the freaking roof because they
3883880	3887200	cannot balance a fucking budget in this state I would be I would be in the
3887200	3890120	middle of the roof right now it's in Connecticut do you really need to lower
3890120	3896200	yourself to Delaware's level I mean seriously all right you know what news
3896200	3901520	like this makes us a you know what fuck it it's the F use of the week
3907600	3911840	if you to me for using the wrong music tonight oh well bit of retroness for you
3911840	3918580	guys Jamie if you love um I have a few so I'll try to get through them as
3918580	3927840	quickly as possible if you to me for being so out of it that I made an error
3927840	3937960	in the email I won't elaborate more also if you to my body because I got really
3937960	3943920	sick on Thursday night well technically Friday morning with some pretty nasty
3943920	3947920	pain in my stomach I mean really bad and I'm not gonna go into details because it
3947920	3955480	was fairly disgusting but I ended up going into the doctor on Friday and
3955480	3962320	tested for a heptic ulcer and a few other stomach related problems and got
3962320	3967920	put on quite a number of drugs to help with digestive issues so and one of them
3967920	3974760	is addictive fun yeah I know I have to be very careful but and then I'm also
3974760	3979600	being treated for a sinus infection because we've had smoke all right pretty
3979600	3984120	bad awful smoke from the fire was it up in Placer County the fires are like all
3984120	3988160	over its surrounding fire there's fires up in the mountains Torino there's fires
3988160	3991560	up in the mountains to the bay there's fires up north and Chico I think there's
3991560	3994980	there's no fires in south and it's the only safe place head south we haven't
3994980	4002760	had any blue skies in a while we've had sort of a dusty brown color true story
4002760	4007200	if you go on to the Wii forecast channel at least yesterday it actually said haze
4007200	4012040	and it showed that disgusting brown colored cloud for our weather and that's
4012040	4016080	the first time I'd ever seen that in this area it was just nasty but the
4016080	4020080	thing is is that basically we've all been you know inhaling you know very
4020080	4025920	fine soot you know in our air and I'm not the only one a lot of people have
4025920	4030080	developed sinus infections just from the damage you know caused from inhaling
4030080	4038080	this day in and day out so if you do the fires even though I normally like fire
4038080	4043240	if you two fires on that scale Wow frisbee inactivated or active activated
4043240	4046400	in our Justin TV chat the weather function because you can type weather
4046400	4050840	and where we're at and the official weather on Justin TV says it's currently
4050840	4057320	83 degrees Fahrenheit conditions smoke yeah that's and today's actually a lot
4057320	4062640	prettier than it has been yes it today is a lot nicer but on top of that though
4062640	4068560	we've had some we've had cooler weather because of the phase however though at
4068560	4073520	the hottest part of the day it has trapped plenty of so and our hottest
4073520	4077360	part of the day is like was it three four o'clock about four yeah right when
4077360	4083400	the show starts about five so it's been on the not fun level and people have
4083400	4087760	been getting sick from it so big f you goes to the the fires and good luck to
4087760	4092360	the people who actually live in those areas yeah definitely I used to live up
4092360	4095040	in Chico where a lot of those fires are happening in that area and I know
4095040	4098920	friends of friends that have been affected and it just sucks there's no
4098920	4103800	there's no real other way to put it sucks I remember going to Julian which
4103800	4108520	is right outside San Diego up in the mountains after they had the big bad you
4108520	4112440	know but forest fires they are the mountains and seeing what happened to

4222280	4225760	flight deck because they lost all the licensing but I would like to point out
4225760	4229680	the survivor ride is still cool and I rode in vertigo for the first time and
4229680	4232120	you know why they call that right in vertigo because it hurts your stomach
4232120	4236400	by the time you're off of it I thought I was gonna hurl you have to go yeah then
4236400	4240880	I thought I was gonna like people but my pants but I got to write the demon like
4240880	4244960	three times in a row because there was no lines on Thursday was awesome the
4244960	4248440	demon is like the best ride ever next to next to top gun flight deck what the
4248440	4252200	fuck ever it's called and then the other if you would go to the fires here which

4331760	4339640	really it well next email dun dun dun hey olr been listening for two years now
4339640	4344720	big fan listening to episode 284 part a y'all are talking about Gradius five I
4344720	4350040	got a suggestion for an old updated shooter 19xx insert subtitle here put
4350040	4355280	out by Capcom its sequel to 1942 and 1943 and this time with weapon powerups
4355280	4359040	akin to what you'd see in space shooters and then addressed to me a classic game
4359040	4364720	of the week it's from Richard and I love the 19xx series and I would love to see
4364720	4369400	an updated one seriously that would be so sweet am I crazy I thought I saw one
4369400	4375720	was in planning I don't have a remake of 1942 coming out to Xbox Live Arcade I
4375720	4378840	thought I had heard something about one of the 19 something-something games
4378840	4383480	being remade or something was happening so you might get your wish sooner sooner
4383480	4389400	than you thought and next step and this comes from I'm just going to say from
4389400	4395040	Peter would a takeover by EA of take to be good for the gaming industry
4395040	4400160	consider 2k sports and the GTA franchise a lot is at stake I personally prefer a
4400160	4408120	takeover then for EA to spin off rockstar I like this you know even though
4408120	4411240	I'm not much of a sports game player I don't think it's a good idea to have 2k
4411240	4415720	sports in EA your two biggest sports game makers in the same roof I just
4415720	4419960	think that's kind of a bad idea that monopolize the market yeah you know as
4419960	4422800	far as the rest of it goes you know I don't know enough about the inner
4422800	4427120	workings of the game industry and how you know how much freedom the current
4427120	4430200	teams would have to continue to develop their products if this happened but that
4430200	4433560	would be my number one concern would be the monopoly of the sports games and
4433560	4436640	that there's really no one else who is wanting to step up and challenge that
4436640	4440440	monopoly of course the fact that EA holds that whole exclusive license thing
4440440	4448880	doesn't help and next up and this comes from Ben I um I cannot believe that you
4448880	4453880	guys didn't jump on this show to 84 6 year anniversary show at 1 hour 7
4453880	4460600	minutes and 40 second mark guitar hero tool comic freakin gold no one jumped on

4471240	4474560	was Andrew that said it I thought was someone in chat that had said it but
4474560	4479240	okay I just said tool would be cool but but I think the joke there is that

4509320	4514120	good weekend Oh Lord smash brothers out is out in the UK why has it taken so
4514120	4518040	long to come out here we always get screwed over with releases what the fuck
4518040	4521400	Nintendo seriously you need to pull your thumb out of your arse and get some
4521400	4525280	decent games out soon I recently completed Metroid on the Wii and I do
4525280	4529520	believe it was a superb game however I can't help but think that there were
4529520	4534160	some areas that could have been improved so easily it could have been incredible
4534160	4538440	the story and writing could have been more immersive and compelling let's face
4538440	4541920	it you didn't really care about why you were shooting at this spiky space a
4541920	4545680	space pirates you just wanted to get to the next pretty stage with a new and
4545680	4552680	bigger gun the cutscenes in this and the sorry the cutscenes in this day and age
4552680	4556680	were pretty poor don't tell me it's because the Wii is underpowered the ps2
4556680	4560320	could pull off cinematic and exciting cutscenes for God's sake take a look at
4560320	4567640	eternal darkness retro one last thing I love being in Samus' ship it was so I'm
4567640	4571280	getting tongue-tied again it was so cool pressing all of those buttons now did I
4571280	4575580	miss something or does the best button do nothing at all you know which one I
4575580	4579880	mean the one that makes the big gun appear it could have been a fantastic
4579880	4583880	bonus to fly off into space and shoot baddies from this fresh perspective okay
4583880	4587920	bitching over you don't have to read this out as I know you hate long emails
4587920	4592300	and I don't hate long emails and may have nominated myself for an FQ of the
4592300	4595760	week oh shit I just realized that I'm making it longer oh should I did it
4595760	4600320	again oh fuck a ball shit fuck ours you're just trying to get me to say that
4600320	4605000	that was funny it worked see you later this email brought to you by chart and
4605000	4608680	is never-ending wait for some kind of goddamn RTS command and conquer game for
4608680	4619280	the Wii nice that was funny email quite next up done done done hi everyone hi
4619280	4628720	hi um I have a few questions for the three of you one no 42 all right go
4628720	4635000	ahead the answer is 42 go ahead have you ever had what could be termed as a holy
4635000	4639080	crap moments as they relate to gaming an example may be like when you seen your
4639080	4643700	first video game or arcade as a youngster or maybe he's youngster that's
4643700	4648520	cute or maybe seen a game that was light years ahead of its contemporaries in
4648520	4652760	some regards Final Fantasy 7 anyone furthermore how heavily do these holy
4652760	4657480	crap moments factor into your decision to stay with gaming if you want a recent
4657480	4662000	example play Lost Odyssey and the first time one of those text-only stories
4662000	4666040	comes up on the screen the memories that was kind of one of those holy crap type
4666040	4669720	moments and I think it was exactly like the way I said it too so there you have
4669720	4673240	it as far as what was the second half of the question how does it play in the
4673240	4679100	year and your decision to stick with gaming um you know just like I like to
4679100	4682440	say holy crap at movies but sometimes I like to laugh at movies sometimes I like
4682440	4685800	to cry at movies not that I really cry at video games but you know I just I
4685800	4689160	like to have fun so it doesn't necessarily have to be a holy crap
4689160	4695940	moment but they help I think that my last holy crap moment I remember when my
4695940	4701440	early holy crap moments was when you're doing the the train cart ride in a Final
4701440	4706880	Fantasy 6 and I was like oh my god it's like Indiana Jones I've got a headache
4706880	4712220	nice but you know I every so often I run into a game that gives me those happy
4712220	4718440	moments like that so I think I keep playing to you know find more of those
4718440	4721520	happy times I thought of one other one how about symphony of the night when you
4721520	4725320	get the real ending quote-unquote and then you go into the upside-down castle
4725320	4728200	and you realize you have to play the whole fucking game all over again it's
4728200	4732000	hard with a whole new oh yeah I was kind of one of those oh my god or how long it
4732000	4737480	took me to freaking get a jewel sword that sucked no I'll tell you what what
4737480	4741680	took even longer was getting the freaking Yotatsuna having to fight the
4741680	4747000	the werewolf that was a pain in the butt anyway and number two a few episodes
4747000	4750200	back Rob mentioned that he was interested in the HD remake of commando
4750200	4754280	3 for the 360 I'm interested in his opinion on it assuming that he's played
4754280	4762000	it I haven't sorry it's on my to-do list naughty me well number three then have
4762000	4766340	the three of you considered making up some goofy as all hell sounding catch
4766340	4770520	phrases or words to use on air I found that using such things can be quite fun
4770520	4774660	my personal favorite is snot puppy don't ask I don't know what it means either I
4774660	4778040	made it up a few years ago after having way too much crown royal and lab at blue
4778040	4784640	I like twat waffle myself but I I didn't I didn't make that up so I can't really
4784640	4789900	claim that I I made that up but I like twat waffle but you know what those
4789900	4794440	types of things you can't force like you can't make fetch happen stop trying to
4794440	4799000	make fetch happen those types of things have to have to happen naturally next
4799000	4803880	you twat waffle for do you know of any places where I can buy video game
4803880	4808080	soundtracks preferably on CD and of sites where I can get them with less
4808080	4812480	than honest you know give them less than honestly but I want to support video
4812480	4815560	game music with my hard-earned money Kinokuniya
4815560	4821200	import Japan import soundtracks play Asia carries a lot of fun yeah Amazon it
4821200	4825720	has a lot of that stuff they've got everything and actually they're really
4825720	4829160	seeing legitimate ones in the u.s. plenty of times now if you don't prefer
4829160	4832160	shopping online you like to walk into a store and look at the real thing try
4832160	4836720	like comic book stores locally because I know one of the ones here has them so it
4836720	4840520	depends where this guy lives try like comic book stores and other nerdy type
4840520	4843200	stores you never know that it might be a small selection but they'll probably
4843200	4847680	have it like the local comic book store here has the Final Fantasies the DDR so
4847680	4855800	you know the big stuff so all right um last question I'm on a similar note once
4855800	4859840	I move I'll be considering buying one two two three arcade machines I've never
4859840	4864160	uh-huh never bought any before in my life with that being said what advice
4864160	4867380	those pointers can you give me if it helps at all all the games I'll
4867380	4872280	considered were made between 1978 1998 and spin across virtually every genre
4872280	4874640	I'll tell you probably the best thing you're gonna be able to do for your
4874640	4881040	money is to get an ego AVS machine get a multi-cart one you can either get them
4881040	4886920	in you can get them in one two four or six sixes are hard to find but fours are
4886920	4891240	still kind of easy and the the cartridges are not that expensive and
4891240	4896360	then on top of that you can just buy new AVS cartridges and switch them out so
4896360	4900880	once in a while you see those ultra Kate ish things pop up like I remember
4900880	4904760	Target was running around one like two Christmases ago and I think Costco once
4904760	4907640	in a while has one too you have to really keep your eye out for them they
4907640	4910560	usually show up around the holidays but you know another multi-game in one
4910560	4914440	system and very very classic stuff you know we built a main cabinet out of a
4914440	4920600	pole position stand up nice so you could do that too maim is fun sorry for the
4920600	4923400	summit lengthy email and thank you for taking the time to read it as well as
4923400	4928060	answer my questions you're welcome that'll be a dollar last email all right
4928060	4932160	this is the long one oh my gosh I thought that was long all right all
4932160	4939160	right last one hello and good show to everyone this is it's Rini right I think
4939160	4944120	so yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay a very long time since I've written in to
4944120	4947160	begin I'd like to touch on knuckles chaotic says featured on dark sacros
4947160	4950640	classic game of the week from a couple episodes ago a correction the games were
4950640	4954040	not the characters were not rendered in 3d they were sprite based what was in
4954040	4958200	3d were the special stages I'm sorry they looked rendered an interesting note
4958200	4962680	on said special stages you can complete them all to get an obligatory set of
4962680	4966080	jewels that need to be acquired however as an extra challenge players could
4966080	4970280	compete in special stages again only this time the stages were drawn in wire
4970280	4974640	frames to make it even more devious the wire frame versions you only had
4974640	4979080	flickering verticals of the polygons to go by to avoid the holes as best as
4979080	4983280	possible a dark soccer also touched on sonic crackers the presumed prototype
4983280	4988600	for chaotic not necessarily a tip but for anyone who's played the old side
4988600	4992400	schooling sonic games should go online and read up on the analyses for earlier
4992400	4996360	ROM dumps that were meant for developers eyes interesting bits include tiny
4996360	5001240	nuances such as the pixel perfect placement of the score ring and life
5001240	5004880	indicators on screen to the creepy sounding genocide city zone an
5004880	5008040	alternative stage that was supposed to be a meltdown version of the chemical
5008040	5011840	plant zone and sonic to the players would reach later in the game it's a
5011840	5015920	nice way to kill an afternoon I love prototypes though I love looking for
5015920	5021920	prototype games I actually have a couple of prototypes that were released for
5021920	5029400	Atari 5200 like millipede hot I know it is hot and this pac-man for the other
5029400	5033160	half of this email that's not quite half it's more like a third I listened to
5033160	5036080	your anniversary shows ask orange knowledge radio segment and Bobby black
5036080	5040920	wolf asked how Konami could improve the American Bemani situation very briefly
5040920	5046440	was pop and music mentioned as to how it could be brought over which should this
5046440	5050240	is the obvious issue of localizing it but there's another problem content
5050240	5054200	correct me if I'm wrong but poppin has a lot of songs unfit for the u.s. I was
5054200	5057240	mulling over this for a while and thought of a different a different way
5057240	5060880	to approach this issue since poppin is not the typical instrument oriented game
5060880	5064780	why make it themed in a certain manner like it is in Japan since the Japanese
5064780	5068320	song list has songs relevant to Japan and its culture why not do something
5068320	5073080	different for the u.s. agreed absolutely agree they don't have to just copy the
5073080	5077320	same damn game agree if you want my take on this Konami should have a video game
5077320	5083080	theme song list an optimal situation the u.s. song list would consist of part chaos
5083080	5087160	part licenses and part songs from video games not just Konami either here's why
5087160	5092760	in my personal preference we should get a poppin we and take Smash Brothers brawl
5092760	5098560	approach because the Wii is selling downloads etc and imagine Konami being
5098560	5103080	able not only to access music from every Nintendo console release but also from
5103080	5107880	any console services on the virtual console aka anything before ps1 and any
5107880	5111520	sort of relevance although technically you can have access to an entirety of
5111520	5116800	Sega's offerings to imagine playing the the goddamn hardcore remix of gourmet
5116800	5123240	race from Kirby superstars that's on brawl on poppin it says holy shit shut
5123240	5129000	up sexy ferret OMG I'm seriously imagine Konami having access to those vast
5129000	5133000	assets and putting select songs in the pop and earlier in their original chip
5133000	5137680	tune form or gloriously remixed from modernization they hadn't on a mail
5137680	5141200	version though can I jump in here and say my suggestion here I think he's on
5141200	5146600	a good track here because I don't think you can make an entire game out of video
5146600	5150720	game nostalgia though and expect it to be totally successful I think a little
5150720	5154160	of that is good and a little bit of the Japanese stuff would be good as well to
5154160	5157600	throw a bone to the old poppin fans but here's the way you want to make pop and
5157600	5161360	music successful here it is I'll give you a big hint it's in the name of the
5161360	5170400	game pop in music pop music what we have guitar hero rock music we have DDR dance
5170400	5174480	music but we don't have anything that's a lot of like poppy music I'm not
5174480	5177640	talking about necessarily Britney Spears and all that although that might be you
5177640	5182560	know inevitable but what about stuff that's like you know 80s pop and 90s pop
5182560	5186600	like could you imagine a game made of all like pop music tunes from the 90s
5186600	5191560	you play on this I think that's where I think this series should go but I think
5191560	5194640	there should be some of the retro video game I just think contract wise and all
5194640	5199200	that stuff probably couldn't happen maybe a little bit the last third of the
5199200	5203920	email oh is it truly wishful thinking but I strongly believe in this approach
5203920	5207720	because if you think about it this would be practically resembling a tribute or
5207720	5211600	acknowledgement of sorts to video games themselves and there aren't really many
5211600	5216080	games if at all that do this oh and it'd be double as filler for Japanese
5216080	5219760	releases but no one cares for that this email has run too long so I'd like to
5219760	5222920	give a chance for another listener to give their input before I finish I would
5222920	5228760	like to chastise the olr host minkletov and the andrew junami that zephyr is
5228760	5232320	that how it's pronounced yes ever for the listless selections for the best
5232320	5235880	man money songs on the sixth anniversary show how could you neglect scorpion fire
5235880	5240640	from 2dx read and I'm talking about the epic eight minute long version one two
5240640	5245880	you're you're all mean but points to look you for canceling out Zephyr this
5245880	5249280	message is brought to you by the metallic rose DS light because baiting
5249280	5252920	and switching target for your coral pink light with four metallic rose just feels
5252920	5260080	right yes I really did do this shame on you but that's funny I was done email
5260080	5264360	epic email is very epic all right let's get back to the news we still got it we
5264360	5271000	still got Tommy and please now let's get let's get to it awesome so there are
5271000	5278320	some interesting patents filed by Sony here in fact people are speculating it's
5278320	5283520	for the next PSP or whatever system they're going to be calling it anyways
5283520	5290640	the grant was or the patent was granted for a handheld device with touchscreen
5290640	5298360	and digital tactile pixels so it's kind of interesting and I have no idea what
5298360	5305960	they claim a digital tactile pixels are it says as for a digital tactile pixels
5305960	5311000	claims 19 through 30 of the patent suggests that a vibration acts as a
5311000	5317560	tactile response so what a PSP with a touchscreen so well like you touch it
5317560	5323080	and it would vibrate or something interesting tickling game hey might be
5323080	5329840	fun well who knows what that's gonna be but something in the works which is not
5329840	5340120	surprising very interesting apparently and I'm apologize because this link here
5340120	5343960	in our role is broken hopefully maybe look you can help me out a little bit
5343960	5347480	here Kingdom Hearts 3 apparently was rumored to be in the next Nintendo power
5347480	5352640	what is up with that well we already talked about that actually in March 3
5352640	5356040	we talked about some of the other stuff that Nintendo Power League but
5356040	5358760	apparently they're saying something about Kingdom Hearts 3 no it was a thing
5358760	5363160	that was rumored there was a sword in the new member Jamie talked about it
5363160	5368200	actually oh really yeah oh so I don't know happen there but basically there's
5368200	5374400	a sword little image thing of a sword and people are saying because it said
5374400	5378320	that if you read the quote on there it said they're teasing what it was there
5378320	5384360	oh it's news fit for a king has a lot of heart it's probably mother 3 just
5384360	5391960	kidding hmm you know King heart 3 I get it oh I see because that happens in the
5391960	5396760	comments to this little news story here well who knows but I don't think I know
5396760	5399600	they've already got two Kingdom Hearts games in the pipeline that aren't even
5399600	5405280	out yet so and you're full of crap that's it I'm full of crap no not you
5405280	5410720	people who are trying to say Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out on the Wii I
5410720	5416560	totally doubt that well we'll see you next month yeah it's true there is some
5416560	5424240	news regarding a crave and the ESA as in crave said a bye to the ESA which is the
5424240	5429280	Entertainment Software Association they actually send a report into they
5429280	5433560	actually confirmed sorry a report on game politics that crave entertainment
5433560	5438520	was basically splitting that they had decided not to renew their membership
5438520	5443440	and they're off to I guess do their own thing you know the other departures that
5443440	5450640	left were the Vendee Activision LucasArts a bunch of other things you're
5450640	5454020	talking about previously but the you know interesting that one more is now
5454020	5458800	join them but then again I try to think what is crave done lately nothing I can
5458800	5466800	think of World Championship poker yippee yeah so I guess this isn't exactly it's
5466800	5470080	not nearly as big as Activision Vendee not going but it is interesting that the
5470080	5478480	Exodus continues nonetheless yeah well one thing that's been gone for a while
5478480	5485160	that's actually just come back is Nestor yes Nestor from Nintendo Power you
5485160	5491360	remember Nestor and Howard or Howard Nestor I guess and their exploits and
5491360	5496560	you know chronicled in Nintendo Power well now after a you know hiatus of
5496560	5504720	quite a long time he's back and grown up and it's interesting because now he's I
5504720	5510760	don't know losing that Mario Kart apparently from the picture too bad
5510760	5513920	Howard won't come back but I hear he works somewhere else now so I don't
5513920	5518160	think that's possible but interesting that those retro comics are making a
5518160	5523040	comeback speaking of retro we're about to the end of part a here and this is
5523040	5525920	the part of the show where we like to pay respect to our elders and this is
5525920	5529160	where dark soccer is gonna go through her gaming closet and dust some things
5529160	5534720	off and come up with a classic video game of the week for you all it's our
5534720	5539440	classic video game of the week what should the kids be playing this week
5539440	5544840	dark soccer the game you know I'm I told everyone I'm gonna give everybody a hard
5544840	5549120	time because they kept bragging on me for Saturn games and for Sega love so I
5549120	5558600	picked a Sega Saturn game awesome I picked a stall which is known as it is
5558600	5567480	awesome I know it's um kisui showed and said to us that is the game of the
5567480	5572320	Japanese shit is what it is it's a 2d side scroller and listen to this music
5572320	5575000	isn't pretty
5581280	5589680	this is one of those gorgeous fairly early in the Saturn's life and it's I
5589680	5594280	mean it really is just a beautiful game that really shows just the amazing 2d
5594280	5598800	capabilities of the Saturn had is the place I'm sorry the PlayStation would
5598800	5603720	not have been able to make this game look this gorgeous I'm sorry it had the
5603720	5610560	2d capability of a snotty nose or something I don't know but it had all of
5610560	5616900	these just beautiful massive levels and you just had to go through the levels
5616900	5620020	and you had your boss bites I mean it is a it is a platformer but it had some
5620020	5628840	pretty cool unique elements basically as you go through the game you actually get
5628840	5639120	a little partner that that comes with you called a Lita that you'd be able to
5639120	5643840	basically send your little friend around like a pinball across the screen you
5643840	5647880	know bumping back and forth and smacking stuff and grabbing items and killing
5647880	5652000	enemies and you also can use it in a co-op mode like you had a second player
5652000	5660080	sort of like how you can use tails in a sonic 2 but you could also you know
5660080	5664200	punch things and jump things and you could you know stun your enemies by
5664200	5668640	punching them and you can throw objects and lift humongous things and you also
5668640	5673240	have this sort of super breath attack that you would inhale and then just blow
5673240	5679360	it all out and blow all the enemies away and it's it's just a really really
5679360	5687200	really cool game so all right there you have it also just to just to mention if
5687200	5691200	anyone read the Sonic the Hedgehog comic books that Archie comics did I still
5691200	5697320	shows up a whole bunch in the background if you can find a YouTube of there's a
5697320	5706720	volcano level it's a fucking awesome this is the first level I don't see it
5706720	5710760	on here but I just have to dig up the game sometime and play it well there you
5710760	5715320	have it folks your classic game of the week a stall on the Sega Saturn pretty
5715320	5719600	little platformer there with epic music a lot of folks in Chad had never heard
5719600	5721600	of that a lot of people are asking what's this game what's this game
5721600	5726500	there's a there's actually another a couple of neat trivia things about it
5726500	5732080	sure go ahead the US release of the game has that where the the title does not
5732080	5738260	appear on the side of the case all you get is the Sega Saturn logo and it also
5738260	5745040	has music hidden in the game which is basically the music from the intro where
5745040	5749040	you can just put a CD player and listen to it it has lyrics in the Japanese
5749040	5753380	version it's just instrumental in the u.s. one and there's also in the games
5753380	5763000	graphic files is a sprite of Mario so there's your trivia all right cool so
5763000	5766700	check that out on the Sega Saturn is a pretty easy game to find or kind of hard
5766700	5771960	at this point hard at this point but if you can find it definitely go for it I
5771960	5775920	know there are images of it available all right we're finally gonna take a
5775920	5778920	break here we're pretty long this segment here over an hour and a half so
