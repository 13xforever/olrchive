13936	25844	Tonight, June 29th, 2008, is the latest game in a popular series going 8-bit, Diablo 3 is finally announced, and we talk on air to Tommy Tallarico from Video Games Live.
31570	35992	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36012	42396	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42496	43937	My name is Rob Roberts.
43997	49700	You might know me as Sky if you talk to us online in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
50160	60946	But also joining us tonight, as always, the one, the only, the lovely, happiest bunny on the farm, one and only, truly, spectacular... Get on with it!
61755	63396	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
63736	66597	He's just trying to butter me up for something.
67397	68017	Can I have a dollar?
69578	71118	No, because I don't have a dollar.
71138	71998	You don't have a dollar.
72038	72679	No, I'm just kidding.
72699	73019	I don't know.
73219	75640	You can have some of my Diet Cherry Pepsi.
75880	77180	I'm in a festive mood tonight.
77220	77720	I don't know why.
77740	78421	You've been busy.
78541	79121	A busy boy.
79221	80641	I have been a very busy boy.
80681	82242	I was out of town most of the weekend.
82262	84803	I was marching in a big parade this morning, which was fun.
84823	85603	I know what would make you cry.
85643	86343	What would make me cry?
86363	88204	You'll find out during what I've played this week.
88684	90706	Okay, well we'll get to that in just a sec.
90946	97071	But I wouldn't be able to get to How Was Your Gaming Week if I wasn't able to introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
97331	97531	Hi.
97791	98131	How are you?
98612	98972	I'm fine.
98992	103396	I'm trying to figure out something that I was talking about before we started the show.
103696	105297	Because I can't remember the damn name of the game.
106118	106778	And it's bugging me.
106898	108419	What was it that we were talking about before the show?
108560	109781	We talk about a lot of things before the show.
109801	111902	I was saying that song should be in a side-scrolling game.
111942	113443	I'm like, like the new Konami one.
114464	115765	I don't remember the name of the game though, but...
117250	117830	Thanks for watching!
134663	136544	We played a track by Akira Yamaoka.
136585	139446	You know him from the dude that does all the music of Silent Hill.
139787	144110	He also contributes to one of our favorite gaming series ever, Beatmania 2DX.
144390	146972	And that particular track was from Beatmania Gold.
147072	149093	Playback Hate You was the name of that song.
149673	153776	And Loki was saying it's a pretty awesome song that should be in another game he was thinking of.
154316	154817	There you have it.
155357	158279	Alright, well speaking of games, we've got a lot of gaming news tonight.
158579	159900	We've got an interview tonight.
159960	161061	Tommy Tallarico is here.
161081	167465	He's going to be joining us during Part B. But first, we've got to start the show as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week.
167525	168926	DarkSakura, what did you play this week?
169507	177992	I downloaded the, when we were at Weeby Toys, aka Toys R Us, I downloaded the Iron Man DS game demo.
178773	181775	And it kind of sucked, but the controls were really cool.
182813	185074	I mean, the controls are kind of complicated, but they were pretty cool.
185194	187354	Okay, so what are the controls, kind of?
187514	188715	Can you describe it?
188775	195037	Well, you've got your... It actually moves up, left, down, right, you know, just like any regular game doesn't do, like, flight commands.
195597	199918	But when you shoot, you touch the touch screen on your little radar pad, and it controls the direction you shoot.
200278	205480	So you can actually move your thumb all around and have them circle around and shoot like that and still move in different directions.
205860	206960	So that part was cool.
207320	210801	And you pick up bombs and lock on, but it was fairly difficult from the get-go.
211001	212102	And honestly...
212882	217164	That type of game needs a bigger screen, so that didn't quite fly.
217224	218885	Okay, here's the game I was talking about.
218905	225469	It's Otomedius, which is a shooter game with cleavage-heavy characters.
225589	229391	It's kind of a Gradius spinoff, and it's in arcades in Japan right now.
229931	232532	It's supposed to be coming to the Xbox 360 on September 25th in Japan.
234406	235167	Alright, there you go.
235247	236348	So, in high def on the 360.
237308	244274	Now, comment from our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com SSJ100Matt, going back to Iron Man, says, And I thought Jamie was anti-Tony Stark.
245816	249819	Only the... Well, okay, I like the character.
249999	254623	I hate what a big dick he's been in the whole, you know, regular Marvel continuity.
255183	257365	But I like the character, and the movie was pretty cool.
258967	260648	So, the game, not nearly as cool as the movie.
261209	262811	Imagine Babies
276089	278371	That's Miklatov's peering through the door.
278391	281674	He's going back to Kansas, so he's waving goodbye forever.
282935	283175	Sorry.
283195	284096	Live radio.
284116	284837	But it sucked.
285017	287499	I didn't want to wave the rattle at the stupid baby.
288240	291202	How does Imagine Babies work?
291242	295586	I picture it like Nintendogs, the way you describe it, like instead of shaking the head.
295666	297448	This is a stupid game.
297468	298729	It's for little children.
298949	302252	It's kind of cute, but I'm like, I don't want any real children.
302272	302952	Why do I want fake children?
302972	303012	So...
321653	325455	because fake children you can do stuff to and CPS won't get called.
327536	328877	They don't let you do crap to them in the game.
328897	330278	You can't pick them up and throw them out the window.
330858	331539	Exactly.
331839	336582	You can't dangle them out the window all Michael Jackson style in real life because that's wrong.
336662	338383	But in a video game, you can do anything.
340024	342225	At any rate, it sucked ass.
342745	348949	And we moved to a new Ragnarok server because our old one has sort of gone to shit.
351479	352120	Well, that sucks.
352140	354102	I'm playing on Void RO now.
354722	355363	They're pretty cool.
355823	356804	A lot cooler, actually.
357505	358506	Very cool people run it.
359667	359888	So.
361810	362530	I'm done.
363531	363872	Alright.
364072	364993	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
365153	366474	Are you sure you're done?
367015	370899	I also laughed my ass off watching Dan play GTA 4.
372000	372621	It was pretty funny.
372641	373742	What was so funny that happened?
374557	377519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
401353	408602	FearTheClaw in chat.orangelandtrader.com says, if Imagine Babies is like Nintendogs, does that mean you can pet them to make them happy?
408942	409623	That would be creepy.
410168	411689	You can wave a rattle at them.
412810	416513	The first thing it has you do is it shows you the baby.
416793	420676	And there's this dark background with a patch of light.
420756	423918	And you have to wave the rattle in that patch of light as it moves around.
423998	428161	And the closer you stay in the middle of it, the happier the baby gets or some shit.
428482	429762	Don't go towards the light!
430483	431043	Run away, Carol Ann!
431063	432585	I won't get paid if you die!
434246	435547	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
436797	437337	It was alright.
437477	441118	I didn't get to play as much because I've been working on web pages.
441598	447100	Anyways, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto 4, as usual.
449020	450901	Still fascinated by the stupid swing set.
451361	452801	That's what we do during lunch now.
453221	460203	That and fire rockets at each other with friendly fire turned off so that we just fly into the air and just take damage from the impact.
461624	463064	I don't know, we're easily amused.
463565	474127	And then I also played over here actually the other day because I got Rob a copy for his birthday and it's odd that I'm playing his copy of the game before I played mine which I bought weeks ago.
475127	480129	But Blastworks and we actually played that a bit and that was funny because people were amused by it.
480149	483069	They were like, look at your ship, it's like taking up the whole screen.
484210	484830	It was pretty cool.
485390	486490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
515387	515667	I do.
517829	519650	And then, I'm trying to think if I played anything else.
520011	521392	I don't think I did.
521512	525975	Actually, I checked out that... I don't remember what it's called now.
526075	527096	It's like some cooking guide.
527136	528397	Can't decide what to eat or whatever.
529558	529979	It's alright.
530319	532500	It's kind of a neat concept.
532781	535123	Not really a game, but just a recipe book.
535203	538885	It teaches you how to do different techniques and stuff.
538906	540847	And there's a lot of video and stuff in there.
541307	543809	And plus, you can make your own shopping lists and stuff like that.
543949	544090	So...
545273	545694	It's neat.
546354	546675	I don't know.
548317	549578	The recipes were kind of limited.
549618	550739	I wish you could add your own.
552862	555325	But, I don't know.
555465	556125	It's a neat idea.
557527	558909	Something that needs to be done over here, I think.
559810	561832	Although there was that Gourmet Chef game that came out over here.
561852	562733	I don't know what that is, though.
563888	566071	Lots of cooking games getting popular over here.
580199	580800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
595279	620175	which kind of sucks if it's similar to that it should be just like kind of American Idol what American Idol is a karaoke revolution you know where they berate you for sucking that's what should be like Cookie Mama but instead of Mama Will Fix It it's you're fucking lame you suck take this game back to the store because you suck I'm coming to your house and killing you and your family get out of my face fuck off
621138	622058	That's how the show is.
642201	648185	It is a very hard shooter at first, but once you get the hang of it, there's a certain delicate balance to it.
648685	651506	You've probably heard this game by now is based on Tamiki Fighters.
651667	655529	Imagine Katamari Damacy meets a shooter game.
655869	659491	As you destroy ships, you can run over them and attach them to your ship.
659951	662092	As you can imagine, the ship gets quite huge.
662132	664934	The trick is having to balance using the collapse button.
665214	665794	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
691095	701000	I was feeling a little bit retro this week, and it'll probably be explained why when we get into the news a little later, but I decided to go pick up an old GameCube game, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.
701340	708644	I wanted to pick up because I was suddenly getting a hankering for playing Mega Man again, and I'm sure as we get into tonight's news, you'll understand why if you haven't already heard.
709624	716728	Now, I know there's a lot of people that talk smack about the GameCube version of Mega Man Anniversary Collection because the buttons are switched, and you can't
717448	719770	You can't turn them around very easily.
720611	721692	But look, let me put it this way.
721792	722833	It cost me six bucks.
723534	725055	So it's hard to complain with that.
725235	726476	And I'm having fun.
726557	728578	It's the old Mega Man games all over again.
728899	735665	I was playing a little bit of Mega Man 8 because the anime scenes in Mega Man 8 are so crappy and the voiceovers and stuff.
735785	736806	I laugh every time.
737066	737667	It's awesome.
738067	741010	But I want to go back and play the old school Mega Mans too because, you know...
741570	742130	They're all there.
742150	744991	It's like Mega Man 1 through 8, and then the fighting games you unlock, too.
745011	746451	Yeah, the fighting games are kind of lame.
746571	747591	I got my work cut out for me.
747631	751812	Yeah, I mean, I've played them before on MAME, and I think they're on GameTap?
752152	753372	I think they're on there.
753452	753932	I don't remember.
754732	757293	But I've definitely played them before, and they're okay.
757393	760734	Oh, they're on the... I played them in the arcade, because they're on the Ultracade.
761194	763454	Even though they were never released here, they were on Ultracade.
763994	766295	Like, years ago, I played it on there.
766975	767095	So...
768672	769493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
786232	811703	Allgames.com is currently down from what I understand there was a virus something that hit the server computer I don't know the details because I'm not much of a tech person obviously if you're listening live tonight then you figured out that you can go to allgamesradio.com to listen to us or you probably have the URL of the feed saved in iTunes or what have you so it's made it very easy to listen to the show I'm told allgames.com will be back very soon probably by the time most people are hearing this podcast so no worries there
812984	813444	Thanks for watching!
833491	845819	I'm really horrible at updating Facebook because every time I log into Facebook, I have like 150 different crappy applications that are trying to say, you know, hey, so-and-so thinks you would be compatible and should go on a date.
845859	847840	And then it's like, I already am dating somebody.
847901	850762	Or so-and-so wants you to play Scrabble with them.
850842	852423	Or so-and-so wants you to take this quiz.
852463	854205	And I'm so freaking sick of all that shit.
854505	855525	I don't ever go to Facebook.
855826	856726	But it's there.
856766	857827	We do have a Facebook community.
857947	858507	So there you have it.
858527	859348	Okay.
860768	861168	That's it.
861288	862569	Other things coming soon.
862949	866332	I can't talk about them, but we're working on stuff soon.
866972	867272	I know.
867592	868513	How descriptive, huh?
868553	868933	Things.
869193	870414	I'm trying to build excitement.
871235	871575	Things.
871915	874357	Things are happening at some point.
875396	877317	So, all right.
877597	878738	Penny Arcade Expo.
879238	879779	I'm going.
880299	881059	I know I'm going.
881500	882840	DarkSakura might be going.
883020	883301	Might.
883421	884121	Big might.
884541	886042	Loki, however, will not be going.
886262	886743	Probably not.
886843	887403	Because of the wife.
887983	888183	Yeah.
888424	888724	All right.
890004	891165	I don't know if I could swing that.
891425	891665	All right.
891705	892026	We'll see.
892086	893406	So hopefully we'll have some representation.
893426	895348	I know at least I will be there come hell or high water.
895968	897028	Hopefully two out of three.
897329	900751	Because I had to swing my company's doing a...
901531	902552	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
916644	919325	I wish I could go, but I don't know if I can.
945512	946493	And we'll bring cider for you.
946713	947093	We'll see.
948414	950396	With alcohol and cider for me and the kids.
950496	954278	Anyhow, more details on that as PAX approaches.
955179	956500	Let's get into some gaming news.
957601	961444	Bobby Blackwolf says Scott is actually not going to be there because he's at Burning Man.
961804	962344	Okay, wait a minute.
962364	964666	He's passing up PAX to go run naked in the desert?
965066	965486	Come on.
966007	966287	Lame.
966307	967028	Doesn't that sound fun?
967988	968989	Actually, it does sound kind of fun.
969069	969549	I don't know.
969689	971551	I mean, blowing stuff up is pretty fun.
971651	973792	No, actually, Burning Man does sound kind of cool.
973832	977755	I think that's one of the things I want to do at some point before I die is go to Burning Man at least once.
977855	981658	Even though me plus sun equals not good.
981958	984240	Like, I get all gross and my skin doesn't.
984260	985540	Yeah, it was a redhead.
985560	987222	Let's say redheads don't do well in sun.
988242	989323	He starts to melt.
989563	990564	I understand that.
990724	993186	If I went to Burning Man, I think I could only go for like a day.
994427	994947	So there you go.
995928	996208	All right.
996858	998459	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1026633	1027053	Thanks for watching!
1040246	1040606	Awesome.
1040646	1043327	And they had some screenshots that leaked out there.
1043667	1045128	I think scans from the issue.
1045168	1046348	But it looks cool.
1047028	1047469	Very cool.
1047929	1050330	And the first female boss robot.
1050710	1052371	Yes.
1052411	1055052	They did have a list of the different boss men that you'd be fighting.
1055232	1058453	They have Magma Man, Galaxy Man, Plug Man.
1060654	1062095	What does Plug Man plug?
1062115	1063495	I have a curiosity.
1063595	1067217	Concrete Man and Splash Woman.
1068837	1072998	Alright, Megan Esplash, the first female boss character.
1073038	1082279	Although I think I heard, I don't know, I might be getting mixed up, but I think in Japan one of them was a woman in a prior game and it got somehow switched on the way over here to America.
1082719	1085480	I could be wrong on that, don't quote me on that, but I don't want to say somebody was telling me that.
1085980	1094261	But that's still, what do you guys think about, this is interesting because Mega Man series is essentially taking a step backwards, but in a way it's a step forwards, right?
1094401	1095722	It's awesome, I think it's a great idea.
1096602	1097842	They should do that for more stuff.
1098885	1099825	Well, they kind of are.
1099885	1102687	I mean, look at Bionic Commando Rearmed.
1104508	1110591	It's not exactly as old school as Mega Man as far as the way they're doing it, but same type of thing.
1110631	1113232	It's a 2D game.
1113472	1119555	They kind of forget that a lot of times, even though we do have the technology to do 3D games and stuff, you don't always have to do that.
1120195	1120575	Amen.
1121216	1122016	What do you think, DarkSakura?
1122036	1122856	Are you excited about this?
1123657	1124217	Fairly so.
1125233	1128015	I hear all the music is going to be 8-bit-ish and all that stuff.
1128035	1128795	That's going to be great.
1130356	1130656	I don't know.
1130696	1132578	DJ Dark Knight in our chat room might not agree.
1132838	1134819	Worst Mega Man boss names ever.
1136451	1137251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1156098	1156438	Mega Man 2 and 3
1173397	1176038	were probably the peak of the series, a lot of people would tell you.
1176178	1180119	I'm sure there's some hardcore Mega Man people out there that are like, no, 7 or 5 or whatever.
1180479	1186521	But I think a lot of us fondly, fondly remember 2 and 3, so that's kind of interesting they're going back.
1186761	1190442	But I know I'm going to check it out, because if it's retro, hopefully that means it's cheap.
1191083	1191843	And I like cheap.
1192782	1194283	Thanks for watching!
1214522	1215683	Defender Castle Awesome WiiWare game
1243508	1247310	Shaoran said in chat, says soon we're going to have Pencil Man and Cloth Man.
1247350	1249171	Hey, I don't know, Pencil Man might be kind of funny.
1249892	1251092	Like he shoots erasers at you.
1251112	1256395	Well, it's like, okay, they've got to always have a, you know, a villain that's, you know, fire based.
1256415	1259517	And they're like running out of different words for fire in there.
1259577	1264560	Like Magma Man and, you know, Fire Man, Heat Man, Hot Man.
1265020	1265921	Fuego Man.
1266161	1266901	Fuego Man.
1266921	1267702	Heat Man was cool though.
1268162	1269683	Heat Man was like the coolest of the...
1270120	1271426	Heatman was pretty cool.
1272049	1272632	I'm old school.
1272652	1273376	I like Fireman.
1275017	1276037	But Heatman's only one game later.
1276057	1280219	I say they make a new Mega Man game, just have all of the different bosses in there.
1280539	1281299	Like, all of them.
1281459	1282660	Mega Man boss rush?
1283100	1287542	Yeah, just have, like, well, not necessarily playing all the bosses, but just have all the levels from all the other games, too.
1287562	1290303	That's what the Anniversary Collection should have been.
1290363	1296065	You can use the weapons from Mega Man 8 and Mega Man 1 and, you know, mix it all up.
1296165	1296765	That'd be awesome.
1297586	1301247	And Ossifer makes the mandatory Boobie Man reference.
1301867	1303168	J-Rod says Toaster Man.
1304298	1304659	There you go.
1304759	1306141	J-Rod says Powdered Toast Man.
1306581	1306802	All right.
1307363	1308084	Powdered Toast Man.
1308104	1309065	I was just thinking that.
1309125	1309366	All right.
1309426	1309686	Enough.
1309766	1310027	Enough.
1310207	1313692	I do not want the chat room filling up with Blank Man or whatever there.
1314213	1314493	All right.
1315254	1316476	No, Blank Man was already done.
1317297	1318299	Was there a Blank Man really?
1318319	1319280	Yeah, there was a Blank Man movie.
1320523	1322564	This place is thick with the stench of ghoul.
1338527	1339187	What can I say?
1339247	1342088	It looks like Diablo 2 and Diablo 1, but much prettier.
1342168	1344488	It's obvious that this game has evolved quite a bit.
1345088	1353330	This game, of course, was unveiled at Blizzard's recent event over in France, the Worldwide Invitational, and tons of stuff was leaked.
1353350	1357911	There was a trailer, there's this 20-minute gameplay clip we're looking at here in studio right now.
1358351	1359911	What do you guys think of Diablo 3?
1360251	1363832	I know you guys don't play a whole lot of PC games, but what do you guys think?
1363852	1364492	It looks pretty cool.
1365242	1366102	Yeah, it was pretty cool.
1366162	1367003	I'd have to check it out.
1367183	1369364	I mean, I never played any of the others, but I tried this one.
1370384	1375546	I played a little bit of, I think, Diablo, like back in the day when I had the demo and stuff for it.
1375726	1376387	And it was fun.
1376807	1382489	It was one of those games you could sit there and play for a while and you level up some and then stop and go back to it later.
1382809	1386851	It's kind of like the whole grinding part of World of Warcraft, except you don't actually have any...
1387642	1391385	Well, as far as I'm aware, because I only played the demo, like, huge quests you have to go on.
1391445	1393086	It's just grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.
1393146	1394367	Oh, look, I'm super powerful now.
1394467	1395187	Kill, kill, kill.
1395387	1399650	And you do have quests, but part of the really cool thing about the old Diablos is that everything was randomized.
1399670	1401832	You'd like to start today by introducing the Barbarian.
1401972	1404694	I'm going to turn that off, because now the guy is talking about the Barbarian class.
1406855	1410117	All the dungeons were randomized, so it was like you were playing a new game every time.
1410137	1411538	That was kind of one of the cool things about it.
1412639	1413460	Guild Wars does that.
1414340	1414540	What?
1415921	1416902	Yeah, that's true, huh?
1417921	1418641	So, very cool.
1418681	1419602	But, you know, I don't know.
1419622	1420523	Diablo is just different.
1420543	1425005	Diablo is not really an MMO, but it is something you can experience with tons of other people, which is kind of cool.
1425686	1427787	I do like the four-player co-op that they're going to have in there.
1428027	1428287	Oh, yeah.
1428307	1431649	Because didn't Diablo 2 only go up to two-player co-op, I think?
1431789	1432349	I don't remember.
1433030	1433170	So...
1433570	1434050	There you have it.
1434070	1435771	Diablo 3 officially announced this week.
1435811	1438291	And there's stuff all over the internet on this.
1438331	1441272	If you want the official word, Diablo3.com is where it's at.
1441312	1442493	Just go to any Blizzard site.
1442753	1446714	That whole splash screen that was being teased all week long was there.
1447074	1449475	As far as when this comes out, who knows?
1449495	1451595	Because we still have StarCraft 2 on the list.
1451815	1452896	We still have Wrath of the Lich King.
1452936	1453156	When?
1453456	1453836	Sometime.
1456006	1459148	SSJ100Matt says it'll be on my Hanukkah list for 2011.
1459208	1462051	It's probably not a bad bet.
1462411	1463372	I would say maybe 2010.
1463712	1467335	I think we'll get StarCraft 2 next year and probably Diablo 3 the year after.
1467696	1470898	I think Diablo 3 will probably come out around the same time as StarCraft 2.
1471158	1473540	I think you may have one in the fall, one in the spring.
1474661	1478925	J-Rod says Diablo was cool until people started cheating to make their own loot.
1479226	1482168	Yeah, I hear that's a real problem that plagued Diablo 2 on Battle.net.
1482389	1484751	This is why I don't like to play games except with friends.
1485131	1486953	You know, because I know that friends won't cheat.
1487033	1487954	Or OLR listeners.
1488014	1488454	I don't know.
1488615	1490496	You know, cheating sometimes, it can be fun.
1490516	1492879	Because, like, with Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert...
1493659	1494900	I love that stuff, man.
1495280	1500464	Especially when you found out about the whole rules I and I file and you can make your own units by combining stuff.
1500804	1502465	That made the game even more fun for me.
1502565	1507308	But if you and I agree, okay, we're going to play this game or we're going to cheat the hell out of it and just have fun with it.
1507368	1508049	That's one thing.
1508089	1509950	I mean, that's cool because we're both on the same page.
1510230	1521418	But if I've worked really hard to level this character and then some stranger pops in my room and dumps all this shit in my thing that he's cheated to get or shown off or whatever, that's just dumb.
1521718	1522498	You know what I mean?
1522518	1523179	What are you trying to prove?
1523639	1539569	that's sort of the problem that we had I guess with the last Ragnarok server we were on that people were sort of exploiting a little problem in there duplicating items and things and messing up the economy and as a result all of us suffered for it you know so yeah cheaters suck
1541056	1543957	I think that there's such a thing as appropriate cheating.
1544397	1559500	Yeah, what Matt's talking about, you know, like, you know, what they do at work and everything, when they're, you know, whatever, that's one thing, because you all agree you're going to cheat, and the whole point, you're having fun with the exploits, but, you know, these other a-holes that come on and try to ruin other people's, you know, legit experiences suck.
1559540	1569983	Well, I would say it's less of a cheat, more of a mod, because you're just modifying the game, and in order to play someone, because this was back in the day when I was playing someone Red Alert over, you know, a fucking modem.
1570943	1581649	So, you know, we would share the same file back and forth and then basically play this, you know, kind of hacked version on both computers, which was pretty fun, actually.
1582369	1582929	Especially with...
1584999	1591623	I made the super fast tanks and Einstein that shot lightning and the suicide bombers and stuff like that.
1591843	1592284	That was great.
1593264	1598688	Looking in chat here, Hitstun says, Funny, I play with OLR listeners because they hack just as much as I do.
1599108	1602370	Well, again, if you all agree you're going to hack, then that's one thing.
1603010	1606573	But it's just when you try to kind of cross the line there where you're an ass.
1607973	1609594	If you're trying to ruin other people's experience.
1610895	1612596	But that's... Hey, you know what?
1612616	1616178	Diablo 3 is definitely... You think it's going to break the Diablo 2 record?
1616238	1621922	I want to say, if I remember right, Diablo 2 has the best PC game launch ever.
1622022	1623182	Even above World of Warcraft.
1623563	1625904	Diablo 2 sold like a million copies in its first week.
1626344	1627805	Is Diablo 3 going to top that?
1628265	1630467	Or is PC gaming dead?
1631169	1631590	I don't know.
1631670	1642580	I've read enough fan-gasming on LiveJournal to make me think that if that's just a small portion of the community, I think that it would be big.
1643000	1645202	I think it's definitely going to give Diablo 2 a run for its money.
1645583	1647064	I don't think PC gaming is dead.
1647244	1650427	I think there's enough people... PC gaming is napping.
1652349	1663577	I don't even think it's necessarily... There's certainly a hardcore audience very into PC gaming, but I'll tell you what, love them or hate them, whoever you are in the PC gaming community, Blizzard gets people to the PC.
1664946	1665506	Diablo 3 coming soon.
1682796	1696148	Well, going back to other Blizzard news, there were some people who were afraid that Diablo 3 would steal World of Warcraft players, but Blizzard really isn't worried about that because...
1698522	1706851	Well, the thing is they're actually just not concerned about losing the revenue because if they go from one of their projects to another of their projects, they're still getting money from it.
1709173	1716100	But they said that it's not going to be as big of a crossover between the communities because they're different types of game.
1716160	1720445	But they do hope that plenty of the World of Warcraft players would be interested in Diablo 3.
1722250	1722710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1738197	1739398	No, probably not.
1739498	1745140	I can't because Irene might call me and be all, Rob, Kara, and I'm going to have to drop Diablo 3 to go run Karazhan again.
1746781	1750583	Curtis in chat is addressing the whole issue about PC gaming.
1750983	1757026	He says, I have Portal on my PC because unfortunately I'm still stuck with a PS2 and can't afford next gen.
1757446	1762089	I think there's a lot of people still doing PC gaming because of that, but I've got to be honest.
1762149	1764350	I look at a game like Diablo 3 and I'm going...
1764850	1767692	I'm probably going to have to upgrade my computer in order to be able to play that.
1767792	1768192	I don't know.
1768293	1774837	Blizzard's sometimes pretty good at getting the tech requirements pretty low, but I'm a little worried I'm going to have to upgrade the computer to be able to play that.
1774897	1777980	So if you have to upgrade the computer, isn't that just like, you know, might as well buy a system?
1778820	1780221	It's like buying a few systems.
1780461	1786305	Yeah, but I understand that, you know, some people want to put it all in one, you know, then invest all the money in your best machine.
1786346	1789488	I think that's a big reason why there are a lot of people really into PC gaming.
1789508	1790368	Yeah, kind of the same.
1790689	1793170	It's the same thing, yet opposite for me, because...
1794392	1804055	Because I've upgraded my system, I have to buy more PC games because what's the point in upgrading it that much to play games if you're not going to play games on it?
1806879	1834607	I don't think Blizzard is really going to be losing any WoW players to Diablo I don't think Blizzard will really start losing WoW players until other MMOs come out that really step up to challenge them which Age of Conan is probably done better than most so far and there's others I think Warhammer is going to be coming soon I've heard a lot of buzz about that and eventually WoW 2 or World of Starcraft which in 5 years is probably inevitable so we'll see what they need is like World of Dead or Alive keep on dreamin
1835163	1835943	Itagaki, man.
1836424	1836964	He can do it.
1838625	1848230	One thing that's going to be coming hopefully pretty soon here, and we've been hearing about this for a while now, is the trophy system for the PlayStation 3.
1849010	1853152	Kind of their answer to the achievements that are on Xbox 360.
1853813	1858055	Well, there are some pictures that have leaked out, supposedly, of this trophy system.
1858775	1861177	They show that you're actually not going to have gamer points.
1862150	1862570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1882501	1882901	Thanks for watching!
1898044	1902848	So, basically, it sounds like the achievement system, I don't know, it kind of reminds me of, like, Burnout.
1903309	1905971	You know, where, like, if you get a certain time, you get a gold.
1906031	1909655	If you get a certain, you know, higher time, it's a silver, and so on, for a bronze.
1909895	1911576	They're going to have that type of system.
1911596	1916161	Well, I think what's going to be the difficulty for each trophy, it's not going to be like, you know...
1917894	1922558	I guess, sort of like that, but you wouldn't be able to, like, say, get gold and then get all the trophies below it.
1922618	1928483	It would be just, like, different things, like, finish level one, bronze trophy, finish the game, you know, gold trophy or something like that.
1928503	1928823	Gotcha.
1929343	1932966	Reading some more comments from chat, chat.orangelunchradio.com, live on this Sunday night.
1933507	1937630	J-Rod says, trophies and achievements, god no, I can't juggle that between two systems.
1938050	1938911	Achievement whore!
1939691	1939791	Um...
1940683	1942565	Don't Conan equal World of Dead or Alive?
1958062	1958382	Parts.
1958402	1959563	Parts.
1980112	1985636	You know it's inevitable that God of War 3 is going to come out sometime for the PlayStation 3.
1986436	1988498	But were you guys thinking that it might be this soon?
1988618	1998646	Well, apparently one of the Eurogamer affiliates, Eurogamer.pt, has run a report that God of War 3 is going to be shown at E3 this next month.
1999446	2002989	This was from a Sony rep at the Interactive Digital Entertainment.
2003269	2004990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2020940	2022882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2043437	2061168	I kind of see this, if a trailer is unveiled, which I don't see why it wouldn't be because this is one of Sony's biggest franchises, it's going to be in the vein of the early, early Halo 3 trailers where it's going to show you like, you know, there's going to be some epic music and then, you know, some girl talking like, you know, in a land far away.
2061548	2062188	We need your help.
2062228	2063909	And whatever shit they're going to talk in the thing.
2064269	2068731	And then you'll see suddenly at the very end of the trailer, Kratos' face in HD.
2068831	2071432	And it's going to be like, oh my god, fangasm!
2071732	2072873	And then God of War 3, 2009.
2073273	2074634	And that's going to be it.
2075354	2078355	I mean, it's kind of predictable at this point.
2078715	2083598	Or then again, if it is Sony, they could say it's coming out this Christmas and then just keep pushing it back until it gets to Christmas 2009.
2085248	2086589	It is the Sony way, isn't it?
2087250	2095016	Did you hear about the other rumor that they're saying that Kratos is going to be a hidden character in Soul Calibur 4 on the PlayStation 3?
2095416	2096197	I had heard that.
2096217	2099500	I think it was on the lineup for tonight, but it got cut because we're going to be long otherwise.
2099520	2100580	But yeah, I'd heard about that.
2100620	2101221	Isn't that weird?
2102282	2102962	It'd be interesting.
2102982	2107386	It'd be something that they could probably slip in there for E3 or whatever since the game comes out a few weeks after that.
2107526	2112068	But I would think, if that is true, wouldn't a word of that already slip out somehow?
2112088	2112848	No, not really.
2114108	2119751	They've been announcing stuff each week, like little tidbits, doing different screens.
2120311	2123432	They were talking about the tag system that's supposedly in there now.
2123772	2135276	There's another thing I saw the other day for the character creator, where you can basically create... Someone made a solid snake, or old snake, basically, and Ryu...
2137697	2141320	Ryu from Ninja Gaiden.
2141380	2144082	FearTheClaw in chat says that's three games in three years.
2144163	2145604	It's like Tony Hawk or Madden.
2146324	2151769	And then I'm thinking, wait a minute, there's the PSP one, but J-Rod jumps in and says, yeah, but the PSP one doesn't count for most people.
2152209	2153611	I heard the PSP one was actually pretty good.
2153631	2154471	I didn't play it myself.
2154491	2160837	I'm not really in the God of War, but... I can see them probably will port the PSP one to the PlayStation 2 before the third one comes out.
2161537	2162198	Hmm, we'll see.
2162563	2165325	because they've been doing that quite often.
2165866	2168948	Well, I think it's inevitable God of War 3 at some point.
2168988	2171710	We'll just see if we get a teaser at E3 or not.
2173412	2177875	Well, there is some other news that should probably be pretty exciting.
2177895	2182019	I'm actually kind of excited about this.
2183300	2191566	Nintendo Power put up an image of a photo taken of the Castlevania game for Wii and it looks like a fighting game.
2192827	2211097	and not a platformer but it said so far you should be able to well at least it's rumored that you should be able to play Simon, Alucard, Shanoa, Marie Renard and Dracula it better have Richter in it that's all I'm saying
2211806	2214007	But doesn't it look like a fighting game?
2214147	2214947	It looks like a fighting game.
2214967	2216548	Yeah, it's like Soul Calibur.
2216568	2218928	So is this Konami's response to Soul Calibur?
2219128	2219408	Maybe.
2219949	2224070	GS68 calls it Fightervania and then facepalms in our chatroom.
2225150	2227811	It's Castlevania Judgment, I think was the name of the name.
2229432	2230092	I want to play it.
2230818	2241742	Here's my quandary with this is that this looks like one of those things that could be really, really, really freaking awesome or really, really, really terrible.
2242002	2242622	You know what I mean?
2243343	2251085	And I'm just kind of worried it's going to be terrible, but I'm hopeful because these are some great characters in a great franchise.
2251105	2254887	Simon's got pretty hair and shapely legs.
2258232	2261860	Don't most of the Castlevania characters play kind of similar?
2262100	2264124	What's going to differentiate all these different characters?
2264485	2265507	Richter had different moves.
2266792	2269855	Remember he had the backwards double jump?
2271176	2280464	If you go by Symphony of the Night, he had the double jump, and then the one where he leaps up, and then the backflip that would let you go an extra space and a half.
2281966	2286169	If you put Maria in it, I don't know if she'd have her crybaby attack from when she was a little girl.
2286209	2288351	I did see a screenshot that they had Maria in it.
2289072	2292015	There was a second screenshot that was floating around out there also.
2293462	2300248	You know what would be kind of cool is if certain boss characters were kind of downgraded to, you know, the playable fighters in this.
2300308	2305192	So you could like play as the Grim Reaper or you could play as, I don't know, the Vampire Bat, maybe not.
2305512	2308675	Or Medusa or, you know, some of those like old school Castlevania bosses.
2308695	2309475	That might be kind of fun.
2309616	2310296	Is it just me?
2310636	2313739	I think that would be fun to play as like the Grim Reaper as a character.
2315080	2316922	Well... Or Dracula.
2317682	2320525	I would think that if Dracula is in it, Dracula is in it as a boss.
2321616	2323997	Bosses are always playable once you unlock them, though.
2324298	2325538	I know, I know, I know.
2325578	2326379	They should have Shaft.
2327520	2328840	The Dark Priest Shaft.
2331002	2338086	And their little text exchange should be like, he's like, yeah, we hear you're one bad, and then he says, shut your mouth.
2339087	2344330	I hope that they have horrendous voice acting, like the old school PlayStation Symphony of the Night game.
2344370	2345170	That would rock.
2346931	2351154	I just think that Simon had pretty hair in that one picture.
2351758	2354320	I imagine this is something that we'll get a trailer of at E3.
2354761	2358585	So hopefully we'll get a little more feeling about if this is going to suck or not.
2359325	2365131	Again, I'm hopeful, but it's one of those things where it's like, boy, they could really screw this up if they wanted to.
2365231	2367133	So I hope they took the time to get it right.
2367153	2367553	We'll see.
2367653	2374259	Yeah, and unfortunately I can't see that the track record for spin-off games have been that great, especially on the Wii.
2375060	2376201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2396309	2397510	What was the Tekken game?
2399191	2402473	Oh, God, there was the spinoff with Nina, right?
2402554	2403454	It was Death by Degrees.
2404935	2405596	That was shit.
2406796	2410859	Guilty Gear 2 Overture.
2410879	2415222	It's alright, but it's kind of like 99 Nights a bit.
2416103	2418745	I'm trying to think if there's another one there.
2420883	2426206	DarkTetsuya says, I want to play as Grant from Castlevania 3.
2426887	2428728	He can climb on the freaking walls and ceiling.
2429188	2432390	In the Japanese version, instead of just stabbing with the knife, he actually threw knives.
2433055	2434617	See, this... That would have been a lot better.
2435658	2437379	These are the kind of characters that need to be in the game.
2438140	2445727	You know, and I say, you know, we might be talking negatively about this game already because we're very cautious, but by all means, please, Konami, prove us wrong.
2446388	2448270	Make us eat our words, please.
2448770	2449811	Please feel free.
2449831	2450772	And you know what?
2450812	2455377	The graphics don't look that bad, so if they wanted to do, say, another 2D Castlevania game for the Wii...
2456684	2458025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2475223	2480527	So, basically, today you have Guitar Hero Aerosmith, which I'm sure a lot of people picked up.
2481447	2484049	Other than today, there's really a whole lot of nothing.
2484749	2488192	Elements on PC, which is some puzzle game.
2488812	2492474	Supreme Ruler 2020, also another PC game.
2492755	2493935	That's a strategy title.
2496197	2496777	Let's see...
2498109	2519996	The Immortals of Terra I have no idea what that is Journey to the Center of the Earth for the DS which is based on the new movie that's coming out here they keep trailering like crazy 1 vs 100 the only game with Bob Saget in it it's for the DS until they make a full house game
2520760	2522942	Yes, which will never happen.
2523522	2525063	Rugu on PC.
2525083	2525964	Whoops, sorry about that.
2526024	2527085	I'm looking at a banner ad.
2527145	2528806	God damn these banner ads that make noise.
2528846	2529306	I hate that.
2529987	2531308	Anyways, Rugu on PC.
2531688	2533970	Cool little independent game, so that's worth checking out.
2534670	2535911	PurrPals on the Wii.
2536492	2540415	Yeah, another cat raising sim or cats raising you sim.
2541776	2544438	Gears of War, the refresh as they're calling it.
2544498	2548701	Basically the re-release of Gears of War with some extra content and a new price point of $39.99.
2550382	2550982	That's on the 360.
2552122	2556183	Dekatimoto on the DS, a motorcycle racing game.
2557584	2561485	AMF Bullying Pinbusters, that's on the DS as well.
2562305	2565385	Hail to the Chimp on the PS3.
2566346	2572727	The only game that's actually cool this week, Trauma Center Under the Knife 2, coming out for the DS.
2573887	2576888	And that's it.
2578755	2579115	Wow.
2579936	2580997	Some comments from chat.
2581577	2584800	Kdog96 asks, hasn't 1 vs. 100 been cancelled?
2585821	2585961	No.
2586321	2587482	No, I think the show was.
2587803	2588263	Oh, the show?
2588283	2592366	The TV show was, but if they made the game, I think they're kind of stuck releasing it.
2592707	2594568	Yeah, the game's been pushed back a while now.
2594588	2596490	Some comments on Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
2596550	2599652	DeadmanWalking in chat says, Guitar Hero Aerosmith is awful.
2600213	2605857	Jrod says, Guitar Hero Aerosmith has a great track list, but I can't get myself to support Activision milking that franchise.
2607319	2607679	Excuse me.
2609685	2615007	There's a large part of me that really wants to get Guitar Hero Aerosmith, but I cannot justify $60 on it.
2615167	2615727	I just can't.
2616347	2617868	So I'm hoping it comes down in price soon.
2617908	2618908	You can come play it at my house.
2619688	2621129	Oh, that's right, because Dan's going to get it, huh?
2621169	2621349	Yeah.
2621409	2627691	I mean, it's a good thing that they're releasing music games and stuff like that, but I think more than one release a year is too much.
2627751	2632972	Even with DDR, if they were releasing two or three games a year, that would be overkill, I think.
2632992	2634613	All right, let's head on.
2634633	2635073	D-Extreme Stage
2661080	2662241	Let's check out some of the other systems.
2662261	2664783	I know there's nothing coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
2665263	2672889	On the Wii, Akodepan Ikisama Horoyuki is coming out, and Jawa Mammoth Tohitsumu no Ishii is also coming out.
2672949	2681075	I have no idea what either of those games are, but I imagine Akodepan is probably some type of puzzle game, if I'm not mistaken.
2682276	2683497	Yeah, it looks like... Oh, it's a board game.
2684335	2686237	So, board game translation for the Nintendo Wii.
2686277	2689379	Probably not a game we really play here on this side of the ocean.
2689839	2691280	I'm looking at the handheld system.
2691340	2693002	Actually, quickly looking at PlayStation 2.
2693682	2695244	Some other price reductions there.
2696925	2703670	Also, El Nokitsu 2 Invisible Memories comes out on the PlayStation 2.
2704591	2706372	It has a limited edition as well.
2706412	2707773	It's an adventure game.
2709855	2712177	Can't tell much about this, but it has schoolgirls in it.
2713100	2714080	Well, that could be anything.
2714220	2714741	Exactly.
2715441	2716841	That could be anything, seriously.
2718002	2722723	Looking at the handhelds, because there's usually stuff on the Nintendo DS, even in a slow news week.
2725004	2733347	I don't see a lot of big game names here, but I do show a game called Nanashi no Game from Square Enix is coming out.
2733627	2735067	Trying to figure out what that game is.
2735888	2736948	Action adventure game.
2738851	2739911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2764757	2770281	with a touch panel on one side for the game and the other side showing a full body view of your dancer and her competition.
2770762	2771202	Woohoo!
2772703	2774184	So it's like a dance music game.
2775345	2780449	And lastly, on the PSP in Japan this week, looking to see if there's anything new.
2781189	2785573	Oh, Bleach, Heat the Soul 4 gets a price reduction and moves into best hits.
2786153	2792097	And the Namco Museum Battle Collection expands into an Asia-wide release this week, not just Japan.
2792117	2792858	Man, more Bleach.
2793266	2800151	I was going to say, I have a friend who's touring around in Japan right now, and he asked me if I wanted anything from Japan.
2800572	2807497	So I was going to have him pick me up a copy on PlayStation 3 of Battle Fantasia, which is that really cool-looking fighting game.
2808377	2809118	I wanted to play that.
2809919	2811600	One of my other friends is planning on importing it.
2812250	2816838	So hopefully I get that and I can bring it in and we can do it on JustinTV or something.
2817118	2823568	By the way, in two weeks in Japan, since we were talking about God of War earlier, God of War Chains of Olympus finally comes out in Japan on July 10th.
2823629	2824670	Something to look forward to there.
2824971	2825452	There you have it.
2825692	2826734	Japan release dates.
2829625	2832706	Well, for the UK, there's a few things.
2834127	2858718	On the 30th, actually, GoView is coming out for PSP, and then with the start of the month, we've got on the 2nd, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party on Wii, Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3 for PlayStation 3 on the 3rd, and then on the 4th is Arkanoid DS, Space Invaders Extreme for DS and PSP, The Incredible Hulk on Wii, and Wall-E on damn near everything else, and we love golf!
2859958	2862319	Wait, it's not Dancing Stage Hottest Party?
2862860	2864020	It says Dance Dance Revolution.
2864420	2865221	That's kind of strange.
2867101	2869442	Because I thought they called it Dancing Stage over there.
2869682	2871863	Why is it that they call it Dancing Stage over there anyways?
2871883	2875405	Because Revolution is a taboo term to use in marketing from what I understand.
2877326	2877886	I know why.
2878026	2880907	And if I'm right, also back in the 80s you actually couldn't use Ninja.
2881887	2885309	Like for example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
2886772	2888513	We got weird stuff over here too.
2888653	2893276	So, you know, like, you know, fag is a cigarette over there.
2893316	2894837	But over here it means something much different.
2895157	2895638	You know what I mean?
2895878	2896398	There's little things.
2896418	2897279	And a bundle of sticks.
2897759	2897959	Yes.
2899600	2900281	That's funny.
2901041	2901601	Revolution.
2903602	2905084	Wario Land Shake It
2922381	2926063	Super Paper Mario Kirby Super Star Ultra DS Remake Super Nintendo Game
2950848	2951488	Interesting.
2951528	2953349	Was that the one with all the minigames in it?
2954050	2955291	It's also got minigames in it, yeah.
2955351	2955891	Wow.
2956871	2957212	Okay.
2957872	2960774	And there's also... I had that game.
2961394	2963735	Mystery Case Files Millionaire.
2964776	2966897	Like, error as in, you know, errors.
2967597	2973641	Anyways, and that is a mystery game that I guess is a PC franchise that they're now bringing to the DS.
2974821	2977603	So those, let's see, I believe...
2978906	2992715	September 25th for Kirby Superstar Ultra and September 29th for Mystery Case Files Millionaire and I want to say that Wario...
2994520	2995401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3019224	3022286	So their November and December releases are still a question mark.
3022326	3024288	So there might be some big bombshell in there.
3024348	3026189	And it doesn't really even end in October.
3026209	3028431	It ends basically at October.
3029011	3030132	Because it's all September stuff.
3030852	3031973	Because I don't know.
3032033	3033494	Wario sounds kind of cool.
3033834	3035556	Kirby sure has a lot of diehard fans.
3035836	3039058	But there's not really that OMG title in there.
3039078	3040039	You know what's also weird?
3040739	3042180	I mean, this is weird for Nintendo.
3042220	3046383	Because Nintendo usually releases their games on Sundays.
3046984	3048505	They're switching to Tuesdays now.
3049713	3051514	So they're finally getting normal like everybody else.
3051754	3052295	Yes, I guess.
3052455	3052895	Good for them.
3054196	3067905	Well, switching over to the Xbox 360 for a minute, it's been speculated for a while that one of the things that they are going to announce at E3, along with all that news that got leaked last month, or no, it was about two weeks ago, was the price drop.
3068545	3072508	The Xbox 360, any day now, should be getting some type of price drop, and it looks like
3073228	3079854	It might happen at E3 that they might walk out there on stage and they're going to say we are dropping the price of the Xbox 360.
3079975	3085600	Here's what happened to make us all think that is that apparently a Kmart ad has leaked.
3086080	3089543	It's a Kmart ad that is actually supposed to hit on July 6th.
3090804	3100710	and this ad shows that there is an Xbox 360 20 gig console, meaning it comes with the hard drive, $299.99 and it's being advertised as a new low price.
3101271	3117961	Also supporting the fact that this ad is for the week of July 6th, you see a little box art for Civilization Revolution, it's a game that's coming out that week, that is a game that's scheduled to be out that week, so very interesting that this could be seeing a $50 price drop from the current $349 that folks are paying for this system.
3118301	3119182	We don't know if it's
3119662	3120262	and DarkSakura.
3137298	3140179	But did nobody shop at Kmart?
3140199	3140759	I understand that.
3141659	3146940	But if this is true, then people are going to price match and what have you.
3147600	3151321	They're not going to all of a sudden drop their systems down for whatever.
3151341	3152421	And it says new low price.
3152681	3154242	Not saying on sale.
3155902	3161323	SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, do we get a Rock Us Dukakis t-shirt with our purchase of a 360 at Kmart?
3162823	3163484	Possibly.
3163684	3164024	You know what?
3164084	3164944	I want one of those shirts.
3166667	3167127	Who knows?
3167188	3168269	You might be able to buy some mold.
3168289	3170951	If you want a moldy Xbox 360, that's the thing.
3171632	3175836	If Kmart ends up selling these, it better be for an old skewer.
3175877	3179440	How's Kmart going to get rid of all the 360s that have been sitting on their shelves since launch?
3180181	3181442	Because nobody shops at Kmart.
3181823	3183985	They get price matched.
3184085	3184626	It doesn't matter.
3184666	3186067	They get all that stuff on the back end.
3186107	3186547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3206303	3212907	If you look, and I don't even know why I looked at this when I was looking at this ad here, they have a high-res scan on Joystick.
3213227	3221031	If you look at the very bottom left-hand corner, it says job number 713, so that's when the ad is supposed to hit.
3221491	3227855	I have a feeling somebody else, another retailer, will leak a very similar thing this week, and that's when you know it's the real deal.
3228996	3230837	I'm already on board saying it's the real deal.
3231257	3238401	I mean, look at what was it last year with the whole, I think the first price drop, and also there was the PlayStation 3 stuff too.
3238881	3243004	I think there was some sort of price drop or SKU announcement or something like that that was leaked by that.
3243384	3243624	Right.
3244845	3246246	I think it was the 80 gig or something.
3247026	3247806	Well, there you have it.
3248266	3249187	A price drop coming soon.
3249227	3256809	So if you haven't bought an Xbox 360 yet and you want to, and I say this because we've had some mailbag people write us recently wondering if they should take the plunge and get one now.
3257410	3262591	Maybe you should wait now a couple weeks before this price drop unless you go to a store that's going to honor.
3263712	3268473	Because sometimes stores, like if the price changes within a month, they will give you a refund.
3268614	3271535	I would rather just not risk it and just buy it.
3271795	3272675	Just wait a few more days.
3272935	3273235	Weeks.
3273595	3276176	Just wait a couple more weeks and I think you will be good.
3277157	3278877	And then you might have a reason to shop at Kmart.
3280498	3281699	A reason to shop at Kmart.
3281719	3283820	Pick up some of that hip 80s fashion while you're there.
3284800	3287321	I have bought something at Kmart a year ago.
3287481	3292243	I bought something at Kmart once in the past three years and that's because they were the only place open on Thanksgiving.
3292983	3294264	I bought cereal there.
3295629	3295989	DarkSakura.com
3313230	3313851	You're nasty!
3328147	3354265	and you know we went in there buying okay we only need aluminum foil and like you know a snack and then that's it we ended up walking out with like aluminum or not even aluminum foil because we forgot to get that obviously but we walked out with like bagel bites and like clothes and like all sorts of random shit it's like what the hell what is wrong with this I did buy something important there what I bought flannel sheets for my massage class
3356312	3369877	I almost live literally next door to a freaking Walmart and I don't go there unless I have to because it's scary.
3370257	3371377	That Walmart is scary.
3371417	3372637	The Walmart by my house is cool.
3373038	3373758	Yes, did you see this?
3373978	3376459	Right over there by the freeway they are opening up a Hooters right by my house.
3376499	3377119	We need to go!
3378186	3380726	Dude, we should do our OLR 300th episode live at Hooters.
3381407	3382007	Let's do it!
3382867	3383887	Oh my god, let's do it.
3384167	3384887	I'm serious.
3385667	3386908	Well, we'll have to look into it.
3386988	3389308	But I'm not eating hot wings because their hot wings taste like shit.
3390048	3393509	We'll have to see if they have the facilities for that and if they're not going to charge us too much.
3393549	3397689	But otherwise, I kind of like that idea of doing our 300th episode live from Hooters.
3399930	3400710	We'll have to see.
3401830	3404491	PKJr92 asks, How is it scary, Rob?
3404891	3406191	The Walmart over here just said...
3407250	3410631	There's always people outside asking for money.
3410791	3412491	I have a good way to describe it.
3412511	3415192	When you walk in there, it smells like formaldehyde.
3415452	3416572	I have a good way to describe it.
3416692	3416932	What?
3417392	3420653	Think of the oldest Walmart in the South.
3422233	3424253	And then transpose it to California.
3425014	3426074	Not quite as bad.
3426414	3427934	The floors are at least white.
3428774	3431535	But the quality of consumer...
3432584	3437247	Sadly, I think the Kmart locally here is a little bit more ahead of the times than the Walmart next door.
3437727	3444992	Really, the only difference between Walmarts and Kmarts is Kmart, you have to step on the pad to open the door instead of, you know, the infrared.
3445632	3445993	All right.
3446553	3447634	Enough Kmart chat.
3447674	3448634	Back to gaming news.
3449075	3450275	Sorry.
3450355	3450916	We gotta.
3452277	3452797	We gotta.
3452817	3454378	Tommy is waiting to come on our show.
3454398	3454978	We gotta get to him.
3459036	3466381	Okay, well, hey, we've got some other stuff that's pretty crap news for our friends in the UK.
3467282	3472365	They're supposed to introduce a dual rating system for rating games.
3473586	3479830	One that's the, if I'm right, it's the PEGI, and the other one then to go with the BBFC.
3480671	3480791	And...
3482751	3498003	Anyway, they were talking about the games that were rated 12 plus or above by the PEGI should also be rated by the BBFC, the British Board of Film Classification to also include that, which right now they only rate the 15 and 18.
3501105	3514781	But Microsoft is actually saying that it's going to make the games more expensive because they have to submit them through both rating systems as well as delay their releases.
3515882	3517503	because they have to be approved by both.
3519645	3537740	In fact, to pretty much quote, it was actually said by Neil Thompson, who was one of the executives there, that, quote, we're concerned with any measures that would mean this process is made more unwieldy or incurs additional costs which have to be shared with the consumer.
3538741	3543705	So... So...
3545509	3547870	That's kind of crap, don't you think?
3549050	3550651	Yeah, it kind of sucks that they have to do two.
3550671	3553492	I mean, I don't understand why you just can't stick with one rating system.
3553652	3554153	I know, right?
3554533	3556754	It's basically like, well, we need to rate it too.
3557594	3558314	Well, no.
3559215	3560695	Then just have them rate everything.
3561676	3562756	Get rid of the Peggy system.
3563596	3568778	I don't see why we can't do this in America and why they can't do it everywhere else.
3568819	3572220	Wherever has a movie rating system, apply it to the games.
3573831	3577034	We don't need an ESRB.
3577935	3582320	If people can understand what movie ratings are about, then apply it to video games as well.
3582340	3584002	It's just stupid.
3585364	3585584	I know.
3585945	3589188	But people are even dumber than that, so they won't understand.
3591010	3591291	Oh well.
3593467	3596809	So yet another Microsoft rumor we've got here.
3597769	3599570	And it's kind of interesting.
3600070	3603172	But then again, the source is not entirely credible.
3603272	3605893	So take this with a huge grain of salt.
3607234	3617499	Anyways, this was apparently found from the 4chan forums, which I know they probably already... Wow, that's the most respectable news source I've ever heard on this show.
3617519	3618960	I know, I know, I know.
3619460	3620581	But just...
3621101	3622382	Just reporting it, that's all.
3623542	3626944	There are two screenshots that supposedly leaked from 4chan.
3627044	3627805	Yeah, I know, it's weird.
3628905	3630226	With MyGamerPad.
3630906	3635989	And it's basically kind of like Microsoft's version of Home, it looks like.
3636449	3637690	They've got the avatars.
3639011	3645514	This one screenshot shows that you can invite friends, change your wardrobe, furnishings, etc.
3647675	3648176	And then...
3649421	3651944	The logo for it looks like it's drawn in crayon.
3652745	3653085	I don't know.
3653846	3655508	So, big grain of salt.
3655728	3656269	Definitely.
3656769	3658391	Big grain of salt with that.
3658772	3660974	I don't think there's really an... Excuse me, I'm choking.
3660994	3661154	Go ahead.
3661174	3661214	Um...
3667014	3668315	Yeah, so who knows?
3668375	3680763	I mean, it could be very well photoshopped, but with these kind of announcements that we've been hearing and leaks and stuff about their avatar system and stuff like that, I could definitely see them doing something like this.
3681444	3686867	You know, I think the minute you said, and I'm trying to think of the nicest way to say this, but I can't really think of anything.
3688028	3694672	The minute you said this news comes to us from the 4chan forums, the biggest grain of salt fell from the heavens.
3697434	3721358	Dumped here in studio When you said that When I think news I think CNN MSNBC I don't think 4chan Just saying In case it actually becomes true Exactly I love this comment from Jrod in chat 4chan?
3721698	3722599	Photoshop?
3722979	3725139	Never I know, I know
3731771	3736715	Just in case it's true, you heard it here first.
3736775	3741379	If it's not true, you heard it on the Bobby Blackwolf show.
3743681	3744461	Kidding, Bobby.
3745022	3746503	That should be a new commercial for us.
3751067	3753909	It's time for us to do something here on OLR we haven't done in a while.
3758063	3759184	And that's dance, no.
3760325	3766950	We have a stupid award giveaway tonight, and tonight it's not because of any hideous shooting or anything, thankfully.
3767570	3769652	But this is just no plain stupidity.
3770412	3776937	The news comes to us from the New Haven Advocate, and it is about the Connecticut State Senator Gail Schlossberg.
3777778	3782941	Gail Schlossberg is looking for the rape scene in Grand Theft Auto 4.
3784122	3801176	And going to the actual news article here on NewHavenAdvocate.com She wants confirmation of the rumored rape scene in Grand Theft Auto 4 She is unable, though, to reach that level of the game Hmm, could it possibly be because, I don't know, it doesn't exist?
3801636	3810443	But she's not willing to believe that But she just doesn't believe it Surely, this is a Grand Theft, surely there must be rape
3812370	3817453	Basically, she was putting out a request that someone proved to her that it's not in there.
3819094	3821215	What kind of fucked up logic is that?
3822595	3823616	Prove your innocence!
3823656	3826677	Prove that there is no rape in your game.
3830800	3831880	Need I say more?
3832781	3833581	You're an idiot.
3834441	3836202	This is why politicians suck.
3838043	3839604	Not all, but most.
3840565	3841165	Like this one.
3841840	3843481	They suck once they get to a certain level.
3844641	3846462	Yeah, let us know when you find that scene.
3846702	3852624	You know, but the funny thing is that she's going to be going around forever and ever trying to find that scene and she never will.
3852704	3855565	So, heaven forbid she actually gets some work done.
3856345	3860887	Oh, speaking of Grand Theft Auto 4 though, I did see the most hilarious thing in that.
3861447	3862207	The lap dances.
3863768	3864008	What?
3864248	3864928	They're hilarious.
3865788	3867069	They're so badly animated.
3868969	3873252	I was going to say, she's going to find the lost city of gold before she finds that rape scene in there.
3873392	3876234	Maybe she can find a balanced budget for the state of Connecticut.
3876394	3879075	I don't know if they have the budget problems we do in California.
3879095	3883238	But if this were coming from a California senator, I would be going through the freaking roof.
3883538	3885840	Because they cannot balance a fucking budget in this state.
3885960	3888241	I would be in the middle of the roof right now.
3888261	3891523	Listen, Connecticut, do you really need to lower yourself to Delaware's level?
3891823	3892484	I mean, seriously.
3893985	3894325	All right.
3895546	3895986	You know what?
3896086	3898167	News like this makes us... You know what?
3898207	3898507	Fuck it.
3898527	3899567	It's the FUs of the week.
3908750	3910550	FU to me for using the wrong music tonight.
3910630	3912091	Oh well, a bit of retroness for you guys.
3912131	3912431	Jamie?
3913511	3915132	FU, Rob.
3915392	3919433	I have a few, so I'll try to get through them as quickly as possible.
3920793	3922594	FU to me for...
3924901	3928824	Being so out of it that I made an error in the email.
3929684	3930725	I won't elaborate more.
3932286	3933767	Also, F you to my body.
3934768	3940071	Because I got really sick on Thursday night.
3940091	3941633	Well, technically Friday morning.
3942333	3945115	With some pretty nasty pain in my stomach.
3945275	3946596	I mean, really bad.
3946656	3948777	And I'm not going to go into details because it was fairly disgusting.
3949938	3953781	But I ended up going into the doctor on Friday.
3954682	3966555	and being tested for a peptic ulcer and a few other stomach related problems and got put on quite a number of drugs to help with digestive issues.
3967536	3968537	And one of them is addictive.
3969929	3970329	Fun!
3970589	3972210	Yeah, I know, so I have to be very careful.
3972770	3976091	But, um, and then I'm also being treated for sinus infection.
3976891	3978392	Because we've had smoke!
3978892	3979172	Alright.
3979412	3981713	Pretty bad, awful smoke from the fire.
3981733	3983273	Was it up in Placer County?
3983333	3984554	Fires are, like, all over.
3984594	3985314	It's surrounding.
3985694	3991196	There's fires up in the mountains to Reno, there's fires up in the mountains to the bay, there's fires up north in Chico.
3991236	3992816	I think there's no fires to the south.
3992836	3993917	I think it's the only safe place.
3993957	3994397	Head south.
3994537	3998160	We haven't had any true blue skies in a while.
3998220	4002124	We've had sort of a dusty brown color.
4002264	4007508	True story, if you go onto the Wii forecast channel, at least yesterday, it actually said haze.
4007849	4011652	And it showed that disgusting brown colored cloud for our weather.
4011852	4013554	And that's the first time I've ever seen that in this area.
4014718	4015599	It was just nasty.
4015679	4022585	But the thing is, is that basically we've all been, you know, inhaling, you know, very fine soot, you know, in our air.
4023586	4025328	And I'm not the only one.
4025388	4031233	A lot of people have developed sinus infections just from the damage, you know, caused from inhaling this day in and day out.
4031954	4035797	So, um, F you to fires.
4036918	4039681	Even though I normally like fire, F you to fires on that scale.
4040205	4047391	Wow, Frisbee activated in our Justin.TV chat the weather function, because you can type weather and where we're at.
4047851	4052175	And the official weather on Justin.TV says it's currently 83 degrees Fahrenheit.
4052495	4053115	Conditions?
4053356	4053656	Smoke.
4054758	4058539	Yeah, and today's actually a lot prettier than it has been.
4058699	4058999	Yes.
4059639	4066801	Today is a lot nicer, but on top of that, though, we've had cooler weather because of the haze.
4067581	4071682	However, though, at the hottest part of the day, it has trapped plenty of heat.
4072562	4075643	So, and our hottest part of the day is like, what is it, 3, 4 o'clock?
4075763	4076083	Yeah, about 4.
4076583	4076983	Yeah.
4077143	4078544	Right when the show starts, about 5.
4079671	4094883	so it's it's been on the not fun level and people have been getting sick from it so big F you goes to the the fires and good luck to the people who actually live in those areas yeah definitely um i used to live up in chico where a lot of those fires are happening in that area and i know
4095822	4097263	Friends of friends that have been affected.
4097783	4098503	And it just sucks.
4098643	4100184	There's no real other way to put it.
4100204	4100524	It sucks.
4100664	4105966	I remember going to Julian, which is right outside San Diego, up in the mountains.
4106827	4110668	After they had the big bad forest fires there in the mountains.
4111248	4113629	And seeing what happened to one of the mountain towns.
4114530	4115410	It was just gone.
4115710	4116851	You could see foundations.
4117191	4118371	The whole place was gone.
4119152	4123794	So having seen what happens right after the fire, I just hope that everyone comes through it okay.
4125034	4126676	Alright, well that is it for your FUs.
4126697	4127257	We'll go to Loki.
4142577	4144278	Today's forecast is noobs I bought.
4146879	4153043	I guess FU, this is not a really big FU because I'm not buying them this year, but FU is the safe and sane fireworks.
4153783	4154964	Each year they get worse and worse.
4154984	4155884	It's safe and lame.
4156145	4156885	Safe and lame, yeah.
4157405	4158586	I'm shipping me some Roman cans.
4159026	4161447	This year, Arnold is basically saying, don't buy them.
4162227	4170629	And so, no one's supposed to buy them because apparently, according to him, anyone that sets off fireworks immediately sets off forest fires.
4170669	4172789	Because they're like, don't fire!
4174189	4176310	Loki, you've seen these people.
4176550	4177450	I've seen these people.
4177790	4180131	There are people that are like, don't fire!
4180171	4184572	They're going to listen to Arnold because they're going to be like, I ain't listening to that European.
4185012	4185892	I'll do what I want.
4186032	4186692	I'm American.
4187132	4188413	Right Bear Firearms!
4189173	4191574	And fire is part of that, so... I'm gonna set my arm on fire.
4191594	4193234	Just go fire a gun for the 4th of July.
4193614	4195195	Yeah, fire guns in the air instead.
4195715	4197596	No, um... No, don't.
4197616	4198556	That's really dangerous.
4198596	4199176	Don't do that.
4199536	4201737	Actually, no one can get killed by that.
4201997	4203298	They did it in Mythbusters.
4203318	4203818	It happened.
4203898	4204458	Oh, whatever.
4205058	4208499	Anyway, so, um... Yeah, F you that because those suck.
4208539	4209840	So instead, we're gonna play video games.
4211906	4212867	Is that it for you, FU's of the Week?
4212967	4213127	Yes.
4213327	4215589	Okay, I'll make mine fast, because this is almost over.
4216270	4221694	FU to the fact that when I went to Great America, the best ride at all of Great America was fucking closed on my birthday, and that would be Top Gun.
4221755	4224797	Oh, excuse me, Flight Deck, because they lost all the licensing.
4225057	4229541	But I would like to point out the Survivor ride is still cool, and I rode Invertigo for the first time.
4229882	4231363	And you know why they call that ride Invertigo?
4231403	4233445	Because it inverts your stomach by the time you're off of it.
4233465	4234265	I thought I was going to hurl.
4234305	4234826	Then you have to go.
4235598	4237520	And then, yeah, then I thought I was going to, like, tinkle.
4237900	4239041	But, my pants.
4239322	4244266	But I got to raid the Demon, like, three times in a row, because there was no lines on Thursday.
4244286	4244887	It was awesome.
4244927	4249231	The Demon is, like, the best ride ever, next to Top Gun, Flight Deck, whatever the fuck ever it's called.
4249911	4252594	And then the other FU would go to the Fires here, which suck.
4253154	4256137	And that's all I can think of for right now, so that's it.
4257776	4258878	That's going to do it for the FU's of the week.
4259059	4260081	We almost ran out of music.
4260101	4261203	We almost ran out of music.
4261243	4261985	I had to cut it short.
4262386	4265372	Well, we have some other music right now we have to get to.
4271835	4272296	DarkSakura.com
4290353	4291213	Hi, LLR.
4291413	4293574	Well, hi, Sky, because this question is for him.
4293754	4294094	Goodie.
4294514	4297695	Rob, you said that you only have two songs that you like in In the Groove.
4297775	4298556	What songs are they?
4298956	4301136	Personally, my favorite song from that game is Do You Love Me.
4301236	4302017	Thanks, Osfer.
4302717	4310439	My two favorite songs in In the Groove, actually, there would be three, because I kind of like Lemmings on the Run, and then outside of that, I like the Banzai songs.
4310539	4314320	I like Zodiac, and I like Anubis.
4314840	4315141	That's it.
4315181	4316261	I like the Gen Z with that.
4318186	4320108	I'm just not big in the groove music.
4320188	4322731	I like MC Front a lot though.
4323152	4324333	Some of it's okay.
4324633	4329278	Like I like the Shusha song because it makes me think of Telemundo.
4329979	4332181	Anyway, that's really it.
4335495	4336135	Next email.
4336556	4337276	Dun-dun-dun!
4357629	4361131	and then addressed to me a classic game of the week and it's from Richard.
4361772	4365514	And I love the 19XX series and I would love to see an updated one.
4365714	4366434	Seriously.
4366514	4367515	That would be so sweet.
4368155	4368736	Am I crazy?
4368776	4370137	I thought I saw one was in planning.
4371838	4372418	I don't know.
4372458	4375720	They have a remake of 1942 coming out to Xbox Live Arcade.
4375780	4381403	I thought I had heard something about one of the 19 something something games being remade or something was happening.
4381483	4383925	So you might get your wish sooner than you thought.
4385566	4386006	Next up.
4391361	4395125	Would a takeover by EA of Take-Two be good for the gaming industry?
4395225	4398048	Consider 2K Sports and the GTA franchise.
4398128	4398929	A lot is at stake.
4399389	4403173	I personally prefer a takeover than for EA to spin off Rockstar.
4405786	4415130	I, I, this, you know, even though I'm not much of a sports game player, I don't think it's a good idea to have 2K Sports and EA, your two biggest sports game makers, in the same roof.
4415510	4417050	I just think that's kind of a bad idea.
4417310	4418351	That'd monopolize the market.
4418471	4419051	Yeah.
4419631	4429735	You know, as far as the rest of it goes, you know, I don't know enough about the inner workings of the game industry and how, you know, how much freedom the current teams would have to continue to develop their products if this happened.
4429995	4457569	but that would be my number one concern would be the monopoly of the sports games and that there's really no one else who is wanting to step up and challenge that monopoly of course the fact that EA holds that whole exclusive license thing doesn't help next up and this comes from Ben I cannot believe that you guys didn't jump on this show 284, 6 year anniversary show at 1 hour 7 minutes and 40 second mark Guitar Hero Tool
4458857	4460798	Comic Freakin' Gold, no one jumped on it.
4460859	4463300	My ears are just burning for one of you to jump on this zinger.
4464121	4465742	Was it Loki that said this to your guest?
4465822	4468024	Regardless, you should all have been all over this one.
4468444	4470866	Oh well, peace guys, keep up the great work, and congrats on six years.
4471206	4472367	That was Andrew that said it.
4472747	4474449	I thought it was someone in chat that had said it.
4475549	4481654	I just said Tool would be cool, but... But I think the joke there is that you're kind of a tool if you keep buying all these Guitar Hero games.
4483175	4484236	Alright, yeah, we missed it.
4484816	4488179	No, I just said that I actually wouldn't mind a Tool edition, because I like Tool.
4489705	4496476	Wow, we did get a couple of different long ones.
4496536	4500542	Anyway, this one comes from...
4502714	4505956	Well, it's signed Rickchard, so I'm just going to go with that.
4506617	4507717	Happy Friday, OLR.
4507757	4508898	It's Friday when I write this.
4508938	4509899	Hope you have a good weekend.
4510599	4511660	Oh Lord, Smash Bros.
4512180	4512961	is out in the UK.
4513141	4515282	Why has it taken so long to come out here?
4515863	4517584	We always get screwed over with releases.
4517664	4518545	What the fuck, Nintendo?
4519085	4522727	Seriously, you need to pull your thumb out of your arse and get some decent games out soon.
4523228	4527070	I recently completed Metroid on the Wii, and I do believe it was a superb game.
4527451	4532334	However, I can't help but think that there were some areas that could have been improved so easily.
4533134	4534275	It could have been incredible.
4535136	4537538	The story and writing could have been more immersive and compelling.
4538078	4543102	Let's face it, you didn't really care about why you were shooting at those spiky space pirates.
4543383	4546285	You just wanted to get to the next pretty stage with a new and bigger gun.
4547186	4553551	The cutscenes in this day and age were pretty poor.
4553971	4559295	Don't tell me it's because the Wii is underpowered, the PS2 could pull off cinematic and exciting cutscenes for God's sake.
4559756	4561597	Take a look at Eternal Darkness Retro.
4562698	4563319	One last thing.
4563779	4565301	I love being in Samus' ship.
4565701	4570226	It was so cool pressing all of those buttons.
4570947	4574370	Now, did I miss something or does the best button do nothing at all?
4574931	4575892	You know which one I mean.
4575912	4577413	The one that makes the big gun appear.
4578274	4583017	It could have been a fantastic bonus to fly off into space and shoot baddies from this fresh perspective.
4583677	4584598	Okay, bitching over.
4585158	4587980	You don't have to read this out as I know you hate long emails.
4588160	4589121	I don't hate long emails.
4589861	4592563	And may have nominated myself for an FU of the week.
4592783	4595104	Oh shit, I just realized that I'm making it longer.
4595184	4596065	Oh shit, I did it again.
4596165	4596865	Oh fuck, go balls.
4596905	4597626	Shit, fuck ours.
4599027	4600427	He's just trying to get me to say that.
4600588	4601148	That was funny.
4602310	4602690	It worked.
4602970	4603431	See you later.
4603471	4605672	This email brought to you by Chardin is never ending.
4605692	4608954	Wait for some kind of goddamn RTS Command & Conquer game for the Wii.
4610154	4610395	Nice.
4612015	4613216	That was... Funny email.
4614057	4614557	Quite.
4615477	4615938	Next up.
4616138	4616798	Dun-dun-dun.
4618139	4618799	Hi, everyone.
4619179	4619420	Hi.
4619540	4620000	Hi.
4622421	4623962	I have a few questions for the three of you.
4624622	4624742	One.
4624963	4625123	No.
4625143	4625123	42.
4625603	4628585	Alright, go ahead.
4628645	4629265	I hear the answer's 42.
4629325	4629545	Go ahead.
4632728	4636931	Have you ever had what could be termed as holy crap moments as they relate to gaming?
4637311	4649118	An example may be like when you've seen your first video game or arcade as a youngster, or maybe seen a game that was light years ahead of its contemporaries in some regards.
4649438	4650659	Final Fantasy VII, anyone?
4651439	4655442	Furthermore, how heavily do these holy crap moments factor into your decision to stay with gaming?
4656767	4666513	If you want a recent example, play Lost Odyssey, and the first time one of those text-only stories comes up on the screen, the memories, that was kind of one of those, holy crap, type moments.
4667033	4669014	And I think that was exactly like the way I said it, too.
4669134	4669895	So there you have it.
4670295	4672516	As far as, what was the second half of the question?
4672556	4675978	How does it play into... And your decision to stick with gaming.
4678356	4683198	I like to say holy crap at movies, but sometimes I like to laugh at movies, sometimes I like to cry at movies.
4683378	4687080	Not that I really cry at video games, but I like to have fun.
4687360	4690761	So it doesn't necessarily have to be a holy crap moment, but they help.
4691881	4702065	I think that my last holy crap moment... I remember one of my early holy crap moments was when you're doing the train cart ride in Final Fantasy VI.
4703453	4705781	I was like, oh my god, it's like Indiana Jones!
4706162	4706945	I've got a headache!
4707788	4708069	Nice.
4708737	4712960	But, you know, every so often I run into a game that gives me those happy moments like that.
4713060	4719124	So I think I keep playing to, you know, find more of those happy times.
4719205	4720125	I thought of one other one.
4720145	4728031	How about Symphony of the Night when you get the real ending, quote unquote, and then you go into the upside down castle and you realize you have to play the whole fucking game all over again.
4728071	4728731	And it's harder.
4728811	4729412	Oh, yeah.
4729432	4730553	That was kind of one of those.
4730613	4731273	Oh, my God.
4731473	4733555	Or how long it took me to freaking get a jewel sword.
4734395	4734976	That sucked.
4734996	4735136	Yeah.
4736741	4740143	No, I'll tell you what took even longer was getting the freaking Yatatsuna.
4740964	4743005	Having to fight the werewolf.
4743505	4744366	That was a pain in the butt.
4745266	4746287	Anyway, number two.
4746547	4750710	A few episodes back, Rob mentioned that he was interested in the HD remake of Commando 3 for the 360.
4751030	4754472	I'm interested in his opinion on it, assuming that he's played it.
4755092	4756113	I haven't, sorry.
4756173	4757234	It's on my to-do list.
4758334	4758795	Naughty me.
4759815	4760696	Well, number three then.
4761917	4768144	Have the three of you considered making up some goofy as all hell sounding catchphrases or words to use on air?
4768685	4770587	I found that using such things can be quite fun.
4770627	4772409	My personal favorite is snot puppy.
4773050	4774692	Don't ask, I don't know what it means either.
4774732	4778156	I made it up a few years ago after having way too much Crown Royal and Labat Blue.
4779249	4786774	I like twat waffle myself, but I didn't make that up, so I can't really claim that I made that up.
4787475	4788736	But I like twat waffle.
4789396	4793939	But you know what, those types of things, you can't force, like, you can't make fetch happen.
4794019	4795380	Stop trying to make fetch happen.
4795601	4797342	Those types of things have to happen naturally.
4798763	4799063	Next.
4799403	4800084	You twat waffle.
4802042	4805544	Do you know of any places where I can buy video game soundtracks, preferably on CD?
4805945	4811068	I know of sites where I can get them less than honestly.
4811509	4813850	But I want to support video game music with my hard-earned money.
4814311	4817133	Kino Kuniya?
4817673	4818654	CD Japan?
4818894	4819674	Amazon.
4820095	4822156	Yeah, Amazon has a lot of that stuff.
4822176	4822877	They've got everything.
4824543	4827904	and actually they're releasing legitimate ones in the US plenty of times now.
4828164	4836446	If you don't prefer shopping online, you like to walk into a store and look at the real thing, try like comic book stores locally because I know one of the ones here has them.
4836526	4837767	So it depends where this guy lives.
4838467	4840888	Try like comic book stores and other nerdy type stores.
4840908	4841428	You never know.
4841588	4843568	It might be a small selection but they'll probably have it.
4843608	4848510	Like the local comic book store here has the Final Fantasies, the DDRs, you know, the big stuff.
4849190	4849310	So...
4851385	4852986	Alright, last question.
4854627	4859149	On a similar note, once I move, I'll be considering buying one to two, three arcade machines.
4859589	4862910	I've never bought any before in my life.
4862930	4865331	With that being said, what advice as pointers can you give me?
4865812	4872335	If it helps at all, all the games I'll consider were made between 1978 and 1998 and span across virtually every genre.
4872435	4877397	I'll tell you probably the best thing you're going to be able to do for your money is to get an EOGO AVS machine.
4878880	4879240	Oh, yeah.
4897336	4900617	Once in a while you see those Ultra Kade-ish things pop up.
4900637	4905939	I remember Target was running one like two Christmases ago and I think Costco once in a while has one too.
4906239	4907559	You have to really keep your eye out for them.
4907599	4912741	They usually show up around the holidays but another multi-game in one system and very, very classic stuff.
4913241	4915402	We built a MAME cabinet out of a pole position stand-up.
4915622	4915842	Nice.
4916462	4917222	So you could do that too.
4918343	4919063	MAME is fun.
4920223	4924344	Sorry for the somewhat lengthy email and thank you for taking the time to read it as well as answer my questions.
4924925	4925405	You're welcome.
4925485	4926085	That'll be a dollar.
4926573	4927214	Last email.
4927854	4928115	All right.
4928195	4929116	This is the long one.
4929576	4930137	Oh, my gosh.
4930397	4931398	I thought that was the long one.
4931438	4931759	All right.
4932119	4932379	All right.
4932439	4933180	Last one.
4933340	4934722	Hello and good show to everyone.
4934762	4937445	This is... It's Rini, right?
4942346	4943927	A very long time since I've written in.
4944027	4949032	To begin, I'd like to touch on Knuckles Chaotix as featured on DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week from a couple episodes ago.
4949793	4953197	A correction, the characters were not rendered in 3D, they were sprite-based.
4953537	4955399	What was in 3D were the special stages.
4955859	4956620	Sorry, they looked rendered.
4957541	4963886	An interesting note on said special stages, you can complete them all to get an obligatory set of jewels that need to be acquired.
4964267	4970852	However, as an extra challenge, players could compete in special stages again, only this time the stages were drawn in wireframes.
4971333	4979580	To make it even more devious, the wireframe versions, you only had flickering verticals of the polygons to go by to avoid the holes as best as possible.
4980400	4984221	DarkSakura also touched on Sonic Crackers, the presumed prototype for Chaotix.
4984701	4994764	Not necessarily a tip, but for anyone who's played the old side-scrolling Sonic games, should go online and read up on the analyses for earlier ROM dumps that were meant for developers' eyes.
4995264	5000325	Interesting bits include tiny nuances such as the pixel-perfect placement of the score, ring...
5001005	5011469	and Life Indicators on screen to the creepy sounding Genocide City Zone, an alternative stage that was supposed to be a meltdown version of the Chemical Plant Zone in Sonic 2 that players would reach later in the game.
5011669	5013129	It's a nice way to kill an afternoon.
5013329	5014450	I love prototypes, though.
5014970	5016510	I love looking for prototype games.
5016530	5024393	I actually have a couple of prototypes that were released for Atari 5200, like Millipede.
5025213	5025453	Hot.
5025953	5026634	I know it is hot.
5027014	5027254	And Ms.
5027274	5027574	Pac-Man.
5029073	5031814	For the other half of this email, it's not quite half, it's more like a third.
5032674	5040298	I listened to your anniversary shows, Ask Orange Knowledge, Radio Segment, and Bobby Blackwolf asked how Konami could improve the American Bimani situation.
5040498	5045880	Very briefly, was poppin' music mentioned as to how it could be brought over, which it should.
5046380	5050321	This is the obvious issue of localizing it, but there's another problem, content.
5050742	5053643	Correct me if I'm wrong, but poppin' has a lot of songs unfit for the U.S.
5054063	5055944	I was mulling over this for a while and thought of a different...
5056764	5056904	Agreed.
5056924	5057324	Absolutely agree.
5057344	5058905	They don't have to just copy the same damn game.
5058925	5059045	Agreed.
5074531	5078217	If you want my take on this, Konami should have a video game themed song list.
5078657	5085567	In optimal situation, the US song list would consist of part KOs, part licenses, and part songs from video games.
5085668	5087350	Not just Konami either, here's why.
5087831	5088932	In my personal preference...
5090254	5092555	We should get a poppin' Wii and take Smash Bros.
5092595	5095837	Brawl approach, because the Wii is selling downloads, etc.
5097557	5112724	Imagine Konami being able not only to access music from every Nintendo console release, but also from any console services on the Virtual Console, aka anything before PS1 in any sort of relevance, although technically you can have access to an entirety of Sega's offerings, too.
5113564	5120426	Imagine playing the goddamn hardcore remix of Gourmet Race from Kirby Superstars that's on Brawl on Poppin'.
5122146	5124747	It says, holy shit, shut up, sexy ferret, OMG.
5126307	5135789	Seriously, imagine Konami having access to those vast assets and putting select songs into Poppin' earlier in their original chiptune form or gloriously remixed from Modernization.
5136850	5138290	They had an Anamelo version, though.
5138561	5139261	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5166507	5170890	Guitar Hero, Rock Music, DDR, Dance Music
5182998	5184180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5197822	5199483	Okay, the last third of the email.
5213789	5217630	Oh, and it'd be a double as filler for Japanese releases, but no one cares for that.
5218230	5221631	This email has run too long, so I'd like to give a chance for another listener to give their input.
5221951	5229673	Before I finish, however, I'd like to chastise the OLR host, Minkletov, and the Andrew Junami, the Zephyr, is that how it's pronounced?
5229693	5230253	Yeah, Zephyr.
5230833	5234134	For the listless selections for the best Mimani songs on the 6th anniversary show.
5234514	5236775	How could you neglect Scorpion Fire from 2DX Red?
5237395	5240075	And I'm talking about the epic 8-minute long version 1-2.
5240095	5240236	You're...
5242679	5245080	You're all mean, but points to Loki for canceling out Zephyr.
5245781	5253325	This message was brought to you by the Metallic Rose DS Lite, because baiting and switching target for your coral pink light for Metallic Rose just feels right.
5253785	5254786	Yes, I really did do this.
5254926	5256827	Shame on you, but that's funny.
5256847	5260149	That was an epic email.
5260249	5261449	Epic email is very epic.
5262310	5263651	All right, let's get back to the news.
5263751	5264191	We still got Tommy.
5264211	5264411	Yes, please.
5264431	5264931	Let's get to it.
5270585	5275446	So there's some interesting patents filed by Sony here.
5275946	5282527	In fact, people are speculating it's for the next PSP or whatever system they're going to be calling it.
5283228	5292869	Anyways, the patent was granted for a handheld device with touchscreen and digital tactile pixels.
5294490	5296910	So it's kind of interesting.
5297614	5301095	And I have no idea what they claim digital tactile pixels are.
5302056	5312760	It says, as for digital tactile pixels, claims 19 through 30 of the patent suggests that vibration acts as a tactile response.
5314201	5315821	So what, a PSP with a touch screen?
5316562	5318983	Well, like you would touch it and it would vibrate or something.
5319323	5319723	Interesting.
5319763	5320844	Tickling game.
5322264	5323485	Hey, it might be fun.
5323505	5324305	Yeah.
5326448	5333583	well who knows what that's going to be but something's in the works which is not surprising very interesting um
5336576	5341438	Apparently, and I apologize because this link here on our roll is broken.
5342198	5344119	Hopefully, maybe Loki can help me out a little bit here.
5344199	5347480	Kingdom Hearts 3 apparently was rumored to be in the next Nintendo Power.
5347540	5348220	What is up with that?
5349461	5351942	Well, we already kind of talked about that, actually.
5352002	5352622	Kingdom Hearts 3?
5353042	5357604	No, we only talked about some of the other stuff in the Nintendo Power League, but apparently they're saying something about Kingdom Hearts 3?
5358044	5359484	No, it was a thing that was rumored.
5359604	5363606	There was a sword in the new... I remember Jamie talked about it, actually.
5363826	5364106	Oh, really?
5364126	5364206	Yeah.
5364710	5365871	KingHeart3
5388715	5389376	Oh, I get it.
5390697	5393799	Oh, I see, because that happens in the comments to this little news story here.
5393859	5395360	Well, who knows?
5395880	5401584	But I don't think... They've already got two Kingdom Hearts games in the pipeline that aren't even out yet, so you're full of crap.
5402245	5402545	That's it.
5404206	5404766	I'm full of crap?
5404886	5405347	No, not you.
5405727	5410970	The people who are trying to say Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out on the Wii.
5410990	5412331	I totally doubt that.
5412932	5413772	Well, we'll see you next month.
5414073	5414493	Yeah, it's true.
5415453	5425979	There is some news regarding Crave and the ESA, as in Crave said bye to the ESA, which is the Entertainment Software Association.
5427139	5440867	They actually sent a report into... They actually confirmed, sorry, a report on Game Politics that Crave Entertainment was basically splitting, that they decided not to renew their membership, and they're off to, I guess...
5441667	5442308	Do their own thing.
5442608	5446832	The other departures that left were the Vendy Activision, LucasArts.
5449634	5451676	A bunch of those other things you were talking about previously.
5452697	5454579	Interesting that one more has now joined them.
5454599	5457001	But then again, I try to think, what has Crave done lately?
5458442	5459083	Nothing I can think of.
5459844	5461025	World Championship Poker.
5461745	5462126	Yippee.
5462706	5462866	Yeah.
5462886	5463207	Yeah.
5464150	5472374	So I guess this isn't exactly, it's not nearly as big as Activision Vivendi not going, but it is interesting that the exodus continues nonetheless.
5472714	5472874	Yep.
5475723	5481608	Well, one thing that's been gone for a while that's actually just come back is Nestor.
5482148	5484670	Yes, Nestor from Nintendo Power.
5485111	5487713	You remember Nestor and Howard.
5488073	5488434	Of course.
5488494	5489434	Or Howard and Nestor, I guess.
5490155	5493478	And their exploits and, you know, chronicled in Nintendo Power.
5493498	5500824	Well, now, after a, you know, hiatus of quite a long time, he's back and grown up.
5501644	5503866	And it's interesting because now he's...
5505526	5505888	I don't know.
5506974	5508884	Losing at Mario Kart apparently from the picture.
5510489	5511049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5541557	5548961	I told everyone I'm going to give everybody a hard time because they kept ragging on me for Saturn games and for Sega love.
5549001	5550942	So I picked a Sega Saturn game.
5551202	5551582	Awesome.
5552362	5555504	I picked Astal, which is known as... Oh, awesome.
5555564	5556405	That's what it's known as?
5558446	5559406	It is awesome, I know.
5560106	5564849	It's... Kisui Shodensetsu Astaru.
5566430	5568911	This game is the fucking shit, is what it is.
5569825	5573101	It's a 2D side-scroller, and listen to this music, isn't it pretty?
5581785	5587689	It's just one of those gorgeous 2D games that came out fairly early in the Saturn's life.
5588149	5597494	And it really is just a beautiful game that really shows just the amazing 2D capabilities that the Saturn had.
5597755	5601397	I'm sorry, the PlayStation would not have been able to make this game look this gorgeous.
5601597	5602057	I'm sorry.
5602617	5605059	It had the 2D capability of...
5606886	5607607	A Snotty Nose
5623994	5633702	Basically, as you go through the game, you actually get a little partner that goes with you called Lita.
5634523	5637906	That you'd be able to...
5639907	5640207	and so on.
5657117	5667642	Um, but you could also, um, you know, punch things and jump things and you could, you know, stun your enemies by punching them and you can throw objects and lift humongous things.
5668303	5675186	And you also had this sort of super breath attack that you would inhale and then just blow it all out and blow all the enemies away.
5676387	5680909	And it's just a really, really, really cool game.
5683840	5684901	Alright, there you have it.
5685061	5693892	Also, just to mention, if anyone read the Sonic the Hedgehog comic books that Archie Comics did, Astall shows up a whole bunch in the background.
5694393	5700240	If you can find a YouTube of there's a volcano level, it's fucking awesome.
5701021	5702223	Best music in the game, I think.
5704665	5705967	This is the first level of the game.
5722128	5726589	There's actually another couple of neat trivia things about it.
5726649	5727090	Sure, go ahead.
5727210	5733332	The US release of the game has it where the title does not appear on the side of the case.
5734312	5735712	All you get is the Sega Saturn logo.
5737133	5746756	And it also has music hidden in the game, which is basically the music from the intro, where you can just put it in a CD player and listen to it.
5747416	5749457	It has lyrics in the Japanese version.
5749517	5749797	It's just...
5750817	5751938	Instrumental in the US one.
5752338	5755621	And there's also in the game's graphic files is a sprite of Mario.
5759884	5761305	So there's your trivia.
5761825	5762846	Alright, cool.
5762926	5764687	So check that out on the Sega Saturn.
5764707	5767249	Is it a pretty easy game to find or kind of hard at this point?
5767329	5771072	Hard at this point, but if you can find it, definitely go for it.
5772252	5774234	I know there are images of it available.
5775017	5776538	All right, we're finally going to take a break here.
5776578	5778740	We're pretty long this segment here, over an hour and a half.
5778861	5780983	So we're going to take a break here.
5781003	5782664	When we come back, more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5782704	5787388	Not a whole lot in our next segment news-wise because we're going to have a nice long interview with Tommy Tallarico.
5787428	5794075	He's going to be here to talk about Video Games Live, the gang audio network guild that's going to be pretty cool.
5794595	5797838	And so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5797858	5798479	So stay tuned.
