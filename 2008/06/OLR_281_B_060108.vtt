WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio for this live part B

00:04.640 --> 00:09.280
That we're taping on June 1st of 2008 and for those of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed

00:09.280 --> 00:13.760
You're probably going hey, wait a minute. I I'm not hearing you guys live. We can always join us

00:13.760 --> 00:21.380
We tape live on all games comm that's all games radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time 9 o'clock Eastern

00:21.800 --> 00:28.720
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show the man in Atlanta, Georgia tapes his show live on Sunday nights as well

00:28.720 --> 00:31.760
And if you haven't heard his show, you really should check that out in iTunes

00:31.760 --> 00:36.520
So we make appearances on the show every week Bobby's kind enough to have us on the show to do a little cross-promotion

00:37.400 --> 00:41.400
Speaking of taping the show live you guys in the podcast didn't get to hear this

00:41.400 --> 00:46.920
But we were actually listening to some of the tracks from the Metal Gear Solid 4 soundtrack during the break there

00:46.920 --> 00:52.240
What did you guys think of it? I thought some of it sounded pretty awesome myself epic soundtrack soundtrack is epic

00:52.240 --> 00:57.640
Yes, epic soundtrack is very epic Loki. I know you were good watching some more scenes from postal there during the break

00:57.640 --> 00:59.640
but yeah, I'm I'm a

01:00.400 --> 01:03.080
Minute or an hour 11 into it and it's an hour

01:03.440 --> 01:08.640
47 minute movie out of curiosity those you guys in chat chat that orange laundry calm. Did you guys enjoy that?

01:09.400 --> 01:15.120
Let us know in chat. All right. Meanwhile, we are gonna get back into some gaming news here on this part B

01:15.120 --> 01:20.400
There's plenty of stuff to talk about. I don't think we mentioned the Wii at all in part a so and I got by the

01:20.400 --> 01:22.760
Way, I got a game this week boom blocks

01:22.760 --> 01:27.680
One of my friends kind of hooked me up with a copy of it looked completely legitimate

01:27.680 --> 01:30.440
He just had some inside connections got me a pretty cheap copy of it

01:30.440 --> 01:32.760
So, uh, I'm looking forward to checking it out cool

01:32.760 --> 01:37.280
So I'll have a review on that next week, but we're not gonna talk about boom blocks right away, right? No

01:37.600 --> 01:41.980
No, we're talking about something that's a little bit more interesting. I guess

01:42.720 --> 01:49.080
Portal everybody loves portal. Well now you can play portal on your DS or a version of it

01:49.080 --> 01:54.800
It's a game called still alive DS. It is a 2d portal home brew game

01:55.480 --> 01:57.400
you remember the

01:57.400 --> 02:00.240
Flash game that they had out there that was kind of similar to the portal

02:00.240 --> 02:04.280
Well, this is kind of similar to that flash game a little bit more cartoony

02:04.280 --> 02:11.600
but if you own a flash card or means of putting a homebrew on your DS, you can download this game for free and

02:12.180 --> 02:14.180
It looks pretty awesome actually

02:14.180 --> 02:19.400
Download it now before lawsuits. I'm actually going to because I have a ninja pass. So

02:20.280 --> 02:22.320
definitely worth checking out it uses the

02:23.180 --> 02:29.040
Touchscreen as well as you know, some of the face buttons on there for launching different portals and stuff. So pretty cool

02:29.040 --> 02:35.040
I will have to play a dark soccer's copy because I don't think I'll be getting to check this out. Otherwise

02:35.640 --> 02:37.640
But it sounds interesting. Yeah

02:38.360 --> 02:44.120
I'm definitely gonna definitely gonna download that cuz you know me and my my minor portal obsession

02:44.120 --> 02:51.000
So I'll have to and folks in chat are playing it right now. Nintendo maniac 64 says ironically. I'm playing still live DS right now

02:51.160 --> 02:54.840
Let's have T says it's rather hard to control. How the hell do I shoot the orange one?

02:54.920 --> 02:59.880
maybe you guys can put your heads together and if you want ones by pushing down on the directional pad or

03:00.520 --> 03:01.800
I

03:01.800 --> 03:06.000
want to say a or see if there's instructions and read them down or a and

03:06.680 --> 03:10.240
The you know, two shoulder buttons are the blue portals. So that's how you do it

03:10.240 --> 03:14.960
Well, thank you very much. You're like a Nintendo game counselor all of a sudden. I love it

03:14.960 --> 03:22.680
Well, they had it they have the screenshots of our I guess artwork shots of the controls. So they're all over the internet

03:23.800 --> 03:24.520
All right

03:24.520 --> 03:31.440
Well the latest issue of Japan's for me to magazine has given us some insight as to what's going on with the Sim City

03:31.640 --> 03:37.760
Series here's the deal Sim City creator is gonna be a new game in the Sim City vein and

03:37.760 --> 03:41.000
It's gonna be coming out for the Wii and the DS

03:41.080 --> 03:48.880
it's gonna be coming out September 22nd of 2008 for North America and September 19th a little bit earlier for Europe and the

03:49.080 --> 03:52.400
Japan and other Asia regions and here's the interesting thing

03:52.400 --> 03:58.400
Is that the Wii game what you can do you can draw your own rivers or tracks using the Wiimote?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.440
You can actually change different styles of your buildings as well

04:01.440 --> 04:05.400
You can do like a Chinese style building an Indian design kind of interesting

04:05.400 --> 04:07.800
You can also make buildings made out of candy

04:08.400 --> 04:10.000
or Chris

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Jamie got so excited. She dropped the mic

04:12.880 --> 04:17.840
She was like a candy palace. I was like saying, you know, you can do like a gingerbread house

04:17.840 --> 04:23.640
Well, it makes me think of the opening scene or one of the opening scenes in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the newer one

04:23.720 --> 04:26.080
Did you see the newer one with Johnny Depp? Oh

04:26.800 --> 04:31.540
It's great. That's all I'll say. There's a scene with a chocolate Indian Palace. It's great

04:31.540 --> 04:36.940
Anyhow, also it uses the Wi-Fi connection feature so you can show off the game to friends

04:37.100 --> 04:41.100
So that's kind of cool, especially when you draw those rivers shaped like penises

04:41.780 --> 04:46.660
Which I'm sure a lot of you will be showing each other. There you have some pervy people. There you go

04:47.140 --> 04:49.420
So I'd be called like chocolate check that out

04:49.420 --> 04:54.300
I I loved the first SimCity game that SimCity

04:54.500 --> 04:57.580
2000 and beyond was a little much for me, but I loved the first one

04:57.580 --> 05:02.100
But you know when it gets into too much micromanaging I get like in SimCity 2000

05:02.100 --> 05:06.540
You had to manage the water system with the pipes and everything. It was too much too much

05:07.420 --> 05:12.660
That's why they hire, you know different people to do those jobs blade 3 and check out very excited

05:12.660 --> 05:14.660
He says awesome candy rules

05:15.100 --> 05:19.860
Candy does rule you can have Candyland. It does depend. Yeah, you could actually make Candyland

05:19.860 --> 05:26.060
That'd be great. With peppermint stick. You could actually make Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. That would be so awesome

05:26.060 --> 05:32.020
Yes, I want a river of chocolate. That's right. And I want a wall that tastes like snozzleberry

05:32.780 --> 05:34.780
There's no such thing

05:36.220 --> 05:38.220
Okay, anyway

05:38.820 --> 05:40.820
for people interested in other

05:41.420 --> 05:44.580
Culinary related games that are actually related to food

05:45.740 --> 05:47.740
There's going to be another Cooking Mama

05:47.740 --> 05:49.740
World Kitchen

05:50.500 --> 05:54.460
To be released later this year around October ish

05:55.620 --> 05:59.140
They actually have Majesco has a coming soon

05:59.900 --> 06:02.820
With a release date of October 30th. It's also

06:03.740 --> 06:08.220
That's replacing dinner with friends. As you remember there's Cooking Mama 2 on the DS

06:08.220 --> 06:11.120
This was going to be Cooking Mama 2 on the Wii

06:11.780 --> 06:14.940
But I don't know if they changed the title or actually going to change the game

06:14.940 --> 06:20.780
But it was supposed to be coming out in June now. It's in October. They need to have Redneck Cooking Mama. Look, I'm

06:21.460 --> 06:26.900
They have a game. We make fish sticks. They have a game called Order Up. My roommate just ate that for dinner

06:26.900 --> 06:30.460
Did you smell that inside the house or something? That's hilarious. No, actually

06:31.340 --> 06:35.900
Fish sticks. Funny you should mention that. I walked in the house. I'm like it smells good in here. What did you make for dinner?

06:36.460 --> 06:41.780
Fish sticks. You said fish sticks. No, I said funny that you should mention like a Redneck Cooking game because they're gonna have

06:41.780 --> 06:47.300
Order Up, which is basically like Cooking Mama, but you're working at like a fast food restaurant.

06:47.540 --> 06:53.700
Yeah, they need to have Truck Stop Diner. That would be great. Don't they have Diner Dash? Yeah, same thing. No

06:54.220 --> 06:55.540
All right

06:55.540 --> 07:01.820
Anyhow, sorry. Look, I just hope Cooking Mama Wii kind of blew chunks compared to the DS version

07:01.820 --> 07:03.820
So I really hope they do a better

07:04.540 --> 07:09.780
DS to Wii port this time. The closer you are to the screen the more tight the control would be. That's how I say.

07:09.780 --> 07:15.420
It's... I did not enjoy Cooking Mama on the Wii, although I own it and I'm kind of upset I do

07:16.380 --> 07:18.380
anyways

07:18.460 --> 07:23.380
Now the Wii was... the Virtual Console is supposed to be getting MSX games for quite a while

07:24.180 --> 07:26.180
Finally, Japan has had their first

07:26.420 --> 07:33.540
MSX game release and it's a game called Aleste and what's kind of interesting though is that

07:33.540 --> 07:40.900
is that there's been some additional options to this game that no other Virtual Console game has including the

07:42.540 --> 07:45.980
MSX option menu which allows you to select between

07:47.780 --> 07:48.780
The

07:48.780 --> 07:52.580
MXX hardware-based music and the more advanced FM music that

07:53.060 --> 07:57.980
Back when the MSX was actually a console was in add-on card

07:58.460 --> 08:02.380
So that's pretty cool that you can actually do this in the game by

08:02.380 --> 08:04.780
pressing the minus button

08:06.060 --> 08:10.420
I actually just think that it's cool that that they're getting that game because it's a really freaking good game

08:10.420 --> 08:16.540
And you can also do I guess there's some button change options as well thrown in there. So I

08:17.300 --> 08:22.860
Don't know that's kind of neat that they're adding all these options almost like an actual emulator for this

08:22.860 --> 08:24.860
I don't know why they don't do that with

08:25.660 --> 08:27.660
Any of the other games that come out?

08:29.540 --> 08:31.540
Being a little lazy.

08:31.540 --> 08:34.540
I hope we get Gardic with the deluxe treatment

08:35.260 --> 08:37.260
You knew I had to throw that out there

08:37.980 --> 08:42.340
Some of our longtime listeners was getting really sick of some of our little obsessions

08:43.060 --> 08:45.060
Alright, anyhow, um

08:45.580 --> 08:50.980
Toki Tori is a game that is coming to the North American Virtual Console

08:51.140 --> 08:54.020
WiiWare, I guess it's not really Virtual Console, but you know WiiWare

08:54.700 --> 08:57.540
It's a 2d puzzle game and it's going to cost you

08:57.540 --> 09:01.220
1,000 points or 10 bucks. So there you have it

09:02.020 --> 09:07.940
Apparently this game has been fairly well reviewed. It's a little I didn't like it. You didn't like it you played it

09:07.940 --> 09:10.060
Yeah, can you describe it because I don't know much about this game

09:10.060 --> 09:14.880
It looks like I know I look at screenshots and I go it looks a little load runner ish to me sort of you collect

09:14.880 --> 09:18.460
The eggs basically and then that's pretty much it. I mean you can hop around

09:19.100 --> 09:24.700
Jump different platforms with like motion controls and stuff like that. I don't know. It might be cool later on

09:24.700 --> 09:29.780
I didn't give it that much time, but it wasn't something I was interested in it like time bird. I

09:30.740 --> 09:34.100
don't know about that, but yeah, it's it's very basic but

09:36.060 --> 09:38.580
Act F says the sequel could be called Loki Lori

09:40.180 --> 09:42.940
Get it. Yeah. All right, forget it

09:45.300 --> 09:51.980
Well, how about something different sure different Virtual Console whoo at least in UK

09:51.980 --> 09:56.300
um the games out and this time around are

09:57.780 --> 10:05.100
We have hello Pokemon puzzle league. I'm sorry why to say hello. I'm reading for the thing. It says Pokemon puzzle league

10:06.100 --> 10:07.860
has

10:07.860 --> 10:09.860
Come out

10:09.860 --> 10:11.860
there's also a

10:11.860 --> 10:20.460
A summer showdown which is makes me perfectly happy because it's Nina the actual neogeo versions for their neogeo

10:21.820 --> 10:25.260
Virtual console stuff and actually it's going to be out for 900

10:26.380 --> 10:33.460
We points which is a 630. Oh and before I forget to mention a Pokemon puzzle league is a

10:34.460 --> 10:36.460
thousand points

10:36.460 --> 10:39.540
Burning fight is also the other one that's going to

10:39.540 --> 10:47.300
That's out for 800 points, which is sort of like a Streets of Rage type ball or brawler. So there you go

10:49.420 --> 10:52.820
Cool I would download these games if I had room

10:53.580 --> 11:00.140
Yeah, that that does suck. I don't I don't like having to delete stuff to make room room sucks

11:01.420 --> 11:05.700
There's a game coming out in the u.s. Actually that Japan's had for a while now

11:05.700 --> 11:10.380
It's a game called tornado and a lot of you may not be familiar with this game

11:10.380 --> 11:13.620
it's actually very similar to Katamari Damacy and

11:14.220 --> 11:21.980
The game entails you playing a creature that basically becomes a tornado and you have to much like Katamari

11:22.740 --> 11:28.460
Suck up smaller objects and make your tornado bigger, and then you can suck up larger objects and stuff like that

11:28.900 --> 11:30.180
Tasmanian Devil

11:30.180 --> 11:31.940
something like that and

11:31.940 --> 11:36.260
We'll be coming out on the ds in the fall. I want to say

11:36.980 --> 11:38.420
September I

11:38.420 --> 11:39.540
thought

11:39.540 --> 11:41.980
Thought I saw this in September. I could be wrong

11:42.660 --> 11:46.820
But um yeah, it's kind of neat and kind of a little quirky game

11:46.820 --> 11:50.500
They'll be coming out here a little bit later on so keep an eye out for that

11:52.500 --> 11:57.180
Is this something you've actually played? I haven't played it, but I've just seen screenshots and video of it

11:57.180 --> 12:01.900
Hmm could this be the next big thing. I don't think it's gonna be a big thing, but it's a quirky little game, though

12:02.460 --> 12:04.700
Hmm, it'll be like worth checking out at least

12:05.820 --> 12:10.220
All right, well we have another game coming out on the ds

12:10.220 --> 12:12.620
And I don't know if I would necessarily call this a game

12:12.620 --> 12:15.980
But you know Ubisoft had their big press thing this last week, and they announced some of this stuff

12:15.980 --> 12:18.780
We talked about in part a but here's the other interesting thing

12:18.780 --> 12:26.700
They're going to be making a ds game based on Alan Carr's novel the easy way to stop this game

12:26.700 --> 12:30.940
Is to stop smoking and what the game will do this game is coming out in November

12:30.940 --> 12:32.380
What you do you pick a coach?

12:32.380 --> 12:38.220
I guess in this game, and you create a program based on your smoking habit

12:38.220 --> 12:44.780
And basically what the easy way method does is that you educate smokers about how addiction happens?

12:45.740 --> 12:50.060
Convince them that whatever type of you know great feelings you get from smoking

12:50.780 --> 12:55.260
You get from I guess or you can curb that stuff

12:55.260 --> 13:00.300
And you try to stop the emotional dependency, so it's kind of strange though

13:00.300 --> 13:07.180
This is all coming out as a video game, so this is I don't know interesting not really strange for a movie soft

13:07.180 --> 13:13.340
I I want to know though are the rabbits in this because you know you're funny. No. I need to stop smoking

13:15.340 --> 13:20.380
Like yeah, I think it's interesting that the DS is branching out like this so to speak

13:20.380 --> 13:24.540
I mean brain draining is kind of led to you know a lot of these outside-the-box type games

13:24.540 --> 13:28.380
But I'm gonna tell you what I used to be a smoker, and I quit granted

13:28.380 --> 13:33.340
I was not a very heavy smoker, but enough where I was addicted okay in my mind

13:33.340 --> 13:35.500
I I don't know this might be a personal opinion

13:35.500 --> 13:42.460
I'll probably hate mail over this, but the only way you can quit is to when you say I'm going to quit quit

13:42.460 --> 13:44.460
And then do it cold turkey

13:45.340 --> 13:48.440
But it's one of those things where when you say it mean it well

13:48.440 --> 13:51.180
Here's what this, but I don't I didn't have that huge dependency either

13:51.180 --> 13:55.660
You know so maybe that's how I was able to get away with what this game does though is when you have the urge to buy

13:55.820 --> 13:59.460
Cigarettes it gives you different Ubisoft game options that you could purchase

13:59.780 --> 14:05.220
So it's like instead of buying or instead of buying a pack of cigarettes. How about you buy quick yoga or?

14:06.180 --> 14:11.900
Far cry or yeah far cry or how about purchase the my weight loss coach all comes with a pedometer

14:12.420 --> 14:18.860
You know stuff like that. That's how this game is gonna work frisbee says can't wait till alcoholic hero comes out for the TS

14:18.860 --> 14:22.660
What do you think dark soccer? Do you think this will be an effective game? I?

14:23.660 --> 14:26.780
Think that any tool is effective if someone believes in it

14:27.860 --> 14:31.180
it's a lot of it has to do with with willpower and

14:32.180 --> 14:34.060
whatever

14:34.060 --> 14:40.780
And I hate to use this term, but if the crutch works for you, then use it. I mean I

14:41.940 --> 14:46.660
Don't know. I'm kind of iffy about it. Just anyone who says that

14:46.660 --> 14:48.140
anything

14:48.140 --> 14:50.140
is easy is

14:50.500 --> 14:53.380
Usually trying to I mean they are trying to sell you something

14:53.380 --> 14:57.380
It's they're trying to feed you crap when all you need to do is just

14:58.500 --> 15:01.340
Its willpower, and I know not a lot of people have a lot of willpower

15:01.340 --> 15:06.180
And I know that it is a physical addiction. It is a drug and people are addicted to it

15:06.900 --> 15:10.620
However, it's one that withdrawing from will not kill you

15:10.740 --> 15:15.500
You just have to write it out listen has anyone learned anything from Metal Gear

15:15.500 --> 15:17.780
I mean seriously you can eat tree frogs

15:18.300 --> 15:23.100
No, no look at what smoking a pack of cigarettes gives you more time to figure out boss

15:23.180 --> 15:27.320
He has to fight. You know this crazy war you know fight giant mechs up

15:27.320 --> 15:30.680
Do you really want to fight giant mechs? This is what have smokes in his stomach?

15:31.500 --> 15:34.600
You know this is this is why you know I?

15:35.420 --> 15:38.060
Don't know I have nothing, but really this game is stupid

15:38.060 --> 15:44.140
And if you're suckered in the buying it then I'm sure Nintendo has a few other training programs that they can send your way

15:44.140 --> 15:50.040
Including vision training. I'm sure they're going to have hearing training coming up soon poop training poop training

15:51.760 --> 15:54.160
consumer horror training and how

15:55.360 --> 15:58.420
No, and again. I'm going to stick by this

15:59.140 --> 16:04.000
Any anything is possible if you're willing to work for it the end

16:04.660 --> 16:07.080
Anything worth having is worth putting effort into right?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.760
Yeah, it just depends on how much you want it

16:10.760 --> 16:16.740
I might my whole thing is that if you really really really want to quit smoking if you really want to do it

16:17.000 --> 16:19.360
You don't need a game

16:20.040 --> 16:26.480
You'll just do it a game might help, but you don't need it. It's not like heroin. You know where you could you know I?

16:27.240 --> 16:34.000
Guess have a bunch of complications from withdrawal, but if you need to buy a book to tell you how to quit something

16:35.080 --> 16:38.840
That's retarded. I'm sorry it is retarded

16:38.840 --> 16:43.240
Seriously, uh how do I quit something stop doing it?

16:44.280 --> 16:46.280
Do you really need to buy a book for that?

16:47.320 --> 16:49.320
and

16:50.440 --> 16:53.440
What I'm gonna say I'm gonna say this because I I will

16:53.760 --> 16:58.560
Freely admit that there's lots of things that I have kind of poor willpower about you know

16:58.880 --> 17:06.160
But I think that you know if you just sort of say you know nothing changes until you are ready to make it change

17:06.160 --> 17:09.960
Until you are ready to make it change, and then do what you need to do to make it change, right?

17:10.560 --> 17:16.200
So I think that you just have to want it bad enough to put the effort into it if you want it bad enough

17:16.200 --> 17:18.920
You'll do it. That's that's what I think so

17:19.640 --> 17:25.720
Alright, well, we'll see how this game does and what type of floodgates it'll open if it does really well in the meantime

17:25.720 --> 17:30.760
Let's talk about some I have no pity for people who say I can't stop smoking and hold a cigarette in their hand yeah

17:30.760 --> 17:35.760
So you can do it. I wish my mom would quit anyway um

17:37.040 --> 17:43.040
Guess what is coming out in Japan a bunch of stuff including the gardening game poop training

17:44.280 --> 17:49.020
Poop training coming out in Japan. You know they actually have toilet training cartoons

17:49.760 --> 17:55.800
I'm sorry the toilet that sings to you. I'm sorry. I as poop that laughs as it exits the body

17:55.800 --> 18:00.600
I'm really sorry. I asked they're funny though anyway um

18:01.320 --> 18:03.560
They're getting a fatal frame for

18:04.160 --> 18:11.560
If you like your gory ghost games, then that one is definitely going to be the one to go for but it's by Tecmo

18:12.360 --> 18:18.040
Grasshopper manufacturer collaboration put putting this out together and fatal frame for it can be also called

18:19.800 --> 18:24.080
Poltergeist snap poltergeist snap I like that that's a good name for that

18:24.080 --> 18:27.920
I like that, but I'm basically you go around and shoot pictures of dead people the end

18:29.800 --> 18:32.960
Did you character at any point go I see dead people I?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.920
Develop film of dead people

18:36.080 --> 18:38.080
It's only porn if you tape it

18:38.520 --> 18:41.760
They should have they should instead of fatal frame. They should have fatal cam

18:43.040 --> 18:50.280
Were you um like videotape certain places and then have to run it through like a spectral analysis to have everything show up on film

18:50.280 --> 18:55.640
I'm still waiting for what they play calm snap because that uh that that was the picture-taking game

18:55.640 --> 18:57.720
I was looking forward to Rob what?

18:58.640 --> 19:02.080
Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob whoa whoa whoa what okay? I?

19:03.200 --> 19:05.960
Guess it's time for the next story. Yeah, I guess it is

19:06.600 --> 19:13.200
Well, we've been talking quite a bit about Ubisoft this show and we're going to continue talking about Ubisoft in fact

19:13.200 --> 19:15.720
this was yet another game that was shown off at their

19:16.520 --> 19:18.520
Ubi days conference and

19:18.520 --> 19:26.000
This game uses the we balance board, but not how you might think the game is raving Rabbids

19:26.680 --> 19:28.440
TV party and

19:28.440 --> 19:36.440
You sit on the balance board and use your ass to play different minigames nice and Raymond's raving Rabbids

19:38.400 --> 19:43.320
You know they're kind of a party game sort of situation there one of the games

19:43.320 --> 19:51.520
They show that is actually sliding down a hill on looks like an upside-down moose and you are using your ass to you know

19:52.040 --> 19:54.880
Balance yourself as you go down the hill. Oh kind of fun

19:55.480 --> 19:59.080
Moose other options are going to have in the game two or other minigames

19:59.080 --> 20:06.360
They're going to have a dancing minigame where you have to do different things different poses and stuff which will also use the balance board

20:06.360 --> 20:13.240
So it looks kind of neat and of course the raving Rabbids are very funny. This needs to become a sitcom

20:14.040 --> 20:18.920
The Rabbids just an ordinary life kind of like a garfield thing that'd be funny

20:19.480 --> 20:25.040
Should do like Joe's apartment, but with yeah, yeah, I like we're going there. Yeah, exactly

20:26.040 --> 20:29.320
So if it's like garfield will though will will there be a normal ah?

20:30.080 --> 20:33.040
I want to know you know I had to go back and read that again Rob

20:33.040 --> 20:36.560
What garfield minus garfield minus garfield is excellent?

20:36.560 --> 20:43.640
I just and Dan and I had a discussion about this. We've decided that just looking at that either

20:44.800 --> 20:51.840
John Arbuckle, you know the main guy right is either really really really sad or

20:52.480 --> 20:55.880
Mad like Looney Tunes, maybe a little of both I?

20:57.160 --> 20:58.360
Don't know

20:58.360 --> 21:04.260
Well, you know what makes me really really sad and then really really mad is the fact that I can't find we fit anywhere

21:04.260 --> 21:09.480
because the game sold out as fast as it came out and that is not yet back on shelves and

21:09.840 --> 21:17.580
One of those crazy game industry analyst Michael patcher talked to the La times about the we fit supply

21:17.580 --> 21:19.440
And how it's so short

21:19.440 --> 21:24.400
Apparent but it's very interesting what he says is the reason for this it's because of the value of the dollar

21:24.400 --> 21:28.280
Quote the shortage demonstrates one consequence of the weak dollar

21:28.360 --> 21:33.640
We're seeing companies ignore their largest market simply because they can make greater profit elsewhere

21:34.200 --> 21:37.520
They know that Americans will be just as fat a few months from now

21:39.760 --> 21:45.900
Even though there has been about half a million copies of we fit shipped to the us there have already been about 2 million in

21:45.900 --> 21:49.860
Europe kind of interesting those things are going on like really

21:49.860 --> 21:57.140
Crazy prices on eBay like 180 dollars and stuff like that. That's dumb. It's just like we used when they first came out

21:57.860 --> 21:59.140
exactly

21:59.140 --> 22:03.800
Alpha canagram and chat says sky should have pre-ordered it. Here's the thing. I didn't know if the game would be any good

22:03.800 --> 22:06.300
That's a lot of money to drop my game. You don't know that much about

22:07.060 --> 22:13.560
Yeah, I know and then honestly though. I think they're given they kind of blame everything on the weak u.s. Dollar now

22:13.560 --> 22:19.460
Oh, there's George must be the weak u.s. Dollar. I don't really think they put that much thought into it to be honest

22:19.460 --> 22:20.940
I think it's just

22:20.940 --> 22:22.860
They fucked up yet again

22:22.860 --> 22:29.440
And so I mean because what would be the point of releasing like for example Mario Kart there was a shortage

22:29.940 --> 22:33.660
The week it came out, and then there was a lot more later on next week

22:33.860 --> 22:37.500
So you're telling me that the dollar turned around within that week

22:37.500 --> 22:42.500
I somehow doubt that much like I doubt that this that once these

22:43.300 --> 22:47.960
Stores get replenished with more product that oh, it's because the dollar turned around no

22:47.960 --> 22:51.100
I think it's just because they're a retard and poor planning. That's all it is

22:53.620 --> 22:59.980
Akuma JP is one of our listeners in Japan and he says there's fit everywhere here now granted the game has been out a lot longer

22:59.980 --> 23:05.420
There but what I thought was interesting that he said is a lot of used here, so I think it's not that good

23:05.580 --> 23:09.020
So apparently a lot of them are being turned right around in Japan can ship one to me

23:09.420 --> 23:13.540
I'll play it can we play it on the American wheeze though their region watch right I?

23:13.540 --> 23:19.140
Think you can we can get the art didn't they figure that the it's just the weight limit

23:19.140 --> 23:21.420
Let me look at it. Hi. I think they patched the freeloader

23:21.620 --> 23:26.700
Yeah, the freeloader should work now actually remember that homebrew channel that we were talking about last week

23:26.740 --> 23:30.060
they have the gecko freeloader that you can use on there, which is a

23:30.980 --> 23:32.060
basically

23:32.060 --> 23:36.980
Region free player for your Wii games nice and it's homebrew and free

23:37.180 --> 23:40.940
Ssj100 Matt says I can't get my porn it must be the weak us dollar

23:40.940 --> 23:42.860
I

23:42.860 --> 23:44.700
Can't get his porn

23:44.700 --> 23:49.620
You know they say that were the case then we wouldn't be able to buy any games because everyone would be selling them in different

23:49.620 --> 23:55.360
Regions, that's just retarded. You know they say porn is a rescission proof. I don't know we'll see

23:55.940 --> 24:01.380
Crunky boy jr. Says I'm sure Nintendo does this on purpose to create a day and do I mean serious?

24:01.620 --> 24:07.020
This is retarded now. It's they want this to be the big Christmas item, and that's what they're gonna

24:07.020 --> 24:13.340
Do they're gonna make this you know just like the Wii system, and it's gonna be a shortage for like a year and a half

24:13.740 --> 24:15.260
You watch

24:15.260 --> 24:16.940
All right, we'll see all right

24:16.940 --> 24:22.500
Let's see what you the listener have to say you can always email us every week mailbag at orange launch rater calm

24:22.500 --> 24:27.380
And every week dark Sakura picks out a few of her favorite emails and reads them to you in a little segment

24:27.380 --> 24:29.380
We call the olr mailbag

24:29.500 --> 24:35.420
It's a dark Sakura dive in to mailbag orange launch rater calm pull out a few of your favorites and read them

24:35.420 --> 24:37.420
uh

24:37.860 --> 24:39.940
None of them were my favorite so the end

24:41.380 --> 24:43.380
nice try

24:43.580 --> 24:48.700
Okay, this one comes from cheeseburger. I'm finally reading one of your emails, so leave me alone

24:49.980 --> 24:55.100
Hey guys, I'm going to get an Xbox 360 pro soon, and I want some recommendations

24:55.620 --> 25:01.700
Also, I got my first BSOD after playing six hours of Starcraft. I never found out what the problem was dude

25:01.700 --> 25:05.380
You're playing six hours of Starcraft. Oh, we need the

25:06.300 --> 25:11.300
Starcrafts pretty awesome them or your computer's like stop playing Starcraft play something else

25:13.740 --> 25:18.620
It's such a broad question though about the whole like you know Xbox 360 recommendations

25:18.620 --> 25:24.460
What do you like you know it really depends tell us some games that you you do like and that'll be good

25:24.460 --> 25:28.660
I guess otherwise games that everybody seems to like at least if you're listening to this show

25:28.660 --> 25:34.500
I can kind of already tell you probably must like you know the RPG you're not as into like sports games

25:34.500 --> 25:37.360
Let's say we don't talk a lot about those unless it's like tech mobile

25:38.180 --> 25:41.140
But we talk a lot more about RPGs, so if you like RPGs

25:41.140 --> 25:43.920
I think lost odyssey is the best one out there in the u.s.. Right now

25:45.860 --> 25:51.020
I'm not sure rez HD says act F. Which is an awesome music game if you like music based games

25:51.460 --> 25:52.540
That's definitely a good one

25:52.540 --> 25:54.540
I think every extent extra extreme is pretty good

25:54.540 --> 26:01.220
Definitely try to mix it up between the arcade titles and the other stuff because there's some great great titles on Xbox live arcade that

26:01.220 --> 26:06.340
Are worth your time geometry wars is still some of the best $5.00. You'll ever spend Marvel ultimate alliance

26:07.620 --> 26:13.660
But you I still get that on multiple systems, but yeah, yeah, but I still go back and play that all the time

26:14.300 --> 26:18.900
What if you're a racing game fan? What's one of the better racing games on Xbox 360 you think I?

26:18.900 --> 26:23.620
I I still like the last burnout game project

26:24.820 --> 26:28.700
Yeah, it depends. Yeah, I guess a bit. Oh orange box suggests act F

26:28.700 --> 26:32.660
Which is you know definitely portal and other great shooter games if you like first-person shooters

26:33.100 --> 26:37.660
So there's Tiger Claw Samus is not in Marvel ultimate alliance. It's Iron Man

26:38.740 --> 26:43.920
No, it's Samus is in Marvel ultimate or was gonna be a molar ultimate alliance

26:43.920 --> 26:49.100
But got cut out wow for the Wii version that the lever and there has been

26:49.500 --> 26:54.540
Someone found it in the PlayStation 2 version because you know the code that they just you know edit out or whatever

26:56.220 --> 26:58.220
Comment out kind of interesting

26:59.020 --> 27:05.580
This then oh my god. There's a video out there. It's on I think Kotaku ran it. I want to say maybe even joystick

27:06.660 --> 27:10.300
Alright, so there you go. There's some suggestions if you want more

27:10.300 --> 27:14.260
I guess tell us what kind of games you do like and that'll give us some places to start

27:15.660 --> 27:19.900
Anyway next email can I read it can uh-huh of course okay?

27:20.540 --> 27:21.980
this comes from

27:21.980 --> 27:23.380
lichen

27:23.380 --> 27:29.060
Hey, olr. Hi. Hey. I just thought that I would say hi and keep up the good work

27:29.060 --> 27:34.180
I was just wondering if any of you have seen the video of using the Wii with well

27:34.180 --> 27:36.180
And if not I'll send it to you

27:36.180 --> 27:40.100
And he did send a link to it, but I'm not gonna watch it

27:41.020 --> 27:43.020
It said he thinks it's clean like our comments

27:43.020 --> 27:46.180
But why don't we why don't we watch it and comment back on it next week?

27:46.180 --> 27:50.500
I guess so because I've heard of it, but I haven't really watched it so Jamie

27:50.500 --> 27:52.640
It'll be your responsibility to make sure we watch it for next week

27:53.940 --> 27:56.100
Okay, all right. Oh, I have hiccups now

27:57.220 --> 28:00.700
Next email yes, ma'am. Hey, olr. Hey

28:01.220 --> 28:04.020
I've been listening to your awesome show for some time now

28:04.020 --> 28:07.980
And I was just wondering what kinds of places you get your news slash release date really

28:08.940 --> 28:14.480
Release dates from if you can't read it on air. Don't feel like revealing them. It's no big deal. I was just curious

28:14.700 --> 28:20.440
Thanks PS breadsticks are brought to you by this email home of the never-ending Olive Gardens by amplitude

28:22.100 --> 28:24.700
Amplitude we between the three of us

28:24.700 --> 28:29.060
We probably look at like a hundred different gaming news sites and blogs out there on the internet

28:29.060 --> 28:32.020
And I'll tell you a little bit about how it works behind the scenes behind the scenes

28:32.020 --> 28:36.020
We keep a little thread in a private forum that nobody but the hosts and some of the other

28:36.260 --> 28:42.980
Olr people who've worked with us for many years can see and basically when stories are interesting we put them in this post and then

28:42.980 --> 28:44.980
We you know every Sunday

28:45.060 --> 28:50.500
We'll thread them together into what stories are going to cover on the show and usually with few exceptions

28:50.500 --> 28:53.300
I usually thread them together into the big big thing

28:53.300 --> 28:58.240
But I just try to pick I try to pick a flow like pick the we stories put them together the Xbox stories

28:58.240 --> 29:04.220
And you know try to pick big things sometimes I miss things that's why we have last-minute stories and Loki always picks up the crap

29:04.220 --> 29:05.740
That I drop under the table

29:05.740 --> 29:10.380
I will say though where I get my release dates from since it's come up on the show as a question before is that I?

29:10.380 --> 29:15.100
Do actually get my release dates from Eurogamer mm-hmm, which is just great overall

29:15.100 --> 29:20.900
And I get my Japanese release dates from import game stores, so there you go although sometimes. I will use

29:21.420 --> 29:28.220
Just on my own. I will actually use some of the video game retailers in the UK to verify a few dates

29:28.220 --> 29:32.620
But now on the other hand Loki sometimes has insider info on the US release dates

29:32.620 --> 29:35.580
Thanks to you know the stuff that he does so yeah, and then other times

29:35.580 --> 29:37.300
I'm just lazy and read it off a game stop

29:37.300 --> 29:43.360
So there you go nice just depends or Kotaku or now that just wherever has you know whoever has it

29:43.360 --> 29:49.060
I've even pulled crap off CNN and and sadly enough because I am in the game selling business a lot of this

29:49.060 --> 29:52.420
I have on the top of my head too, so I could you know sometimes

29:52.420 --> 29:58.820
I don't even need the release dates gs68 says what is olr a miserable little pile of secrets I?

30:00.500 --> 30:05.040
Want to point out there's other people to contribute to the stories you hear on the show dark Tetsuya

30:05.480 --> 30:11.180
Also posts in our thread and once in a while Travis Donovan and DMN put their head in there when they see something really interesting

30:11.180 --> 30:18.600
So it's not just the three of us that contribute the stories, but just everywhere we have our eyes everywhere like the the

30:19.140 --> 30:20.740
but what the

30:20.740 --> 30:26.900
Terrorist story from the part a is actually um was a link given to me last night by my friend

30:26.900 --> 30:30.040
Who's busy doing a programming test applying for a Namco?

30:31.140 --> 30:34.460
And she's like I'm tired of doing this here look at these links are funny

30:34.460 --> 30:38.100
You never know so I could I get them from people when I did the other week

30:38.100 --> 30:42.980
I actually got from Rama so that was cool alright, so next email

30:44.500 --> 30:48.780
Thank you amplitude, and it's amplitude with the why something amplitude

30:48.780 --> 30:51.820
All right, this comes from Kevin

30:52.740 --> 30:58.720
Tom hi Kevin dramatic music you guys um in the current show talked about Pinna Gogo

30:58.720 --> 31:03.980
Which I've never heard of honestly have to keep that in mind. It's in Dixon, and it's really hot just word of warning

31:04.740 --> 31:08.420
But are any of you going to attend California extreme? Oh hell? Yeah?

31:09.060 --> 31:12.580
It's in San Jose, and you can read all the info at

31:12.580 --> 31:19.100
www.ca expo.com or just California extreme into Google and Firefox URL bar blah blah blah

31:19.780 --> 31:25.020
It'll be my first time going and it would be a kick to see what anyone else thinks of it from their first time

31:25.020 --> 31:27.220
I'm keep up the good work and join the show

31:27.220 --> 31:30.860
I hit the fair by accident and join this show as I'm typing from work ha Kevin

31:30.860 --> 31:33.420
We won't tell your boss Kevin because I do this all the time, too

31:33.420 --> 31:36.820
Um I have never been to California extreme, but I want to go this year

31:37.100 --> 31:40.920
We ran and we actually ran into mela melody there last year

31:40.920 --> 31:45.080
They had a hotel then they live and they live there. I think that's funny, but

31:46.280 --> 31:51.600
Sometimes you want to get away last year in what where everyone knows your name um anyway um I?

31:53.000 --> 31:58.480
Last year was my second California extreme, and it's just a freaking blast um

31:59.280 --> 32:05.320
First of all it's air-conditioned which gives it major major points over Pinna Gogo right then and there um

32:05.320 --> 32:12.480
um it's like you you go up to the desk you pay your money you walk in pinball oh

32:12.960 --> 32:16.720
My God, it's not just pinball too. It's um

32:17.440 --> 32:21.480
It's old classic games like they had the journey game there rob

32:22.320 --> 32:26.960
That's why I'm fucking sold on this I played a full game of space Harrier

32:26.960 --> 32:32.320
I beat space Harrier rob, but it's all in free play right when you get in oh, we're definitely going um

32:32.320 --> 32:36.760
Um definitely going they had um. Oh, God. What else was it they had um?

32:37.280 --> 32:42.740
That game where you slide a pole back and forth and you're sort of like a tug-of-war game were you?

32:42.740 --> 32:46.400
Oh, I thought it was an incredible maze or whatever that no no no no no

32:46.400 --> 32:49.900
It's or you you you have to either run them into or push it from the other side

32:49.900 --> 32:55.320
It's whoever stronger, but you win matches out of it, and I actually um I'd be who did I be I?

32:55.840 --> 33:01.360
Remember who I beat I beat will that was who I beat so look there's your long answer to the short answer yes

33:01.360 --> 33:06.180
We're going there's more we asked for opinions of whoever had their first time and they also

33:06.640 --> 33:12.400
It is an ultra Kade sort of show-off tech place, so they do have ultra pin there

33:12.400 --> 33:18.480
They did last year an ultra pin is a plasma TV the size of a pinball table with

33:19.320 --> 33:22.080
LEDs and everything up in it emulates different tables

33:22.080 --> 33:23.960
And they help like and it's just really cool

33:23.960 --> 33:29.680
And they also have a room with machines for sale, so if you wanted to come a bit of you know a classic joy

33:29.680 --> 33:35.000
You can have a machine for cheap. They had an Alpine racing. They're like who's gonna take that home

33:35.600 --> 33:37.600
Sorry, no one has room for that

33:38.200 --> 33:42.140
But um yeah, um and I'll tell you what if you want to meet up

33:43.120 --> 33:45.120
Because you know I'm definitely gonna go

33:46.800 --> 33:51.240
Shoot another email, and we'll make arrangements for for meeting up. Do they do panels there or anything

33:51.240 --> 33:54.560
I do believe they do panels maybe we ought to look into that all right

33:54.560 --> 33:59.120
We'll have to see all right, but California extreme is just tons of fun tons of fun

33:59.120 --> 34:01.520
Um oh god really long email

34:02.800 --> 34:08.620
Long email is long well email is long, but but but but but but this is from Katamari's forever

34:09.680 --> 34:11.680
So I'm gonna read it

34:11.960 --> 34:13.920
What?

34:13.920 --> 34:19.700
Sorry he's watching that movie while you're reading emails. I know watching something else all right. What is it now?

34:19.700 --> 34:23.600
You gotta tell it porn it's a cat battle, but it's a battle

34:23.600 --> 34:28.720
But that is controlled by a cat and it rides in it and that is the coolest thing ever

34:28.720 --> 34:33.340
Oh my god. I post the link already in chat. Oh my god. Okay. Can I read this okay?

34:35.520 --> 34:40.000
Good evening, olr. I trust you have had a pleasant weekend so far

34:40.560 --> 34:43.160
Anyway, since I didn't write a letter for the past couple of weeks

34:43.160 --> 34:49.640
I wanted to put out it put out a few things out of the open with the school year ending in a couple weeks for

34:49.640 --> 34:56.640
Me and the raging sense of boredom. I feel I'm going to get I decided to stock up on summer games exclamation point

34:56.640 --> 35:01.240
Since the titles coming out in the June July August months are slim pickings

35:01.240 --> 35:07.200
I got more than enough games to hold me over from the a-list Wii titles to lost via Domus

35:09.000 --> 35:12.320
While I live close to the border close to the border to Canada

35:12.320 --> 35:17.640
I frequently shop there and Canadian EV games already has a game days sale out late June

35:17.640 --> 35:23.720
I can't wait for the summer sales here, and I hope I can find a copy of rez ps2 version. I don't have a 360 or

35:23.720 --> 35:26.760
Or excuse me guitar a man for dirt cheap

35:27.920 --> 35:29.480
anything you're looking

35:29.480 --> 35:32.980
Looking forward to playing other than while Ragnarok and GTA 4

35:33.640 --> 35:35.040
I

35:35.040 --> 35:37.040
Want the world ends with you

35:37.040 --> 35:40.420
And I want the Iron Man game. I'm being denied

35:42.240 --> 35:44.240
Guys

35:44.240 --> 35:47.640
Game as we want. Yeah, you're looking forward to playing in the summer

35:48.800 --> 35:50.800
I

35:50.800 --> 35:52.800
Don't know I

35:52.800 --> 35:55.520
Have to be honest sir not a lot. I can think of right now

35:55.520 --> 35:58.160
We fit whenever I can get my hands on it. I think it'll be fun to play

35:59.120 --> 36:02.180
Especially at the little demo. I had the other week, but as far as like games

36:02.180 --> 36:05.280
I'm really looking forward to I can't think we're gonna live in your underwear, huh?

36:05.280 --> 36:08.160
Can hula hoop in your underwear? I just might we should get you some underoos

36:08.720 --> 36:12.240
No, thank you to contain that you looking for anything

36:13.160 --> 36:14.400
I

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
was looking forward to Saints Row 2

36:17.360 --> 36:20.100
but I can't now because

36:20.100 --> 36:26.660
Later news Final Fantasy for DS if that ever comes out. I don't think that's coming out. It is summer. Is it a summer?

36:26.660 --> 36:32.540
Yeah, it's July and the civilization game. So there you go. Okay, I'm looking forward to I

36:33.060 --> 36:38.300
Thought I might be looking for grid. I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick that up. I think the next game I have an order is

36:40.020 --> 36:44.900
Shit it was good to her here on DS, but I don't think I want that anymore. I

36:44.900 --> 36:49.620
I don't know. I may just get like one of those DS

36:50.380 --> 36:56.700
R4s or r6 is or wherever they are now and just homebrew. I might buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith for laughs

36:57.820 --> 37:02.040
Well, I'm going to continue because I don't know please do

37:02.620 --> 37:07.540
What I'm still waiting on. Oh, no, what I'm still waiting for is my Okami covers. Me too. Hi

37:07.540 --> 37:12.820
I ordered one the week of when you said how to get one and I'm still waiting for it a month after

37:12.820 --> 37:16.260
Have you gotten your cover yet? No does and does it look cool probably

37:18.180 --> 37:24.980
I'll find out it looks cool on the website and well after reading some rave reviews and some really odd statistics

37:24.980 --> 37:28.060
I picked up a copy of Grand Theft childhood from my local library

37:28.540 --> 37:32.120
Well, I haven't read a whole lot of it finals week soon have to cram

37:32.120 --> 37:34.120
I have to say I'm quite impressed

37:34.180 --> 37:40.040
They somehow debunk all of the gaming myths such as violence and sex and shed some light on the hot topics

37:40.040 --> 37:43.660
Like what girls actually play and how violent video games reduce stress?

37:43.660 --> 37:49.080
I can't wait to finish it as well as my newly acquired copy of Katamari Damacy. I

37:50.740 --> 37:52.740
have to say I was I

37:53.460 --> 37:59.480
Was a little five-year-old boy again after hearing the news about DDRX and DDR hottest party to last week

37:59.620 --> 38:03.500
Well, I know most of the world has moved on with other lavish music games

38:03.500 --> 38:08.220
I'm still anticipating the release of one of the best franchises Japan has ever given birth to I

38:08.220 --> 38:15.560
Must be the only one in Michigan who cares about this now and speaking of Konami. Are they what Rob you're grabbing the mic?

38:16.100 --> 38:20.220
No, no, is it for support? Yeah, just getting ready in case I think of a witty comment

38:20.220 --> 38:25.740
Okay, speaking of Konami. Are they really serious in releasing rock revolution in its current form?

38:25.740 --> 38:30.420
I mean they should just change the engine to unreal 3-1 and put arrows instead of colored cues

38:30.700 --> 38:34.780
But really Konami and Konami and Bemani should just release a guitar

38:34.780 --> 38:42.420
Slash drum freakish type game and ditch the rock and roll is in vibe that just makes them sing like copycats of their own concept

38:43.700 --> 38:48.840
hopefully the DLC and hottest party 2 will be one unlockable key that unlocks everything and

38:49.220 --> 38:55.320
More for just 200 points or less we could hope but will they probably not three more things?

38:55.940 --> 39:01.740
Thank you for giving us a countdown. How's dr. Mario online? Can you really send we friends a demo?

39:01.740 --> 39:06.660
From what I understand. Yes, and somebody has sent me a demo, but I haven't bought the game myself yet

39:06.660 --> 39:11.020
And we don't get copies because we're not special. So we have to buy them just like you

39:11.700 --> 39:13.860
Rob are you going to penny arcade Expo?

39:15.100 --> 39:21.220
That's the plan. I will know for sure in a couple weeks, but I am planning on going and ferret

39:21.220 --> 39:24.420
Are you really going to be in a horror movie as the slasher that kills everyone?

39:24.420 --> 39:26.620
I think we should let the ferret answer that don't you think I?

39:26.620 --> 39:34.580
I don't think you should give them. Oh you shouldn't give so much plot details away ferrets. You know what ferret?

39:36.300 --> 39:42.060
Okay, that's good enough, baby. I like the other one that made the different noises. I know the wolfie looking one. Yeah

39:42.820 --> 39:44.420
Okay, I

39:44.420 --> 39:46.540
Regret that this letter is very super long

39:46.540 --> 39:49.420
I it's just that I had to say was on my mind

39:49.420 --> 39:55.180
And I really didn't have the time until now until then your favorite email or freeway shuffle into the next DVR iteration

39:55.180 --> 39:57.180
Cottamari is forever PS

39:57.180 --> 40:03.340
This message should be brought to you by the Olive Garden, but instead it's currently asking permission to be endorsed by Bobby black wolf

40:04.380 --> 40:05.580
although as

40:05.580 --> 40:07.580
Cottamari's forever wrote booby

40:09.100 --> 40:16.980
That's time. Maybe that's his cousin. It's a typo all right two more emails. They're little all right. Are they short. Yes, haven't j-rod

40:18.460 --> 40:20.460
Hi guys

40:20.460 --> 40:26.620
Just a quick hi j-rod just a quick comment. I was just listening to episode 279 at work the other day

40:26.620 --> 40:32.820
When Loki started his rant about we fit and how Nintendo is just trying to find any market of soccer moms and people who watch

40:32.820 --> 40:37.340
Oprah by the end of his rant I found myself almost clapping with my headphones on again

40:37.340 --> 40:42.860
Loki echoes my thoughts around the world this email sponsored by the Olive Garden home of never-ending salads and breadsticks

40:43.380 --> 40:45.380
Don't encourage him

40:45.380 --> 40:48.420
I didn't say anything about it. Mommy heart

40:51.260 --> 40:53.260
You know he likes it anyway

40:53.900 --> 40:57.220
I was just wondering if you were going to do a show on a

40:57.700 --> 41:00.740
Saturday on a long weekend like you talked about a while back

41:00.740 --> 41:04.060
Oh, well our goes past midnight where I live and I have to get up at 5 in the morning

41:04.340 --> 41:08.460
The show is comedy gold and I will listen until it is long dead like DTR

41:08.980 --> 41:13.040
Thanks for putting on such a good show week after week, and that's BHK 667

41:13.040 --> 41:16.660
I don't know so much about Saturday, but we did talk about doing a show like around noontime

41:16.740 --> 41:18.940
So we should still make sure that happens at some point

41:20.020 --> 41:25.740
Sometime over the summer you know what we should do although. It would probably kill us what do an all-night marathon

41:25.740 --> 41:27.740
No way my die

41:28.940 --> 41:34.580
I remember what happened when I did a marathon show at you know the tournament we had at scandia

41:34.580 --> 41:35.420
That wasn't fun

41:35.420 --> 41:40.540
Do you run out of things to talk about and it's just now if we if we found something though to keep things interesting like maybe

41:40.540 --> 41:46.300
Rotating out old video classic video games for a night or something there there, or we did it for charity or something

41:46.300 --> 41:51.300
There might be a reason to do it. I don't know maybe Labor Day weekend, but don't hold your breath

41:53.020 --> 41:55.020
Alright, so that's it for emails

41:55.020 --> 42:00.360
Yeah, if you would like to contribute mailbag at orange launch rated comm is the place to go for now more gaming news

42:03.700 --> 42:07.340
So as I kind of hinted what we were talking about games for the summer

42:07.340 --> 42:11.860
Sorry hold on black wolf reminded me Labor Day weekend is the same as packs for some reason

42:11.860 --> 42:16.700
I thought it was a weekend before so what's the next three-day weekend after Labor Day weekend? Maybe Thanksgiving?

42:17.300 --> 42:23.440
That's not a three-day weekend rob four-day weekend. No, it's not support a pre weekend. No, it's not whatever I

42:24.660 --> 42:27.940
Probably won't be here. How about I?

42:28.860 --> 42:30.860
Don't know let's make up our holiday

42:30.860 --> 42:36.660
Seriously, we'll figure something out. We'll make up a holiday olr day. That's it

42:36.660 --> 42:40.440
We have olr day, and we can all take off from work. We'll see we'll see

42:42.260 --> 42:45.820
Anyways say zero two has been delayed to October 14th and

42:48.020 --> 42:51.880
You know because I would imagine that grand theft auto 4 is so awesome

42:51.880 --> 42:57.020
so you know they have to spend the extra time making sure that say zero two doesn't suck and

42:57.020 --> 43:04.780
Apparently they're saying you know of course marketing issues and product quality is the reasons for the oh?

43:06.500 --> 43:13.060
Product quality well, it's just making sure that the game's not so glitchy. You know after all we don't want another musical

43:13.980 --> 43:18.220
Detailing the glitches in the game. Well. I do, but you know no one else does

43:18.900 --> 43:20.380
I don't know

43:20.380 --> 43:24.380
I think it's kind of cool though that they're putting it out so late because I guess me enough time to be done with

43:24.380 --> 43:27.820
Grand theft auto 4 not that I'll ever be done with grand theft auto 4

43:27.820 --> 43:30.520
But you know to the point where I can play another game

43:31.660 --> 43:34.700
All right, in fact. That's what I'm going to do this summer's play games

43:34.700 --> 43:39.460
I already have well while you're waiting for a new game such as Saints Row 2 to come out

43:39.460 --> 43:44.140
There's always Xbox live arcades weekly releases to keep you company and this week

43:44.140 --> 43:49.100
There are two releases and none of them is a rehashed arcade title. That's pretty exciting

43:49.100 --> 43:54.740
Roo goo is one of the titles coming out. It sounds like ragu the pasta sauce

43:54.740 --> 44:01.980
This is just me, but Roo goo is coming out from South Peak, and it's a puzzle game coming out for 800 Microsoft points

44:01.980 --> 44:05.180
That's $10 and apparently it's a four-player game

44:05.180 --> 44:12.340
It doesn't have to be what you do you slide pegs of different shapes into appropriate holes while you're trying to save an alien race

44:12.620 --> 44:14.780
So it sounds like the game perfection

44:14.780 --> 44:20.660
Put a little different that sounds bizarro could be interesting the screenshots definitely look bizarro

44:20.660 --> 44:26.100
They have a very katamari ish vibe to them, but thankfully all Xbox live arcade games come with a demo

44:26.100 --> 44:28.460
So we'll be able to find out and if that's not your cup of tea

44:28.460 --> 44:33.260
Maybe aces of the galaxy will be that is the other game that's going to be coming out unfortunately

44:33.260 --> 44:37.340
We don't know a lot about it. We know it has co-op play and

44:38.140 --> 44:43.900
It's also an 800 point price tag, and it's coming out from our tech and we have a screenshot

44:43.900 --> 44:47.540
So it looks like a space game hence Galaxy, but that's about it

44:48.980 --> 44:51.340
So you'll have to check that out when the demo comes out

44:51.340 --> 44:58.380
But if you've been for whatever reason secretly following aces the galaxy no more information. We do well, then the payoff is this week

44:59.140 --> 45:01.060
There you have it

45:01.060 --> 45:03.060
Hey, y'all hey

45:03.820 --> 45:06.820
Hmm hey hey listen what?

45:09.180 --> 45:11.180
Galaga yes

45:11.180 --> 45:15.660
um there is a listing up for a

45:16.500 --> 45:19.860
Galaga legions for Xbox 360

45:20.380 --> 45:25.580
It's actually put up by the usk which is the German version of the ESRB

45:25.580 --> 45:32.260
And I would so try to pronounce it if I didn't suck completely a German so whatever although actually that did remind me something funny

45:32.260 --> 45:34.260
I found in GTA 4 by the way

45:34.740 --> 45:36.460
But I'll talk about that later

45:36.460 --> 45:38.340
All righty

45:38.340 --> 45:42.260
Okay, they have they have a billboard for something called pass what?

45:43.060 --> 45:46.260
pass was sir piss water, so anyway

45:46.780 --> 45:48.780
That's funny, okay

45:48.980 --> 45:52.900
So um so basically it's it's a shooter. That's about

45:53.620 --> 46:00.980
All we know so but it's Galaga and they're not sprightly. You know in pixely so

46:00.980 --> 46:09.540
Okay, you know what though the weird thing about this is that it makes me think maybe it's an upgrade thing like pac-man vs.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.340
Was or not?

46:11.340 --> 46:16.220
Versus pac-man of wealth I mean that was an upgrade, but you know I'm thinking a pac-man championship edition

46:17.020 --> 46:19.740
Kind of like that although pac-man championship edition is pretty awesome

46:19.740 --> 46:24.340
So they are making a game like that, but out of Galaga that could be kind of cool because I actually like Galaga

46:25.780 --> 46:28.980
So I don't know I like Galaga a whole lot

46:28.980 --> 46:35.140
I actually have a little um charm thing. That's the the ship somewhere

46:36.740 --> 46:40.140
Hmm, I don't know if I care for Galaga that much but

46:41.460 --> 46:46.540
but one game that people seem to care about quite a bit was penny arcade and

46:47.660 --> 46:55.020
The penny arcade game actually penny arcade adventures was the highest grossing Xbox Live arcade debut ever

46:55.580 --> 46:57.580
earning

46:57.580 --> 47:05.660
$20,000 in its first three days, and that's according to of course VG charts the prior record holder was worms HD and

47:06.580 --> 47:14.780
I guess in term of units sold on the rain slick precipice of darkness was the third highest performer of 2008

47:16.380 --> 47:18.380
So that's pretty cool, huh?

47:18.660 --> 47:19.860
Well that good for them

47:19.860 --> 47:23.420
I still have not bought the game, but I think I'm going to because I had a lot of fun with the demo

47:23.420 --> 47:27.620
So we'll see but the penny arcade game good for them

47:27.860 --> 47:29.860
It's a funny game. I know that

47:30.220 --> 47:34.540
Well, I know Loki's going to be very excited about this and this could break records of a different kind

47:34.540 --> 47:37.020
It's not an Xbox live, but virtual console

47:37.500 --> 47:43.540
There's a game. I know that Loki has been begging and pleading for on virtual console for the longest time

47:44.180 --> 47:50.800
Guess what Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars is apparently making its way to

47:51.740 --> 47:52.780
Japan

47:52.780 --> 47:57.140
It's going to be in June. It's made its way to the June release calendar and

47:57.700 --> 48:03.840
You know the games that tend to show up in the Japanese calendar usually end up over here eventually

48:04.620 --> 48:07.100
So there you go one thing though

48:07.900 --> 48:13.620
Nintendo has made the game cost an extra 100 we points just because they know this game will be better so

48:13.780 --> 48:20.240
900 we points for this game there you have it by the way some other games that show up on the Japan's June release list

48:20.240 --> 48:24.480
For the NES Yoshi's cookie, which we already have here

48:25.120 --> 48:27.120
Nekketsu Coco dodgeball boo

48:27.400 --> 48:34.320
For the Sega Master System Rambo for the Genesis Phantasy Star 4 for PC engine which over here was

48:34.640 --> 48:40.920
TurboGrafx-16 power tennis days of Thunder paranoia and blazing lasers and for the neo-geo

48:41.160 --> 48:45.760
Lasers for the neo-geo king of monsters ninja commando and art of fighting too

48:46.360 --> 48:48.360
So do you know the art of fighting?

48:48.360 --> 48:49.440
I

48:49.440 --> 48:51.560
Know there's a character named after me in art of fighting

48:51.560 --> 48:58.000
No, I am I spent like about 30 minutes today reading the Wikipedia article about Dan and in

48:59.640 --> 49:04.640
From the Street Fighter alpha series and how he was a big parody of Rio and

49:07.280 --> 49:09.280
Robert Garcia

49:09.680 --> 49:11.680
Hmm with Yuri's taunts

49:11.760 --> 49:18.080
So interesting, but I know I don't know are you excited about Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console?

49:18.080 --> 49:20.080
Loki or I am pretty excited about it

49:21.720 --> 49:26.200
Just have to wait for it to come out over here. Yeah, we'll be waiting Nintendo. We're sitting here waiting

49:27.040 --> 49:28.640
I'm not

49:28.640 --> 49:35.960
Fine, then why don't you read a story or something? I think I will then guess what else is going to be on the Wii

49:37.080 --> 49:42.720
Beer pong game no you have to guess though cuz I'm not gonna read the story well. I know the answer tech mobile

49:42.720 --> 49:47.720
Oh done the done um not the Virtual Console releases

49:47.720 --> 49:50.560
We've already got but we'll have tech mobile kick off

49:50.880 --> 49:56.320
Which is a new football game that is going to be on the Wii, so it's um

49:57.240 --> 50:00.280
going to be on the Wii and we'll probably use a wiimote and

50:00.920 --> 50:08.840
It's football that's about all that we've got details on but I'm I'm sort of agreeing with this article that it's it's

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
Has the stench of we wear about it

50:11.040 --> 50:16.200
Will it have the awesome halftime cutscenes that the NES version had?

50:16.720 --> 50:23.200
That's what I'm hoping for I believe in the it's going to be on Wii and be about football should cover about everything

50:23.200 --> 50:25.200
I know about that game

50:25.200 --> 50:27.040
fine

50:27.040 --> 50:31.640
Be that way see if I care. I will hey our skype line is going to be open very soon

50:31.640 --> 50:34.860
1 8 7 7 game Olr if you want to get in on the fun

50:34.860 --> 50:40.540
We have a couple more stories to read for you first loki. I was going to say also one thing to

50:42.180 --> 50:45.220
Going back to the tech mobile that is interesting this here

50:45.220 --> 50:51.820
You can customize your team's everything down to the logos to the player stats names, Etc

50:52.380 --> 50:55.220
That's how they're getting around not having license

50:55.940 --> 51:00.140
Because you can make your own team, ha ha nice smart

51:01.140 --> 51:02.860
anyways

51:02.860 --> 51:04.860
something else that's coming to

51:04.980 --> 51:08.760
Consoles well not anytime soon, but eventually

51:09.500 --> 51:15.340
Street fighter 4 and one of the cool things about Street fighter 4 is other than online play

51:15.340 --> 51:18.300
You'll be getting some new characters from the arcade

51:18.980 --> 51:22.460
And two of the characters that they showed concept art for

51:22.980 --> 51:24.980
Faye long and Dan

51:26.700 --> 51:28.700
so that's pretty cool and

51:28.700 --> 51:34.100
uh there's also supposedly more characters Beyond just those two, but

51:35.380 --> 51:37.180
to the start

51:37.180 --> 51:42.860
It's kind of interesting to see that they're adding characters from you know Street fighter turbo and stuff like that plus

51:42.860 --> 51:45.540
It's Dan, and I'm sure that makes Jamie kind of happy

51:45.540 --> 51:46.020
Yeah

51:46.020 --> 51:51.860
this is he cracks me up because I love that his one of his attacks is it translates to

51:52.420 --> 51:54.420
taunting legend and

51:54.420 --> 51:59.420
Shiny fist I love all of his attacks. They're just hilarious

51:59.420 --> 52:03.380
I actually kind of like playing as Faye long and the street fighter super game, so

52:04.060 --> 52:06.580
I'm excited to hear he's in the street fighter for

52:08.260 --> 52:10.260
Sound he always made that's pretty cool

52:12.260 --> 52:13.620
There you go

52:13.620 --> 52:17.740
All right, we'll be checking that out when the street fighter 4 comes out here in America

52:18.460 --> 52:21.600
Hopefully sooner rather than later. We'll see anyhow

52:21.600 --> 52:27.760
Steam I talked about steam earlier when I was talking about audio surf which I was reviewing earlier in the show

52:28.160 --> 52:32.880
Valve has announced that there will be a new edition coming to steam. It's steam cloud

52:33.240 --> 52:36.040
It's the services announced this past week what it's going to do

52:36.040 --> 52:42.280
It's going to store your steam player data online and the cool thing about that is that you can access your save games

52:42.800 --> 52:48.080
Keyboard configurations all the games that you purchase through steam from any computer anywhere

52:48.080 --> 52:51.840
So that was something that was announced for earlier this week

52:52.560 --> 52:57.140
Valve is very committed to PC gaming and saying the PC retail is not doomed

52:57.880 --> 53:04.560
Even though they sometimes have these free weekend games on steam it just in turn supports stronger sales at retail

53:04.560 --> 53:06.560
You know some people just don't want to buy their games online

53:07.320 --> 53:13.520
So we'll have to see how this turns out. It sounds pretty cool in theory doesn't it yeah, so we'll see how that works

53:13.520 --> 53:18.520
Yeah, in theory you never know how that's going to work all right the skype line is now open

53:19.040 --> 53:22.760
1877 game, Olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio

53:22.760 --> 53:27.040
And we're going to go to the skype line right now and take a call hi you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

53:27.920 --> 53:32.400
Hey, all right. It's G68 hi. Hello. Huzzah. What's on your mind, buddy?

53:33.600 --> 53:38.440
Um so california extreme I might I think I'll go check it out

53:38.440 --> 53:42.600
Cool, then we'll see you there, and hopefully we'll be able to do something there although

53:42.600 --> 53:46.760
I don't know if it's last minute or what but we'll do an Olr lunch or something if nothing else

53:46.760 --> 53:48.360
So if I decide to go that

53:48.360 --> 53:52.920
That might throw me what little chance I have to go to comic-con this year. Oh

53:53.880 --> 54:00.920
Decisions decisions comic-con I hear is pretty awesome. I've never been myself, but I mainly go to comic-con mainly because my

54:01.480 --> 54:07.480
My friends from this cosplay group. I was at with Phantom at Phantom made this year gonna be there

54:07.480 --> 54:09.480
This year gonna be there

54:10.040 --> 54:13.480
Here's the thing if we go to california extreme. We're probably only gonna go for the day

54:13.560 --> 54:17.880
I don't know about jamie, but I see it as more of a day trip than a weekend trip personally

54:18.040 --> 54:21.240
I don't think it's something I want to stay the night for i'm actually gonna go for both days. Wow

54:21.960 --> 54:23.320
She's dedicated

54:23.320 --> 54:30.680
So mainly because i'm in the area. Well, santa clara specifically, right? Oh, gosh, it's right in your backyard. Why not? You should go

54:31.480 --> 54:33.160
pretty much

54:33.160 --> 54:38.600
It's like six miles from my house. Oh, well, then you got nothing another word speaking of santa clara

54:38.920 --> 54:40.920
You said you live in santa clara?

54:41.000 --> 54:44.200
Yep, I uh, I might be going to santa clara around the time of my birthday

54:44.280 --> 54:49.960
I'm thinking of taking the day off work to go with uh, my uh boyfriend so we can go ride some rides. So it'd be fun

54:53.800 --> 54:55.080
I've been there

54:55.080 --> 55:00.120
Once this year and I didn't pick up a season pass. Unfortunately, didn't they have a new ride there this year?

55:00.120 --> 55:03.400
Like um firefall, is that new this year? Yeah, I think so

55:04.200 --> 55:06.200
Looks interesting. All right

55:06.360 --> 55:10.840
Anyhow, anything sorry, we're gonna we're gonna announce we got from food chat to amusement park chat

55:10.920 --> 55:13.400
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight? Yeah

55:14.040 --> 55:18.760
What critical thing out of my final report last week swap meet?

55:20.440 --> 55:22.440
Oh, how was the swap meet at fonome?

55:23.400 --> 55:25.080
best deals ever

55:25.080 --> 55:26.440
How so?

55:26.440 --> 55:27.480
like

55:27.480 --> 55:31.560
If you go to kenya for example and buy european CDs like 40 dollars like

55:32.040 --> 55:35.560
This guy over the swap me was selling those for only ten dollars each

55:36.280 --> 55:37.480
nice

55:37.480 --> 55:42.920
Now to get some other games are cheap. I'm contra for for 18 and amplitude for three dollars

55:44.200 --> 55:48.680
I like bargains. That's one thing I missed about going down. Uh, not i'm almost called it out of my expo

55:48.840 --> 55:52.840
one thing I missed about going to fonome this year was uh getting to go to the dealer's room and the

55:52.920 --> 55:54.920
swap me and all that good stuff and trying to uh

55:54.920 --> 55:59.480
Uh, get some good deals on shirts and stuffed animals and other chibi things

56:00.200 --> 56:05.080
uh, I did something cool happen when I was like getting contra for I had a 100 bill and

56:05.720 --> 56:10.440
I offered to get only 80 and change back and to make it for a different to throw in

56:11.320 --> 56:14.680
an ultra mix 3 slash extreme 2 sample cd

56:15.400 --> 56:16.760
Oh, hey

56:16.760 --> 56:17.640
well

56:17.640 --> 56:20.760
Little deals are pretty awesome sometimes so cool. Cool

56:20.760 --> 56:26.040
Yeah, so anyone listening if you go to anime game adventures and don't go to swap meets you're missing out

56:26.280 --> 56:29.080
The swap meets are great. I've looked into lots of good stuff at swap meets

56:29.640 --> 56:31.080
awesome

56:31.080 --> 56:33.480
All right. Well gs60. We gotta let you go take some more calls

56:33.640 --> 56:38.440
But uh, well, it sounds like we'll be running into you at some bay area event in the near future. So take care, buddy

56:38.920 --> 56:40.440
Let's see. Yeah. All right

56:40.440 --> 56:44.920
If you want to give us a call 1 877 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio

56:44.920 --> 56:46.920
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

56:46.920 --> 56:51.960
Hey, what's up, guys? It's toshin. Hello toshin. What's on your mind my friend. Uh, not much

56:52.360 --> 56:56.920
Uh, I wanted to know rob if you've got picked up super budge dodgeball for the ds this week

56:57.480 --> 56:59.480
No, I forgot it came out. Did you get it?

57:00.040 --> 57:04.520
Yeah, I actually uh, I played my friend's copy loaned it to me. It's pretty fun. Oh my god

57:04.680 --> 57:07.480
Tell us about this game. Is it is it faithful to the original or what?

57:08.040 --> 57:13.640
I would say it's pretty faithful. Um, I only got to play like a multiplayer brawl, but I mean you can

57:13.640 --> 57:19.800
Apparently level up like your players and there's like 14 or 15 different like teams you can pick

57:20.520 --> 57:26.360
And like your super shots are apparently picked on your birth date that you enter in the q the whenever they ask you for it

57:26.600 --> 57:28.600
Huh? That's kind of interesting

57:28.920 --> 57:32.200
yeah, so I don't know all the combinations of like the super shots, but

57:33.000 --> 57:33.880
Oh

57:33.880 --> 57:36.280
My friends is pretty cool. It's kind of like the one where

57:37.080 --> 57:41.880
You know when you run and it was like one of the slider ones like it was back and forth like a vertical ball, right?

57:41.880 --> 57:45.080
He he had that one set up which was kind of cool. Huh? I didn't

57:46.280 --> 57:51.320
But eight man brawl. Oh, that's really fun. Oh my gosh, this game sounds pretty awesome already

57:51.320 --> 57:55.320
Can you play it over wife? Uh, can you play over internet wi-fi or is it just local wi-fi?

57:55.480 --> 58:02.120
It's it's it's just a single card multiplayer on full trip. Fortunately, it's that's the only downfall I was like this has to have wi-fi

58:02.680 --> 58:07.400
No, at least it's got the single or you only have to have one card to play multiplayer. That's kind of nice, I guess

58:07.400 --> 58:14.200
Yeah, it's awesome. So cool. Well, I think for the reminder they came out. I gotta go get it. Oh, you have to get it. Hmm

58:15.000 --> 58:16.360
All right

58:16.360 --> 58:20.040
Very cool. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight? Any other games you've been playing or what have you?

58:20.600 --> 58:24.920
Uh, I haven't been playing a lot because i've been working a lot, but you know

58:25.560 --> 58:29.880

Thank you. Thanks for the reminder about that ds

58:58.440 --> 59:01.720
Super dodgeball ds. I had no idea what's coming out. Hey, the phone's ringing off the hook tonight

59:01.720 --> 59:04.280
We're already into another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

59:05.400 --> 59:10.680
Yo, this jammer jay. Hello jammer jay. What's on your mind? I don't believe i've heard you call before have you called before?

59:11.320 --> 59:15.160
Um, I haven't called before. Oh, well then hello first time caller. What's on your mind?

59:16.040 --> 59:19.800
Nothing. That was one. Um, hold on a second. I'm getting a little lag. That's all right. It happens

59:20.120 --> 59:23.800
You got to shut down the porn torrents when you're listening. No, i'm just kidding. Yeah, okay

59:24.360 --> 59:29.560
I was curious on um, oh, I don't usually have those running about now. I was curious. What uh, um,

59:29.560 --> 59:32.120
What is the farthest you guys have ever traveled just to play?

59:32.840 --> 59:36.760
Ddr like a road trip just to solely played an arcade version of ddr

59:37.080 --> 59:42.520
Oh good question farthest we've ever traveled to solely play an arcade version of ddr

59:42.680 --> 59:45.960
Loki do you have any uh answer for this? Well, it's pretty much just like three hours

59:45.960 --> 59:52.200
I think we've been driving drove from here to like san jose or milpitas to play like some japanese

59:52.840 --> 59:56.040
stuff there. I remember also we drove to stockton golf land to play, uh

59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.160
Extreme I was max 2 when it first came out. Yeah max 2 when it first came out. They only had a stockton golf land

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.920
Uh, well, here's the thing do like tournaments count because we drove all the way to san diego once to go to a tournament

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.240
At rays and san diego is like a 10-hour drive from here

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.640
So that was pretty that's like one of the farthest I can think of or if you guys drove to like, uh, was it um,

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.000
The japanese arcades arcade infinity. I was thinking I don't I didn't drive all this way to play ddr

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.120
But I have driven that whole way to play beatmania 2dx would be

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.600
Arcade infinity, which is in la which is about uh, six and a half hour drive from here

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.600
So, how about you? How much the furthest you've ever driven think about six hours, but sometimes when I um

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.080
Go on trips. I make it a highlight to hit up any ddr in the area. So I think

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.720
Maybe like 10 hours

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:46.520
See that would that's kind of similar to something that's being mentioned in chat right now is this is j100

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.360
Matt is saying rob did go to new jersey to go to a ddr tournament and that's true

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:57.560
I happened to be in um allentown pennsylvania the exact same weekend that a ddr tournament was going on at eight in the break

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.160
Or was it in the groove? I think it was both

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.240
Um, and so I actually drove over to eight on the break in new jersey

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.480
Which is about a 90-minute drive just check out this tournament and see what the east coast scene was like because you know

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.000
There's a whole that east coast versus west coast

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.920
Although I didn't know anybody I really felt kind of like a fish out of water just because I was like a stranger and I

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.000
Wasn't really participating or anything and nobody really knew me over there. So I was like, oh my god

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.680
He really knew me over there. So it was um, you know, but I had a good time. It doesn't mean I didn't have a good time

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.080
What's that i've been to a ddr tournament in beluxy when I went back to visit

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.840
I know I know you were out for a moment when the caller first called in but he was wondering what's the furthest you've ever

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.960
Gone just to play ddr just to play ddr. Yeah

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:44.520
And I was I was saying okay beatmania 2dx at least there's been arcade infinity, but that's close actually

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.080
I went to san diego

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.360
to um

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:54.600
Well, I was going to san diego anyway, but one of the things I intended on doing was playing. Um

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.640
The uh, ddr max when it was new

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.280
That's right because rays was like the first place anywhere that had that huh and I went and played it

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.480
And that's when I realized that doing um that the hold arrows hurt really bad

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.760
Because i've got a little bit of a weakness in my ankles. So

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.200
But um other than that though the farthest distance i've traveled and then played ddr

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.520
Was um going back to alabama

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.000
From here. Okay, that's that's cool. Was that um, beluxy tournament at boomtown?

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.120
I do believe it was it was a few years ago. It was, you know, definitely before katrina

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.720
Um, and it was when we had a max they were just getting a fifth mix

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.200
Okay, yeah, I think I remember that because my buddy was working at that arcade there in boomtown

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.560
Wow, it wasn't boomtown now that I think about it because it was that the arcade was sort of off to the side

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:50.120
If I remember correctly and and it was a shiny brand new machine and I got up there and I think I played um

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120
Why didn't I play superstar?

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.160
Because that was no it wasn't that it was when I was I had this thing about doing um

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.880
What was it that I used to always play? Um in hidden?

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.480
I don't remember I used to play I would only play the song hidden. Anyway, I don't remember but that's how how long ago that was

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.440
But yeah, it's a small world me and dark sakura are from the same part of the u.s

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.000
Oh, yeah, there you go. Next next time I next time I go hit up the home front, you know

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.200
Ddr. Well, not i'm not down there though. I'm in idaho. Oh, i'm sorry

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.000
Hey, but there's a um within two hours is supernova 2 arcade. So that's not too bad. That's sweet. That's cool

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.640
Yeah, apparently there's a supernova 2 in roseville, but i've yet to play it. You know, i'm just I I

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.000
I love being from the south, but I don't miss living there

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.480
It's a place you want to visit once in a while I don't ever go visit in the summer ever I made that

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.900
Yeah, I like it in the summer down there humidity

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.320
Really quick question for you jammer jay, and then we're gonna let you go

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:57.400
But um, do you think that the ddr home versions have kind of killed that whole desire to drive out and uh, go play other types

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.760
of ddr

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.200
I don't know the um reason i'll play the home versions that much as I don't up here

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.720
I don't have a good since I live in an apartment complex. I can't use my cobalt flux

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.480
It depends on what you play at at home on the actual platforms

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.720
I had that problem when I lived with extra furs that we lived upstairs and when I played ddr

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.440
It wasn't fun for the downstairs people so I couldn't do that

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.840
so

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.680
Yeah, but other than that like some people in the home version they have just as much fun on it

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.280
But I would need to really play in the arcade because I hit pretty hard on the pads, huh?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.040
All right. All right. Well jammer jay, we gotta let you go to get some more calls

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.800
So thanks for the call and uh, I hope you call in again sometime. We like cool. Thanks

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800
Peace out and triple a peace out

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520
Peace out. All right

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:44.360
What was the other thing you said in triple a oh like car insurance? Yeah, I guess so or maybe you know high score

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760
ddr triple a

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800
Where you make the machine go oh

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.080
One more call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.360
Hey, hey, hey, it's ronma. God. You always get through you got the miracle dialing finger. That's all right

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.360
We like you at least what's on your mind?

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:08.200
Not too much. I'm recovering from wizard world philly which was this weekend from what wizard world wizard. Oh, really? How is that?

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:15.400
Want me to be honest, yes, of course it sucked why did suck

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.000
As much as they really said this would be a big comic book convention

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.600
I could tell you look like no more than ten thousand people showed up at least it was just quiet

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.680
You know, it was just like bleh, you know, I don't know ten thousand sounds like a lot to me

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.680
I mean, it's no comic-con but still

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.600
Plus, um, the tournaments were kind of crappy too. That's too bad

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:47.320
So what is it really pissed me up is the fact that somebody was there selling roms and emulate emulators and roms for

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.800
Between 30 and 50 bucks. Oh

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.160
That's that you can get really busted for that. I mean, it's kind of illegal to begin with but when you're selling it for profit

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.840
That's when they really go all out of the way to get you. You gotta be careful

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.120
Turn them in the funny thing is with hmm. I said turn them in

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.560
Well, there's already someone going around doing that but at the comic conventions

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:13.480
They really bust you more for selling bootleg tv shows and movies and stuff like that. It's really sad when you see

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120
like your favorite tv show

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.280
At the con for sale the entire first season for like 40 bucks where you can go to best buy and get it with a better

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.600
Quality, um cover for like 20

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.720
hmm

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.720
All right, well interesting, um, would you tell me a little more about this con

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.640
It was comics and games and like anime and like all that all rolled into one

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:44.440
Something like there's more comic books than they add in a touch of science fiction and anime. Um, kind of like

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.680
Because that's what comic-con does. I mean comic-con is supposed to be about comic books

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:54.280
But hello, like, you know, the battle star galactica people show up every year and so, you know turn into this big big thing. So

01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:00.760
Well, even with starbuck being there still wasn't all that big big big thing. Ah, too bad starbuck was there

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.680
Yeah, my roommate was online for two hours to get her autograph. Nice

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.400
Good times. I've actually I finally been catching up on battle star galactica. I'm in the third season right now. So good times

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:17.160
I'm yeah overall. I don't think we're going back next year. Oh, that's too bad. Well, there you go

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.280
Oh

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.520

He's like, yeah turn-based rpgs suck and I me my roommate look at him

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.600
Which is coming out june 19th there then they've got band brothers dx, which is coming out on the ds

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.480
That's june 26. Then july 10th is resident evil zero

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.920
From capcom july 24th is wario land shake on the wii

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.560
which is going to be kind of like a

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.280
Super paper mario type game all sides scrolling but um using we

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.520
Motion controls and stuff like that. All right about that sounds kind of interesting

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.200
july 31st fatal frame 4 the mask of the lunar eclipse

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.600
And also on the 31st rhythm tengoku gold

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.520
Another rhythm music game and fire emblem ds in on august

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:35.000
Seventh and uh, they had a little they have a screenshot or not really well a scan I guess

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.680
Of some of the stuff for wario land shake. It looks pretty cool. That's just like a platforming game and stuff

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:46.840
That's just like a platforming game and stuff. Um, let's see here also, um

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.480
There's um a new tournament going on for mario kart wii this one's a little different

01:11:53.560 --> 01:12:00.040
It's not just like a race and times and stuff like that. You're actually doing a boss battle and you're battling. Um,

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.680
The uh spiky top man from um, super mario galaxy

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.600
so that's kind of neat that they actually have almost kind of like download content for this game that you're um,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.200
Fighting a new boss or something

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.120
I don't know why they include something like this in the game like maybe a story mode or something like that

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.040
But at the very least though, um, you can check it out for free

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.280
and um

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.320
the

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:28.440
Exclusive tournament and content ends june 9th. So if you want to check that out

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.520
Do it now

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.880
um

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.320
Let's see here

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.320
Apparently there's a that game next week grid that's coming out

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.040
Um, it's the xbox 360 version is apparently freezing up on people

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.680
uh-oh, so, um

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.400
Oh code masters is rushing to fix the game already, which I believe has been released in the uk already

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.920
But uh, you know, we'll be coming out soon maybe a day one patch or something like that. Um

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:03.720
Um, they say no, we're getting close through the problem and we're fixing or we will be including a fix and a backup work around option

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.600
Just in case in our forthcoming patch due within the next few weeks or sooner

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.160
Uh, we think the issue is due to a specific

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:17.640
Um drive hardware and possibly with uh bad blocks or sectors on your hard drive. So

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.520
interesting

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.520
Um, let's see here

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:28.300
Let's see here apparently nintendo of america has 100 we aware titles in development

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.480
I wonder how many of those are going to be crap

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.360
So that's interesting

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.520
And um, let's see here

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.960
There's some mobile games have been selling pretty well

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.500
Uh sonic mobile has hit 8 million downloads

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.960
Which is pretty amazing for a mobile game and guitar hero 3 mobile has made a 1 million

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.460
downloads, so that's kind of cool

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:59.660
Um, if you're interested in watching some original content from g4 or stuff that they used to have on their station

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.220
Um, you can check out

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.340
both

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:08.860
I think they have episodes of xplay on there now or attack of the show and stuff like that as well as

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.420
code monkeys

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.420
and I want to say there was a

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:20.780
Uh this block I guess which is um a snowboard documentary series that never really uh

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.580
debuted on the network

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:30.300
Huh, you know why they don't just put this stuff on their own network instead of I don't know cops marathons and cheaters

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.700
it's beyond me but

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.140
Who knows?

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.140
all right, and uh

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.380
That is pretty much it, all right

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.380
All right. Well that's gonna bring us to a close of another week of orange lounge radio

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.220
But not until we go around and get everybody's final thought loki your final thought tonight

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.060
Uh, my final thought is i'm gonna go cook some salmon

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.940
Uh, my final thought is I want to go eat some salmon, uh dark sakura

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.460
I like fire

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:03.420

It's just this really easy plot

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:21.980
It's like a pyramid scheme

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.940
But you don't have to pay for it because it is free here at orange lounge radio

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.340
