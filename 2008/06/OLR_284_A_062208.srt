1
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:26,560
[SPEAKER_00]: The PSP gets new 4.0 firmware, the ESRB makes plans to stop early game announcements, and we celebrate six years of Orange Lounge Radio being on the air.

2
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:41,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there once again and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio for the 284th time in a row, if you've been a long time listener.

3
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:47,653
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next three hours to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:51,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:52,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

6
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:53,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

7
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:54,218
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

8
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

9
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:56,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it's all good.

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all good?

12
00:00:58,841 --> 00:00:58,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

13
00:00:58,981 --> 00:00:59,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good at Camp Jamie.

14
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recovering from my milkshake.

15
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:04,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Did your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?

16
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:05,985
[SPEAKER_01]: It brought something.

17
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:06,786
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

18
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It brought gas.

19
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to, as well, Tech Master... You're so gross.

20
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello, as well, to Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,039
[SPEAKER_04]: How would a milkshake bring you gas?

22
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

23
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the first thing my toilet brain went to.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,840
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I, too, finished a milkshake.

26
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:26,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

27
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:31,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and got my... Because I went and stopped by Burger King, and I got a large milkshake and a large soda.

28
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did it bring you?

29
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:34,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooling.

30
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:35,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooling?

31
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:35,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

32
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not so hot anymore.

33
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you seriously freaking cold?

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

35
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:54,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me introduce, since Loki's already yelling at somebody, he has not been on our show in quite some time.

36
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:55,754
[SPEAKER_04]: About a year.

37
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a year is quite some time.

38
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just quantifying it.

39
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but Miklatov is here tonight.

40
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:02,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

41
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:06,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And Miklatov ran away from our program to go be in Kansas for a little while, right?

42
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:07,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

43
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and he walked into the studio tonight wearing a blanket.

44
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it feels cozy after you eat a lot of food.

45
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,001
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, I'm just going to relax.

46
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:20,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to point out it's over 100 degrees outside here in lovely Sacramento, California.

47
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,004
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a nice blanket.

48
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not heavy, so it feels fine.

49
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying it's like it's 100 degrees outside.

50
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:27,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

51
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had to have the lights off before the show to keep it cool in here.

52
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like two fans going.

53
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:32,730
[SPEAKER_04]: The door opened to the house.

54
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we might return the lights off.

55
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw Justin TV.

56
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:37,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a video show.

57
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a shirt underneath.

58
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,381
[SPEAKER_02]: and Shorts.

59
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And now a blanket.

60
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:45,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And a blanket.

61
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And why, just because it feels nice.

62
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:54,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's, yeah, if you eat a lot of food and then you're like, oh, I'm so stuffed and you don't want to move, it always feels better to just have something to kind of wrap yourself up in.

63
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you were the food and this is your shell.

64
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a tostada or something.

65
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:00,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

66
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:02,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us what you've been up to for the past year.

67
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:03,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting?

68
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

69
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:06,995
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

70
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

71
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost got hit by a tornado.

72
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:09,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

73
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:13,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of cool.

74
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:20,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It interrupted WoW and it wasn't very fun because I had to stop playing WoW for a minute to check on the tornado.

75
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still in touch?

76
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to work at the Konami building but then they don't have their offices here in NorCal.

77
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you can or can't say about the past or the future.

78
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working for them as an independent contractor.

79
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:34,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

80
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:35,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about anything?

81
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:36,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not, huh?

82
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:39,234
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's whatever I always do.

83
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:39,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

84
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:42,375
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing stuff.

85
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

86
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, those lights went off.

87
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:48,620
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's change the topic and talk about our gaming weeks.

88
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:54,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We always like to start the show off talking about what we've been playing in our weeks, and we'll start it off, ladies first.

89
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:56,226
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

90
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Ragnarok and Pinball, as usual.

91
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still waiting for Dan to bring me back The World Ends With You, so I have no idea what's going on.

92
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:08,836
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

93
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:10,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

94
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:11,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

95
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:25,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I got an R4 this week, so I was playing some DS games, and I tried playing, um, what was it, uh, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan, but that game is boring.

96
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely boring, since it's all in Japanese and I can't read any of it.

97
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, seriously, when am I gonna get to the boot poking, okay?

98
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, yeah, just, it's, uh, One Trick Pony, it seems like.

99
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:39,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, uh,

100
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried a bit of Band Brothers, which is actually pretty neat.

101
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:50,938
[SPEAKER_05]: A little difficult to figure out how to play it though, but still pretty cool music game.

102
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be nice to see that brought over here.

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Then also played Jump Ultra Superstars, which...

104
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess people compare it to Smash Bros.

105
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:02,686
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit.

106
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say it's quite like Smash Bros.

107
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:14,950
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of characters in it for sure, and I like how you can combine different pieces of artwork and stuff to allow you to switch characters and add abilities and stuff like that.

108
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd say it's more like Marvel vs. Capcom or something like that, which is pretty cool.

109
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:23,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And then played a little bit of that still live game.

110
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:28,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's pretty much very similar to the Flash Portal game.

111
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,921
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've played that, you pretty much have played this game as well.

112
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:38,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And Point Blank DS, because I was trying to find that everywhere and no one sold it.

113
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just kind of gave up on it.

114
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:46,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Point Blank DS is pretty much just like Point Blank without a gun and just using the stylus.

115
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:47,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, it's pretty fun.

116
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So too bad that that didn't do very well.

117
00:05:51,975 --> 00:06:03,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course on top of all that stuff I was playing Grand Theft Auto 4 Because that's fun So what does this device do, this R4 for those that don't know?

118
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:14,692
[SPEAKER_05]: It allows you to run homebrew on your DS and also you can run ROMs as well for DS games Basically it uses a micro SD card and you can throw stuff on there

119
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:22,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good for playing import stuff, especially if you're just looking to try out a game and don't actually plan on buying it.

120
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:26,135
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is this?

121
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:33,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I was waiting for the singing to start.

122
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo-ho, yo-ho, Pirate's Life for me.

123
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:37,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad joke.

124
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to cue up your jokes next time.

125
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:41,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible, I know.

126
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what would have been better.

127
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to know after six years, things still don't work right on this program.

128
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I was working on some other things.

129
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted a video on GameTrailers.

130
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:05,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean to post it on the YouTube community we have, but I forgot how to.

131
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:07,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's like the easiest thing in the world.

132
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the easiest thing in the world, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, okay?

133
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us a little bit, because this is kind of exciting, because Orange Lounge Radio hasn't done anything video related.

134
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we don't really count Justin TV.

135
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:22,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no offense to Justin TV people, but this is just a camera pointed at people doing a radio show.

136
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:24,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not that exciting, but you wanted it, so hey.

137
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:30,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the first real video thing we've done in a long time.

138
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us a little more about what you did.

139
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually finally got my video set up working at home because I've been trying forever to get my damn capture card to work and be able to play something at the same time.

140
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:41,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

141
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:16,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when he describes it, it doesn't sound that exciting, but I actually watched the video, and I'm not even that big a Grand Theft Auto person.

142
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:20,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a good game and all, but I just don't get into those types of games as much as everyone else.

143
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:21,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of laughed.

144
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.

145
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It was well done.

146
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:26,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It fit the music so well.

147
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:26,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

148
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.

149
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:30,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent long hours trying to get it to go with the music.

150
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Making video is a bitch.

151
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:37,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done video for an online game that Shane and I are involved with and it's a pain in the ass.

152
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me like all night to do like a two and a half minute video.

153
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:46,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a three minute video and I started with like four hours of video and I cut it down to three minutes.

154
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:48,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet the wife loves it.

155
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, she loves the fact that I'm sitting there doing all that stuff.

156
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely loves it.

157
00:08:55,819 --> 00:09:05,161
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and then, yeah, then after I finished that, then I started working on something else, which I was hoping to have done today, but it's not, so you'll have to wait.

158
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us any hints?

159
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

160
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:12,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say something.

161
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:18,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that people have been asking for for a long, long time, Loki is making happen.

162
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

163
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say that.

164
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:20,924
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

165
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:22,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so much for your gaming week.

166
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:23,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

167
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:26,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why is the Unabomber at our window?

168
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,759
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks like it's Andrew, not the Unabomber.

169
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's Andrew.

170
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go next.

171
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:34,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know he was coming.

172
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go next to talk about my gaming week.

173
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:38,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it's the Unabomber.

174
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you?

175
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Get him on a mic somehow.

176
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we don't have the... The fourth mic's not hooked up now.

177
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:45,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know you were coming.

178
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

179
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't miss it for the world.

180
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is the kind of gems that Justin... See, Justin TV?

181
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,043
[SPEAKER_04]: He does kind of look like the Unabomber.

182
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:52,304
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

183
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:54,165
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

184
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew, welcome to the show tonight.

185
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:57,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not much.

186
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:00,090
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get that mic, like, right there.

187
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now working right.

188
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:02,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crazy mic.

189
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:07,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You're here to celebrate our sixth birthday with us, I'm sure.

190
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:07,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

191
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And your own anniversary is tomorrow, as in your birthday.

192
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:11,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

193
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:12,536
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are you going to be tomorrow?

194
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:13,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Appropriately, I'm going to be 23.

195
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

196
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:20,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, there's that number of coincidence again that got brought up on Bobby's show earlier.

197
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:20,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

198
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,262
[SPEAKER_04]: That means you were 17 when this show started?

199
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:25,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I was.

200
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:25,983
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I'm old.

201
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:27,603
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I am old.

202
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:27,903
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

203
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:30,409
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week

204
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Night of Cydonia Night of Cydonia

205
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:35,724
[SPEAKER_04]: because you would think like rock band's kind of the better game and in a lot of ways it is but um since I don't really like to play drums and I'm not going to sing in my house like especially when nobody's around it's not like a party where I can use alcohol as an excuse um it's I don't know there's nothing to play but guitar and I kind of like the guitar parts and Guitar Hero better than I do rock band.

206
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:44,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock band gets kind of boring because I don't know it's a little closer to the real thing or something I don't know but um Guitar Hero gets all crazy and I like that so um

207
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapid Slasher in chat room.

208
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:50,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com agrees.

209
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:52,671
[SPEAKER_04]: That section on Cydonia is tough.

210
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:53,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It is tough.

211
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:54,593
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

212
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheeseburger in chat says, Hey Rob, I was 7 when the show started.

213
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's 13 now.

214
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

215
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm old.

216
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Joshi...

217
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he was actually listening when he was seven.

218
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:09,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he'd just say he happened to be seven.

219
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Joshi16 in chat says Guitar Hero is more fun alone.

220
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of agree.

221
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero may not be the better party game, but it's more fun to play by yourself.

222
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So, go figure.

223
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:28,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in my gaming week, I bought Space Invaders Extreme for the PSP because I had played a little bit when Loki had it over here.

224
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:29,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, whatever.

225
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

226
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:01,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, not only is it flashy with the graphics in the background, but the invaders come in little colors.

227
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have some red ones, some green ones, and some blue ones.

228
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:06,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you shoot four blue ones in a row, you get one type of weapon.

229
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,002
[SPEAKER_04]: You shoot red ones in a row, you get another, and so on.

230
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:12,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of like a challenge-y element to it if you want the good weapons.

231
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:16,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a cross between Space Invaders and Raven.

232
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess, yeah.

233
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of different.

234
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:28,079
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only thing that kind of disappointed me, now granted, I haven't played the game a whole lot or gotten very far, so it's probably not fair for me to say a whole lot about it right now.

235
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I've played far enough where I've started to notice this.

236
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't notice a lot really change from level to level.

237
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:36,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, the aliens get smarter.

238
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:38,243
[SPEAKER_04]: You start to fight these, like, massive aliens.

239
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:40,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the coolest things, I think, in the game is the bosses.

240
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they actually have boss aliens they have to fight, which is kind of cool.

241
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:44,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, then you have little miniature aliens.

242
00:13:45,146 --> 00:14:13,655
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's still always blue, red, green aliens and the same weapon upgrades that you had in level 1 so I was just kind of hoping maybe some of that would change and upgrade as the game goes on if it does, I haven't gotten there yet and I've gotten to the point where it's starting to feel a little stale so, you know you know, because the original Space Invaders was all white or green aliens it's been 30 fucking years since the original Space Invaders it ain't broke well, but would you spend $20 to buy the original Space Invaders

243
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:15,922
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

244
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:40,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, were you trying to break it?

245
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:52,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, okay, I take a little bit of it back because I've even found myself on GameTap going back to old Atari 2600 games that were boring years ago, like Kaboom, and I freaking played Kaboom for like an hour and a half just a couple weeks ago.

246
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I could see that.

247
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:58,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to break my old record, though.

248
00:14:58,571 --> 00:14:59,952
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's face it, we're a little weird.

249
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the King of Kong.

250
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the guy play Crystal Castles with his feet.

251
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:08,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

252
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I want to ask you, do you have any interest in newer Space Invaders?

253
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it like, oh no, this is bastardizing a classic?

254
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:15,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I would try it.

255
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:18,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm open to anything.

256
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:21,298
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Frogger made me want to throw up, but I'll give Space Invaders a try.

257
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,458
[SPEAKER_04]: The one on Xbox Live?

258
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:22,518
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

259
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:23,298
[SPEAKER_01]: That Frogger 2?

260
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

261
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,379
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, the old new Frogger.

262
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:26,340
[SPEAKER_01]: The old new Frogger.

263
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

264
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,220
[SPEAKER_03]: The wannabe 3D Frogger.

265
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me want to throw up.

266
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:29,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

267
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:33,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, by the way.

268
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The revamped version.

269
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:38,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was based on PlayStation 2.

270
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:39,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's an original game.

271
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:43,979
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a frog or two, though.

272
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cute, you want to throw up in your mouth.

273
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But the little hoppy noise gets really irritating.

274
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,361
[SPEAKER_04]: But I only played the demo.

275
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't actually buy the full game.

276
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

277
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Invaders, which is pretty cool.

278
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:58,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for $20, it's pretty hard to beat.

279
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good-priced game.

280
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:05,085
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP games are not games you usually... I mean, unless you're playing Crisis Core or something.

281
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:07,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Not something you spend hours and hours and hours doing.

282
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer playing the PSP while I'm...

283
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:10,528
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,135
[SPEAKER_05]: DOOMISSION, FIGHT PEOPLE, GO BACK TO THE HUB

285
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I gotta go to chat room because they're talking a lot about Space Invaders here.

286
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:10,712
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, from Wikipedia, Space Invaders was a very popular video game that influenced the video game industry.

287
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,854
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan, specialty arcades opened with nothing but Space Invaders cabinets.

288
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:17,435
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is considered one of the most successful arcade shooting games.

289
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that people went crazy about the game in Japan.

290
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:23,037
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that.

291
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,658
[SPEAKER_04]: It was much bigger over there than it was over here.

292
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:28,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitsune in chat says, you see Space Invaders everywhere here.

293
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,984
[SPEAKER_04]: They even have Space Invaders plushies in the arcade that you can win.

294
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,126
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be kind of cute, actually.

295
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:35,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Space Invader cell phone charm for a while.

296
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:41,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the original Space Invaders can be kind of boring, continues Kitsune in our chat room, but I played a newer version.

297
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.

298
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I enjoyed Space Invaders Extreme.

299
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It just got a tiny bit stale, but that's okay.

300
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good short attention span game.

301
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:51,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like the Gradius Collection.

302
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't sit there and play Gradius for hours and hours either.

303
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Shooters in general... No comment.

304
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:55,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

305
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:56,896
[SPEAKER_01]: No comment.

306
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Shooters in general to me are short attention span games.

307
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,418
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the way I play.

308
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize for other people it's religion.

309
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like a new Gradius game that was actually really kick-ass.

310
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,001
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because I mean, Gradius V was alright.

311
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:07,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

312
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:24,253
[SPEAKER_05]: There wouldn't be a ship, it'd just be him there just like kicking people over and stuff.

313
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:25,254
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

314
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Put out cigarettes on like other ships or something.

315
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go over to Miklatov, who's reading a book during our show.

316
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're that exciting.

317
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, do you have anything you want to say about your gaming week?

318
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Not our gaming week, but yours.

319
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:38,833
[SPEAKER_02]: My book is good.

320
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're talking about, first of all.

321
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:45,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, all I do is play WoW or I play DJ Max on my PSP.

322
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,700
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to play DS games.

323
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a DS with a bunch of games on it, including imports.

324
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I play Owen Don 2 and Phoenix Wright games, and that's about it.

325
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:55,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And Professor Layton.

326
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have Owen Don 2 on here.

327
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:58,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that with me.

328
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:18,386
[SPEAKER_02]: and Band Brothers Band Brothers is a fun game tell our listeners about DJ Max and some of the things you enjoy about it we have some listeners that really love it it's way better than Beatmania because it's fun and it's not insanely stupid sometimes unlike Beatmania which is insanely stupid most of the time

329
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:29,303
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's easy to pick up and go and the songs are better and it's Korean so it's better because of that.

330
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:37,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, if you can't sense Miklatov's insane bias for Korean-based music and Korean things, because he likes Pump It Up a lot too.

331
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Pump It Up's better than DDR.

332
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:44,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, see, if you can't sense his extreme bias for all things Korean, then take what he says with a grain of salt.

333
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:46,940
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Taiko no Tatrajin DS?

334
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not played that.

335
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't look good.

336
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:53,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the one in the arcade, and I didn't like the one on the PlayStation, so I don't think I'll like the one on the DS.

337
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:59,807
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Max is cool because you can customize everything in it and it's fun.

338
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got stupid videos.

339
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:05,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like the one video with the Power Rangers smashing the girls' flowers.

340
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,672
[SPEAKER_02]: NB Rangers are cool.

341
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:07,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what it was called?

342
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:08,454
[SPEAKER_04]: NB Rangers?

343
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:08,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

344
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:09,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

345
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:10,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

346
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to book.

347
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:14,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Burning Rangers.

348
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew, how was your gaming week?

349
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:19,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

350
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:44,047
[SPEAKER_03]: and getting a little Day of Defeat.

351
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:45,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much else, really.

352
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:51,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently got Brawl and unlocked everything within nine hours of opening the box.

353
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:53,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's dedication.

354
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Still haven't got all the achievements, though, so still a lot of stuff to do.

355
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:02,112
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to register me for Brawl, by the way.

356
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know your friend code off the top of your head?

357
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:07,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Off the top of my head?

358
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:07,513
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

359
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:08,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Nintendo.

360
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not that dedicated.

361
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:12,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to the forums.

362
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:13,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm there.

363
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:13,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at it.

364
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:15,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice plug.

365
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

366
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:18,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on the forums.

367
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:18,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

368
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

369
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's about it.

370
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides Brawl and Hellgate, nothing else.

371
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:30,009
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ratchet in chat says, and again, if you want to join our chatroom, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

372
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,251
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I hope there will eventually be an Elite Beat Agents 2.

373
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:38,072
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as it pains me to say it, fat chance.

374
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:39,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov's agreeing.

375
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you agreeing, Miklatov?

376
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:45,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, I think four people bought it?

377
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it, you bought it.

378
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else bought Elite Beat Agents?

379
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:50,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

380
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,359
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the four right there.

381
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:03,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously it was more than four people that bought it, but the sad thing is you go to Fry's, which is a big electronics store here in California, there were tons and tons of them sitting in the discount bin.

382
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:05,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo just had higher hopes for the game.

383
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:10,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got so discounted so quick because people saw the music list and were like, oh, it's crappy.

384
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:14,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, the music normally would be crappy, but inside the game it was really good.

385
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:17,517
[SPEAKER_03]: September with the cutscenes made you feel epic.

386
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I can discount Elite Beat Agents on account of one song and one song only.

387
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be Canned Heat.

388
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bad cover, but the story was hilarious.

389
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:45,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a bad cover of a good song with a great story, but it was offbeat.

390
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:48,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not so badly offbeat.

391
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, good job.

392
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:51,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Good research, Katamaris Forever.

393
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:56,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Says the actual number of copies sold, 16,000 per VG Charts.

394
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

395
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,673
[SPEAKER_02]: That's practically four.

396
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you consider that there's a lot of crappy games that sell way more than that, it's kind of sad.

397
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:07,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but 16,000, that's not much bigger than four.

398
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:11,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not in the scope of things.

399
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's four times four thousand.

400
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:15,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was close.

401
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:17,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one number right.

402
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, Elite Beat Agents can kind of make you cry, you know, because it has the sad stage.

403
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,571
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always a sad stage.

404
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:28,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one had the Christmas?

405
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:30,394
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Christmas one and there was the... You're the Inspiration.

406
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:32,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one for that game.

407
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,977
[SPEAKER_02]: All the sad stages are sad, except for the Owen Don one.

408
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That one wasn't so sad.

409
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,479
[SPEAKER_04]: But DJ Ratchet's right.

410
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the Inspiration had some hilarious screw-up scenes.

411
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.

412
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:45,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, when you see the dad in, like, a Speedo, that cracked me up.

413
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:54,273
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that was more epic than, say, September in Owen Don would be doing Ready Steady Go, saving the world from a giant meteor.

414
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,897
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so epic, it was hilarious.

415
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Owen Don 2's epic stage.

416
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cooler.

417
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what happens, but I just remember I liked the song better, and it was more fun to play.

418
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,187
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, spoilers for a music game.

419
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

420
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just realizing, is it really $16,000 or is it $160,000?

421
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:16,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be $16,000.

422
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:17,784
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way.

423
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:18,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look.

424
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:18,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

425
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:18,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

426
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:19,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be $160,000.

427
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:20,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look.

428
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:26,993
[SPEAKER_04]: America... I'll find the answer while we get into other stuff throughout the show.

429
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:30,576
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is $16,000, yeah, there's your reason right there why we'll never get one.

430
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:34,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm thinking like, God, I have Judgment sold more than that game?

431
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,281
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sad.

432
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:38,023
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

433
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:39,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Housekeeping tonight.

434
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight is our sixth anniversary show.

435
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:44,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

436
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:45,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Launch.

437
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:46,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get a yay?

438
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:48,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

439
00:24:48,357 --> 00:24:48,637
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

440
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:53,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Launch Radio started on June 23rd, 2008, and it was about as exciting as this episode.

441
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:58,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Allgames.com relaunched this week.

442
00:24:58,729 --> 00:24:59,609
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a whole new look.

443
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:00,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

444
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,870
[SPEAKER_04]: www.allgames.com.

445
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,872
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, of course, the site where we broadcast from every Sunday night live.

446
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:12,155
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've only ever listened to us on your iPod or other type of portable device like PSP, what have you, you're subscribing to our feed.

447
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:13,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Check us out live sometimes.

448
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:23,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday nights we tape at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, just like I want to say Dreadlock Lord in chat is joining us for the first time, I think was saying before the show.

449
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:23,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome.

450
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:25,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Be cool like him.

451
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Come listen to a new show.

452
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:55,848
[SPEAKER_04]: and I wanted to say thanks to me going back and playing Guitar Hero 3 this week I actually thought to check on the Guitar Hero OL Army and I had to go back and approve requests to join from like February so if I neglected to add you to the OL Army you're there now and if you want to join the OL Army go to the Guitar Hero community site and search for OLRMY and you too can join our Guitar Hero OL Army which I promise I will update more than once every four months

453
00:25:56,784 --> 00:26:00,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if you missed it in Part B last week, we had a pretty cool announcement.

454
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:17,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining us next week on the program, Tommy Tallarico will be here for an extended interview where he's going to talk about video games live and his involvement with Gang, which is a big audio guild for people that are into making audio for games, whether they're already doing it or just have an interest in it.

455
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:34,279
[SPEAKER_04]: and more video games live because it's what lots of people are talking about right now Tommy's going to be here to join us talk a lot about that it's pretty cool I'll be next week here on Orange Lounge Radio but for tonight since this is the 6th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio we do have some special things planned for you in part B we're going to bring back a couple of segments

456
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:39,884
[SPEAKER_04]: from OLR's history, and one of them is going to be music game related.

457
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:44,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a list list in Part B tonight, and it does have to do with music games.

458
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be pretty exciting, especially for our long-time listeners who remember our roots.

459
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:52,929
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, though, gaming news throughout the gaming world.

460
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:53,749
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with Loki.

461
00:26:54,389 --> 00:27:06,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this week we had a brand new firmware update for the PSP and it didn't really add a whole lot except for the ability to search on Google straight from the crossmedia bar.

462
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the other thing that they added along with that was now that you can change the viewing speed during video playback by pressing the up and down buttons while you're watching a video.

463
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:22,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

464
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:29,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure they also tried to fix some other holes that were opened up allowing people to run homebrew and stuff.

465
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:34,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that they're already working on a custom firmware 4.0.

466
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:38,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

467
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:39,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't work.

468
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that they're calling it 4.0?

469
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because they had so many updates that were getting close to the 4.0 anyways.

470
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:52,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like 3.96 and stuff.

471
00:27:52,788 --> 00:28:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Might as well just go 4.0 because I guess they would consider the internet search function as a brand new feature or something like that instead of just a little update.

472
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

473
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're just running out of numbers.

474
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:09,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

475
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Elite Beat Agents for a minute.

476
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:16,834
[SPEAKER_04]: because this news about the 4.0 firmware kind of bores me because they really didn't do much to call this 4.0.

477
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I was expecting something a little more landmark.

478
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:28,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Elite Beat Agents, it actually sold .17 million, which would be 170,000 copies, not 16,000.

479
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,237
[SPEAKER_04]: That must have been just in the first week or something.

480
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, that's still not enough to get another game.

481
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:36,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's also still not as much as... Eye of Judgment, right?

482
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:39,459
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is only released, though, in two regions, though.

483
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to also count...

484
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:43,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, you know, Owen Dunn.

485
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:48,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I Have Judgment has sold 0.21 million copies, granted that's worldwide.

486
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,142
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the money?

487
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:52,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't sell better than Crisis.

488
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:53,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

489
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:56,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Comparing it to some other games.

490
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:57,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

491
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:59,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Barbie and the Twelve Dancing Princesses.

492
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:01,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we don't have sales data for that.

493
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:01,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

494
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:02,349
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of these other ones?

495
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I can find.

496
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there we go.

497
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:08,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Barbie Island Princess on the DS.

498
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:09,993
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.14 million copies.

499
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,974
[SPEAKER_04]: That's only 30,000 less than Owen Don.

500
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:15,616
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Let's Ride Friends Forever?

501
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:22,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in the database, sadly.

502
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:24,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, it's so crappy it's not even there.

503
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:26,108
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Imagine Babies?

504
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:28,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, I found Let's Ride Friends Forever.

505
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine Babies, you'd be surprised, is actually in the top-selling DS titles.

506
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:34,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand it.

507
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:35,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly don't understand it.

508
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:37,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, wow, wow, get this.

509
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:41,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever sold in its first week of release?

510
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,021
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

511
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:42,021
986.

512
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:42,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet!

513
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:43,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Add that to the...

514
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:58,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, you're about, what is it, 200, or 211,000 copies now of Eye of Judgment?

515
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wow, wow, okay.

516
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:03,223
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

517
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank God, I'm sorry.

518
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:09,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Elite Beat Agents, 170,000 copies, right?

519
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:11,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine Babies, you ready for this?

520
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,993
[SPEAKER_04]: 1.85 million copies have sold.

521
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:42,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pervigicharts.com That makes sense though Seriously, it's weird People buy it for their little girls because they want them to know how to raise their babies It's absolutely weird That game right there is seriously up in the top of the DS charts and also Imagine Fashion Designer is up there too I vow Since I own the game thanks to somebody in this room I'm going to play Imagine Babies next week

522
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,641
[SPEAKER_01]: and come back and report on it.

523
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:45,521
[SPEAKER_04]: You do that.

524
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: You better make good on it.

525
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:52,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, breaking a million copies sold, Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Happy Cooking.

526
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:54,404
[SPEAKER_04]: How many did Cooking Mama sell?

527
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:54,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Last one.

528
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:57,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking Mama.

529
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:58,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Elite Beat Agents sold 170,000.

530
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:01,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking Mama sold 2.74 million copies.

531
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:02,387
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Cooking Mama 2?

532
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:03,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that did as well.

533
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:06,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking Mama 2, 1.19 million.

534
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind these are worldwide numbers.

535
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:11,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

536
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:16,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God I wasn't like, imagine babies, no one will buy that.

537
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:19,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just add that to the thing.

538
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops!

539
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:21,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smart.

540
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:22,642
[SPEAKER_04]: You are very smart.

541
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing you didn't take that as part of the bet.

542
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see.

543
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:32,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony planning a clampdown on PSP pirating.

544
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:33,785
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

545
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:39,691
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a piracy problem on the PSP, said Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe president David Reeves.

546
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know about it.

547
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We know how it's done.

548
00:31:43,954 --> 00:31:49,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically they know how to log on to any of the many blogs out there that specifically talk about PSP hacking.

549
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:53,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, they're gonna really clamp down on PSP piracy.

550
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:59,667
[SPEAKER_04]: These were quotes from Sony's Devastation developer conference that was held in London.

551
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:09,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not all bad news because sometimes piracy, says David Reeves, fuels the growth of hardware sales.

552
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:12,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So people buy PSP.

553
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:13,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

554
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually kind of see that because a lot of people bought the PSP when they found out that they were able to play NES games on them.

555
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of true.

556
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:27,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people that when they first got them, that's all they did is they had me put emulators on there for them and they played NES games.

557
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:30,127
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends went right out and bought one and then modded his battery.

558
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:34,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one thing to note though, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up.

559
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:41,117
[SPEAKER_04]: He went on to say that there are plans going on that will crack down on the numbers of pirates out there.

560
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,019
[SPEAKER_05]: There is nothing they can do.

561
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely nothing.

562
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: They have said this forever and they have tried different methods and it's slowed people down but then eventually they come back around and they find a new way about it.

563
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,539
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no chance.

564
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your time.

565
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha ha.

566
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:26,073
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the last time that you heard about hacking being done on the PlayStation 3?

567
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:32,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of them actually trying things, but they still haven't gotten anything to work yet.

568
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:38,528
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation 3 has a more don't give a shit attitude towards installing Linux on it and all that stuff, right?

569
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:38,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

570
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:40,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why people don't care.

571
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:45,447
[SPEAKER_05]: People are looking to find ways to run homebrew stuff on it.

572
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:47,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I think mainly they're trying to find ways to pirate stuff.

573
00:33:47,908 --> 00:34:00,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But even stuff... Even, let's just say, you were able to pirate games on the PS3, it's not really as easy because, I mean, if you dump a PlayStation 3 game, that's, like, upwards to 50 gigs.

574
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:04,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're only going to be able to throw, like, one or two on your hard drive at a time.

575
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:05,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just...

576
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just more cumbersome.

577
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Just forget it and they'll do it on the 360 instead.

578
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get to our next story, a comment from chat.

579
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:18,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Amaze Satsuma in chat says, There is one way to stop pirates.

580
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:20,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Send ninjas out to kill them.

581
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:22,774
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

582
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:24,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what, though?

583
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:31,638
[SPEAKER_05]: There are ninjas that are, you know, acting in... They're participating in piracy, actually.

584
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:36,680
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the Wii Ninja, which is a mod chip for the Wii that allows you to play pirated games.

585
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:41,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Siren in chat says, what is a pirate?

586
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:42,975
[SPEAKER_04]: A miserable little pile of hacks.

587
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:44,377
[SPEAKER_04]: But enough talk.

588
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:45,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Have at you.

589
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Please save us from this nonsense in our chat room while we get to another story.

590
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, you killed it.

591
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:54,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I didn't say it.

592
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:55,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Siren said it.

593
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:56,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I gotta?

594
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:56,748
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta.

595
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:03,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some news about the MMO that Bioware is squirting out.

596
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,806
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that it's supposed to be out between April 2010 and April 2011.

597
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:24,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the article actually said that EA was funding an MMO, but EA owns Bioware, and it's in Austin, so that's where they got the information from.

598
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:32,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no more information exactly about what it's going to be, but the theory is Knights of the Old Republic, so...

599
00:35:35,578 --> 00:35:36,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

600
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:37,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Possible.

601
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:38,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

602
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,539
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be interesting.

603
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, yes, say.

604
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:47,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, there's going to be some pretty interesting stuff coming out about Resistance 2.

605
00:35:48,243 --> 00:36:04,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, just recently they had some gameplay videos that were premiering on GameTrailersTV, and now GamePro has the scoop on some more stuff, including they're going to be giving out, in random issues of GamePro, free Resistance 2 beta codes.

606
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:06,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll be able to get in on the beta for that.

607
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're hoping to sell a few more magazines with that as well.

608
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:12,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't know about you, but I don't think GamePro is doing that great right now.

609
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:17,420
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some people out there that would buy like 10 copies to get a golden ticket, quote unquote, right?

610
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

611
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they say about how many of the magazines are going to have this?

612
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:20,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

613
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:22,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

614
00:36:22,696 --> 00:36:31,120
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were saying that there's tons of juicy stuff in there and they're saying it's bigger than Halo, bigger than Call of Duty.

615
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry though, or better than Halo.

616
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:39,125
[SPEAKER_05]: They said a lot of things are better than Halo, unfortunately.

617
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:42,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But Resistance 2 is going to be awesome.

618
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance 1 was absolutely cool.

619
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:50,231
[SPEAKER_05]: If you loved Call of Duty and you want more of a sci-fi game, this is perfect for you.

620
00:36:52,489 --> 00:37:05,651
[SPEAKER_04]: of course and I don't think it made tonight's show roll but I want to say something I read something about Call of Duty 6 is supposed to be like sci-fi related yeah in response to this no I would think they're just getting you know they're trying to mix it up a bit but

621
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:11,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know if that worked really well for Battlefield 2142 either, though.

622
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:14,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they tried to mix it up a bit and go a little sci-fi and futuristic.

623
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:19,874
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and Tom Clancy's been doing that, or the Tom Clancy series, I guess.

624
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:23,256
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with Hawks and End War and that kind of stuff.

625
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:27,520
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I honestly think that Resistance is going to be awesome.

626
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance, I absolutely, out of the first-person shooters I've played, Gears of War, Halo 3...

627
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:35,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a lot of them out there.

628
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:37,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance was my favorite.

629
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:38,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

630
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:43,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is weird because, you know, usually I'm not too favorable on stuff for the PlayStation 3.

631
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it honestly is a good game.

632
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm definitely buying the next one.

633
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:50,321
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

634
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:54,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of reading some other crazy stuff in chat.

635
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:58,264
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ratchet speculates it ends up only five game pros have it.

636
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:00,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually does turn into Willy Wonka.

637
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:06,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're assuming that's going to be over 60 since they're obviously going to be stress testing servers.

638
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:10,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's going to be 60 player online with Resistance 2.

639
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:15,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be more Resistance 2 beta keys than copies of Elite Beat Agents sold?

640
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Solid 4 476,334 copies were sold in the first week

641
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:51,676
[SPEAKER_04]: and by the way, 77,208 consoles were sold that week and that is, if you kind of do the math there, that's what about like one in four, no, one in five?

642
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:56,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So like one out of every five copies of the game sold also pushed a console.

643
00:38:57,718 --> 00:38:58,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty big.

644
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,059
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

645
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:08,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Over in the UK... Yeah, because one out of every five copies was probably one of those consoles that included the game with it.

646
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:09,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

647
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:16,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Over in the UK, it should be noted that Metal Gear Solid 4, while it sold well, it did not do quite as well as Grand Theft Auto 4.

648
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:22,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 14,000 copies short of the Metal Gear Solid 2 release in 2002.

649
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:32,665
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I have a bad feeling that they're going to start really fudging their numbers with, oh yeah, look how many consoles this game pushed.

650
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, because you're including it with all the consoles.

651
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:40,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it's going to be kind of equal with the console sales.

652
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:42,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

653
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:46,430
[SPEAKER_04]: We even know people that have went out and bought a PlayStation 3 just for this game.

654
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:47,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can believe it.

655
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:50,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's an awesome game.

656
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:55,253
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, when Final Fantasy XIII comes out, I will probably buy a PlayStation 3 just for that game, so what can you do?

657
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:56,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, don't worry about that time, you know.

658
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:59,117
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 4 will be coming out, so.

659
00:39:59,317 --> 00:39:59,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

660
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:04,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, maybe Sony Home I'll actually have to play as well.

661
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:07,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure it'll eventually be out, you know, in beta form, of course.

662
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:27,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for other news, if anyone's been interested in LittleBigPlanet, the Sony Experience is coming by on a bunch of trucks that has different kiosks with games in it, such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Metal Gear Solid 4 and PSP games.

663
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:36,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's traveling all over the country, so if you go to us.playstation.com you can find links to tour dates there.

664
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you happen to have the dates in front of you by chance?

665
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:41,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering if there's anything local where you can go crash.

666
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:44,128
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very few tour dates.

667
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

668
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So not a big tour right now?

669
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:51,295
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's like each truck's doing like four different cities and that's it.

670
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I have three locations according to this one.

671
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:58,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just Baltimore and Milwaukee.

672
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:00,685
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe more to come.

673
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:09,298
[SPEAKER_04]: When that Rock Band tour started, didn't they only have a few dates and then finally it exploded into all these places before the game came out?

674
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:10,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

675
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,884
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation Patrol tour is going to Davenport, Iowa, Huntsville, Alabama I should go visit my family.

676
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:23,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Traverse City, Michigan and New York City.

677
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they have to hate the West Coast?

678
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a single West Coast date in there.

679
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:36,509
[SPEAKER_01]: But the New York City date is July 11th through July 15th, so if any of our listeners get the urge, go check it out for us.

680
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:39,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and please go ask them why they hate us so much on the West Coast.

681
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:45,955
[SPEAKER_04]: They were probably already here, and I didn't even care.

682
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been here before.

683
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:51,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They usually come to our local Sunrise Hall every now and then.

684
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,621
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know we had the signing at the Metreon, right?

685
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:56,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's true.

686
00:41:57,009 --> 00:41:59,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see no LittleBigPlanet there.

687
00:42:00,558 --> 00:42:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about Metal Gear Solid?

688
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:03,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about LittleBigPlanet.

689
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:10,078
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, go follow the tour bus or something.

690
00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:14,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you happen to go, take a camera or something and tell us about your experience.

691
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:21,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, there was a whole bunch of drama last week with Itagaki leaving Tecmo and Team Ninja behind.

692
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:25,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised he did not tip over everything on his way out.

693
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:28,449
[SPEAKER_04]: If he has, we probably just haven't heard it yet.

694
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

695
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,212
[SPEAKER_05]: He probably just threw a manager through a window and then jumped down, you know?

696
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:35,280
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

697
00:42:45,195 --> 00:43:00,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, anyways, so they have, um, served a gag order for him to, um, basically not disclose or leak any Tecmo, uh, trade secrets and, you know, make any false or misleading statements, et cetera, et cetera.

698
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,574
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem is, though, that it hasn't been signed off by the court yet, so he's talking now.

699
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:10,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Nidagaki put out a press statement of his own that says, you don't tell me to shut the fuck up.

700
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:13,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back and kill you again.

701
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:14,924
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I do what I want.

702
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:36,010
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

703
00:43:57,529 --> 00:43:58,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Motive.

704
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there could definitely be a game here.

705
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:03,456
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to elevate him to a Chuck Norris status.

706
00:44:03,596 --> 00:44:05,838
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to be immortal at some point.

707
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:08,061
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the Chuck Norris of game designers, really.

708
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:11,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Itagaki.

709
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:13,046
[SPEAKER_01]: He laughs at Chuck Norris.

710
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:17,912
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have to do anything better than Chuck Norris because you think Chuck Norris is fucking funny.

711
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:28,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Tecmo, the man, denies that Team Ninja is actually leaving them, and also kind of denying different aspects about the lawsuit.

712
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,525
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that they say was inaccurate was that all of the employees were suing Tecmo.

713
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:36,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes and no.

714
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:41,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually two employees suing Tecmo on behalf of all the other employees, so...

715
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,376
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like some sort of convoluted class action.

716
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:46,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a whole lot of weird stuff going on there.

717
00:44:46,878 --> 00:44:48,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese law is kind of funny anyway.

718
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:51,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Not paying overtime and that kind of thing, you know.

719
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:52,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

720
00:44:56,244 --> 00:45:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this why, you know, Tecmo Bowl is just taking forever to come out?

721
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:02,768
[SPEAKER_01]: But Team Ninja doesn't do Tecmo Bowl.

722
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:04,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Ninja should do Tecmo Bowl.

723
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:07,476
[SPEAKER_04]: NinjaBowl.

724
00:45:08,218 --> 00:45:08,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be fine.

725
00:45:08,698 --> 00:45:10,301
[SPEAKER_01]: There's... Rob, okay.

726
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:11,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember Battle Chess?

727
00:45:11,964 --> 00:45:12,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

728
00:45:12,164 --> 00:45:12,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

729
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:12,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, yeah.

730
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they would, like, kill each other and everything?

731
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:15,771
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.

732
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,193
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have, like, Battle Football.

733
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:18,055
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

734
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:18,756
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

735
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:19,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they...

736
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:19,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

737
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:20,671
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

738
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:24,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, listen, this is what Itagaki's new job's going to be, okay?

739
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:24,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

740
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:42,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, if you imagine, you know, like a kitchen stadium, except it's not a kitchen stadium, it's just a stadium with Itagaki being the chairman, and he has people fight each other to the death with a secret weapon that is revealed on each show.

741
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

742
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:50,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So Itagaki should not be so worried about this divorce from Tecmo because he will be a rock star elsewhere.

743
00:45:50,992 --> 00:45:51,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they'll pick him up.

744
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft will probably have him work for him.

745
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:55,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

746
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

747
00:45:57,785 --> 00:45:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

748
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

749
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:55,470
[SPEAKER_04]: and the system here, little Sony Ericsson, comes with games on it.

750
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowling, Bash Fishing, and Jockey.

751
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:04,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of them use an accelerometer that is actually located inside the device as well.

752
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:07,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Why in the hell does your phone need an accelerometer?

753
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:12,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure, unless it knows to shut off if it's falling out of your pocket or something.

754
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:12,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

755
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:13,557
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

756
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:15,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have one in it.

757
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:20,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if it senses that you're falling for a long time, it's like, you're falling to your death.

758
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:21,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you wish to call loved ones?

759
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:22,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes or no?

760
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:27,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

761
00:47:29,678 --> 00:47:32,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't ask you yes or no because all it's going to get is, ah!

762
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:35,380
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it's going to get.

763
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Death Death Death Death Death

764
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:03,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fake in the movie, but it was real when Itagaki did it.

765
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:07,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Except he landed and he's like, fuck this, I'm too cool to die.

766
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And then shot the plane down.

767
00:48:08,795 --> 00:48:09,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

768
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:12,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

769
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how about some completely innocent and happy news?

770
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:17,206
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

771
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:18,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney!

772
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:25,670
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes me kind of... I just think it's funny because I'm going to have to draw the parallel, okay?

773
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:35,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney is making a game about a dog who shoots laser beams from his eyes and barks with a sonic boom.

774
00:48:35,657 --> 00:48:36,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

775
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:38,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've heard of this game before.

776
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,041
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

777
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, continue on.

778
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,102
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an animated movie.

779
00:48:44,163 --> 00:48:45,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And his owner is called Penny.

780
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Who, besides me, is singing Inspector Gadget?

781
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:52,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry Brain is not that cool.

782
00:48:53,457 --> 00:48:56,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but it's a girl named Penny who hacks.

783
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,281
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a hacker.

784
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:01,263
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Inspector Gadget, but with a cooler dog.

785
00:49:01,363 --> 00:49:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Little kids are not hackers.

786
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:07,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you mix Inspector Gadget and the dog and give him John Travolta's voice.

787
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:14,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I have a question for the nerdy... I have a question for nerdy heterosexual straight guys in chat.

788
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:15,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Instapoll here.

789
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:17,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Heterosexual nerdy straight guys only.

790
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:20,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a crush on Penny growing up?

791
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:23,376
[SPEAKER_01]: or Lesbians.

792
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:26,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn Skippy, she was hot.

793
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

794
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:30,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my issues as a kid.

795
00:49:31,742 --> 00:49:33,724
[SPEAKER_03]: She was the only smart one in the whole damn place.

796
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:35,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Into schoolboy lust.

797
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:48,797
[SPEAKER_01]: To continue, the dog's name is Bolt.

798
00:49:49,897 --> 00:49:56,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically him and Penny traveling the world and taking care of shit.

799
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,640
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is actually going to be on everything but the PSP.

800
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:13,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to tie in with a movie about a famous dog with superpowers who's on a television show and gets shipped to New York by accident so he's trying to get back to Hollywood.

801
00:50:14,483 --> 00:50:16,424
[SPEAKER_01]: and John Travolta is doing his voice.

802
00:50:17,865 --> 00:50:28,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those people who may be interested, it was, I'm not sure if it still is, animated by the same people that did, or the same artists, I should say, that did Lilo and Stitch.

803
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:30,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's pretty cool.

804
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:38,176
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's check out the results of our instant quick poll, brought to you by our chat room, chat.orangelunchradio.com.

805
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:42,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Question was, for the heterosexual men in our chat room,

806
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:44,644
[SPEAKER_04]: was Penny hot?

807
00:50:45,144 --> 00:51:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, hell yeah, yes, lol, Penny was cool, no, no, no, no, I thought she was awesome, I thought Brain was hotter, I was too young, what the fuck, no, yeah, Penny was hot, even for a lol, I'll say no, I didn't think she was hot, blonde pigtails, pigtails equals handles, Penny was hot.

808
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:12,375
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was too busy as a child crushing on Sasami from Tenshi Muyo.

809
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:13,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

810
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:14,617
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely dates you.

811
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:19,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And my favorite, Vicky from Small Wonder greater than Penny from Inspector Gadget.

812
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:22,864
[SPEAKER_01]: What, because you like a robo-chick that can, you know, not wear out?

813
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:24,425
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

814
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, chat room, for participating in that.

815
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:31,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We better have Harley!

816
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:32,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Harley!

817
00:51:57,768 --> 00:52:09,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Including The Flash, Robin, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Black Canary, Hawkman, and Power Girl Cool!

818
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:10,926
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got big boobs

819
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry!

820
00:52:14,169 --> 00:52:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know what?

821
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:17,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad she said that because I don't really follow comics.

822
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea who Power Girl is.

823
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:21,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Is she a girl dressed up like a Duracell battery or something?

824
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:25,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to... Okay, Power Girl is actually Supergirl from a different universe.

825
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:28,637
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's exactly the same person as Supergirl but has these humongous boobs.

826
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:30,078
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the only difference.

827
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Big-breasted universe.

828
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:32,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I can dig that.

829
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:32,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I can dig that.

830
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, they're also saying...

831
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:42,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That there's a possible two-game deal and download content as well.

832
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,420
[SPEAKER_05]: She has big boobies.

833
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.

834
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:46,101
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

835
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:48,882
[SPEAKER_01]: No, look at the picture that Alex Ross did, okay?

836
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:49,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking away now.

837
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: But hold on.

838
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:54,103
[SPEAKER_04]: On this Justice League Unlimited... That's a stupid cartoon.

839
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:56,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she does not have big boobies there.

840
00:52:56,144 --> 00:53:01,326
[SPEAKER_04]: She has weird... She has... Her boobs look like a cucumber stuffed on her shirt.

841
00:53:01,406 --> 00:53:01,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

842
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

843
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:05,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up Power Girl and Alex Ross and look at... That's the picture he did.

844
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

845
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are... Wow.

846
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I saw boobs like that on the Jerry Springer show once.

847
00:53:13,272 --> 00:53:13,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.

848
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:16,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

849
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:20,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee, I have no idea why that character was picked for the game.

850
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:27,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Robin I've heard of, Wonder Woman I've heard of, pretty much every single one of those other characters you've named I've heard of.

851
00:53:27,526 --> 00:53:30,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Power Girl I had never heard of, but now I understand why she's in the game.

852
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:35,370
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few others I wouldn't mind seeing in it.

853
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Harley.

854
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:38,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Harley Quinn.

855
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:38,973
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that?

856
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:40,554
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with that?

857
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:41,475
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with that?

858
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:42,456
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

859
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:44,558
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with this?

860
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:49,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, if you look at some of these, just do a Google image search.

861
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:52,284
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got one that's like, crap.

862
00:53:53,966 --> 00:53:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

863
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:56,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty busty.

864
00:53:56,428 --> 00:53:56,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Approval.

865
00:53:56,768 --> 00:53:57,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Massive approval.

866
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, have you ever heard of Power Girl before tonight?

867
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:07,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

868
00:54:08,404 --> 00:54:09,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you'll never forget.

869
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:13,927
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I probably will.

870
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:19,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made no secret of it that I'm not the world's biggest DC fan, but I've got characters I like.

871
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like her because she's bitchy.

872
00:54:21,753 --> 00:54:22,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is fair.

873
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:24,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's got boobs.

874
00:54:24,614 --> 00:54:25,215
[SPEAKER_01]: She's bitchy.

875
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:31,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun says Harley Quinn was the first character I made in Soul Calibur 3 in the create your own character mode.

876
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:40,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first character I made was a totally naked person wearing a bishop's hat that did like capoeira dancing or something.

877
00:54:40,592 --> 00:54:41,272
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.

878
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,573
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

879
00:54:44,093 --> 00:54:44,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

880
00:54:45,552 --> 00:55:02,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea how to segue into this story so I will just say the ESRB is sadly going to probably no longer be leaking game announcements early because you know we find out about all these cool games because they show up on the ESRB's website like there was Earthbound coming to the Wii, right?

881
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:04,419
[SPEAKER_04]: We found out about that early.

882
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:07,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania, the full name of that game.

883
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you still laughing, Loki?

884
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So speaking of big boobs... I hear giggling in my right ear.

885
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:15,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Andrew?

886
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:16,825
[SPEAKER_05]: He's... I don't know.

887
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:19,529
[SPEAKER_05]: He started off a joke, and I don't know where it's going.

888
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:19,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

889
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,693
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways... Is it from the toilet paper book?

890
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:22,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

891
00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:27,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, though, yeah, it sucks that the ESRB's not gonna be... Wait, wait, I didn't even say why.

892
00:55:27,542 --> 00:55:27,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

893
00:55:28,603 --> 00:55:29,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me finish the story.

894
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:30,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

895
00:55:30,886 --> 00:55:31,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just excited.

896
00:55:58,727 --> 00:56:04,752
[SPEAKER_04]: If publishers arbitrarily select dates bearing no reasonable relationships to consumers' interest in the product.

897
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: But, it should be noted, this would still have no effect on some of the other ways that games have been leaked through official agencies such as the OFLC in Australia, and so on.

898
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:18,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, you had a comment.

899
00:56:19,164 --> 00:56:20,645
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what I was going to say.

900
00:56:20,765 --> 00:56:22,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that doesn't stop everybody else from doing it.

901
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:28,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides, you know, there's a lot of other ways to find out about leaked dates.

902
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:31,746
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't know of any of them, right?

903
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:32,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course not.

904
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:33,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course not.

905
00:56:33,887 --> 00:56:34,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

906
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:34,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

907
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:39,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys, but I kind of liked when the ESRB would leak things early.

908
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I feel like I'm going to be sitting in the dark until they want me to know about release dates.

909
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:46,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like ruining Christmas.

910
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I like finding out about stuff early.

911
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:51,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ESRB news kind of makes me a little bit angsty.

912
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:54,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I get angsty, we cue the FU music.

913
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:39,544
[SPEAKER_01]: just a massive F you to the assholes on the Ragnarok server I play on who are duplicating items and selling them and basically doing a whole bunch of shit that's now I wouldn't say it's completely ruined everything but it's made things difficult for other people so fuck you to them Loki F you to PHP for being needlessly complicated and F you to my car for leaking coolant

914
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't.

915
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:42,094
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not good.

916
00:57:42,474 --> 00:57:50,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when the people that flushed my radiator and checked a bunch of stuff because they thought my car had overheated, even though it hadn't.

917
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And ever since they fixed it, it's been leaking coolant.

918
00:57:57,718 --> 00:57:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

919
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:00,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two FUs of the week.

920
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:07,041
[SPEAKER_04]: My first FU goes to me for spending $10 to go watch The Happening, which was horrible.

921
00:58:08,376 --> 00:58:14,338
[SPEAKER_04]: and not even like so bad it was good, like Showgirls, you know, bad, but it was just bad.

922
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:16,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really, really bad.

923
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:24,741
[SPEAKER_04]: My other FU goes to the fact, and this is a much bigger FU, my other FU goes to the fact that I had to have not just one, but two MRIs last week.

924
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:33,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I went in for an MRI, because you know, if you've been listening to this show the past three months, you know I've been having issues with my pancreas that kept me out a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital, blah, blah, blah, cry me a river.

925
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to They were probably trying to illuminate your pancreas

926
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:58,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, it's not so much that drinking and stuff is horrible, but having to leave work early, go to this place, whatever.

927
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:00,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went in on Thursday, had it done.

928
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,784
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me at 5 o'clock at night.

929
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rob, the thing that your doctor wanted to see doesn't come out clear in our MRI thing because we have an older MRI thing out here in Folsom.

930
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:14,655
[SPEAKER_04]: We need you to go to our Roseville office where they have a newer MRI machine.

931
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Things you could have told me about the first time.

932
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,881
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't written on there what my doctor was looking for or nothing.

933
00:59:20,941 --> 00:59:25,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you didn't think it was going to come up on the old one, why didn't you just tell me to go to the new place to start with?

934
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:30,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of making me miss two days of work and have to drink that nasty, nasty stuff twice.

935
00:59:31,726 --> 00:59:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but anyway, I'm hoping the MRIs show that I'm healthy again.

936
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:37,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Because otherwise I'll be filled with more FUs.

937
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:39,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody wants that.

938
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew.

939
00:59:41,431 --> 00:59:45,232
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, FU to GameStop for closing at 6 on Sundays.

940
00:59:45,412 --> 00:59:50,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to go in and apparently they were giving away Deoxys at GameStop all weekend.

941
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:52,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Just missed it by two minutes.

942
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:53,874
[SPEAKER_03]: D'oh!

943
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:58,274
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the community on Team Fortress 2.

[SPEAKER_03]: Achievement pack comes out for, say, Pyro.

945
01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:02,275
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have?

[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of Pyros on the servers.

947
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:05,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else.

948
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:06,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy pickings were heavy, though.

949
01:00:07,656 --> 01:00:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And FU to Hellgate for being such a bitch and a half to install.

950
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:16,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it then for our FUs of the Week.

951
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:19,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov left the room.

952
01:00:19,706 --> 01:00:23,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he finished the book so he had to go find something else to do.

953
01:00:24,268 --> 01:00:29,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so now we're going to move into some release dates and travel around the world and see what's coming out where.

954
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:31,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Release dates, we'll start off with DarkSakura.

955
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:35,884
[SPEAKER_01]: We have releases, and stuff is coming out the end.

956
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:36,564

[SPEAKER_04]: It's not for everybody.

986
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:12,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad thing that the fitness craze has taken over in the video game world right now.

1007
01:04:56,923 --> 01:04:57,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Lone of the Dark

1008
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:21,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a little bit of controversy over that, because Atari's accusing people of...

1009
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:39,176
[SPEAKER_05]: To their offense, they didn't play a pirated version.

1010
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:41,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just they got one that someone broke street on.

1011
01:05:42,177 --> 01:05:50,801
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not necessarily their fault, but I still think it's fucked up that Atari's like, oh, we don't want any independent reviews out there because God forbid it, you know.

1012
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:54,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have told them I was going to give it a good review, but fuck you.

1013
01:05:55,504 --> 01:05:55,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1014
01:05:56,445 --> 01:05:57,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It's annoying.

1015
01:05:58,326 --> 01:06:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not forget, though, and we do have another story about this game, but let's not forget that Driver 3, Atari paid off people to give it good reviews.

1016
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:09,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep that fresh in your mind.

1017
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:11,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

1018
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapid Slasher in chat says, if you buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith, you are a tool.

1019
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:18,430
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband's buying it.

1020
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:19,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it back.

1021
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's buying it.

1022
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:23,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it back.

1023
01:06:25,516 --> 01:06:26,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to face the wrath of Jamie.

1024
01:06:27,638 --> 01:06:29,339
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a waste of money, in my opinion.

1025
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care for these add-on games that are coming out in the middle there.

1026
01:06:34,966 --> 01:06:37,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could put that stuff out as download content.

1027
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:40,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the song list could have been a little better.

1028
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:55,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I saw the finalized song list today and, you know, it's... I just don't understand why they can't do, like, say, like a $20 download thing or something like that for Guitar Hero 3 and just call it... Because they did that with, what was it, Samurai Warriors 2 Empires or something like that.

1029
01:06:56,095 --> 01:07:00,397
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to release its own 360 game for that, but they decided, hey, you know what?

1030
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:02,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really that much different.

1031
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:06,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just kind of an add-on, so we're just going to release this as download content, and that's what they did.

1032
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:08,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why they just don't do that with this.

1033
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,740
[SPEAKER_05]: He took it back.

1034
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably because of the PS2 owners.

1035
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:13,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn right he took it back.

1036
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:14,942
[SPEAKER_03]: For you and far between as we are.

1037
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:19,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can release it on those systems, but just don't release it.

1038
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the Rock Band trackpacks.

1039
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:25,830
[SPEAKER_05]: They can release that stuff standalone, or you can do a download for cheaper.

1040
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:30,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Rapid Slasher clarifies the comment and says it's just that the song list is really weak.

1041
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:31,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of agree.

1042
01:07:31,474 --> 01:07:33,035
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband's favorite band is Aerosmith.

1043
01:07:34,396 --> 01:07:35,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then, there you go.

1044
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:38,179
[SPEAKER_05]: He probably won't be too interested in Guitar Hero Metallica next year.

1045
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,600
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for me.

1046
01:07:40,261 --> 01:07:42,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero Tool isn't a bad idea, though.

1047
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:43,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1048
01:07:45,058 --> 01:07:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Aerosmith and all, but I'm more of just a fan of Guitar Hero and I wouldn't mind having a lot of new songs to play from.

1049
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:56,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not buying any of these games until Guitar Hero DVD comes out.

1050
01:07:58,655 --> 01:08:00,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I kind of want a new guitar, too.

1051
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,397
[SPEAKER_04]: My other one is starting to break.

1052
01:08:01,437 --> 01:08:02,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had it since Guitar Hero 2.

1053
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But I need a guitar that's going to be compatible with Rock Band, or I'm just not interested.

1054
01:08:07,162 --> 01:08:09,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you probably don't want a Guitar Hero guitar.

1055
01:08:10,045 --> 01:08:11,326
[SPEAKER_04]: God, so stupid.

1056
01:08:11,786 --> 01:08:13,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate both of those companies.

1057
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:18,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I really shouldn't buy any of these games anymore until they find a way to make it work.

1058
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:22,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the 360, though, you do have to remember that they are at least compatible with each other.

1059
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:24,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas if you had a PS3, you're fucked.

1060
01:08:25,638 --> 01:08:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1061
01:08:27,296 --> 01:08:29,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya's Guitar Hero Journey.

1062
01:08:29,156 --> 01:08:30,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I would be there first in line.

1063
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:31,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd pre-order it the minute it was announced.

1064
01:08:32,117 --> 01:08:32,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1065
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:35,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting over to Japanese release dates.

1066
01:08:35,638 --> 01:08:41,219
[SPEAKER_04]: My usual source of information of Japanese release dates is not working right now, so I have an abbreviated list for you guys.

1067
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:46,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Over in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, they get Battlefield Bad Company comes out.

1068
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:52,342
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, The Darkness finally makes its way to Japan, as well as Quake Wars, or Enemy Territory Quake Wars.

1069
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:56,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Nintendo Re... Nintendo... Did I say Nintendo Re...

1070
01:08:58,787 --> 01:08:59,468
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii!

1071
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:00,148
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii!

1072
01:09:00,308 --> 01:09:01,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Ford Racing!

1073
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:07,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Ford Racing Off-Road was what I was starting to say, but somehow combined it all into one word.

1074
01:09:08,372 --> 01:09:08,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.

1075
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:11,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for release dates.

1076
01:09:14,695 --> 01:09:19,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's other stuff in case anyone is interested.

1077
01:09:19,797 --> 01:09:21,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am particularly interested in this myself.

1078
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:24,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you know what one of my favorite games ever is?

1079
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:45,147
[SPEAKER_01]: um Custer's Revenge hell no Dragon's Lair and um the 25th anniversary of Dragon's Lair is coming about and so the um uh artistic uh I would say uh well the animator that's behind it Don Bluth um is uh

1080
01:09:46,287 --> 01:09:56,949
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I understand, it's going to be doing an autographed version of the game for a week that will be on DVD, PC, and Blu-ray.

1081
01:09:57,249 --> 01:10:04,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to be designed by Rick Dyer, who was the designer, and two of the other animators, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy.

1082
01:10:04,711 --> 01:10:10,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully the Blu-ray version actually works this time instead of it being broken.

1083
01:10:11,197 --> 01:10:20,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they said the Blu-ray version is supposed to run at 1080p and play just like the original coin-op version.

1084
01:10:21,059 --> 01:10:24,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's supposed to be lobby posters that are $80 each.

1085
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez.

1086
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get Space Ace while we're at it?

1087
01:10:28,901 --> 01:10:29,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

1088
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:33,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe when the anniversary for Space Ace comes about.

1089
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:35,082
[SPEAKER_04]: How about they just animate a new, like, Dragon's Lair 3?

1090
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:38,249
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1091
01:10:57,595 --> 01:10:59,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the music in it was very creepy.

1092
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:00,058
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I want?

1093
01:11:00,178 --> 01:11:04,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a Clerks animated game that's done just like Dragon's Lair.

1094
01:11:04,623 --> 01:11:05,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have, who's driving car?

1095
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:06,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Bear's driving car!

1096
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:06,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Left!

1097
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:08,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1098
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: How can this be?

1099
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,113
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be a Clerks game somewhere, I'm just not sure that's it, Loki.

1100
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:15,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I don't think the market's real open for in-action games.

1101
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:18,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Wah, wah.

1102
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:25,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Just set it right in front of you.

1103
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:45,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That will feature a gun peripheral for the Wii that's kind of like, you know, something that you strap the remote into.

1104
01:11:45,323 --> 01:11:51,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're not playing the Wii, you can actually turn it into a real Nerf gun and fire at people's heads.

1105
01:11:51,944 --> 01:11:54,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Like God intended it.

1106
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:59,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be $59.99 and will include, of course, the gun shell.

1107
01:12:00,187 --> 01:12:01,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It's due out November 17th.

1108
01:12:02,813 --> 01:12:03,174
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1109
01:12:18,578 --> 01:12:23,484
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about done with the first half here of episode number 284, our sixth anniversary show.

1110
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:30,132
[SPEAKER_04]: But we could not say goodbye to Part A without taking a moment, as we have for quite a while now here on the program, and paying respect to our elders.

1111
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:36,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do that through a little segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week, where Jamie's going to dig through the archives.

1112
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:46,584
[SPEAKER_04]: and pick a game in the dusty corner of a closet that she thinks needs a little more respect from you kids that were only seven years old when this show started and so on.

1113
01:12:46,664 --> 01:12:49,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, what is this week's classic game of the week?

1114
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game that I literally tripped on this morning in the vault.

1115
01:12:53,086 --> 01:12:54,687
[SPEAKER_01]: It had fallen and I tripped on it.

1116
01:12:55,807 --> 01:13:00,909
[SPEAKER_01]: It's SNK Gauss Fighter, which was on Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000.

1117
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Play some of that music.

1118
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:13,015
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1119
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:21,618
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend over at the local plane trade has one of those and he says he'll sell it to me if I wanted it.

1120
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:24,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't know what I'd do with that.

1121
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:26,480
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a really good version of Puzzle Bobble on it.

1122
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:29,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Puzzle Bobble.

1123
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:31,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only play so many versions of Puzzle Bobble.

1124
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:34,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to keep it in our bathroom.

1125
01:13:34,472 --> 01:13:37,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It has Neo Geo Card Fighters on it.

1126
01:13:38,556 --> 01:13:39,097
[SPEAKER_01]: No thanks.

1127
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:40,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Card Fighters Clash was actually pretty cool.

1128
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:52,270
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you've got basically different SNK female characters, hence SNK Gauss Fighters, that are playable in the game.

1129
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:55,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 2D sort of weird monocolor...

1130
01:13:56,214 --> 01:14:02,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The Neo Geo Pocket Color did not have that great of a color capability, so the characters are pretty monotone.

1131
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:06,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all in SD sprites, so it's pretty cute.

1132
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:14,079
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the characters that are in this game are... You have Mai Shiranui...

1133
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:33,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Athena, Yuri, Leona, Shermie, who I named my cat after, Nakaruru, Shiki, Akari from The Last Blade, Hidden are also Whip from King of Fighters, and Yuki Kushinada from King of Fighters 97, and your boss is Miss X, which I think is funny.

1134
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:39,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, do you remember that Margaret Cho sketch that she talked about being raised by drag queens?

1135
01:14:40,228 --> 01:14:40,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1136
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:42,108
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was named Miss X. Yes.

1137
01:14:42,368 --> 01:14:44,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And Miss X is Iori Agami in drag.

1138
01:14:45,222 --> 01:14:45,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1139
01:14:45,784 --> 01:14:45,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1140
01:14:47,008 --> 01:14:48,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I would share that.

1141
01:14:51,457 --> 01:15:02,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, one of the characters, Yuki, is actually, the one I was mentioning before, is actually Kyo's girlfriend and it's the only game she's ever fought in.

1142
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:17,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a bunch of the other guys make, you know, cameos, like you have Kyo, Ryo, Takuma, Seikenso, and Yashiro, a few other people, so...

1143
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:19,406
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1144
01:15:43,007 --> 01:15:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1145
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:50,893
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in our Part B. And tonight, Listless returns to Orange Lounge Radio.

1146
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:52,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where you guys in chat will have a say.

1147
01:15:52,995 --> 01:16:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Making the definitive list, and this has been a list 10 years in the making, we are going to decide tonight the best Bomani song of the past 10 years.

1148
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:02,322
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going back to our roots a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1149
01:16:02,342 --> 01:16:04,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned for that in Part B of our show.

1150
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:06,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, see you a little later.

1151
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:16,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
