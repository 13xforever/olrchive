Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello everybody out there once again and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio for the 284th time in a row if you've been a long time listener

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you for the next three hours to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How are you?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm here

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Nah, it's all good

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, it's all good?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's all good at Camp Jamie

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm recovering from my milkshake

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Did your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It brought something

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Alright

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It brought gas

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Say hello to as well TechMaster

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're so gross

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Say hello as well to TechMaster Loki

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How would a milkshake bring you gas?

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know, it's just the first thing my toilet brain went to

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alright, I too finished the milkshake

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Did you?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I went and got my, cause I went and stopped by Burger King and I got a large milkshake and a large soda

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And what did it bring you?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Uh, cooling

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Cooling?

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Alright

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, cause I'm not so hot anymore

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Alright, sounds good

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you seriously freaking cold?

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I just, I need like something to cover up while I'm under all of this

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let me introduce, since Loki's already yelling at somebody, he has not been on our show in quite some time

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
About a year

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But he's, well a year is quite some time

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was just quantifying it

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But Miklotov is here tonight

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And Miklotov ran away from our program to go be in Kansas for a little while, right?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Alright

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And he walked into the studio tonight wearing a blanket

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Cause it feels cozy after you eat a lot of food, it's like oh I'm just gonna relax

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I would like to point out it's over a hundred degrees outside here in lovely Sacramento, California

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It feels, this is like a nice blanket, it's not heavy so it feels fine

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But I'm just saying it's like a, it's a hundred degrees outside

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hold on

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And we had to have the lights off before the show to keep it cool in here

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We have like two fans going, the door open to the house

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, we might return the lights off, screw Justin TV, it's not a, it's not a video show

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a shirt underneath

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And shorts

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And now a blanket

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And a blanket

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And why, just because

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because it feels nice

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Because it's, yeah if you eat a lot of food and then you're like oh I'm so stuffed and

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you don't want to move

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It always feels better to just have something that you kind of wrap yourself up in

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Like you were the food and this is your shell, like a tostada or something

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, uh, tell us what you've been up to for the past year, anything exciting?

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hmm, no

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I almost got hit by a tornado

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's, I think that's kind of cool

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's what happens in Kansas, huh?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, it interrupted wow and it wasn't very fun because I had to stop playing wow for

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
a minute

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Gotcha

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And go check on the tornado

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you still in touch, you used to work at the Konami building but then they don't have

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
their offices here in NorCal

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know what you can or can't say about the past or the future

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, I'm working for them as an independent contractor

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ah, very cool

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Can you talk about anything, probably not, huh?

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Stuff

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, it's whatever I always do

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Alright

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You doing stuff?

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As arrows

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, those lights went off

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alright, let's change the topic and talk about our gaming weeks

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We always like to start the show off talking about what we've been playing in our weeks

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and we'll start it off ladies first, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Um, I played Ragnarok and Pinball, as usual

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm still waiting for Dan to bring me back, the world ends with you

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so I have no idea what's going on

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's it

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Alrighty, Loki

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Um, I got an R4 this week so I was playing some DS games

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and I tried playing, um, what was it, uh, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but that game is boring, absolutely boring since it's all in Japanese and I can't read any of it

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm like, seriously, when am I gonna get to the boob poking, okay?

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But, uh, yeah, just, it's, uh, One Trick Pony it seems like

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Um, and then, uh, I tried a bit of, um, Band Brothers

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
which is actually pretty, pretty neat

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Um, a little difficult to figure out how to play it though

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but, um, still a pretty cool music game, it'd be nice to see that brought over here

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Um, then also played, um, Jump Ultra Superstars

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
which, um, I guess people compare it to Smash Brothers a little bit

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I wouldn't say it's quite like Smash Brothers

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's a lot of characters in it for sure and I like how you can, um,

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
kind of combine different pieces of artwork and stuff to, you know, allow you to switch characters

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and add abilities and stuff like that

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So I'd say it's more like Marvel vs. Capcom or something like that

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
which is pretty cool

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And then, um, played a little bit of that Still Live game

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, it's pretty much very similar to the, uh, Flash Portal games

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so if you've played that you, you know, pretty much have played this game as well

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And, um, Point Blank DS because I was trying to find that everywhere

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and no one sold it and just kind of gave up on it

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, Point Blank DS is pretty much, you know, just like Point Blank without a gun

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and just using the stylus and actually pretty fun

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, uh, too bad that that didn't do very well

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then of course on top of all that stuff I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because that's fun

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, what does this device do, this R4, for those that don't know?

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It allows you to run homebrew on your DS and also you can, you know, run ROMs as well

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
for DS games

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Basically it uses a micro SD card and you can throw stuff on there

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's good for, like, playing import stuff, you know, especially if you're just looking to try out a game

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and don't actually plan on buying it

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What the hell is this?

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Aw, I was waiting for the singing to start

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yo ho yo ho, a pirate's life for me, bad joke

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You need to queue up your jokes next time

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Terrible, I know

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Aw, that one would have been better

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm glad to know after six years things still don't work right on this program

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Awesome

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then other, well, I was working on some other things

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I posted a video on Game Trail, because I mean the post-it on the YouTube community we have

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But I forgot how to, so

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, it was like the easiest thing in the world

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It is the easiest thing in the world, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, okay

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So tell us a little bit, because this is kind of exciting

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because Orange Launch Radio hasn't done anything video related

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean, we don't really count just in TV

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean, no offense to just the TV people

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But this is just a camera pointed at people doing a radio show

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's really not that exciting, but you wanted it, so hey

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But this is the first real video thing we've done in a long time

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So tell us a little more about what you did

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I actually finally got my video set up working at home

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Because I've been trying forever to get my damn capture card to work

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And be able to play something at the same time

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It actually involved me bringing back the old TV that was in the arcade cabinet

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Back from work, and putting it on the floor next to my computer

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And actually running it from the game system to the TV

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then the TV to the capture card

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And it actually works perfect that way

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I captured a bunch of footage

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've been playing around with this glitch in Grand Theft Auto 4

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
With an evil swing set

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I put it all to the music of Weapon of Choice

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Edited it together, and it's kind of funny

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I know when he describes it, it doesn't sound that exciting

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I actually watched a video, and I'm not even that big a Grand Theft Auto person

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I know it's a good game and all, but I just don't get into those types of games as much as everyone else

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I kind of laughed, it was really funny, it was well done

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It fit the music so well

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I tried, I spent long hours trying to get it to go with the music

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Making video is a bitch

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've done video for an online game that Shane and I are involved with

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And it's a pain in the ass

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It took me all night to do a two and a half minute video

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, it's a three minute video, and I started with like four hours of video

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I cut it down to three minutes

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I bet the wife loves it

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh yeah, she loves the fact that I'm sitting there doing all that stuff

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, absolutely loves it

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No, and then after I finished that, then I started working on something else

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Which I was hoping to have done today, but it's not

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you'll have to wait

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Can you give us any hints?

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Maybe

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll say something

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Something that people have been asking for for a long, long time

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Loki is making happen

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We'll say that

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Alright

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So so much for your gaming week, is that it?

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why is the Unabomber at our window?

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It looks like it's Andrew, not the Unabomber

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know it's Andrew

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll go next, I didn't even know he was coming

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll go next and talk about my gaming week

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh my god, it's the Unabomber

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hi, how are you?

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Get him on a mic somehow

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, the fourth mic's not hooked up now

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't know you were coming, that's alright

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I wouldn't miss it for the world

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, this is the kind of gems that Justin-

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
See, Justin TV? He does kind of look like the Unabomber

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Alright

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's on your mind?

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Andrew, welcome to the show tonight

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, not much

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You gotta get that mic like right there

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's now working right

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a crazy mic

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're here to celebrate our sixth birthday with us, I'm sure

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Of course

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And your own anniversary is tomorrow, as in your birthday

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How old are you going to be tomorrow?

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Appropriately, I'm going to be 23

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wow, ah, oh my gosh, there's that number of coincidence again

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That got brought up on Bobby's show earlier

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oops

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wow

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That means you were 17 when this show started?

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes, I was

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
God, I'm old

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
God, I am old, alright

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's talk about My Gaming Week

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We'll get back to Andrew later, you can talk about his

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My Gaming Week, I played Warcraft because I'm addicted

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And some other stuff too

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I got into very randomly

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Like, got back into playing Guitar Hero 3

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't even remember why, but I just started, like, hacking at it again

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And some of those songs that were really holding me back

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Like, Knights of Sedonia was a song on hard

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was having a hard time beating

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, I'm still on the hard difficulty, I can't play expert yet

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because there's these triplets in hard mode that are so difficult in that song

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I had the hardest time getting past it, but finally I beat it this week

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then I started playing some other songs too

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I even downloaded the Coldplay pack and the No Doubt pack

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because, I don't know, for some reason

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I enjoy playing Guitar Hero more than I enjoy playing Rock Band

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Which I know is weird

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because you would think, like, Rock Band's kind of the better game

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And in a lot of ways it is

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But since I don't really like to play drums

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I'm not going to sing in my house

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like, especially when nobody's around

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's kind of like a party where I can use alcohol as an excuse

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's, I don't know, there's nothing to play but guitar

254
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And I kind of like the guitar parts in Guitar Hero

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Better than I do Rock Band

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Rock Band gets kind of boring

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Because, I don't know, it's a little closer to the real thing or something

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But Guitar Hero gets all crazy and I like that

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, Rapid Slasher and Chat Room

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com agrees

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That section on Sedonia is tough

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It is tough

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There it is

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Cheeseburger in Chat says

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey Rob, I was 7 when the show started

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because he's 13 now, my god

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm old

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I thought he was listening to the show at 7

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't think he was actually listening when he was 7

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think he just said he was

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Happened to be 7

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Joshie16 in Chat says

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Guitar Hero is more fun alone

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, I kind of agree

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Guitar Hero may not be the better party game

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But it's more fun to play by yourself

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, go figure

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Alright, also in my gaming week

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I bought Space Invaders Extreme for the PSP

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Because I had played a little bit

282
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When Loki had it over here

283
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know, whatever

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He had it on his PSP a while ago

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And I played it and I kind of liked it

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was like, hey, it's like Space Invaders mixed with Rez

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it was kind of cool

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So I decided I was going to get it

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Although, I don't know, it's not really like mixed with Rez

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It just has that same like, upbeat music

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And it kind of feels like a game that would have been made by Q Entertainment

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But it's not

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
My only kind of complaint about the game

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, they made Space Invaders a heck of a lot of fun

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, not only do you have

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know Space Invaders

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Who doesn't know that game by now

298
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But now

299
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Like, not only is it flashy with the graphics in the background

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But the invaders come in little colors

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And you have some red ones

302
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Some green ones

303
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And some blue ones

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And if you shoot four blue ones in a row

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You get one type of weapon

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You shoot red ones in a row

307
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You get another

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And so on

309
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So that's kind of like a challenge-y element to it

310
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you want the good weapon

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So it's like a cross between Space Invaders

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And Raven

313
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, I guess, yeah

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's kind of different

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But the only thing that kind of disappointed me

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now granted, I haven't played the game a whole lot

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or gotten very far

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So it's probably not fair for me to say a whole lot about it right now

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But, I mean, I've played far enough where I've started to notice this

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't notice a lot really change from level to level

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I mean, yeah, the aliens get smarter

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You start to fight these, like, massive aliens

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And one of the coolest things, I think, in the game is the bosses

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like, they actually have boss aliens they have to fight

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Which is kind of cool

326
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And, you know, then you have the little miniature aliens

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But it's still always blue, red, green aliens

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And the same weapon upgrades that you had in level one

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So I was just kind of hoping maybe some of that would change and upgrade as the game goes on

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If it does, I haven't gotten there yet

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And I've gotten to the point where it's starting to feel a little stale

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, you know

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You know, because the original Space Invaders was all white or green aliens

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's been 30 fucking years since the original Space Invaders

335
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It ain't broke

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, but would you spend $20 to buy the original Space Invaders

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Which I think most of us now play as, you know

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, we downloaded the ROM in two seconds to play on MAME

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And we fire it up one time and go

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, yeah, this game, oh, this is fun

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Ah, next game

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Pretty much

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How many people actually sit there and play old school Space Invaders for, like, three hours

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Like they did back in the 80s

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Um

346
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Really?

347
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Really?

348
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
When?

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
About two years ago

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wow

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why?

352
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Were you trying to, like, break it?

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, okay

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I take a little bit of it back because

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I've even found myself on GameTap going back to old Atari 2600 games

356
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That were boring years ago, like Kaboom

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I frickin' played Kaboom for, like, an hour and a half

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Just a couple weeks ago

359
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I could, I guess I could see that

360
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was trying to break my old record, though

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But let's face it

362
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We used to be really, really good at Space Invaders

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's face it, we're a little weird

364
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You should watch King Kong, watch the guy play Crystal Castles with his feet

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I guess that's true

366
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Do you have any interest, then I want to ask you

367
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you have any interest in newer Space Invaders?

368
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Or is it like, oh no, this is bastardizing a classic?

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I would try it

370
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Alright

371
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I mean, I'm open to anything

372
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The new Frogger made me want to throw up

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But I'll give Space Invaders a try

374
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The one on Xbox Live?

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No

376
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That Frogger 2?

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, no, the old new Frogger

379
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The old new Frogger

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, okay

381
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wanna be 3D Frogger?

382
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It made me want to throw up

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I downloaded Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, by the way

384
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The, um

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The, uh, revamped version

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Um

387
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't think it was based on PlayStation 2

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think it's original

389
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Or a PlayStation game

390
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think it's an original game

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Um

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's

393
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There was a Frogger 2, though

394
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's so cute

395
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You want to throw up in your mouth

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But the little hoppy noise gets really irritating

397
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But I only played the demo

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't actually buy the full game

399
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Anyway, that's pretty much it for my gaming week

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Space Invaders

402
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Which is pretty cool

403
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I mean, for 20 bucks

404
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's pretty hard to beat

405
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a good priced game

406
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And, uh

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a

408
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, PSP games are not games you'd usually

409
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I mean, unless you're playing Crisis Core or something

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Not something you spend hours and hours and hours doing

411
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I prefer playing the PSP

412
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
While I'm waiting at the airport for my plane

413
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Or while I'm waiting for something, you know, better to happen in my real life

414
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So Space Invaders is a good short attention span game

415
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I tried playing Crisis Core

416
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That game bores me

417
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Really?

418
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah

419
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
With all the praise and things it's gotten?

420
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's boring

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't know

422
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I tried playing it twice

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Now, I've

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I played it for a good long

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You know, two hour session

426
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Was it, uh, a while ago

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When it first came out

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And then I played it

429
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Some more

430
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like the end of April

431
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
During the plane flight

432
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I just couldn't get into it

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It was so boring

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's just because I think you

436
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Kind of start off at that, like, hub there

437
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And you have little places that you can explore

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But it doesn't really feel like an actual fancy game

439
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It just feels like

440
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Do mission

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Fight people

442
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Go back to the hub

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do mission

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Fight people

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Go back

446
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know

447
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's just very boring for me

448
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay, I gotta go to chatroom

449
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because they're talking about

450
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
A lot about Space Invaders here

451
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Um, GS68 says from Wikipedia

452
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Space Invaders was a very popular video game

453
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That influenced the video game industry

454
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
In Japan, specialty arcades opened with

455
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Nothing but Space Invaders cabinets

456
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The game is considered one of the most

457
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Successful arcade shooting games

458
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Uh, you know, so

459
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We all know that

460
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
People went crazy about the game in Japan

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We know that

462
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Um, it was much bigger over there

463
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Than it was over here

464
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And the Kitsune in chat says

465
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You see Space Invaders everywhere here

466
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They even have Space Invaders plushies in the arcade

467
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That you can win

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That might be kind of cute actually

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I had Space Invader

470
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Um, cell phone charm

471
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
For a while

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Now the original Space Invaders

473
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Can be kind of boring

474
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Continues Kitsune in our chatroom

475
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But I played a newer version

476
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I loved it

477
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And yeah, I, I, I enjoyed

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Space Invaders Extreme

479
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Which is a tiny bit stale

480
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But that's okay, it's a good

481
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Short attention span game

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Kind of like the Gradius collection

483
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't sit there and play Gradius

484
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
For hours and hours either

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Shooters in general

486
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No comment

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Huh?

488
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No comment

489
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Shooters in general to me

490
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Are short attention span games

491
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's just the way I play

492
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I would like a new Gradius game

493
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That was actually really kickass

494
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You know, cause I mean

495
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Gradius 5 was alright

496
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It was pretty cool

497
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But something really like

498
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oomph, like awesome

499
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You need a, somehow like

500
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The universe needs to collide

501
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
A certain way

502
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And Itagaki needs to do

503
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Gradius 6, right?

504
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There wouldn't be a ship

505
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It'd just be him there

506
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Just like

507
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Kicking people over and stuff

508
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Alright

509
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Putting out cigarettes

510
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
On like other ships or something

511
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Let me go over to Miklotov

512
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Who's reading a book

513
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
During our show

514
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I guess we're that exciting

515
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Miklotov, do you have anything

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You want to say about

517
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Your gaming week

518
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Not our gaming week

519
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But yours

520
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
My book is good

521
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know what you're talking about

522
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
First of all

523
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Secondly, all I do is play WoW

524
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Or I play DJ Max on my PSP

525
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So

526
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You need to play DS games

527
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I have a DS with a bunch of games on it

528
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Including imports

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You will play

530
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I play Oh And On 2

531
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And Phoenix Wright games

532
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And that's about it

533
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And Professor Layton

534
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well I have Oh And On 2 on here

535
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have that with me

536
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But it's not my book

537
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And Band Brothers

538
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I have Band Brothers

539
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Band Brothers is a fun game

540
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Tell our listeners about DJ Max

541
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And some of the things you enjoy about it

542
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's better than Beatmania

543
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We have some listeners that really love it

544
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's way better than Beatmania

545
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why

546
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because it's fun

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And it's not insanely stupid sometimes

548
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Unlike Beatmania

549
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Which is insanely stupid most of the time

550
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And it's easy to pick up and go

551
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And the songs are better

552
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it's Korean

553
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So it's better because of that

554
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So in other words

555
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you can't sense

556
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Mikolatov's insane bias

557
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
For Korean based music

558
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And Korean things

559
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because he likes Pump It Up a lot too

560
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah Pump It Up is better than DDR

561
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah see if you can't sense his extreme bias

562
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For all things Korean

563
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then take what he says with the Korean stuff

564
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
How about Tycho No Tatrogen DS

565
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I've not played that

566
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It didn't look good

567
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't like the one in the arcade

568
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I didn't like the one on the Playstation

569
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So I don't think I like the one on the DS

570
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But yeah DJ Max is cool

571
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Because you can customize like

572
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Everything in it

573
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And it's fun

574
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's got stupid videos

575
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah I like the one video with the Power Rangers

576
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Smashing the girls' flowers

577
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The MB Rangers are cool

578
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Is that what it was called?

579
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The MB Rangers?

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah

581
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Funny

582
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's it

583
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Back to book

584
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I like Burning Rangers

585
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Andrew how was your gaming week?

586
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Well I could talk about other games

587
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That are good for 20 bucks

588
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like Hellgate London

589
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Which looks like it's finally out of beta

590
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What six months after release

591
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're working on a 2.0 patch

592
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's an okay Diablo 2 clone

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But it could be better

594
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It could be way way better

595
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Other than that I've been enjoying the free weekend

596
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Of Team Fortress 2

597
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And getting in a little day of defeat

598
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Not much else really

599
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Recently got Brawl and unlocked everything

600
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Within nine hours of opening the box

601
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wow that's dedication

602
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Still haven't got all the achievements though

603
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Still a lot of stuff to do

604
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
People need to register me

605
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
For Brawl by the way

606
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's getting a lot of-

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Do you know your friend code off the top of your head?

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Off the top of my head? No

609
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Thank you Nintendo

610
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm not that dedicated

611
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Just go to the forums

612
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm there

613
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Look at it

614
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Nice plug

615
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

616
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Click on the forums

617
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Thank you

618
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Anything else you've been playing this week?

619
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh that's about it

620
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Besides Brawl and Hellgate

621
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Nothing else

622
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
DJ Ratchet in chat says

623
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And again if you want to join our chat room

624
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

625
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He says

626
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I hope there will eventually be an Elite Beat Agents 2

627
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
As much as it pains me to say at fat chance

628
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And Miklotov's agreeing

629
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Why are you agreeing Miklotov?

630
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Cause like

631
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think

632
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Four people bought it?

633
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I bought it, you bought it

634
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Who else bought Elite Beat Agents?

635
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's it, no

636
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's two, there's half

637
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay, Andrew bought

638
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There's the four right there

639
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Obviously it was more than four people that bought it

640
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But the sad thing is you know like you go to Fry's

641
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Which is a big electronics store here in California

642
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
There were tons and tons of them sitting in the discount bin

643
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think Nintendo just had higher hopes for the game

644
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It just got so discounted so quick

645
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Because like people saw the music list and were like

646
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh it's crappy

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well yeah the music normally would be crappy

648
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But inside the game it was really good

649
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
September with the cutscenes made you feel epic

650
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
September that was the

651
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That was the one about

652
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And she makes the best hamburgers too

653
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I love that one

654
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's a really good one

655
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
See and people just didn't give enough of a chance

656
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's not J-pop so why would they care

657
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Elite Beat Agents

658
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can discount Elite Beat Agents on account of one song

659
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And one song only

660
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And that would be Canned Heat

661
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It was a bad cover

662
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But the story was hilarious

663
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It was a bad cover of a good song with a great story

664
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But it was offbeat

665
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It was not so badly offbeat

666
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh good job, good research Katamari's Forever

667
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Says the actual number of copies sold

668
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
16,000 per VG charts

669
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Wow

670
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's practically 4

671
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I mean when you consider that there's a lot of crappy games

672
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That sell way more than that

673
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's kind of sad

674
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah but 16,000 that's not much bigger than 4

675
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's really not

676
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Not in the scope of things

677
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Not for a video game

678
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's 4 times 4,000

679
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah I was close

680
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I had one number right

681
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Alright

682
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Plus Elite Beat Agents can kind of make you cry

683
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You know because it has the sad stage

684
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There's always the sad stage

685
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Which one had the chris

686
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There was the Christmas one

687
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're the Inspiration

688
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's the one for that game

689
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
All the sad stages are sad except for Oh and Don 1

690
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That one wasn't so sad

691
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But DJ Ratchet's right

692
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You're the Inspiration had some hilarious screw up scenes

693
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It really does

694
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes

695
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Like when you see the dad in like a speedo

696
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That cracked me up

697
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The only thing that was more epic than say September in Oh and Don

698
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Would be doing Ready Steady Go saving the world from a giant meteor

699
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That was so epic it was hilarious

700
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I like Oh and Don 2's epic stage

701
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It was cooler

702
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't even remember what happens

703
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But I just remember I liked the song better

704
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And it was more fun to play

705
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
By the way spoilers for a music game

706
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's alright

707
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I was just realizing is it really 16,000 or is it 160,000

708
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It can't be 16,000

709
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There's no way

710
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Let me look hold on

711
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It has to be 160

712
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm going to look

713
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
America

714
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll find the answer

715
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
While we get into other stuff throughout the show

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If it is 16,000

717
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah there's a reason right there

718
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Why we'll never get one

719
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Cause I'm thinking like

720
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
God I have Judgement sold more than that game

721
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's sad

722
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Alright

723
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Housekeeping tonight

724
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Tonight is our sixth anniversary show

725
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yay

726
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Orange launch

727
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Can I get a yay

728
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yay

729
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Alright

730
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Orange launch radio started on June 23, 2008

731
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And it was about as exciting as this episode

732
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Allgames.com relaunched this week

733
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They have a whole new look

734
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Check it out

735
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
www.allgames.com

736
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That is of course the site

737
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Where we broadcast from every Sunday Night Live

738
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
If you've only ever listened to us on your iPod

739
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Or other type of portable device like PSP

740
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What have you

741
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You're subscribing to our feed

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Check us out live sometime

743
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Sunday nights

744
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We tape at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

745
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
9 o'clock Eastern

746
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Just like

747
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I want to say Dreadlock Lord in chat

748
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Is joining us for the first time

749
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think he was saying before the show

750
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So welcome

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Be cool like him

752
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Come listen to a new show

753
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And I wanted to say

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Thanks to me going back

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And playing Guitar Hero 3 this week

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I actually thought to check

757
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
On the Guitar Hero OL Army

758
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And I had to go back

759
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And approve requests to join

760
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
From like February

761
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So if I neglected to add you to the OL Army

762
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You're there now

763
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And if you want to join the OL Army

764
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Go to the Guitar Hero community site

765
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And search for OLRMY

766
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And you too can join our Guitar Hero OL Army

767
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Which I promise I will update more than once

768
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Every four months

769
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Also if you missed it in part B last week

770
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We had a pretty cool announcement

771
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Joining us next week on the program

772
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Tommy Tallarico will be here

773
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
For an extended interview

774
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Where he's going to talk about video games live

775
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And his involvement with GANG

776
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Which is a big audio guild

777
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
For people that are into making audio for games

778
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Whether they're already doing it

779
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or just have an interest in it

780
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And more video games live

781
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Because it's what lots of people

782
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Are talking about right now

783
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Tommy's going to be here to join us

784
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Talk a lot about that

785
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's pretty cool

786
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll be next week here on Orange Lounge Radio

787
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But for tonight

788
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Since this is the sixth anniversary

789
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

790
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
We do have some special things planned

791
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
For you in part B

792
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We're going to bring back

793
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
These segments

794
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
From OLR's history

795
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And one of them is going to be music game related

796
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
We're going to do a list list in part B tonight

797
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And it does have to do with music games

798
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So that'll be pretty exciting

799
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Especially for our long time listeners

800
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Who remember our roots

801
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
For now though

802
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Gaming news throughout the gaming world

803
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We'll start it off with Loki

804
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yes, this week we had a brand new firmware update

805
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
For the PSP

806
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And it didn't really add a whole lot

807
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Except for the ability to search on Google

808
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Straight from the cross media bar

809
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And also the other thing that they added along with that

810
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Was now that you can change the viewing speed

811
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
During video playback

812
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
By pressing the up and down buttons

813
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
While you're watching a video

814
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yay

815
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And I'm sure they also tried to fix some other holes

816
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
That were opened up

817
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Allowing people to run homebrew and stuff

818
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And I know that they're already working on custom firmware 4.0

819
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So

820
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah

821
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That doesn't work

822
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Why is it that they're calling it 4.0?

823
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Probably because they had so many updates

824
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That were getting close to 4.0 anyways

825
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's like 3.96 and stuff

826
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Might as well just go 4.0

827
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because I guess they would consider the internet search function

828
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
As a brand new feature or something like that

829
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Instead of just a little update

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So

831
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't know, I think they're just running out of numbers

832
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Okay

833
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Going back to Elite Beat Agents for a minute

834
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Because this news about the 4.0 firmware kind of bores me

835
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Because they really didn't do much to call this 4.0

836
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I was expecting something a little more landmark

837
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Going back to Elite Beat Agents

838
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It actually sold.17 million

839
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Which would be 170,000 copies

840
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Not 16,000

841
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That must have been just in the first week or something

842
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yay, that's still not enough to get another game

843
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And that's also still not as much as

844
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Eye of Judgment, right?

845
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But that is only released though in two regions though

846
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So you have to also count

847
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Whatever

848
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Owen Dunn

849
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Eye of Judgment has sold.21 million copies

850
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Granted, that's worldwide

851
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It didn't sell better than Crysis

852
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Let's see

853
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Comparing it to some other games

854
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Let's see, Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses

855
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, we don't have sales data for that

856
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Let's see, what are some of these other ones?

857
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Maybe I can find

858
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Ah, there we go

859
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Barbie Island Princess on the DS

860
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
.14 million copies

861
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's only 30,000 less than Owen Dunn

862
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
How about Elite Beat Agents?

863
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

864
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

865
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

866
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Not in the database

867
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Awesome, it's so crappy it's not even there

868
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What about Imagine Babies?

869
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Oh wait, I found Let's Ride Friends Forever

870
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Imagine Babies? You'd be surprised

871
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's actually in the top selling

872
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
DS titles

873
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I honestly don't understand

874
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Wow, wow, wow, get this

875
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you know how many copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever

876
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
sold in its first week of release?

877
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No

878
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
986

879
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Ok, I'm sorry

880
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So yeah, you're about

881
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What is it?

882
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
200 or

883
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
211,000

884
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
copies now of Eye Judgment

885
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Ok, wow

886
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Wow

887
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Ok, thank god

888
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm sorry

889
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Elite Beat Agents

890
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
170,000 copies, right?

891
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Imagine Babies, you ready for this?

892
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
1.85 million copies

893
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
have sold

894
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's per VGCharts.com

895
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That makes sense though

896
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's seriously, it's weird

897
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
People buy it for their little girls

898
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Cause they want them to know how to raise their babies

899
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's absolutely weird, that game right there

900
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
is like, seriously up in the top

901
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
of the DS charts and also

902
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Imagine Fashion Designer is up there too

903
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Ok, iVal

904
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Since I own the game thanks to somebody

905
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
in this room

906
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm going to play Imagine Babies

907
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
this week

908
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Come back and report on it

909
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You better be good on it

910
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Also, Breaking a Million copies sold

911
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Happy Cooking

912
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
How many did Cookie Mama sell?

913
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Last one

914
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Cookie Mama

915
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Elite Beat Agents sold 170,000

916
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Cookie Mama sold 2.74 million copies

917
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What about Cookie Mama 2? Cause I don't think that did as well

918
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Cookie Mama 2

919
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
1.19 million, keep in mind these are worldwide numbers

920
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Crazy

921
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Alright, I'm done

922
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Thank god I wasn't like

923
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Imagine Babies, no one will buy that

924
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's just add that to the thing

925
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, see, I'm smart

926
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You are very smart

927
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's a good thing you didn't take that as part of the bet

928
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Alright, let's see

929
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Sony planning a clamp down on PSP

930
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Pirating

931
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's right, there is a piracy problem

932
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
on the PSP

933
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
said Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe

934
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
President David Reeves

935
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And we know about it

936
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We know how it's done

937
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So basically they know how to

938
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
log on to any of the many blogs out there

939
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that specifically talk about PSP hacking

940
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Right, they're gonna really clamp down on PSP piracy

941
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
These were quotes from

942
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Sony's Devastation

943
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Developer Conference

944
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
that was held in London

945
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And it's not all bad news

946
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
because

947
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
sometimes piracy, says

948
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
David Reeves,

949
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
fuels the growth of hardware sales

950
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So people

951
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
buy PSP, and you know what, I actually kind of see that

952
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
because a lot of people bought the PSP

953
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
when they found out that they were able to

954
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
play NES games on them

955
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's kind of true

956
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I know a lot of people that when they first got them, that's all they did

957
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They had me put emulators on there for them

958
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and they played NES games

959
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
One of my friends went right out and bought one and then modded his battery

960
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Here's one thing to

961
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
note though, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up

962
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
He went on to say that

963
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
there are plans going on

964
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that will crack down on the numbers

965
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
of pirates out there, but

966
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
There is nothing they can do, absolutely

967
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
nothing, they have said this forever

968
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and they have tried different methods

969
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and it's slowed people down

970
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
but then eventually they come back around

971
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and they find a new way about it

972
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You have no chance, make your time

973
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's just like

974
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
we're gonna get to another story about another system later

975
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and the same damn thing is going on there

976
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's ridiculous

977
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
People, I wish they would learn

978
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
there is nothing they can do

979
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
because as soon as they make

980
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
more of a bigger deal about it

981
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
that's when people start finding out about it

982
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and then they start, oh hey I can do that now

983
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I didn't know

984
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
When was the last time that you heard about

985
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
hacking being done on the Playstation 3?

986
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I've heard of them

987
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
actually trying things

988
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
but they still haven't gotten anything to work yet

989
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If I'm not mistaken, Playstation 3 has a more

990
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
don't give a shit attitude towards like

991
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
installing Linux on it and all that stuff

992
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's why people don't care

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
People are looking

994
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to find ways to run homebrew stuff

995
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
on it, I think mainly

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
they're trying to find ways to pirate stuff

997
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
but even stuff, even let's just say

998
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you were able to pirate games on the PS3

999
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
it's not really

1000
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
as easy because

1001
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
if you dump a Playstation 3 game

1002
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
that's upwards to 50 gigs

1003
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you're only going to be able to

1004
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
throw one or two on your hard drive

1005
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
at a time

1006
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
it's just more cumbersome

1007
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
just say forget it

1008
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and they'll do it on the 360 instead

1009
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Before we get to our next story

1010
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
a comment from chat, Amaze Satsuma in chat

1011
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
says there is one way to stop pirates

1012
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
send ninjas out to kill them

1013
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
There you have it

1014
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But you know what though

1015
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
there are ninjas that are

1016
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
you know, acting in

1017
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
they're participating in

1018
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
piracy actually, there's the Wii Ninja

1019
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
which is a mod chip

1020
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
for the Wii that allows you to play pirated games

1021
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Sairan

1022
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in chat says what is a pirate

1023
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
a miserable little pile of hacks

1024
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
but enough talk

1025
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
have at you

1026
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
please save us from this

1027
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
nonsense in our chat room

1028
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
while we get to another story

1029
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Rob, you killed it

1030
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Hey, I didn't say it, Sairan said it

1031
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Do I gotta?

1032
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, some news about the MMO that

1033
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
BioWare is

1034
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
squirting out

1035
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
they said that it's supposed to be out

1036
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
between April 2010 and

1037
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
April 2011

1038
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
um

1039
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
well

1040
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
the article actually said

1041
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
that EA was funding an MMO

1042
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
but EA owns BioWare

1043
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and it's in Austin

1044
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
so that's where they got the information from

1045
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and um

1046
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
there's no more uh

1047
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
information exactly about what it's gonna be

1048
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
but the theory is Knights of the Old Republic

1049
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
so

1050
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
hmm

1051
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
possible

1052
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
hmm, that could be interesting

1053
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
hmm, you say

1054
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
anyways

1055
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
there's gonna be some pretty interesting

1056
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
stuff coming out about Resistance 2

1057
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of course just recently they had some gameplay

1058
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
videos that were premiering on

1059
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
GameTrailersTV and

1060
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
now GamePro has

1061
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the scoop on some more stuff including

1062
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
they're gonna be giving out

1063
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
in random issues of GamePro

1064
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
free Resistance 2 beta codes

1065
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
so you'll be able to get in on

1066
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
the beta for that and they're hoping to sell

1067
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
a few more magazines with that as well cause

1068
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know about you but I don't think GamePro's

1069
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
doing that great right now. And there's some people

1070
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
out there that would buy like 10 copies to get a

1071
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
golden ticket quote unquote right? Yeah pretty

1072
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
much. Did they say about how many of the magazines

1073
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
are gonna have this? Nope.

1074
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Interesting. But they were saying that

1075
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
there's tons of juicy

1076
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
stuff in there and they're saying

1077
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
it's bigger than Halo

1078
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
bigger than Call of Duty

1079
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm sorry though or you know

1080
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
better than Halo they said

1081
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
a lot of things are better than Halo

1082
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
unfortunately

1083
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but Resistance 2

1084
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
is gonna be awesome. Resistance 1 was

1085
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
absolutely cool. If you loved

1086
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Call of Duty and you want more of a

1087
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
sci-fi game this is perfect

1088
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
for you.

1089
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Of course and I don't think it made tonight's show

1090
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
roll but I want to say something I read something about

1091
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Call of Duty 6 is supposed to be like sci-fi

1092
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
related. Is that a response

1093
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
to this? No I would think

1094
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
they're just getting

1095
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
they're trying to mix it up a bit but

1096
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
you know I don't know if that

1097
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
worked really well for Battlefield

1098
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
2142 either though because

1099
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
they tried to mix it up a bit and go a little sci-fi

1100
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and futuristic you know

1101
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Tom Clancy's been doing that or

1102
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
the Tom Clancy series I guess

1103
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
you know with Hawks and

1104
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
End War and that kind of stuff but

1105
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you know I honestly

1106
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
think that Resistance 2 is gonna be awesome. Resistance

1107
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I absolutely out of the first person shooters I've played

1108
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Gears of War, Halo 3

1109
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
just

1110
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
a lot of them out there

1111
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Resistance was my favorite

1112
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
absolutely which is weird because you know

1113
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
usually I'm not too favorable on

1114
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
stuff for the Playstation 3

1115
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but you know it honestly is a good game

1116
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and I'm definitely buying the next one

1117
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Alright

1118
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm just kinda reading

1119
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
some other crazy stuff in chat

1120
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
DJ Ratchet speculates

1121
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it ends up only 5 game pros have it

1122
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
so it actually does turn into

1123
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Willy Wonka. Well they're assuming that's gonna be over

1124
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
60 since they're

1125
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
obviously gonna be stress testing

1126
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
servers so you know

1127
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
there's gonna be 60 player online with

1128
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Resistance 2. Will there be more

1129
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Resistance 2 beta keys than

1130
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
copies of Elite Beat Agents sold?

1131
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't think so.

1132
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Alright I promise no more

1133
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
sales figures but I lied

1134
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
cause this is actually something a little more current

1135
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 should be noted

1136
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that Fumitsu Magazine has

1137
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
reported that over in Japan

1138
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
since Fumitsu Magazine is in Japan

1139
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
476,334

1140
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
copies were sold

1141
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
in the first week

1142
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and

1143
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
by the way 77,208

1144
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
consoles

1145
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
were sold that week and that is

1146
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
like if you kinda do the math there that's

1147
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
what about like 1 in 4

1148
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
no 1 in 5?

1149
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
so like 1 out of every 5

1150
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
copies of the game sold also

1151
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
pushed a console. That's pretty

1152
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
big. There you have it

1153
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
over in the UK

1154
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
cause 1 out of every 5

1155
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
copies was probably one of those

1156
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
consoles that included the

1157
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
game with it possibly

1158
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
over in the UK it should be noted that

1159
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 well it sold well it did not

1160
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
do quite as well as Grand Theft Auto

1161
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
4. It was 14,000

1162
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
copies short

1163
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
of the Metal Gear Solid 2 release

1164
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in 2002

1165
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
See I have a bad feeling

1166
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
that they're gonna start really

1167
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
budging their numbers with

1168
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
oh yeah look how many consoles this

1169
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
game pushed. Well yeah because

1170
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you're including it with all the consoles. Of course

1171
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
it's gonna be

1172
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
kind of equal with

1173
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
the console sales. You know

1174
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
what though? We even know people that have

1175
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
went out and bought a Playstation 3 just for this

1176
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
game. Yeah I could believe it.

1177
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean it's an awesome game.

1178
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But then again when Final Fantasy 13 comes out

1179
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I will probably buy a Playstation 3 just

1180
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
for that game so what can you do? Well don't worry

1181
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
about that time you know the Playstation 4

1182
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
will be coming out so. Hurray!

1183
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Plus maybe Sony

1184
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Home I'll actually have to play as well

1185
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah I'm sure it'll eventually be

1186
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
out in beta form of course.

1187
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well

1188
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
for other news if

1189
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
anyone's been interested

1190
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
in LittleBigPlanet

1191
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
the Sony experience is coming

1192
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
by on a bunch of trucks

1193
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
that has different kiosks

1194
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
with games in it such as

1195
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Turismo 5 Prologue, Metal Gear Solid 4

1196
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and PSP games

1197
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and it's traveling all over

1198
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
the country so if you go to

1199
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
us.playstation.com

1200
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
you can find links to

1201
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
tour dates there. Do you happen to have the dates

1202
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
in front of you by chance? I was just wondering if there's

1203
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
anything local where you can go crash. There's

1204
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
very few tour dates.

1205
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's alright.

1206
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So not a big tour right now. No it's like

1207
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
each truck's doing like four different

1208
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
cities and that's it. Huh.

1209
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Actually I have

1210
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
three locations according to this one.

1211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And that's just Baltimore

1212
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and Milwaukee. But maybe

1213
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
more to come. Maybe.

1214
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Cause when that Rock Band tour

1215
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
started didn't they only have a few dates and then

1216
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
finally it like exploded into like all

1217
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
these places before the game came out. Okay here we go.

1218
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Oh yes. The

1219
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
PlayStation Patrol tour

1220
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
is going to Davenport

1221
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Iowa, Huntsville Alabama.

1222
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I should go visit my family. No.

1223
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Trevor City Michigan and

1224
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
New York City.

1225
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Why they gotta hate the West Coast?

1226
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Not a single

1227
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
West Coast date in there.

1228
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But the New York City date is July 11th

1229
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
through July 15th so if any of our listeners

1230
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
get the urge go check it out

1231
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
for us. Yeah and please go ask them why they hate

1232
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
us so much on the West Coast. Oh.

1233
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
They were probably

1234
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
already here and I didn't even care.

1235
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
They've

1236
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
been here before. They usually come to our

1237
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
local sunrise fall every now and then.

1238
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But you know we had the signing of the

1239
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Metreon right? Yes that's true.

1240
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I didn't see no

1241
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
little big planet there.

1242
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I just saw you know. Who cares about Metal Gear Solid?

1243
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's all about little big planets.

1244
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm no longer falling.

1245
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Alright go

1246
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
follow the tour bus or something

1247
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
and if you happen to go you know

1248
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
take a camera or something and tell us about

1249
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
your experience. Anyways there was a whole

1250
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
bunch of drama last week with

1251
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Itagaki leaving Tecmo

1252
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and Team Ninja behind.

1253
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I am surprised he did not tip over

1254
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
everything on his way out.

1255
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
If he has we probably just

1256
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
haven't heard it yet. Exactly he probably

1257
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
just you know threw a manager through a window

1258
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
and then jumped down you know.

1259
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
While setting the building on fire and

1260
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
it just blew up behind him in like an elaborate

1261
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
explosion. See that's the thing

1262
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
is you know he does it in style.

1263
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Everything. Everything he does.

1264
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Anyways

1265
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
so they have

1266
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
served a gag

1267
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
order for him to

1268
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
basically not disclose or

1269
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
leak any Tecmo trade

1270
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
secrets and you know

1271
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
make any false or misleading statements

1272
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
etc. etc. The only problem is though

1273
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
it hasn't been signed off by the court yet so he's

1274
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
talking now.

1275
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah so Itagaki put out a press statement

1276
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
of his own that says you don't tell me to shut the fuck

1277
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
up.

1278
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I come back and kill you again.

1279
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I do what I want.

1280
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Now his his his press

1281
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
statement when it was faxed out it was

1282
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
just a big middle finger.

1283
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And then it burst into fire.

1284
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Because he's that awesome.

1285
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
He's such a rock star.

1286
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I bet it was on paper that's

1287
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
flammable as soon as it opened.

1288
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Have we had the

1289
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
burning finger. Have we had the concept

1290
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
on this show before to have a

1291
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
game where you just you are Itagaki.

1292
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I mean this would be a great

1293
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
now like like before it's like where what

1294
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
could the game be like you know oh you're

1295
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
just you're Itagaki you sleep with chicks you burn

1296
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
hotel rooms down understand now

1297
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
now we have a purpose because he got kicked

1298
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
out of Tecmo now you got now you have

1299
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
good motives yes and

1300
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
motive well there could definitely be a game here.

1301
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
We're going to elevate him to a

1302
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Chuck Norris status you know he's going to

1303
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
be immortal at some point.

1304
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
He is the Chuck Norris of game designers really.

1305
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Anyways

1306
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Itagaki. He laughs at Chuck Norris.

1307
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yes.

1308
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
He doesn't have to do anything better than Chuck

1309
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Norris because you think Chuck Norris is fucking funny.

1310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Of course Tecmo

1311
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
the man denies that

1312
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Team Ninja is actually leaving them

1313
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and also

1314
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
kind of denying different aspects about the lawsuit.

1315
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
One of the things that they say

1316
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
was inaccurate was that all of the

1317
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
employees were suing

1318
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Tecmo. Well

1319
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
yes and no it's actually two employees suing

1320
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Tecmo on behalf of

1321
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
all the other employees so

1322
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'd like some sort of convoluted class

1323
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
action. Yeah there's a whole lot of weird

1324
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
stuff going on there. Japanese law is

1325
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
kind of funny anyway. Not paying overtime

1326
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and that kind of thing you know.

1327
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I don't know.

1328
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Is this why you know

1329
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Tecmo Bowl is just

1330
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
taking forever to come out. Team Ninja doesn't do

1331
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Tecmo Bowl. I understand. Team Ninja should

1332
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
do Tecmo Bowl.

1333
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Ninja Bowl

1334
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
that'll be fun.

1335
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Rob do you remember Battle Chess?

1336
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh yeah hell yeah. Where they would like

1337
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
kill each other and everything. That was awesome.

1338
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They should have like battle football.

1339
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
All right.

1340
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Well listen this is what

1341
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Itagaki's new job is going to be

1342
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
okay.

1343
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Basically if you imagine

1344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
you know like a kitchen

1345
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
stadium except it's not

1346
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
a kitchen stadium it's just a

1347
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
stadium with Itagaki being

1348
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the chairman and he has people fight each

1349
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
other to the death with a secret weapon

1350
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
that is revealed on each show.

1351
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I like it.

1352
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So Itagaki should not be so worried

1353
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
about this divorce from Tecmo because he will be

1354
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
a rock star elsewhere. Oh yeah they'll pick him up

1355
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that Microsoft will probably have him work

1356
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
for him.

1357
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Nice.

1358
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Meanwhile in another part of the galaxy

1359
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Sony is

1360
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
they're kind of fiddling

1361
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
with this whole idea of getting into the

1362
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
gaming phone.

1363
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You know especially because

1364
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Apple you know you heard them at the

1365
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
conference a couple weeks ago they announced

1366
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
you know that the iPhone is expanding into more

1367
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and more gaming outlets when they showed the

1368
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
pictures of Monkey Ball and all this stuff.

1369
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It looks like

1370
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Sony might be getting into gaming a little more

1371
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
themselves. It's Sony Ericsson

1372
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
F30

1373
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
or 05 the F305

1374
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is this new model of Sony Ericsson

1375
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
it kind of sort of like

1376
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
has this giant screen on it that's iPhone

1377
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
ish. But here's the thing that's interesting

1378
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
about it. There's a up down

1379
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
left right little control maneuver. Okay

1380
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
well whatever you probably seen those on the phone although that looks

1381
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
kind of like a game controller. But the buttons

1382
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
are also labeled X and O just

1383
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
kind of like you would have on a Playstation

1384
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
controller. And

1385
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the system here little Sony Ericsson

1386
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
comes with games on it.

1387
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Bowling bash fishing

1388
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and jockey and it

1389
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
all of them use an accelerometer

1390
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
that is actually located inside

1391
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the device as well. Why in the hell does

1392
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
your phone need an accelerometer. I'm not sure

1393
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
unless like it knows to shut off

1394
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
if it's falling out of your pocket or something

1395
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I don't know. But

1396
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
it does have one in it.

1397
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Or if it senses that you're falling

1398
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
for a long time it's like you're falling

1399
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
to your death. Do you wish to call loved ones.

1400
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yes or no.

1401
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh nice.

1402
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It shouldn't

1403
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
ask you yes or no because all it's going to get is

1404
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
it's

1405
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
all it's going to get

1406
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
because I think if you're falling out of a plane

1407
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
your death you're not going to have time to say oh

1408
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
yes. Hey I don't know

1409
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
are you trying to tell me though that

1410
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
no wait I mean cake

1411
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
are

1412
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
you trying to tell me that crank was

1413
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
fake. That movie was fake

1414
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that he couldn't like fall out of

1415
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
a helicopter and have time to call his loved

1416
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
one on the cell phone and then land and

1417
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
die. It

1418
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
was fake in the movie but it was real

1419
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
when it got he did it

1420
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
said he landed and he's like fuck this

1421
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm too cool to die and then shot the

1422
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
plane down. All right.

1423
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
All

1424
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
right. Well how

1425
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
about some completely innocent and happy

1426
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
news. No

1427
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Disney

1428
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
this makes me kind of

1429
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I just think it's funny because I'm going to have to

1430
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
draw the parallel okay.

1431
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Disney is making a

1432
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
game about a dog

1433
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
who shoots laser beams

1434
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
from his eyes and

1435
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
barks with a sonic boom. Wait a minute

1436
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I think I've heard

1437
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
of this game before.

1438
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What. Go ahead continue on.

1439
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's an animated movie.

1440
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And his owner is called Penny

1441
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
who besides me is thinking

1442
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Inspector Gadget.

1443
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm sorry brain is not that cool.

1444
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Okay but

1445
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
it's a girl named Penny who

1446
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
who hacks. She's a hacker.

1447
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is Inspector Gadget

1448
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
but with the cooler dog. Little kids are not

1449
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
hackers. It's like you mix

1450
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Inspector Gadget and the dog and

1451
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
give him John Travolta's voice. Wait I have a

1452
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
question for the nerdy wait

1453
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I have a question for nerdy

1454
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Power Girl is like is she a girl dressed up like

a Duracell battery or something I have to

1548
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Power Girl is actually Super

1549
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Girl from a different universe so she's exactly

1550
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the same person as Supergirl that has these humongous

1551
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
boobs that's like the only difference

1552
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Big Breasted Universe I can dig that

1553
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
anyways they're also saying

1555
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
that there's

1556
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
a possible two game deal

1557
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
boobies look at that

1560
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
no look at the picture that Alex Ross

1561
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000

1562
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000

Unlimited that's the stupid cartoon

1564
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
well she does not have big boobies there

1565
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000

1566
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000

1567
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
stuffed down her shirt and that one

1568
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
look at Power Girl and Alex

1569
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Ross and look at that that's the picture he did

1570
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000

picked for the game I mean

1577
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Robin I've heard of Wonder Woman I've heard

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
you've named I've heard of Power Girl

1580
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000

1582
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000

1590
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Google image search they've got

1591
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000

1592
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000

1593
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000

00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000

1595
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
massive approval

1596
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Loki had you ever heard

1597
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
of Power Girl before tonight

1598
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
nope

1599
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
but now you'll never forget

1600
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
no I probably will alright

1601
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm not a big

1602
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I've made no secret of it that I'm not

1603
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
the world's biggest DC fan

1604
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
but I've got characters I like

1605
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and I like her because she's bitchy

1606
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
she's fair

1607
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and she's got boobs

1608
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
hitstun says Harley Quinn

1609
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
was the first character I made in Soul Calibur 3

1610
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
in the create your own character mode

1611
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I think the first character I made

1612
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
was a totally naked person wearing

1613
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
a bishop's hat

1614
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that did like capoeira dancing

1615
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
or something it was crazy

1616
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
alright

1617
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
anyhow I have no idea

1618
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
how to segue into this story

1619
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
so I will just say the ESRB

1620
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
is sadly going to

1621
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
probably no longer be

1622
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
leaking game announcements early

1623
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
cause you know we find out about all these cool games

1624
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
cause they show up on the ESRB's website

1625
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
there was Earthbound coming to the Wii

1626
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
we found out about that early

1627
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Castlevania

1628
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the full name of that game

1629
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
why are you still laughing Loki

1630
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
so speaking of big boobs

1631
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I hear giggling in my right ear

1632
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
oh it's Andrew

1633
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
he started off a joke

1634
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and I don't know where it's going

1635
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
is it from the toilet paper book

1636
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I was going to say though

1637
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
yeah it sucks that the ESRB

1638
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
wait wait I didn't even say why

1639
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
let me finish the story

1640
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
now

1641
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
when these companies submit the games to get the rating

1642
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
they can actually fill in a date

1643
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
when the title will be uploaded

1644
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
on the ESRB's website

1645
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
if the company for whatever reason doesn't fill it out

1646
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
though it will automatically

1647
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
go on the website 30 days after it's rated

1648
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
so basically companies can now choose

1649
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
what date the game will go on the website

1650
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
but the ESRB is saying don't abuse this

1651
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
which is kind of interesting

1652
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
in the memo that went out about this

1653
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
quote the ESRB system will not work for consumers

1654
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
if publishers arbitrarily

1655
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
select dates bearing no reasonable

1656
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
relationships to consumers interest

1657
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
in the product

1658
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
but it should be noted this would still have

1659
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
no effect on some of the other ways that games

1660
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
have been leaked through official agencies

1661
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
such as the OFLC in Australia

1662
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
exactly

1663
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
now Loki

1664
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
you had a comment

1665
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
that's exactly what I was going to say

1666
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
well that doesn't stop everybody else from doing it

1667
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and besides you know

1668
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
there's a lot of other ways to find out about leaked dates

1669
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
but you don't know of any of them right?

1670
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
of course not

1671
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
alright well you know what

1672
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't know about you guys but I kind of liked

1673
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
when the ESRB would leak things early

1674
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and now I feel like I'm going to be sitting in the dark

1675
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
until they want me to know about released dates

1676
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and I like ruining Christmas

1677
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I like finding out about stuff early

1678
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
so this ESRB news

1679
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
kind of makes me a little bit angsty

1680
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and when I get angsty we cue the FU music

1681
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
music

1682
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
just a massive FU

1683
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
to the assholes

1684
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
on the Ragnarok server I play on

1685
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
who are duplicating items

1686
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and selling them and basically

1687
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
doing a whole bunch of shit that's now

1688
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I wouldn't say it's completely ruined everything

1689
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but it's made things difficult for other people

1690
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
so

1691
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:54,000
FU to them

1692
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I have two FUs of the week

1693
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
my first FU goes to me

1694
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
for spending $10 to go watch The Happening

1695
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
which was horrible

1696
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
and not even like so bad it was good

1697
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
like Showgirls

1698
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
you know bad

1699
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
but it was just bad

1700
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
it was really really bad

1701
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
my other FU goes to the fact

1702
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
this is a much bigger FU

1703
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
my other FU goes to the fact that I had to have not just one

1704
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
but two MRIs last week

1705
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I went in for an MRI

1706
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
if you've been listening to this show the past three months

1707
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I've been having issues with my pancreas

1708
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
that kept me out a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital

1709
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
blah blah blah cry me a river

1710
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
but I was having a follow up appointment to check on my pancreas

1711
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
on Thursday I had an MRI

1712
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and I don't know if you've ever had an MRI done

1713
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
but if you have to drink this really nasty stuff

1714
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
before you have an MRI

1715
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
it's wretched

1716
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
this barium stuff is wretched

1717
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
they were probably trying to eliminate your pancreas

1718
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
well no

1719
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
it's not so much that

1720
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
it's horrible but having to leave work early

1721
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
go to this place or whatever

1722
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
so I went in on Thursday had it done

1723
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
they called me at five o'clock at night

1724
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
oh Rob the thing that your doctor

1725
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
wanted to see doesn't come out

1726
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
clear in our MRI thing

1727
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
because we have an older MRI thing out here in Folsom

1728
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
we need you to go to our Roseville office

1729
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
where they have a newer MRI machine

1730
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
things you could have told me about

1731
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
the first time

1732
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
it wasn't written on there what my doctor was looking for

1733
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
or nothing I mean if you didn't think it was going to come up on the old one

1734
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
why didn't you just tell me to go to the new place to start with

1735
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
instead of making me miss two days of work

1736
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and have to drink that nasty nasty stuff twice

1737
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
so

1738
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
but anyway I'm hoping the MRIs

1739
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
show that I'm healthy again

1740
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
because otherwise I'll be filled with more FUs

1741
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and nobody wants that

1742
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Andrew

1743
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
first of all FU to GameStop

1744
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
for closing at six on Sundays

1745
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I was going to go in and

1746
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
apparently they were giving away deoxys

1747
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
at GameStop all weekend

1748
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
just missed by two minutes

1749
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
D'oh!

1750
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
FU to the community

1751

1755
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
easy pickings were heavy though

1756
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and FU to Hellgate

1757
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
for being such a bitch and a half to install

1758
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
alrighty

1759
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
that's going to do it

1760
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
then for our FUs of the week

1761
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Miek LaTov left

1762
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
the room, I guess he

1763
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
finished the book so he had to go find something else to do

1764
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
alright so

1765
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000

01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
set of the SimCity games

1823
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000

1826
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
for another strategy game, Supreme Commander

1827
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
on Xbox 360

1828
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and on the

1829
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
DS, Mega Man Star Force

1830
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000

1831
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
and Zerker X Ninja

1832
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
those are going to be coming to the DS

1833
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
WALL-E

1834
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000

the Wii, the DS, and the PSP

1837
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
of course because the movie comes out

1838
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
this week as well

1839
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000

1840
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and PS3

01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
My Weight Loss Coach on the DS

1842
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
which includes a free pedometer

1843
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
it's neat

1844
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
kind of interesting

1845
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'll give it, it's different

1846
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
it's not a bad thing

1847
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
that the fitness craze has taken over

1848
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
in the video game world right now

1849
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
better than nothing

1850
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Gourmet Chef for the DS

1851
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
which is a cookbook type of game

1852
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and also has a

1853
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
cooking sim portion of it

1854
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000

on the 360

1857
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
which looks pretty awesome

1858
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Hellboy the Science of Evil on PSP

1859
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1860
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
on the DS

1861
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
this is a long-awaited

1862
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
favorite Final Fantasy Tactics

1863
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Advance 2

1864
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
or A2

1865
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
also we have coming out

1866
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
quite a bit of things

1867
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2

1868
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000

on the Wii

1871
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The Midnight Play Pack on the DS

1872
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
which I think is a bunch of cell phone games

1873
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Code Lyoko Fall of

1874
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Rosanna on the DS

1875
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Overlord Raising Hell

1876
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
on the PS3 which is just

1877
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Overlord and all the other expansions for that

1878
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Let's see here

1879
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Elements on the

1880
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
PC

1881
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and

1882
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I think there's one other thing I missed here

1883
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Let's see here

1884
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Cake Mania 2 on the DS

1885
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Deadliest Catch

1886
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Alaskan Storm on

1887
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Xbox 360 if you want to

1888
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
be a crab fisher I guess

1889
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Guitar Hero

1890
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Aerosmith that's coming out on

1891
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Playstation 2, Xbox 360

1892
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
PS3 and

1893
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
the Wii as well as

1894
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
bundles and all those

1895
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
and that

1896
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
would be it

1897
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That's a pretty busy week for games

1898
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
here in America even though there's not a whole lot of

1899
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
AAA titles

1900
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I guess maybe Guitar Hero Aerosmith and Guitar Hero

1901
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
on tour but not a lot of huge stuff

1902
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
but pretty busy

1903
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Alone in the Dark was pretty awesome

1904
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well you know it's not been

1905
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
getting great reviews

1906
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I heard that it got leaked out already

1907
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yeah there was a little bit of controversy

1908
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
over that because Atari is

1909
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
accusing people of

1910
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Well you know, fuck them, seriously

1911
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
They were pissed off that someone was reviewing

1912
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
the game

1913
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
prior to being released because

1914
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
they weren't one of their authorized reviewers

1915
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
or whatever

1916
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
and to their offense

1917
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
they didn't play a pirated version

1918
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
it's just they got one that someone broke

1919
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
street on so it's not

1920
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
necessarily their fault but I

1921
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
still think it's fucked up that Atari's like

1922
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
oh we don't want any independent reviews

1923
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
out there because god forbid it

1924
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I would have told them I was going to give it a good

1925
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
review but fuck you

1926
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I don't know, it's annoying

1927
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and let's not forget

1928
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
though, and we do have another story about

1929
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
this game, but let's not forget that Driver 3

1930
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Atari paid off people

1931
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
to give it good reviews

1932
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Just keep that fresh in your mind

1933
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yikes

1934
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Rapid Slasher in chat

1935
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
says if you buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith

1936
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
you are a tool

1937
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
My husband's buying it, take it back

1938
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I'm thinking of buying it too

1939
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
My husband's buying it, take it back

1940
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
You don't want to face the wrath of Jamie

1941
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Alright, it is a waste of money in my opinion

1942
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
but you know, I don't care for

1943
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
these add-on games that are coming out in the

1944
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
middle there

1945
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, you could put that stuff out as download

1946
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
content I think the song list

1947
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
could have been a little better because I saw

1948
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
the finalized song list today and you know

1949
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I just don't understand why they can't do

1950
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
like say like a $20 download

1951
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
thing or something like that for

1952
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Guitar Hero 3 and just call it

1953
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
because they did that with was it

1954
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Samurai Warriors 2, Empires

1955
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
or something like that, they were going to

1956
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
release its own 360 game for that

1957
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
but they decided, hey, you know what

1958
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
it's not really that much different, I mean

1959
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
it's just kind of an add-on, so we're just going to

1960
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
release this as download content and that's what they did

1961
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I don't understand why they just don't do that with this

1962
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
He took it back

1963
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Probably because of the PS2 owners

1964
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Damn right he took it back

1965
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yeah, but you can release it on those systems

1966
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
but just don't release it

1967
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Just like the rock band Track Packs

1968
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
They can release that stuff

1969
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
standalone or you can do a download

1970
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
for cheaper

1971
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Now Rapid Slasher clarifies the comment and says

1972
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
it's just that the song list is really weak

1973
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
and I kind of agree

1974
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
My husband's favorite band is Aerosmith

1975
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
He probably won't be too interested in

1976
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Guitar Hero Metallica next year

1977
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That's for me

1978
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Guitar Hero Tool isn't a bad idea though

1979
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Yeah, I mean

1980
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I like Aerosmith and all

1981
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
but I'm more of just a fan of Guitar Hero

1982
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and I wouldn't mind having a lot of

1983
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
new songs to play from

1984
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm not buying any of these games

1985
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
until Guitar Hero DVDA comes out

1986
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I kind of

1987
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
want a new guitar too, my other one is starting

1988
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
to break, I've had a guitar hero too

1989
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
but I need a guitar that's going to be compatible

1990
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
with rock band, I'm just not interested

1991
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Well then you probably don't want a Guitar Hero

1992
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
guitar

1993
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
God, so stupid, I hate both of those companies

1994
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I really shouldn't

1995
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
buy any of these games anymore

1996
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
until they find a way to make it work

1997
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Well the 360 though, you do have to remember though

1998
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
that they are at least compatible with each other

1999
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
whereas if you had a PS3 you're fucked

2000
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Alright

2001
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Dark Tetsuya says Guitar Hero Journey

2002
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yes, I would be there first in line, I'd pre-order it

2003
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
the minute it was announced

2004
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Anyhow, getting over to Japanese

2005
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
release dates, my usual source

2006
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
of information of Japanese release dates is not working

2007
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
right now so I have an abbreviated list for you guys

2008
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Over in Japan this week

2009
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
on the Xbox 360, they get Battlefield

2010
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Bad Company comes out

2011
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
on the Playstation 3, The Darkness finally makes its way

2012
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
to Japan as well as Quake Wars

2013
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
or Enemy Territory Quake Wars

2014
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and on the Nintendo Re

2015
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
did I say Nintendo Re?

2016
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The Re

2017
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
The Re, the Wii, Ford Racing

2018
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Ford Racing Offroad

2019
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
was what I was starting to say

2020
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
but somehow combined it all into one word

2021
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Lovely

2022
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Alright, that's going to do it for release dates

2023
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Well, there's other stuff

2024
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
in case anyone is interested

2025
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
and I am particularly interested

2026
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
in this myself

2027
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Okay, you know what one of my favorite games ever is?

2028
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Custer's Revenge

2029
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Hell no, Dragon's Lair

2030
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and the 25th anniversary of Dragon's Lair

2031
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
is coming about and so

2032
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
the

2033
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
artistic, I would say

2034
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
well, the animator

2035
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
that's behind it, Don Bluth

2036
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
is

2037
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
from what I understand

2038
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
is going to be doing

2039
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
an autographed

2040
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
version of the game for

2041
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
a week that will be on

2042
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
DVD, PC, Blu-Ray

2043
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and it's also going to be designed by

2044
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Rick Dyer who was the designer

2045
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and two of the other animators

2046
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy

2047
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Hopefully the Blu-Ray version actually

2048
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
works this time instead of

2049
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
it being broken

2050
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, they said the

2051
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Blu-Ray version is

2052
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
supposed to run at 1080p

2053
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and play just like the

2054
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
original coin-op version

2055
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and there's supposed to be lobby

2056
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
posters that are $80 each

2057
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Geez

2058
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Can we get Space Ace while we're at it?

2059
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I know, right? Well, maybe

2060
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
when the anniversary for Space Ace comes about

2061
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
How about they just animate a new

2062
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Dragon's Lair 3

2063
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I would like to get a

2064
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Commodore 64 signed copy of the game

2065
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'll tell you what, if you've never seen

2066
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Dragon's Lair and the Commodore 64, go check out

2067
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
some old videos of it on YouTube

2068
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Not only was the game insanely hard

2069
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I mean, insanely freaking

2070
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
hard, harder than the actual arcade game

2071
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I will say

2072
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It was kind of creepy

2073
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Like, the music in it was very creepy

2074
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Look it up

2075
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's an animated game that's done

2076
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
just like Dragon's Lair

2077
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Who's driving car? Bear's driving car! Left!

2078
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I don't know

2079
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
There could be a clerk's game

2080
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
somewhere, I'm just not sure that's it

2081
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah, but I don't think the market's real open for

2082
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
in-action games

2083
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Wah wah

2084
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It said it right in front of me

2085
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So

2086
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
if you're looking for something a little bit more

2087
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
action-packed, then perhaps

2088
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
you need a game that comes

2089
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
with a gun

2090
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Yes, actually there is a brand new

2091
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Nerf N-Strike game

2092
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
coming out from EA

2093
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
That will feature a gun peripheral

2094
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
for the Wii that's kind of like, you know

2095
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
something that you strap the remote into

2096
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
But, when you're not playing

2097
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
the Wii, you can actually turn it into a real

2098
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Nerf gun and fire at people's heads

2099
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Like God intended it

2100
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It will be

2101
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
$59.99

2102
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
And we'll include of course

2103
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
the gun shell, it's due out November

2104
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
17th

2105
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
No word on what it is, but hey

2106
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
it comes with a gun, so you know, if the game sucks

2107
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
you can go play outside

2108
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
It's Nerf the game, what else do you need to know?

2109
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Yes, the Nerf game has been

2110
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Nerfed, I heard

2111
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Alright, anyhow

2112
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
We're about

2113
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
done with the first half here of episode

2114
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
number 284, our 6th anniversary

2115
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
show, but we could not say goodbye

2116
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
to part A without taking a moment as we have

2117
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
for quite a while now here on the program

2118
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and paying respect to our elders, and we do that

2119
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
through a little segment we like to call

2120
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
The Classic Video Game of the Week, where Jamie's

2121
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
going to dig through the archives

2122
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
and pick a game in the dusty

2123
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
corner of a closet that she thinks

2124
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
needs a little more respect from you kids

2125
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
that were only 7 years old when the show

2126
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
started, and so on, so

2127
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Dark Soccer, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

2128
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It's a game that I literally tripped on

2129
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
this morning in the vault

2130
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
it had fallen, and I tripped on it

2131
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's SMK Gals Fighter

2132
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
which was on Neo Geo

2133
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Pocket Color in 2000

2134
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Play some of that music

2135
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Dig that 8-bit music

2136
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You know what

2137
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
there's a

2138
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
my friend over at the local

2139
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
plan trade has one of those

2140
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
and he says he'll sell it to me if

2141
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I wanted it

2142
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I don't know what I'd do with that

2143
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It has a really good version of Bubble Bobble on it

2144
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I'm sorry, Puzzle Bobble

2145
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I can only play so many versions

2146
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
of Puzzle Bobble

2147
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We used to keep it in our bathroom

2148
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It has Neo Geo Card Fighters

2149
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
on it

2150
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Card Fighters Clash was actually pretty cool

2151
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
but anyway

2152
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
you've got

2153
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
basically different SMK female

2154
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
characters, hence

2155
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
SMK Gals Fighters

2156
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
that are playable in the game

2157
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
It's a 2D, sorta weird mono color

2158
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Neo Geo Pocket Color

2159
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
did not have that great of a color

2160
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
capability, so

2161
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
the characters are pretty monotone

2162
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
and they're all

2163
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
SD sprites, so it's pretty cute

2164
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
However

2165
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
the characters that are in this game

2166
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
are, you have

2167
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Mai, Shiranui

2168
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Athena, Yuri

2169
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Leona, Shirmi

2170
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
who I named my cat after

2171
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Nakaru, Shiki, Akari

2172
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
from The Last Blade

2173
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Hidden are also Whip from King of Fighters

2174
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and Yuki Kushinata

2175
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
from King of Fighters 97

2176
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and your boss is Miss X

2177
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
which I think is funny

2178
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Rob, do you remember

2179
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
that Margaret Cho sketch

2180
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
she talked about being raised by drag queens

2181
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
and one of them was named Miss X

2182
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and Miss X is Iori Yagami in drag

2183
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Nice

2184
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So I thought I would share that

2185
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And actually

2186
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
one of the characters

2187
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yuki

2188
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
is actually

2189
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
the one I was mentioning before

2190
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
is actually Kyo's girlfriend

2191
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and it's the only game she's ever fought in

2192
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
A bunch of the other guys make

2193
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
cameos, like you have

2194
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Kyo, Ryo, Takuma

2195
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Seikenso

2196
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
and

2197
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Yashiro, a few other people

2198
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
so it's pretty cool

2199
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
and some of the moves were

2200
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
altered to look funny

2201
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
so

2202
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
there you go, Gals Fighter

2203
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Alright, your classic

2204
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
video game of the week, Gals Fighter

2205
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
here on Orange Lounge Radio

2206
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Have I given the Neo Geo Pocket Color

2207
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
any love yet? I think that is the

2208
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
first Neo Geo Pocket Color love we've had here

2209
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
on the program. It was about time

2210
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So there you have it

2211
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio

2212
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000

2216
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Making the definitive list, and this has been a list

2217
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
ten years in the making, we are going

2218

2219
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
