9280	13760	You're probably going hey, wait a minute. I I'm not hearing you guys live. We can always join us
13760	21380	We tape live on all games comm that's all games radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time 9 o'clock Eastern
21800	28720	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show the man in Atlanta, Georgia tapes his show live on Sunday nights as well
28720	31760	And if you haven't heard his show, you really should check that out in iTunes
31760	36520	So we make appearances on the show every week Bobby's kind enough to have us on the show to do a little cross-promotion
37400	41400	Speaking of taping the show live you guys in the podcast didn't get to hear this
41400	46920	But we were actually listening to some of the tracks from the Metal Gear Solid 4 soundtrack during the break there
46920	52240	What did you guys think of it? I thought some of it sounded pretty awesome myself epic soundtrack soundtrack is epic
52240	57640	Yes, epic soundtrack is very epic Loki. I know you were good watching some more scenes from postal there during the break
57640	59640	but yeah, I'm I'm a
60400	63080	Minute or an hour 11 into it and it's an hour
63440	68640	47 minute movie out of curiosity those you guys in chat chat that orange laundry calm. Did you guys enjoy that?
69400	75120	Let us know in chat. All right. Meanwhile, we are gonna get back into some gaming news here on this part B
75120	80400	There's plenty of stuff to talk about. I don't think we mentioned the Wii at all in part a so and I got by the
80400	82760	Way, I got a game this week boom blocks
82760	87680	One of my friends kind of hooked me up with a copy of it looked completely legitimate
87680	90440	He just had some inside connections got me a pretty cheap copy of it
90440	92760	So, uh, I'm looking forward to checking it out cool
92760	97280	So I'll have a review on that next week, but we're not gonna talk about boom blocks right away, right? No
97600	101980	No, we're talking about something that's a little bit more interesting. I guess
102720	109080	Portal everybody loves portal. Well now you can play portal on your DS or a version of it
109080	114800	It's a game called still alive DS. It is a 2d portal home brew game
115480	117400	you remember the
117400	120240	Flash game that they had out there that was kind of similar to the portal
120240	124280	Well, this is kind of similar to that flash game a little bit more cartoony
124280	131600	but if you own a flash card or means of putting a homebrew on your DS, you can download this game for free and
132180	134180	It looks pretty awesome actually
134180	139400	Download it now before lawsuits. I'm actually going to because I have a ninja pass. So
140280	142320	definitely worth checking out it uses the
143180	149040	Touchscreen as well as you know, some of the face buttons on there for launching different portals and stuff. So pretty cool
149040	155040	I will have to play a dark soccer's copy because I don't think I'll be getting to check this out. Otherwise
155640	157640	But it sounds interesting. Yeah
158360	164120	I'm definitely gonna definitely gonna download that cuz you know me and my my minor portal obsession
164120	171000	So I'll have to and folks in chat are playing it right now. Nintendo maniac 64 says ironically. I'm playing still live DS right now
171160	174840	Let's have T says it's rather hard to control. How the hell do I shoot the orange one?
174920	179880	maybe you guys can put your heads together and if you want ones by pushing down on the directional pad or
180520	181800	I
181800	186000	want to say a or see if there's instructions and read them down or a and
186680	190240	The you know, two shoulder buttons are the blue portals. So that's how you do it
190240	194960	Well, thank you very much. You're like a Nintendo game counselor all of a sudden. I love it
194960	202680	Well, they had it they have the screenshots of our I guess artwork shots of the controls. So they're all over the internet
203800	204520	All right
204520	211440	Well the latest issue of Japan's for me to magazine has given us some insight as to what's going on with the Sim City
211640	217760	Series here's the deal Sim City creator is gonna be a new game in the Sim City vein and
217760	221000	It's gonna be coming out for the Wii and the DS
221080	228880	it's gonna be coming out September 22nd of 2008 for North America and September 19th a little bit earlier for Europe and the
229080	232400	Japan and other Asia regions and here's the interesting thing
232400	238400	Is that the Wii game what you can do you can draw your own rivers or tracks using the Wiimote?
238760	241440	You can actually change different styles of your buildings as well
241440	245400	You can do like a Chinese style building an Indian design kind of interesting
245400	247800	You can also make buildings made out of candy
248400	250000	or Chris
250000	252000	Jamie got so excited. She dropped the mic
252880	257840	She was like a candy palace. I was like saying, you know, you can do like a gingerbread house
257840	263640	Well, it makes me think of the opening scene or one of the opening scenes in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the newer one
263720	266080	Did you see the newer one with Johnny Depp? Oh
266800	271540	It's great. That's all I'll say. There's a scene with a chocolate Indian Palace. It's great
271540	276940	Anyhow, also it uses the Wi-Fi connection feature so you can show off the game to friends
277100	281100	So that's kind of cool, especially when you draw those rivers shaped like penises
281780	286660	Which I'm sure a lot of you will be showing each other. There you have some pervy people. There you go
287140	289420	So I'd be called like chocolate check that out
289420	294300	I I loved the first SimCity game that SimCity
294500	297580	2000 and beyond was a little much for me, but I loved the first one
297580	302100	But you know when it gets into too much micromanaging I get like in SimCity 2000
302100	306540	You had to manage the water system with the pipes and everything. It was too much too much
307420	312660	That's why they hire, you know different people to do those jobs blade 3 and check out very excited
312660	314660	He says awesome candy rules
315100	319860	Candy does rule you can have Candyland. It does depend. Yeah, you could actually make Candyland
319860	326060	That'd be great. With peppermint stick. You could actually make Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. That would be so awesome
326060	332020	Yes, I want a river of chocolate. That's right. And I want a wall that tastes like snozzleberry
332780	334780	There's no such thing
336220	338220	Okay, anyway
338820	340820	for people interested in other
341420	344580	Culinary related games that are actually related to food
345740	347740	There's going to be another Cooking Mama
347740	349740	World Kitchen
350500	354460	To be released later this year around October ish
355620	359140	They actually have Majesco has a coming soon
359900	362820	With a release date of October 30th. It's also
363740	368220	That's replacing dinner with friends. As you remember there's Cooking Mama 2 on the DS
368220	371120	This was going to be Cooking Mama 2 on the Wii
371780	374940	But I don't know if they changed the title or actually going to change the game
374940	380780	But it was supposed to be coming out in June now. It's in October. They need to have Redneck Cooking Mama. Look, I'm
381460	386900	They have a game. We make fish sticks. They have a game called Order Up. My roommate just ate that for dinner
386900	390460	Did you smell that inside the house or something? That's hilarious. No, actually
391340	395900	Fish sticks. Funny you should mention that. I walked in the house. I'm like it smells good in here. What did you make for dinner?
396460	401780	Fish sticks. You said fish sticks. No, I said funny that you should mention like a Redneck Cooking game because they're gonna have
401780	407300	Order Up, which is basically like Cooking Mama, but you're working at like a fast food restaurant.
407540	413700	Yeah, they need to have Truck Stop Diner. That would be great. Don't they have Diner Dash? Yeah, same thing. No
414220	415540	All right
415540	421820	Anyhow, sorry. Look, I just hope Cooking Mama Wii kind of blew chunks compared to the DS version
421820	423820	So I really hope they do a better
424540	429780	DS to Wii port this time. The closer you are to the screen the more tight the control would be. That's how I say.
429780	435420	It's... I did not enjoy Cooking Mama on the Wii, although I own it and I'm kind of upset I do
436380	438380	anyways
438460	443380	Now the Wii was... the Virtual Console is supposed to be getting MSX games for quite a while
444180	446180	Finally, Japan has had their first
446420	453540	MSX game release and it's a game called Aleste and what's kind of interesting though is that
453540	460900	is that there's been some additional options to this game that no other Virtual Console game has including the
462540	465980	MSX option menu which allows you to select between
467780	468780	The
468780	472580	MXX hardware-based music and the more advanced FM music that
473060	477980	Back when the MSX was actually a console was in add-on card
478460	482380	So that's pretty cool that you can actually do this in the game by
482380	484780	pressing the minus button
486060	490420	I actually just think that it's cool that that they're getting that game because it's a really freaking good game
490420	496540	And you can also do I guess there's some button change options as well thrown in there. So I
497300	502860	Don't know that's kind of neat that they're adding all these options almost like an actual emulator for this
502860	504860	I don't know why they don't do that with
505660	507660	Any of the other games that come out?
509540	511540	Being a little lazy.
511540	514540	I hope we get Gardic with the deluxe treatment
515260	517260	You knew I had to throw that out there
517980	522340	Some of our longtime listeners was getting really sick of some of our little obsessions
523060	525060	Alright, anyhow, um
525580	530980	Toki Tori is a game that is coming to the North American Virtual Console
531140	534020	WiiWare, I guess it's not really Virtual Console, but you know WiiWare
534700	537540	It's a 2d puzzle game and it's going to cost you
537540	541220	1,000 points or 10 bucks. So there you have it
542020	547940	Apparently this game has been fairly well reviewed. It's a little I didn't like it. You didn't like it you played it
547940	550060	Yeah, can you describe it because I don't know much about this game
550060	554880	It looks like I know I look at screenshots and I go it looks a little load runner ish to me sort of you collect
554880	558460	The eggs basically and then that's pretty much it. I mean you can hop around
559100	564700	Jump different platforms with like motion controls and stuff like that. I don't know. It might be cool later on
564700	569780	I didn't give it that much time, but it wasn't something I was interested in it like time bird. I
570740	574100	don't know about that, but yeah, it's it's very basic but
576060	578580	Act F says the sequel could be called Loki Lori
580180	582940	Get it. Yeah. All right, forget it
585300	591980	Well, how about something different sure different Virtual Console whoo at least in UK
591980	596300	um the games out and this time around are
597780	605100	We have hello Pokemon puzzle league. I'm sorry why to say hello. I'm reading for the thing. It says Pokemon puzzle league
606100	607860	has
607860	609860	Come out
609860	611860	there's also a
611860	620460	A summer showdown which is makes me perfectly happy because it's Nina the actual neogeo versions for their neogeo
621820	625260	Virtual console stuff and actually it's going to be out for 900
626380	633460	We points which is a 630. Oh and before I forget to mention a Pokemon puzzle league is a
634460	636460	thousand points
636460	639540	Burning fight is also the other one that's going to
639540	647300	That's out for 800 points, which is sort of like a Streets of Rage type ball or brawler. So there you go
649420	652820	Cool I would download these games if I had room
653580	660140	Yeah, that that does suck. I don't I don't like having to delete stuff to make room room sucks
661420	665700	There's a game coming out in the u.s. Actually that Japan's had for a while now
665700	670380	It's a game called tornado and a lot of you may not be familiar with this game
670380	673620	it's actually very similar to Katamari Damacy and
674220	681980	The game entails you playing a creature that basically becomes a tornado and you have to much like Katamari
682740	688460	Suck up smaller objects and make your tornado bigger, and then you can suck up larger objects and stuff like that
688900	690180	Tasmanian Devil
690180	691940	something like that and
691940	696260	We'll be coming out on the ds in the fall. I want to say
696980	698420	September I
698420	699540	thought
699540	701980	Thought I saw this in September. I could be wrong
702660	706820	But um yeah, it's kind of neat and kind of a little quirky game
706820	710500	They'll be coming out here a little bit later on so keep an eye out for that
712500	717180	Is this something you've actually played? I haven't played it, but I've just seen screenshots and video of it
717180	721900	Hmm could this be the next big thing. I don't think it's gonna be a big thing, but it's a quirky little game, though
722460	724700	Hmm, it'll be like worth checking out at least
725820	730220	All right, well we have another game coming out on the ds
730220	732620	And I don't know if I would necessarily call this a game
732620	735980	But you know Ubisoft had their big press thing this last week, and they announced some of this stuff
735980	738780	We talked about in part a but here's the other interesting thing
738780	746700	They're going to be making a ds game based on Alan Carr's novel the easy way to stop this game
746700	750940	Is to stop smoking and what the game will do this game is coming out in November
750940	752380	What you do you pick a coach?
752380	758220	I guess in this game, and you create a program based on your smoking habit
758220	764780	And basically what the easy way method does is that you educate smokers about how addiction happens?
765740	770060	Convince them that whatever type of you know great feelings you get from smoking
770780	775260	You get from I guess or you can curb that stuff
775260	780300	And you try to stop the emotional dependency, so it's kind of strange though
780300	787180	This is all coming out as a video game, so this is I don't know interesting not really strange for a movie soft
787180	793340	I I want to know though are the rabbits in this because you know you're funny. No. I need to stop smoking
795340	800380	Like yeah, I think it's interesting that the DS is branching out like this so to speak
800380	804540	I mean brain draining is kind of led to you know a lot of these outside-the-box type games
804540	808380	But I'm gonna tell you what I used to be a smoker, and I quit granted
808380	813340	I was not a very heavy smoker, but enough where I was addicted okay in my mind
813340	815500	I I don't know this might be a personal opinion
815500	822460	I'll probably hate mail over this, but the only way you can quit is to when you say I'm going to quit quit
822460	824460	And then do it cold turkey
825340	828440	But it's one of those things where when you say it mean it well
828440	831180	Here's what this, but I don't I didn't have that huge dependency either
831180	835660	You know so maybe that's how I was able to get away with what this game does though is when you have the urge to buy
835820	839460	Cigarettes it gives you different Ubisoft game options that you could purchase
839780	845220	So it's like instead of buying or instead of buying a pack of cigarettes. How about you buy quick yoga or?
846180	851900	Far cry or yeah far cry or how about purchase the my weight loss coach all comes with a pedometer
852420	858860	You know stuff like that. That's how this game is gonna work frisbee says can't wait till alcoholic hero comes out for the TS
858860	862660	What do you think dark soccer? Do you think this will be an effective game? I?
863660	866780	Think that any tool is effective if someone believes in it
867860	871180	it's a lot of it has to do with with willpower and
872180	874060	whatever
874060	880780	And I hate to use this term, but if the crutch works for you, then use it. I mean I
881940	886660	Don't know. I'm kind of iffy about it. Just anyone who says that
886660	888140	anything
888140	890140	is easy is
890500	893380	Usually trying to I mean they are trying to sell you something
893380	897380	It's they're trying to feed you crap when all you need to do is just
898500	901340	Its willpower, and I know not a lot of people have a lot of willpower
901340	906180	And I know that it is a physical addiction. It is a drug and people are addicted to it
906900	910620	However, it's one that withdrawing from will not kill you
910740	915500	You just have to write it out listen has anyone learned anything from Metal Gear
915500	917780	I mean seriously you can eat tree frogs
918300	923100	No, no look at what smoking a pack of cigarettes gives you more time to figure out boss
923180	927320	He has to fight. You know this crazy war you know fight giant mechs up
927320	930680	Do you really want to fight giant mechs? This is what have smokes in his stomach?
931500	934600	You know this is this is why you know I?
935420	938060	Don't know I have nothing, but really this game is stupid
938060	944140	And if you're suckered in the buying it then I'm sure Nintendo has a few other training programs that they can send your way
944140	950040	Including vision training. I'm sure they're going to have hearing training coming up soon poop training poop training
951760	954160	consumer horror training and how
955360	958420	No, and again. I'm going to stick by this
959140	964000	Any anything is possible if you're willing to work for it the end
964660	967080	Anything worth having is worth putting effort into right?
967920	970760	Yeah, it just depends on how much you want it
970760	976740	I might my whole thing is that if you really really really want to quit smoking if you really want to do it
977000	979360	You don't need a game
980040	986480	You'll just do it a game might help, but you don't need it. It's not like heroin. You know where you could you know I?
987240	994000	Guess have a bunch of complications from withdrawal, but if you need to buy a book to tell you how to quit something
995080	998840	That's retarded. I'm sorry it is retarded
998840	1003240	Seriously, uh how do I quit something stop doing it?
1004280	1006280	Do you really need to buy a book for that?
1007320	1009320	and
1010440	1013440	What I'm gonna say I'm gonna say this because I I will
1013760	1018560	Freely admit that there's lots of things that I have kind of poor willpower about you know
1018880	1026160	But I think that you know if you just sort of say you know nothing changes until you are ready to make it change
1026160	1029960	Until you are ready to make it change, and then do what you need to do to make it change, right?
1030560	1036200	So I think that you just have to want it bad enough to put the effort into it if you want it bad enough
1036200	1038920	You'll do it. That's that's what I think so
1039640	1045720	Alright, well, we'll see how this game does and what type of floodgates it'll open if it does really well in the meantime
1045720	1050760	Let's talk about some I have no pity for people who say I can't stop smoking and hold a cigarette in their hand yeah
1050760	1055760	So you can do it. I wish my mom would quit anyway um
1057040	1063040	Guess what is coming out in Japan a bunch of stuff including the gardening game poop training
1064280	1069020	Poop training coming out in Japan. You know they actually have toilet training cartoons
1069760	1075800	I'm sorry the toilet that sings to you. I'm sorry. I as poop that laughs as it exits the body
1075800	1080600	I'm really sorry. I asked they're funny though anyway um
1081320	1083560	They're getting a fatal frame for
1084160	1091560	If you like your gory ghost games, then that one is definitely going to be the one to go for but it's by Tecmo
1092360	1098040	Grasshopper manufacturer collaboration put putting this out together and fatal frame for it can be also called
1099800	1104080	Poltergeist snap poltergeist snap I like that that's a good name for that
1104080	1107920	I like that, but I'm basically you go around and shoot pictures of dead people the end
1109800	1112960	Did you character at any point go I see dead people I?
1113920	1115920	Develop film of dead people
1116080	1118080	It's only porn if you tape it
1118520	1121760	They should have they should instead of fatal frame. They should have fatal cam
1123040	1130280	Were you um like videotape certain places and then have to run it through like a spectral analysis to have everything show up on film
1130280	1135640	I'm still waiting for what they play calm snap because that uh that that was the picture-taking game
1135640	1137720	I was looking forward to Rob what?
1138640	1142080	Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob whoa whoa whoa what okay? I?
1143200	1145960	Guess it's time for the next story. Yeah, I guess it is
1146600	1153200	Well, we've been talking quite a bit about Ubisoft this show and we're going to continue talking about Ubisoft in fact
1153200	1155720	this was yet another game that was shown off at their
1156520	1158520	Ubi days conference and
1158520	1166000	This game uses the we balance board, but not how you might think the game is raving Rabbids
1166680	1168440	TV party and
1168440	1176440	You sit on the balance board and use your ass to play different minigames nice and Raymond's raving Rabbids
1178400	1183320	You know they're kind of a party game sort of situation there one of the games
1183320	1191520	They show that is actually sliding down a hill on looks like an upside-down moose and you are using your ass to you know
1192040	1194880	Balance yourself as you go down the hill. Oh kind of fun
1195480	1199080	Moose other options are going to have in the game two or other minigames
1199080	1206360	They're going to have a dancing minigame where you have to do different things different poses and stuff which will also use the balance board
1206360	1213240	So it looks kind of neat and of course the raving Rabbids are very funny. This needs to become a sitcom
1214040	1218920	The Rabbids just an ordinary life kind of like a garfield thing that'd be funny
1219480	1225040	Should do like Joe's apartment, but with yeah, yeah, I like we're going there. Yeah, exactly
1226040	1229320	So if it's like garfield will though will will there be a normal ah?
1230080	1233040	I want to know you know I had to go back and read that again Rob
1233040	1236560	What garfield minus garfield minus garfield is excellent?
1236560	1243640	I just and Dan and I had a discussion about this. We've decided that just looking at that either
1244800	1251840	John Arbuckle, you know the main guy right is either really really really sad or
1252480	1255880	Mad like Looney Tunes, maybe a little of both I?
1257160	1258360	Don't know
1258360	1264260	Well, you know what makes me really really sad and then really really mad is the fact that I can't find we fit anywhere
1264260	1269480	because the game sold out as fast as it came out and that is not yet back on shelves and
1269840	1277580	One of those crazy game industry analyst Michael patcher talked to the La times about the we fit supply
1277580	1279440	And how it's so short
1279440	1284400	Apparent but it's very interesting what he says is the reason for this it's because of the value of the dollar
1284400	1288280	Quote the shortage demonstrates one consequence of the weak dollar
1288360	1293640	We're seeing companies ignore their largest market simply because they can make greater profit elsewhere
1294200	1297520	They know that Americans will be just as fat a few months from now
1299760	1305900	Even though there has been about half a million copies of we fit shipped to the us there have already been about 2 million in
1305900	1309860	Europe kind of interesting those things are going on like really
1309860	1317140	Crazy prices on eBay like 180 dollars and stuff like that. That's dumb. It's just like we used when they first came out
1317860	1319140	exactly
1319140	1323800	Alpha canagram and chat says sky should have pre-ordered it. Here's the thing. I didn't know if the game would be any good
1323800	1326300	That's a lot of money to drop my game. You don't know that much about
1327060	1333560	Yeah, I know and then honestly though. I think they're given they kind of blame everything on the weak u.s. Dollar now
1333560	1339460	Oh, there's George must be the weak u.s. Dollar. I don't really think they put that much thought into it to be honest
1339460	1340940	I think it's just
1340940	1342860	They fucked up yet again
1342860	1349440	And so I mean because what would be the point of releasing like for example Mario Kart there was a shortage
1349940	1353660	The week it came out, and then there was a lot more later on next week
1353860	1357500	So you're telling me that the dollar turned around within that week
1357500	1362500	I somehow doubt that much like I doubt that this that once these
1363300	1367960	Stores get replenished with more product that oh, it's because the dollar turned around no
1367960	1371100	I think it's just because they're a retard and poor planning. That's all it is
1373620	1379980	Akuma JP is one of our listeners in Japan and he says there's fit everywhere here now granted the game has been out a lot longer
1379980	1385420	There but what I thought was interesting that he said is a lot of used here, so I think it's not that good
1385580	1389020	So apparently a lot of them are being turned right around in Japan can ship one to me
1389420	1393540	I'll play it can we play it on the American wheeze though their region watch right I?
1393540	1399140	Think you can we can get the art didn't they figure that the it's just the weight limit
1399140	1401420	Let me look at it. Hi. I think they patched the freeloader
1401620	1406700	Yeah, the freeloader should work now actually remember that homebrew channel that we were talking about last week
1406740	1410060	they have the gecko freeloader that you can use on there, which is a
1410980	1412060	basically
1412060	1416980	Region free player for your Wii games nice and it's homebrew and free
1417180	1420940	Ssj100 Matt says I can't get my porn it must be the weak us dollar
1420940	1422860	I
1422860	1424700	Can't get his porn
1424700	1429620	You know they say that were the case then we wouldn't be able to buy any games because everyone would be selling them in different
1429620	1435360	Regions, that's just retarded. You know they say porn is a rescission proof. I don't know we'll see
1435940	1441380	Crunky boy jr. Says I'm sure Nintendo does this on purpose to create a day and do I mean serious?
1441620	1447020	This is retarded now. It's they want this to be the big Christmas item, and that's what they're gonna
1447020	1453340	Do they're gonna make this you know just like the Wii system, and it's gonna be a shortage for like a year and a half
1453740	1455260	You watch
1455260	1456940	All right, we'll see all right
1456940	1462500	Let's see what you the listener have to say you can always email us every week mailbag at orange launch rater calm
1462500	1467380	And every week dark Sakura picks out a few of her favorite emails and reads them to you in a little segment
1467380	1469380	We call the olr mailbag
1469500	1475420	It's a dark Sakura dive in to mailbag orange launch rater calm pull out a few of your favorites and read them
1475420	1477420	uh
1477860	1479940	None of them were my favorite so the end
1481380	1483380	nice try
1483580	1488700	Okay, this one comes from cheeseburger. I'm finally reading one of your emails, so leave me alone
1489980	1495100	Hey guys, I'm going to get an Xbox 360 pro soon, and I want some recommendations
1495620	1501700	Also, I got my first BSOD after playing six hours of Starcraft. I never found out what the problem was dude
1501700	1505380	You're playing six hours of Starcraft. Oh, we need the
1506300	1511300	Starcrafts pretty awesome them or your computer's like stop playing Starcraft play something else
1513740	1518620	It's such a broad question though about the whole like you know Xbox 360 recommendations
1518620	1524460	What do you like you know it really depends tell us some games that you you do like and that'll be good
1524460	1528660	I guess otherwise games that everybody seems to like at least if you're listening to this show
1528660	1534500	I can kind of already tell you probably must like you know the RPG you're not as into like sports games
1534500	1537360	Let's say we don't talk a lot about those unless it's like tech mobile
1538180	1541140	But we talk a lot more about RPGs, so if you like RPGs
1541140	1543920	I think lost odyssey is the best one out there in the u.s.. Right now
1545860	1551020	I'm not sure rez HD says act F. Which is an awesome music game if you like music based games
1551460	1552540	That's definitely a good one
1552540	1554540	I think every extent extra extreme is pretty good
1554540	1561220	Definitely try to mix it up between the arcade titles and the other stuff because there's some great great titles on Xbox live arcade that
1561220	1566340	Are worth your time geometry wars is still some of the best $5.00. You'll ever spend Marvel ultimate alliance
1567620	1573660	But you I still get that on multiple systems, but yeah, yeah, but I still go back and play that all the time
1574300	1578900	What if you're a racing game fan? What's one of the better racing games on Xbox 360 you think I?
1578900	1583620	I I still like the last burnout game project
1584820	1588700	Yeah, it depends. Yeah, I guess a bit. Oh orange box suggests act F
1588700	1592660	Which is you know definitely portal and other great shooter games if you like first-person shooters
1593100	1597660	So there's Tiger Claw Samus is not in Marvel ultimate alliance. It's Iron Man
1598740	1603920	No, it's Samus is in Marvel ultimate or was gonna be a molar ultimate alliance
1603920	1609100	But got cut out wow for the Wii version that the lever and there has been
1609500	1614540	Someone found it in the PlayStation 2 version because you know the code that they just you know edit out or whatever
1616220	1618220	Comment out kind of interesting
1619020	1625580	This then oh my god. There's a video out there. It's on I think Kotaku ran it. I want to say maybe even joystick
1626660	1630300	Alright, so there you go. There's some suggestions if you want more
1630300	1634260	I guess tell us what kind of games you do like and that'll give us some places to start
1635660	1639900	Anyway next email can I read it can uh-huh of course okay?
1640540	1641980	this comes from
1641980	1643380	lichen
1643380	1649060	Hey, olr. Hi. Hey. I just thought that I would say hi and keep up the good work
1649060	1654180	I was just wondering if any of you have seen the video of using the Wii with well
1654180	1656180	And if not I'll send it to you
1656180	1660100	And he did send a link to it, but I'm not gonna watch it
1661020	1663020	It said he thinks it's clean like our comments
1663020	1666180	But why don't we why don't we watch it and comment back on it next week?
1666180	1670500	I guess so because I've heard of it, but I haven't really watched it so Jamie
1670500	1672640	It'll be your responsibility to make sure we watch it for next week
1673940	1676100	Okay, all right. Oh, I have hiccups now
1677220	1680700	Next email yes, ma'am. Hey, olr. Hey
1681220	1684020	I've been listening to your awesome show for some time now
1684020	1687980	And I was just wondering what kinds of places you get your news slash release date really
1688940	1694480	Release dates from if you can't read it on air. Don't feel like revealing them. It's no big deal. I was just curious
1694700	1700440	Thanks PS breadsticks are brought to you by this email home of the never-ending Olive Gardens by amplitude
1702100	1704700	Amplitude we between the three of us
1704700	1709060	We probably look at like a hundred different gaming news sites and blogs out there on the internet
1709060	1712020	And I'll tell you a little bit about how it works behind the scenes behind the scenes
1712020	1716020	We keep a little thread in a private forum that nobody but the hosts and some of the other
1716260	1722980	Olr people who've worked with us for many years can see and basically when stories are interesting we put them in this post and then
1722980	1724980	We you know every Sunday
1725060	1730500	We'll thread them together into what stories are going to cover on the show and usually with few exceptions
1730500	1733300	I usually thread them together into the big big thing
1733300	1738240	But I just try to pick I try to pick a flow like pick the we stories put them together the Xbox stories
1738240	1744220	And you know try to pick big things sometimes I miss things that's why we have last-minute stories and Loki always picks up the crap
1744220	1745740	That I drop under the table
1745740	1750380	I will say though where I get my release dates from since it's come up on the show as a question before is that I?
1750380	1755100	Do actually get my release dates from Eurogamer mm-hmm, which is just great overall
1755100	1760900	And I get my Japanese release dates from import game stores, so there you go although sometimes. I will use
1761420	1768220	Just on my own. I will actually use some of the video game retailers in the UK to verify a few dates
1768220	1772620	But now on the other hand Loki sometimes has insider info on the US release dates
1772620	1775580	Thanks to you know the stuff that he does so yeah, and then other times
1775580	1777300	I'm just lazy and read it off a game stop
1777300	1783360	So there you go nice just depends or Kotaku or now that just wherever has you know whoever has it
1783360	1789060	I've even pulled crap off CNN and and sadly enough because I am in the game selling business a lot of this
1789060	1792420	I have on the top of my head too, so I could you know sometimes
1792420	1798820	I don't even need the release dates gs68 says what is olr a miserable little pile of secrets I?
1800500	1805040	Want to point out there's other people to contribute to the stories you hear on the show dark Tetsuya
1805480	1811180	Also posts in our thread and once in a while Travis Donovan and DMN put their head in there when they see something really interesting
1811180	1818600	So it's not just the three of us that contribute the stories, but just everywhere we have our eyes everywhere like the the
1819140	1820740	but what the
1820740	1826900	Terrorist story from the part a is actually um was a link given to me last night by my friend
1826900	1830040	Who's busy doing a programming test applying for a Namco?
1831140	1834460	And she's like I'm tired of doing this here look at these links are funny
1834460	1838100	You never know so I could I get them from people when I did the other week

1885020	1887220	I'm keep up the good work and join the show
1887220	1890860	I hit the fair by accident and join this show as I'm typing from work ha Kevin

1893420	1896820	Um I have never been to California extreme, but I want to go this year
1897100	1900920	We ran and we actually ran into mela melody there last year
1900920	1905080	They had a hotel then they live and they live there. I think that's funny, but
1906280	1911600	Sometimes you want to get away last year in what where everyone knows your name um anyway um I?
1913000	1918480	Last year was my second California extreme, and it's just a freaking blast um
1919280	1925320	First of all it's air-conditioned which gives it major major points over Pinna Gogo right then and there um
1925320	1932480	um it's like you you go up to the desk you pay your money you walk in pinball oh
1932960	1936720	My God, it's not just pinball too. It's um
1937440	1941480	It's old classic games like they had the journey game there rob
1942320	1946960	That's why I'm fucking sold on this I played a full game of space Harrier
1946960	1952320	I beat space Harrier rob, but it's all in free play right when you get in oh, we're definitely going um
1952320	1956760	Um definitely going they had um. Oh, God. What else was it they had um?
1957280	1962740	That game where you slide a pole back and forth and you're sort of like a tug-of-war game were you?
1962740	1966400	Oh, I thought it was an incredible maze or whatever that no no no no no
1966400	1969900	It's or you you you have to either run them into or push it from the other side
1969900	1975320	It's whoever stronger, but you win matches out of it, and I actually um I'd be who did I be I?
1975840	1981360	Remember who I beat I beat will that was who I beat so look there's your long answer to the short answer yes
1981360	1986180	We're going there's more we asked for opinions of whoever had their first time and they also
1986640	1992400	It is an ultra Kade sort of show-off tech place, so they do have ultra pin there

1999320	2002080	LEDs and everything up in it emulates different tables
2002080	2003960	And they help like and it's just really cool

2135040	2137040	Want the world ends with you
2137040	2140420	And I want the Iron Man game. I'm being denied
2142240	2144240	Guys
2144240	2147640	Game as we want. Yeah, you're looking forward to playing in the summer
2148800	2150800	I
2150800	2152800	Don't know I
2152800	2155520	Have to be honest sir not a lot. I can think of right now
2155520	2158160	We fit whenever I can get my hands on it. I think it'll be fun to play
2159120	2162180	Especially at the little demo. I had the other week, but as far as like games
2162180	2165280	I'm really looking forward to I can't think we're gonna live in your underwear, huh?
2165280	2168160	Can hula hoop in your underwear? I just might we should get you some underoos
2168720	2172240	No, thank you to contain that you looking for anything
2173160	2174400	I
2174400	2176400	was looking forward to Saints Row 2
2177360	2180100	but I can't now because
2180100	2186660	Later news Final Fantasy for DS if that ever comes out. I don't think that's coming out. It is summer. Is it a summer?
2186660	2192540	Yeah, it's July and the civilization game. So there you go. Okay, I'm looking forward to I
2193060	2198300	Thought I might be looking for grid. I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick that up. I think the next game I have an order is
2200020	2204900	Shit it was good to her here on DS, but I don't think I want that anymore. I
2204900	2209620	I don't know. I may just get like one of those DS
2210380	2216700	R4s or r6 is or wherever they are now and just homebrew. I might buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith for laughs
2217820	2222040	Well, I'm going to continue because I don't know please do
2222620	2227540	What I'm still waiting on. Oh, no, what I'm still waiting for is my Okami covers. Me too. Hi
2227540	2232820	I ordered one the week of when you said how to get one and I'm still waiting for it a month after
2232820	2236260	Have you gotten your cover yet? No does and does it look cool probably
2238180	2244980	I'll find out it looks cool on the website and well after reading some rave reviews and some really odd statistics
2244980	2248060	I picked up a copy of Grand Theft childhood from my local library
2248540	2252120	Well, I haven't read a whole lot of it finals week soon have to cram
2252120	2254120	I have to say I'm quite impressed
2254180	2260040	They somehow debunk all of the gaming myths such as violence and sex and shed some light on the hot topics
2260040	2263660	Like what girls actually play and how violent video games reduce stress?
2263660	2269080	I can't wait to finish it as well as my newly acquired copy of Katamari Damacy. I
2270740	2272740	have to say I was I
2273460	2279480	Was a little five-year-old boy again after hearing the news about DDRX and DDR hottest party to last week
2279620	2283500	Well, I know most of the world has moved on with other lavish music games
2283500	2288220	I'm still anticipating the release of one of the best franchises Japan has ever given birth to I
2288220	2295560	Must be the only one in Michigan who cares about this now and speaking of Konami. Are they what Rob you're grabbing the mic?
2296100	2300220	No, no, is it for support? Yeah, just getting ready in case I think of a witty comment
2300220	2305740	Okay, speaking of Konami. Are they really serious in releasing rock revolution in its current form?
2305740	2310420	I mean they should just change the engine to unreal 3-1 and put arrows instead of colored cues
2310700	2314780	But really Konami and Konami and Bemani should just release a guitar
2314780	2322420	Slash drum freakish type game and ditch the rock and roll is in vibe that just makes them sing like copycats of their own concept
2323700	2328840	hopefully the DLC and hottest party 2 will be one unlockable key that unlocks everything and
2329220	2335320	More for just 200 points or less we could hope but will they probably not three more things?
2335940	2341740	Thank you for giving us a countdown. How's dr. Mario online? Can you really send we friends a demo?
2341740	2346660	From what I understand. Yes, and somebody has sent me a demo, but I haven't bought the game myself yet
2346660	2351020	And we don't get copies because we're not special. So we have to buy them just like you
2351700	2353860	Rob are you going to penny arcade Expo?
2355100	2361220	That's the plan. I will know for sure in a couple weeks, but I am planning on going and ferret
2361220	2364420	Are you really going to be in a horror movie as the slasher that kills everyone?
2364420	2366620	I think we should let the ferret answer that don't you think I?
2366620	2374580	I don't think you should give them. Oh you shouldn't give so much plot details away ferrets. You know what ferret?
2376300	2382060	Okay, that's good enough, baby. I like the other one that made the different noises. I know the wolfie looking one. Yeah
2382820	2384420	Okay, I
2384420	2386540	Regret that this letter is very super long
2386540	2389420	I it's just that I had to say was on my mind
2389420	2395180	And I really didn't have the time until now until then your favorite email or freeway shuffle into the next DVR iteration
2395180	2397180	Cottamari is forever PS
2397180	2403340	This message should be brought to you by the Olive Garden, but instead it's currently asking permission to be endorsed by Bobby black wolf
2404380	2405580	although as
2405580	2407580	Cottamari's forever wrote booby
2409100	2416980	That's time. Maybe that's his cousin. It's a typo all right two more emails. They're little all right. Are they short. Yes, haven't j-rod
2418460	2420460	Hi guys
2420460	2426620	Just a quick hi j-rod just a quick comment. I was just listening to episode 279 at work the other day
2426620	2432820	When Loki started his rant about we fit and how Nintendo is just trying to find any market of soccer moms and people who watch
2432820	2437340	Oprah by the end of his rant I found myself almost clapping with my headphones on again
2437340	2442860	Loki echoes my thoughts around the world this email sponsored by the Olive Garden home of never-ending salads and breadsticks
2443380	2445380	Don't encourage him
2445380	2448420	I didn't say anything about it. Mommy heart
2451260	2453260	You know he likes it anyway
2453900	2457220	I was just wondering if you were going to do a show on a
2457700	2460740	Saturday on a long weekend like you talked about a while back
2460740	2464060	Oh, well our goes past midnight where I live and I have to get up at 5 in the morning
2464340	2468460	The show is comedy gold and I will listen until it is long dead like DTR
2468980	2473040	Thanks for putting on such a good show week after week, and that's BHK 667
2473040	2476660	I don't know so much about Saturday, but we did talk about doing a show like around noontime
2476740	2478940	So we should still make sure that happens at some point
2480020	2485740	Sometime over the summer you know what we should do although. It would probably kill us what do an all-night marathon
2485740	2487740	No way my die
2488940	2494580	I remember what happened when I did a marathon show at you know the tournament we had at scandia
2494580	2495420	That wasn't fun
2495420	2500540	Do you run out of things to talk about and it's just now if we if we found something though to keep things interesting like maybe
2500540	2506300	Rotating out old video classic video games for a night or something there there, or we did it for charity or something
2506300	2511300	There might be a reason to do it. I don't know maybe Labor Day weekend, but don't hold your breath
2513020	2515020	Alright, so that's it for emails
2515020	2520360	Yeah, if you would like to contribute mailbag at orange launch rated comm is the place to go for now more gaming news
2523700	2527340	So as I kind of hinted what we were talking about games for the summer
2527340	2531860	Sorry hold on black wolf reminded me Labor Day weekend is the same as packs for some reason
2531860	2536700	I thought it was a weekend before so what's the next three-day weekend after Labor Day weekend? Maybe Thanksgiving?
2537300	2543440	That's not a three-day weekend rob four-day weekend. No, it's not support a pre weekend. No, it's not whatever I
2544660	2547940	Probably won't be here. How about I?
2548860	2550860	Don't know let's make up our holiday
2550860	2556660	Seriously, we'll figure something out. We'll make up a holiday olr day. That's it
2556660	2560440	We have olr day, and we can all take off from work. We'll see we'll see
2562260	2565820	Anyways say zero two has been delayed to October 14th and
2568020	2571880	You know because I would imagine that grand theft auto 4 is so awesome
2571880	2577020	so you know they have to spend the extra time making sure that say zero two doesn't suck and
2577020	2584780	Apparently they're saying you know of course marketing issues and product quality is the reasons for the oh?
2586500	2593060	Product quality well, it's just making sure that the game's not so glitchy. You know after all we don't want another musical
2593980	2598220	Detailing the glitches in the game. Well. I do, but you know no one else does
2598900	2600380	I don't know
2600380	2604380	I think it's kind of cool though that they're putting it out so late because I guess me enough time to be done with
2604380	2607820	Grand theft auto 4 not that I'll ever be done with grand theft auto 4
2607820	2610520	But you know to the point where I can play another game
2611660	2614700	All right, in fact. That's what I'm going to do this summer's play games
2614700	2619460	I already have well while you're waiting for a new game such as Saints Row 2 to come out
2619460	2624140	There's always Xbox live arcades weekly releases to keep you company and this week
2624140	2629100	There are two releases and none of them is a rehashed arcade title. That's pretty exciting
2629100	2634740	Roo goo is one of the titles coming out. It sounds like ragu the pasta sauce
2634740	2641980	This is just me, but Roo goo is coming out from South Peak, and it's a puzzle game coming out for 800 Microsoft points
2641980	2645180	That's $10 and apparently it's a four-player game
2645180	2652340	It doesn't have to be what you do you slide pegs of different shapes into appropriate holes while you're trying to save an alien race
2652620	2654780	So it sounds like the game perfection
2654780	2660660	Put a little different that sounds bizarro could be interesting the screenshots definitely look bizarro
2660660	2666100	They have a very katamari ish vibe to them, but thankfully all Xbox live arcade games come with a demo
2666100	2668460	So we'll be able to find out and if that's not your cup of tea
2668460	2673260	Maybe aces of the galaxy will be that is the other game that's going to be coming out unfortunately
2673260	2677340	We don't know a lot about it. We know it has co-op play and
2678140	2683900	It's also an 800 point price tag, and it's coming out from our tech and we have a screenshot
2683900	2687540	So it looks like a space game hence Galaxy, but that's about it
2688980	2691340	So you'll have to check that out when the demo comes out
2691340	2698380	But if you've been for whatever reason secretly following aces the galaxy no more information. We do well, then the payoff is this week
2699140	2701060	There you have it
2701060	2703060	Hey, y'all hey
2703820	2706820	Hmm hey hey listen what?
2709180	2711180	Galaga yes
2711180	2715660	um there is a listing up for a
2716500	2719860	Galaga legions for Xbox 360
2720380	2725580	It's actually put up by the usk which is the German version of the ESRB
2725580	2732260	And I would so try to pronounce it if I didn't suck completely a German so whatever although actually that did remind me something funny
2732260	2734260	I found in GTA 4 by the way
2734740	2736460	But I'll talk about that later
2736460	2738340	All righty
2738340	2742260	Okay, they have they have a billboard for something called pass what?
2743060	2746260	pass was sir piss water, so anyway
2746780	2748780	That's funny, okay
2748980	2752900	So um so basically it's it's a shooter. That's about
2753620	2760980	All we know so but it's Galaga and they're not sprightly. You know in pixely so
2760980	2769540	Okay, you know what though the weird thing about this is that it makes me think maybe it's an upgrade thing like pac-man vs.
2769540	2771340	Was or not?
2771340	2776220	Versus pac-man of wealth I mean that was an upgrade, but you know I'm thinking a pac-man championship edition
2777020	2779740	Kind of like that although pac-man championship edition is pretty awesome
2779740	2784340	So they are making a game like that, but out of Galaga that could be kind of cool because I actually like Galaga
2785780	2788980	So I don't know I like Galaga a whole lot
2788980	2795140	I actually have a little um charm thing. That's the the ship somewhere
2796740	2800140	Hmm, I don't know if I care for Galaga that much but
2801460	2806540	but one game that people seem to care about quite a bit was penny arcade and
2807660	2815020	The penny arcade game actually penny arcade adventures was the highest grossing Xbox Live arcade debut ever
2815580	2817580	earning
2817580	2825660	$20,000 in its first three days, and that's according to of course VG charts the prior record holder was worms HD and
2826580	2834780	I guess in term of units sold on the rain slick precipice of darkness was the third highest performer of 2008
2836380	2838380	So that's pretty cool, huh?
2838660	2839860	Well that good for them
2839860	2843420	I still have not bought the game, but I think I'm going to because I had a lot of fun with the demo
2843420	2847620	So we'll see but the penny arcade game good for them
2847860	2849860	It's a funny game. I know that
2850220	2854540	Well, I know Loki's going to be very excited about this and this could break records of a different kind
2854540	2857020	It's not an Xbox live, but virtual console
2857500	2863540	There's a game. I know that Loki has been begging and pleading for on virtual console for the longest time
2864180	2870800	Guess what Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars is apparently making its way to
2871740	2872780	Japan
2872780	2877140	It's going to be in June. It's made its way to the June release calendar and
2877700	2883840	You know the games that tend to show up in the Japanese calendar usually end up over here eventually
2884620	2887100	So there you go one thing though
2887900	2893620	Nintendo has made the game cost an extra 100 we points just because they know this game will be better so
2893780	2900240	900 we points for this game there you have it by the way some other games that show up on the Japan's June release list
2900240	2904480	For the NES Yoshi's cookie, which we already have here
2905120	2907120	Nekketsu Coco dodgeball boo
2907400	2914320	For the Sega Master System Rambo for the Genesis Phantasy Star 4 for PC engine which over here was
2914640	2920920	TurboGrafx-16 power tennis days of Thunder paranoia and blazing lasers and for the neo-geo
2921160	2925760	Lasers for the neo-geo king of monsters ninja commando and art of fighting too
2926360	2928360	So do you know the art of fighting?
2928360	2929440	I
2929440	2931560	Know there's a character named after me in art of fighting
2931560	2938000	No, I am I spent like about 30 minutes today reading the Wikipedia article about Dan and in
2939640	2944640	From the Street Fighter alpha series and how he was a big parody of Rio and
2947280	2949280	Robert Garcia
2949680	2951680	Hmm with Yuri's taunts
2951760	2958080	So interesting, but I know I don't know are you excited about Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console?
2958080	2960080	Loki or I am pretty excited about it
2961720	2966200	Just have to wait for it to come out over here. Yeah, we'll be waiting Nintendo. We're sitting here waiting
2967040	2968640	I'm not
2968640	2975960	Fine, then why don't you read a story or something? I think I will then guess what else is going to be on the Wii
2977080	2982720	Beer pong game no you have to guess though cuz I'm not gonna read the story well. I know the answer tech mobile
2982720	2987720	Oh done the done um not the Virtual Console releases
2987720	2990560	We've already got but we'll have tech mobile kick off
2990880	2996320	Which is a new football game that is going to be on the Wii, so it's um
2997240	3000280	going to be on the Wii and we'll probably use a wiimote and
3000920	3008840	It's football that's about all that we've got details on but I'm I'm sort of agreeing with this article that it's it's
3009040	3011040	Has the stench of we wear about it
3011040	3016200	Will it have the awesome halftime cutscenes that the NES version had?
3016720	3023200	That's what I'm hoping for I believe in the it's going to be on Wii and be about football should cover about everything
3023200	3025200	I know about that game
3025200	3027040	fine
3027040	3031640	Be that way see if I care. I will hey our skype line is going to be open very soon
3031640	3034860	1 8 7 7 game Olr if you want to get in on the fun
3034860	3040540	We have a couple more stories to read for you first loki. I was going to say also one thing to
3042180	3045220	Going back to the tech mobile that is interesting this here
3045220	3051820	You can customize your team's everything down to the logos to the player stats names, Etc
3052380	3055220	That's how they're getting around not having license
3055940	3060140	Because you can make your own team, ha ha nice smart
3061140	3062860	anyways
3062860	3064860	something else that's coming to
3064980	3068760	Consoles well not anytime soon, but eventually
3069500	3075340	Street fighter 4 and one of the cool things about Street fighter 4 is other than online play
3075340	3078300	You'll be getting some new characters from the arcade
3078980	3082460	And two of the characters that they showed concept art for
3082980	3084980	Faye long and Dan
3086700	3088700	so that's pretty cool and
3088700	3094100	uh there's also supposedly more characters Beyond just those two, but
3095380	3097180	to the start
3097180	3102860	It's kind of interesting to see that they're adding characters from you know Street fighter turbo and stuff like that plus
3102860	3105540	It's Dan, and I'm sure that makes Jamie kind of happy
3105540	3106020	Yeah
3106020	3111860	this is he cracks me up because I love that his one of his attacks is it translates to
3112420	3114420	taunting legend and
3114420	3119420	Shiny fist I love all of his attacks. They're just hilarious
3119420	3123380	I actually kind of like playing as Faye long and the street fighter super game, so
3124060	3126580	I'm excited to hear he's in the street fighter for
3128260	3130260	Sound he always made that's pretty cool
3132260	3133620	There you go
3133620	3137740	All right, we'll be checking that out when the street fighter 4 comes out here in America
3138460	3141600	Hopefully sooner rather than later. We'll see anyhow
3141600	3147760	Steam I talked about steam earlier when I was talking about audio surf which I was reviewing earlier in the show
3148160	3152880	Valve has announced that there will be a new edition coming to steam. It's steam cloud
3153240	3156040	It's the services announced this past week what it's going to do
3156040	3162280	It's going to store your steam player data online and the cool thing about that is that you can access your save games
3162800	3168080	Keyboard configurations all the games that you purchase through steam from any computer anywhere
3168080	3171840	So that was something that was announced for earlier this week
3172560	3177140	Valve is very committed to PC gaming and saying the PC retail is not doomed
3177880	3184560	Even though they sometimes have these free weekend games on steam it just in turn supports stronger sales at retail
3184560	3186560	You know some people just don't want to buy their games online
3187320	3193520	So we'll have to see how this turns out. It sounds pretty cool in theory doesn't it yeah, so we'll see how that works
3193520	3198520	Yeah, in theory you never know how that's going to work all right the skype line is now open
3199040	3202760	1877 game, Olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio
3202760	3207040	And we're going to go to the skype line right now and take a call hi you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

3222600	3226760	I don't know if it's last minute or what but we'll do an Olr lunch or something if nothing else
3226760	3228360	So if I decide to go that
3228360	3232920	That might throw me what little chance I have to go to comic-con this year. Oh
3233880	3240920	Decisions decisions comic-con I hear is pretty awesome. I've never been myself, but I mainly go to comic-con mainly because my

3253560	3257880	I don't know about jamie, but I see it as more of a day trip than a weekend trip personally
3258040	3261240	I don't think it's something I want to stay the night for i'm actually gonna go for both days. Wow
3261960	3263320	She's dedicated

3284280	3289960	I'm thinking of taking the day off work to go with uh, my uh boyfriend so we can go ride some rides. So it'd be fun
3293800	3295080	I've been there
3295080	3300120	Once this year and I didn't pick up a season pass. Unfortunately, didn't they have a new ride there this year?

3348840	3352840	one thing I missed about going to fonome this year was uh getting to go to the dealer's room and the

3391080	3393480	All right. Well gs60. We gotta let you go take some more calls

3404920	3406920	Hi, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?
3406920	3411960	Hey, what's up, guys? It's toshin. Hello toshin. What's on your mind my friend. Uh, not much
3412360	3416920	Uh, I wanted to know rob if you've got picked up super budge dodgeball for the ds this week
3417480	3419480	No, I forgot it came out. Did you get it?
3420040	3424520	Yeah, I actually uh, I played my friend's copy loaned it to me. It's pretty fun. Oh my god
3424680	3427480	Tell us about this game. Is it is it faithful to the original or what?
3428040	3433640	I would say it's pretty faithful. Um, I only got to play like a multiplayer brawl, but I mean you can
3433640	3439800	Apparently level up like your players and there's like 14 or 15 different like teams you can pick
3440520	3446360	And like your super shots are apparently picked on your birth date that you enter in the q the whenever they ask you for it
3446600	3448600	Huh? That's kind of interesting
3448920	3452200	yeah, so I don't know all the combinations of like the super shots, but
3453000	3453880	Oh
3453880	3456280	My friends is pretty cool. It's kind of like the one where
3457080	3461880	You know when you run and it was like one of the slider ones like it was back and forth like a vertical ball, right?
3461880	3465080	He he had that one set up which was kind of cool. Huh? I didn't
3466280	3471320	But eight man brawl. Oh, that's really fun. Oh my gosh, this game sounds pretty awesome already
3471320	3475320	Can you play it over wife? Uh, can you play over internet wi-fi or is it just local wi-fi?
3475480	3482120	It's it's it's just a single card multiplayer on full trip. Fortunately, it's that's the only downfall I was like this has to have wi-fi
3482680	3487400	No, at least it's got the single or you only have to have one card to play multiplayer. That's kind of nice, I guess
3487400	3494200	Yeah, it's awesome. So cool. Well, I think for the reminder they came out. I gotta go get it. Oh, you have to get it. Hmm
3495000	3496360	All right
3496360	3500040	Very cool. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight? Any other games you've been playing or what have you?
3500600	3504920	Uh, I haven't been playing a lot because i've been working a lot, but you know
3505560	3509880	I I probably won't make use of the six or eight hundred microsoft points. You're going to give me this
3510840	3513880	Yeah, finally I finally got that over to you. So uh, definitely check that out
3513880	3518920	Well, you're supposed to be getting rez hd with it. That was the deal. So, uh, that's the
3521400	3524920	So, oh no i'll make use of the points I will definitely make up use of the points and
3525240	3528120	You know, we have to play like rock paint or something soon or something. All right
3528120	3533400	Well, I want full reviews on whatever you get later on. Okay, you got it. All right, take care tosha and have a good one

3538440	3541720	Super dodgeball ds. I had no idea what's coming out. Hey, the phone's ringing off the hook tonight
3541720	3544280	We're already into another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
3545400	3550680	Yo, this jammer jay. Hello jammer jay. What's on your mind? I don't believe i've heard you call before have you called before?
3551320	3555160	Um, I haven't called before. Oh, well then hello first time caller. What's on your mind?
3556040	3559800	Nothing. That was one. Um, hold on a second. I'm getting a little lag. That's all right. It happens
3560120	3563800	You got to shut down the porn torrents when you're listening. No, i'm just kidding. Yeah, okay
3564360	3569560	I was curious on um, oh, I don't usually have those running about now. I was curious. What uh, um,
3569560	3572120	What is the farthest you guys have ever traveled just to play?
3572840	3576760	Ddr like a road trip just to solely played an arcade version of ddr
3577080	3582520	Oh good question farthest we've ever traveled to solely play an arcade version of ddr
3582680	3585960	Loki do you have any uh answer for this? Well, it's pretty much just like three hours
3585960	3592200	I think we've been driving drove from here to like san jose or milpitas to play like some japanese
3592840	3596040	stuff there. I remember also we drove to stockton golf land to play, uh
3596040	3601160	Extreme I was max 2 when it first came out. Yeah max 2 when it first came out. They only had a stockton golf land
3601720	3606920	Uh, well, here's the thing do like tournaments count because we drove all the way to san diego once to go to a tournament
3606920	3609240	At rays and san diego is like a 10-hour drive from here
3610120	3615640	So that was pretty that's like one of the farthest I can think of or if you guys drove to like, uh, was it um,
3615800	3621000	The japanese arcades arcade infinity. I was thinking I don't I didn't drive all this way to play ddr
3621000	3624120	But I have driven that whole way to play beatmania 2dx would be
3624120	3628600	Arcade infinity, which is in la which is about uh, six and a half hour drive from here
3629240	3634600	So, how about you? How much the furthest you've ever driven think about six hours, but sometimes when I um
3635160	3639080	Go on trips. I make it a highlight to hit up any ddr in the area. So I think
3639720	3641720	Maybe like 10 hours
3641720	3646520	See that would that's kind of similar to something that's being mentioned in chat right now is this is j100
3646520	3650360	Matt is saying rob did go to new jersey to go to a ddr tournament and that's true
3650360	3657560	I happened to be in um allentown pennsylvania the exact same weekend that a ddr tournament was going on at eight in the break
3657560	3659160	Or was it in the groove? I think it was both
3659160	3663240	Um, and so I actually drove over to eight on the break in new jersey
3663240	3667480	Which is about a 90-minute drive just check out this tournament and see what the east coast scene was like because you know
3667480	3669000	There's a whole that east coast versus west coast
3669000	3674920	Although I didn't know anybody I really felt kind of like a fish out of water just because I was like a stranger and I
3674920	3679000	Wasn't really participating or anything and nobody really knew me over there. So I was like, oh my god
3679000	3684680	He really knew me over there. So it was um, you know, but I had a good time. It doesn't mean I didn't have a good time
3687720	3691080	What's that i've been to a ddr tournament in beluxy when I went back to visit
3691240	3694840	I know I know you were out for a moment when the caller first called in but he was wondering what's the furthest you've ever
3694920	3697960	Gone just to play ddr just to play ddr. Yeah
3698760	3704520	And I was I was saying okay beatmania 2dx at least there's been arcade infinity, but that's close actually
3705080	3707080	I went to san diego
3707160	3708360	to um
3708360	3714600	Well, I was going to san diego anyway, but one of the things I intended on doing was playing. Um
3715400	3717640	The uh, ddr max when it was new
3717800	3722280	That's right because rays was like the first place anywhere that had that huh and I went and played it
3723080	3727480	And that's when I realized that doing um that the hold arrows hurt really bad
3728280	3730760	Because i've got a little bit of a weakness in my ankles. So
3731720	3736200	But um other than that though the farthest distance i've traveled and then played ddr
3736200	3738520	Was um going back to alabama
3739480	3743000	From here. Okay, that's that's cool. Was that um, beluxy tournament at boomtown?
3743720	3748120	I do believe it was it was a few years ago. It was, you know, definitely before katrina
3748440	3751720	Um, and it was when we had a max they were just getting a fifth mix
3754440	3758200	Okay, yeah, I think I remember that because my buddy was working at that arcade there in boomtown
3758440	3763560	Wow, it wasn't boomtown now that I think about it because it was that the arcade was sort of off to the side
3763560	3770120	If I remember correctly and and it was a shiny brand new machine and I got up there and I think I played um
3770120	3772120	Why didn't I play superstar?
3772760	3777160	Because that was no it wasn't that it was when I was I had this thing about doing um
3777560	3779880	What was it that I used to always play? Um in hidden?
3781560	3787480	I don't remember I used to play I would only play the song hidden. Anyway, I don't remember but that's how how long ago that was
3788040	3792440	But yeah, it's a small world me and dark sakura are from the same part of the u.s
3792440	3797000	Oh, yeah, there you go. Next next time I next time I go hit up the home front, you know
3798120	3802200	Ddr. Well, not i'm not down there though. I'm in idaho. Oh, i'm sorry
3803800	3809000	Hey, but there's a um within two hours is supernova 2 arcade. So that's not too bad. That's sweet. That's cool
3809080	3813640	Yeah, apparently there's a supernova 2 in roseville, but i've yet to play it. You know, i'm just I I
3814600	3817000	I love being from the south, but I don't miss living there
3817000	3823480	It's a place you want to visit once in a while I don't ever go visit in the summer ever I made that
3823560	3825900	Yeah, I like it in the summer down there humidity
3826840	3829320	Really quick question for you jammer jay, and then we're gonna let you go
3829400	3837400	But um, do you think that the ddr home versions have kind of killed that whole desire to drive out and uh, go play other types
3837400	3838760	of ddr
3838760	3842200	I don't know the um reason i'll play the home versions that much as I don't up here
3842280	3845720	I don't have a good since I live in an apartment complex. I can't use my cobalt flux
3845720	3849480	It depends on what you play at at home on the actual platforms
3849720	3853720	I had that problem when I lived with extra furs that we lived upstairs and when I played ddr
3853880	3856440	It wasn't fun for the downstairs people so I couldn't do that
3857560	3858840	so
3858840	3862680	Yeah, but other than that like some people in the home version they have just as much fun on it
3862680	3866280	But I would need to really play in the arcade because I hit pretty hard on the pads, huh?
3867400	3870040	All right. All right. Well jammer jay, we gotta let you go to get some more calls
3870040	3873800	So thanks for the call and uh, I hope you call in again sometime. We like cool. Thanks
3873800	3875800	Peace out and triple a peace out
3876520	3878520	Peace out. All right
3878760	3884360	What was the other thing you said in triple a oh like car insurance? Yeah, I guess so or maybe you know high score
3884760	3886760	ddr triple a
3887800	3889800	Where you make the machine go oh
3890280	3893080	One more call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
3893880	3898360	Hey, hey, hey, it's ronma. God. You always get through you got the miracle dialing finger. That's all right
3898360	3900360	We like you at least what's on your mind?
3900360	3908200	Not too much. I'm recovering from wizard world philly which was this weekend from what wizard world wizard. Oh, really? How is that?
3909960	3915400	Want me to be honest, yes, of course it sucked why did suck
3916920	3921000	As much as they really said this would be a big comic book convention
3921400	3926600	I could tell you look like no more than ten thousand people showed up at least it was just quiet
3926600	3930680	You know, it was just like bleh, you know, I don't know ten thousand sounds like a lot to me
3930680	3932680	I mean, it's no comic-con but still
3934200	3938600	Plus, um, the tournaments were kind of crappy too. That's too bad
3940360	3947320	So what is it really pissed me up is the fact that somebody was there selling roms and emulate emulators and roms for
3947800	3949800	Between 30 and 50 bucks. Oh
3950200	3955160	That's that you can get really busted for that. I mean, it's kind of illegal to begin with but when you're selling it for profit
3955160	3958840	That's when they really go all out of the way to get you. You gotta be careful
3959480	3962120	Turn them in the funny thing is with hmm. I said turn them in
3963480	3967560	Well, there's already someone going around doing that but at the comic conventions
3967560	3973480	They really bust you more for selling bootleg tv shows and movies and stuff like that. It's really sad when you see
3974120	3976120	like your favorite tv show
3976440	3982280	At the con for sale the entire first season for like 40 bucks where you can go to best buy and get it with a better
3982280	3984600	Quality, um cover for like 20
3985720	3987720	hmm
3990120	3993720	All right, well interesting, um, would you tell me a little more about this con
3993720	3997640	It was comics and games and like anime and like all that all rolled into one
3998440	4004440	Something like there's more comic books than they add in a touch of science fiction and anime. Um, kind of like
4005640	4008680	Because that's what comic-con does. I mean comic-con is supposed to be about comic books
4008680	4014280	But hello, like, you know, the battle star galactica people show up every year and so, you know turn into this big big thing. So
4015240	4020760	Well, even with starbuck being there still wasn't all that big big big thing. Ah, too bad starbuck was there
4021480	4024680	Yeah, my roommate was online for two hours to get her autograph. Nice
4026280	4031400	Good times. I've actually I finally been catching up on battle star galactica. I'm in the third season right now. So good times
4032120	4037160	I'm yeah overall. I don't think we're going back next year. Oh, that's too bad. Well, there you go
4037160	4038280	Oh

4233080	4235080	um nintendo actually had
4235560	4240520	released some dates for japanese game releases and there's some new games on there that
4241000	4246440	A lot of people might not know about including well this one they showed off before mario's super sluggers for the wii
4246440	4252600	Which is coming out june 19th there then they've got band brothers dx, which is coming out on the ds
4253240	4257480	That's june 26. Then july 10th is resident evil zero
4258120	4262920	From capcom july 24th is wario land shake on the wii
4263560	4265560	which is going to be kind of like a
4265880	4270280	Super paper mario type game all sides scrolling but um using we
4271560	4274520	Motion controls and stuff like that. All right about that sounds kind of interesting
4274520	4278200	july 31st fatal frame 4 the mask of the lunar eclipse
4278840	4282600	And also on the 31st rhythm tengoku gold
4283400	4288520	Another rhythm music game and fire emblem ds in on august
4289480	4295000	Seventh and uh, they had a little they have a screenshot or not really well a scan I guess
4295560	4300680	Of some of the stuff for wario land shake. It looks pretty cool. That's just like a platforming game and stuff
4300680	4306840	That's just like a platforming game and stuff. Um, let's see here also, um
4308200	4313480	There's um a new tournament going on for mario kart wii this one's a little different
4313560	4320040	It's not just like a race and times and stuff like that. You're actually doing a boss battle and you're battling. Um,
4320680	4324680	The uh spiky top man from um, super mario galaxy
4324680	4330600	so that's kind of neat that they actually have almost kind of like download content for this game that you're um,
4331000	4332200	Fighting a new boss or something
4332200	4336120	I don't know why they include something like this in the game like maybe a story mode or something like that
4336360	4340040	But at the very least though, um, you can check it out for free
4340680	4342280	and um
4342280	4343320	the
4343320	4348440	Exclusive tournament and content ends june 9th. So if you want to check that out
4349160	4350520	Do it now
4350520	4351880	um
4351880	4353320	Let's see here
4353320	4357320	Apparently there's a that game next week grid that's coming out
4357400	4362040	Um, it's the xbox 360 version is apparently freezing up on people
4362680	4364680	uh-oh, so, um
4365320	4371400	Oh code masters is rushing to fix the game already, which I believe has been released in the uk already
4371880	4376920	But uh, you know, we'll be coming out soon maybe a day one patch or something like that. Um
4376920	4383720	Um, they say no, we're getting close through the problem and we're fixing or we will be including a fix and a backup work around option
4383960	4388600	Just in case in our forthcoming patch due within the next few weeks or sooner
4388920	4391160	Uh, we think the issue is due to a specific
4391480	4397640	Um drive hardware and possibly with uh bad blocks or sectors on your hard drive. So
4398520	4400520	interesting
4400520	4402520	Um, let's see here
4402520	4408300	Let's see here apparently nintendo of america has 100 we aware titles in development
4409480	4411480	I wonder how many of those are going to be crap
4412520	4414360	So that's interesting
4414360	4416520	And um, let's see here
4417880	4419960	There's some mobile games have been selling pretty well
4420520	4423500	Uh sonic mobile has hit 8 million downloads
4424200	4429960	Which is pretty amazing for a mobile game and guitar hero 3 mobile has made a 1 million
4429960	4432460	downloads, so that's kind of cool
4433100	4439660	Um, if you're interested in watching some original content from g4 or stuff that they used to have on their station
4440300	4442220	Um, you can check out
4442220	4443340	both
4443340	4448860	I think they have episodes of xplay on there now or attack of the show and stuff like that as well as
4449820	4451420	code monkeys
4451420	4453420	and I want to say there was a
4453420	4460780	Uh this block I guess which is um a snowboard documentary series that never really uh
4461580	4463580	debuted on the network
4464140	4470300	Huh, you know why they don't just put this stuff on their own network instead of I don't know cops marathons and cheaters
4470700	4472700	it's beyond me but
4472940	4474140	Who knows?
4474140	4476140	all right, and uh
4478140	4480380	That is pretty much it, all right
4480380	4484380	All right. Well that's gonna bring us to a close of another week of orange lounge radio
4484460	4488220	But not until we go around and get everybody's final thought loki your final thought tonight
