469	6330	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this live Part B that we're taping on June 1st of 2008.
6791	12452	And for those of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed, you're probably going, hey, wait a minute, I'm not hearing you guys live.
12472	13812	Well, you can always join us.
13872	21614	We tape live on allgames.com, that's All Games Radio, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern.
22174	28836	Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, the man in Atlanta, Georgia tapes his show live on Sunday nights as well.
28936	31877	And if you haven't heard his show, you really should check that out in iTunes.
32078	33638	We make appearances on the show every week.
33978	36879	Bobby's kind enough to have us on the show to do a little cross-promotion.
37640	46983	Speaking of taping the show live, you guys in the podcast didn't get to hear this, but we were actually listening to some of the tracks from the Metal Gear Solid 4 soundtrack during the break there.
47023	47923	What did you guys think of it?
47983	49584	I thought some of it sounded pretty awesome.
49884	50224	Nice help.
50484	52265	Epic soundtrack is epic.
52505	53846	Yes, epic soundtrack is very epic.
54247	57729	Loki, I know you were watching some more scenes from Postal there during the break.
58029	64933	Yeah, I'm an hour 11 into it, and it's an hour 47 minute movie.
65414	68075	Out of curiosity, those of you guys in chat, chat.orangellingerie.com.
68095	68836	Did you guys enjoy that?
69794	71535	Let us know in chat.
71935	76576	Meanwhile, we are going to get back into some gaming news here on this Part B. There's plenty of stuff to talk about.
76657	82939	I don't think we mentioned the Wii at all in Part A. I got, by the way, I got a game this week, Boom Blocks.
84219	86240	One of my friends kind of hooked me up with a copy of it.
86780	87760	Completely legitimate.
87820	90701	He just had some inside connections, got me a pretty cheap copy of it.
91182	92282	I'm looking forward to checking it out.
93362	94663	I'll have a review on that next week.
94983	97084	We're not going to talk about Boom Blocks right away, right?
97224	97304	No.
98024	98684	Portal, Still Alive DS
115930	120272	You remember the Flash game that they had out there that was kind of similar to Portal?
120552	124333	Well, this is kind of similar to that Flash game, a little bit more cartoony.
124533	131455	But if you own a Flash card or a means of putting Homebrew on your DS, you can download this game for free.
132416	133856	And it looks pretty awesome, actually.
134936	136457	Download it now before lawsuits.
137102	140423	I'm actually going to because I have a Ninja Pass.
140463	141523	Definitely worth checking out.
141543	147784	It uses the touch screen as well as some of the face buttons on there for launching different portals and stuff.
148304	149124	So, pretty cool.
150064	155345	I will have to play DarkSakura's copy because I don't think I'll be getting to check this out otherwise.
155365	157166	But it sounds interesting.
157686	158466	I'll hire a portal.
158846	164967	I'm definitely going to download that because, you know, me and my minor portal obsession, so I'll have to
165997	167378	Folks in chat are playing it right now.
167398	171161	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, ironically, I'm playing still live DS right now.
171561	173482	Let's have T says, it's rather hard to control.
173542	174943	How the hell do I shoot the orange one?
175303	176604	Maybe you guys can put your heads together.
177024	185090	The orange one is by pushing down on the directional pad or I want to say A. Or see if there's instructions and read them.
185210	189412	Down or A and the two shoulder buttons are the blue portals.
189532	190233	So that's how you do it.
191564	192325	Well, thank you very much.
192625	194606	You're like a Nintendo game counselor all of a sudden.
194646	194986	I love it.
195367	202752	Well, they have the screenshots of, or I guess artwork shots of the controls, so they're all over the internet.
204304	212226	All right, well, the latest issue of Japan's Famitsu magazine has given us some insight as to what's going on with the SimCity series.
212687	213227	Here's the deal.
213307	221149	SimCity Creator is going to be a new game in the SimCity vein, and it's going to be coming out for the Wii and the DS.
221529	230872	It's going to be coming out September 22nd of 2008 for North America and September 19th, a little bit earlier, for Europe and the Japan and other Asia regions.
231412	238580	And here's the interesting thing is that the Wii game, what you can do, you can draw your own rivers or tracks using the Wiimote.
239201	241524	You can actually change the different styles of your buildings as well.
241544	244527	You can do like a Chinese style building, an Indian design.
244887	245428	Kind of interesting.
245448	247871	You can also make buildings made out of candy.
248011	248091	Yeah.
248903	249664	or Christian.
250325	252046	Jamie got so excited she dropped the mic.
252306	253067	On my laptop.
253327	254749	She was like, ooh, a candy palace.
255590	257972	I was like saying, you know, you can do like a gingerbread house.
258132	263758	Well, it makes me think of the opening scene or one of the opening scenes in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the newer one.
264138	265920	Did you see the newer one with Johnny Depp?
265940	265980	No.
266500	267782	Oh, it's great.
268042	268743	That's all I'll say.
268783	271166	There's a scene with a chocolate Indian palace.
271226	271587	It's great.
272268	276953	Anyhow, also, it uses the Wi-Fi connection feature so you can show off the game to friends.
277554	281139	So that's kind of cool, especially when you draw those rivers shaped like penises.
282230	282790	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
311004	312685	Blade3 in chat got very excited.
312725	314647	He says, awesome, candy rules.
315347	316128	Candy does rule.
316368	317529	You can have Candyland.
317649	318149	It does depend.
318329	319931	Yeah, you could actually make Candyland.
320451	322232	That'd be great.
323113	325195	You could actually make Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.
325255	326335	That would be so awesome.
326355	326676	Yes.
327036	328517	I want a river of chocolate.
329097	329638	That's right.
330058	332120	And I want a wall that tastes like snozzleberry.
333200	361588	there's no such thing okay anyway for people interested in other culinary related games that are actually related to food there's going to be another Cooking Mama World Kitchen to be released later this year around October-ish they actually have Majesco has a coming soon with a release date of October 30th
362580	366201	It's also replacing Dinner with Friends.
366562	368322	As you remember, there was Cooking Moment 2 on the DS.
368682	375485	This was going to be Cooking Moment 2 on the Wii, but I don't know if they changed the title or are actually going to change the game.
376065	378366	It was supposed to be coming out in June, now it's in October.
378752	380313	They need to have Redneck Cookin' Mama.
380473	383655	Look, I'm... They have a game... We make fish sticks.
384376	385636	They have a game called Order Up.
385656	387057	My roommate just ate that for dinner.
387117	388859	Did you smell that inside the house or something?
388879	389899	That's hilarious.
389939	391320	No, actually... This is also Redneck Foods.
391500	392721	Fish sticks.
392841	393762	Funny you should mention that.
393822	395743	I walked in the house and I'm like, it smells good in here.
395783	396363	What'd you make for dinner?
396383	397124	What is it about fish sticks?
397264	397964	He said fish sticks.
398064	407430	No, I said... Funny that you should mention like a Redneck Cooking game because they're going to have Order Up, which is basically like Cooking Mama, but you're working at like a fast food restaurant.
407931	408091	Yeah.
408786	410266	They need to have truck stop diner.
410746	411446	That would be great.
411567	412507	Don't they have diner dash?
413007	413767	Yeah, same thing.
414707	414927	All right.
415787	416627	Anyhow, sorry.
417248	426349	Look, I just hope Cooking Mama Wii kind of blew chunks compared to the DS version, so I really hope they do a better DS to Wii port this time.
426369	429110	The closer you are to the screen, the more tight the control would be.
429190	430890	That's all I say.
431170	435511	I did not enjoy Cooking Mama on the Wii, although I own it, and I'm kind of upset I do.
436656	443538	Anyways, now the Wii was... The Virtual Console was supposed to be getting MSX games for quite a while.
444218	450939	Finally, Japan has had their first MSX game release, and it's a game called Aleste.
451760	460882	And what's kind of interesting, though, is that there's been some additional options to this game that no other Virtual Console game has, including the...
462582	478149	MSX option menu which allows you to select between the MSX hardware based music and the more advanced FM music that back when the MSX was actually a console was in add-on card.
478829	484651	So that's pretty cool that you can actually do this in the game by pressing the minus button.
486372	490534	I actually just think that it's cool that they're getting that game because it's a really freaking good game.
491104	495826	And you can also do, I guess, there's some button change options as well thrown in there.
495946	497966	So, I don't know.
498086	502968	That's kind of neat that they're adding all these options almost like an actual emulator for this.
503768	510531	I don't know why they don't do that with any of the other games that come out.
512151	514292	I hope we get Gartic with the deluxe treatment.
514312	514552	I know!
515649	516371	Thank you for watching!
523442	523682	All right.
524182	532188	Anyhow, Toki Tori is a game that is coming to the North American virtual console, WiiWare.
532308	534149	I guess it's not really a virtual console, but you know WiiWare.
535169	540053	It's a 2D puzzle game, and it's going to cost you 1,000 points or 10 bucks.
540533	541353	So there you have it.
542074	545376	Apparently, this game's been fairly well-reviewed.
545476	546217	It's a little puzzle game.
546237	546657	I didn't like it.
547057	547517	You didn't like it?
547557	547938	You played it?
548138	548378	Yeah.
548438	548998	Can you describe it?
549018	550119	Because I don't know much about this game.
550159	551140	It looks like... I don't know.
551160	553921	I look at screenshots and I go, it looks a little Lode Runner-ish to me.
554001	554402	Sort of.
554482	557524	You collect the eggs, basically, and then that's pretty much it.
557664	562186	I mean, you can hop around, jump different platforms with motion controls and stuff like that.
562927	563267	I don't know.
563287	564788	It might be cool later on.
564948	568590	I didn't give it that much time, but it wasn't something that I was interested in.
568610	569651	Is it like Time Bird?
571072	571652	I don't know about that.
572213	574234	But yeah, it's very basic, but...
576311	577552	Well, how about something different?
588300	589040	Sure, different.
589200	590241	Virtual Console!
590881	591161	Woohoo!
591321	592121	At least in the UK.
593801	600943	Games out this time around are... We have Hello Pokemon Puzzle League.
601443	602304	I'm sorry, why did I say hello?
602684	603584	I'm reading from the thing.
603624	608705	It says Pokemon Puzzle League has come out.
610226	611086	There's also...
614116	623003	Samurai Shodown, which makes me perfectly happy because it's the actual Neo Geo versions for their Neo Geo virtual console stuff.
623883	627646	And actually it's going to be out for 900 Wii points, which is 630.
628466	635771	Oh, and before I forget to mention, Pokemon Puzzle League is 1,000 points.
636712	639934	Burning Fight is also the other one that's out today.
641375	646399	for 800 points, which is sort of like a Streets of Rage type brawler.
646439	647479	So, there you go.
649801	650061	Cool.
651102	653083	I would download these games if I had room.
654004	655565	Yeah, that does suck.
657296	659158	I don't like having to delete stuff to make room.
659758	661379	Room sucks.
661819	665822	There's a game coming out in the US actually that Japan's had for a while now.
665882	667423	It's a game called Tornado.
668203	670525	And a lot of you may not be familiar with this game.
670565	673567	It's actually very similar to Katamari Damacy.
674307	680411	And the game entails you playing a creature that basically becomes a tornado and you have to
681131	688718	Much like Katamari, suck up smaller objects and make your tornado bigger and then you can suck up larger objects and stuff like that.
688918	689779	Tasmanian Devil?
690399	691120	Something like that.
691940	695463	And we'll be coming out on the DS in the fall.
695583	699086	I want to say September, I thought.
699106	701088	I thought I saw this in September.
701628	702269	I could be wrong though.
703137	708780	But yeah, it's kind of neat and kind of a little quirky game that will be coming out here a little bit later on.
708961	710682	So keep an eye out for that.
713083	714224	Is this something you've actually played?
714704	717266	I haven't played it, but I've just seen screenshots and video of it.
718947	720247	Could this be the next big thing?
720267	721748	I don't think it's going to be a big thing.
721768	722949	It'll be a quirky little game though.
724130	725871	It'll be like worth checking out at least.
727392	727892	All right, well.
728548	730490	Alan Carr's Novel, The Easy Way to Stop Smoking
748527	758253	And what the game will do, this game's coming out in November, what you do, you pick a coach, I guess, in this game, and you create a program based on your smoking habit.
758753	771982	And basically what the easy way method does is that you educate smokers about how addiction happens, convince them that whatever type of great feelings you get from smoking, you get from...
773142	775364	I guess you can curb that stuff.
776305	778527	And you try to stop the emotional dependency.
778908	780409	So it's kind of strange, though.
780449	782771	This is all coming out as a video game.
783232	785694	So this is, I don't know, interesting.
785754	787355	Not really strange for Ubisoft.
788396	790658	I want to know, though, are there Rabbids in this?
790778	791859	Because, you know, that would be funny.
792260	792380	No.
792400	793341	I need to stop smoking.
793361	793401	Ah!
796673	800454	I think it's interesting that the DS is branching out like this, so to speak.
800554	804596	I mean, brain draining has kind of led to a lot of these outside-the-box type games.
804977	805937	But I'm going to tell you what.
806717	808098	I used to be a smoker, and I quit.
808138	811540	Granted, I was not a very heavy smoker, but enough where I was addicted.
812720	814221	In my mind, I don't know.
814261	815522	This might be a personal opinion.
815542	816622	I'll probably get hate mail over this.
816702	824226	But the only way you can quit is to, when you say, I'm going to quit, quit, and then do it cold turkey.
825748	828469	But it's one of those things where when you say it, mean it.
829029	831350	But I didn't have that huge dependency either.
831710	833310	So maybe that's how I was able to get away with the patch.
833330	839732	What this game does, though, is when you have the urge to buy cigarettes, it gives you different Ubisoft game options that you could purchase.
840193	845074	So it's like, instead of buying a pack of cigarettes, how about you buy quick yoga?
845894	847135	Or Far Cry.
847615	848355	Yeah, Far Cry.
848655	851096	Or how about purchase the My Weight Loss Coach?
851276	852256	It comes with a pedometer.
853197	853757	Stuff like that.
854437	855478	That's how this game's gonna work.
855878	859020	Frisbee says, can't wait till Alcoholic Hero comes out for the TS.
860300	861301	What do you think, DarkSakura?
861321	862562	Do you think this will be an effective game?
863883	866864	I think that any tool is effective if someone believes in it.
868445	879952	It's a lot of it has to do with willpower and whatever... And I hate to use this term, but if the crutch works for you, then use it.
880332	880612	I mean...
882282	882783	I don't know.
883443	884605	I'm kind of iffy about it.
884645	893635	Just anyone who says that anything is easy is usually trying to... I mean, they are trying to sell you something.
894095	897439	They're trying to feed you crap when all you need to do is just
898999	899560	It's willpower.
899800	903905	And I know not a lot of people have a lot of willpower, and I know that it is a physical addiction.
904065	906228	It is a drug, and people are addicted to it.
906989	910673	However, it's one that withdrawing from will not kill you.
911194	912195	You just have to ride it out.
912735	915559	Listen, has anyone learned anything from Metal Gear?
915799	916760	I mean, seriously.
916880	917922	You can eat tree frogs.
918723	919524	No, no.
919944	921225	Look at what happened to Snake.
921245	927350	Because he smokes cigarettes, he has to fight this crazy war, fight giant mechs.
927370	928831	Do you really want to fight giant mechs?
928951	930713	He smuggled his smokes in his stomach.
932154	933095	This is why...
935731	936492	I don't know, I have nothing.
936732	945838	But really, this game is stupid, and if you're suckered into buying it, then I'm sure Nintendo has a few other training programs that they can send your way, including vision training.
945978	948520	I'm sure they're going to have hearing training coming up soon.
948780	949401	Poop training.
949521	950101	Poop training.
951663	953344	Consumer horror training.
953884	954405	And how.
955866	958728	No, and again, I'm going to stick by this.
960769	962911	Anything is possible if you're willing to work for it.
964883	967224	Anything worth having is worth putting effort into, right?
967244	968545	Yeah.
969465	970846	It just depends on how much you want it.
971686	979529	My whole thing is that if you really, really, really want to quit smoking, if you really want to do it, you don't need a game.
980449	981169	You'll just do it.
981430	983430	A game might help, but you don't need it.
983510	990513	It's not like heroin, you know, where you could, you know, I guess have a bunch of complications from withdrawal, but...
991152	996399	If you need to buy a book to tell you how to quit something, that's retarded.
997139	997780	I'm sorry.
998081	999122	It is retarded.
1000644	1001024	Seriously.
1002106	1003167	How do I quit something?
1003187	1004769	Stop doing it.
1006251	1008033	Do you really need to buy a book for that?
1012810	1020312	I'm going to say this because I will freely admit that there's lots of things that I have kind of poor willpower about.
1020993	1030075	But I think that if you just sort of say, nothing changes until you are ready to make it change and then do what you need to do to make it change, right?
1030976	1035217	So I think that you just have to want it bad enough to put the effort into it.
1035537	1036857	If you want it bad enough, you'll do it.
1037437	1038338	That's what I think.
1039867	1044771	All right, well, we'll see how this game does and what type of floodgates it'll open if it does really well.
1045472	1046573	In the meantime, let's talk about smoking.
1046593	1050035	However, I have no pity for people who say, I can't stop smoking and hold a cigarette in their hand.
1051557	1051737	Yeah.
1052157	1052537	You can do it.
1053278	1054199	I wish my mom would quit.
1054619	1058943	Anyway, guess what is coming out in Japan?
1059343	1062225	A bunch of stuff, including the gardening game.
1062485	1063106	Poop training?
1063786	1066048	Is poop training coming out in Japan?
1066248	1069171	You know, they actually have toilet training cartoons.
1070289	1071090	I'm sorry I asked.
1071110	1072212	With a toilet that sings to you.
1072653	1073734	I'm sorry I asked.
1073754	1075997	And poop that laughs as it exits the body.
1076578	1078440	I'm really sorry I asked.
1078841	1079522	They're funny, though.
1080043	1083167	Anyway, they're getting a Fatal Frame 4...
1085123	1090167	If you like your gory ghost games, then that one is definitely going to be the one to go for.
1090227	1096072	But it's by Tecmo Grasshopper Manufacturer Collaboration putting this out together.
1096352	1100956	And Fatal Frame 4 can be also called Poltergeist Snap.
1101056	1101936	Poltergeist Snap?
1102037	1102757	I like that.
1103298	1104198	That's a good name for that.
1104238	1104639	I like that.
1105119	1107621	But basically you go around and shoot pictures of dead people.
1107761	1108061	The end.
1110243	1112585	Does your character at any point go, I see dead people?
1113965	1115226	I develop film of dead people.
1116546	1117967	It's only porn if you tape it.
1119788	1130373	Instead of Fatal Frame, they should have Fatal Cam where you videotape certain places and then have to run it through a spectral analysis to have everything show up on film.
1130553	1136596	I'm still waiting for WhatTheyPlay.com Snap because that was the picture-taking game I was looking forward to.
1136876	1137097	Rob.
1137657	1137837	What?
1139058	1139258	What?
1139318	1139438	Okay.
1143527	1143927	Raving Rabbids
1166900	1176522	TV Party and you sit on the balance board and use your ass to play different mini games in Rayman's Raving Rabbids.
1179803	1182224	They're kind of a party game sort of situation there.
1182844	1193747	One of the games they show is actually sliding down a hill on what looks like an upside down moose and you are using your ass to balance yourself as you go down the hill.
1194287	1194907	I don't know, kind of fun.
1195874	1196194	Moose.
1196774	1199215	Other options they're going to have in the game, too, are other minigames.
1199455	1206517	They're going to have a dancing minigame where you have to do different things, different poses and stuff, which will also use the balance board.
1206537	1209058	So it looks kind of neat.
1209518	1211519	And, of course, the raving rabbits are very funny.
1212079	1213679	This needs to become a sitcom.
1214560	1218461	The rabbits, just in ordinary life, kind of like a Garfield thing.
1218541	1219021	That'd be funny.
1219918	1223281	Should do like Joe's Apartment, but with... Yeah, yeah.
1223301	1224382	I like where you're going there.
1224623	1225504	Yeah, exactly.
1226504	1229247	So if it's like Garfield, will there be a Nermal?
1230228	1231009	That's what I want to know.
1231331	1233192	You know I had to go back and read that again, Rob.
1233472	1233712	What?
1233912	1236634	Garfield minus Garfield is excellent.
1238154	1239875	Dan and I had a discussion about this.
1240556	1254802	We've decided that just looking at that either John Arbuckle, the main guy, is either really, really, really sad or mad, like Looney Tunes.
1254883	1255743	Maybe a little of both.
1257504	1257804	I don't know.
1258820	1269405	Well, you know what makes me really, really sad and then really, really mad is the fact that I can't find Wii Fit anywhere because the game sold out as fast as it came out and that is not yet back on shelves.
1269905	1278830	And one of those crazy game industry analysts, Michael Patcher, talked to the LA Times about the Wii Fit supply and how it's so short.
1279990	1282392	But it's very interesting what he says is the reason for this.
1282732	1284593	It's because of the value of the dollar.
1285594	1288499	The shortage demonstrates one consequence of the weak dollar.
1288840	1293809	We're seeing companies ignore their largest market simply because they can make greater profit elsewhere.
1294731	1297816	They know that Americans will be just as fat a few months from now.
1300115	1306399	Even though there has been about half a million copies of Wii Fit shipped to the US, there have already been about 2 million in Europe.
1307140	1308040	Kind of interesting.
1308100	1312263	Those things are going at really crazy prices on eBay.
1312423	1314584	Like $180 and stuff like that.
1314864	1315445	That's dumb.
1315805	1317386	It's just like Wii's when they first came out.
1317466	1318447	Same thing.
1319487	1321909	Alpha Canogram in chat says, Sky should have pre-ordered it.
1322189	1323930	Here's the thing, I didn't know if the game would be any good.
1323990	1326592	That's a lot of money to drop on a game you don't know that much about.
1326612	1327112	Yeah.
1327452	1327812	Yeah, I know.
1328533	1333676	And then honestly, though, I think they're giving... They kind of blame everything on the weak US dollar now.
1334116	1334856	Oh, there's a shortage.
1335076	1336697	Must be the weak US dollar.
1337098	1339519	I don't really think they put that much thought into it, to be honest.
1339599	1348624	I think it's just... They fucked up yet again, and so... I mean, because what would be the point of releasing... Like, for example, Mario Kart.
1348644	1349545	There was a shortage...
1350345	1353747	The week it came out, and then there was a lot more later on next week.
1354328	1357630	So you're telling me that the dollar turned around within that week.
1357990	1359291	I somehow doubt that.
1359691	1367817	Much like I doubt that once these stores get replenished with more product, that, oh, it's because the dollar turned around.
1367897	1370638	No, I think it's just because they're retard and poor planning.
1370658	1371259	That's all it is.
1373903	1378504	Akuma JP is one of our listeners in Japan and he says there's fit everywhere here.
1378964	1385566	Granted, the game's been out a lot longer there, but what I thought was interesting that he said is a lot of used here, so I think it's not that good.
1386026	1388226	So apparently a lot of them are being turned right around in Japan.
1388246	1389086	You can ship one to me.
1389926	1390327	I'll play it.
1390807	1392427	Can we play it on the American Wiis though?
1392447	1393387	They're region locked, right?
1394487	1394968	I think you can.
1394988	1396468	We can get the... Can you?
1396528	1400009	Didn't they figure out the... It's just the weight limit's not as high.
1400189	1401549	I think they patched the freeloader.
1402148	1403249	Yeah, the Freeloader should work now.
1403449	1406830	Actually, remember that homebrew channel that we were talking about last week?
1407231	1415215	They have the Gecko Freeloader that you can use on there, which is a basically region-free player for your Wii games.
1415475	1415715	Nice.
1415915	1416415	And it's homebrew.
1416735	1417096	And free.
1417516	1419877	SSJ100Matt says, I can't get my porn.
1419897	1421158	It must be the weak US dollar.
1423199	1423859	Can't get his porn.
1425308	1430049	Well, if that were the case, then we wouldn't be able to buy any games because everyone would be selling them in different regions.
1430089	1431150	That's just retarded.
1431210	1433491	You know, they say porn is rescission-proof.
1434111	1434451	I don't know.
1435211	1435571	We'll see.
1436151	1439672	CrunkyBoyJr says, I'm sure Nintendo does this on purpose to create a demand.
1439692	1440213	They do.
1440613	1441733	I mean, seriously.
1442053	1443213	This is retarded now.
1443874	1447355	They want this to be the big Christmas item, and that's what they're going to do.
1447415	1453637	They're going to make this just like the Wii system, and it's going to be a shortage for like a year and a half.
1454177	1454617	You watch.
1455794	1456394	All right, we'll see.
1456814	1459035	All right, let's see what you, the listener, have to say.
1459095	1462595	You can always email us every week, mailbag at orangelaundrader.com.
1462615	1469357	And every week, DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorite emails and reads them to you in a little segment we call the OLR Mailbag.
1469977	1473238	So, DarkSakura, dive in to mailbag at orangelaundrader.com.
1473578	1475438	Pull out a few of your favorites and read them.
1478279	1480019	None of them were my favorites, so the end.
1481804	1482625	Nice try.
1483885	1485746	Okay, this one comes from Cheeseburger.
1486127	1488948	I'm finally reading one of your emails, so leave me alone.
1490409	1495232	Hey guys, I'm going to get an Xbox 360 Pro soon and I want some recommendations.
1495852	1499474	Also, I got my first BSOD after playing six hours of StarCraft.
1499814	1501175	I never found out what the problem was.
1501595	1503196	Dude, you're playing six hours of StarCraft.
1503456	1504217	It's probably heat.
1506178	1507639	Dude, StarCraft's pretty awesome though.
1507719	1510701	Or your computer's like, stop playing StarCraft!
1510741	1511361	Play something else.
1511381	1511461	Fuck!
1513212	1518635	It's such a broad question though about the whole Xbox 360 recommendations.
1518675	1520276	What do you like?
1520376	1521156	It really depends.
1521556	1524498	Tell us some games that you do like and that'll be good.
1524818	1532722	I guess otherwise games that everybody seems to like, at least if you're listening to this show, I can kind of already tell you probably must like the RPG.
1532742	1537424	You're not as into sports games, let's say, because we don't talk a lot about those unless it's like Tecmo Bowl.
1537884	1539505	Geometry Wars Marvel Ultimate Alliance
1568136	1570577	You can get that on multiple systems.
1570817	1573878	Yeah, but I still go back and play that all the time.
1574698	1576098	What if you're a racing game fan?
1576118	1578699	What's one of the better racing games on Xbox 360, you think?
1580700	1582960	I still like the last Burnout game.
1583300	1584801	Project Gotham 3 was okay.
1585261	1586981	Yeah, I guess it depends.
1587061	1592663	Orange Box suggests Actdeft, which is definitely Portal and other great shooter games if you like first-person shooters.
1594458	1597764	Tiger Claw, Samus is not in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, it's Iron Man.
1599167	1606889	No, Samus is in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, or was going to be in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but got cut out for the Wii version.
1608929	1616991	Someone found it in the PlayStation 2 version, because you know the code that they just edit out or whatever, or comment out.
1617271	1618091	That's kind of interesting.
1618151	1619892	Okay, I'm going to have to find this then.
1620912	1621532	Oh my god.
1621552	1622972	There's a video out there.
1623032	1624273	I think Kotaku ran it.
1624313	1625633	I want to see maybe even Joystick.
1626969	1627769	Alright, so there you go.
1627809	1628770	There's some suggestions.
1628970	1634491	If you want more, I guess, tell us what kind of games you do like and that'll give us some places to start.
1635731	1637552	Anyway, next email.
1637632	1638112	Can I read it?
1638152	1638732	Can I?
1638812	1639132	Of course.
1639732	1640873	Okay.
1640953	1642593	This comes from Lycan.
1643774	1644574	Hey, OLR.
1645114	1645434	Hi.
1645994	1646374	Hey.
1646654	1649355	I just thought that I would say hi and keep up the good work.
1649515	1656117	I was just wondering if any of you have seen the video of using the Wii with WoW and if not, I'll send it to you.
1657812	1660133	He did send a link to it, but I'm not going to watch it.
1661554	1666256	He said he thinks it's going to like our comments, but why don't we watch it and comment back on it next week?
1666777	1669698	I guess so, because I've heard of it, but I haven't really watched it.
1670158	1672700	So Jamie, it'll be your responsibility to make sure we watch it for next week.
1674180	1674981	Okay.
1675041	1676181	Oh, I have hiccups now.
1677582	1678082	Next email!
1678823	1679203	Yes, ma'am.
1679502	1680322	Hey, OLR.
1680582	1680983	Hey.
1681723	1690407	I've been listening to your awesome show for some time now, and I was just wondering what kinds of places you get your news-slash-release dates from.
1690967	1693848	If you can't read it on air or don't feel like revealing them, it's no big deal.
1693948	1694708	I was just curious.
1694849	1695209	Thanks.
1695689	1696049	P.S.
1696169	1700491	Breadsticks are brought to you by this email home of the never-ending Olive Gardens by Amplitude.
1702161	1703222	Amplitude.
1703703	1709148	Between the three of us, we probably look at like a hundred different gaming news sites and blogs out there on the internet.
1709629	1711511	And I'll tell you a little bit about how it works behind the scenes.
1711531	1718678	Behind the scenes, we keep a little thread in a private forum that nobody but the hosts and some of the other OLR people who've worked with us for many years can see.
1719078	1723343	And basically, when stories are interesting, we put them in this post and then we
1723723	1724383	Thank you for watching!
1746133	1755418	I will say, though, where I get my release dates from, since it's come up on the show as a question before, is that I do actually get my release dates from Eurogamer, which is just great overall.
1755638	1757919	And I get my Japanese release dates from import game stores.
1758399	1759099	There you go.
1759600	1768244	Although sometimes I will use, just on my own, I will actually use some of the video game retailers in the UK to verify a few dates.
1768424	1774507	But now, on the other hand, Loki sometimes has insider info on the US release dates thanks to, you know, the stuff that he does, so...
1774727	1775367	GS68 says, What is OLR?
1775407	1776548	A miserable little pile of secrets.
1800799	1804262	I want to point out there's other people that contribute to the stories you hear on the show.
1804342	1806843	DarkTetsuya also posts in our thread.
1807304	1811446	And once in a while, Travis Donovan and DMN poke their head in there when they see something really interesting.
1811546	1815989	So it's not just the three of us that contribute the stories, but just everywhere.
1816029	1819712	We have our eyes everywhere.
1819772	1830019	The terrorist story from Part A was actually a link given to me last night by my friend who's busy doing a programming test applying for Namco.
1831600	1833361	And she's like, I'm tired of doing this.
1833421	1834101	Here, look at these links.
1834121	1834501	They're funny.
1834781	1835262	You never know.
1835582	1837783	So I get them from people.
1837803	1840524	The other week I actually got from Ranma, so that was cool.
1841225	1841465	All right.
1841925	1843226	So next email.
1843326	1844466	Dun, dun, dun.
1844786	1845767	Thank you, Amplitude.
1846467	1848868	And it's Amplitude with a Y, so I'm saying Amplitude.
1850229	1851870	All right, this comes from Kevin.
1851890	1851990	Kevin.
1853919	1854619	Hi, Kevin.
1869546	1879891	It's in San Jose and you can read all the info at www.caexpo.com or just California Extreme into Google and Firefox, your rail bar, blah, blah, blah.
1880151	1885173	It'll be my first time going and it would be a kick to see what anyone else thinks of it from their first time.
1885974	1887294	Keep up the good work and join the show.
1887715	1888515	I hit the fair by accident.
1888575	1890896	And join the show as I'm typing from work, huh, Kevin?
1891176	1893497	We won't tell your boss, Kevin, because I do this all the time too.
1894578	1896799	I have never been to California Extreme, but I want to go this year.
1897546	1900948	We actually ran into Mel and Melody there last year.
1901728	1904230	They had a hotel, and they live there.
1904250	1904930	I think that's funny.
1906491	1907472	Sometimes you want to get away.
1907612	1909032	Last year, in what?
1909132	1909873	Where everyone knows your name?
1910713	1918358	Anyway, last year was my second California Extreme, and it's just a freaking blast.
1919658	1925141	First of all, it's air-conditioned, which gives it major, major points over Pentagogo right then and there.
1925161	1926182	Yeah.
1927839	1932301	It's like you go up to the desk, you pay your money, you walk in, PINBALL!
1933222	1934102	Oh my god!
1934523	1941626	And it's not just pinball too, it's old classic games, like they had the Journey game there, Rob.
1942747	1944208	That's why I'm fucking sold on this.
1944448	1947069	I played a full game of Space Harrier.
1947189	1948590	I beat Space Harrier, Rob.
1949250	1950271	But it's all on free play, right?
1950331	1951131	Exactly!
1951311	1952152	Oh, we're definitely going.
1953245	1953766	Definitely go on.
1953846	1956028	They had... Oh, God, what else was it?
1956088	1965837	They had that game where you slide a pole back and forth and you're sort of like a tug-of-war game where you... Oh, I thought it was Incredible Maze or whatever that game was.
1965877	1966538	No, no, no, no, no.
1966638	1969981	It's where you have to either run them into or push it from the other side.
1970001	1972703	It's whoever's stronger, but you win matches out of it.
1972783	1973724	And I actually... I beat...
1974725	1975305	Who did I beat?
1975425	1976666	I don't remember who I beat.
1977446	1977967	I beat Will.
1978307	1978907	That was who I beat.
1979047	1981889	So look, there's your long answer to the short answer of yes, we're going.
1981989	1982609	There's more.
1983049	1985230	We asked for opinions of whoever had their first time.
1985851	1990173	They also, it is an Ultracade sort of show-off type place.
1990613	1992474	So they do have Ultra Pin there.
1992814	1993515	They did last year.
1994135	2002139	And Ultra Pin is a plasma TV the size of a pinball table with LEDs and everything up and it emulates different tables.
2002199	2004020	And it's just really cool.
2004660	2006462	and they also have room with machines for sale.
2006642	2012987	So if you want to take home a bit of classic joy, you can nab a machine for cheap.
2013007	2013888	They had Alpine Racing.
2013908	2015129	They're like, who's going to take that home?
2015929	2017150	Sorry, no one has room for that.
2020753	2030141	And I'll tell you what, if you want to meet up, because I'm definitely going to go, shoot another email and we'll make arrangements for meeting up there.
2030161	2031422	Do they do panels there or anything?
2031802	2032883	I do believe they do panels.
2033123	2033984	Maybe we ought to look into that.
2034386	2035407	Alright, we'll have to see.
2036007	2038348	But California Extreme is just tons of fun.
2038568	2039189	Tons of fun.
2040269	2041610	Oh god, really long email.
2043211	2044411	Long email is long.
2044672	2045952	Long email is long.
2046152	2048734	But, but, but, but, but, this is from Katamari's Forever.
2050095	2050735	So I'm going to read it.
2052356	2052616	What?
2052636	2052736	What?
2054185	2054726	Sorry.
2055026	2056848	He's watching that movie while you're reading emails.
2056928	2057169	I know.
2057249	2058170	I'm watching something else.
2058190	2058891	Alright.
2058991	2059451	What is it?
2059631	2060172	Now you gotta tell.
2060192	2060793	Ferret porn?
2061253	2062715	It's a cat battle bot.
2063015	2065658	It's a battle bot that is controlled by a cat.
2066239	2067260	And it rides in it.
2067420	2068842	And that is the coolest thing ever.
2069222	2069923	Oh my god.
2070263	2071445	I posted a link already in chat.
2071565	2072005	Oh my god.
2072085	2073367	Okay, can I read this okay?
2075902	2077082	Good evening, OLR.
2077162	2080103	I trust you have had a pleasant weekend so far.
2080784	2087326	Anyway, since I didn't write a letter for the past couple of weeks, I wanted to put out a few things out of the open.
2087466	2096009	With the school year ending in a couple of weeks for me, and the raging sense of boredom I feel I'm going to get, I decided to stock up on summer games!
2097629	2107292	Since the titles coming out in the June, July, August months are slim pickings, I've got more than enough games to hold me over from the A-list Wii titles to Lost via Domus.
2109393	2117736	While I live close to the border to Canada, I frequently shop there, and Canadian EB Games already has a game day sale out late June.
2118136	2126799	I can't wait for the summer sales here, and I hope I can find a copy of Rez, PS2 version, I don't have a 360, or, excuse me, Guitar Man for dirt cheap.
2128140	2133085	Anything you're looking forward to playing other than WoW, Ragnarok, and GTA 4?
2135327	2136368	I want the world to end with you.
2136388	2138690	And I want the Iron Man game.
2139851	2140572	I'm being denied.
2142614	2142854	Guys?
2144596	2145356	Games we want?
2145797	2146177	Yeah.
2146457	2147739	You're looking forward to playing in the summer.
2151102	2151562	I don't know.
2153122	2155583	I have to be honest, not a lot I can think of right now.
2155603	2158263	Wii Fit, whenever I can get my hands on it, I think will be fun to play.
2159323	2161204	Especially after the little demo I had the other week.
2161264	2163904	But as far as games I'm really looking forward to, I can't think of a lot right now.
2163924	2165305	Are you going to hula hoop in your underwear?
2165325	2165385	Huh?
2165405	2166505	Are you going to hula hoop in your underwear?
2166625	2167225	I just might.
2167265	2168225	We should get you some underoos.
2169126	2169546	No, thank you.
2171146	2172346	Matt, were you looking forward to anything?
2174667	2180148	I was looking forward to Saints Row 2, but I can't now because...
2181147	2181808	later news.
2182008	2184710	Final Fantasy 4 DS, if that ever comes out.
2184770	2185971	I don't think that's coming out this summer.
2186211	2186752	Is it this summer?
2186932	2188153	Yeah, it's the end of July.
2188173	2189294	Oh, and the Civilization game.
2189414	2189874	So there you go.
2190434	2190695	Okay.
2191255	2194878	I'm looking forward to... I thought I might be looking forward to Grid.
2195298	2196619	I'm not sure if I'm going to pick that up.
2196659	2200643	I think the next game I have on order is... Oh, shit.
2200983	2203705	It was Good to Heart Hero on DS, but I don't think I want that anymore.
2204786	2204866	Um...
2207250	2207530	I don't know.
2207731	2214437	I may just get one of those DS R4s or R6s or wherever they are now and just homebrew.
2214718	2216800	I might buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith for laughs.
2218537	2221519	I'm going to continue because I don't know.
2221719	2222079	Please do.
2222999	2226821	What I'm still waiting for is my Okami covers.
2226921	2227342	Me too.
2227442	2227722	Hi.
2228242	2233044	I ordered one the week of when you said how to get one and I'm still waiting for it a month after.
2233385	2234345	Have you gotten your cover yet?
2234505	2234705	No.
2235085	2235766	And does it look cool?
2235806	2236286	Probably.
2238707	2239609	I'll find out.
2239849	2240771	It looks cool on the website.
2241492	2248462	And well, after reading some rave reviews and some really odd statistics, I picked up a copy of Grand Theft Childhood from my local library.
2248963	2254311	While I haven't read a whole lot of it, finals week soon, have to cram, I have to say I'm quite impressed.
2254631	2263864	They somehow debunk all of the gaming myths such as violence and sex and shed some light on the hot topics like what girls actually play and how violent video games reduce stress.
2264344	2269010	I can't wait to finish it as well as my newly acquired copy of Katamari Damacy.
2271133	2272135	I have to say I was...
2273829	2279593	I was a little five-year-old boy again after hearing the news about DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 last week.
2280093	2288099	While I know most of the world has moved on with other lavish music games, I'm still anticipating the release of one of the best franchises Japan has ever given birth to.
2288820	2291822	I must be the only one in Michigan who cares about this now.
2292062	2294884	Speaking of Konami, are they... What, Rob?
2294904	2295684	You're grabbing the mic.
2296565	2296925	No, nothing.
2296945	2297686	Is it for support?
2298126	2300228	Yeah, just getting ready in case I think of a witty comment.
2300328	2300568	Okay.
2301049	2305833	Speaking of Konami, are they really serious in releasing Rock Revolution in its current form?
2306253	2310557	I mean, they should just change the engine to Unreal 3.1 and put arrows instead of colored cues.
2311117	2322547	But really, Konami and Bemani should just release a guitar-slash-drum-freakish type game and ditch the rock-and-roll-is-in vibe that just makes them sing like copycats of their own concept.
2323508	2331794	and hopefully the DLC in Hottest Party 2 will be one unlockable key that unlocks everything and more for just 200 points or less.
2332174	2333575	We could hope, but will they?
2333775	2334316	Probably not.
2334976	2335697	Three more things.
2336337	2337438	Thank you for giving us a countdown.
2338099	2339439	How's Dr. Mario online?
2339960	2341821	Can you really send Wii friends a demo?
2342882	2343963	From what I understand, yes.
2344163	2346745	Somebody has sent me a demo, but I haven't bought the game myself yet.
2347405	2349246	And we don't get copies because we're not special.
2349347	2351048	So we have to buy them just like you.
2352085	2355408	Rob, are you going to Penny Arcade Expo?
2355488	2356368	That's the plan.
2356569	2359991	I will know for sure in a couple weeks, but I am planning on going.
2360692	2364635	And Ferret, are you really going to be in a horror movie as the slasher that kills everyone?
2364935	2366476	I think we should let the ferret answer that, don't you think?
2368758	2371740	I don't think you should give... Oh, you shouldn't give so much plot details away.
2373081	2374663	Ferret's... You know what, Ferret?
2376624	2377785	Okay, that's good enough, baby.
2378365	2380187	I like the other one that made the different noises.
2380580	2381781	I know the wolfy looking one.
2381861	2382562	That one's kind of cool.
2383143	2383403	Okay.
2384544	2386706	I regret that this letter is very super long.
2387627	2391090	It's just that I had to say was on my mind and I really didn't have the time until now.
2391171	2395315	Until then, your favorite emailer freeway shuffling to the next DVR iteration.
2395615	2396576	Katamari's forever.
2396976	2397337	P.S.
2397497	2403403	This message should be brought to you by the Olive Garden, but instead it's currently asking permission to be endorsed by Bobby Blackwolf.
2404702	2408966	Although, as Katamari's Forever wrote, Boobie Blackwell.
2409466	2409887	Best typo ever.
2409907	2410827	Maybe that's his cousin.
2411208	2412409	It's a typo, but it's funny.
2413189	2414230	Two more emails and they're little.
2414511	2415351	Alright, are they short?
2415652	2415872	Yes.
2416152	2416512	J-Rod.
2416552	2416833	Hi, guys.
2421499	2422600	Hi, J-Rod.
2422940	2423761	Just a quick comment.
2423901	2433386	I was just listening to episode 279 at work the other day when Loki started his rant about Wii Fit and how Nintendo is just trying to find a new market of soccer moms and people who watch Oprah.
2433927	2437068	By the end of his rant, I found myself almost clapping with my headphones on.
2437228	2439210	Again, Loki echoes my thoughts around the world.
2439790	2443212	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of never-ending salads and breadsticks.
2443812	2444573	Don't encourage him.
2446054	2446914	I didn't say anything.
2446934	2447494	He said it.
2447674	2448135	Not me.
2448275	2448515	Heart.
2451684	2452484	You know he likes it.
2452764	2460867	Anyway, I was just wondering if you were going to do a show on a Saturday on a long weekend like you talked about a while back.
2461327	2464408	OLR goes past midnight where I live and I have to get up at 5 in the morning.
2464768	2468649	The show is comedy gold and I will listen until it is long dead like DDR.
2469229	2471269	Thanks for putting on such a good show week after week.
2471349	2471670	And that's BHK667.
2473680	2479028	I don't know so much about Saturday, but we did talk about doing a show around noontime, so we should still make sure that happens at some point.
2480310	2481071	Sometime over the summer.
2481312	2482213	You know what we should do?
2482614	2483916	Although it would probably kill us.
2484056	2484276	What?
2484737	2486099	Do an all-night marathon.
2486159	2487882	No way we'd die.
2488002	2488643	Do you know I'm not...
2488923	2494667	No, I remember what happened when we did a marathon show at the tournament we had at Scandia.
2494887	2496908	That wasn't fun, because you run out of things to talk about.
2497929	2507915	If we found something, though, to keep things interesting, like maybe rotating out old classic video games for a night or something, or we did it for charity or something, there might be a reason to do it.
2508575	2508975	I don't know.
2509075	2510256	Maybe Labor Day weekend.
2510736	2511537	But don't hold your breath.
2513358	2514479	Alright, so that's it for emails?
2515673	2535945	if you would like to contribute, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to go for now, more gaming news so as I kind of hinted when we were talking about games for the summer sorry, hold on, Black Wolf reminded me Labor Day weekend is the same as PAX for some reason I thought it was the weekend before so what's the next three day weekend after Labor Day weekend?
2536286	2543290	maybe Thanksgiving that's not a three day weekend, Rob it's a four day weekend it's a four day pre-weekend whatever
2544983	2545824	I probably won't be here.
2546744	2549526	How about... I don't know.
2549566	2550647	Let's make up our own holiday.
2552368	2552889	Seriously.
2552949	2553829	We'll figure something out.
2553869	2554710	We'll make up a holiday.
2554910	2555450	OLR day.
2556231	2556731	That's it.
2556771	2557812	We have OLR day.
2558212	2559333	And we can all take off from work.
2559954	2560294	We'll see.
2560314	2560614	We'll see.
2561014	2562295	Okay.
2562555	2562836	Anyways.
2563436	2565097	Saints Row 2 has been deleted to October 14th.
2566680	2576850	And, you know, because I would imagine that Grand Theft Auto 4 is so awesome, so, you know, they have to spend the extra time making sure that Saints Row 2 doesn't suck.
2577811	2585278	And, apparently, they're saying, you know, of course, marketing issues and product quality is the reasons for the... Uh-oh.
2586699	2587500	Product quality?
2588120	2590602	Well, it's just making sure that the game's not so glitchy.
2591814	2595437	After all, we don't want another musical detailing the glitches in the game.
2596317	2598279	Well, I do, but no one else does.
2599239	2600460	I don't know.
2600780	2605804	I think it's kind of cool that they're putting it out so late because that gives me enough time to be done with Grand Theft Auto 4.
2605984	2610627	Not that I'll ever be done with Grand Theft Auto 4, but to the point where I can play another game.
2612288	2612628	All right.
2613171	2613851	Play games I already have.
2636604	2642049	Rugu is coming out from South Peak and it's a puzzle game coming out for 800 Microsoft points.
2642069	2642249	That's $10.
2642429	2645332	And apparently it's a four-player game.
2645352	2646033	It doesn't have to be.
2646333	2652559	But what you do, you slide pegs of different shapes into appropriate holes while you're trying to save an alien race.
2653120	2656543	So it sounds like the game Perfection, but a little different.
2657011	2658131	That sounds bizarro.
2678398	2706933	and it's also an 800 point price tag and it's coming out from Artec and we have a screenshot so it looks like a space game hence Galaxy but that's about it so you'll have to check that out when the demo comes out but if you've been for whatever reason secretly following Aces of the Galaxy and no more information than we do well then the payoff is this week there you have it payoff hey hmm hey hey listen what
2709317	2709818	Galaga!
2710118	2712159	Yes.
2712439	2719124	There is a listing up for Galaga Legions for Xbox 360.
2719565	2730093	It's actually put up by the USK, which is the German version of the ESRB, and I would so try to pronounce it if I didn't suck completely at German, so whatever.
2730653	2733936	Although, actually, that did remind me of something funny I found in GTA 4, by the way.
2735176	2736057	But I'll talk about that later.
2736938	2737198	All righty.
2738672	2744277	Okay, they have a billboard for something called Passwasser.
2744657	2745158	Pisswater.
2745778	2746319	So, anyway.
2746939	2747520	I thought it was funny.
2748080	2748321	Okay.
2749402	2752104	So, basically, it's a shooter.
2752504	2754806	That's about all we know.
2755307	2756668	So, but it's Galaga.
2757689	2758610	And they're not sprightly.
2759150	2760151	You know, and pixely.
2760912	2761012	So...
2763563	2787298	you know what though the weird thing about this is that it makes me think maybe it's an upgrade thing like pac-man versus was or not versus pac-man well i mean that was an upgrade but you know i'm thinking a pac-man championship edition kind of like that although pac-man championship edition is pretty awesome so if they are making a game like that but out of galaga that could be kind of cool because i actually like galaga so i don't know
2787833	2789155	I like Galaga a whole lot.
2789696	2795184	I actually have a little charm thing that's the ship somewhere.
2798169	2801374	I don't know if I care for Galaga that much, but I don't know.
2801894	2805376	PENNY ARCADE was the highest grossing Xbox Live Arcade debut ever, earning $330,000 in its first three days.
2805396	2808198	The prior record holder was Worms HD.
2826629	2834016	and I guess in term of units sold on the Rainslake Precipice of Darkness was the third highest performer of 2008.
2834076	2837760	So that's pretty cool.
2838000	2838200	Huh.
2839081	2839962	Well, good for them.
2840162	2843485	I still have not bought the game, but I think I'm going to because I had a lot of fun with the demo.
2843805	2844366	So we'll see.
2845227	2846608	But the Penny Arcade game, good for them.
2848349	2849070	It's a funny game.
2849330	2849791	I know that.
2850643	2851925	Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars
2869306	2872450	is apparently making its way to Japan.
2873251	2874613	It's going to be in June.
2874673	2876996	It's made its way to the June release calendar.
2877616	2884285	And you know, games that tend to show up in the Japanese calendar usually end up over here eventually.
2885054	2886315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2903503	2925628	which we already have here, Neketsu, Coco, Dodgeball, Boo, for the Sega Master System, Rambo, for the Genesis, Phantasy Star 4, for PC Engine, which over here was TurboGrafx-16, Power Tennis, Days of Thunder, Paranoia, and Blazing Lasers, and for the Neo Geo, King of Monsters, Ninja Commando, and Art of Fighting 2.
2927269	2928369	Do you know the Art of Fighting?
2929825	2931726	I know there's a character named after me in Art of Fighting.
2931866	2951155	No, I spent about 30 minutes today reading the Wikipedia article about Dan from the Street Fighter Alpha series and how he's a big parody of Rio and Robert Garcia with Yuri's taunts.
2952516	2953016	Interesting.
2953991	2958633	But I don't know, are you excited about Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console, Loki?
2958813	2959934	I am pretty excited about it.
2962095	2963436	Just have to wait for it to come out over here.
2964076	2965237	We'll be waiting, Nintendo.
2965457	2966377	We're sitting here waiting.
2967538	2967878	I'm not.
2968978	2969258	Fine.
2969679	2971059	Then why don't you read a story or something?
2971239	2972420	I think I will then.
2973160	2976082	Guess what else is going to be on the Wii?
2977297	3000098	The Beer Pong Game No, you have to guess though because I'm not going to read the story Well, I know the answer Tecmo Bowl Not the virtual console releases we've already got but we'll have Tecmo Bowl Kickoff which is a new football game that is going to be on the Wii so it's going to be on the Wii and we'll probably use a Wiimote
3001224	3016294	And it's football, that's about all that we've got details on But I'm sort of agreeing with this article that it has the stench of WiiWare about it Will it have the awesome halftime cutscenes that the NES version had?
3017175	3025861	That's what I'm hoping for I believe it's going to be on Wii and be about football Should cover about everything I know about that game Fine
3027523	3027983	Be that way.
3028063	3028643	See if I care.
3028943	3029383	I will.
3029783	3031824	Hey, our Skype line is going to be open very soon.
3031844	3035064	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to get in on the fun.
3035764	3037545	We have a couple more stories to read for you first.
3037645	3037945	Loki.
3039105	3041345	I was going to say also one thing too.
3042526	3045246	Going back to the Tecmo Bowl, it's interesting this here.
3045626	3052207	You can customize your teams, everything down to the logos, to the player stats, names, etc.
3052747	3055288	That's how they're getting around not having the license.
3056340	3057660	because you can make your own teams.
3057881	3059461	Nice.
3059841	3060241	Smart.
3061382	3070785	Anyways, something else that's coming to consoles, well, not anytime soon, but eventually, Street Fighter 4.
3071086	3078428	And one of the cool things about Street Fighter 4 is other than online play, you'll be getting some new characters from the arcade.
3079729	3084931	And two of the characters that they showed concept art for, Fei Long and Dan.
3085651	3085751	Oh.
3087122	3088124	So that's pretty cool.
3088544	3096356	And there's also supposedly more characters beyond just those two, but two's a start.
3097588	3126480	and it's kind of interesting to see that they're adding characters from you know Street Fighter Turbo and stuff like that plus it's Dan and I'm sure that makes Jamie kind of happy yeah it's just because he cracks me up because I love that his one of his attacks is it translates to taunting legend and um uh shiny fist I love all of his attacks they're just hilarious I actually kind of like playing as Fei Long in the Street Fighter super game so I'm excited to hear he's in Street Fighter 4
3128639	3129299	Sound he always made.
3129620	3130400	That's pretty cool.
3132681	3133181	There you go.
3134082	3137844	All right, we'll be checking that out when Street Fighter 4 comes out here in America.
3138644	3140185	Hopefully sooner rather than later.
3140245	3140645	We'll see.
3141405	3143406	Anyhow, Steam.
3143486	3147909	I talked about Steam earlier when I was talking about AudioSurf, which I was reviewing earlier in the show.
3148569	3151891	Valve has announced that there will be a new edition coming to Steam.
3151991	3152671	It's Steam Clash.
3152671	3153211	Cloud.
3153731	3155552	It's a service that was announced this past week.
3155572	3168256	What it's going to do, it's going to store your Steam player data online and the cool thing about that is that you can access your saved games, keyboard configurations, all the games that you purchased through Steam from any computer anywhere.
3169056	3172138	So that was something that was announced earlier this week.
3172939	3181485	Valve is very committed to PC gaming and saying that PC retail is not doomed, even though they sometimes have these free weekend games on Steam.
3182186	3184627	It just in turn supports stronger sales at retail.
3184647	3186569	You know, some people just don't want to buy their games online.
3187750	3189471	So we'll have to see how this turns out.
3189511	3191112	It sounds pretty cool in theory, doesn't it?
3191973	3192173	Yeah.
3192593	3193614	So we'll see how that works.
3193634	3194274	Yeah, in theory.
3194815	3196296	You never know how that's going to work.
3196787	3198569	Alright, the Skype line is now open.
3198589	3200410	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3200510	3202912	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3203412	3205554	And we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take a call.
3205614	3206715	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3206755	3207115	Who's this?
3208377	3209918	Hey, it's GS68.
3210038	3210678	Huzzah!
3211039	3211779	Hello, Huzzah.
3211819	3212480	What's on your mind, buddy?
3214682	3215722	So, California Extreme.
3216703	3218585	I think I'm going to go check it out.
3220148	3227753	Cool, then we'll see you there, and hopefully we'll be able to do something there, although I don't know if it's last minute or what, but we'll do an OLR lunch or something, if nothing else.
3228274	3233557	If I decide to go, that might throw me what little chance I have of going to Comic-Con this year.
3234158	3236399	Oh, decisions, decisions.
3236459	3237920	Comic-Con I hear is pretty awesome.
3237960	3239702	I've never been myself, but...
3250242	3250742	Here's the thing.
3250782	3253623	If we go to California Extreme, we're probably only going to go for the day.
3253683	3257964	I don't know about Jamie, but I see it as more of a day trip than a weekend trip, personally.
3258225	3259645	I don't think it's something I want to stay the night for.
3259665	3260885	I think I'm actually going to go for both days.
3261085	3261366	Wow.
3262086	3262686	She's dedicated.
3263686	3264967	Mainly because I'm in the area.
3265327	3266767	Well, Santa Clara specifically.
3267327	3267508	Right.
3267968	3269788	Oh, gosh, it's right in your backyard.
3269868	3270248	Why not?
3270308	3270769	You should go.
3271549	3272129	Pretty much.
3272149	3274970	It's like six miles from my house.
3275692	3277595	Oh, well then you got nothing, you got nothing to worry about.
3277615	3280478	Speaking of Santa Clara, you said you live in Santa Clara?
3280498	3281259	Yep.
3281719	3284323	I, uh, I might be going to Santa Clara around the time of my birthday.
3284363	3290089	I'm thinking of taking the day off work to go with, uh, my, uh, boyfriend and we can go ride some rides, so it'll be fun.
3290690	3293193	Thank you very much.
3293213	3294715	Uh, I've only been there once.
3295253	3297014	What critical thing you learned out of my Fanime report last week?
3297034	3297235	Swap meet.
3297255	3298155	Oh, how was the swap meet at Fanime?
3323581	3324702	Best deals ever.
3325242	3325622	How so?
3326562	3331385	Like, if you go to Kingdom Kingdom, for example, and buy a year beat CD, it's like $40.
3331465	3335607	Like, this guy over at the swap meet was selling those for only $10 each.
3336407	3337008	Nice.
3337728	3340449	Now to get some other games that are cheap, Contra 4 for $18 and Amplitude for $3.
3340489	3340549	Huh.
3344389	3345230	I like bargains.
3345291	3348796	That's one thing I missed about going down to... I almost called it out of my expo.
3349096	3359573	One thing I missed about going to Faname this year was getting to go to the dealer's room and the swap meet and all that good stuff and trying to get some good deals on shirts and stuffed animals and other chibi things.
3361004	3363645	I did something cool happen when I was like getting Contra 4.
3363705	3374827	I had a $100 bill and I offered to get only $80 and change back and to make it for a difference, you throw in an Ultramix 3 slash Extreme 2 sample CD.
3375667	3376007	Oh, hey.
3376947	3379628	Well, little deals are pretty awesome sometimes.
3380088	3380988	So, cool, cool.
3381088	3386189	Yeah, so to anyone listening, if you go to Anime Convention and don't go to swap meets, you're missing out.
3386669	3387389	Swap meets are great.
3387429	3389150	I've looked into lots of good stuff at swap meets.
3389890	3390170	Awesome.
3391252	3398493	Alright, well, GS6TO, we've got to let you go take some more calls, but it sounds like we'll be running into you at some Bay Area event in the near future, so take care, buddy.
3400634	3403134	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3403214	3405094	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3405134	3406075	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3406095	3406435	Who's this?
3407275	3407955	Hey, what's up, guys?
3408015	3408415	It's Toshin.
3408635	3409455	Hello, Toshin.
3409475	3410335	What's on your mind, my friend?
3411616	3412056	Not much.
3413096	3416956	I wanted to know, Rob, if you've got picked up Super Dodgeball for the DS this week.
3417637	3418777	No, I forgot it came out.
3418837	3419357	Did you get it?
3420222	3423184	Yeah, I actually played my friend's copy and he loaned it to me.
3423224	3423885	It's pretty fun.
3424165	3424645	Oh my god.
3424825	3425706	Tell us about this game.
3426046	3427547	Is it faithful to the original or what?
3428247	3429548	I would say it's pretty faithful.
3430549	3440476	I only got to play a multiplayer brawl, but you can apparently level up your players and there's like 14 or 15 different teams you can pick.
3441497	3447060	And your super shots are apparently picked on your birth date that you enter whenever they ask you for it.
3447461	3447901	Huh.
3448281	3449082	That's kind of interesting.
3449722	3455627	Yeah, so I don't know all the combinations of like the super shots, but my friend's is pretty cool.
3455647	3462092	It's kind of like the one where, you know, when you run and it was like one of the slider ones that goes back and forth like a vertical ball.
3462393	3462633	Right.
3463734	3465455	He had that one set up, which was kind of cool.
3465715	3466056	Huh.
3466196	3466516	I didn't get it.
3467807	3468987	8-Man Brawl 8-Man Brawl
3497242	3497882	All right.
3498703	3499043	Very cool.
3499203	3500584	Anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?
3500624	3501925	Any other games you've been playing or what have you?
3503606	3511730	I haven't been playing a lot because I've been working a lot, but I probably won't make use of the 600 or 800 Microsoft points you're going to give me.
3513011	3515852	Yes, I finally got that over to you, so definitely check that out.
3515872	3517473	Well, you're supposed to be getting ResHD with it.
3517493	3519074	That was the deal, so check that out.
3521619	3523140	Oh no, I'll make use of the points.
3523320	3527741	I will definitely make use of the points and me and you are going to have to play like Rock Band or something soon or something.
3527941	3530802	Alright, well I want full reviews on whatever you get later on, okay?
3531442	3531802	You got it.
3532022	3533383	Alright, take care Toshin, have a good one.
3533963	3534383	Yep, thanks.
3535003	3535423	Thank you.
3535563	3539444	Thanks for the reminder about that DS, Super Dodgeball DS.
3539484	3540445	I had no idea it was coming out.
3540505	3541805	Hey, the phone's ringing off the hook tonight.
3541845	3542885	We're already into another call.
3542945	3543946	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3543966	3544326	Who's this?
3545606	3548667	Yo, this is Jammer J. Hello, Jammer J. What's on your mind?
3548707	3550008	I don't believe I've heard you call before.
3550028	3550688	Have you called before?
3551465	3552466	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3574986	3577369	Just to solely play an arcade version of DDR.
3577729	3578870	Ooh, good question.
3578970	3583094	Farthest we've ever traveled to solely play an arcade version of DDR.
3583154	3585096	Loki, do you have any answer for this?
3585136	3586838	Well, it's pretty much just like three hours, I think.
3586918	3593805	We drove from here to San Jose or Milpitas to play some Japanese stuff there.
3593825	3596328	I remember also we drove to Stockton Golf Land to play...
3597549	3599110	Extreme, I think.
3599210	3600491	It was Max 2 when it first came out.
3600511	3601571	Yeah, Max 2 when it first came out.
3601591	3602912	They only had it stocked in Golf Land.
3603672	3604312	Well, here's the thing.
3604593	3605853	Do tournaments count?
3605913	3610796	Because we drove all the way to San Diego once to go to a tournament at Raze, and San Diego's like a 10-hour drive from here.
3611966	3614807	So that was pretty, that's like one of the farthest I can think of.
3615028	3618850	Or if you guys drove to like, was it the Japanese arcades?
3619110	3619850	Arcade Infinity.
3619870	3630615	I was thinking, I didn't drive all this way to play DDR, but I have driven that whole way to play Beatmania 2DX would be Arcade Infinity, which is in LA, which is about a six and a half hour drive from here.
3631256	3632356	So how about you?
3632817	3633857	What's the furthest you've ever driven?
3633877	3640060	I think about six hours, but sometimes when I go on trips, I make it a highlight to hit up any DDR in the area.
3640120	3640981	So I think...
3641621	3642201	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3664090	3665251	DDR tournament in Biloxi when I went back to visit
3691725	3696184	I know you were out for a moment when the caller first called in, but he was wondering what's the furthest you've ever gone just to play DDR?
3696773	3697713	Just to play DDR?
3697793	3697993	Yeah.
3698954	3702495	And I was saying, okay, Beatmania 2DX at least.
3702535	3704355	There's been Arcade Infinity, but that's a close thing.
3704375	3706516	Actually, I went to San Diego.
3708716	3710197	I was going to San Diego anyway.
3710817	3717719	But one of the things I intended on doing was playing the DDR Max when it was new.
3717899	3721540	That's right, because Raise was like the first place anywhere that had that, huh?
3721580	3722320	And I went and played it.
3723100	3732045	and that's when I realized that the hold arrows hurt really bad because I've got a little bit of a weakness in my ankles.
3732966	3739949	Other than that, the farthest distance I've traveled and then played DDR was going back to Alabama from here.
3740090	3741210	Okay, that's cool.
3741230	3743131	Was that Biloxi tournament at Boomtown?
3743892	3745292	I do believe it was.
3745452	3746633	It was a few years ago.
3746733	3748154	It was definitely before Katrina.
3748734	3751736	And it was when we had a max, they were just getting a fifth mix.
3754625	3758288	Okay, yeah, I think I remember that, because my buddy was working at that arcade there in Boomtown.
3758588	3758808	Wow.
3758868	3760630	It wasn't Boomtown, now that I think about it.
3760650	3760970	Small world.
3760990	3764813	Because it was that, the arcade was sort of off to the side, if I remember correctly.
3765333	3765634	Yeah.
3765834	3767835	And it was a shiny, brand new machine.
3768316	3771398	And I got up there, and I think I played, when did I play Superstar?
3772879	3779484	Because that was, no, it wasn't that, it was when I was, I had this thing about doing, what was it that I used to always play in Hidden?
3779504	3779665	Yeah.
3781847	3784269	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3804166	3808192	but there's a within two hours is Supernova 2 arcade so that's not too bad.
3808292	3808813	That's sweet.
3809014	3812159	Apparently there's a Supernova 2 in Roseville but I have yet to play it.
3813000	3817067	I love being from the south but I don't miss living there.
3819005	3819305	DarkSakura.com
3838956	3845818	I don't know the reason I don't play the home version so much is up here I don't have a good, since I live in an apartment complex, I can't use my Cobalt Flux.
3846218	3849538	It depends on what you play at home on the actual platforms.
3849858	3856540	I had that problem when I lived with Extifer is that we lived upstairs and when I played DDR it wasn't fun for the downstairs people so I couldn't do that.
3859040	3865962	Yeah, but other than that, some people in the home version they have just as much fun on it but I would need to really play in the arcade because I hit pretty hard on the pads.
3866222	3866382	Huh.
3868301	3873884	Alright, well Jammer J, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, so thanks for the call, and I hope we call you in again sometime, we like hearing from new folks.
3873964	3875786	Peace out, and triple A. Peace out.
3876726	3877147	Peace out!
3877447	3877707	Alright.
3879008	3879908	What was the other thing you said?
3880269	3881049	Triple A?
3881149	3881750	Like car insurance?
3881770	3882590	Yeah, I guess so.
3882730	3884472	Or maybe, you know, high score?
3884872	3885793	DDR, triple A?
3887998	3889878	Where you make the machine go, oh!
3890619	3891679	One more call.
3891739	3892759	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3892779	3893119	Who's this?
3894019	3895140	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
3895200	3896380	God, you always get through.
3896400	3897960	You got the miracle dialing finger.
3898000	3898460	That's all right.
3898480	3899220	We like you, at least.
3899280	3899761	What's on your mind?
3900761	3901381	Not too much.
3901421	3904261	I'm recovering from Wizard World Philly, which was this weekend.
3904782	3905242	From what?
3905662	3906182	Wizard World.
3906222	3907322	Wizard World Philly.
3907822	3908322	How is that?
3910403	3911143	Want me to be honest?
3911723	3912343	Yes, of course.
3913263	3913864	It sucked.
3914864	3915484	Why did it suck?
3917463	3924946	As much as they really said this would be a big comic book convention, I could tell you it looked like no more than 10,000 people showed up at least.
3925146	3927147	It was just quiet.
3927207	3928388	It was just like bleh.
3928628	3929888	I don't know.
3929908	3930769	10,000 sounds like a lot to me.
3930809	3932589	I mean, there's no Comic Con, but still.
3934290	3937311	Plus, the tournaments were kind of crappy too.
3938052	3938612	That's too bad.
3940626	3948795	Another thing that really pissed me off was the fact that somebody was there selling ROMs and emulators and ROMs for between $30 and $50.
3949275	3952238	Oh, you can get really busted for that.
3952298	3957844	I mean it's kind of illegal to begin with, but when you're selling it for profit, that's when they really go all out of the way to get you.
3958285	3958925	You got to be careful.
3959646	3960026	Turn them in.
3960046	3962209	The funny thing is with – I said turn them in.
3963598	3963978	Hmm.
3964198	3964258	Hmm.
3991025	3992366	Alright, well, interesting.
3993387	3994488	Tell me a little more about this con.
3994508	3998351	It was comics and games and anime and all of that all rolled into one?
3999292	3999532	Some of it.
3999552	4003935	There's more comic books than they add in a touch of science fiction and anime.
4004796	4005797	Kind of like Comic Con.
4006357	4007518	Because that's what Comic Con does.
4007558	4014384	I mean, Comic Con is supposed to be about comic books, but hello, the Battlestar Galactica people show up every year and it's turned into this big, big thing, so...
4015641	4018803	Even with Starbuck being there, it still wasn't that big, big, big thing.
4019243	4020104	Aw, too bad.
4020184	4020864	Starbuck was there?
4021645	4024326	Yeah, my roommate was online for two hours to get her autograph.
4024546	4024807	Nice.
4026508	4026868	Good times.
4026928	4029429	I've finally been catching up on Battlestar Galactica.
4029449	4031430	I'm in the third season right now, so good times.
4032731	4034792	Yeah, overall, I don't think we're going back next year.
4035313	4035953	Aw, that's too bad.
4036493	4037254	Well, there you go.
4038475	4040576	All right, well, Ranma, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4041701	4042281	Quick story.
4042541	4042802	Alright.
4043062	4045663	About two weeks ago, I went to GameStop to pick up a game.
4045723	4047224	I bought Rumble Roses XX.
4047244	4049285	Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but I wanted the game.
4049305	4049805	I want that game.
4049845	4050226	Sucker.
4050606	4051246	I want that game.
4052907	4053668	Hey, I paid $12.99 for it.
4053688	4054168	Can't complain.
4054528	4055128	No, no.
4055929	4056969	Actually, I do want that game.
4058050	4058650	Like, quite a lot.
4059651	4060371	Good music, right?
4061192	4061512	Yeah.
4061672	4062032	Boobs.
4064353	4066515	Alright, finish your story, Ranma.
4067715	4068876	We gotta finish sometime tonight.
4069750	4070490	Sure, no problem.
4070690	4077632	So as I'm picking up the game, there's a guy there who flat out says, turn-based RPGs suck.
4078352	4080132	And I looked at him, I'm like, what was that?
4080192	4081993	He's like, yeah, turn-based RPGs suck.
4082073	4088354	And me and my roommate look at him, and I'm like, you've never played the classic games like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy?
4088714	4091655	He looks at me and my roommate and goes, oh, you guys must be in your 30s or your 40s.
4096488	4098830	I would have slapped him right there in the store if I could.
4099010	4100051	Bastard, you should have.
4100652	4101632	Teach the kid a lesson.
4102553	4104775	Respect your elders, you little shit.
4106256	4108779	Well, my roommate goes, yeah, you're right.
4109099	4110040	You're absolutely correct.
4110160	4114764	Tell you what, I'm going to go home and have sex with my hot Asian girlfriend while you're fat with your five fingers.
4114984	4115244	Later.
4121029	4121550	Oh, snap.
4123622	4153147	and Alina if you looked a little bit like Rossio UT oh stop it I'm sorry I had to get that in just for the chat room I'm so glad that you're coming to hang out with me Ranma what's the weekend you're going to be here 4th of July weekend I'll be touching down in Sacramento at 11.06am so you're just going to miss the anniversary show well I can't get that time off no it's fine better late than never right
4153962	4182547	of course, we'll make up for it for lots of alcohol look, we're gonna have a great Independence Day Ranma, think of it this way fire explosions at my house exactly dude, okay, we pull a couch out in front of the street and burn shit that's the best and then at the end they burn the couch firecrackers at broken toilets, okay I don't know where they find it every day, they find a toilet, they get the firecrackers they just start launching them out of there I'm like, where the hell do you find this?
4182887	4183247	you don't know
4183683	4186446	BlackWolf in chat sums it up perfectly.
4186486	4187628	Our old buddy Bobby BlackWolf.
4187888	4191753	The 4th of July, the day where you celebrate the birth of our nation by blowing a part of it up.
4193195	4194036	Works for me.
4194396	4195577	All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.
4195938	4196639	Take care, buddy.
4196679	4198020	See you soon.
4198441	4199923	Bring fire.
4199983	4201304	Actually, don't bring fire on the plane.
4201324	4201805	They don't like that.
4201845	4202826	I like fire.
4204738	4205519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4220379	4220819	Oh, fun.
4221320	4222741	I mean, I didn't mind doing it, but still.
4223782	4225663	Rob was in a really bad way last year.
4225683	4227324	Yeah, it was bad.
4227424	4229746	Anyway, let's not talk about my crappy life.
4229806	4231888	Let's talk about last-minute stories.
4232048	4233449	Loki, do you have anything tonight for us?
4233649	4234830	Yeah.
4234970	4249141	Nintendo actually had released some dates for Japanese game releases, and there's some new games on there that a lot of people might not know about, including, well, this one they showed off before, Mario Super Sluggers for the Wii, which is coming out June 19th there.
4251003	4255069	Band Brothers DX Resident Evil Zero Wario Land Shake Wario Land Shake
4267546	4273630	Super Paper Mario Type Game July 31st, Fatal Frame 4, The Mask of the Lunar Eclipse Rhythm Tengoku Gold
4285536	4291862	another rhythm music game, and Fire Emblem DS on August 7th.
4292643	4299909	And they have a screenshot, or not really, well, a scan, I guess, of some of the stuff for Wario Land Shake.
4299929	4300650	It looks pretty cool.
4300950	4302632	It's just like a platforming game and stuff.
4304884	4305565	Let's see here.
4305726	4312414	Also, there's a new tournament going on for Mario Kart Wii.
4312735	4313656	This one's a little different.
4313676	4315919	It's not just like a race and times and stuff like that.
4315939	4319584	You're actually doing a boss battle and you're battling...
4320845	4348475	the spiky top man from Super Mario Galaxy so that's kind of neat that they actually have almost kind of like download content for this game that you're fighting a new boss or something I don't know why they include something like this in the game like maybe a story mode or something like that but at the very least though you can check it out for free and the exclusive tournament and content ends June 9th so if you want to check that out
4349366	4351007	Do it now.
4352048	4352709	Let's see here.
4353450	4358354	Apparently, there's that game next week, Grid, that's coming out.
4358654	4362097	The Xbox 360 version is apparently freezing up on people.
4362838	4363298	Uh-oh.
4363318	4364799	Uh-oh.
4366000	4371505	Codemasters is rushing to fix the game already, which I believe has been released in the UK already.
4371986	4376269	But it will be coming out soon, maybe a day one patch or something like that.
4378564	4389551	They say we're getting close through the problem and we will be including a fix and a backup workaround option just in case in our forthcoming patch due within the next few weeks or sooner.
4390252	4398197	We think the issue is due to a specific drive hardware and possibly with bad blocks or sectors on your hard drive.
4399858	4400719	Interesting.
4402820	4403481	Let's see here.
4403501	4408464	Apparently Nintendo of America has 100 WiiWare titles in development.
4409790	4416645	I wonder how many of those are going to be crap So that's interesting And let's see here
4418117	4420139	There's some mobile games that have been selling pretty well.
4420939	4426944	Sonic Mobile has hit 8 million downloads, which is pretty amazing for a mobile game.
4427084	4431207	And Guitar Hero 3 Mobile has made 1 million downloads.
4431748	4432468	So that's kind of cool.
4433890	4442597	If you're interested in watching some original content from G4, or stuff that they used to have on their station, you can check out both...
4443584	4462751	I think they have episodes of X-Play on there now, or Attack of the Show and stuff like that, as well as Code Monkeys, and I want to say there was a Block, I guess, which is a snowboard documentary series that never really debuted on the network.
4464351	4464531	Huh.
4464551	4470393	Why don't they just put this stuff on their own network instead of, I don't know, cops, marathons, and cheaters?
4470934	4471834	It's beyond me, but...
4473134	4474694	DarkSakura I like fire
