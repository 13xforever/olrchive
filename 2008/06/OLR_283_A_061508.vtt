00:00.000 --> 00:18.640
Today, June 15th, 2008, does Nintendo think you are a geek?

00:18.640 --> 00:20.720
How can you get your picture in Street Fighter 4?

00:20.720 --> 00:29.760
And many new role-playing games get dated for the Xbox 360.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.480
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.480 --> 00:36.480
Radio.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.640
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:40.640 --> 00:41.800
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.520
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.480
Joining us a little late tonight is the one and only dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.240
She's not here yet, but she's en route, so we'll connect with her when she gets here

00:51.240 --> 00:52.320
to studio.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.360
But already here and ready to go, the one and only tech master, Loki.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
Hello.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
How you doing, Loki?

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
I'm doing fine.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
All right.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.760
Gosh, I guess there's not a lot to say.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.560
We don't have a lot of special guests tonight.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.920
It's kind of a slow night.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.840
It was kind of a slow news week up until about two hours ago, which we'll get into in a little

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
bit.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.440
And we're just kind of sitting here waiting for next week, our sixth anniversary show.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.040
We've had some changes in studio.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.040
I don't know if you can see it on Justin TV.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.680
A lot of people are bitching on Justin TV because it's kind of blurry tonight because

01:21.680 --> 01:25.360
we just don't have the bandwidth right now to put out a really clear image and the way

01:25.360 --> 01:31.680
we have things hooked up as a crappy revolution, not revolution, yeah, JTV revolution, TV,

01:31.680 --> 01:32.680
TV revolution.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.200
I don't know, but it looks like complete crap, but hopefully you can make out that Loki finally

01:37.200 --> 01:38.920
has a real chair.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.280
It's this nice blue little fluffy chair thing going on.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.120
It's the chair that Jamie used to have.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.520
She has a couch now.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.360
Yes, because now there is a couch over there.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.920
Maybe I can show the people on Justin TV about the couch.

01:50.920 --> 01:51.920
I don't know.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.440
Maybe if you untangle yourself from the chair there.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
There.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.440
Can they see that?

01:58.440 --> 01:59.640
Yeah, they can see that.

01:59.640 --> 02:00.640
It's a couch.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.760
That's the couch.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.660
Now I have to fix the camera, so we better start off tonight's show with a little bit

02:05.660 --> 02:08.200
of how was your gaming week, Loki?

02:08.200 --> 02:10.320
I didn't play a whole lot this week.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.280
I meant to, but I just got distracted.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.440
I'm 100% complete now with Grand Theft Auto IV, so I've got the achievement and all that

02:19.440 --> 02:20.440
fun stuff.

02:20.440 --> 02:28.080
Now, I finally got my video set up at home working, so I'm recording video now of game

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
playing.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.960
I can do direct feed stuff now, which is cool.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.200
I tried all these different ways to get my video capture thing to work right, and really

02:36.200 --> 02:40.020
the only thing that ended up is I needed to bring back my TV, which you may remember was

02:40.020 --> 02:44.840
in the old arcade cabinet, back from work and put it into the computer room.

02:44.840 --> 02:50.320
So now I have a TV sitting on the floor there that I play video on, and it has a video out

02:50.320 --> 02:57.940
on the TV, and that goes straight to the capture card, and it looks pretty, and it works awesome.

02:57.940 --> 03:04.920
So what I've been doing, because I got bored on Friday and I was watching some GameTrailers.com

03:04.920 --> 03:09.640
videos from Grand Theft Auto IV, and some of the glitch stuff that's in there, and one

03:09.640 --> 03:13.920
of the new glitches that someone found is the evil swing set, and what the evil swing

03:13.920 --> 03:19.760
set does is if you drive your car up to that evil swing set and leave it there for a second,

03:19.760 --> 03:25.240
it will fling you way into the air, and it's hilarious.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.360
So I was playing around with that most of the weekend, and recording video, and now

03:29.360 --> 03:35.620
I've edited it down, and I'm trying to put something together coherent with it, and hopefully

03:35.620 --> 03:37.960
we'll see a lot more of these things.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.400
So we might actually have something on our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.400
Yes.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.980
Because we haven't had anything on there in like two years.

03:43.980 --> 03:47.800
I think the last thing that's on there is when you and Jamie were interviewed by the

03:47.800 --> 03:50.580
news station about Guitar Hero 1.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.580
That's pretty old.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.100
That's the last thing that's on there.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.920
So good, I'm glad to hear we have some updates.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
That's awesome.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.400
And I got a video camera too, so I'm hoping I can do some stuff as well, especially with

04:00.400 --> 04:03.760
Penny Arcade Expo around the corner, which I still need to book my flight for, I've been

04:03.760 --> 04:05.880
a very bad boy, but I do plan on going.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
So it'll be fun.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.760
And Blizzcon, Blizzcon's definite as well.

04:08.760 --> 04:15.700
I did pick up Blastworks this week, and I actually meant to do stuff with it, but Nelly

04:15.700 --> 04:18.460
was playing Speed Racer a lot this week.

04:18.460 --> 04:20.960
She really has found a game she loves, huh?

04:20.960 --> 04:25.320
No, she's already bored of it, because she's gotten to a part now where it's so hard that

04:25.320 --> 04:32.320
she can't go any further, so she's like kind of given up on it and going back to reading.

04:32.320 --> 04:37.160
But no, I actually have Blastworks, and I meant to do some really cool stuff with it,

04:37.160 --> 04:40.840
but I haven't quite gotten everything that I need.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.720
My setup and everything's all ready to go.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.120
I just need to, I don't know, actually sit down and do it.

04:47.120 --> 04:52.240
Basically, I want to put the Star Fox ships in Blastworks, because it makes sense.

04:52.240 --> 04:56.320
Star Fox, very simple looking, and you could probably recreate it pretty simple.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.180
So I'll make some levels out of that, that'd be fun.

05:00.180 --> 05:05.020
But yeah, we already have a thread going on our forums, and people are exchanging stuff.

05:05.020 --> 05:08.160
There's been some pretty cool stuff already made, like an OLR sign, and the...

05:08.160 --> 05:09.160
I haven't seen that.

05:09.160 --> 05:14.160
I saw the Phoenix Wright one, not Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, I saw the Apollo Justice

05:14.160 --> 05:15.160
thing.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.160
Yeah, you gotta check it out.

05:16.160 --> 05:24.040
They have an OLR sign, and there is some other stuff on there too, that's pretty funny.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.640
So definitely worth checking out.

05:25.640 --> 05:30.480
Yeah, if you want to see that, just head on to our very archaic website at orangeloungeradio.com.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.440
We were gonna get a new website, we really need to look into that.

05:34.440 --> 05:40.800
And go to our forums, and you're gonna click on the OLR me clans, and you go to the Blastworks

05:40.800 --> 05:48.520
custom data thread, and let's see, there's the Apollo Justice, oh look at that, that's

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
cute.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.800
The OLR billboard made by GS68, that's pretty rad.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.360
And then some more ships there that he made.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.800
I like that.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.800
That's cool.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.840
Yeah, that's one thing I think this game's gonna catch a lot of people by surprise, because

06:00.840 --> 06:04.000
there's so much you can make with it, and there's that online community where you can

06:04.000 --> 06:06.360
share stuff, download other things.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.160
So once you get done playing the game and unlocking the four other games in it, I mean

06:10.160 --> 06:15.680
you can practically play all new games, you know, forever.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.320
So it's pretty awesome.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.320
Wow, sounds pretty good.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.600
Alright, well as far as my gaming week goes, let me see, what kind of stuff have I been

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
playing in my gaming week?

06:25.600 --> 06:29.360
Not a whole lot, because you know, there was World of Warcraft, and we went through all

06:29.360 --> 06:33.080
of Karazhan in one night, because you know, we're addicted, and Irene called me, and she

06:33.080 --> 06:35.160
was like, Rob, Karazhan.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.160
So there was that.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.160
But I have been playing other games.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.640
I checked out the demo for Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.760
This is a game I've been pretty excited about, because if you've listened to this show before,

06:43.760 --> 06:48.160
you know I love old school Civilization, like the very first one that was on the PCs back

06:48.160 --> 06:49.400
in the early 90s.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.400
I love this game to bits, even as much as most console games.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.540
I mean, it's probably my favorite PC game of all time, certainly.

06:57.540 --> 07:01.720
So I wanted to see how it translated to console, and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed.

07:01.720 --> 07:07.840
I think they took out a lot of micromanaging that made Civilization really complicated.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.840
I mean, not to say it's bad, because playing Civilization Revolution, I also went back

07:12.840 --> 07:18.000
to go play Civilization 4, which I had skipped, because I wasn't all that big on Civilization

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
3.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.720
I was like, ah, nothing's ever gonna live up to the original.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.960
I actually really enjoyed Civilization 4, even though there's more of that micromanaging,

07:24.960 --> 07:28.860
and you actually have to kind of manage your settlers and all that going on there.

07:28.860 --> 07:33.060
But in Civilization Revolution, they've really kind of, I think, I guess streamlined a lot

07:33.060 --> 07:39.040
of it to make it more accessible to a newbie, and made it just feel more like a casual gaming

07:39.040 --> 07:40.040
experience.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.080
I guess maybe that's what it is, it's more, but I feel weird calling Civilization a casual

07:44.080 --> 07:45.080
game, because it's really not.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.520
But they made it, I guess, a little easier, but I don't want to say they dumbed it down,

07:49.520 --> 07:51.720
because Civilization is a very smart game.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
You know what I mean?

07:52.720 --> 08:00.920
I was gonna say that I'm not really looking forward to Civilization, but Red Alert 3 is

08:00.920 --> 08:04.360
gonna be coming out later this year, and that might be something I have to look at.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.120
Is that something that's coming out on consoles?

08:06.120 --> 08:09.960
Yes, on the Xbox 360, and I think PC.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.640
So it'll be pretty awesome.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.640
Huge Red Alert fan, though.

08:14.640 --> 08:19.620
I don't know, though, I'm more of the PC Red Alert, because I like cheating my ass off

08:19.620 --> 08:24.680
in that game, especially playing with the rules.ini files and stuff like that, and adding

08:24.680 --> 08:28.520
the school bus of death, and fun stuff like that.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.520
Hmm.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.520
Alright.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.600
Let's see, other games I played this week, well I guess it was just the Civilization

08:34.600 --> 08:40.080
4, and then for some reason I had a night of Atari 2600 gaming, thanks to GameTap.

08:40.080 --> 08:45.920
I went back and played Kaboom, and went back and played Freeway, and all these crazy 2600

08:45.920 --> 08:49.080
games that I remember from the past.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.120
It was all good.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.120
And that was really it.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.120
Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.040
I don't even remember what came out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.520
Was this Commando this week?

08:57.520 --> 08:58.520
I think it was Commando.

08:58.520 --> 09:02.120
I think I wanted to check that out, but I just never got around to that.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.120
Alright.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.800
Alright, so Dark Sakura is settling in, she just got here.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.800
I hate people.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.520
Sorry, I hate people, too.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.700
I hate people to get in my way.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.040
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.400
Did you have a good gaming week?

09:16.400 --> 09:24.840
We bought Crystal Castles for the Atari 2600 today, and Dragon's something that's the Genesis

09:24.840 --> 09:26.480
equivalent of Devil's Crush.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.160
Oh, I don't even know this game.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.240
I forgot the name, I'm kind of...

09:32.240 --> 09:35.880
I'm sure a chatter will think of it, chat.orangetonstrategy.com if you want to join in the fun.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.780
And I finally found the one movie I've been looking for that, you know, I've been finding

09:39.780 --> 09:44.960
it expensive, even used, and I was pissed off, but I finally, finally found it for ten

09:44.960 --> 09:45.960
bucks.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
Yeah.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.960
Hypercube.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.960
Oh, okay.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.960
That's like Cube 3, right?

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
Cube 2.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.960
Huh.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.920
If you haven't seen it, you can come over and watch it with me, because it's the awesome

09:54.920 --> 09:55.920
one.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.440
I haven't seen Cube 2 or Cube 3, I've seen the original Cube.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.640
Cube would be a pretty badass video game, wouldn't it?

10:00.640 --> 10:03.760
I have to tell you, someone has made a Hypercube mod for Half-Life.

10:03.760 --> 10:04.760
Uh-huh.

10:04.760 --> 10:05.760
Interesting.

10:05.760 --> 10:13.160
I like Hypercube just because it has to do with weird physics.

10:13.160 --> 10:18.200
You know, stuff that Carl Sagan talked about.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.440
Gameguru in our chat at chat.orangetonstrategy.com says, Keystone Capers for the win.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.760
There's a lot of Atari 2600 left tonight.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.160
What possessed you to go get Crystal Castles for the 2600?

10:27.160 --> 10:32.920
We were at Dimple and it was there, and so we bought it.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.460
Well, alrighty.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.120
And I almost bought Season 5 of Bullshit.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.080
How far can you get in Crystal Castles?

10:39.080 --> 10:44.520
Like, I can only get to like the second set of boards, and like, I guess there's like

10:44.520 --> 10:49.040
10 sets of boards, and I'm like, oh my god, this game is massive, and I really suck at

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
it.

10:50.040 --> 10:57.120
Well, the best Crystal Castles player in the world, if you watch the King of Kong video,

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
he's in it.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.580
At least he was the last one who got the record on it.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.640
He plays it with his feet.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.960
Wow.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.680
Like with the trackball, with his feet?

11:05.680 --> 11:10.080
The arcade is sitting in a chair, using his feet.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.080
That's pretty rad.

11:11.080 --> 11:17.760
I have to say that is pretty, pretty amazing on a stupid computer.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.760
So we're always on the cutting edge of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio, playing Atari

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
2600 games this week.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.920
I've had plenty of edges of stuff.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.480
Usually paper cuts on the manuals.

11:27.480 --> 11:34.280
Oh yeah, we also had a good bit of Metal Gear Solid 4 being beaten twice over in my house.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.520
That's what the other one was, Frogger 2.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.360
Oh god.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.760
I think probably better left forgotten.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.760
I don't know.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
I don't know.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.760
The Frogger games weren't all bad.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.760
But I want to hear about, the hell with Frogger.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.560
I want to hear about Metal Gear Solid 4, because I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner.

11:46.560 --> 11:51.360
I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf live, because you know, he's on live before us over at AllGames.com,

11:51.360 --> 11:55.400
and one of his callers called in to just rave about the game.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.760
Dark Soccer, I know you've been a Solid Snake fan for a while.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.760
What do you think?

11:58.760 --> 11:59.880
It was pretty epic.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.880
Pretty epic.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.400
And Dan hurt his fingers playing.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.520
He actually got a cramp in his middle finger.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
Wow.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.800
I was like, my man, hardcore gamer.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.680
And I'm sure he's showing it off to everybody.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.680
Look what I hurt.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Look what I hurt.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
No.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.680
He's been talking about it though.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.880
I have to say though, it's got like the longest fucking ending in the universe.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.440
And it's also the biggest WTF ending in the universe, which I'm not going to say more

12:23.440 --> 12:24.440
than that.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
Right.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.440
But it has plenty of my man in it.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.440
Solid Snake?

12:27.440 --> 12:28.440
Because I'm like the only one that likes Raiden.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.900
Oh, Raiden.

12:29.900 --> 12:34.200
And on top of that, it's a lot of Raiden kicking ass until he doesn't kick ass.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.960
And that's not all I'm going to say about that.

12:38.960 --> 12:46.960
But I have to say that I'm overall pleased with the project and give Kojima and team

12:46.960 --> 12:51.040
mad props for doing a good job.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.820
I don't know if you can say this without spoiling, so you can say I can't answer.

12:54.820 --> 12:58.660
But does it leave the door open to Metal Gear Solid 5?

12:58.660 --> 12:59.660
Actually yes.

12:59.660 --> 13:00.660
Okay.

13:00.660 --> 13:01.660
And I'm not going to-

13:01.660 --> 13:02.660
Is there a dog ending?

13:02.660 --> 13:03.660
That's Silent Hill, dummy.

13:03.660 --> 13:04.660
It doesn't matter.

13:04.660 --> 13:05.660
They can branch out.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.660
All right.

13:06.660 --> 13:14.720
But I do have to say that I was sitting in my little hole in the house being the computer

13:14.720 --> 13:15.720
room.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.720
You know where I'm talking about.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
Right.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.720
Yeah.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
And all of a sudden I hear the Snake Eater theme.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.160
And I'm like, what?

13:22.160 --> 13:30.840
And I just have to say that for fans of the older series, there's major, major nods to

13:30.840 --> 13:33.340
the old Metal Gear series.

13:33.340 --> 13:39.720
And I'm not going to tell you what they are, but it's really, really-

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
Fucking epic.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
And-

13:41.720 --> 13:43.820
The way that they do it is really cool.

13:43.820 --> 13:49.480
And I can't support this game in any way also, by the way, because Solid Snake in the game

13:49.480 --> 13:52.440
uses an Apple iPod.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.440
Oh shut up.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.440
I don't think he-

13:54.440 --> 13:56.800
No, there is an Apple iPod in there.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.800
Just shut up.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
What wonderful product placement.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.880
I don't remember seeing any of that going on in the game, because they were too busy

14:01.880 --> 14:06.320
shooting stuff and talking about love on the battlefield.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.320
Love on the-

14:07.320 --> 14:08.320
Love is a battlefield.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.320
Yeah.

14:09.320 --> 14:14.020
No, it's like this constant spiritual metaphor for-

14:14.020 --> 14:16.880
Do you know what would make Metal Gear Solid 4 better?

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
Snake not being old.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.560
It's a musical.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
Okay the whole-

14:21.560 --> 14:24.120
You know what my subtitle for this game has been?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.120
What?

14:25.120 --> 14:28.680
It's Metal Gear Solid 4, damn Snake, you got old.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
That's it.

14:29.680 --> 14:33.760
That and WTF towards one of the female characters.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.760
Alright.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.760
I gotta say some comments from chat.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.240
Ossifer says, I got MGS4 and it's pretty kick ass.

14:38.240 --> 14:42.400
It's the first game I've ever played in the series, but damn, one word describes it.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
Epic.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
So you know what I'm talking about, right?

14:44.400 --> 14:49.040
One word goes, well, you haven't played the older ones, but you've got an idea now.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.040
That's all I'm gonna say.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.880
Careful with putting that mic there, because the fan- Our studio has been rearranged.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.400
I was telling the listeners earlier.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.940
Now Jamie gets her own couch.

14:56.940 --> 15:01.120
I'm waiting for her to kick her feet up one night and just- It doesn't work there either.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.560
You gotta put it next to you or something.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.560
Where's the ferret?

15:03.560 --> 15:04.560
Where's my baby?

15:04.560 --> 15:05.560
Where's your ferret?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.920
It's in- Your ferret is used in our D&D game, so it's in the house.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.520
You're playing D&D and not tell me?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.520
You wanna come play?

15:13.520 --> 15:14.520
Sure, I can invite you.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.520
Yeah?

15:15.520 --> 15:16.520
We're like level four.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.520
Oh god.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.520
What?

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
Oh god.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
I just like- I gained like- I have a level six wereweasel.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.320
50,000 nerd points with our listeners, like I'm the uber nerd now.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.040
I have a level six wereweasel.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
I'm a bard.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
I'm a level four bard.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
Spoonie bard?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.440
Not quite a- I'm a sassy bard, not a spoonie bard.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.880
My wereweasel has tasted of human before.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.600
But you're- The ferret, because somebody has a ferret familiar in the game, so we actually

15:36.600 --> 15:38.400
use the ferret as the ferret.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.000
Do you remember- You remember Mel and Eric from the DDR days, right?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Yes.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.320
That's what I need to deal with.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.880
The ferret is Mel's companion.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.280
Well, I will talk to peeps.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.360
Well, if it's on Tuesday, I can't do it.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.360
It's not Tuesday.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.360
It's like weekends, usually.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.360
Okay.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.360
All right.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
Cool.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
All right.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.360
Yeah.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.360
Valerno in chat is asking who's breathing into their mic-

15:58.360 --> 16:01.680
This is the fan thing, and I'm not gonna do anything about it, so shut up.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.680
It's the fan.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.480
All she has to do is put her mic down, like not on the arm, but on the- Yeah, just leave

16:06.480 --> 16:07.480
it in your cleavage.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
It'll be fine.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.440
Or put it- Just put it below the arm so the fan's not blowing on it.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
All right.

16:12.440 --> 16:18.360
My face is above the arm line, so I need like a shield over the mic.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
All right.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
Forget it.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.400
Xenocore says, Sky, you better be playing version four or you're lame.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.920
We started playing before four was out, because four just came out.

16:25.920 --> 16:26.920
You know what?

16:26.920 --> 16:33.760
Fuck everybody, because it's all about version two.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.760
Oh.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
Two and 2.5.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
Why you gotta bring THAC0 into this?

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
Hell yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.840
I can still calculate THAC0.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.560
All right, look.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.280
We've really gotta get back to video games.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.760
I want to say another quick thing about Metal Gear Solid 4.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.840
I just noticed this on Digg earlier today.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.880
Apparently GameSpot has given Metal Gear Solid 4 a 10 out of 10.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.400
It's only the sixth game in history to do so.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.040
Do you think this is a game that's deserving of all the praise- What if I need to give

17:01.040 --> 17:02.040
it?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
Ah, 40.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.880
So- Do you think it's deserving- I trust- I trust

17:04.880 --> 17:10.000
fund me to over GameStop- Well, they also gave Nintendogs a 40 if I remember

17:10.000 --> 17:11.800
right, so I'm a little- But Nintendogs was great.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
For five minutes.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
But more like five days.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.800
All right, I'll give you that.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
Actually more like five weeks.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.800
Five days.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.800
Because about five weeks is when I started getting tired of it, and I guarantee you a

17:20.800 --> 17:24.520
month from now people are going to be Metal Gear what?

17:24.520 --> 17:29.720
Because people have that kind of attention span that would be none.

17:29.720 --> 17:36.800
Xenocore in chat says fuck Thacko, and Kekoman2Dx says they apparently took bards out of four.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.560
Do fuck fourth edition if that's the case.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.280
Dude, it's- Fuck it right and it's here.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.080
It's all about second edition and playing a freaking, uh, uh, Bladesinger.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.080
All right.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.640
It's all about it.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.640
Enough D&D chat.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.920
It's all about custom spells and the flesh to toast spell.

17:50.920 --> 17:51.920
No!

17:51.920 --> 17:54.760
No, the best spell ever, and I have to tell everybody about this.

17:54.760 --> 17:55.760
My friend- Oh god.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.600
My friend Derek, by the way, congrag- I know you're not listening, but congratulations for

17:58.600 --> 18:05.800
getting married, um, last week, um, he, um, had a character named Blackstar who created

18:05.800 --> 18:08.580
a spell called Blackstar's Instant Chaos.

18:08.580 --> 18:13.560
And so far, I think we got to about five pages, but it was supposed to be ten pages of a hundred

18:13.560 --> 18:16.960
effects so the spell would have a thousand effects, random.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.880
We've had Jesus in our game before.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.800
We've had golf umbrellas pop up.

18:20.800 --> 18:26.400
We have had, um, a Mortal Kombat machine land on a lich.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.580
All sorts of funny things happen in this game.

18:28.580 --> 18:33.160
And also, um, one of my characters actually had a breast enlargement by accident because

18:33.160 --> 18:34.160
of the spell.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.160
Can we talk video games now?

18:35.160 --> 18:36.640
I just thought I'd share that.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
All right.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.200
The best spell ever.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.880
I do like that and I fully endorse that in any, you know, upcoming RPG.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.320
Oh my god, SSJ100Matt hit the nail on the head.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.360
We substituted food talk tonight with D&D talk.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.360
At least we're- These french fries suck, by the way.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.880
At least we're getting part way there.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.480
At least we're talking about games of some sort tonight.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.680
I had tiramisu ice cream today.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.680
All right.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.680
Look.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.680
And it was great!

19:00.680 --> 19:05.440
We're going to get to talking about video games, but first, some housekeeping news.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.160
A very happy Father's Day to all our gamer daddies who are out there listening.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.200
It is June 15th of 2008 as we're taping this live.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
It is Father's Day.

19:14.200 --> 19:18.240
So, uh, to all of our gamer dads who happen to be listening to the show, happy Father's

19:18.240 --> 19:19.560
Day.

19:19.560 --> 19:23.840
All games dot com was hack sword earlier this week, which kind of sucks.

19:23.840 --> 19:28.680
I don't know why people keep hacking all games dot com because they are only doing good for

19:28.680 --> 19:33.880
the gaming community, but I guess some people want to hack it just because they can and

19:33.880 --> 19:35.560
like the challenge.

19:35.560 --> 19:39.360
So folks are having to listen to us tonight through- directly through all games radio

19:39.360 --> 19:40.360
dot com.

19:40.360 --> 19:44.940
From what I hear though, all games dot com is completely being redesigned and there's

19:44.940 --> 19:48.520
going to be a complete new site in its place soon.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.560
And I wish someone would do the same for OrangeLaunchRadio dot com because damn our old site's getting

19:51.560 --> 19:52.560
old.

19:52.560 --> 20:01.960
So, um, next week on the show, episode number 284 is the sixth anniversary of OrangeLaunchRadio

20:01.960 --> 20:03.120
if you can believe it.

20:03.120 --> 20:07.840
A day early for all practical sake, but it's the closest day that falls to our anniversary.

20:07.840 --> 20:14.080
The very first episode of OrangeLaunchRadio is June 23rd, 2002, where such topics included

20:14.080 --> 20:17.680
us talking about keyboard mania at our local Roseville Golf Land.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.560
And we've come a long, long way in six years and we're going to be talking a lot about

20:21.560 --> 20:22.600
that next week.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.320
Although I did put the word out there.

20:24.320 --> 20:28.240
I asked the listeners, what do you want to see for the sixth anniversary of OrangeLaunchRadio?

20:28.240 --> 20:30.400
I'm very disappointed in the lack of feedback.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.600
There were like a couple people that made suggestions and when I say a couple, I literally

20:33.600 --> 20:34.880
mean like two.

20:34.880 --> 20:41.360
So make a suggestion now.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.840
I will be very, very disappointed with you.

20:44.840 --> 20:45.840
Where can they send suggestions?

20:45.840 --> 20:46.840
In chat?

20:46.840 --> 20:47.840
Mailbag.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.840
All right.

20:48.840 --> 20:49.840
It's a mailbag.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.840
It's a mailbag.

20:50.840 --> 20:51.840
In chat.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.840
I can't guarantee.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
I'll read it, but you can do it and we'll see what happens.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
All right.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.600
Cause right now we're just going to do the same old shit we've been doing for the past

20:57.600 --> 20:58.600
six years.

20:58.600 --> 21:04.880
Make a goddamn suggestion before I go into your dreams and stab you in your imaginations.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.440
Have you had a bad day, DarkSakura?

21:06.440 --> 21:07.440
Yes.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.440
All right.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.440
I had to go back for my fucking laptop.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.480
All right.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.480
Let's see.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.320
Rama says, let Travis roast the host.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.520
I don't know about that idea.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.800
I don't know if I could take that.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.520
If he hasn't enough outside the show.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.280
Misty says, but I no has any ideas.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.280
Cry.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.280
Make one.

21:27.280 --> 21:32.320
All right, look, we've got a lot of gaming news to get to tonight.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.160
We have late breaking news.

21:35.160 --> 21:39.320
For all practical purposes, this was a slow news week up until about two, three hours

21:39.320 --> 21:43.520
ago when I think the roof just got blown off of something.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.960
Now, granted, these are rumors.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.200
Loki, what the hell is going on?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
Update us on the latest.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.120
This isn't even on our list of tonight's stories, but this is huge.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.120
This isn't even.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.120
I wouldn't say this is rumors.

21:52.120 --> 21:57.240
I would say it's a little bit above rumors since this is actually coming from a survey

21:57.240 --> 22:04.560
site called Intellis, I guess, Intellisponse.com.

22:04.560 --> 22:11.640
Apparently my guess is someone got some sort of survey based on one of these news items

22:11.640 --> 22:15.560
and then figured out, hey, look, I can go back in the directories here a little bit.

22:15.560 --> 22:19.040
Oh, look at all this other stuff.

22:19.040 --> 22:23.640
There's everything from mainly Activision and Microsoft stuff.

22:23.640 --> 22:32.920
The big juicy stuff, of course, number one being avatars coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.800
They actually have a picture of some avatars, including someone that looks like they're

22:35.800 --> 22:40.060
dressed up like Winnie the Pooh, which is kind of weird.

22:40.060 --> 22:46.320
It says avatars are digital personas available this holiday for all Xbox Live connected members

22:46.320 --> 22:50.200
and the spring for all new console owners.

22:50.200 --> 22:55.340
Avatars will be used in place of the gamer picture you have today and give you a much

22:55.340 --> 23:02.560
more lifelike animated, fully customizable persona for you to reflect who you are online.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.560
Oh, we're getting Miis.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.560
Pretty much.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.160
I would say these are a step up from Miis, but essentially, yeah.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.880
Their Miis second mix.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.160
That's what it is.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.640
Miis club mix.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.600
Yes, exactly.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.920
OK, so let's see here.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.080
There's also information about Guitar Hero 4.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.800
The instrument bundles are supposed to cost one hundred seventy nine dollars with, you

23:27.800 --> 23:34.160
know, the same kind of stuff you get in like rock band, drum set, guitar, microphone and

23:34.160 --> 23:35.160
the game.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.160
It's supposed to be one hundred seventy nine dollars.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.040
I'd say that's about right.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.360
And some new information about the Guitar Hero 4 guitar.

23:43.360 --> 23:49.400
It will be upgraded and will feature new touch sensitive neck, which will allow you to do

23:49.400 --> 23:54.300
neck slides and opens up the entire guitar neck for unbound solos.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.400
Shred how you want.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.160
And then some of the artists that they mentioned for Guitar Hero 4.

23:59.160 --> 24:04.680
Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne,

24:04.680 --> 24:08.240
Interpol, Muse and dozens more.

24:08.240 --> 24:14.960
And let's see here also, there is some information about remember a while ago, Lips appeared

24:14.960 --> 24:18.760
on a press site for some Microsoft announcement.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.760
I do.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.760
Yes.

24:20.760 --> 24:26.160
Well, Lips is a music and singing game that's going to include 30 songs and two wireless

24:26.160 --> 24:31.740
interactive microphones, the ability to use and sing your own music or download songs

24:31.740 --> 24:33.460
from an online service.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.760
It's designed to have fun with your friends.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.560
Lips scores you on your singing, pitch, rhythm and tune and overall performance.

24:39.560 --> 24:44.440
The wireless mics are interactive with lights on the shaft of the microphone that pulse

24:44.440 --> 24:49.600
with the rhythm of your voice and motion sensors that allow you to dance and move or swing

24:49.600 --> 24:51.840
to score points.

24:51.840 --> 24:56.620
And then you can take songs from your CD or iPod and upload them into the game.

24:56.620 --> 25:02.320
I'm sure they also mean to say Zune as well since this is an Xbox 360.

25:02.320 --> 25:07.920
And the game will reduce the vocals down so that you can sing along and be heard and score

25:07.920 --> 25:10.020
on whether you're in tune or not.

25:10.020 --> 25:15.600
And lyrics can be added directly into the song to sing aloud.

25:15.600 --> 25:21.640
There is a new Tony Hawk game that's going to be using a motion sensing board controller

25:21.640 --> 25:24.320
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.200
In fact, I'm going to try to find this here real quick.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.760
This is from a screenshot.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.280
This is from chat while you're looking for that, Game Guru said, tomorrow's news and

25:33.280 --> 25:36.360
tell a response out of business.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.800
I don't know, but people are going to be pissed.

25:38.800 --> 25:43.360
I mean, with all these like news stories coming out, did E3 just get ruined?

25:43.360 --> 25:47.960
A lot of their big, I think big splashes may have gotten ruined a little bit.

25:47.960 --> 25:48.960
With this whole app.

25:48.960 --> 25:53.560
So we have Microsoft, OK, they've taken the Miis and made it a little better with the

25:53.560 --> 25:55.600
whole avatars thing.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.320
They've taken the whole karaoke revolution SingStar thing and made it a little better

25:59.320 --> 26:02.920
with this lip sing and this whole like that you can put in any song, you get the vocals

26:02.920 --> 26:03.920
taken out.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.080
That's like a big freaking deal, although it probably won't work perfectly.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.600
That's still kind of a neat feature that the other games don't have.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.160
I mean, this is interesting.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.360
Oh my God.

26:12.360 --> 26:18.400
And this just in, I just saw this and tell a response has also apparently found the theme

26:18.400 --> 26:22.160
song from Microsoft's press conference for E3 this year.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.160
This is amazing.

26:23.160 --> 26:38.280
We have a clip.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.280
All right.

26:39.280 --> 26:44.880
Anyways, the Tony Hawk game, I guess is the current name right now is Tony Hawk's Adrenaline.

26:44.880 --> 26:50.300
It's going to feature a new motion sensing board controller that takes your game off

26:50.300 --> 26:53.960
the couch and launches you into the ultimate skateboarding experience.

26:53.960 --> 26:58.000
Thanks to an intuitive board based control scheme, it's never been easier to pull off

26:58.000 --> 27:01.520
amazing tricks and feel the sensation of skateboarding.

27:01.520 --> 27:06.480
Shift your weight to turn and balance grinds, kick back on the tail of the board to ollie

27:06.480 --> 27:08.880
and lean into errors and pull off huge spins.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.520
Feel the sensation of dropping the 60 foot mega ramp bombing down the world's steepest

27:12.520 --> 27:18.520
streets and watching earth disappear behind your board as you launch out of a half pipe.

27:18.520 --> 27:23.920
Question, graphics amplify the fun as you ride thrilling situations like these, put

27:23.920 --> 27:28.000
down the controller step on the board and feel the sensation of going big.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.400
And they say it's going to be 59.99 for the PS3 and Xbox 360.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.560
I'm guessing if it's going to come with a board, it's not going to be that price.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.640
Anyways, let's see here.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.280
What else we got here?

27:42.280 --> 27:43.280
This is interesting.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.040
I'm not sure what the hell this is though.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.760
It's something called Trioxide and it says, introducing the ability to play the latest

27:49.760 --> 27:54.400
console games, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii on your PC.

27:54.400 --> 28:01.280
Many of these games are only available on consoles today and with this new feature,

28:01.280 --> 28:04.760
they will now be available on the PC as well.

28:04.760 --> 28:08.400
This is with this feature, those console games are now playable on your PC.

28:08.400 --> 28:13.120
Use the same game controllers as the original console systems.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.800
All games use regular console controllers, not your computer, keyboard, or mouse.

28:16.800 --> 28:21.720
Now see, I read an interesting theory on that whole thread that was going on on NeoGAF where

28:21.720 --> 28:26.440
this whole thing exploded, that Trioxide was a possible codename for Xbox 360 because they

28:26.440 --> 28:30.960
saw some prices in here, 49 and 299, and people were speculating that maybe 49 is the new

28:30.960 --> 28:36.720
price of the controllers and 299 is this new system skew that a lot of folks are speculating

28:36.720 --> 28:40.680
Microsoft's going to drop on us at E3 because I guess it's not uncommon for Xbox to use

28:40.680 --> 28:45.520
names of like, chemicals, because I think helium was a codename of theirs once.

28:45.520 --> 28:54.360
Well, Trioxide, let's see, that would be, um, Ozone, yeah, O3, no, maybe, okay, I think

28:54.360 --> 29:00.200
this is why, I think this is why we're in this territory of, it's rumors, but slightly

29:00.200 --> 29:04.340
above it, you know, like there's got to be some fact to this, I mean, this company is

29:04.340 --> 29:10.080
legit, there's a lot of smoke coming from this, right, but there's, there's probably

29:10.080 --> 29:15.560
some red herrings amongst this because what these people did is they were basically sending

29:15.560 --> 29:19.400
out surveys, marketing research, and that's how this whole thing got blown, is that if

29:19.400 --> 29:25.120
you go to one of those websites, ran this whole Avatars thing because it was, somebody

29:25.120 --> 29:29.720
sent it to them confidentially from this website that they were being asked about this whole

29:29.720 --> 29:35.300
Avatars thing on a research, well then that link got taken and some people blew it wide

29:35.300 --> 29:38.200
open and found all the other surveys that were out there too, that's how this whole

29:38.200 --> 29:39.200
thing started.

29:39.200 --> 29:44.560
I mean, there's some legitimacy to this underneath, but there's still a lot being drafted to it.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.320
Okay, let's see what else we've got here.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.800
Um...

29:47.800 --> 29:52.680
Scenic Pop Culture Edition makes perfect sense since they've already come out with a scenic game there.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.920
The groundwork's already there, so I can see that happening.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.720
Extreme Makeover Home Edition for the Wii and DS.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.960
Uh, I can see that too.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.840
Gossip Girl for the Wii and DS.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.760
What?

30:04.760 --> 30:07.720
Ultimate Band for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

30:07.720 --> 30:12.160
That, if I remember correctly, Ultimate Band, I know for the Wii, is a Buena Vista game.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.320
That's, um, or Disney Interactive, yes.

30:15.320 --> 30:19.880
And that, it is a band game that does not use instruments, and that's something that's already been announced.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.800
You can play Hannah Montana songs to your heart's content.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.400
I guess, yeah.

30:23.400 --> 30:28.640
Uh, Wii Yoga, which I guess is supposed to follow along an inspirational yoga guru, instructor,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.840
machine, all these on-screen poses, stretches.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.320
Wasn't there yoga in Wii Fit?

30:32.320 --> 30:34.080
Well, this is something else, okay?

30:34.080 --> 30:37.520
So, someone else, I mean, there's a lot of yoga games out there, trust me.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.880
Um, I've seen them, I have to sell them, it sucks.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.280
They have some stuff on Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

30:43.280 --> 30:47.760
Um, a bunch of, you know, because this is a lot of Activision stuff on here, um, in

30:47.760 --> 30:53.240
this new Marvel Ultimate Alliance action role-playing game, civil war erupts, and the world's greatest

30:53.240 --> 30:55.680
heroes and villains must choose sides.

30:55.680 --> 31:00.480
Select your side in the conflict and assemble your team of a roster of 20 Marvel Legends,

31:00.480 --> 31:04.960
including Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, and the Human Torch.

31:04.960 --> 31:10.480
Combine your team's power and the blah blah blah, it says, um, you can also fuse different

31:10.480 --> 31:16.600
powers between characters, such as fusing Spider-Man's powers with Storm to give Spider-Man

31:16.600 --> 31:19.200
lightning webs, so that's kind of neat.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
I do not want.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.200
That's weird.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.000
Um, so, yeah, and there's some other stuff.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.960
I know, this has already been announced that's coming out, so that's not a surprise.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.680
This is new, though, Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.120
The Marvel Zombies series is just crazy.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
Wow.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.480
I don't know if you've read any of them, but they're nuts, and there was an Army of Darkness

31:39.480 --> 31:41.040
vs. Marvel Zombies 2.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.040
I thought you'd look like that.

31:42.040 --> 31:45.680
So, there's going to be a set in the popular Marvel Zombies comic series.

31:45.680 --> 31:50.960
You assume the role of Spider-Man and must save the world from zombie menaces that threaten

31:50.960 --> 31:52.160
to destroy it.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.880
Um, play this adventure game in an open city, free-swing environment, and a war-torn Earth,

31:56.880 --> 32:01.240
and the game takes place in the year 2149 in the warped version of Earth.

32:01.240 --> 32:06.600
Um, fight against other Marvel heroes and villains who you've already, who have already

32:06.600 --> 32:10.320
succumbed to the zombie horde, or become a zombie yourself.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.420
So, that's interesting.

32:12.420 --> 32:15.160
I'm guessing that's probably coming out next year sometime.

32:15.160 --> 32:21.440
Uh, Transformers 2 probably will suck, because the first one really sucked.

32:21.440 --> 32:26.280
Obviously, this is something that's way far away, but probably going to come out around

32:26.280 --> 32:28.960
the time of the next movie.

32:28.960 --> 32:34.960
So, I think that was 2010, so, way, way off there.

32:34.960 --> 32:41.840
And they have some generic stuff on that, um, let's see here, um, okay, this is a little

32:41.840 --> 32:42.840
bit bigger.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.840
Well, actually, this is weird too.

32:43.840 --> 32:49.480
They have a balance board game using, or it's a Spider-Man game using the balance board.

32:49.480 --> 32:56.280
It says, um, it might be Spider-Man's heart that keeps him going, or maybe his strength.

32:56.280 --> 33:00.360
Step on, or step into Spider-Man's shoes and decide for yourself.

33:00.360 --> 33:03.480
One jump, leap, stomp, and kick at a time.

33:03.480 --> 33:09.600
Climb atop your Wii Fit board to control Spider-Man's acrobatic abilities like never before.

33:09.600 --> 33:14.160
Lean one way or the other to send Spider-Man's story into the air.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.720
Jump as high as you can to propel, uh, Spider-Man off of Manhattan's tallest rooftops.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.840
I don't see how you could do that, because they don't want you jumping on the Wii balance

33:21.840 --> 33:24.720
board, so, it'll be interesting.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.760
Hmm, that's true.

33:26.760 --> 33:31.640
Um, let's see here, Tiger Claw says the sequel is going to be called Transformers 2 Revenge

33:31.640 --> 33:34.120
of the Fallen from our chat room.

33:34.120 --> 33:38.680
Uh, then they had some stuff for Call of Duty 5, mainly 5 different box shots so that they're

33:38.680 --> 33:43.800
deciding between, um, what they want to use, same with the Spider-Man web of shadows.

33:43.800 --> 33:49.560
Finally the biggest one, um, this is coming from Forza 3, they had some stuff on that.

33:49.560 --> 33:53.800
Forza 3, of course, you know, big racing game, uh, it says do the number of cars and tracks

33:53.800 --> 33:59.120
included in Forza 3, it will be sold as a 2-disc set, it says, uh, key features of Forza

33:59.120 --> 34:05.760
3 include highly detailed real world cars and track models, over 400 cars and 100 tracks,

34:05.760 --> 34:12.040
near limitless customization options for cartooning and custom artwork, a variety of online community

34:12.040 --> 34:18.080
features, highly accurate racing simulation, including real world damage, new race modes,

34:18.080 --> 34:23.560
drag, drift, oval, point to point racing, etc., uh, powerful assist system to help new

34:23.560 --> 34:28.200
players get into the game quickly, and, what else?

34:28.200 --> 34:31.520
But all that is subject to change, obviously, because he's probably thinking that, yeah.

34:31.520 --> 34:36.200
Yeah, this is all stuff that's going on right now, and it says also imagine that an exclusive

34:36.200 --> 34:41.440
Forza 3 limited collector's edition was released that would include the full version of the

34:41.440 --> 34:46.480
game plus membership in a special VIP program that would entitle the buyer to all future

34:46.480 --> 34:53.380
Forza 3 downloadable content, access to exclusive online race events and prizes, VIP status

34:53.380 --> 34:59.420
on Forza auction house and community boards, extra service space for photos and videos

34:59.420 --> 35:05.000
in a free month of live, and the collector's edition will also include exclusive motorsports

35:05.000 --> 35:09.840
content not found anywhere else, and it says this can be anything from authentic racing

35:09.840 --> 35:14.400
gear, gloves, helmets, etc., to specially created automobile and manufactured gear,

35:14.400 --> 35:17.760
branded jackets, etc., to VIP motorsport event tickets.

35:17.760 --> 35:22.840
See, that sounds kind of cool, but like, this stuff's so early that it's probably just,

35:22.840 --> 35:27.480
you know, what they want to do, and they're also kind of getting people's opinions on

35:27.480 --> 35:28.480
this stuff.

35:28.480 --> 35:33.760
You know, and if you dig even deeper in that NeoJF thread, people kept finding more stuff

35:33.760 --> 35:38.600
on that site, like, I don't know, I didn't read into how the security hole was opened

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
or whatever, but.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.760
It basically, well, I saw it earlier before they took everything down.

35:42.760 --> 35:43.760
Oh, it's fixed now?

35:43.760 --> 35:47.420
Because, yeah, it is fixed now, and there's some other stuff that was on there too, including

35:47.420 --> 35:54.700
there's a game for, it was called Crucible that they had a video for.

35:54.700 --> 35:58.920
Animal Planet Emergency Vet was a game that was on there, you know, like the show on Animal

35:58.920 --> 36:00.320
Planet.

36:00.320 --> 36:05.280
Bill Nye Science Lab on the Wii, no joke, Bill Nye the Science Guy finally gets a Wii

36:05.280 --> 36:06.360
game.

36:06.360 --> 36:10.120
That was like one of our dream games, wasn't it, I don't know, and then get this, You Don't

36:10.120 --> 36:15.480
Know Jack on the Wii, finally, finally this game's coming back, thank God.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.920
I know two other games that haven't been mentioned yet.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.080
Oh, really?

36:20.080 --> 36:23.040
They're also based off, like, TV shows, actually.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.040
Oh.

36:24.040 --> 36:31.160
Hell's Kitchen is getting a game, which I think is kind of funny, and The Price is Right.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.080
Hell yeah!

36:33.080 --> 36:34.080
What for Wii?

36:34.080 --> 36:37.000
Wii and DS.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.080
I don't know, though, it probably's gonna suck.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.400
You just can't play Plinko at home, it's not the same, you know what I mean?

36:43.400 --> 36:44.400
It's just not the same.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.880
I don't know.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Alright.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.640
They had a Price is Right game on Commodore 64, didn't they?

36:49.640 --> 36:50.640
Years ago?

36:50.640 --> 36:52.160
They had some pretty old ones.

36:52.160 --> 36:56.240
I was seeing some other stuff on here, too, and I'm sure a lot of people now are starting

36:56.240 --> 37:04.680
to make up stuff to go along with this, but, I don't know, it's interesting.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.520
I think a lot of the stuff you're going to see at E3, and shit, it's only a few more

37:08.520 --> 37:09.520
weeks away, really.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.960
I mean, E3, what, a month away?

37:10.960 --> 37:15.520
Well, I'm very curious to see what the fallout from all of this is, what the response is

37:15.520 --> 37:16.520
from Microsoft tomorrow.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.600
Oh, it's going to be a lot of do not comment shit, that's all it's going to be.

37:18.600 --> 37:22.880
I'm very curious to see Microsoft's comment tomorrow, besides, you know, the standard

37:22.880 --> 37:26.880
anything you can do, I can do better.

37:26.880 --> 37:27.880
It is very interesting.

37:27.880 --> 37:31.720
It sounds like they do have a lot of stuff up their sleeves.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.880
And they said they had a few aces still up their sleeves for stuff, so.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.600
Well, A for Ace Avatar, I don't know.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
Alright.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.320
And after Matt says in chat, Price is Right for the Wii, Itagaki better do it, so he get

37:42.320 --> 37:47.080
the bouncy titties, because you know that's why people watch the Price is Right.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.080
Oh my God.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.080
Come on down!

37:49.080 --> 37:50.080
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.080
They should totally.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.080
Too bad it's all grandmas.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.080
Totally.

37:53.080 --> 37:59.000
Like we were saying back, you know, last week, how Itagaki would do, like, you know, how

37:59.000 --> 38:03.160
I appear, he would do, like, a press event or whatever, you know, kicking over stuff,

38:03.160 --> 38:06.160
you know, saying things on fire, that kind of thing.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.560
That would apply to Price is Right, too.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.760
I think that would be pretty awesome.

38:08.760 --> 38:09.760
That would be.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.760
We're making a Price is Right game, bitch.

38:11.760 --> 38:12.760
Alright.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.080
Alright, so definitely lots more to come.

38:15.080 --> 38:18.760
That story, of course, all still in development, was very new.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.600
We'll see how this develops throughout the week.

38:20.600 --> 38:24.160
Meanwhile, let's get into the news we were going to talk about anyway tonight, even though

38:24.160 --> 38:27.020
that took like 20 minutes to cover, but that's pretty big.

38:27.020 --> 38:30.360
Let's quickly run through some of the other week's news and let you guys comment.

38:30.360 --> 38:31.360
Alright.

38:31.360 --> 38:39.920
Christopher says, Microsoft's comment, fuck, you didn't just hear that.

38:39.920 --> 38:45.080
Nintendo is suing Nyko over the Comma Wireless Nunchuk, which doesn't really make much sense

38:45.080 --> 38:48.800
to me when I think about it, because, you know, people put out third party accessories

38:48.800 --> 38:49.920
all the time.

38:49.920 --> 38:54.240
I guess Nintendo is just really super anal about people putting out, you know, third

38:54.240 --> 38:57.880
party remotes and nunchucks, because actually if you think about it, I remember Mad Cats

38:57.880 --> 39:03.200
was putting out a third party remote that kind of looked like a dildo, but actually

39:03.200 --> 39:05.000
that's never come out yet.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.640
So I'm wondering if these people are just getting blocked by Nintendo for this stuff,

39:09.640 --> 39:16.680
but either way, they are suing them because apparently it appropriates the novel shape,

39:16.680 --> 39:23.120
design, overall appearance, and even the colored materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuk controller.

39:23.120 --> 39:27.760
Except it's also wireless, but apparently it's similar enough, and people are thinking

39:27.760 --> 39:30.800
hey, maybe Nintendo is making their own wireless nunchuck.

39:30.800 --> 39:35.000
I doubt that, but, I don't know, it still sucks.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.120
So if you're looking to buy a wireless nunchuck, do it now, before they're pulled from shelves.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.060
Do you think this has any merit on Nintendo's part?

39:43.060 --> 39:47.640
It's just weird because there's tons of third party controllers out there, why this one?

39:47.640 --> 39:52.400
It's true that, you know, it has merit, but at the same time though, I thought that this

39:52.400 --> 39:58.120
stuff has to be approved through Nintendo first, before they make these peripherals,

39:58.120 --> 40:00.360
they have to approve it with Nintendo.

40:00.360 --> 40:04.240
Because the same could be said with the Wii Zapper, there's a bunch of things that came

40:04.240 --> 40:09.040
out before the Wii Zapper that were pretty much exactly the same as the Wii Zapper.

40:09.040 --> 40:14.060
And some things, in fact, Nyko even made a better peripheral than the Wii Zapper for

40:14.060 --> 40:15.060
gun games.

40:15.060 --> 40:18.240
But I don't know, it sucks.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.960
I don't know, because it's something that people want, so they're going to buy it.

40:21.960 --> 40:26.000
I don't think they're going to lose any nunchuck sales on this, maybe they will a little bit,

40:26.000 --> 40:30.980
but they're really, I don't know, money hungry if that's the case.

40:30.980 --> 40:36.840
But I guess at the same time, they also have to protect their patents and stuff, so maybe

40:36.840 --> 40:38.140
that's why they're doing this.

40:38.140 --> 40:43.280
But either way though, there should have been some sort of process where they have to get

40:43.280 --> 40:49.040
approval from Nintendo to put out these products, or I don't know, usually that's the way it

40:49.040 --> 40:52.160
works I thought.

40:52.160 --> 40:57.280
All right, well we'll see what happens if they get the pants suit off of them, or what

40:57.280 --> 40:58.440
will happen.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.120
But you think Nintendo just want to put out a wireless thing of their own, is that what's

41:01.120 --> 41:02.120
going on?

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
I don't know.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.760
Jamie, what do you think of this whole lawsuit stuff?

41:05.760 --> 41:11.080
I think it's just Nintendo trying to keep the market under their control.

41:11.080 --> 41:16.200
Well, Nintendo did this this week, and it's not Nintendo as a company, but one person

41:16.200 --> 41:19.920
at Nintendo, but when you hire a person like this as your marketing director, he's speaking

41:19.920 --> 41:24.900
on behalf of your company, and this guy pissed me off this week, I don't know about you guys.

41:24.900 --> 41:31.920
This was in Edge Magazine, and Nintendo of Europe marketing director, Laurent Fisher,

41:31.920 --> 41:36.840
was talking about the whole, he got of course, as most Nintendo people have, got kind of

41:36.840 --> 41:40.120
put on the spot lately while he was talking about WiiWare games.

41:40.120 --> 41:43.000
Where is the extra storage?

41:43.000 --> 41:47.240
What about all these people that are filling up their Wii consoles with all this stuff?

41:47.240 --> 41:48.480
Where is the extra storage?

41:48.480 --> 41:55.720
Well, according to Laurent Fisher, only geeks and otaku want the issue addressed.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.280
Here's the actual quote from the magazine here.

41:58.280 --> 42:01.720
You can read their little site online at next-gen.biz.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.400
When a question about the limited Wii system memory was raised, Nintendo's Laurent Fisher

42:05.400 --> 42:10.720
slipped into talking about how geeks and otaku were the only people who would want this issue

42:10.720 --> 42:11.720
addressed.

42:11.720 --> 42:15.520
Yeah, that would be their entire fan base.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.120
Duh.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.440
Then he went and tried to backtrack a little later.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.440
He was talking to video gaming 24-7.

42:23.440 --> 42:27.680
He didn't mean to offend anyone, and it's all a misunderstanding.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.680
You know what?

42:28.680 --> 42:35.120
I don't know how much more cut and dry that could be, or how that could be misconstrued

42:35.120 --> 42:36.520
to mean anything else.

42:36.520 --> 42:41.680
Geek and otaku, first of all, apart from being slightly synonymous, except with otaku having

42:41.680 --> 42:49.280
a slightly bigger social stigma overseas, is still...

42:49.280 --> 42:52.400
Your freaking marketing director?

42:52.400 --> 42:54.000
You want to appeal to these people.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.520
I know Nintendo is trying to get the broader audience and trying to get the moms and grandmoms

42:58.520 --> 43:05.800
into it, but still, their core fan base is the nerdy gamer, sorry.

43:05.800 --> 43:06.800
And here's the problem.

43:06.800 --> 43:12.360
Every particular geek has spent lots of money on these virtual console downloads, downloading

43:12.360 --> 43:17.360
the same shit I played years ago, when I could be playing them for free on the internet.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.880
But no, I decided to support Nintendo.

43:19.880 --> 43:24.280
I decided to download these games and actually pay the price for them so I could have the

43:24.280 --> 43:28.560
official emulator and support the people behind it, and this is how we get thanked?

43:28.560 --> 43:30.720
I downloaded ZSNES.

43:30.720 --> 43:31.720
I know, that's what I'm saying.

43:31.720 --> 43:35.520
I could have done that, and I could have never supported the whole virtual console thing.

43:35.520 --> 43:39.320
I would have the space on my drive to do more WiiWare games, and I wouldn't have to worry

43:39.320 --> 43:41.520
about any of this.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.000
No.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.400
But then, this is the thanks we get for supporting Nintendo.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.200
You're a geek.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.080
So you know what?

43:49.080 --> 43:51.120
Fuck you.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.440
I am not downloading anything else on virtual console.

43:54.440 --> 43:55.440
I don't give a shit.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.920
They could put Guardian Legend out on it tomorrow.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.920
I'm not getting it.

43:58.920 --> 44:02.840
I will play it on NES emulators, thank you very much, and be happy.

44:02.840 --> 44:05.400
I will not download any more WiiWare titles.

44:05.400 --> 44:12.640
I will not support Nintendo's download service until A, this guy is let go or shifted into

44:12.640 --> 44:16.720
another position where he's not speaking on behalf of the company, or B, Nintendo addresses

44:16.720 --> 44:17.720
this issue.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
That's it.

44:18.720 --> 44:24.760
Personally, I'm not going to suffer because of one idiot, but I think that it would probably

44:24.760 --> 44:31.640
be a bit more, I would have to say, well, first of all, they're not going to know that

44:31.640 --> 44:37.080
you're doing this if you just do it and they're not going to listen to our podcast.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.080
I know.

44:38.080 --> 44:42.780
I'm hoping maybe some of the listeners will kind of wake up as well and maybe join me

44:42.780 --> 44:43.860
in this little boycott.

44:43.860 --> 44:50.360
I think that a movement, and I'm going to use that term, has no real power unless the

44:50.360 --> 44:55.440
ones you're moving against know what you're doing.

44:55.440 --> 45:02.320
So why not put together some type of organized effort to address it?

45:02.320 --> 45:06.660
It's one thing to say we're going to do this on the show, but another thing to actually

45:06.660 --> 45:12.720
send a letter to Nintendo, to the CEO US, to the ones in the UK.

45:12.720 --> 45:17.340
So are you saying I should start some type of blog where I encourage people to send letters

45:17.340 --> 45:18.340
and join me in this boycott?

45:18.340 --> 45:19.340
Why not?

45:19.340 --> 45:20.340
All right.

45:20.340 --> 45:21.340
I'll do it tomorrow.

45:21.340 --> 45:22.340
Okay.

45:22.340 --> 45:23.340
All right.

45:23.340 --> 45:24.340
We're doing it.

45:24.340 --> 45:25.340
We are?

45:25.340 --> 45:26.340
We are.

45:26.340 --> 45:27.340
We're doing it.

45:27.340 --> 45:28.340
Okay.

45:28.340 --> 45:29.340
And you're signing it.

45:29.340 --> 45:30.340
Hey, I'm fine with it.

45:30.340 --> 45:33.180
I haven't really been downloading anything from Nintendo's WiiWare service anyways.

45:33.180 --> 45:35.660
My download service actually isn't working, but I did want posting once now.

45:35.660 --> 45:39.340
That's the thing is I've been trying to support Nintendo and that's why you might just think,

45:39.340 --> 45:44.180
Rob, get over it, but it's one of these things where like, dude, this is the marketing director.

45:44.180 --> 45:45.180
This is what he's going to say.

45:45.180 --> 45:47.500
Isn't that marketing director UK?

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
It doesn't matter.

45:48.500 --> 45:56.140
But I'm saying, you know, we're going to have to, the letters have to go to him, to whoever

45:56.140 --> 46:05.420
his boss is in Nintendo UK, to over here and probably even to the overall head officer.

46:05.420 --> 46:10.020
You know, dark Tetsuya says, Oh, please, Rob, you'll download the guardian legend if they

46:10.020 --> 46:11.020
put it out tomorrow.

46:11.020 --> 46:12.020
No, I won't.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.680
Rob can come over to my house and play it.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.680
I can play.

46:14.680 --> 46:19.220
Go download it on an emulator and I guess I'll be just fine.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.060
Just fine.

46:21.060 --> 46:22.060
So there you have it.

46:22.060 --> 46:23.060
Let's see.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.060
What does Game Guru say?

46:24.060 --> 46:26.660
Nintendo will fix the issue for Animal Crossing at E3.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.540
If they don't, I will join this boycott.

46:29.540 --> 46:34.580
Game Guru, I actually think my boycott will be over by E3 because I think, like I said,

46:34.580 --> 46:42.940
I will un-boycott when they address this issue finally and stop pretending it doesn't exist.

46:42.940 --> 46:47.580
And if it doesn't get addressed, then it just justifies the boycott even more.

46:47.580 --> 46:54.860
So it's still one thing has got to get enough people to participate when a shadow try says,

46:54.860 --> 46:56.060
Oh, now you go back on it.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.060
No, I'm not.

46:57.060 --> 47:00.160
I said the boycott will be over when a, this guy gets let go or B, Nintendo addresses the

47:00.160 --> 47:03.860
issue and it's widely anticipated and Nintendo will address the issue at E3 with some type

47:03.860 --> 47:05.340
of storage device.

47:05.340 --> 47:09.940
But I don't think they're going to come out at E3 and say, Hey, just for geeks, no tacos.

47:09.940 --> 47:14.660
Well, that's so fucking lame anyways, because your average, you know, anybody that's using

47:14.660 --> 47:18.820
the Wii console needs the storage space because they didn't think it through very well.

47:18.820 --> 47:21.260
They were trying to cut costs to make this thing very, you know.

47:21.260 --> 47:24.740
Why are you bragging that there's a hundred, I'm sorry, this isn't you, this isn't Nintendo.

47:24.740 --> 47:28.580
Why are you bragging there's a hundred plus different games you can download on virtual

47:28.580 --> 47:32.100
console when your stupid thing won't even hold it, you know, more than 20?

47:32.100 --> 47:38.140
Well, one other thing though that I would like to say is that Nintendo does have a track

47:38.140 --> 47:42.580
record for creating the demand for something.

47:42.580 --> 47:47.120
And then when people are worked up enough about it, they'll release the product.

47:47.120 --> 47:51.860
So I would not be at all surprised if they didn't have something like this already in

47:51.860 --> 47:57.600
mind that they put out this massive amount of downloadable content, stuff that's going

47:57.600 --> 47:59.460
to fill up all this space.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.380
And then when people are like, what do we do, what do we do?

48:02.380 --> 48:06.140
Nintendo comes to save the day with a storage unit, you know, something like that.

48:06.140 --> 48:09.580
Hit stun says, somebody called you a geek and you're going to boycott over it.

48:09.580 --> 48:10.580
Um, sorta.

48:10.580 --> 48:11.580
Yeah.

48:11.580 --> 48:14.420
Because if I mentioned a derogatory fashion, yes, because it was meant in a derogatory

48:14.420 --> 48:15.420
fashion.

48:15.420 --> 48:18.740
And if we've been supporting the company for all this years and this is the thanks we get,

48:18.740 --> 48:20.420
then I'm not going to support it anymore.

48:20.420 --> 48:22.980
Well, that's, that's the issue.

48:22.980 --> 48:27.500
Online plays for geeks and a tacos.

48:27.500 --> 48:28.500
I don't know.

48:28.500 --> 48:29.500
Yeah.

48:29.500 --> 48:34.220
Avatars are for non-friend codes are for geeks and tacos.

48:34.220 --> 48:35.220
Geeks and tacos.

48:35.220 --> 48:36.220
No.

48:36.220 --> 48:37.220
Oh, tacos.

48:37.220 --> 48:40.660
If he said download things were for tacos, I would be, yeah.

48:40.660 --> 48:41.660
Tacos are rad.

48:41.660 --> 48:42.660
Okay.

48:42.660 --> 48:47.300
Um, I'm going to, I'm going to give a GameStop gift certificate to anyone who comes over

48:47.300 --> 48:52.260
here and brings us chicken, soft tacos.

48:52.260 --> 48:53.260
Nobody knows where we live.

48:53.260 --> 48:54.260
Some people do.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.260
I live.

48:55.260 --> 48:56.260
All right.

48:56.260 --> 48:57.980
Look, I'm, I'm done with my rant.

48:57.980 --> 48:59.260
I'm sure we'll get emails on it.

48:59.260 --> 49:00.660
Let's go on to the next story.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.000
Oh yeah.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
We have that.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Don't we?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Yes.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.780
Um, for, uh, people who are going to be downloading this stuff who may or may not be participating,

49:09.780 --> 49:14.880
but only in the UK, we have, um, five new games out in virtual console.

49:14.880 --> 49:20.020
We have, um, Alex Kidd Miracle World, which is a good, good game.

49:20.020 --> 49:24.900
Um, and that is actually going to be 500 Wii points.

49:24.900 --> 49:30.660
There is, um, Last Ninja and Nebulas for Commodore 64.

49:30.660 --> 49:34.620
And, um, both of those are 500 Wii points.

49:34.620 --> 49:37.780
And then for Neo Geo, we have Ninja Combat and Fatal Fury 2.

49:37.780 --> 49:41.760
And those are going to be 900 Wii points.

49:41.760 --> 49:42.980
Guess what, Rob?

49:42.980 --> 49:48.140
You can actually come over to my house and play Fatal Fury 2 on my Neo Geo.

49:48.140 --> 49:49.140
I'll do that.

49:49.140 --> 49:50.140
Do you want to?

49:50.140 --> 49:51.140
Yeah.

49:51.140 --> 49:52.140
Okay.

49:52.140 --> 49:53.940
Cause I think those Neo Geo cartridges have more storage than a Nintendo Wii.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.780
512 megabytes.

49:55.780 --> 50:00.180
So yeah, there's the same amount of storage in one of those fucking carts than there is

50:00.180 --> 50:01.180
in the Nintendo Wii.

50:01.180 --> 50:02.180
Same amount.

50:02.180 --> 50:05.940
I would say that, yeah, they're 512 a piece.

50:05.940 --> 50:08.780
I'm sorry, but flash memory is not that expensive.

50:08.780 --> 50:12.260
And I don't understand why they couldn't have added more to this.

50:12.260 --> 50:18.980
I think seeing as the device will already read a USB thing and or, or it will copy to

50:18.980 --> 50:20.260
your SD card.

50:20.260 --> 50:23.740
I don't see they could do it with a freaking patch.

50:23.740 --> 50:28.140
They could patch the system there to temporarily load things off your SD card into the flash

50:28.140 --> 50:29.140
memory.

50:29.140 --> 50:32.900
I don't know about piracy, you know, with their Wii people already pirate.

50:32.900 --> 50:33.900
Yeah, exactly.

50:33.900 --> 50:34.980
People already know how to do it.

50:34.980 --> 50:37.020
It's not going to matter anymore.

50:37.020 --> 50:41.180
So oh well.

50:41.180 --> 50:48.620
In other news, unrelated to Nintendo, Famitsu Magazine, you know, they're definitely one

50:48.620 --> 50:51.620
of the most popular gaming magazines in Japan.

50:51.620 --> 50:55.820
And if you want to get your grubby little hands on it, a subscription, it's going to

50:55.820 --> 50:57.580
cost you quite a bit of money.

50:57.580 --> 51:05.700
However, NCSX is offering import subscriptions to Famitsu Magazine, ranging anywhere and

51:05.700 --> 51:14.420
I hope you have the money for this anywhere from $480 a year to $2,860 a year $480 per

51:14.420 --> 51:20.740
year for issue or 52 issues because is a weekly magazine considering they're being shipped

51:20.740 --> 51:21.740
from Japan.

51:21.740 --> 51:22.740
That's actually not that bad.

51:22.740 --> 51:23.740
Exactly.

51:23.740 --> 51:31.820
Yeah, for media mail and UPS overnight shipping would be $2,860 because it's overnight shipping

51:31.820 --> 51:36.940
that priority mail only $626 so you can do the same thing through Amazon and have been

51:36.940 --> 51:40.940
able to for a long time because I could I had a for a little while subscription to the

51:40.940 --> 51:43.620
Doctor Who magazine nerd.

51:43.620 --> 51:48.220
So you can also geek otaku just about whatever Rob I said it big fat.

51:48.220 --> 51:51.140
So what about that but this is nothing new.

51:51.140 --> 51:54.740
I mean, they're just doing the same thing that you've been able to do for Amazon for

51:54.740 --> 51:55.740
ages and ages.

51:55.740 --> 51:58.660
So nothing wrong with a little competition.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.340
I can get prices down.

52:00.340 --> 52:04.340
I could go to Kinokuniya and buy them every week too.

52:04.340 --> 52:09.500
So all right, but but there is something you know overnighting it to your door.

52:09.500 --> 52:10.980
That is kind of neat.

52:10.980 --> 52:17.220
But yeah, I guess Amazon huh a week later and every so often Kinokuniya will clear them

52:17.220 --> 52:19.780
out, you know, a couple weeks after that for half price.

52:19.780 --> 52:25.340
Well, hopefully something something coming to your door soon will be Mega Man 9.

52:25.340 --> 52:31.980
If this is to be believed Capcom apparently is recently registered Mega Man 9 under Australia's

52:31.980 --> 52:33.480
version of the ESRB.

52:33.480 --> 52:38.340
That would be the Office of Film and Literature Classification the OFLC.

52:38.340 --> 52:41.720
Apparently the game is going to be multi platform.

52:41.720 --> 52:45.460
So that could be pretty interesting especially when you consider a couple weeks ago didn't

52:45.460 --> 52:49.340
Capcom say something about reviving one of their dead franchises or there was going to

52:49.340 --> 52:50.340
be a couple.

52:50.340 --> 52:51.340
Yeah.

52:51.340 --> 52:54.780
And Mega Man 9 would be the revival of a pretty dormant franchise.

52:54.780 --> 52:59.220
I mean if you take out Battle Network and you know X and all that other stuff we haven't

52:59.220 --> 53:01.380
seen a Mega Man game since the PS1.

53:01.380 --> 53:03.900
So that would certainly be a welcome surprise I think.

53:03.900 --> 53:05.780
I certainly would love to see a Mega Man 9.

53:05.780 --> 53:10.060
I hope it has the cheesy anime sequences that Mega Man 8 had.

53:10.060 --> 53:11.060
You know what I want to see?

53:11.060 --> 53:12.060
Huh?

53:12.060 --> 53:21.020
I want to see a redo of Mega Man 2 with the higher end graphics I think as long as it

53:21.020 --> 53:22.020
plays the same way.

53:22.020 --> 53:24.780
Well there was sort of that thing on GameCube the anniversary condition.

53:24.780 --> 53:28.420
Yeah but I want shiny.

53:28.420 --> 53:32.900
Here's what I would like to see the Mega Man otaku geek in me would like to see.

53:32.900 --> 53:37.260
I would like to see them kind of do that like what you're saying but have the first three

53:37.260 --> 53:43.200
Mega Man games all combined where you could go into the different stages like let's say

53:43.200 --> 53:47.940
you could go play in Bubble Man's stage and then go to Top Man's stage and then to Cuts

53:47.940 --> 53:50.180
Man's stage and you could kind of like all of them combined.

53:50.180 --> 53:52.380
We need a new Rocket Man the power battles.

53:52.380 --> 53:54.220
That would be kind of cool.

53:54.220 --> 53:55.220
That would be hot.

53:55.220 --> 53:58.620
AJ Mix calls it Mega Man 2 HD Remix.

53:58.620 --> 53:59.620
Why not?

53:59.620 --> 54:00.620
Put it on Xbox 360.

54:00.620 --> 54:01.620
Exactly.

54:01.620 --> 54:02.620
Why not?

54:02.620 --> 54:03.620
Sounds like fun.

54:03.620 --> 54:04.620
Alright.

54:04.620 --> 54:10.740
You know what we should download extra stuff on Xbox 360 and put that include that in our

54:10.740 --> 54:11.740
letter.

54:11.740 --> 54:17.620
I already download a lot on Xbox 360 there's really that's really nothing new so I have

54:17.620 --> 54:21.740
that thing set to automatically download all demos which was a pretty brilliant idea but

54:21.740 --> 54:24.780
Xbox can do that because the hard drives are huge they're 20 gigs.

54:24.780 --> 54:26.260
I've yet to film it.

54:26.260 --> 54:29.820
And if you need more space there is a 120 gig hard drive available.

54:29.820 --> 54:31.660
Exactly that 20 gigs has been more than enough.

54:31.660 --> 54:32.660
And if you're industrious.

54:32.660 --> 54:35.540
Especially especially after I deleted Final Fantasy 11.

54:35.540 --> 54:39.540
It's been more than enough space because I don't really watch movies on it but if I did

54:39.540 --> 54:45.100
I could go get that 120 or you know they have the you can put stuff on USB memory card da

54:45.100 --> 54:47.740
da da da da da da.

54:47.740 --> 54:51.860
Act Def calls it kind of like the Sonic 2 HD version some guys are doing.

54:51.860 --> 54:53.180
Well kind of.

54:53.180 --> 54:56.620
Alpha Cannongram says Sky Mega Man anniversary collection for GameCube sucks.

54:56.620 --> 55:00.620
Oh yeah I forgot there's a whole GameCube versus PS2 even though the GameCube had the

55:00.620 --> 55:03.820
remix music it screwed with the buttons and all that.

55:03.820 --> 55:05.100
All right fine whatever.

55:05.100 --> 55:06.500
You know what I meant.

55:06.500 --> 55:08.500
I'm still excited about Mega Man 9.

55:08.500 --> 55:11.100
Well that is actually pretty cool.

55:11.100 --> 55:12.100
You know.

55:12.100 --> 55:17.820
But for our people who like their video games turned into movies like me as long as they're

55:17.820 --> 55:20.780
not fucked up.

55:20.780 --> 55:26.900
There is some news about Onimusha and Clock Tower movies and actually the Clock Tower

55:26.900 --> 55:31.060
movie still has Christoph Ganz still attached to it.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.420
So that's pretty cool.

55:32.420 --> 55:34.780
That's cool because I like Silent Hill.

55:34.780 --> 55:36.220
I for one liked it.

55:36.220 --> 55:44.340
And that one's got a I'm trying well I think actually that and Onimusha are set to come

55:44.340 --> 55:45.340
out 2011.

55:45.340 --> 55:46.340
So.

55:46.340 --> 55:48.740
Actually no I take that back.

55:48.740 --> 55:54.300
Onimusha is going to be out I'm not Onimusha will be out in 2011 and Clock Tower will be

55:54.300 --> 56:00.780
out next year possibly but it better not suck.

56:00.780 --> 56:01.780
Go camp out now.

56:01.780 --> 56:02.780
You know what.

56:02.780 --> 56:03.780
You know what Rob.

56:03.780 --> 56:04.780
What.

56:04.780 --> 56:07.620
We need a Fatal Frame movie.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.900
I still want to see the Silent Hill 2 movie get made.

56:09.900 --> 56:10.900
Yes I know.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.100
I thought they were making a Fatal Frame movie.

56:13.100 --> 56:14.100
Are they?

56:14.100 --> 56:15.100
I thought.

56:15.100 --> 56:16.100
I don't know.

56:16.100 --> 56:17.100
That'd be cool.

56:17.100 --> 56:18.100
We'll see.

56:18.100 --> 56:19.100
Me too.

56:19.100 --> 56:27.260
So we got a lot of stuff coming out this week in game releases in the U.S. on PC.

56:27.260 --> 56:29.260
Political Machines 2008.

56:29.260 --> 56:36.940
Yes you too can now take part of your own I don't know political election.

56:36.940 --> 56:45.220
Also this week we've got the Spore Creature Creator for PC if you want to you know have

56:45.220 --> 56:48.420
a little piece of spore to play until the actual game comes out.

56:48.420 --> 56:51.220
Although apparently if you know where to look you can already get it.

56:51.220 --> 56:52.220
That's the demo.

56:52.220 --> 56:53.420
And I hear it's quite good.

56:53.420 --> 56:54.420
That's the demo.

56:54.420 --> 56:55.420
Oh.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.420
Still.

56:56.420 --> 56:57.420
I hear it's quite good.

56:57.420 --> 56:58.420
Yes.

56:58.420 --> 57:00.520
I haven't played it myself but I hear it's good.

57:00.520 --> 57:06.900
Also this week Space Invaders Extreme on the PSP and DS definitely worth checking out.

57:06.900 --> 57:08.100
Finally.

57:08.100 --> 57:14.620
Imagine Rockstar on the DS not quite as cool as Imagine Babies but whatever.

57:14.620 --> 57:16.460
Imagine Babies is still in my backpack.

57:16.460 --> 57:18.260
Special in its own way.

57:18.260 --> 57:21.020
Wacky Races Crash and Dash.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.020
Yes.

57:22.020 --> 57:25.580
That's based off of that really old cartoon series.

57:25.580 --> 57:26.740
Does anyone still remember it?

57:26.740 --> 57:27.740
I don't know.

57:27.740 --> 57:28.740
No.

57:28.740 --> 57:33.900
Code Lyoko, Fall of Izana is coming on the DS.

57:33.900 --> 57:37.340
Secret Agent Clank on the PSP.

57:37.340 --> 57:40.100
Ubisoft's whoring yet another pets franchise.

57:40.100 --> 57:42.380
Pets Dogs Fashion.

57:42.380 --> 57:43.380
That's right.

57:43.380 --> 57:46.500
Dogs dressed up like things.

57:46.500 --> 57:47.940
Interesting.

57:47.940 --> 57:50.020
But not.

57:50.020 --> 57:52.900
Stop anthropomorphizing our animals.

57:52.900 --> 57:54.900
Arkanoid on the DS.

57:54.900 --> 57:55.900
That's pretty cool.

57:55.900 --> 57:59.380
Tamagotchi Connection Corner 3.

57:59.380 --> 58:05.680
We've got the Rock Band Special Edition which is coming out next Sunday on the Wii.

58:05.680 --> 58:11.500
Also Guitar Hero On Tour will be coming out on the DS as well.

58:11.500 --> 58:14.940
And I believe that's it.

58:14.940 --> 58:20.180
Probably slow week for game releases actually.

58:20.180 --> 58:22.660
Not too much more upbeat over in Japan either.

58:22.660 --> 58:26.420
It's kind of a slow period for release dates in Japan but on the Xbox 360 on June 19th

58:26.420 --> 58:31.980
you can pick up Flat Out Ultimate Carnage if you want to get that because their releases

58:31.980 --> 58:34.940
tend to be on Fridays.

58:34.940 --> 58:39.460
Over on the Playstation 3, not a lot coming out this week.

58:39.460 --> 58:41.060
Stay tuned for next week.

58:41.060 --> 58:46.020
On the Nintendo Wii you can pick up Puyo Puyo which has now been reduced in price.

58:46.020 --> 58:50.700
You can also get Super Mario Stadium Family Baseball is coming out on the 19th as well.

58:50.700 --> 58:55.180
Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian comes out in Japan, a localized version there.

58:55.180 --> 59:01.740
And Harukanaru Jiku no Kade 4 comes out from Koei on the 19th as well.

59:01.740 --> 59:06.060
Taking a look at the PS2 for those of you that still love that.

59:06.060 --> 59:11.040
Another version of Harukanaru Jiku no Kade comes out on the Playstation 2.

59:11.040 --> 59:16.140
So Love Drops and Odin Sphere get moved into the best meaning they get price drops.

59:16.140 --> 59:20.860
And Sora Yume also comes out on the Playstation 2.

59:20.860 --> 59:27.820
Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS we have Nippon Shuzan Renmei Kanshu Itsu

59:27.820 --> 59:31.500
Demosoroban DS comes out.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
Also another version of Puyo Puyo.

59:32.500 --> 59:33.980
The pronunciation is getting a lot better Rob.

59:33.980 --> 59:37.420
Since I've been doing this for a long time now it's getting slowly better.

59:37.420 --> 59:39.580
Just remember everything is either A, I, U, A, O.

59:39.580 --> 59:42.300
Okay, I'm trying.

59:42.300 --> 59:46.020
Spectral Force Genesis comes out on the Nintendo DS.

59:46.020 --> 59:49.140
And Watashi no Pony comes out.

59:49.140 --> 59:50.140
My Pony.

59:50.140 --> 59:52.860
Yes, it's like My Pony.

59:52.860 --> 59:54.380
It's not My Little Pony.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.380
Is this My Pony?

59:55.380 --> 59:59.040
It's just My Pony.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.580
But it is definitely a pony game for the DS.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.580
There's no mistake.

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.900
There's a big old pony right there on the cover.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.500
So something to look for.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:11.940
And My Health Coach Weight Management comes to all Asian regions this week as well on

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.940
the Nintendo DS.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.820
Although I'm thinking I don't know a lot of Husky Asians.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.060
I'm thinking that's a game they need to release over here a little quicker.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.180
I think it is out over here though.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:26.840
On the Sony PSP God of War Chains of Olympus comes out in Chinese.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.860
It's localized for Chinese so that's coming out this week.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.660
That's not Japan but you know Asia in general.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.840
Comes out over there.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.060
Also coming out on the Sony PSP Secret Agent Clank.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.980
Super Robot Tyson a portable.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.980
Sweet.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:43.820
There aren't enough Super Robot Wars.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.020
That's really it.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.580
Also the headset and remote come out for the PSP this week in Japan.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.660
There you have it.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.940
I want the one of those that has the Avas in it.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.940
The Robot Tyson.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:59.140
I think it was one of the Saturn ones.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.140
Very cool.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.140
Is it my turn?

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.140
It is your turn.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.140
It's in the UK.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.140
Lots of them.

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.140
Well a few of them.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.140
But on lots of systems.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:11.540
We have Alone in the Dark for Wii, PS2, PC and Xbox 360.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.660
Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 on PSP.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.660
About Time.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.380
Gauntlet on DS.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.940
I like Gauntlet.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:26.040
The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian on PSP, Xbox 360, DS, PS2, Wii PC, PS3 and Top

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.020
Spin on Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:34.020
Not to be confused with that really cool car show Top Gear.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.580
I'm looking at Justin TV chat right now which I don't usually watch during the show but

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.900
I know we have some people who can only watch on Justin TV because for whatever reason the

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.780
other ways to listen to this are banned.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:47.220
Ikuma JP who actually lives in Japan pays me a compliment and says I understand Skye's

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.460
Japanese now.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.900
That is quite the compliment actually.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.900
I never had a lesson.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:57.380
I was just saying it really is I guess with practice you know and I have noticed you picking

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.380
up a little vocabulary.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380
A little.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380
A little.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.380
A little.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380
Rob's picking up stuff.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.540
Pretty soon I'm going to start answering my phone.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.540
Moshi Moshi.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.540
Alright.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.060
Also, Ikuma JP brings up that whole difference.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.060
Is Mega Man the same thing as Rock Man?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.060
Yes.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.700
Rock Man is what it is in Japan and Europe.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.980
I don't know why they called it Mega Man here.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.740
I'm thinking that maybe they thought if they called the game Rock Man people would have

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.900
thought it was like a rock band or rock music.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.580
Well, there was the girl assistant was Roll.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580
I know.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.580
Rock and roll.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580
I know.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580
It makes perfect sense.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.420
Maybe is it because like Guts Man was kind of a rock character and they didn't want people

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.020
to think he was a bad guy.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.020
I don't know.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.020
I don't know.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.180
Because people don't get it.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.180
It's weird.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.300
They did have a lot of those changes back in the day.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.300
Random.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.580
And the really ugly cover that Mega Man 2 had.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.580
Oh my God.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.900
This is when Capcom was like let's Americanize all of the art.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.780
That was a pretty awesome cover.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.420
The only I think good one that was done was one of the Metal Gear ones that looked like

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.780
it had Michael Bayne on it.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.700
I was like dude Terminator.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.380
Akuma, you got to check that out if you've never seen it.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.620
Go to Google art and search for the Mega Man 2 box art because it's pretty epic.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.420
In fact, if you live overseas and you've never seen it, it's pretty hilarious.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.660
Prepare to weep.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.780
All right.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780
It's hideous.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.780
All right.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:19.780
Let's get back to some gaming news.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:20.780
Sorry, Loki.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.780
All right.

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.340
Well, with E3 right around the corner, of course, it's about this time of the year where

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:30.100
people start making their lists of games that have been announced to be discussed during

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.100
E3.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:37.140
IGN, of course, is one of those websites that's doing that and some interesting things have

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.180
come out of that.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.660
One thing that's popped up, there are two untitled Capcom projects that weren't shown

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.500
off at the recent Captivate event.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.340
And they're thinking Dead Rising 2 perhaps.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.700
Oh, they're so close.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.700
They're so close.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.700
Warmer.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.700
Getting warmer.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.700
You're so close.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700
You're warm.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.420
I don't know what the other one is, but we know what one of them is.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.740
Bionic Commando Rearmed.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.460
But I guess considering that E3 is coming out mid-July, it'd probably be out before

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.180
then.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:16.300
And Halo Wars was there, but Alan Wake was not.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.380
And the list is still very incomplete right now.

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:23.660
So there's, you know, no Atari, Codemasters, Crave, Disney, Eidos, Konami, LucasArts,

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:31.020
MTV, Nintendo, Sega, Sony Online, Square Enix, Take Two, Tecmo, THQ, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.380
Interactive.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:36.660
So that's a big gap right there.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.220
A big list.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:44.700
But I'm sorry, I'm reading in chat about the whole Rockman versus Mega Man thing, and GameGuru

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.880
is saying Rocks is slang for crack.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.500
So maybe that's why they didn't want to release it here, because people would have thought

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500
it was Crack Man.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.700
So I don't know, if you release a game called Crack Man, I think it might actually sell

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.420
pretty well.

01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.860
And then Dark Sakura, our very own, followed that up in chat, saying also Rocks would be

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:01.860
slang for nads.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.420
Thank you for pointing that out.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:10.660
But it was pointed out by Shauron that everything is slang for either some kind of drug or something

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.340
to do with sex, and I said that everyone likes sex and drugs.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.340
It's true.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.340
It can be.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.340
It's true.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.580
But not everybody, for real.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.060
Some people.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.860
Did you know that Pac Man overseas is called Puck Man?

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.860
Yes, I did.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.860
P-U-C-K Man.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.940
And you know why they didn't release that here?

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.460
Because they were afraid that people were going to take their magic markers and color

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:36.100
over the P with an F. I swear to God, I read it on Wikipedia, therefore it's true.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100
Rob.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.100
What?

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.100
Rob.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.100
Rob.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.100
Rob.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.100
Rob.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.100
What?

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.100
Next story.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.100
All right.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.100
Sure, we can do that.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.100
And I don't know, Jamie, this might be of interest to you.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:50.980
Have you ever wanted to have a life-size solid snake statue?

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.380
Uh, hey?

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.380
Why not?

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.260
You know, shit, we ought to get one of these for the studio.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.980
That would be kind of rad, actually.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:05:59.980
It's a fucking auction.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.980
All right.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.980
Well, here's the thing.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:08.060
What Sam's Club is doing, Sam's Club is actually selling a life-size statue of the old snake,

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.860
and it's being sold starting this upcoming week.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.760
Unfortunately, it's not something you can actually go into the store and buy.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.460
It's being auctioned.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.940
And it's actually in a Walmart blog that originally announced this called Checkout.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.540
I had no idea that there were blogs about Walmart.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:27.000
You learn new things every day.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.700
You can find it on auctions.samsclub.com, and if you search for Metal Gear Solid, you

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:37.620
can find the stand-up, which I would love to have one of here in studio, but somehow

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.620
I don't think that's going to happen.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.620
In fact, I want to see...

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:44.740
I'm going to guess that's probably going to go for a lot of money.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.580
There's only one thing I've ever won on...

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.700
Is the money going to charity or anything?

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.920
I'm sure it will be.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.180
There's only one thing I've ever won from a charity auction, and it's a fully...

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.660
I tried to search for it, and it says sold out.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.580
So what's up with that?

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.100
Maybe it doesn't start until Monday or something.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.100
Yeah.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:03.700
I've won one thing off of a charity auction for gaming-related stuff.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.700
Really?

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.700
True Crime New York City.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.460
I have a poster signed by the entire cast.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.460
Huh.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.860
It's at work, though, framed.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.980
I didn't even know that was something you were really a fan of.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:20.000
True Crime New York City, before the game actually came out and sucked, looked like

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.620
a pretty cool Grand Theft Auto game, and I like True Crime L.A., and that was kind of

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.620
fun.

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.980
So, I don't know.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.300
I bought it, and it was cool.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.660
It was the poster that they had, the little teaser poster, before they announced that

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.660
it was New York City.

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.500
You were supposed to guess, you know, what city it was.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.500
Right, right.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500
Yeah.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.420
Apparently, this auction is not up until next week, but I'll tell you what.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.620
If it's a reasonable price, I might go put a bid on it.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.620
We'll see.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.980
But I'll probably get outbid pretty quick.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.980
I think it'll be fun.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.500
Wouldn't you like to have Solid Snake sitting in the corner of the studio?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.260
Maybe Young Hot Snake.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.260
Not Old Man Snake.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.260
All right.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.260
Fine.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260
Then I won't bid on it.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.980
If you're not going to appreciate the things I do for you...

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:03.460
I'm not saying I wouldn't mind it, but now that it was, you know, if he had the camo

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.460
mask, that'd be awesome.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:06.460
We'll figure something out.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.580
I could put the Dr. Dick hat on him, the little orange hat here.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.100
I don't even know if Justin TVers can see it because it's kind of blurry, but we could

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.540
give that to Solid Snake.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.540
No.

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.540
All right.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.540
Fine.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:22.260
Well, there's something else that's sort of, uh, noteworthy as, um, rumors going around

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:26.420
that Sony was going to make any PS3 controller that would break into two parts so that you

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.060
could use, uh, use it, I guess, like a Wiimote.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.420
Um, there was actually no real clear information given about it, but what it actually turns

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:42.740
out to be, um, like I said, rumor, is that it was supposed to be a controller that has

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.180
parts that will attach to it.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:50.820
I guess, you know how the, um, 360s got the keyboard attachment on the controller and

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.660
the Mina mic and different stuff.

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.220
The little mini board.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.220
Yeah.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.220
Yeah.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.900
But this is supposed to be just sort of like stuff that will merge with the controller

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.860
and Sony hasn't confirmed or denied too much about it.

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.540
It's like Voltron in controller form.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.100
Do not associate Voltron with anything remotely Sony.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.100
By the way.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.100
Hail Jamie.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.100
By the way, Rod.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.100
What?

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.100
I thought that you might think this is funny.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.300
I downloaded the entire, um, virtual, uh, vehicle Voltron series.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.300
Nice.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.300
Cause it was awesome.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.300
All right.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.300
All right.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:33.620
Um, anyways, we've got some, uh, cool stuff coming out, uh, available for download content

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.820
this week for Rockband and Guitar Hero 3.

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:41.300
Uh, coming to Rockband, we've got Avenged Sevenfold, Offspring, and Crooked X.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:46.460
Um, there's going to be a couple of songs here, Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, which

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:52.340
is going to be 160 Microsoft points or $2, uh, Critical Acclaim by Avenged Sevenfold

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:59.300
as well for 160 Microsoft points, also $2, and, uh, Hammerhead, um, by the Offspring

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:06.780
for 160 Microsoft points, also $2, and finally, uh, Rock and Roll Dream by Crooked X for 80

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.780
Microsoft points or a dollar.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.420
So that's, uh, what you're getting for Rockband.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:19.640
Uh, coming to Guitar Hero 3, Coldplay, and new singles and a couple more tracks coming

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.360
as well, um, including, there's going to be the Coldplay Track Pack.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:29.940
It will contain Violet Hill, um, which is the first single from their, uh, Viva La Vida

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:37.340
album, uh, Yellow, and God Put a Smile on Your Face from the album A Rush of Blood to

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.340
the Head.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.740
Somehow, I just don't think you could jam to The Scientist, so, you know, they kind

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.620
of had to put these other songs on there.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.620
Yeah.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.620
At least have some guitar in them.

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:52.100
That's going to bring you 500 Microsoft points, um, or $6.25 via the PlayStation Network.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.100
Alright.

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.780
I might actually check, I like Coldplay.

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.940
They're pretty cool.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:00.620
I don't know, I don't think of myself as rocking out to them on Guitar Hero, but that could

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.620
be interesting.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:05.140
Coldplay's got some pretty guitar-heavy stuff.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:10.620
I guess that's true, but maybe I think because my favorite Coldplay stuff is their more slowed-down

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.420
stuff, like The Scientist, Fix You, I like all those really, like, slow, whiny songs.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.700
You know, that's what I like.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.700
Well, my favorite one they did is Talk.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700
Alright.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.700
Oh, that was a good song.

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.700
It was a really good song.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.700
It was my favorite one by them.

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.700
Alright.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.700
Hey, why isn't that in Guitar Hero?

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.700
That could be in Guitar Hero.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.700
It should be.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:26.700
Alright.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.660
Well, maybe, maybe in Coldplay Pack 2.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.660
Alright.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.900
Um, Rock Band 2 is going to be featuring this band.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:36.020
I have never heard of this band in my entire life.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.220
Their name is Turbo, Turbo Negro?

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.260
Is that the name of them?

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.260
I don't even know.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:45.500
This band, apparently, is going to be, I guess, is one of those cool, I mean, look at this

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.500
guy.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.460
He's wearing, like, a ginormous fur, like, train, like a bride, like a bride would wear.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.380
You know what impression I'm getting of them, Rob?

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.380
What?

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.380
Is, um.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.380
The Village People.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.380
The Village People, right.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.380
You've got a sailor, and you've got, like, the bride.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.380
I have never.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.380
You have a pimp.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.340
I have never heard of, God, I feel old.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.140
I seriously have never heard of this band.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.140
Like, I'm so out of touch with you.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.140
Rob, don't feel bad.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.140
Neither have I.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.140
Alright, good.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:10.140
However, I see bad religion, so.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.860
Well, hold on, I'll get to that for a minute.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.860
Sorry.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:13.860
Alright.

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:18.140
Here's the thing is that when Age of Conan, you know, the big MMO, apparently, they put

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:21.960
out a press release here saying that, you know, because this band, I guess, is going

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.340
to be doing the Age of Conan soundtrack.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.340
Well, guess what?

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:31.060
They're also going to be in Rock Band 2, and bad religion is also, supposedly, supposed

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.180
to be in the Rock Band sequel, even though Jamie gave that away, and I'm just kidding.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.180
Sorry.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.100
But it was in, it was, it was thanks to Twitter.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:43.540
The guitarist and songwriter from bad religion, Brett Gurewitz, said in his Twitter, he posted

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:48.800
this twit, seven meetings and four executive decisions later, back at Sound City, putting

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.220
the finishing touches on Sorrow for Rock Band 2.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.100
I'm surprised he was able to post that with Twitter being down as much as he can.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100
Are they Nordic Death Metal?

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.100
Are they?

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.740
They'd better be Nordic Death Metal.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.740
That'd be awesome.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.740
They are from Oslo, Norway.

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.740
Woohoo!

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.340
Also, let me see if I can find them on YouTube.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.480
What's the song that's supposed to be in there?

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.620
It's Death, they're Death Punk rockers.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.620
Sweet!

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.260
I'll try to find a clip.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:16.100
And I totally agree with Acts Deaf, because bad religion's fucking awesome.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.540
They did, like, one of my favorite songs ever is by bad religion.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.220
Okay, here's a song called All of My Friends Are Dead.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:34.220
All of my friends are dead, got kicked in the head, all my friends are dead, all my

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.220
friends are dead.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.220
I'm gonna download this right now.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.220
Jamie approves.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.220
I'm downloading it.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.220
Alright, there you go.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.340
But bad religion does, did I Love My Computer?

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:46.660
That would work well with, like, a Grand Theft Auto IV video that I could possibly film.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:53.500
Because we like playing this game during lunch where we put friendly fire off and then we

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.060
fire rockets at each other so we get rocket jumped.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.500
It's kind of fun.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.380
Xenocore says it's Nordic Punk, not Death Metal.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.780
Here's that song by bad religion, by the way, in case you were wondering.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:18.020
Now, thankfully, I have heard of bad religion.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.380
Did they have an album called Apocalypse Dudes?

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:23.180
That's great.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:29.900
By the way, Dragon Force supposedly has a new album out in August, so keep an eye out

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:30.900
for that.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.900
Alright, there you go.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:36.540
That's a rock band update, or the segment where the old hosts of OLR learn about new

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.940
bands that kids are into.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.940
I just downloaded it.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.940
Alright, cool.

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:40.940
That song that you played.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.940
Alright.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.820
And I Love My Computer is great, so shut up.

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.820
So anyway.

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.020
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.860
You downloaded that on your iPhone, didn't you?

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.860
Just now.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.060
I have to ask, what did you think about the iPhone announcements on Monday, about the

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.580
new sleeker, cheaper one?

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.260
I don't care.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:04.020
I don't, I didn't want a GPS, and I already have an 8 gigabyte iPhone, and I can just

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:07.260
update my OS on it, so I don't care.

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.260
I'm gonna get one.

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.260
I want one.

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:13.020
I mean, I already wanted an iPhone, and that just kinda upped the ante a little bit.

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.620
Here's the, and then, ah, I have to ask, kids.

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:18.620
Loki, what did you think of the iPhone announcements that happened on Monday?

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:22.620
I didn't really care, because it said, well, the slim thing, it's slim around the edges,

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:25.660
but it's actually thicker.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.920
And apparently, it's gonna have that new finish on the outside, either white or black, which

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.840
is supposed to be really easy to scratch, instead of, you know, how they already had

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.520
it perfect, where you didn't, you know, it wouldn't scratch that easy.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.020
And also, there's supposed to be a bunch of hidden fees.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.020
Awesome!

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.720
Sounds like a phone for me.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.140
Really expensive, and filled with fees.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.340
See, that was the, that was the other thing, is that if they're gonna be cutting costs

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.660
in one way, they're gonna try to get it from you another way.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.500
It's, they upped the price of the plan, is what they did, or something like that.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:59.780
So I'm sitting here with my, you know, I paid $400 for my iPhone, sure, but this thing has

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:05.940
fucking lasted me, and it's fallen from my pocket, and landed on the floor, and lived.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:09.980
Although it's been in its nice, sturdy case, I got for it, too.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:14.380
And it enables me to listen to bullshit at work, because I can't watch it, but I put

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.740
my thing over it and listened to episodes of Penn & Teller's Bullshit.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.820
And so I kept up with American Idol, and hi, David Cook won!

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:27.100
Alright, uh, Joshie16 comments on the last story, saying, you know Skye, cool kids listen

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.300
to Ashlee Simpson, so you should, too.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.100
Huh, now look, I'm not that old, I know no one listens to Ashlee Simpson, okay?

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.700
I'll tell you what was cool with her.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:35.700
What?

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.700
Her interview on the Charlotte Church show.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.260
I've gotten to be where I like that show.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:43.340
I still can't get over that Charlotte Church had like a hip talk show overseas.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.780
It's funny!

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.820
I know, she's fucking Charlotte Church!

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.820
But she's hilarious!

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:52.260
She's the 11 year old girl that sang wah wah wah wah wah wah wah!

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:56.660
She's freaking hilarious, no you should watch the, okay, Rob Rob Rob, watch the, go on YouTube

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.140
later and watch the interview.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.800
I've seen, I've seen clips of the Charlotte Church show.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.780
Did you watch the interview with John Barrowman?

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.780
No.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:03.780
Watch that!

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.780
Okay, I will.

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:08.700
It is seriously, it's seriously, you know, a boy and his hag.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.360
I mean that's, that's the whole conversation.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.180
The whole, that's their whole conversation.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.180
Okay.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.180
It's the best.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.580
Is that show still, are they still producing it overnight?

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:21.980
No, she went on, she put it on hiatus after she had her baby, but was talking about bringing

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:22.980
it back up.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:23.980
Huh.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.020
Because apparently she had a blast doing it.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.020
And um.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.020
But I just, I can't get over that.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.020
She had, what's your name, who did Big Brother?

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.020
That little sweet 11 year old girl singing opera.

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.020
Big Brother UK as well.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020
All right.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.020
What was your name?

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.020
Davina?

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.020
Um.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.020
Yeah, the host, Davina or whatever it is.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.020
Yeah.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.020
She was on there.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.020
That was a really good interview too.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:41.940
But, and the Ashley Simpson one was great, but the Gwen Stefani one was great.

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940
All right.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.960
And she wanted to get, um, I have to say this.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.940
I was reading an interview where she wanted to get Paris Hilton on the show so she could

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.940
make fun of her.

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940
All right.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.340
So, oh, that'd be funny.

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340
We've gone, let's see.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.340
What have we talked about tonight?

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.460
We talked about D and D. We talked about international TV.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.460
You know something is wrong with OLR when we're talking about Charlotte Church's life.

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:04.460
But her show's funny.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.460
All right.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.460
Talk about video games, Jamie.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:07.460
Uh-uh.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.460
Yes.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.460
The agency.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.460
Yes.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.460
There we go.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.460
Warmer.

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:16.420
It is not going to have the thing, the word that I hate that I will not use.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:21.120
It is not going to have the arbitrary transactions that occur within the game that some people

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.100
have used the term micro as a prefix to.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.100
How's that?

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.100
Micro machines.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.540
Shut up.

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:35.260
They are not going to be using an arbitrary transition system within the agency.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:39.840
They are actually going to have an in game currency that you will use like, um, a lot

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.700
of MMOs have, you know, in an auction house.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:46.640
Oh, like a microtransaction.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:53.160
You will not be using actual currency to purchase your money in game.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.680
You will be using the in game currency that you use, much like buying your weapons in

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:05.580
Metal Gear Solid 4, which is not an arbitrary transaction because it's no money out of your

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.580
pocket.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.580
The micro machine man here, aircraft carrier there, he can't have that, he can't have this.

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.580
He died.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.580
The new micro machine aircraft carrier playset.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.780
The dramatically detailed, terrifically trimmed replica of the real thing that holds 25 micro

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:16.140
machines with fabulous, fantastic features, two totally terrific elevators, real working

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.380
hoist runway and two cargo arms.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.940
The new micro machine aircraft carrier playset from Galoob.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.420
Remember, if it doesn't say micro machines, it's not the real thing.

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:27.100
It's because, you know, he figured out that, you know, in your life you can only say so

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:33.180
many words before you die and well, you know, he just blew through those really quick.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.180
You are horrible.

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.560
You know what though?

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.460
He was actually, I very, very much like him though because he was also Blur in Transformers

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.460
the movie.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.460
He was also the Scatman.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.460
Wasn't that the same guy?

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460
No.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460
No.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.460
Oh.

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.460
I thought it was the same guy.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460
No.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.660
I always thought Scatman and the micro machines guy were the same fucking guy.

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.060
However, Scatman Cruthers was Hong Kong Phooey.

01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.060
Well they did both die.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.060
I know.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.060
That's sad.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.060
It is sad.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.060
Maybe Loki's on to something.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.060
As I was saying.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.060
Alright, sorry.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:08.260
We're screwed too then.

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:15.420
The live gamer system is going to be used basically, you know, to set up like it is

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:21.100
in EverQuest 2 where they use a golden game as a transaction but they said that they were

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:29.460
planning on using an, I quote, alternate mechanics to use outside of in-game play for, like,

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:34.300
I guess for purchasing things that go along with it but not necessarily as an integral

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.300
part of the game play.

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:40.180
Like if you're going to call you on your cell phone and shit too in this game, like to tell

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:47.020
you, hey, Bub's, you know, been kidnapped, do you want to, you know, do you want to pay

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.020
the ransom?

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.020
No.

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.460
And you're like, fucking stop calling me at work.

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.700
I'm not playing you anymore.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.140
I don't know.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.140
Ah, technology.

01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.140
God, I love it.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.140
It's...

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.140
It's...

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.140
Speaking of technology though.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.140
Whatever.

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.140
Not you.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.140
Not you.

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.140
Rob.

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.140
Um...

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.140
What?

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:14.500
No, Rob just looks over here and he has this amused expression and I'm like, whatever.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.500
Cause I'm funny.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.980
You are a fun guy like a fungus, ho ho ho ho.

01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:21.980
Next story.

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.980
Anyways.

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:28.860
So speaking of technology, Capcom is offering fans of the Street Fighter series to get their

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.220
face into the game.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:38.940
And according to Capcom's Unity blog, they posted a call for fans to submit their story

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.760
and why they should be in Street Fighter IV.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.700
You can send them anything from a new belly dancing telegram to, you know, something a

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.700
little bit more elaborate.

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.620
Just, you have to send it by June 18th.

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620
And um...

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.620
Better get started.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.620
Yes.

01:21:54.620 --> 01:22:03.740
You email your submissions to contest at capcom dot com and along with your name, phone number,

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.020
age and email address.

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.060
Loki, are you going to get your face in Street Fighter IV?

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.060
I don't really care.

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.060
I think you should.

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.060
No.

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.460
Will someone else send in Loki's face?

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.460
Say it's theirs?

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.140
That's what I'd like to see happen.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:20.540
Whenever these companies have these contests for get your face in the game, I want to see

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:23.420
people just send in Loki's picture.

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:28.780
I know which picture they'll send, and that's not going to work.

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:31.020
I don't think so.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.740
I will sue them.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.300
Here's another game I'd like to see Loki in.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.220
It's Rose and Camellia.

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.460
Have you ever heard of this game?

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.540
Yes, it's the Slap-A-Woman game.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.540
I don't know if you've seen this.

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.920
It's not domestic violence or any of that, you know, stuff that's not cool.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:54.580
This is that old, like, you know, ladies in big, floofy dresses taking their white gloves

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:57.740
off and slapping the other woman in a dramatic soap opera fashion.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.460
You might have remembered this game from a couple months ago.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:01.460
There was a Flash game.

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.460
Well, guess what?

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.060
They also have it on the DS via homebrew, too.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.060
That's awesome.

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.340
There is a brand new sequel to Rose and Camellia.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.540
It's Rose and Camellia 2.

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:17.020
All new women to slap, all new stages.

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:20.420
It's just all the things you loved about the first game, but more.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.500
By the way, I have to retract my statement.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.140
John Maschida Jr. isn't dead.

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:28.260
Oh, the guy who did the microtransactions.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.940
So you must have thought he was Skep Man John, too, subconsciously.

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:31.940
No, Skep McRothers.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:32.940
Whatever.

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:35.400
There's someone else that, whatever.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.980
That's right.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.820
We were dead.

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:39.820
That's okay.

01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.820
Sauron is great.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:43.140
People report that celebrities are dead all the time.

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:45.540
Anyhow, here's the thing though.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:48.260
You cannot just get the sequel that easy.

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:56.100
You have to actually beat the original Rose and Camellia to get the sequel.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.880
But I don't think the first game was that hard, from what I remember.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.380
But it's there.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.560
All right.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.560
Let's get to it.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.420
Boys, part A has ran really long tonight, thanks to our last minute news.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.420
That's all right.

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:11.060
We've talked about a lot of stuff, but we have to take a minute to respect our elders

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:16.420
a little bit and take a trip down the halls of gaming infamy in a little segment we call

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.460
the Classic Game of the Week.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:23.220
Our very own Dark Sakura takes a look at the archives of games and finds something that

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:24.660
you all should be playing right now.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.100
Dark Sakura, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:31.140
I went for obscure, as in obscure system.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.660
It's a game that came out on the 32X.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.220
Haven't done 32X games before?

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:37.980
I don't think we've had a 32X game yet.

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.020
I think I might have done, um, I haven't done Space Harrier, have I?

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.020
Not to my knowledge.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.380
But I'm not doing Space Harrier today.

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.420
I am doing Knuckles Chaotix.

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.220
Knuckles Chaotix is cool.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.860
Cue that beautiful bean footage.

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:52.860
I'm trying.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:53.860
It's going to take me a minute.

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:57.420
The YouTubey is buffering, so tell us a little bit about Knuckles Chaotix.

01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.580
Knuckles Chaotix in Japan was called just Chaotix, and it does feature Knuckles and

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:09.380
a bunch of his buddies, um, hanging out, um, on a, uh, different island, and Knuckles is,

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.380
whoa.

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.380
Sorry.

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.380
Anyway.

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:17.580
Um, but basically, you actually have different buddies that go along with you.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:21.780
It's a, it's a buddy system game where you're joined by rings, and a band joins the rings

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.780
together.

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:29.620
So, like, say that you are using Knuckles as your main guy, then Knuckles will be able

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.220
to climb up walls and, and float across.

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:40.820
Um, you can actually use, um, I think that Espio does, like, some type of drill move

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:45.100
or something, but the whole point of the game is to use a buddy system to make it through

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.700
the five different worlds in the game.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.700
They're called attractions.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:54.140
And, you know, get to the end and, you know, kick, you know, Mecha Sonic's ass and tell

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.540
Eggman he can piss off.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:02.300
Um, some of the characters in the game actually, um, did make it into Sonic Heroes, um, that

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:11.540
would be Espio, Vector, and, uh, Charmy, and, um, but every, but also the other thing about

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.940
this game is that it's one of the first to have, um, at least on the 32X, I think, that

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:21.580
had a battery backup on its own, um, which would save your game and you could go back

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:30.500
to it at any time, um, it's really just, and I'm sure you're watching the gameplay right

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.500
now, right?

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.460
Yeah, and to be honest, since I never had a 32X or a Sega Genesis, I mean, sure, I played

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:39.540
Sonic the Hedgehog at my friend's house, but I never really played this game, like, ever,

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:44.420
so, but it looks a lot like regular Sonic, but with a little bit of his buddy action

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.420
kind of going on.

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.980
Well, the other thing about that is that you do, um, you've also got your, uh, bonus stages

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:52.380
and special stages, um, your bonus stage, you collect 20 more rings by jumping through

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:56.500
large rings that are hidden in the level, um, you've got, uh, spiral free falls and

01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:03.420
that sort of thing, um, and you also, uh, uh, have, uh, the special stages where you're

01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:10.100
going through a, um, hexagonal, um, 3D course, and I think that the characters in this, I

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:17.900
do want to say, were, um, actually, um, rendered, um, in 3D for this game.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.380
I do want to say that they were, don't quote me on that quite yet.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:29.260
Um, also now, for the people who were into the really, really obscure, there was something

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:35.340
that came out on the Genesis emulators back in the day that was called Sonic Crackers.

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.540
Do you ever remember this, Rob?

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.940
Uh, no.

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:45.660
Sonic Crackers, um, which had also been titled the Sonic Stadium and Sonic the Hedgehog 4,

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:51.460
was a game featuring Sonic and Tails linked by rings, and the very interesting thing about

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:59.940
this is that it was pretty much officially called, um, a, uh, the prototype for Knuckles

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:05.140
Chaotix, um, proven by the fact that in one of the early Chaotix, um, builds, actually

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:10.040
the December 7th, 1994 build, the same sprites for Sonic and Tails were found, although my

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.260
personal theory is that Sonic and Tails were just used, because it's their Sonic 1 sprites,

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:18.460
were used for, um, developmental purposes, to, you know, to build the engine, and, you

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:24.080
know, there's, um, levels that actually cross over that have big similarities to levels

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:29.820
that were in, um, Chaotix, so, um, it's, it's very, very interesting, I mean, it's really,

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:33.900
you know, half the game, you get through with repeating levels and lots of deterioration

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:41.300
in the data, but, um, there's, uh, actually Amy, um, Amy Rose is in the sound test on

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:45.540
Knuckles Chaotix, and there's actually a way to, on certain copies of it, to, uh, switch

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:50.200
out, I don't remember which of the characters it is, but you can do a code that switches

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:56.980
out, um, one of the characters for Sonic, for that same, uh, sprite, um, and then there's

01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:03.060
also, um, some of the level music in here, different versions of the same music was heard

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:09.720
in, um, uh, Sonic Crackers, also, um, one of the Chaotix builds was labeled as Sonic

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:20.260
Crackers 32X, so, alright, so we've had a, looks interesting, uh, it's one of those Sonic

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.780
games I never really got the chance to play, so hopefully it'll come out, I mean, I know,

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:27.180
um, game time's been adding 32X games, maybe it's on there and I just haven't noticed it,

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.340
it might be on there, I love these stages, alright, but this is a bonus stage we're looking

01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:36.620
at right now, that's actually a special stage, the Hexagon 3D one, oh, cool, and, um, actually

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:42.540
it's something that you might think is cool is that, uh, the stage, um, set up for this

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:49.420
actually, um, made its way into Sonic Advance, something similar to this, um, I'm sorry,

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:56.340
the bonus stage one that made it into Sonic Advance. Alright, there you have it, Knuckles

01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.460
Chaotix, your classic game of the week, check it out on the Sega 32X if you actually have

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:08.900
one. I have, like, two. Can you send one to one of our listeners? Um, I'll ask. Anyhow,

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:12.020
that's gonna do it for this part A of our Orange Lounge Radio, we've been running awfully

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:14.740
long here, almost like an hour and a half into it, so we're gonna take a break, we'll

01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:20.760
be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:26.020
