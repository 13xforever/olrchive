WEBVTT

00:13.786 --> 00:18.372
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 15, 2008, does Nintendo think you are a geek?

00:18.593 --> 00:20.736
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you get your picture in Street Fighter IV?

00:21.176 --> 00:24.181
[SPEAKER_00]: And many new role-playing games get dated for the Xbox 360.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.260
[SPEAKER_05]: TechMasterLoki

00:56.061 --> 00:56.581
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Loki?

00:56.722 --> 00:57.322
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing fine.

01:13.354 --> 01:14.975
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had some changes in studio.

01:15.335 --> 01:17.035
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can see it on Justin TV.

01:17.055 --> 01:27.079
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are bitching on Justin TV because it's kind of blurry tonight because we just don't have the bandwidth right now to put out a really clear image and the way we have things hooked up as a crappy resolution.

01:27.099 --> 01:27.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Not revolution.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, JTV Revolution.

01:31.461 --> 01:32.983
[SPEAKER_05]: TV TV Revolution?

01:33.003 --> 01:33.263
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:34.024 --> 01:35.365
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like complete crap.

01:35.385 --> 01:38.408
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully you can make out that Loki finally has a real chair.

01:38.828 --> 01:42.031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this nice blue little fluffy chair thing going on.

01:42.191 --> 01:43.993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the chair that Jamie used to have.

01:44.413 --> 01:45.314
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a couch now.

01:45.334 --> 01:47.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because now there is a couch over there.

01:48.177 --> 01:50.819
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can show the people on Justin TV about the couch.

01:50.979 --> 01:51.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:52.040 --> 01:56.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you untangle yourself from the chair there.

01:58.547 --> 01:59.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they can see that.

01:59.568 --> 02:00.089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a couch.

02:02.732 --> 02:07.058
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have to fix the camera, so we better start off tonight's show with a little bit of How was your gaming week, Loki?

02:08.577 --> 02:10.018
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play a whole lot this week.

02:10.378 --> 02:12.899
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant to, but I just got distracted.

02:13.619 --> 02:20.061
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 100% complete now with Grand Theft Auto 4, so I've got the achievement and all that fun stuff.

02:20.622 --> 02:29.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I finally got my video set up at home working, so I'm recording video now of gameplay, and I can do direct feed stuff now.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.921
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:47.614 --> 02:48.375
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:13.038 --> 03:22.603
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the evil swing set does is if you drive your car up to said evil swing set and leave it there for a second, it will fling you way into the air.

03:23.123 --> 03:23.984
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hilarious.

03:25.164 --> 03:37.211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was playing around with that most of the weekend and recording video and now I've edited it down and I'm trying to put something together coherent with it and hopefully we'll see a lot more of these things.

03:37.911 --> 03:41.113
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might actually have something on our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel.

03:41.713 --> 03:41.953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we haven't had anything on there in like two years.

03:43.974 --> 03:49.678
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last thing that's on there is when you and Jamie were interviewed by the news station about Guitar Hero 1.

03:50.458 --> 03:50.898
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty old.

03:50.918 --> 03:52.720
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the last thing that's on there.

03:53.060 --> 03:53.480
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.661
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to hear we have some updates.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.241
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

03:55.981 --> 04:03.606
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a video camera too, so I'm hoping I can do some stuff as well, especially with Penny Arcade Expo around the corner, which I still need to book my flight for.

04:03.646 --> 04:05.427
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a very bad boy, but I do plan on going.

04:05.847 --> 04:06.368
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be fun.

04:06.608 --> 04:07.228
[SPEAKER_05]: And BlizzCon.

04:07.308 --> 04:08.569
[SPEAKER_05]: BlizzCon's definite as well.

04:08.849 --> 04:17.673
[SPEAKER_04]: I did pick up Blastworks this week, and I actually meant to do stuff with it, but Nellie was playing Speed Racer a lot this week.

04:18.413 --> 04:20.574
[SPEAKER_04]: She really has found a game she loves, huh?

04:21.095 --> 04:30.519
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's already bored of it, because she's gotten to a part now where it's so hard that she can't go any further, so she's kind of given up on it and going back to reading.

04:32.039 --> 04:37.182
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no, I actually have Blastworks, and I meant to do some really cool stuff with it, but...

04:38.396 --> 04:39.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Starfox ships in Blastworks

05:00.103 --> 05:01.024
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:23.960 --> 05:25.700
[SPEAKER_04]: So, definitely worth checking out.

05:25.740 --> 05:30.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you want to see that, just head on to our very archaic website at orangeloungeradio.com.

05:30.441 --> 05:31.621
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to get a new website.

05:32.061 --> 05:32.822
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, someday.

05:32.862 --> 05:33.882
[SPEAKER_05]: We really need to look into that.

05:34.342 --> 05:46.184
[SPEAKER_05]: And go to our forums, and you're going to click on the OL Army clans, and you go to the Blastworks custom data thread, and let's see.

05:46.264 --> 05:47.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's the Apollo Justice.

05:47.604 --> 05:48.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look at that.

05:48.424 --> 05:48.864
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cute.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.425
[SPEAKER_05]: The OLR billboard made by GS68.

05:51.545 --> 05:52.205
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.

05:52.745 --> 05:54.206
[SPEAKER_05]: and some more ships there that he made.

05:54.426 --> 05:54.906
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

05:55.666 --> 05:56.207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

05:57.467 --> 05:58.208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's one thing.

05:58.248 --> 06:06.231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this game is going to catch a lot of people by surprise because there's so much you can make with it and there's that online community where you can share stuff, download other things.

06:06.351 --> 06:15.015
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you get done playing the game and unlocking the four other games in it, I mean, you can practically play all new games forever.

06:15.655 --> 06:16.936
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty awesome.

06:18.206 --> 06:18.446
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Karazhan

06:35.114 --> 06:36.916
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was that, but I have been playing other games.

06:36.956 --> 06:40.218
[SPEAKER_05]: I checked out the demo for Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.

06:40.578 --> 06:49.103
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a game I've been pretty excited about because if you've listened to the show before, you know I love old school Civilization, like the very first one that was on the PCs back in the early 90s.

06:49.744 --> 06:53.346
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this game to bits, even as much as most console games.

06:53.426 --> 06:56.648
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's probably my favorite PC game of all time, certainly.

06:57.088 --> 07:00.831
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to see how it translated to console, and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed.

07:01.851 --> 07:02.232
[SPEAKER_05]: I think...

07:02.952 --> 07:07.655
[SPEAKER_05]: They took out a lot of micromanaging that made Civilization really complicated.

07:08.016 --> 07:18.523
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not to say it's bad, because playing Civilization Revolution, I also went back to go play Civilization IV, which I had skipped, because I wasn't all that big on Civilization III.

07:18.643 --> 07:20.545
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, nothing's ever going to live up to the original.

07:20.945 --> 07:28.226
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually really enjoyed Civilization 4, even though there's more of that micromanaging and you actually have to kind of manage your settlers and all that going on there.

07:28.747 --> 07:39.409
[SPEAKER_05]: But in Civilization Revolution, they've really kind of, I think, I guess streamlined a lot of it to make it more accessible to a newbie and made it just feel more like a casual gaming experience.

07:39.429 --> 07:41.189
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe that's what it is.

07:41.949 --> 07:44.850
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel weird calling Civilization a casual game because it's really not.

07:44.870 --> 07:45.290
[SPEAKER_05]: But they made it...

07:46.050 --> 07:51.233
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess a little easier but I don't want to say they dumbed it down because Civilization is a very smart game.

07:51.694 --> 07:52.234
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

07:54.255 --> 08:04.162
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that I'm not really looking forward to Civilization but Red Alert 3 is going to be coming out later this year and that might be something I have to look at.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that's coming out on consoles?

08:05.963 --> 08:08.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on the Xbox 360 and I think PC.

08:09.946 --> 08:11.327
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be pretty awesome.

08:13.088 --> 08:13.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Um

08:13.544 --> 08:14.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge Red Alert fan, though.

08:14.505 --> 08:15.145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

08:15.265 --> 08:20.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more of the PC Red Alert because I like cheating my ass off in that game.

08:20.868 --> 08:27.872
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially playing with the rules I&I files and stuff like that and adding the school bus of death and fun stuff like that.

08:28.312 --> 08:28.532
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

08:29.633 --> 08:30.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

08:31.586 --> 08:32.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, other games I played this week.

08:32.887 --> 08:40.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess there was just the Civilization 4, and then for some reason I had like a night of Atari 2600 gaming, thanks to GameTap.

08:40.149 --> 08:47.831
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back and played Kaboom, and went back and played Freeway, and all these just like crazy 2600 games that I remember from the past.

08:48.351 --> 08:50.172
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was all good.

08:51.052 --> 08:51.792
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was really it.

08:51.852 --> 08:53.073
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

08:53.113 --> 08:55.293
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember, what came out on Xbox Live Arcade this week?

08:56.013 --> 08:57.514
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this Commando this week?

08:58.434 --> 09:02.555
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I wanted to check that out, but I just never got around to that.

09:03.356 --> 09:05.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so DarkSakura is settling in.

09:05.696 --> 09:06.717
[SPEAKER_05]: She just got here.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.597
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate people.

09:08.617 --> 09:09.558
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I hate people too.

09:10.638 --> 09:11.918
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate people that get in my way.

09:13.699 --> 09:15.179
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

09:15.199 --> 09:15.980
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a good gaming week?

09:16.440 --> 09:19.441
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought Crystal Castles for the Atari 2600 today.

09:20.761 --> 09:26.403
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dragon something that's the Genesis equivalent of Devil's Crush.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.884
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't even know this game.

09:30.324 --> 09:31.225
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot the name.

09:31.325 --> 09:33.786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of... I'm sure a chatter will think of it.

09:33.826 --> 09:35.967
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orange.com if you want to join in the fun.

09:35.987 --> 09:38.268
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally found the one movie I've been looking for.

09:38.288 --> 09:44.871
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been finding it expensive, even used, and I was pissed off, but I finally found it for $10.

09:45.231 --> 09:45.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what's that?

09:46.272 --> 09:46.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypercube.

09:47.892 --> 09:48.613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

09:48.633 --> 09:49.873
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Cube 3, right?

09:49.913 --> 09:50.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Cube 2.

09:50.133 --> 09:50.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.988
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't seen it, you can come over and watch it with me because it's the awesome one.

09:55.368 --> 09:57.248
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen Cube 2 or Cube 3.

09:57.308 --> 09:58.289
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the original Cube.

09:58.549 --> 10:00.609
[SPEAKER_05]: Cube would be a pretty badass video game, wouldn't it?

10:00.669 --> 10:03.890
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to tell you, someone has made a Hypercube mod for Half-Life.

10:05.910 --> 10:06.490
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

10:06.911 --> 10:13.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Hypercube just because it has to do with weird physics.

10:14.892 --> 10:16.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that Carl Sagan talked about.

10:18.052 --> 10:22.476
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in our chat at chat.orange.com says Keystone Capers for the win.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.477
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of Atari 2600 left tonight.

10:24.717 --> 10:26.579
[SPEAKER_05]: What possessed you to go get Crystal Castles for the 2600?

10:27.139 --> 10:29.982
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at Dimple and it was there.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.344
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we bought it.

10:33.224 --> 10:33.765
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, alrighty.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.327
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost bought Season 5 of Bullshit.

10:37.113 --> 10:38.894
[SPEAKER_05]: How far can you get in Crystal Castles?

11:07.495 --> 11:09.695
[SPEAKER_03]: is sitting in a chair using his feet.

11:09.956 --> 11:10.656
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.

11:11.736 --> 11:15.277
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that is pretty amazing.

11:16.557 --> 11:17.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid computer.

11:17.737 --> 11:22.178
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're always on the cutting edge of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio playing Atari 2600 games this week.

11:22.218 --> 11:23.898
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut plenty of edges of stuff.

11:25.759 --> 11:27.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually paper cuts on the manuals.

11:28.019 --> 11:33.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we also had a good bit of Metal Gear Solid 4 being beaten twice over in my house.

11:33.801 --> 11:35.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's what the other one was.

11:35.141 --> 11:35.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogger 2.

11:36.941 --> 11:37.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

11:38.422 --> 11:39.783
[SPEAKER_05]: I think probably better left forgotten.

11:39.903 --> 11:40.263
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

11:40.283 --> 11:40.583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

11:40.603 --> 11:41.544
[SPEAKER_05]: The Frogger games weren't all bad.

11:41.564 --> 11:43.345
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to hear about... The hell with Frogger.

11:43.365 --> 11:46.347
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear about Metal Gear Solid 4 because I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner.

11:46.727 --> 11:50.729
[SPEAKER_05]: I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf live because, you know, he's on live before us over at allgames.com.

11:51.270 --> 11:54.251
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of his callers called in to just rave about the game.

11:55.292 --> 11:57.673
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I know you've been a Solid Snake fan for a while.

11:57.693 --> 11:58.114
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

11:58.294 --> 11:59.294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty epic.

11:59.715 --> 12:00.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty epic.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.896
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan hurt his fingers playing.

12:02.376 --> 12:04.097
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually got a cramp in his middle finger.

12:04.898 --> 12:05.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

12:05.318 --> 12:05.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

12:06.581 --> 12:08.683
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, my man, hardcore gamer.

12:08.743 --> 12:10.364
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure he's showing it off to everybody.

12:10.584 --> 12:11.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what I heard.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what I heard.

12:12.426 --> 12:12.666
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

12:13.186 --> 12:14.467
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been talking about it, though.

12:14.688 --> 12:19.011
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, though, it's got like the longest fucking ending in the universe.

12:19.812 --> 12:23.915
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also the biggest WTF ending in the universe, which I'm not going to say more than that.

12:24.075 --> 12:24.315
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.017
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has plenty of my man in it.

12:26.557 --> 12:28.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm like the only one that likes Raiden.

12:28.519 --> 12:28.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Raiden.

12:28.859 --> 12:28.979
[SPEAKER_05]: Raiden.

12:29.804 --> 12:56.960
[SPEAKER_03]: and on top of that it's a lot of Raiden kicking ass until he doesn't kick ass and that's not all I'm going to say about that but I have to say that I'm overall pleased with the project and give Kojima and team mad props for doing a good job I don't know if you can say this without spoiling so you can say I can't answer but does it leave the door open to Metal Gear Solid 5?

12:58.388 --> 12:59.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

12:59.549 --> 13:00.329
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

13:00.369 --> 13:01.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a dog ending?

13:02.670 --> 13:03.791
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Silent Hill, dummy.

13:03.831 --> 13:04.371
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

13:04.391 --> 13:05.132
[SPEAKER_05]: They can branch out.

13:07.593 --> 13:07.873
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

13:08.193 --> 13:14.837
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have to say that I was sitting in my little hole in the house, being the computer room.

13:15.357 --> 13:16.398
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about.

13:16.578 --> 13:16.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah.

13:17.038 --> 13:18.819
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, I hear the Snake Eater theme.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.140
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what?

13:22.061 --> 13:26.404
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have to say that for fans of the older series...

13:27.544 --> 13:40.368
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got... There's major, major nods to the old Metal Gear series, and I'm not going to tell you what they are, but it's really, really... Fucking epic.

13:40.388 --> 13:43.449
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that they do it is really cool.

13:43.729 --> 13:51.431
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't support this game in any way also, by the way, because Solid Snake in the game uses an Apple iPod.

13:52.591 --> 13:53.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shut up.

13:53.312 --> 13:54.052
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he...

13:55.333 --> 13:56.754
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there is an Apple iPod in there.

13:56.774 --> 13:57.194
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shut up.

13:57.234 --> 14:05.077
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't remember seeing any of that going on in the game because they were too busy shooting stuff and talking about love on the battlefield.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.039
[SPEAKER_05]: Love is a battlefield.

14:09.119 --> 14:16.122
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's been like this constant, you know, spiritual metaphor for... Do you know what would make Metal Gear Solid 4 better?

14:16.743 --> 14:17.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake not being old?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.623
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was a musical.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the whole... You know what my subtitle for this game has been?

14:23.966 --> 14:24.146
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

14:25.132 --> 14:32.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 4, Damn Snake You Got Old Metal Gear Solid 4, Damn Snake You Got Old

14:49.833 --> 14:55.379
[SPEAKER_05]: Careful with putting that mic there because the fan... Our studio has been rearranged, I was telling the listeners earlier.

14:55.419 --> 14:56.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Jamie gets her own couch.

14:57.001 --> 14:59.003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for her to kick her feet up one night.

15:00.224 --> 15:01.085
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work there either.

15:01.105 --> 15:02.387
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to put it next to you or something.

15:02.727 --> 15:03.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the ferret?

15:03.648 --> 15:04.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my baby?

15:05.951 --> 15:08.874
[SPEAKER_05]: Your ferret is used in our D&D game, so it's in the house.

15:08.894 --> 15:10.235
[SPEAKER_03]: You're playing D&D and not tell me?

15:12.489 --> 15:13.269
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanna come play?

15:13.309 --> 15:14.269
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I can invite you.

15:14.689 --> 15:16.030
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like level 4.

15:16.610 --> 15:17.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.510
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a level 6 wereweasel.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.051
[SPEAKER_05]: 50,000 nerd points with our listeners.

15:22.311 --> 15:23.271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the uber nerd now.

15:23.291 --> 15:24.431
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a level 6 wereweasel.

15:25.171 --> 15:25.732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a bard.

15:25.952 --> 15:26.892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a level 4 bard.

15:26.912 --> 15:27.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoonie bard?

15:28.392 --> 15:30.352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a sassy bard, not a spoonie bard.

15:30.372 --> 15:32.353
[SPEAKER_03]: My wereweasel has tasted of human before.

15:32.813 --> 15:37.994
[SPEAKER_05]: But the ferret, because somebody has a ferret familiar in the game, so we actually use the ferret as the ferret.

15:39.226 --> 15:41.907
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember Mel and Eric from the DDR days, right?

15:42.127 --> 15:42.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

15:42.387 --> 15:43.567
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I D&D with.

15:44.288 --> 15:45.588
[SPEAKER_05]: The ferret is Mel's companion.

15:46.408 --> 15:48.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will talk to peeps.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it's on Tuesday, I can't do it.

15:50.290 --> 15:50.810
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Tuesday.

15:50.870 --> 15:52.030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like weekends usually.

15:52.450 --> 15:52.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

15:52.890 --> 15:53.091
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

15:53.411 --> 15:53.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

15:54.211 --> 15:54.451
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

15:55.014 --> 15:58.577
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Valerno in chat is asking, who's breathing into their mic?

15:58.597 --> 16:01.500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fan thing, and I'm not going to do anything about it, so shut up.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fan.

16:02.741 --> 16:07.085
[SPEAKER_05]: All she has to do is put her mic down, like not on the arm, but on the, yeah, just leave it in your cleavage.

16:07.145 --> 16:07.565
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fine.

16:07.865 --> 16:11.108
[SPEAKER_05]: Or put it, just put it below the arm so the fan's not blowing on it.

16:11.168 --> 16:11.449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

16:12.729 --> 16:19.113
[SPEAKER_03]: My face is above the arm line, so I need a shield over the mic.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.755
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenocore says, Sky, you better be playing version 4 or you're lame.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.876
[SPEAKER_05]: We started playing before 4 was out, because 4 just came out.

16:25.916 --> 16:26.376
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

16:26.436 --> 16:33.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck everybody, because it's all about version 2.

16:33.420 --> 16:36.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Why you gotta bring Thacco into this?

16:37.322 --> 16:39.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, I can still calculate Thacco.

16:40.984 --> 16:41.424
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look.

16:43.564 --> 16:45.285
[SPEAKER_05]: We've really got to get back to video games.

16:45.365 --> 16:47.746
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say another quick thing about Metal Gear Solid 4.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.448
[SPEAKER_05]: I just noticed this on Dig earlier today.

16:50.488 --> 16:54.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, GameSpot has given Metal Gear Solid 4 a 10 out of 10.

16:54.871 --> 16:56.672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only the sixth game in history to do so.

16:57.432 --> 17:00.274
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this is a game that's deserving of all the praise?

17:00.294 --> 17:01.314
[SPEAKER_03]: What did Famitsu give it?

17:01.795 --> 17:02.195
[SPEAKER_05]: A 40.

17:03.516 --> 17:04.556
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's deserving?

17:04.696 --> 17:06.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust Famitsu over GameStop.

17:07.618 --> 17:10.340
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they also gave Nintendogs a 40, if I remember right.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendogs was great.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.541
[SPEAKER_05]: For five minutes.

17:13.803 --> 17:15.065
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17:28.952 --> 17:31.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Xenocore in chat says, fuck Thacco.

17:32.695 --> 17:36.419
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, Kikoman2DX says they apparently took bards out of four.

17:36.759 --> 17:38.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, fuck 4th edition if that's the case.

17:38.700 --> 17:39.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it right in its ear.

17:39.581 --> 17:39.962
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

17:40.222 --> 17:43.865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about 2nd edition and playing a freaking, uh, uh, Bladesinger.

17:44.065 --> 17:44.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

17:44.746 --> 17:45.826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about it.

17:46.467 --> 17:47.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough D&D chat.

17:47.468 --> 17:50.490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about custom spells and the flesh-to-toast spell.

17:51.171 --> 17:51.271
What?

17:51.852 --> 17:54.634
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, the best spell ever, and I have to tell everybody about this.

17:54.754 --> 17:59.917
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Derek, by the way, I know you're not listening, but congratulations for getting married last week.

18:02.278 --> 18:07.502
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a character named Blackstar who created a spell called Blackstar's Instant Chaos.

18:08.502 --> 18:15.507
[SPEAKER_03]: and so far I think we got to about five pages but it was supposed to be ten pages of a hundred effects so the spell would have a thousand effects.

18:15.867 --> 18:16.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Random.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.369
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had Jesus in our game before.

18:18.789 --> 18:20.330
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had golf umbrellas pop up.

18:20.771 --> 18:24.213
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had a Mortal Kombat machine land on a lich.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.236
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of funny things happen in this game.

18:28.556 --> 18:33.500
[SPEAKER_03]: And also one of my characters actually had a breast enlargement by accident because of the spell.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.021
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk video games now?

18:35.041 --> 18:36.602
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd share that.

18:36.882 --> 18:37.863
[SPEAKER_03]: The best spell ever.

18:39.266 --> 18:43.049
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like that, and I fully endorse that in any upcoming RPG.

19:01.496 --> 19:02.097
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Father's Day!

19:19.525 --> 19:23.606
[SPEAKER_05]: Allgames.com was hacksword earlier this week, which kind of sucks.

19:24.406 --> 19:34.749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why people keep hacking allgames.com because they are only doing good for the gaming community, but I guess some people want to hack it just because they can and like the challenge.

19:35.569 --> 19:40.191
[SPEAKER_05]: So folks are having to listen to us tonight directly through allgamesradio.com.

19:40.911 --> 19:47.893
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I hear, though, allgames.com is completely being redesigned, and there's going to be a complete new site in its place soon.

19:48.533 --> 19:51.814
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish someone would do the same for OrangeLoungeRadio.com because damn, our old site's getting old.

19:54.054 --> 20:02.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week on the show, episode number 284 is the sixth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

20:03.537 --> 20:07.358
[SPEAKER_05]: A day early for all practical sake, but it's the closest day that falls to our anniversary.

20:07.818 --> 20:09.858
[SPEAKER_05]: The very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio was June 23rd, 2002.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a suggestion now!

20:41.189 --> 20:41.729
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

21:10.518 --> 21:10.818
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

21:13.380 --> 21:13.701
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

21:13.781 --> 21:16.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, let Travis roast the hoats.

21:16.403 --> 21:17.343
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that idea.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.584
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I could take that.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.707
[SPEAKER_02]: As if he hasn't enough outside the show.

21:22.507 --> 21:25.070
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty says, but I know has any ideas.

21:25.610 --> 21:25.930
[SPEAKER_05]: Cry.

21:26.250 --> 21:26.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Make one.

21:29.073 --> 21:32.257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, look, we got a lot of gaming news to get to tonight.

21:32.317 --> 21:34.439
[SPEAKER_05]: We have late-breaking news.

21:35.140 --> 21:43.449
[SPEAKER_05]: For all practical purposes, this was a slow news week up until about two, three hours ago when I think the roof just got blown off of something.

21:43.489 --> 21:44.730
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, these are rumors.

21:45.111 --> 21:46.152
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what the hell's going on?

21:46.212 --> 21:46.993
[SPEAKER_05]: Update us on the latest.

21:47.053 --> 21:47.954
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't even on our...

21:48.434 --> 21:48.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Intela Sponce

22:02.788 --> 22:03.409
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

22:23.422 --> 22:24.202
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:39.989 --> 22:49.193
[SPEAKER_04]: But it says, avatars are digital personas available this holiday for all Xbox Live connected members and this spring for all new console owners.

22:49.794 --> 23:02.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Avatars will be used in place of the gamer picture you have today and give you a much more lifelike, animated, fully customizable persona for you to reflect who you are online.

23:02.280 --> 23:02.920
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting these.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.924
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say these are a step up from Mii's, but essentially, yeah.

23:09.084 --> 23:10.245
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Mii's second mix.

23:12.267 --> 23:12.827
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

23:13.167 --> 23:13.848
[SPEAKER_03]: Mii Club Mix?

23:14.328 --> 23:14.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

23:14.909 --> 23:15.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's see here.

23:19.753 --> 23:19.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 4

23:38.107 --> 23:39.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say that's about right.

23:39.868 --> 23:43.150
[SPEAKER_04]: And some new information about the Guitar Hero 4 guitar.

23:43.310 --> 23:53.597
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be upgraded and will feature new touch sensitive neck which will allow you to do neck slides and opens up the entire guitar neck for unbound solos.

23:54.417 --> 23:55.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Shred how you want.

23:56.318 --> 23:58.800
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of the artists that they mentioned for Guitar Hero 4.

23:59.220 --> 24:06.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, Interpol, Muse, and dozens more.

24:08.124 --> 24:09.787
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here.

24:10.128 --> 24:19.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there is some information about... Remember a while ago, Lips appeared on a press site for some Microsoft announcement or whatever?

24:19.223 --> 24:19.704
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, yes.

24:20.895 --> 24:27.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Lips is a music and singing game that's going to include 30 songs and two wireless interactive microphones.

24:27.521 --> 24:33.045
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability to use and sing your own music or download songs from an online service.

24:33.365 --> 24:35.667
[SPEAKER_04]: It's designed to have fun with your friends.

24:35.707 --> 24:39.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Lips scores you on your singing, pitch, rhythm, and tune, and overall performance.

24:39.571 --> 24:43.614
[SPEAKER_04]: The wireless mics are interactive with lights on the shaft of the microphone.

24:44.074 --> 24:44.695
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

25:02.377 --> 25:10.082
[SPEAKER_04]: The game will reduce the vocals down so that you can sing along and be heard and score on whether you're in tune or not.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.764
[SPEAKER_04]: Lyrics can be added directly into the song to sing out loud.

25:15.525 --> 25:20.308
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a new Tony Hawk game that's going to be using a motion sensing device.

25:20.948 --> 25:24.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Board Controller on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

25:24.990 --> 25:28.671
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm going to try to find this here real quick.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from chat while you're looking for that.

25:31.472 --> 25:38.634
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru said, I don't know, but people are going to be pissed.

25:38.935 --> 25:42.456
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with all these news stories coming out, did E3 just get ruined?

25:43.619 --> 25:47.581
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of their big, I think, big splashes may have gotten ruined a little bit.

25:47.922 --> 25:55.106
[SPEAKER_05]: With this whole... So, wait, we have Microsoft... Okay, they've taken the Miis and made it a little better with the whole avatars thing.

25:55.166 --> 25:55.366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

25:55.606 --> 26:03.411
[SPEAKER_05]: They've taken the whole Karaoke Revolution SingStar thing and made it a little better with this lips thing and this whole, like, you can put in any song, you get the vocals taken out.

26:03.431 --> 26:06.593
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a big freaking deal, although it probably won't work perfectly.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still kind of a neat feature that the other games don't have.

26:09.735 --> 26:09.975
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

26:10.555 --> 26:16.180
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you can do, I can do better I can do anything better than you Yes I can, yes I can Yes I can, yes I can Anything you can do

26:38.254 --> 26:39.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

26:53.809 --> 27:00.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to an intuitive board-based control scheme, it's never been easier to pull off amazing tricks and feel the sensation of skateboarding.

27:01.351 --> 27:04.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Shift your weight to turn and balance grinds.

27:04.192 --> 27:08.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick back on the tail of the board to ollie and lean into airs and pull off huge spins.

27:08.813 --> 27:17.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel the sensation of dropping the 60-foot mega ramp, bombing down the world's steepest streets, and watching Earth disappear behind your board as you launch out of a half-pipe.

27:18.356 --> 27:18.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Next gen...

27:19.696 --> 27:37.632
[SPEAKER_04]: graphics amplify the fun as you ride thrilling situations like these put down the controller step on the board and feel the sensation of going big and they say it's going to be $59.99 for the PS3 and Xbox 360 I'm guessing if it's going to come with a board it's not going to be that price anyways let's see here

27:39.534 --> 27:40.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii on your PC.

27:40.975 --> 27:45.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these games are only available on consoles today and with this new feature you would now be able to

28:01.212 --> 28:03.415
[SPEAKER_04]: They will now be available on the PC as well.

28:04.677 --> 28:05.698
[SPEAKER_04]: This is with this feature.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.021
[SPEAKER_04]: Those console games are now playable on your PC.

28:08.341 --> 28:12.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the same game controllers as the original console systems.

28:13.067 --> 28:16.672
[SPEAKER_04]: All games use regular console controllers, not your computer, keyboard, or mouse.

28:16.772 --> 28:38.466
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, see, I read an interesting theory on that whole thread that was going on on NeoGAF where, you know, this whole thing exploded, that Trioxide was a possible codename for Xbox 360, because they saw some prices in here, $49 and $299, and people were speculating that maybe $49 is the new price of, like, the controllers, and $299 is this new system SKU that a lot of folks are speculating Microsoft's going to drop on us at E3.

28:38.767 --> 28:41.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I guess it's not uncommon for Xbox to use names of, like...

28:42.469 --> 28:45.190
[SPEAKER_05]: Chemicals, because I think helium was a codename of theirs once.

28:45.450 --> 28:49.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, trioxide, let's see, that would be... Ozone?

28:50.131 --> 28:51.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, O3, no?

28:52.171 --> 28:52.431
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

28:52.631 --> 28:53.812
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

28:54.052 --> 28:55.632
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is why... Yeah, that would be ozone.

28:55.752 --> 29:00.773
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is why we're in this territory of, it's rumors, but slightly above it.

29:00.893 --> 29:03.054
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, there's gotta be some fact to this.

29:03.074 --> 29:06.955
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this company is legit... There's a lot of smoke coming from this.

29:07.195 --> 29:07.415
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

29:07.715 --> 29:08.135
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's...

29:09.195 --> 29:17.117
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably some red herrings amongst this because what these people did is they were basically sending out surveys, marketing research.

29:17.637 --> 29:31.021
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how this whole thing got blown is that if you go to one of those websites, ran this whole avatars thing because somebody sent it to them confidentially from this website that they were being asked about this whole avatars thing on a research.

29:31.281 --> 29:33.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then that link got taken and...

29:34.142 --> 29:37.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people blew it wide open and found all the other surveys that were out there, too.

29:37.665 --> 29:38.685
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how this whole thing started.

29:38.745 --> 29:44.369
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, there's some legitimacy to this underneath, but there's still a lot being drafted, too.

29:44.670 --> 29:46.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see what else we've got here.

29:47.992 --> 29:49.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Scenic Pop Culture Edition.

29:49.633 --> 29:52.415
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes perfect sense that they've already come out with a scenic game.

29:52.435 --> 29:55.918
[SPEAKER_04]: The groundwork's already there, so I can see that happening.

29:56.058 --> 29:58.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme Makeover Home Edition for the Wii and DS.

29:58.319 --> 29:58.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

30:00.215 --> 30:00.896
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that too.

30:01.036 --> 30:02.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Gossip Girl for the Wii and DS.

30:03.018 --> 30:03.318
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

30:04.959 --> 30:07.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimate Band for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

30:07.802 --> 30:12.526
[SPEAKER_04]: That, if I remember correctly, Ultimate Band, I know for the Wii, is a Buena Vista game.

30:13.627 --> 30:14.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Disney Interactive.

30:14.768 --> 30:14.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

30:15.489 --> 30:18.451
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a band game that does not use instruments.

30:18.711 --> 30:19.972
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that's already been announced.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.814
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play Hannah Montana songs to your heart's content.

30:21.834 --> 30:22.535
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, yeah.

30:23.682 --> 30:31.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Yoga, which I guess is supposed to follow along an inspirational yoga guru, instructor, matching machine, all these on-screen poses, stretches.

30:31.069 --> 30:32.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there Yoga and Wii Fit?

30:32.411 --> 30:34.713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is something else.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.976
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of yoga games out there, trust me.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.157
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them.

30:39.197 --> 30:39.818
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to sell them.

30:39.858 --> 30:40.198
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

30:40.979 --> 30:43.181
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some stuff on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, too.

30:43.721 --> 30:46.443
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of... Because this is a lot of Activision stuff on here.

30:47.764 --> 30:55.329
[SPEAKER_04]: In this new Marvel Ultimate Alliance action role-playing game, Civil War erupts, and the world's greatest heroes and villains must choose sides.

30:55.429 --> 31:04.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Select your side in the conflict and assemble your team of a roster of 20 Marvel Legends, including Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, and the Human Torch.

31:04.935 --> 31:07.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Combine your team's power, blah, blah, blah.

31:07.557 --> 31:07.917
[SPEAKER_04]: It says...

31:09.514 --> 31:10.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies

31:32.731 --> 31:35.032
[SPEAKER_03]: The Marvel Zombies series is just crazy.

31:35.372 --> 31:35.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

31:35.512 --> 31:37.593
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you have read any of them, but they're nuts.

31:37.713 --> 31:40.915
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was an Army of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies 2.

31:41.735 --> 31:45.597
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be a set in the popular Marvel Zombies comic series.

31:45.637 --> 31:51.860
[SPEAKER_04]: You assume the role of Spider-Man and must save the world from zombie menaces that threaten to destroy it.

31:52.580 --> 31:56.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Play this adventure game in an open city, free-swinging environment in a war-torn Earth.

31:56.822 --> 32:00.684
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game takes place in the year 2149 in a warped version of Earth.

32:01.404 --> 32:01.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

32:02.064 --> 32:09.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight against other Marvel heroes and villains who have already succumbed to the zombie horde, or become a zombie yourself.

32:11.427 --> 32:12.247
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.

32:12.487 --> 32:14.468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing that's probably coming out next year sometime.

32:16.028 --> 32:17.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Transformers 2.

32:18.509 --> 32:20.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably will suck, because the first one really sucked.

32:21.830 --> 32:24.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously this is something that's way far away, but...

32:25.319 --> 32:26.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Spider-Man Game Using the Balance Board

32:51.841 --> 32:55.623
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be Spider-Man's heart that keeps him going, or maybe his strength.

32:56.083 --> 32:59.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Step into Spider-Man's shoes and decide for yourself.

33:00.305 --> 33:03.166
[SPEAKER_04]: One jump, leap, stomp, and kick at a time.

33:03.286 --> 33:09.009
[SPEAKER_04]: Climb atop your Wii Fit board to control Spider-Man's acrobatic abilities like never before.

33:09.549 --> 33:13.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Lean one way or the other to send Spider-Man's story into the air.

33:13.971 --> 33:18.853
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump as high as you can to propel Spider-Man off of Manhattan's tallest rooftops.

33:19.173 --> 33:22.215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see how you could do that because they don't want you jumping on the Wii balance board.

33:23.636 --> 33:24.376
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting.

33:25.577 --> 33:25.977
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

33:27.478 --> 33:28.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

33:28.579 --> 33:32.201
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says the sequel is going to be called Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen.

33:32.702 --> 33:33.202
[SPEAKER_05]: From our chat room.

33:35.035 --> 33:36.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 5, Forza 3, Cars and Tracks

33:58.200 --> 34:14.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Key features of Forza 3 include highly detailed real world cars and track models, over 400 cars and 100 tracks, near limitless customization options for cartooning and custom artwork, a variety of online community features, highly accurate racing simulation,

34:15.336 --> 34:20.998
[SPEAKER_04]: including real-world damage, new race modes, drag, drift, oval, point-to-point racing, etc.

34:21.578 --> 34:25.520
[SPEAKER_04]: A powerful assist system to help new players get into the game quickly.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.081
[SPEAKER_04]: And... what else?

34:28.141 --> 34:34.683
[SPEAKER_04]: But all that is subject to change, obviously, because he probably thinks... Yeah, this is all stuff that's going on right now, and it says also imagine that...

34:35.403 --> 34:36.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

34:56.807 --> 35:00.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra service space for photos and videos and a free month of live.

35:01.391 --> 35:06.636
[SPEAKER_04]: And the collector's edition will also include exclusive motorsports content not found anywhere else.

35:07.257 --> 35:11.380
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says this can be anything from authentic racing gear, gloves, helmets, etc.

35:11.400 --> 35:15.524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's especially created automobile and manufactured gear, branded jackets, etc.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.666
[SPEAKER_04]: to VIP motorsport event tickets.

35:18.307 --> 35:22.650
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that sounds kind of cool, but this stuff is so early that it's probably just...

35:24.446 --> 35:28.027
[SPEAKER_04]: What they want to do, and they're also kind of getting people's opinions on this stuff.

35:28.987 --> 35:34.429
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you dig even deeper in that NeoGAF thread, people kept finding more stuff on that site.

35:34.749 --> 35:42.751
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know, I didn't read into how the security hole was opened or whatever, but... It basically, well, I saw it earlier before they took everything down.

35:42.871 --> 35:43.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's fixed now?

35:44.012 --> 35:45.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, it is fixed now.

35:45.392 --> 35:48.593
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some other stuff that was on there, too, including there's a game for...

35:50.846 --> 35:53.587
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Crucible that they had a video for.

35:54.527 --> 35:59.408
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Planet Emergency Vet was a game that was on there, you know, like the show on Animal Planet.

36:00.228 --> 36:02.368
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Nye Science Lab on the Wii.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.369
[SPEAKER_05]: No joke, Bill Nye the Science Guy finally gets a Wii game.

36:06.329 --> 36:07.849
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like one of our dream games, wasn't it?

36:07.909 --> 36:08.249
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

36:08.709 --> 36:09.210
[SPEAKER_05]: And then get this.

36:09.850 --> 36:11.450
[SPEAKER_05]: You Don't Know Jack on the Wii.

36:12.130 --> 36:12.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally.

36:13.470 --> 36:14.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally this game's coming back.

36:14.851 --> 36:15.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

36:15.611 --> 36:16.891
[SPEAKER_04]: I know two other games that haven't been...

36:18.228 --> 36:20.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell's Kitchen The Price is Right Wii and DS

36:40.073 --> 36:41.655
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't play Plinko at home.

36:41.695 --> 36:42.355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.

36:42.636 --> 36:43.096
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

36:43.116 --> 36:44.337
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not the same.

36:44.678 --> 36:45.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

36:46.039 --> 36:46.279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

36:46.719 --> 36:48.781
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a Price is Right game on Commodore 64, didn't they?

36:48.801 --> 36:50.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Years ago?

36:50.283 --> 36:51.544
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some pretty old ones.

36:52.625 --> 36:58.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seeing some other stuff on here too, and I'm sure a lot of people now are starting to make up stuff to go along with this.

36:58.110 --> 36:59.111
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

37:03.123 --> 37:04.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

37:26.833 --> 37:27.794
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very interesting.

37:27.874 --> 37:31.236
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they do have a lot of stuff up their sleeves.

37:31.636 --> 37:34.358
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said they had a few aces still up their sleeves for stuff.

37:34.558 --> 37:37.380
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, ace avatar, I don't know.

37:38.001 --> 37:40.683
[SPEAKER_05]: SG100Matt says in chat, Price is right for the Wii.

37:41.003 --> 37:43.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Itagaki better do it so he get the bouncy titties.

37:44.626 --> 37:47.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know that's why people watch the Price is Right.

37:47.107 --> 37:47.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

37:47.848 --> 37:48.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on down!

37:48.909 --> 37:50.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonga bonga bonga bonga.

37:50.430 --> 37:51.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad it's all grandma's.

37:54.378 --> 38:05.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we were saying back last week, how Itagari would do, how I appear he would do a press event or kicking over stuff, setting things on fire, that kind of thing.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.583
[SPEAKER_04]: That would apply to Price is Right, too.

38:07.603 --> 38:08.624
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be pretty awesome.

38:08.704 --> 38:09.104
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be.

38:09.144 --> 38:10.785
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making a Price is Right game, bitch!

38:11.636 --> 38:11.896
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

38:13.737 --> 38:14.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely lots more to come.

38:14.997 --> 38:17.999
[SPEAKER_05]: That story, of course, all still in development, was very new.

38:18.719 --> 38:20.180
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how this develops throughout the week.

38:20.280 --> 38:26.282
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, let's get into the news we were going to talk about anyway tonight, even though that took like 20 minutes to cover, but that's pretty big.

38:26.963 --> 38:30.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's quickly run through some of the other week's news and let you guys comment.

38:30.664 --> 38:31.004
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

38:31.224 --> 38:33.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Ossifer says, Microsoft's comment.

38:33.525 --> 38:34.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, you didn't just hear that.

38:38.980 --> 38:49.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Nintendo is suing Nyko over the Comma Wireless Nunchuck, which doesn't really make much sense to me when I think about it because, you know, people put out third-party accessories all the time.

38:50.049 --> 38:55.774
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Nintendo's just really super anal about people putting out, you know, third-party remotes and nunchucks.

38:56.094 --> 39:00.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Because actually, if you think about it, I remember Mad Catz was putting out a third-party remote that kind of looked like

39:01.298 --> 39:04.439
[SPEAKER_04]: A dildo, but actually that's never come out yet.

39:04.999 --> 39:09.400
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if these people are just getting blocked by Nintendo for this stuff.

39:09.500 --> 39:22.104
[SPEAKER_04]: But either way, they are suing them because apparently it appropriates the novel shape, design, overall appearance, and even the color and materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuck controller.

39:22.944 --> 39:29.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's also wireless, but apparently it's similar enough and people are thinking, hey, maybe Nintendo's making their own wireless Nunchuck.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.504
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt that, but... I don't know.

39:33.944 --> 39:34.624
[SPEAKER_04]: It still sucks.

39:35.005 --> 39:40.268
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you're looking to buy a wireless nunchuck, do it now, before they're pulled from shelves.

39:40.288 --> 39:42.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this has any merit on Nintendo's part?

39:43.029 --> 39:46.551
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just weird, because there's tons of third-party controllers out there.

39:46.592 --> 39:47.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Why this one?

39:47.612 --> 39:48.833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true that, you know...

39:49.333 --> 39:55.156
[SPEAKER_04]: They have... It has merit, but at the same time, though, I thought that this stuff has to be approved through Nintendo first.

39:55.216 --> 39:59.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, before they make these peripherals, they have to approve it with Nintendo.

40:00.078 --> 40:03.139
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because the same could be said with these, like, you know, the Wii Zapper.

40:03.219 --> 40:08.461
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a bunch of things that came out before the Wii Zapper that were pretty much exactly the same as the Wii Zapper.

40:09.041 --> 40:15.124
[SPEAKER_04]: And some things, in fact, you know, Naiko even made a better, you know, peripheral than the Wii Zapper for gun games, but...

40:16.508 --> 40:18.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

40:40.458 --> 40:45.922
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have been some sort of process where they have to get approval from Nintendo to put out these products.

40:46.422 --> 40:47.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I don't know.

40:48.503 --> 40:49.864
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually that's the way it works, I thought.

40:52.186 --> 40:53.687
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we'll see what happens.

40:53.887 --> 40:57.969
[SPEAKER_05]: If they get the pants sued off of them or what will happen.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.711
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you think Nintendo just wants to put out a wireless thing of their own?

41:00.931 --> 41:01.532
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what's going on?

41:01.952 --> 41:02.332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

41:03.153 --> 41:05.294
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what do you think of this whole lawsuit stuff?

41:06.595 --> 41:09.897
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just Nintendo trying to keep the market under their control.

41:10.970 --> 41:16.918
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Nintendo did this this week, and it's not Nintendo as a company, but one person at Nintendo.

41:16.978 --> 41:21.084
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you hire a person like this as your marketing director, he's speaking on behalf of your company.

41:21.624 --> 41:23.226
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy pissed me off this week.

41:23.266 --> 41:24.007
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you guys.

41:24.829 --> 41:25.249
[SPEAKER_05]: This was...

41:26.090 --> 41:27.351
[SPEAKER_05]: and Edge Magazine.

41:27.692 --> 41:39.502
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo of Europe marketing director, Laurent Fischer, was talking about the whole... He got, of course, as most Nintendo people have, got kind of put on the spot lately while he was talking about WiiWare games.

41:39.942 --> 41:41.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the extra storage?

41:42.945 --> 41:47.129
[SPEAKER_05]: What about all these people that are filling up their Wii consoles with all this stuff?

41:47.189 --> 41:48.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the extra storage?

41:48.690 --> 41:50.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, according to Laurent Fischer...

41:51.374 --> 41:55.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Only geeks and otaku want the issue addressed.

41:55.658 --> 41:57.979
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the actual quote from the magazine here.

41:58.280 --> 42:01.402
[SPEAKER_05]: You can read their little site online at next-gen.biz.

42:01.702 --> 42:11.170
[SPEAKER_05]: When a question about the limited Wii system memory was raised, Nintendo's Laurent Fischer slipped into talking about how geeks and otaku were the only people who would want this issue addressed.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be their entire fan base.

42:15.894 --> 42:16.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Duck.

42:18.021 --> 42:20.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he went and tried to backtrack a little later.

42:20.422 --> 42:21.983
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking to Video Gaming 24-7.

42:22.023 --> 42:26.464
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't mean to offend anyone and it's all a misunderstanding.

42:27.625 --> 42:28.125
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

42:28.585 --> 42:36.188
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much more cut and dried that could be or how that could be misconstrued to mean anything else.

42:36.328 --> 42:46.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek and otaku, first of all, apart from being slightly synonymous except with otaku having a slight bigger social stigma overseas, is still...

42:49.190 --> 42:51.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Your freaking marketing director?

42:52.332 --> 42:54.133
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to appeal to these people.

42:54.153 --> 43:04.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know Nintendo was trying to get the broader audience and trying to get the moms and grandmoms into it, but still, their core fan base is the nerdy gamer.

43:04.579 --> 43:04.899
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

43:05.748 --> 43:27.458
[SPEAKER_05]: and here's the problem, this particular geek has spent lots of money on these virtual console downloads downloading the same shit I played years ago when I could be playing them for free on the internet but no, I decided to support Nintendo I decided to download these games and actually pay the price for them so I could have the official emulator and support the people behind it and this is how we get thanked?

43:27.959 --> 43:32.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded ZSNES I know, that's what I'm saying, I could have done that

43:33.061 --> 43:35.403
[SPEAKER_05]: and I could have never supported the whole virtual console thing.

43:35.663 --> 43:39.947
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have the space on my drive to do more WiiWare games and I wouldn't have to worry about any of this.

43:41.788 --> 43:43.029
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

43:43.209 --> 43:45.251
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the thanks we get for supporting Nintendo.

43:45.291 --> 43:45.871
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a geek.

43:47.152 --> 43:47.833
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what?

43:48.874 --> 43:50.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

43:51.249 --> 43:54.430
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not downloading anything else on Virtual Console.

43:54.510 --> 43:55.190
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit.

43:55.230 --> 43:57.871
[SPEAKER_05]: They could put Guardian Legend out on it tomorrow.

43:57.991 --> 43:58.751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not getting it.

43:58.851 --> 44:01.412
[SPEAKER_05]: I will play it on NES emulators.

44:01.452 --> 44:02.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much and be happy.

44:03.053 --> 44:05.133
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not download any more WiiWare titles.

44:05.593 --> 44:10.435
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not support Nintendo's download service until A, this guy is...

44:11.388 --> 44:17.212
[SPEAKER_05]: LetGo, or shifted into another position where he's not speaking on behalf of the company, or B, Nintendo addresses this issue.

44:18.033 --> 44:18.393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

44:18.753 --> 44:35.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I'm not going to suffer because of one idiot, but, you know, I still... I think that it would probably be a bit more... I would have to say... Well, first of all, they're not going to know that you're doing this if you just do it, and they're not going to listen to our podcast.

44:35.845 --> 44:36.505
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

44:37.206 --> 44:40.087
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping maybe some of the listeners will...

44:41.192 --> 44:42.294
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

44:55.359 --> 45:01.762
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not put together some type of organized effort to address it?

45:02.262 --> 45:12.647
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing to say we're going to do this on the show, but another thing to actually send a letter to Nintendo, to the CEO US, to the ones in the UK.

45:12.687 --> 45:18.350
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you saying I should start some type of blog where I encourage people to send letters and join me in this boycott?

45:19.150 --> 45:19.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

45:19.711 --> 45:20.911
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll do it tomorrow.

45:21.412 --> 45:22.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're doing it.

45:23.672 --> 45:24.052
[SPEAKER_04]: We are?

45:25.012 --> 45:25.472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it.

45:25.553 --> 45:25.793
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

45:26.533 --> 45:27.213
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're signing it.

45:27.233 --> 45:28.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm fine with it.

45:28.493 --> 45:33.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really been downloading anything from Nintendo's WiiWare service anyways.

45:33.155 --> 45:35.635
[SPEAKER_03]: My download service actually isn't working, but I did want Pokemon Snap.

45:35.655 --> 45:43.497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing, is I've been trying to support Nintendo, and that's why, you know, you might just think, Rob, get over it, but it's one of these things where, like, dude, this is the marketing director.

45:44.077 --> 45:45.238
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what he's going to say.

45:45.258 --> 45:46.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that Marketing Director UK?

45:47.498 --> 45:48.138
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

45:48.719 --> 45:49.979
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm saying, you know...

45:51.947 --> 46:05.095
[SPEAKER_03]: The letters have to go to him, to whoever his boss is in Nintendo UK, to over here, and probably even to the overall head officer.

46:05.395 --> 46:05.696
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I won't.

46:05.716 --> 46:08.597
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go download it on an emulator and I guess I'll be just fine.

46:08.617 --> 46:08.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fine.

46:21.075 --> 46:21.815
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you have it.

46:22.496 --> 46:23.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what does GameGuru say?

46:24.036 --> 46:26.577
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo will fix the issue for Animal Crossing at E3.

46:26.677 --> 46:28.518
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't, I will join this boycott.

46:29.458 --> 46:40.402
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru, I actually think my boycott will be over by E3 because I think, like I said, I will un-boycott when they address this issue finally and stop pretending it doesn't exist.

46:42.943 --> 46:46.224
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it doesn't get addressed, then it just justifies the boycott even more.

46:47.580 --> 46:49.267
[SPEAKER_05]: So, bleh.

46:49.388 --> 46:51.255
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing is you've got to get enough people to

46:53.018 --> 46:53.578
[SPEAKER_03]: to participate.

46:54.218 --> 46:56.079
[SPEAKER_05]: ShadowTri says, oh, now you go back on it.

46:56.119 --> 46:56.439
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

46:56.479 --> 47:00.561
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the boycott will be over when A, this guy gets let go or B, Nintendo addresses the issue.

47:00.901 --> 47:04.743
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's widely anticipated that Nintendo will address the issue at E3 with some type of storage device.

47:05.223 --> 47:10.725
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think they're going to come out at E3 and say, hey, just for geeks and otakus, this new storage device.

47:10.745 --> 47:18.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's still fucking lame anyways because your average anybody that's using the Wii console needs a storage space because they didn't think it through very well.

47:18.788 --> 47:20.949
[SPEAKER_04]: They were trying to cut costs to make this thing very

47:21.249 --> 47:24.712
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you bragging that there's a hundred... I'm sorry, this isn't you, this isn't Nintendo.

47:24.732 --> 47:32.318
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you bragging that there's a hundred plus different games you can download on virtual console when your stupid thing won't even hold more than twenty?

47:33.490 --> 47:41.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one other thing, though, that I would like to say is that Nintendo does have a track record for creating the demand for something.

47:42.497 --> 47:46.660
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when people are worked up enough about it, they'll release the product.

47:47.100 --> 47:58.769
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would not be at all surprised if they didn't have something like this already in mind, that they put out this massive amount of downloadable content, stuff that's going to fill up all this space.

47:59.409 --> 48:00.890
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when people are like, what do we do?

48:00.930 --> 48:01.431
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do?

48:02.071 --> 48:04.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo comes to save the day with a storage unit.

48:04.472 --> 48:05.493
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something like that.

48:06.093 --> 48:09.335
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says, somebody called you a geek and you're going to boycott over it.

48:09.735 --> 48:10.976
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, yeah.

48:11.296 --> 48:12.937
[SPEAKER_03]: It was meant in a derogatory fashion.

48:13.217 --> 48:20.060
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because it was meant in a derogatory fashion and if we've been supporting the company for all these years and this is the thanks we get, then I'm not going to support it anymore.

48:20.861 --> 48:21.881
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the issue.

48:22.962 --> 48:26.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Online plays for Geeks in a Tacos.

48:27.624 --> 48:28.224
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, a...

48:29.702 --> 48:30.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Avatars are for geeks and tacos.

48:30.842 --> 48:33.163
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-friend codes are for geeks and tacos.

48:34.044 --> 48:34.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Geeks and tacos?

48:35.364 --> 48:36.184
[SPEAKER_04]: No, otakus.

48:36.324 --> 48:37.405
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get tacos.

48:37.425 --> 48:42.547
[SPEAKER_05]: If he said download things were for tacos, I would be, yeah, tacos are rad.

48:42.647 --> 48:48.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to give a GameStop gift certificate to anyone who comes over here and brings us chicken soft tacos.

48:51.330 --> 48:52.010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm serious.

48:52.070 --> 48:53.130
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows where we live.

48:53.711 --> 48:54.231
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people do.

48:54.251 --> 48:54.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I live.

48:54.751 --> 48:55.011
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

48:56.397 --> 48:57.939
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I'm done with my rant.

48:57.959 --> 48:59.100
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we'll get emails on it.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go on to the next story.

49:01.642 --> 49:02.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we have that, don't we?

49:03.224 --> 49:03.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

49:03.945 --> 49:14.816
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for people who are going to be downloading this stuff, who may or may not be participating, but only in the UK, we have five new games out on Virtual Console.

49:14.876 --> 49:19.180
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Alex Kidd Miracle World, which is a good, good game.

49:21.019 --> 49:23.621
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is actually going to be 500 Wii Points.

49:24.722 --> 49:38.973
[SPEAKER_03]: There is Last Ninja and Nebulas for Commodore 64 and both of those are 500 Wii Points and then for Neo Geo we have Ninja Combat and Fatal Fury 2 and those are going to be 900 Wii Points.

49:41.647 --> 49:42.247
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, Rob?

49:42.927 --> 49:48.009
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually come over to my house and play Fatal Fury 2 on my Neo Geo.

49:48.189 --> 49:48.609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do that.

49:48.709 --> 49:49.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to?

49:49.249 --> 49:49.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

49:49.549 --> 49:49.789
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

49:49.869 --> 49:53.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think those Neo Geo cartridges have more storage than a Nintendo Wii.

49:53.710 --> 49:54.810
[SPEAKER_03]: 512 megabytes.

49:55.371 --> 50:01.032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's the same amount of storage in one of those fucking carts than there is in the Nintendo Wii.

50:01.072 --> 50:01.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Same amount.

50:01.572 --> 50:04.333
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that, yeah, they're 512 a piece.

50:06.021 --> 50:11.468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but flash memory is not that expensive, and I don't understand why they couldn't have added more to this.

50:12.649 --> 50:16.654
[SPEAKER_05]: I think seeing as the device will already read a USB thing...

50:18.182 --> 50:20.103
[SPEAKER_05]: or will copy to your SD card.

50:20.904 --> 50:23.405
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see... They could do it with a freaking patch.

50:23.705 --> 50:28.208
[SPEAKER_05]: They could patch the system to temporarily load things off your SD card into the flash memory.

50:28.228 --> 50:29.649
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're worried about piracy.

50:29.669 --> 50:30.329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

50:30.589 --> 50:32.570
[SPEAKER_04]: People are already pirating.

50:32.750 --> 50:33.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

50:33.531 --> 50:34.872
[SPEAKER_04]: People already know how to do it.

50:34.952 --> 50:36.052
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to matter anymore.

50:37.013 --> 50:38.273
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh well.

50:41.218 --> 50:47.240
[SPEAKER_04]: In other news, unrelated to Nintendo, Famitsu Magazine.

50:47.360 --> 50:57.123
[SPEAKER_04]: They're definitely one of the most popular game magazines in Japan, and if you want to get your grubby little hands on a subscription, it's going to cost you quite a bit of money.

50:57.583 --> 51:04.725
[SPEAKER_04]: However, NCSX is offering import subscriptions to Famitsu Magazine, ranging anywhere in Japan.

51:05.745 --> 51:06.826
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have the money for this.

51:07.186 --> 51:13.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywhere from $480 a year to $2,860 a year.

51:13.750 --> 51:19.694
[SPEAKER_04]: $480 per year for 52 issues, because it is a weekly magazine.

51:19.874 --> 51:22.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering they're being shipped from Japan, that's actually not that bad.

51:22.196 --> 51:22.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

51:22.376 --> 51:23.657
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also do the same thing through Yahoo.

51:23.677 --> 51:24.497
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd let you know.

51:24.597 --> 51:25.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for media mail.

51:25.478 --> 51:26.038
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Amazon.

51:26.739 --> 51:28.760
[SPEAKER_04]: And UPS overnight shipping would be $2,860.

51:28.820 --> 51:31.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's overnight shipping.

51:32.042 --> 51:33.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Priority mail is only $626, so...

51:35.273 --> 51:41.817
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the same thing through Amazon and have been able to for a long time because I had, for a little while, a subscription to the Doctor Who magazine.

51:42.818 --> 51:43.078
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

51:44.419 --> 51:45.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Geek, otaku.

51:46.321 --> 51:46.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, Rob.

51:47.081 --> 51:49.002
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it big fat, so what about that?

51:49.223 --> 51:51.084
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing new.

51:51.804 --> 51:55.487
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just doing the same thing that you've been able to do for Amazon for ages and ages.

51:57.488 --> 51:58.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with a little competition.

51:58.789 --> 52:00.971
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go to Kinokuniya and buy them every week, too.

52:01.051 --> 52:01.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

52:05.783 --> 52:06.524
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

52:06.804 --> 52:10.868
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is something, you know, overnighting it to your door that is kind of neat.

52:10.988 --> 52:11.869
[SPEAKER_05]: A week later.

52:12.089 --> 52:12.269
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

52:12.569 --> 52:13.090
[SPEAKER_03]: A week later.

52:14.852 --> 52:19.396
[SPEAKER_03]: And every so often, Kinokuniya will clear them out, you know, a couple weeks after that for half price.

52:19.756 --> 52:20.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully something...

52:20.837 --> 52:23.578
[SPEAKER_05]: Something coming to your door soon will be Mega Man 9.

52:25.358 --> 52:33.401
[SPEAKER_05]: If this is to be believed, Capcom apparently has recently registered Mega Man 9 under Australia's version of the ESRB.

52:33.461 --> 52:37.322
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the OFLC.

52:38.002 --> 52:41.043
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the game is going to be multi-platform.

52:41.683 --> 52:48.626
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could be pretty interesting, especially when you consider a couple weeks ago, didn't Capcom say something about reviving one of their dead franchises?

52:48.946 --> 52:49.766
[SPEAKER_05]: Or there was going to be a couple?

52:50.455 --> 52:52.597
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 9 Mega Man 8 Mega Man 9

53:10.037 --> 53:11.037
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want to see?

53:11.298 --> 53:11.498
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

53:11.898 --> 53:19.721
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a redo of Mega Man 2 with the higher-end graphics, I think.

53:20.641 --> 53:21.802
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it plays the same way.

53:21.842 --> 53:24.503
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was sort of that thing on GameCube, the anniversary condition.

53:24.743 --> 53:25.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but...

53:25.894 --> 53:27.295
[SPEAKER_03]: I want shiny.

53:28.336 --> 53:32.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I would like to see the Mega Man, you know, otaku geek in me would like to see.

53:33.058 --> 53:42.184
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see them kind of do that, like what you're saying, but have the first like three Mega Man games all combined where you could go into the different stages.

53:42.644 --> 53:48.388
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, let's say you could go play in Bubble Man stage and then go to Top Man stage and then the Cuts Man stage.

53:48.408 --> 53:50.169
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could kind of like all of them combined.

53:50.189 --> 53:51.990
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new Rockman Power Battles.

53:53.291 --> 53:54.072
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of cool.

53:54.092 --> 53:54.913
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hot.

53:55.253 --> 53:57.476
[SPEAKER_05]: AJ Mix calls it Mega Man 2 HD Remix.

53:58.577 --> 53:59.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

53:59.238 --> 54:00.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on Xbox 360.

54:00.940 --> 54:01.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

54:01.421 --> 54:01.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

54:02.542 --> 54:03.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like fun.

54:05.025 --> 54:05.406
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

54:06.227 --> 54:06.667
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

54:07.068 --> 54:11.032
[SPEAKER_03]: We should download extra stuff on Xbox 360 and include that in our letter.

54:11.795 --> 54:13.376
[SPEAKER_05]: I already download a lot on Xbox 360.

54:14.076 --> 54:15.997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really nothing new.

54:16.297 --> 54:21.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that thing set to automatically download all demos, which was a pretty brilliant idea.

54:21.700 --> 54:23.981
[SPEAKER_05]: But Xbox can do that because the hard drives are huge.

54:24.001 --> 54:24.682
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 20 gigs.

54:26.202 --> 54:29.344
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need more space, there is a 120 gig hard drive available.

54:29.384 --> 54:29.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

54:30.044 --> 54:31.625
[SPEAKER_05]: That 20 gigs has been more than enough.

54:31.645 --> 54:33.226
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're industrious.

54:33.386 --> 54:35.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially after I deleted Final Fantasy XI.

54:35.887 --> 54:37.048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been more than enough space.

54:37.728 --> 54:40.911
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really watch movies on it, but if I did, I could go get that $120.

54:41.411 --> 54:45.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, you can put stuff on USB, memory card, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

54:47.736 --> 54:51.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft calls it kind of like the Sonic 2 HD version some guys are doing.

54:52.400 --> 54:52.920
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, kind of.

54:53.301 --> 54:56.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Canogram says, Sky, Mega Man Anniversary Collection for GameCube sucks.

54:56.703 --> 54:57.384
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

54:57.424 --> 54:59.746
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the whole GameCube versus PS2.

54:59.786 --> 55:03.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the GameCube had the remix music, it screwed with the buttons and all of that.

55:03.609 --> 55:04.890
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all right, fine, whatever.

55:05.110 --> 55:05.630
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I meant.

55:06.618 --> 55:07.758
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still excited about Mega Man 9.

55:07.878 --> 55:11.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is actually pretty cool.

55:11.880 --> 55:26.085
[SPEAKER_03]: But for people who like their video games turned into movies, like me, as long as they're not fucked up, there is some news about Onimusha and Clock Tower movies.

55:26.165 --> 55:32.067
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, the Clock Tower movie still has Christoph Gans still attached to it, so that's pretty cool.

55:32.267 --> 55:34.668
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool, because I like Silent Hill.

55:34.928 --> 55:35.608
[SPEAKER_05]: I, for one, liked it.

55:36.226 --> 55:45.513
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one's got a... I think actually that and Onimusha are set to come out in 2011.

55:47.555 --> 55:49.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I take that back.

55:49.256 --> 55:55.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Onimusha will be out in 2011 and Clock Tower will be out next year.

55:56.322 --> 55:56.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

55:58.644 --> 55:59.965
[SPEAKER_03]: But it better not suck.

56:00.806 --> 56:01.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Go camp out now.

56:01.706 --> 56:02.867
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob?

56:03.047 --> 56:03.248
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

56:03.648 --> 56:04.809
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a Fatal Frame movie.

56:07.918 --> 56:09.799
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want to see the Silent Hill 2 movie get made.

56:10.120 --> 56:11.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know!

56:11.380 --> 56:12.961
[SPEAKER_03]: It better not suck.

56:14.102 --> 56:14.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they?

56:14.562 --> 56:14.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought.

56:14.963 --> 56:15.483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

56:15.843 --> 56:16.404
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

56:17.444 --> 56:17.745
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

56:20.266 --> 56:26.150
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a lot of stuff coming out this week in game releases in the US on PC.

56:26.831 --> 56:28.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Political Machines 2008.

56:29.152 --> 56:34.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you too can now take part of your own I don't know political election.

56:36.752 --> 56:48.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week we've got the Spore Creature Creator for PC if you want to have a little piece of Spore to play until the actual game comes out.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Although apparently if you know where to look you can already get it.

56:51.102 --> 56:51.763
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the demo.

56:51.783 --> 56:52.863
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear it's quite good.

56:53.284 --> 56:54.244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the demo.

56:55.305 --> 56:56.846
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, I hear it's quite good.

56:57.427 --> 56:59.268
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it myself, but I hear it's good.

57:00.431 --> 57:26.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week, Space Invaders Extreme on the PSP and DS Definitely worth checking out Finally, Imagine Rockstar on the DS Not quite as cool as Imagine Babies, but whatever Imagine Babies is still in my backpack Special in its own way Wacky Races, Crash and Dash Yes, that's based off of that really old cartoon series Does anyone still remember it?

57:26.880 --> 57:27.920
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know No

[SPEAKER_04]: Code Lyoko, Fall of Izana Secret Agent Clank on the PSP Ubisoft's whoring yet another Pets franchise Pets Dogs Fashion That's right, dogs dressed up like things.

57:46.048 --> 57:46.688
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

57:47.909 --> 57:48.409
[SPEAKER_04]: But not.

57:50.010 --> 57:51.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop anthropomorphizing our animals.

57:52.912 --> 57:54.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Arkanoid on the DS.

57:54.814 --> 57:55.414
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

57:55.775 --> 57:57.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Tamagotchi Connection Corner 3

58:00.703 --> 58:03.384
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band Special Edition Guitar Hero On Tour Game Releases

58:20.127 --> 58:22.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much more upbeat over in Japan either.

58:22.648 --> 58:24.529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a slow period for release dates in Japan.

58:24.569 --> 58:30.491
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the Xbox 360 on June 19th, you can pick up Flat Out Ultimate Carnage if you want to get that.

58:31.231 --> 58:33.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Because their releases tend to be on Fridays.

58:34.893 --> 58:39.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Over on the PlayStation 3, not a lot coming out this week.

58:39.455 --> 58:40.535
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned for next week.

[SPEAKER_05]: Another version of Harukanaro Chiku no Kare comes out on the PlayStation 2.

59:10.896 --> 59:15.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Love Drops and Odin Sphere get moved into the best, meaning they get price drops.

[SPEAKER_03]: MyPony!

01:00:16.892 --> 01:00:20.115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking that's a game they need to release over here a little quicker.

01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:21.616
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is out over here, though.

01:00:22.177 --> 01:00:26.080
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Sony PSP, God of War, Chains of Olympus comes out in Chinese.

01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:28.762
[SPEAKER_05]: It's localized for Chinese, so that's coming out this week.

01:00:28.782 --> 01:00:32.125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not Japan, but Asia in general comes out of there.

01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:38.591
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming out on the Sony PSP, Secret Agent Clank, Super Robot Taisen, a portable.

[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

01:00:59.428 --> 01:01:00.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it my turn?

01:01:00.429 --> 01:01:00.929
[SPEAKER_05]: It is your turn.

01:01:00.969 --> 01:01:02.590
[SPEAKER_03]: We has games over in the UK.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:03.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of them.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:04.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a few of them.

01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:05.511
[SPEAKER_03]: But on lots of systems.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.023
[SPEAKER_03]: And Top Spin on Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

01:01:29.966 --> 01:01:32.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be confused with that really cool car show, Top Gear.

01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:42.789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at Justin TV chat right now, which I don't usually watch during the show, but I know we have some people who can only watch on Justin TV because, for whatever reason, the other ways to listen to this are banned.

01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:48.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Ikuma JP, who actually lives in Japan, pays me a compliment and says, I understand Sky's Japanese now.

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:49.890
[SPEAKER_05]: That is quite the compliment, actually.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:50.870
[SPEAKER_05]: Never had a lesson.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:58.432
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just saying, it really is, I guess with practice, you know, and I have noticed you picking up a little vocabulary.

01:01:59.491 --> 01:01:59.791
[SPEAKER_05]: A little.

01:02:00.011 --> 01:02:00.311
[SPEAKER_03]: A little.

01:02:01.031 --> 01:02:01.312
[SPEAKER_05]: A little.

01:02:02.312 --> 01:02:02.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's picking up stuff.

01:02:03.012 --> 01:02:04.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty soon I'm going to start answering my phone.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:04.972
[SPEAKER_05]: Mushy, mushy.

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:05.633
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:08.994
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, AkumaJP brings up that whole difference.

01:02:09.074 --> 01:02:10.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Mega Man the same thing as Rockman?

01:02:10.914 --> 01:02:11.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:13.575
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockman is what it is in Japan and Europe.

01:02:13.975 --> 01:02:15.995
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they called it Mega Man here.

01:02:16.035 --> 01:02:21.537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking that maybe they thought if they called the game Rockman, people would have thought it was like a rock band or rock music.

01:02:21.557 --> 01:02:23.057
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:02:23.097 --> 01:02:25.238
[SPEAKER_03]: The girl assistant was Roll.

01:02:26.707 --> 01:02:28.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, rock and roll.

01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:36.035
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe is it because Guts Man was kind of a rock character and they didn't want people to think he was a bad guy?

01:02:36.135 --> 01:02:37.276
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:02:37.997 --> 01:02:39.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people don't get it.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:41.560
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.383
[SPEAKER_05]: They did have a lot of those changes back in the day.

01:02:45.259 --> 01:02:45.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Random.

01:02:45.799 --> 01:02:48.961
[SPEAKER_03]: And the really ugly cover that Mega Man 2 had.

01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:50.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:53.923
[SPEAKER_03]: This is when Capcom was like, let's Americanize all of the art.

01:02:53.963 --> 01:02:55.344
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty awesome cover.

01:02:55.764 --> 01:03:00.667
[SPEAKER_03]: The only, I think, good one that was done was one of the Metal Gear ones that looked like it had Michael Biehn on it.

01:03:01.907 --> 01:03:03.148
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, Terminator.

01:03:03.604 --> 01:03:06.268
[SPEAKER_05]: Akuma, you've got to check that out if you've never seen it.

01:03:06.348 --> 01:03:10.513
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Google Art and search for the Mega Man 2 box art because it's pretty epic.

01:03:10.634 --> 01:03:14.238
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, if you live overseas and you've never seen it, it's pretty hilarious.

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Prepare to weep.

01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:17.863
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hideous.

01:03:18.404 --> 01:03:19.565
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get back to some gaming news.

01:03:49.167 --> 01:03:50.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're so close.

01:03:50.588 --> 01:03:51.429
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so close.

01:03:51.529 --> 01:03:51.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Warmer.

01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:52.750
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting warmer.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:53.951
[SPEAKER_04]: So close.

01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:54.451
[SPEAKER_04]: You're warm.

01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:58.614
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the other one is, but we know what one of them is.

01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:01.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Bionic Commando Rearmed.

01:04:03.678 --> 01:04:08.602
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess considering that E3 is coming out mid-July, it'd probably be out before then.

01:04:10.043 --> 01:04:13.386
[SPEAKER_04]: And Halo Wars was there, but Alan Wake was not.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:38.674
[SPEAKER_04]: and the list is still very incomplete right now so there's you know no Atari, Codemasters, Crave, Disney, Eidos, Konami, LucasArts, MTV, Nintendo, Sega, Sony Online, Square Enix, Take-Two, Tecmo, THQ, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers Interactive so that's a big uh gap right there a big list but um

01:04:41.099 --> 01:04:47.103
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm reading in chat about the whole Rockman vs. Mega Man thing, and GameGuru is saying Rocks is slang for crack.

01:04:47.863 --> 01:04:50.425
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe that's why they didn't want to release it here.

01:04:50.445 --> 01:04:52.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people would have thought it was Crackman.

01:04:52.386 --> 01:04:56.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I don't know, if you release a game called Crackman, I think it might actually sell pretty well.

01:04:57.398 --> 01:04:58.239
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that Pac-Man overseas is called Puck-Man?

01:05:24.263 --> 01:05:24.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:25.484
[SPEAKER_05]: P-U-C-K-Man.

01:05:25.764 --> 01:05:27.405
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know why they didn't release that here?

01:05:27.805 --> 01:05:35.229
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they were afraid that people were going to take their magic markers and color over the P with an F. I swear to God, I read it on Wikipedia, therefore it's true.

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:37.250
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:37.771
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:05:38.211 --> 01:05:39.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

01:05:39.532 --> 01:05:39.712
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:41.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story.

01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:41.973
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:05:43.584 --> 01:05:44.225
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, we can do that.

01:05:44.705 --> 01:05:46.747
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, Jamie, this might be of interest to you.

01:05:46.787 --> 01:05:49.910
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever wanted to have a life-size Solid Snake statue?

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... Hey?

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:54.718
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.420
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, we ought to get one of these for the studio.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.641
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of rad, actually.

01:05:58.661 --> 01:05:59.942
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking auction.

01:06:00.362 --> 01:06:01.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well here's the thing.

01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:07.448
[SPEAKER_05]: What Sam's Club is doing, Sam's Club is actually selling a life-size statue of the old snake.

01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:10.630
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's being sold starting this upcoming week.

01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:13.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it's not something you can actually go into the store and buy.

01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:15.654
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being auctioned.

01:06:16.394 --> 01:06:43.070
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's actually in a Walmart blog that originally announced this called Checkout I had no idea there were blogs about Walmart you learn new things every day you can find it on auctions.samsclub.com and if you search for Metal Gear Solid you can find the stand-up which I would love to have one of here in studio but somehow I don't think that's going to happen I'm going to guess that's probably going to go for a lot of money

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.007
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one thing I've ever won.

01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:47.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the money going to charity or anything?

01:06:47.788 --> 01:06:48.468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will be.

01:06:48.788 --> 01:06:51.309
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one thing I've ever won from a charity auction.

01:06:51.329 --> 01:06:53.849
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to search for it and it says sold out.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.430
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's up with that?

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:58.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it doesn't start until Monday or something.

01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:03.492
[SPEAKER_04]: I've won one thing off of a charity auction for gaming related stuff.

01:07:03.612 --> 01:07:03.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

01:07:04.272 --> 01:07:05.452
[SPEAKER_04]: True Crime New York City.

01:07:05.512 --> 01:07:08.233
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a poster signed by the entire cast.

01:07:09.614 --> 01:07:11.034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at work though, framed.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.601
[SPEAKER_04]: True Crime, New York City

01:07:26.567 --> 01:07:26.847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:07:27.107 --> 01:07:29.048
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it, and it was cool.

01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:32.549
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the poster that they had, the little teaser poster, before they announced that it was New York City.

01:07:33.089 --> 01:07:35.130
[SPEAKER_04]: You were supposed to guess, you know, what city it was.

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:36.550
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, right, right, yeah.

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:43.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this auction is not up until next week, but I'll tell you what, if it's a reasonable price, I might go put a bid on it.

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:43.953
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

01:07:44.453 --> 01:07:45.994
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll probably get outbid pretty quick.

01:07:47.074 --> 01:07:47.674
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be fun.

01:07:47.694 --> 01:07:50.275
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you like to have Solid Snake sitting in the corner of the studio?

01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:51.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Young Hot Snake.

01:07:53.196 --> 01:07:54.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Old Man Snake.

01:07:54.476 --> 01:07:55.817
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine, then I won't bid on it.

01:07:56.513 --> 01:08:04.836
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not going to appreciate the things I do for you... I'm not saying I wouldn't mind it, but now if it was, you know, if he had the camo mask, that'd be awesome.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.136
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll figure something out.

01:08:06.156 --> 01:08:07.517
[SPEAKER_05]: I could put the Dr. Dick hat on him.

01:08:07.657 --> 01:08:08.517
[SPEAKER_05]: The little orange hat here.

01:08:08.777 --> 01:08:13.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if Justin TVers can see it because it's kind of blurry, but we could give that to Solid Snake.

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:14.479
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:08:14.659 --> 01:08:15.179
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

01:08:16.448 --> 01:08:44.380
[SPEAKER_03]: well something else that's sort of noteworthy is rumors going around that Sony was going to make an EPS3 controller that would break into two parts so that you could use it I guess like a Wiimote there was actually no real clear information given about it but what it actually turns out to be like I said rumor is that it was supposed to be a controller that has parts that will attach to it

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.521
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:09:13.599 --> 01:09:13.980
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Rob.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Hail Jamie.

01:09:14.821 --> 01:09:15.342
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Rob.

01:09:15.462 --> 01:09:15.662
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:09:16.043 --> 01:09:17.364
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that you might think this is funny.

01:09:17.404 --> 01:09:20.949
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded the entire Vehicle Voltron series.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:22.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was awesome!

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:25.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:09:26.597 --> 01:09:26.997
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:09:27.718 --> 01:09:27.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

01:09:28.894 --> 01:09:30.935
[SPEAKER_04]: AVENGED SEVENFOLD, OFFSPRING, CROOKED X

01:09:50.022 --> 01:09:55.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Acclaim by Avenged Sevenfold as well for 160 Microsoft Points, also $2.

01:09:56.886 --> 01:10:01.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Hammerhead by The Offspring for 160 Microsoft Points, also $2.

01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:08.652
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, Rock and Roll Dream by CrookedX for 80 Microsoft Points or $1.

01:10:09.753 --> 01:10:12.074
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what you're getting for Rock Band.

01:10:13.134 --> 01:10:13.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to...

01:10:14.468 --> 01:10:19.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 3, Coldplay, Violet Hill, Yellow, and God Put a Smile on Your Face

01:10:35.191 --> 01:10:37.932
[SPEAKER_04]: from the album A Rush of Blood to the Head.

01:10:38.412 --> 01:10:40.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I just don't think you could jam to The Scientist.

01:10:41.013 --> 01:10:43.473
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they kind of had to put these other songs on there.

01:10:43.693 --> 01:10:44.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:10:44.233 --> 01:10:45.294
[SPEAKER_04]: At least have some guitar in them.

01:10:45.514 --> 01:10:51.455
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to bring you 500 Microsoft points or $6.25 via the PlayStation Network.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:52.976
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:10:54.036 --> 01:10:54.776
[SPEAKER_05]: I might actually check.

01:10:54.796 --> 01:10:55.676
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Coldplay.

01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:56.337
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty cool.

01:10:57.077 --> 01:10:57.557
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:10:57.597 --> 01:11:01.298
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think of myself as rocking out to them on Guitar Hero, but that could be interesting.

01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:05.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Coldplay's got some pretty guitar-heavy stuff.

01:11:05.389 --> 01:11:08.169
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true, but maybe I think... Some fairly melodious guitar, I'd have to say.

01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:12.410
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite Coldplay stuff is their more slowed-down stuff, like The Scientist, Fix You.

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.511
[SPEAKER_05]: I like all those really slow, whiny songs.

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:15.431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I like.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my favorite one they did is Talk.

01:11:17.492 --> 01:11:17.772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:11:18.632 --> 01:11:19.452
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was a good song.

01:11:19.632 --> 01:11:20.252
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really good song.

01:11:20.272 --> 01:11:21.072
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my favorite one by them.

01:11:21.272 --> 01:11:21.532
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:11:22.413 --> 01:11:23.533
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, why isn't that in Guitar Hero?

01:11:23.553 --> 01:11:24.413
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be in Guitar Hero.

01:11:24.853 --> 01:11:25.233
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be.

01:11:25.253 --> 01:11:26.294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:11:26.314 --> 01:11:27.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe in Coldplay Pack 2.

01:11:29.005 --> 01:11:32.908
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Rock Band 2 is going to be featuring this band.

01:11:33.008 --> 01:11:35.389
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never heard of this band in my entire life.

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:38.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Their name is Turbo Negro?

01:11:38.691 --> 01:11:39.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the name of them?

01:11:40.393 --> 01:11:41.053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know.

01:11:41.153 --> 01:11:45.756
[SPEAKER_05]: This band apparently is going to be... I guess it's one of those cool... I mean, look at this guy.

01:11:45.796 --> 01:11:48.618
[SPEAKER_05]: He's wearing like a ginormous fur, like, train.

01:11:48.918 --> 01:11:50.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a bride would wear.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:53.121
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what impression I'm getting of them, Rob?

01:11:53.181 --> 01:11:53.421
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:11:53.802 --> 01:11:53.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Is...

01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:55.183
[SPEAKER_05]: The Village People.

01:11:55.203 --> 01:11:56.144
[SPEAKER_03]: The Village People, right.

01:11:56.184 --> 01:11:59.387
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a sailor and you've got like the bride.

01:11:59.467 --> 01:12:00.568
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never... You have the pimp.

01:12:00.929 --> 01:12:02.651
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never heard... God, I feel old.

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.033
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously have never heard of this band.

01:12:05.073 --> 01:12:06.194
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm so out of touch with youth.

01:12:06.214 --> 01:12:06.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, don't feel bad.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither have I. All right, good.

01:12:07.796 --> 01:12:09.558
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I see bad religion, so...

01:12:09.898 --> 01:12:10.538
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, hold on.

01:12:10.578 --> 01:12:11.459
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get to that for a minute.

01:12:12.279 --> 01:12:23.403
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here's the thing is that when Age of Conan, you know, the big MMO, apparently they put out a press release here saying that, you know, because this band, I guess, is going to be doing the Age of Conan soundtrack.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:23.864
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

01:12:23.884 --> 01:12:25.564
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to be in Rock Band 2.

01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:33.547
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bad Religion is also supposedly supposed to be in the Rock Band sequel, even though Jamie gave that away.

01:12:33.788 --> 01:12:34.188
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry!

01:12:34.568 --> 01:12:35.268
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was thanks to Twitter.

01:12:38.086 --> 01:12:44.132
[SPEAKER_05]: The guitarist and songwriter from Bad Religion, Brett Gurewitz, said in his Twitter, he posted this twit.

01:12:44.792 --> 01:12:51.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven meetings and four executive decisions later, back at Sound City, putting the finishing touches on Sorrow for Rock Band 2.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.063
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised he was able to post that with Twitter being down as much as it's down.

01:12:57.044 --> 01:12:57.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they?

01:12:57.444 --> 01:12:58.646
[SPEAKER_05]: They better be Nordic death metal.

01:12:58.666 --> 01:12:59.506
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:01.508
[SPEAKER_05]: They are from Oslo, Norway.

01:13:01.608 --> 01:13:02.029
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:04.870
[SPEAKER_05]: All of my friends are dead All of my friends are dead

01:13:33.797 --> 01:13:34.938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna download this right now.

01:13:35.819 --> 01:13:36.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie approves.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:37.680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm downloading it.

01:13:37.841 --> 01:13:38.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you go.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.784
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bad Religion does... Did I Love My Computer?

01:13:42.305 --> 01:13:46.088
[SPEAKER_04]: That would work well with like a Grand Theft Auto 4 video that I could possibly film.

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:55.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we like playing this game during lunch where we put friendly fire off and then we fire rockets at each other so we get rocket jumped.

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:57.057
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun.

01:13:57.618 --> 01:13:59.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenocor says it's Nordic Punk, not death metal.

01:14:01.298 --> 01:14:03.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's that song by Bad Religion, by the way, in case you were wondering.

01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:18.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, thankfully, I have heard of Bad Religion.

01:14:18.424 --> 01:14:20.304
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an album called Apocalypse Dudes.

01:14:21.245 --> 01:14:21.825
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

01:14:24.274 --> 01:14:28.816
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Dragonforce supposedly has a new album out in August.

01:14:29.316 --> 01:14:30.276
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep an eye out for that.

01:14:30.356 --> 01:14:31.477
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

01:14:31.557 --> 01:14:32.637
[SPEAKER_05]: Your rock band update.

01:14:33.438 --> 01:14:37.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the segment where the old hosts of OLR learn about new bands that kids are into.

01:14:38.019 --> 01:14:38.879
[SPEAKER_03]: I just downloaded it.

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.140
[SPEAKER_03]: That song that you played.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my computer is great, so shut up.

01:14:43.741 --> 01:14:44.321
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway.

01:14:44.982 --> 01:14:45.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:45.942 --> 01:14:47.643
[SPEAKER_05]: You downloaded that on your iPhone, didn't you?

01:14:47.744 --> 01:14:48.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Just now.

01:14:48.244 --> 01:14:53.287
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask, what did you think about the iPhone announcements on Monday about the new sleeker, cheaper one?

01:14:54.685 --> 01:14:55.385
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

01:14:56.365 --> 01:14:58.346
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... I didn't want a GPS.

01:14:59.306 --> 01:15:02.487
[SPEAKER_03]: And I already have an 8GB iPhone.

01:15:03.427 --> 01:15:05.587
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can just update my OS on it.

01:15:05.807 --> 01:15:07.188
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't care.

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:07.968
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna get one.

01:15:08.308 --> 01:15:08.768
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one.

01:15:09.108 --> 01:15:12.429
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I already wanted an iPhone, and that just kind of upped the ante a little bit.

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:15.209
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the... And then... I have to ask kids.

01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:18.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did you think of the iPhone announcements that happened on Monday?

01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:23.571
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really care, because it said, well, the slim thing, it's slim around the edges, but it's actually thicker.

01:15:25.553 --> 01:15:39.553
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently it's going to have that new finish on the outside either white or black which is supposed to be really easy to scratch instead of how they already had it perfect where it wouldn't scratch that easy and also there's supposed to be a bunch of hidden fees

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome!

01:15:41.071 --> 01:15:42.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a phone for me.

01:15:42.592 --> 01:15:44.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Really expensive and filled with fees.

01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:50.339
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that was the other thing, is that if they're going to be cutting costs in one way, they're going to try to get it from you another way.

01:15:51.039 --> 01:15:52.821
[SPEAKER_05]: They upped the price of the plan, is what they did.

01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:54.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something like that.

01:15:54.482 --> 01:16:05.252
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sitting here with my, you know, I paid $400 for my iPhone, sure, but this thing has fucking lasted me, and it's fallen from my pocket and landed on the floor and lived.

01:16:06.253 --> 01:16:07.233
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll see you next time.

01:16:22.247 --> 01:16:22.467
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:16:23.488 --> 01:16:28.952
[SPEAKER_05]: Joshi16 comments on the last story saying, You know, Sky, cool kids listen to Ashley Simpson, so you should too.

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:30.914
[SPEAKER_05]: Now look, I'm not that old.

01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:33.075
[SPEAKER_05]: I know no one listens to Ashley Simpson, okay?

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.236
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what was cool with her.

01:16:34.416 --> 01:16:34.596
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:16:35.277 --> 01:16:37.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Her interview on the Charlotte Church show.

01:16:37.739 --> 01:16:39.280
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten to be where I like that show.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.483
[SPEAKER_05]: I still can't get over that Charlotte Church had like a hip talk show overseas.

01:16:43.503 --> 01:16:44.604
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny.

01:16:44.944 --> 01:16:45.284
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

01:16:45.464 --> 01:16:47.086
[SPEAKER_05]: She's fucking Charlotte Church.

01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:48.066
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's hilarious.

01:16:48.086 --> 01:16:49.988
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the 11-year-old girl that's saying, What?

01:16:51.449 --> 01:16:52.770
[SPEAKER_03]: She's freaking hilarious.

01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:54.470
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you should watch the... Okay, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:58.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch the... Go on YouTube later and watch the interview.

01:16:58.253 --> 01:16:59.834
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen clips of the Charlotte Church show.

01:16:59.854 --> 01:17:01.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you watch the interview with John Barrowman?

01:17:01.955 --> 01:17:02.175
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:17:02.575 --> 01:17:03.316
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch that.

01:17:03.496 --> 01:17:04.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will.

01:17:05.157 --> 01:17:08.519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's seriously, you know, a boy and his hag.

01:17:08.799 --> 01:17:10.660
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the whole conversation.

01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:14.042
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their whole conversation.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:17:16.234 --> 01:17:17.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that show still producing?

01:17:17.779 --> 01:17:22.592
[SPEAKER_03]: She put it on hiatus after she had her baby, but was talking about bringing it back up.

01:17:23.237 --> 01:17:28.341
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading an interview where she wanted to get Paris Hilton on the show so she could make fun of her.

01:17:28.361 --> 01:17:28.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:29.622
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I thought that'd be funny.

01:17:53.223 --> 01:17:55.104
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gone, let's see, what have we talked about tonight?

01:17:55.124 --> 01:17:57.546
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about D&D, we talked about international TV.

01:17:59.428 --> 01:18:02.490
[SPEAKER_05]: You know something is wrong with OLR when we're talking about Charlotte Church's life.

01:18:03.371 --> 01:18:05.032
[SPEAKER_03]: But her show's funny.

01:18:05.052 --> 01:18:06.513
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, talk about video games, Jamie.

01:18:07.254 --> 01:18:07.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-uh.

01:18:07.854 --> 01:18:08.094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:09.095
[SPEAKER_03]: The Agency.

01:18:09.675 --> 01:18:11.097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there we go, warmer.

01:18:11.597 --> 01:18:15.100
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to have the thing, the word that I hate, that I will not use.

01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:24.330
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not going to have the arbitrary transactions that occur within the game that some people have used the term micro as a prefix to.

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.450
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:26.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Micro machines?

01:18:27.612 --> 01:18:27.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

01:18:29.514 --> 01:18:34.438
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not going to be using an arbitrary transition system within the agency.

01:18:35.239 --> 01:18:42.625
[SPEAKER_03]: They are actually going to have an in-game currency that you will use like a lot of MMOs have in an auction house.

01:18:42.925 --> 01:18:44.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like a microtransaction.

01:18:46.604 --> 01:18:50.906
[SPEAKER_03]: You will not be using actual currency to purchase your money in-game.

01:18:53.107 --> 01:18:55.629
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be using the in-game currency that you use.

01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:59.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like buying your weapons in Metal Gear Solid 4.

01:19:02.312 --> 01:19:05.974
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is not an arbitrary transaction because it's no money out of your pocket.

01:19:06.806 --> 01:19:07.106
[SPEAKER_01]: He died.

01:19:07.126 --> 01:19:10.229
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because he figured out that in your life, you can only say so many words before you die.

01:19:10.249 --> 01:19:10.490
[SPEAKER_01]: And well...

01:19:30.871 --> 01:19:32.932
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he just blew through those real quick.

01:19:33.112 --> 01:19:34.012
[SPEAKER_04]: You are horrible.

01:19:34.252 --> 01:19:34.832
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

01:19:35.552 --> 01:19:40.754
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually, I very, very much like him, though, because he was also Blur in Transformers, the movie.

01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:45.275
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also the Scatman.

01:19:45.315 --> 01:19:46.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that the same guy?

01:19:46.256 --> 01:19:46.356
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:19:46.456 --> 01:19:46.636
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:19:47.096 --> 01:19:48.336
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was the same guy.

01:19:48.576 --> 01:19:48.696
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:19:50.677 --> 01:19:53.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I always thought Scatman and the Microchips guy were the same fucking guy.

01:19:53.598 --> 01:19:55.238
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Scatman Crothers was Hong Kong Philly.

01:19:55.979 --> 01:19:56.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they did both die.

01:19:57.423 --> 01:19:58.144
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that's sad.

01:19:58.164 --> 01:19:58.846
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sad.

01:19:59.487 --> 01:20:00.729
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Loki's on to something.

01:20:02.051 --> 01:20:03.574
[SPEAKER_03]: As I was saying... Alright, sorry.

01:20:04.095 --> 01:20:05.718
[SPEAKER_04]: We're screwed too then.

01:20:08.257 --> 01:20:35.255
[SPEAKER_03]: the live gamer system is going to be used basically to set up like it is in EverQuest 2 where they use Golden Game as a transaction but they said that they were planning on using alternate mechanics to use outside of in-game play I guess for purchasing things that go along with it but not necessarily as an integral part of the gameplay

01:20:35.609 --> 01:20:46.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you're gonna call you on your cell phone and shit, too, in this game, like, tell you, hey, Bob's, you know, been kidnapped, do you want to, you know, Do you give a shit?

01:20:46.513 --> 01:20:47.853
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to pay the ransom?

01:20:48.073 --> 01:20:48.273
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:20:48.353 --> 01:20:50.374
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, fucking stop calling me at work!

01:20:51.674 --> 01:20:53.035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not playing you anymore!

01:20:53.055 --> 01:20:54.996
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:20:56.296 --> 01:20:57.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, technology.

01:20:57.456 --> 01:20:58.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love it.

01:21:00.517 --> 01:21:02.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of technology, though, Whatever.

01:21:03.278 --> 01:21:04.659
[SPEAKER_02]: Not you, not you, Bob.

01:21:05.059 --> 01:21:05.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:06.750
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:21:07.671 --> 01:21:13.417
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Rob just looks over here and he has this amused expression and I'm like, whatever.

01:21:14.258 --> 01:21:15.059
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm funny.

01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:18.683
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a fun guy like a fungus.

01:21:20.706 --> 01:21:21.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story.

01:21:21.587 --> 01:21:30.272
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so speaking of technology, Capcom is offering fans of the Street Fighter series to get their face into the game.

01:21:31.073 --> 01:21:41.140
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to Capcom's Unity blog, they posted a call for fans to submit their story and why they should be in Street Fighter 4.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:47.664
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send them anything from a new belly dancing telegram to something a little bit more elaborate.

01:21:47.924 --> 01:21:49.605
[SPEAKER_04]: Just you have to send it by June 18th.

01:21:52.268 --> 01:21:53.108
[SPEAKER_05]: Better get started.

01:21:53.389 --> 01:21:53.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:21:54.430 --> 01:22:05.080
[SPEAKER_04]: And you email your submissions to contest at capcom.com along with your name, phone number, age, and email address.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.002
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, are you going to get your face in Street Fighter 4?

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:07.763
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really care.

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:08.343
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should.

01:22:09.144 --> 01:22:09.304
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:22:09.464 --> 01:22:10.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Will someone else send in Loki's face?

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:11.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Say it's theirs?

01:22:14.232 --> 01:22:15.433
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'd like to see happen.

01:22:16.073 --> 01:22:22.056
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever these companies have these contests for Get Your Face in the Game, I want to see people just send in Loki's picture.

01:22:23.557 --> 01:22:26.558
[SPEAKER_04]: I know which picture they'll send, and that's not going to work.

01:22:28.899 --> 01:22:29.860
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:31.981
[SPEAKER_04]: I will sue them.

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:35.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another game I'd like to see Loki in.

01:22:35.424 --> 01:22:37.045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rose and Camellia.

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:38.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever heard of this game?

01:22:38.786 --> 01:22:39.807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the slapping game.

01:22:39.827 --> 01:22:41.508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the slap a woman game.

01:22:41.568 --> 01:22:44.150
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've seen this.

01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:47.492
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not domestic violence or any of that stuff that's not cool.

01:22:47.852 --> 01:22:57.439
[SPEAKER_05]: This is that old ladies in big floofy dresses taking their white gloves off and slapping the other woman in a dramatic soap opera fashion.

01:22:57.719 --> 01:23:00.400
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have remembered this game from a couple months ago.

01:23:00.441 --> 01:23:01.201
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Flash game.

01:23:01.401 --> 01:23:02.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

01:23:02.782 --> 01:23:06.004
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have it on the DS via homebrew too, Jamie.

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:06.484
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

01:23:06.804 --> 01:23:11.247
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a brand new sequel to Rose and Camellia.

01:23:11.307 --> 01:23:12.388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rose and Camellia 2.

01:23:13.468 --> 01:23:14.609
[SPEAKER_05]: All new women to slap.

01:23:15.129 --> 01:23:16.070
[SPEAKER_05]: All new stages.

01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:19.752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all the things you loved about the first game, but more.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:21.873
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I have to retract my statement.

01:23:22.053 --> 01:23:22.173
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:23:22.453 --> 01:23:23.194
[SPEAKER_03]: John Machida Jr.

01:23:23.234 --> 01:23:23.594
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't dead.

01:23:26.176 --> 01:23:27.536
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the guy who did the Microchips?

01:23:28.257 --> 01:23:30.858
[SPEAKER_05]: So you must have thought he was Scatman John 2 subconsciously.

01:23:31.018 --> 01:23:31.859
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's Scatman Crothers.

01:23:32.794 --> 01:23:34.375
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, whatever.

01:23:35.315 --> 01:23:35.655
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

01:23:38.696 --> 01:23:40.317
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

01:23:40.477 --> 01:23:42.358
[SPEAKER_05]: People report that celebrities are dead all the time.

01:23:43.078 --> 01:23:45.219
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, here's the thing though.

01:23:45.559 --> 01:23:48.020
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot just get the sequel that easy.

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:53.862
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to actually beat the original Rose and Camellia to get the sequel.

01:23:56.043 --> 01:23:58.464
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think the first game was that hard from what I remember.

01:23:58.864 --> 01:23:59.364
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's there.

01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:01.165
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:04.499
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is this week's classic game of the week?

01:24:27.279 --> 01:24:30.921
[SPEAKER_03]: I went for Obscure, as in Obscure System.

01:24:31.742 --> 01:24:34.383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game that came out on the 32X.

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:36.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Have I done 32X games before?

01:24:36.424 --> 01:24:37.465
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've had a 32X game yet.

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:41.347
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I might have done... I haven't done Space Harrier, have I?

01:24:41.927 --> 01:24:42.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to my knowledge.

01:24:42.487 --> 01:24:43.768
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not doing Space Harrier today.

01:24:44.509 --> 01:24:46.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing Knuckles Chaotix.

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:48.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Knuckles Chaotix is cool.

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:51.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue that beautiful bean footage.

01:24:51.934 --> 01:24:52.574
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying.

01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:53.435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take me a minute.

01:24:53.475 --> 01:24:54.815
[SPEAKER_05]: The YouTube-y is buffering.

01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:57.016
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us a little bit about Knuckles Chaotix.

01:24:57.456 --> 01:25:00.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Knuckles Chaotix in Japan was called just Chaotix.

01:25:01.058 --> 01:25:07.781
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does feature Knuckles and a bunch of his buddies hanging out on a different island.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:08.462
[SPEAKER_03]: And Knuckles is...

01:25:11.636 --> 01:25:11.916
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:13.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

01:25:13.797 --> 01:25:17.458
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, you actually have different buddies that go along with you.

01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:19.619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a buddy system game where you're joined by rings.

01:25:20.259 --> 01:25:22.159
[SPEAKER_03]: And a band joins the rings together.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.201
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, say that you are using Knuckles as your main guy.

01:25:27.941 --> 01:25:32.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Knuckles will be able to climb up walls and float across.

01:25:34.443 --> 01:25:35.444
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually use...

01:25:37.938 --> 01:25:41.361
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that SPO does some type of drill move or something.

01:25:41.941 --> 01:25:47.425
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole point of the game is to use a spuddy system to make it through the five different worlds in the game.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:48.666
[SPEAKER_03]: They're called attractions.

01:25:49.306 --> 01:25:56.872
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, get to the end and kick MechaSonic's ass and tell Eggman he can piss off.

01:25:57.833 --> 01:26:02.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the characters in the game actually did make it into Sonic Heroes.

01:26:02.276 --> 01:26:04.758
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be SPO, Vector, and Charmy.

01:26:06.379 --> 01:26:06.539
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:22.565
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the other thing about this game is that it's one of the first to have, at least on the 32X, I think they had a battery backup on its own, which would save your game and you could go back to it at any time.

01:26:27.427 --> 01:26:31.048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just, and I'm sure you're watching the gameplay right now, right?

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:39.344
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and to be honest, since I never had a 32X or a Sega Genesis, I mean, sure, I played Sonic the Hedgehog at my friend's house, but I never really played this game, like, ever.

01:26:39.824 --> 01:26:45.007
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks a lot like regular Sonic, but with a little bit of this buddy action kind of going on.

01:26:45.187 --> 01:26:49.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the other thing about that is that you do... You've also got your bonus stages and special stages.

01:26:50.409 --> 01:26:54.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Your bonus stage, you collect 20 more rings by jumping through large rings that are hidden in the level.

01:26:54.871 --> 01:26:57.213
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got spiral free falls and that sort of thing.

01:26:58.173 --> 01:26:58.893
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also...

01:27:00.294 --> 01:27:01.876
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

01:27:18.018 --> 01:27:19.219
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say that they were.

01:27:19.399 --> 01:27:20.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me on that quite yet.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:35.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Also now, for the people who were into the really, really obscure, there was something that came out on the Genesis emulators back in the day that was called Sonic Crackers.

01:27:36.146 --> 01:27:37.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever remember this, Rob?

01:27:38.868 --> 01:27:39.148
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.

01:27:40.097 --> 01:27:48.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Crackers, which had also been titled the Sonic Stadium in Sonic the Hedgehog 4, was a game featuring Sonic and Tails linked by rings.

01:27:49.687 --> 01:28:00.518
[SPEAKER_03]: And the very interesting thing about this is that it was pretty much officially called the prototype for Knuckles Chaotix.

01:28:01.418 --> 01:28:09.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Proven by the fact that in one of the early Chaotix builds, actually the December 7, 1994 build, the same sprites for Sonic and Tails were found.

01:28:09.801 --> 01:28:17.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Although my personal theory is that Sonic and Tails were just used, because it's their Sonic 1 sprites, were used for developmental purposes, to build the engine.

01:28:18.123 --> 01:28:25.526
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's levels that actually cross over that have big similarities to levels that were in Chaotix.

01:28:26.386 --> 01:28:28.889
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's very, very interesting.

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really, you know, half the game.

01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:34.455
[SPEAKER_03]: You get through with repeating levels and lots of deterioration in the data.

01:28:35.156 --> 01:28:42.064
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, there's, uh, actually Amy Rose is in the sound test on Knuckles Chaotix.

01:28:42.084 --> 01:28:46.008
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's actually a way to, on certain copies of it, to switch out...

01:28:47.089 --> 01:28:54.574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember which of the characters it is, but you can do a code that switches out one of the characters for Sonic for that same sprite.

01:28:54.874 --> 01:28:55.114
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

01:28:56.435 --> 01:29:00.878
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also some of the level music in here.

01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:05.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Different versions of the same music was heard in Sonic Crackers.

01:29:05.781 --> 01:29:10.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, one of the Chaotix builds was labeled as Sonic Crackers 32X.

01:29:14.326 --> 01:29:14.766
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:29:15.066 --> 01:29:15.867
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had a...

01:29:18.134 --> 01:29:18.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks interesting.

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:22.658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those Sonic games I never really got the chance to play, so hopefully it'll come out.

01:29:22.998 --> 01:29:25.641
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know GameTap's been adding 32X games.

01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:27.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's on there, and I just haven't noticed it.

01:29:27.262 --> 01:29:28.083
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be on there.

01:29:28.123 --> 01:29:29.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I love these stages.

01:29:29.944 --> 01:29:31.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but this is a bonus stage we're looking at right now in the studio.

01:29:31.985 --> 01:29:34.185
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a special stage, the Hexagon 3D one.

01:29:34.405 --> 01:29:34.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

01:29:35.285 --> 01:29:47.208
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it's something that you might think is cool, is that the stage setup for this actually made its way into Sonic Advance, something similar to this.

01:29:48.548 --> 01:29:51.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the bonus stage one that made it into Sonic Advance.

01:29:53.749 --> 01:29:55.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you have it.

01:29:56.178 --> 01:29:58.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Knuckles Chaotix, your classic game of the week.

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:01.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out on the Sega 32X if you actually have one.

01:30:02.682 --> 01:30:03.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I have like two.

01:30:04.585 --> 01:30:05.686
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to send one to one of our listeners?

01:30:06.666 --> 01:30:07.587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask.

01:30:08.508 --> 01:30:11.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for this part A of our Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:11.429 --> 01:30:13.651
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been running awfully long here, almost like an hour and a half into it.

01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:14.692
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take a break.

01:30:14.732 --> 01:30:18.414
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:23.978
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:30:24.438 --> 01:30:28.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
