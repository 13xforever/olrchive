00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June 22nd, 2008,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for this Part B of our podcast, our six-year anniversary.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Here doing a show. We started launching our own station over on Live 365, Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,500
The station itself actually launched in like May, but we considered June when it actually started

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
because that was our first live program, starring myself and Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Loki was a special guest that night, but he worked his way up to a promotion

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,000
to being an actual full-time host, and really, it's just like he was a full host the whole time, honestly.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And here we are, so many years later, still doing this little program.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Miggletop is back joining us, Sans Blanket, Sans book. It's almost like he's actually going to participate this evening.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I finished my book.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,500
You did?

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Again, I've already read it.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
What was it? Do you care to share it with us?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's called Hero by Perry Moore.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it? What's it about?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's about a superhero.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's about it. Okay.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's awesome.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Would it make a good video game?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
All right. All right.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But it might be a live action show from what I understand, so yay.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But not like heroes, heroes.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,500
No, because this is better. We wouldn't have a crappy second season.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
All right.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,000
Mmm, nice and spinny face.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've heard of that book. I was actually thinking about picking it up one time.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Then I shall pick it up.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
All right.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I'll actually read it if I pick it up.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We can't hear Shane, so I'm...

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All right.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then shush.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Going over to Andrew as well as joining us tonight.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You've known him as several different names throughout the years.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There was, let's see, 23rd Magus and Drew Nami.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's still here.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
And was 17 when our show started, which makes me feel old.

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
And I just won't leave.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
I was 19, that means.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh, my God.

47
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm still the freshman. When's my promotion?

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought of you the other day.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Hooray. How long ago? Because I might have already been here.

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,000
It was about three days ago when I was at Dimple Records looking at High School Musical 2.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Yeah.

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Anyhow, let's get back into some video game news, shall we, Loki?

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I will not be talking about High School Musical anything.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,500
It's video games, and that's newsworthy.

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
No, it's not.

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:33,500
But there is some other stuff that's a little bit more newsworthy, and it, I guess, now does have singing involved with it.

58
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
But Guitar Hero World Tour.

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,000
There's been some brand new previews being shown off, and especially the brand new instruments.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They showed off the brand new drum controller, which looks pretty awesome, actually.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,500
And some of the new features with it, they'll actually, the pads are a lot quieter.

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Of course, you may remember that the cymbals are a little bit raised up as well.

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,500
And you've got three kind of drums on the bottom, and of course, a kick drum.

64
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
And also, they will be touch sensitive.

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,500
So when you hit them harder, they'll be louder, and so on and so forth.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Some other cool stuff. Also, it's wireless.

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Now, on the guitar, remember last week we talked about a certain leak that happened about there being a touch sensitive portion of the guitar?

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Well, that turns out to be true.

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:41,500
And actually, the, I guess, brand new touch sensitive slider on the neck will allow you to do all sorts of different things.

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
What are you doing?

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Don't mind the music. I'm trying to prep something else for later.

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,500
But they've also got, of course, the standard five buttons as well, and then the whammy bar and that kind of thing.

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
But it will allow you to do, I guess, new bridges and stuff like that.

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
So that's kind of cool.

76
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
And of course, the usual accelerometer and that sort of thing.

77
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Plus, the guitar just looks kind of neat overall.

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:16,500
And I guess it looks like, yeah, the slider it says will allow you to play with sustained notes by finger sliding up the strip area.

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
And it says it's also going to be used to tap out notes as well.

80
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
So that's kind of cool.

81
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
And they have lots of pictures on all your favorite gaming sites.

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Of course, we did not carry them.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Alright, so what do you think?

84
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I think it's neat. But, you know, I'm afraid, though, that the Hutch senses a portion on the bottom there for like solos and stuff.

85
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
It's enough to make it different than Rock Band.

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
But that's about it.

87
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
You know, if it was buttons, they would have just said, hey, you're ripping off Rock Band.

88
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,500
So, I don't know. I think it's gimmicky.

89
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
That's just my opinion.

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
The guitar looks cool to me, but the drum set totally gave me flashbacks of Drummania.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,500
You know, you move the cymbals out and there you go.

92
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Well, I guess we will see what happens in Guitar Hero.

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I mean, are you guys going to get it?

94
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I have it on order, but I don't know.

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
You might cancel that pre-order?

96
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Yeah, because it's just like, I don't know, I don't play much of Rock Band, so why would I buy another fucking drum set?

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I think it looks cool and it might be fun to play, but I'm kind of getting tired of buying peripherals and shit for games.

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Especially when, you know, they keep changing the guitar up just enough so that you'll have to buy it each year.

99
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Screw it.

100
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Screw it!

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Exactly, and besides, you know, it's neat to do the little like, you know, whammy stuff on there.

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,500
They did mention though with the new guitar there's going to be some pretty cool things you can do with the music editor, which is cool if you're into that.

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
But, I don't know, it's just...

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,500
When you look at all the other games, like there's also the Konami Rock Revolution, they have a music editor in there as well.

105
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,500
You can probably assume that Rock Band 2 also is going to have a music editor in there as well.

106
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
So it's not like it's something that's going to be exclusive to Guitar Hero.

107
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I don't know, it's just... We haven't really heard of anything about Rock Band 2 yet.

108
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
And, to be honest, and we're probably going to cover this a little later...

109
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
E3?

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Well, yeah, E3, but to be honest, we're probably going to cover this a little bit later.

111
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,500
There are some other peripherals out there for the current games that look pretty kick-ass as well.

112
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
And so, I mean, I don't know.

113
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
It's an improvement, but it's, I don't think, enough.

114
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Alright, well, moving on, hopefully this is an improvement. Oh, you want to say something?

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Oh, well, hold on.

116
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Well, hopefully this is an improvement.

117
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,500
A lot of people were very thrilled about the Xbox 360 Blue Dragon game, although it was okay.

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,500
To me, it was like a Super Nintendo RPG on a new system, which isn't necessarily bad, but it did get a little old.

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Anyhow, the game still seems to have a pretty good IP behind it,

120
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,500
because they just announced this week that they are going to be making a Blue Dragon collectible card game.

121
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,500
That's right, it's a partnership with Konami Digital Entertainment, with Mistwalker and the folks that did this,

122
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Viz Media, made the partnership to make this game.

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,500
You might be wondering, Konami? Card game? Well, yeah, look at Yu-Gi-Oh!

124
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,500
And they're very excited over Konami about this game, coming from Yumi Hoshi, who is the card division VP.

125
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I didn't even know Konami had a card division, but there you go.

126
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Quote, we look forward to reaching out to an array of players of all ages and sharing the excitement of the group-oriented role-playing card game Blue Dragon.

127
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,500
It is our expectation that the character designs of esteemed creator Akira Toriyama, combined with the unique gameplay of Blue Dragon,

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
will create countless new fans within the card game community.

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
To which I say, meh.

130
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
But we'll see. Maybe there will be something really cool about it, but I don't know.

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I want to also mention, because I think I mentioned this before,

132
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,500
but the original, I want to say Guitar Freaks 2 and 3 on, I think it was 2 or 3 or 1,

133
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,500
on the original Playstation had a song editor in it as well.

134
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:18,500
So this isn't anything really brand new, but I'm sure people will call it innovative, because they forget so soon.

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Okay. I guess it takes about 10 years before someone forgets about you, so we have a few more years to go before people actually forget about us.

136
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Well, something that, at least a series that I'm pretty sure no one has really forgotten about,

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,500
because Loki brought it up in an earlier part of the show, anyway.

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:43,500
The Raiden series, Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360, hopefully in September, developed by Moss.

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:52,500
And we should be seeing it, actually they're saying in Japan by September, according to Famitsu.

140
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:01,500
It will have new stages and Xbox Live support, you can share your saved games with people,

141
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,500
and it also supports swivel monitors so that you can use it in the portrait position.

142
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
So, you know, a lot of the old shooters used to have that capability, you know.

143
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You could turn your TV on the side and it would work the same way.

144
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:24,500
So, I think this will be cool, although I don't, you know, don't turn your 15 inch, you know, TVs on their end unless you got a proper stand for it or something.

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,500
But, that's pretty cool, I love this game series, it's one of my favorite shooters ever.

146
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
So cool.

147
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Well, I'm looking forward to Raiden as well, I know they have that, it's like a compilation of the Raiden, I forget they call it Raiden something.

148
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,500
But, anyways, some other cool stuff coming out to Xbox 360 pretty soon.

149
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,500
And we've heard about this game for quite a while now, but it's apparently being released, I think next week actually, Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.

150
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Yes, it's coming out on June 25th.

151
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,500
And then there's also another game which is kind of along the same lines as Catan or Carcassonne,

152
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:14,500
but Ticket to Ride is another board game now turned Xbox Live Arcade game that's going to be coming out sometime soon.

153
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I've never heard of this, what's this about?

154
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,500
It's about trains, you actually move, you set up train routes or whatever and whoever has the longest routes you get points and stuff like that.

155
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
It's been pretty popular with people like, you know, those other games.

156
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:38,500
But no word on when that one's coming out, but probably relatively soon, now that it has an Xbox.com page.

157
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Hmm.

158
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Well, I guess we'll see what happens with that.

159
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Oh, and actually the speculation though from Xbox 360 fanboys, that the last time that Xbox pages appeared for unreleased Xbox Live Arcade games,

160
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Frogger 2 and Commando 3, they appeared the very next week.

161
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,500
So, Happy Tree Friends and maybe Ticket to Ride next week, or this week.

162
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Speaking of speculation and the Xbox 360, you remember that big mass of things that leaked last week,

163
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,500
the rumors that were probably taken down by the way the next day, and nobody wants to comment on that whole situation.

164
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,500
One of the games that was revealed in that was Lips, which is a pretty interesting sounding karaoke game,

165
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,500
where you were going to be able to actually put in your own songs and it would actually take out the vocals.

166
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Well, this might make it even cooler. We were kind of joking about this game in part A.

167
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Elite Beat Agents, the team behind Elite Beat Agents was INIS.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
INIS was the company behind Elite Beat Agents.

169
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, what's kind of interesting is a lot of people have been kind of putting pieces together,

170
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:52,500
and then an anonymous tipster showed up on Joystiq, apparently saying that INIS is actually the ones that are developing Lips on the Xbox 360.

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It kind of makes sense because you already knew that they were working on an Xbox 360 game,

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,500
and it was probably going to be music-based. All the pieces are coming together. So, kind of neat.

173
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,500
That just sounds like a game that I recently actually watched a commercial for.

174
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
What's that?

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Coming out in Japan. For the life of me, I'm trying to remember the name of it.

176
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:26,500
But it's a karaoke game, and you can actually program your own music into it, as well as sing along with songs that you can enter into it.

177
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
And it's something band. I want to say...

178
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,500
And it made me think of Degrassi because the name is similar to it, but I'm trying to find the name of it.

179
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
So, give me a second. I'll see if I can't get it.

180
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
It's kind of random. It makes you think of Degrassi.

181
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Well, no. The name looks a lot like it.

182
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,500
There needs to be a game about Degrassi because I watch that show religiously.

183
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
What would you do in a Degrassi game?

184
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Fawn over Marco.

185
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Shut up.

186
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Yes. We'll not be fawning over Marco.

187
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Maybe Guitar Hero World Tour, though.

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Good news, though, and we were kind of worried about this, but like some of the other music games out there,

189
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Guitar Hero 3 downloads will work in Guitar Hero World Tour.

190
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Hooray!

191
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,500
So, you know, if you're worried about downloading all those tracks for Guitar Hero 3,

192
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
only to have them not work in the end of October, fear not.

193
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,500
But if you do have to buy a copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, they will not work in that.

194
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Which I don't understand why, but whatever.

195
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Well, in other rock band related news, Offspring is going to be having some songs coming soon.

196
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
They're supposed to be...

197
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Well, I mean, this week we already got it then Sevenfold songs,

198
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
but Offspring is going to be having...

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:03,500
As soon as my thing goes back to the stupid page, sorry.

200
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
There we go.

201
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Sorry, my computer is deciding that it doesn't want to cooperate.

202
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Fly radio?

203
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Come out and play, self-esteem, gone away, all I want, pretty fly for a white guy, and the kids aren't alright.

204
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,500
So, that's according to Offspring's official website.

205
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,500
So now I'll actually have all I want in the game, and I can pretend I'm playing Crazy Taxi.

206
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Sure.

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
If that's what I want to do.

208
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Sounds like fun.

209
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Yep.

210
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Alright, well what also sounds like fun are these cute little bobbleheads.

211
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,500
They're Halo themed bobbleheads, and they're going to be coming to you at Comic-Con.

212
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
So, you actually...

213
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Oh, I found the name of the band, the thing is Digaso Band.

214
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
It's kind of like Digasi, a little bit, a little bit.

215
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Well, anyway, this comes from the Bungie's weekly update.

216
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Apparently Halo is actually going to be...

217
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,500
The Bungie is actually going to be at Comic-Con, but only in minimal capacity.

218
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:11,500
But there will be Microsoft people there, and apparently they're going to actually have Spartan and Master Chief little bobbleheads that they're going to have.

219
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
And also they're kind of hyping up the Halo novel.

220
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Because, you know, there's some people that are into actually just getting novelizations about the Halo game.

221
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I don't know.

222
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Have you ever read novels based on video games?

223
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
The only ones I ever did were those old, old, old ones by...

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
What was the name? FX9 or something?

225
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Yeah, like Castlevania.

226
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I actually read the novelizations. A lot of the Warcraft and Starcraft novelizations are fairly well written.

227
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I think you can read a lot of that stuff online.

228
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,500
What kind of stories can people expect to hear in the Warcraft novelizations?

229
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Side stories, alternate retellings of stuff like the War of the Ancients, which happens way, way, way before Warcraft III.

230
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:00,500
It's actually become canon now. You see a lot of the characters from those novels in World of Warcraft.

231
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Including, like in Eastern Plaguelands, you see some of the novel characters that they added in updates.

232
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:13,500
And the whole new Sunwell raid is based off the Warcraft manga.

233
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,500
So it's actually fairly deep, if you're interested in such things.

234
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Okay.

235
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Well, I think it's time for us to get to a segment here on Orange Lounge Radio, which we haven't done in a while.

236
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,500
I don't remember the last time we did this segment, actually. It was quite some time ago.

237
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I'm sure over on the wiki, they have it all figured out.

238
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,500
If you want to check out the wiki, it's orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, I want to say it is.

239
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,500
But we're going to bring back an old segment we haven't done in a while in honor of our sixth anniversary, and it's called Listless.

240
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Sorry, I'm just reading this comment in the chat.

241
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,500
SSJ100Matt says, no one will buy the novelization because there's no teabagging in it.

242
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Before I forget, too, I did post a link to that commercial in the chatroom.

243
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It's Digaso Bandbrothers, is what it is.

244
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Alright. Well, let's talk about Listless tonight.

245
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Listless is a game we like to play here on Orange Lounge Radio where we come up with a definitive list of something.

246
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Tonight, that something is going back to our roots, and we're going to take a look.

247
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
DDR is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.

248
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
We're looking at the sixth year of Orange Lounge Radio.

249
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,500
If you remember, Orange Lounge Radio was formed because DarkSoccer, myself, and Loki all actually met playing DDR at the arcade.

250
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I know, crazy, but true. It's how it actually happened.

251
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
We all met through that and decided to start this radio show because of it.

252
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,500
So when we started Orange Lounge Radio, it was about strictly pretty much music-based video games and what was going on at the scene.

253
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Tournaments, you know, all that kind of stuff.

254
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:54,500
So anyhow, tonight we're actually going to sort of look back at that and try to decide, with our scientific Listless process,

255
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
the best Bamani song of the past ten years.

256
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
That could be DDR, 2DX, anything is fair game.

257
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
So here's how it works.

258
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:12,500
All five of us here in studio tonight, that would be myself, DarkSoccer, Loki, Drew, and Miklotov, have all picked their top three, which will compile into a list of fifteen.

259
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Then each one of us will go around and take one song off the list, and that will leave us with a list of ten.

260
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Once we have that list of ten, you in the chatroom get to vote on your number one and your number two picks, and we will come up with a definitive list.

261
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:35,500
And I'm sure, since we have a lot of people that still listen to this show after all this time, who also love Bamani, we're probably going to piss you off with the stuff we left out.

262
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:43,500
But keep in mind, we only had room for three songs on each of our lists over the past ten years, and we can pick whatever the hell we want.

263
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,500
So unfortunately, I need to kill Crystal Waters here, because tonight I'm going to try to play clips from the songs.

264
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,500
For those of you that do not know the Bamani game so well, at least you can feel like you know what we're talking about, so we can play some clips of the songs for you guys.

265
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,500
So, sorry Crystal Waters, you're out tonight. But meantime, we're going to go around and start the list.

266
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
So I'll start with Miklotov. He can go first, since he decided to sleep through part A.

267
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
And what is your number three pick tonight, Miklotov?

268
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Well, assuming my list didn't get changed when I had it to.

269
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
No, everything's fine with the list.

270
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Alright, it is Turning the Motor Over.

271
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:30,500
That's my favorite. Yeah, it's freaking awesome. I don't know how to describe it. The singer guy, Jeff Pugh, is just like being green with his voice.

272
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:39,500
And it's a great song. It just got revived in a home version of 2DX Gold, because it's that awesome.

273
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,500
This one's actually really fun to play, and it's quite cool.

274
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Alright, Shane's number three is Turning the Motor Over. Let's go over to Drew. What is your number three pick tonight?

275
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
My number three pick is Bitmania.

276
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Bitmania. And this was from 2DX 8th Style, if I've done my research right.

277
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
What is it about this song that makes you want to put it on the list?

278
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:18,500
It's old-school, and it's got a very clear vocal part to it. It makes it really good to play, especially when you're playing 8th Style over in Scandia for the first time.

279
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
And this is the first time I've played on an arcade machine.

280
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Alright, there's Drew's number three pick, Bitmania. We'll start with Loki. What's your number three pick?

281
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
My number three pick is Rain of Sorrow, and it's from Max 2.

282
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:40,500
And it was fun. It was like, I don't know, I just like the steps in it. And it just had really fun steps, and it was a catchy song.

283
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Alright, Rain of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick. Let's listen to it for a little bit.

284
00:20:45,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Alright, Rain of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick. You wanna go next, Jamie, or you want me to go?

285
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I can go.

286
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Alright, what do you want?

287
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Brilliant To You OG, from DDR 2nd Mix.

288
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Is your number three pick?

289
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Oh, sorry, my number three?

290
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Yeah.

291
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Yeah, that's my number three.

292
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Alright, Brilliant To You OG Mix.

293
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
And why this song?

294
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,500
It used to be my very favorite, but I have actually changed my mind on my official number one because of the fun factor.

295
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:41,500
So, this one, though, was like the song I played every freaking time I played a 2-second mix, because that was my first one that I actually owned.

296
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Although the first one I played was a 1.5.

297
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Alright.

298
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
It's old school.

299
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,500
My number three pick, I love this song. It's from B-Mania 2DX.

300
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Actually, I wanna say it showed up early in fifth style, but it actually was a full song in sixth style.

301
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Love Is Dreaminess.

302
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
And I love the video.

303
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
The video is so freaking adorable.

304
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
That almost makes the song a little guy with little arms.

305
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.

306
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Alright, so Love Is Dreaminess.

307
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,500
So, so far on the list, turning the motor over, B-Mania, Reign Of Sorrow, Brilliant To You OG Mix, and Love Is Dreaminess.

308
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Shane, what did you pick for number two?

309
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I picked, oops, sorry.

310
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I picked, what did I pick?

311
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Right On Time from Guitar Freak's Drummania, because that was like the first Drummania song I ever played.

312
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
And it was like so freaking good.

313
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah, just the constant having it.

314
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
It's so good.

315
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,500
I didn't even do the chorus. I hate it.

316
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Better?

317
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I think what I was telling Shane is that I called the song The Armbreaker when I got good enough at Drummania to play this one in the intermediate.

318
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,500
It was, yeah.

319
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:09,500
It was all the drumming, it was all on the left side, and then you had to hit your cymbal really on the little splash part, so.

320
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Alright. Andrew, your number two pick.

321
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,500
My number two pick is Caution.

322
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Now why this one? This is like from old school.

323
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Well, it ought to be obvious that I used to follow DDR freestyle, and nothing reminds me of DDR freestyle, like AP style.

324
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
And you have the classic Caution Drop.

325
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,500
That's used to love seeing videos take over.

326
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Can you describe what a Caution Drop is for those that weren't listening to our show when we were doing DDR stuff?

327
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Alright. Caution Drop is one of the classic DDR freestyle moves.

328
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Basically, the freestyler hops onto up and right, and then drops back onto their hands onto down and left.

329
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
So they just kind of slam back down onto the pad.

330
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,500
It's cool when it's done right, but it can hurt you a lot if you do it wrong.

331
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Alright. Caution, also known as, I can probably not pronounce this.

332
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Wongo, Gongo? Or Don't Bother Me, because that's what it was called in Pump It Up, because it's a better game.

333
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Alright, there you have it.

334
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Alright. So, Loki, what was your, I'm getting all mixed up here, trying to juggle like five different screens here.

335
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Loki, what was your number two pick?

336
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,500
My number two pick was Era, the nostril mix, or whatever it is.

337
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
The nostril mix.

338
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
No, it wasn't nostril.

339
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Because it was just a cool song. And it's packed.

340
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
And our live listeners heard this during the break tonight.

341
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Yes.

342
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't know.

343
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Alright, there you have it. Era, the nostril mix. Remember, you guys and Jack...

344
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Actually, I think it was one of the first songs that had the speed change in DDR fourth mix, I want to say.

345
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Yeah.

346
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Well, unless you consider, was it...

347
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Absolute.

348
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,500
No, that was fifth mix. I was thinking...

349
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
.59

350
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,500
No,.59 was also fourth. There is that Love... whatever, I'll remember it. From third mix.

351
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Love This Feelin'?

352
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Yes, Love This Feelin'. That had a speed change.

353
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Thanks, GS68.

354
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
I have a funny story about this song.

355
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Go ahead.

356
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:37,500
It's... I scared Dan one time. I don't know if he remembers this, but the first time I ever beat that song in Seven Key, I screamed.

357
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Because I had been trying for like an hour, doing nothing but playing that song.

358
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,500
And he's like, what's wrong? I beat Era O.

359
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
And he went back to doing what he was doing.

360
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,500
So, that's it.

361
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Alright.

362
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Sorry, I was turning on the lights in the studio.

363
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I can't leave this computer chair for like two seconds.

364
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Alright, Dark Sakura, what would your number two pick be?

365
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,500
My number two pick is Dancer from Beatmania 8th Style.

366
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Beatmania 2DX 8th Style.

367
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
That's not the Beatmania version.

368
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Yeah, it is. This is it. This is the middle of it.

369
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,500
There's an album version of it.

370
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Oh, gotcha.

371
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:42,500
But no, I like that song because you just have people dancing in the background and doing the stupid arm-waving pose and holding up a doll.

372
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,500
The video was the greatest 2DX video they ever made. Period. I don't think they made a better video than Dancer.

373
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Alright.

374
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,500
So Dancer is Jamie's number two pick. Okay, my number two pick. I gotta preface this.

375
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,500
You're gonna hate my number two pick. And I don't care. Screw you.

376
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Because honestly, it's my list of top three.

377
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
And honestly, I can say this was all honesty.

378
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:11,500
If it were not for this song, or more specifically, this band, I would not have been all gaga over Japanese DDR as I was.

379
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,500
This band was an enabler to me for DDR.

380
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Uh oh.

381
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:38,500
And that's why my number two pick is Erotic with Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.

382
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick, my number two pick.

383
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Alright, yes, with the crappy rapping and everything. You just gotta love it. It's so bad.

384
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Alright, um, now we get to the number one picks, right? We have a list of ten.

385
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
So let's add the number ones.

386
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Shane, Mikletov, what is your number one favorite Bimani song of all time?

387
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Um, my number one favorite Bimani song of all time would be Boom Boom Dollar from DDR.

388
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Because it is the first DDR song I ever heard.

389
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,500
And the lyrics cracked me up because I didn't know what was going on because I just heard it on like an internet radio thing I used to listen to.

390
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,500
And so I thought the premise of DDR was you had to hit the arrows for more time.

391
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Because it said, pushing all the buttons more times.

392
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
And now I understand it's kind of true because if you don't hit the arrows, you die.

393
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
But it's not the way I thought.

394
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
And I love this song so much.

395
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Nice. There you have it. Boom Boom Dollar.

396
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Mikletov's number one favorite Bimani song of all time.

397
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Drew, what is your number one most favoritest Bimani song of all time?

398
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,500
It was so hard to pick and I know I'm going to piss off the other old school people.

399
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,500
But I have to say, my number one is Zephyr.

400
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Everything about this song is great.

401
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
It's epic.

402
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,500
The video, the vocals, the strings, the vocals.

403
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
It's a hell of a song.

404
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,500
This song is pretty fucking epic, I will say that.

405
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
It just screams epic.

406
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,500
This is the song that you imagine Itagaki burning things to.

407
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Alright, Loki, your number one favorite Bimani song of all time.

408
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,500
This is probably one of the first songs I ever played.

409
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:30,500
And I have to say, out of all the songs I've played in DDR, I'd say I've probably played this song the most.

410
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:38,500
And it's been in, I would say, probably the most DDR mixes possible.

411
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Dynamite Rave.

412
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
You know, Dynamite Rave is one of those songs that age well.

413
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Because I remember in the beginning of this show, we used to make fun of this song all the freaking time.

414
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Because we were just so annoyed by it, how it showed up everywhere.

415
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,500
But looking back like six years now, this song was actually pretty fun.

416
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Drop E and hump the coin return.

417
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I remember somebody doing a routine to this.

418
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
He was in this room.

419
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Yes, remember the Scat tournament.

420
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Sacramento's cosplaying tournament.

421
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Yes, I forgot everything else.

422
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
It wasn't me that thought of the acronym, okay?

423
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Somebody don't talk anymore.

424
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,500
The Scat is...

425
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Not what you're thinking of.

426
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Alright.

427
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Dark Sakura, your number one favorite Bamani song of all freaking time.

428
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,500
I would have to say that I'm gonna go with Heaven is a 57 metallic gray just because it's so fun.

429
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Isn't that fun?

430
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Although I think it was funny that the original name was just me.

431
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
What, Heaven is a 57 Chevrolet?

432
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Yeah.

433
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
I think they didn't want that.

434
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
They couldn't get licensing on it.

435
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
The steps on EDR are really fun.

436
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I like it in Dance Maniacs.

437
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,500
The reason I like it in Dance Maniacs is because you do the whole knee squirrel and everything.

438
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,500
It has you doing stuff that requires lower body and upper body, so it actually looks a bit more like you're dancing with it.

439
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,500
And it's very swingy. I think it's fun.

440
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,500
And Dance Maniacs is kind of the forgotten Bamani game, sadly, too.

441
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Table Waxing Revolution.

442
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
That and Keyboard Mania are off in a corner crying.

443
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,500
It's all about Dance Maniacs, second.

444
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Dampen.

445
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,500
In Marathon Mode, center.

446
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,500
That's happy right there.

447
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
All right. That just leaves me one more song for the list.

448
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
And no one cares, so bye.

449
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I'm kidding.

450
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
What?

451
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Heart.

452
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Okay.

453
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
And this song, my number one favorite, is also kind of an enabler of sorts.

454
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Because honestly, I found a whole lot of new music because of the game this was in.

455
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
And because of this mix and everything.

456
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Yeah, this song is just my most favorite Bamani song ever, and it's Skulk by Echo Image.

457
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
There it is. Skulk.

458
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,500
All right, so that leaves the list right now as this.

459
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,500
And while I read the list, I'm curious, Chat Room, what did we forget?

460
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
We're going to get a whole lot of that.

461
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
You know what I was almost going to put in it.

462
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,500
What did we forget? Yeah, what songs almost made it for you guys?

463
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Stuff that almost made it in for me was Gatchamanote from Poppin' Music and Lupin the Third.

464
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:08,500
And the one that I was really fighting over, though, was Twinbee and the Gradius Full Speed.

465
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It's hard to have just three, isn't it?

466
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,500
It is, but I had to really think of the ones that I thought were a bit more pivotal to me, so.

467
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Right. For me, I would say songs that were so close yet so far for me.

468
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Probably, and now I'm driving light, V35, Flotation, although nobody likes that song.

469
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Boo!

470
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Shut Up, I Hate You, Thunder from 2DX.

471
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Flotation was good, shut up.

472
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,500
They're like all 2DX songs after those 2DDR songs I have.

473
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Miklotov, what was close for you?

474
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Yeah, I had Rock Beat and Wanda down for my four and five just in case my other three got taken.

475
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Yeah, but I also just realized I really should have put such a feeling, or not such a feeling.

476
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
What was it called?

477
00:33:50,500 --> 00:34:00,500
No, no, it's one from DDR Hottest Party because it really brought back the feeling of DDR for me just the way it sounds.

478
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
It's by Yuichi, so it's pretty good.

479
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I was just going to say I didn't put Love in there, which was like my song on repeat for a long time.

480
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,500
We're getting lots of people in chat saying how could we not have Captain Jack on the list.

481
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Not a one of us named Captain Jack.

482
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Shane says it's because he's dead.

483
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
It's not that, I don't know, you know what?

484
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I have a CD.

485
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,500
The songs were catchy, they just weren't my favorite.

486
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
All Captain Jack says is nice too.

487
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
I grew Charlie Nash says Moonlight Shadow, I love that song.

488
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
That's a good one.

489
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,500
It's an ordinary, or not ordinary world, that's okay, Ghost and Drifting Away for me.

490
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Loki?

491
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,500
I liked, was it Fantasy from Max 2?

492
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,500
No, no, not the Eurobeat one, the other Fantasy.

493
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
The one that was in 2DX 4 style, right?

494
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,500
No, no, not that one, the one that was only in Max 2.

495
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Too many songs named Fantasy.

496
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Yeah, it was cool.

497
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:04,500
And also, I would say probably, cause we gotta, can't forget about guitar freaks, Fire.

498
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Cause that was awesome.

499
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
And End of the Century.

500
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Frisbee says DXY.

501
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Holic, we're getting yelled at for forgetting.

502
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
We do have a taco song in there.

503
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,500
And what was it, you know, we probably like, was it Baquah?

504
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,500
But I, what was the third Korean song that I used to play all the time?

505
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
I love Face.

506
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Drew, quickly?

507
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Oh man, there were so many that I'd forgotten at the last minute.

508
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I'm like, I wanna change my mind on the number one.

509
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
My backups were Legend of Max, Murmur Twins.

510
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Murmur Twins is good.

511
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Jack and Mark Get Busy.

512
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,500
And what was going to be my number one at the last minute, I'm like, oh crap, he's gonna do it anyway.

513
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
LED Something Wonderful.

514
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I have to offer the suggestions that Sauce gave me.

515
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,500
It was Boom Boom Dollar and El Ritmo Tropical, even though we put Boom Boom Dollar in there.

516
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Bobby Black Wolf, our buddy before us here on Sunday Nights on All Games says, what, No Linus?

517
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
I like that song.

518
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
It sounds pretty cool.

519
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
It's hard.

520
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Alright.

521
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
And Cheer Train.

522
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
No, no, no, no, no.

523
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,500
What was the one that had the stick figures doing the hadoken with the heart in the video?

524
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I don't remember.

525
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I love that song and I can't even remember the name of it.

526
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,500
There's a really difficult task ahead of us now and that is we have to reduce this list of 15 to 10.

527
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
This is going to be painful.

528
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
No one take it personally.

529
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Alright.

530
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
It's just a game.

531
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Alright.

532
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Here we go.

533
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Here's the list of stands so far.

534
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Rain of Sorrow, Brilliant To You, OG Mix, Love Is Dreamyness, Right On Time, Caution, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Boom Boom Dollar, Zephyr, Dynamite Rave, Heaven Is A 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

535
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Miklotov, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

536
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
What's the list again?

537
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
You come over here and look.

538
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm not reading it again for our poor radio listeners.

539
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
I totally had it for a second.

540
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,500
You were too damn lazy to take a little effort and think about it.

541
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Oh, I'm taking Caution off there because it was better in Pump.

542
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Oh, Caution.

543
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Same thing in Pump, just a little longer.

544
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Caution has been stricken from the list.

545
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Drew, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

546
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Ah.

547
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Boom Boom Dollar is off the list.

548
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Oh, snap.

549
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Oh, snap.

550
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
But it's on.

551
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
It is on.

552
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Boom Boom Dollar has been stricken from the list.

553
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I think that he just did that so that Shane would go pout.

554
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,500
As Miklotov runs off to pout.

555
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

556
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,500
You know, I just don't like Zephyr.

557
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Oh, you wound me again.

558
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Zephyr is off the list.

559
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Now we're down to 12.

560
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Dark Sakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

561
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,500
I am going to go with...

562
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Take his other song out.

563
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
He's only got one left.

564
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Come on.

565
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Yeah, but it's Bitmania, isn't it?

566
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
No, Bitmania stays in.

567
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
Yeah, Bitmania has to stay.

568
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm sorry.

569
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Shane is trying to conspire to get Drew's final song off the list.

570
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:23,500
I am...

571
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Will you buy me a chocolate?

572
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
No.

573
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
No.

574
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm not taking bribes.

575
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
I'm going to say Reign of Sorrow.

576
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Reign of Sorrow has been stricken from the list.

577
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,500
All right, gosh, that was the one I was going to take.

578
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,500
So we have Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant TU OG Mix,

579
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick,

580
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

581
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I can't believe Erotic survived that round.

582
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Oh, God, this is hard.

583
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
I actually like all these songs.

584
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:08,500
I really like all these songs.

585
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I don't know.

586
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
I'm going to...

587
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Oh, God, I hate to do this.

588
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
I'm going to take out Dynamite Rave.

589
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Sorry, Loki.

590
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
It just was staring me as sore thumb like,

591
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,500
you don't really like this song, Rob.

592
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
All right.

593
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
So we are left with 10, a list of 10.

594
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Here it is.

595
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant TU OG Mix,

596
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Nostal Mix, Dancer,

597
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

598
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
All right.

599
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,500
So there it is in the chat room.

600
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
And if you would send me a private message in chat,

601
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
those of you that are listening live tonight,

602
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
with your number one and your number two picks,

603
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
make sure it's clearly listed,

604
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
or I will assume the first one is your number one pick,

605
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,500
and we will reveal the results of the definitive top three

606
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Bimani songs ever.

607
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
And help me try to remember what the hell that song was to that video.

608
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
While you're at it.

609
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
With the, oh, with the stick figures.

610
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
It had the stick figure doing the heart hadoken.

611
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
I don't remember.

612
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I love that song and I couldn't remember it.

613
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm sorry.

614
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
All right.

615
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Well, we'll get back to gaming news in the meantime.

616
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
And Dark Sakura's going to start us off.

617
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Oh, do I gotta?

618
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
You gotta.

619
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
This is bugging me now.

620
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Rob.

621
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
What?

622
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Nom.

623
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

624
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

625
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
You're hungry or what?

626
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
No, it has to do with Nintendo.

627
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Nintendo has filed a trademark in Japan that's called Nom.

628
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Nom, nom, nom.

629
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Nintendo online magazine.

630
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
N-O-M.

631
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:50,500
And, um, it is, uh, I really,

632
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I guess I don't know what to say about, you know,

633
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
anything other than a Nintendo online magazine.

634
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Um, maybe it's going to be like, well, you know,

635
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Nintendo already publishes a regular magazine in Japan and we haven't,

636
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I think Nintendo, isn't Nintendo Power still in publication?

637
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Yeah.

638
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
So maybe this is just going to be condensed versions of them online.

639
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
You know, like, I guess,

640
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,500
doesn't EGM have their online site now and all these other places do.

641
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,500
So I miss Game Pro because I like pro tips.

642
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I miss Game Pro.

643
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,500
I miss Game Pro TV.

644
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Well, uh, people were saddened earlier this week when, uh,

645
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,500
there was a brand new Wii update to the Wii menu update 3.3,

646
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,500
which nullified the Twilight Princess hack and, uh,

647
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,500
allowed you also to, um, do something with your Miis and the Mii parade and that kind of thing.

648
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Well, a few days later, they had already, um, thwarted the said hack.

649
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,500
And in fact, today they already released a brand new Twilight hack that bypasses their fix.

650
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Go Nintendo!

651
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,500
You might want to call Sony and let them know how that turned out for them too.

652
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
What did the hack do?

653
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,500
What the hack did was it was a buffer overflow.

654
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Um, it altered the name of Apuna and, um,

655
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
allowed basically hackers to change the name.

656
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,500
And so the game was looking for a certain name and it over,

657
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,500
it was too large for what it was supposed to be and it caused it to crash.

658
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
And then they ran their own code on top of that.

659
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,500
So it didn't affect people that already had the homebrew channel installed in their system,

660
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
but now it doesn't even matter anymore.

661
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,500
So, if you're still interested in homebrew or other things,

662
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
um, the brand new Twilight hack has been released.

663
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
So, enjoy.

664
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Hmm.

665
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Do you think, uh, this is going to become an ongoing battle like Sony versus their homebrew people?

666
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Yes, I do.

667
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
All right. Yes, I do.

668
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
All right.

669
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Um, well, you know, last week I got a little angsty over the whole lack of storage space on the Wii.

670
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Well, somebody appears to be doing something about it, kinda, sorta.

671
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
And it has to do with Guitar Hero World Tour.

672
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Um, what's pretty cool about this is that you can actually save songs to a rock archive on an SD card.

673
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,500
You can play songs off the card without even copying them over first.

674
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Meaning that download content will be available to save on an SD card.

675
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Thank you, somebody, for figuring this out. And, uh, it just proves it's possible.

676
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,500
And Nintendo just needs to patch their dang system already to make this happen.

677
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,500
I'm surprised Rock Band didn't do it first.

678
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:50,500
But with, you know, Rock Band coming out for Wii and all the downloadable content that could be there, but isn't.

679
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Yeah.

680
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
All right. Well, that'll be kinda cool.

681
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,500
And I'm happy to see that, uh, the Wii will get to participate in that download content.

682
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,500
So I'm kinda curious how they're gonna incorporate that into the store-thor.

683
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,500
The store-thor? The store, though. That should be, um, interesting.

684
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Kinda curious to see how that's gonna work.

685
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,500
But I guess we'll find out when the game gets a little closer to being out.

686
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Meanwhile, we wanna hear what you have to say.

687
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Mailbagorangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.

688
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,500
And every week Dark Soccer will open up the mailbag, jump on in, and pull out her favorite emails to read to you.

689
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
And she's gonna do that right now.

690
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:31,500
I'm still mad that no one's found me the name of that song.

691
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
Sorry.

692
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
First email!

693
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Comes from Spazzinator.

694
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Hi, everyone! It's called Quick Question, but the letter really isn't anything but, so I'm still gonna read it.

695
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Hi, everyone. I'm hoping to, uh, get your input on an ongoing debate that I'm having with someone.

696
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
The debate is whether or not any online interaction people...

697
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Okay, first of all, almost this person's E's in the first paragraphs are R's, so it's really bizarre.

698
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:11,500
If any online interactions people have had with each other, whether it be MMOs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI or any other online game, for that matter, constitute socializing.

699
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
Yes.

700
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,500
My line of thought is that these online interactions is indeed socializing.

701
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:28,500
I categorize socializing as the interaction between two or more people for non-business AKA fun purposes, regardless of the medium involved, whether it be in-person, online, or whatever.

702
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,500
As long as person A interacts with person B and vice versa, and it's non-business related, it's socializing.

703
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,500
The only limiting factor in online socializing is that you cannot as of yet beat the living snot out of some other people, nor can you have sex with them.

704
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
We're working on that, I'm sure.

705
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
They fake it.

706
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
On both counts.

707
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Those two things, you have to have that in person.

708
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Is this to say that one is better than the other? I don't think so.

709
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,500
In some cases, in-person socializing is not feasible due to distance and whatnot.

710
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:08,500
How many people are really going to travel hundreds if not thousands of miles to socialize and play games with another person when online will suffice, especially with these high-as-hell gas prices?

711
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,500
What is your take on this issue?

712
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I actually do agree that it is socializing.

713
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,500
A community is a community.

714
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Back in the days when I played a fantasy star online blue burst, we had our groups, we were hanging out and chatting about crap while we busted the crap out of things.

715
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,500
I hang out with people on Ragnarok, I hang out with a lot of people online.

716
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,500
It's really just another medium of communication.

717
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:53,500
WoW for me is especially like that because we go around and we're doing our thing in Warcraft, but I'm having more fun just chatting on Ventrilo and all the crazy antics that happen on there, talking to people.

718
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
It's like a party chat.

719
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,500
I'm going to have to make the distinction here.

720
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Talking to other people on a global game scale, like say on your server in WoW or in Final Fantasy, that's not socializing. You're just there.

721
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:26,500
When you get down to the guild level or the IRC channel level, stuff like that, the guild, the party, the channel, whatever it is, that would probably be a social community albeit not a very personal one at first.

722
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,500
But that would be how you define community, as in your smaller guilds, not your entire server.

723
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,500
But other than that, I think it's a perfectly viable form of socializing.

724
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
I have to quote something that Sas just told me.

725
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Some people spend hours talking on the phone, other people spend hours talking in IM. Same difference.

726
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
True.

727
00:47:49,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Especially with a lot of long-distance friendships that technology has allowed us to build. Back in the day, you'd have a pen pal in a faraway place, and that was pretty much it.

728
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,500
But thanks to the internet, you can talk to somebody in a whole other country as easily.

729
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,500
I mean, look at our show. We have people calling us from other countries. It doesn't cost them anything, thanks to Skype.

730
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:18,500
All my family, a lot of my friends are all over the country, and this is how I keep in touch with them.

731
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:28,500
And I think that, in fact, hold on, somebody else, in case you said, okay, fine. Sorry for misquoting you. She said diff, not difference, whatever.

732
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,500
I'm going to look up something, though, so somebody else add to that.

733
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Well, I was just going to say real quick that we've joked plenty of times, you know, or at least I've said this, is that World of Warcraft is just a chat room with a fireball spell.

734
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
You know?

735
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,500
A very bad chat room.

736
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,500
It's fun, no, it's a great game.

737
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Again, on the guild level, it's a very good chat room. In Baron's Chat, it's a very bad chat room.

738
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,500
You just turn off Baron's Chat. That's what I do.

739
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Trade Chat.

740
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
I shouldn't have to.

741
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Trade Chat is the new Baron's Chat, by the way.

742
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
I shouldn't have to.

743
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Going to dictionary.com, which I love, especially for my stupid nutrition class with my really anal teacher. Socialize is defined as taking part in social activities, interacting with others, or to train for a social environment, to prepare for social life, or to conform to, oh, that's socialism, sorry.

744
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,500
But another one listed on here is to associate or mingle sociably with others.

745
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:33,500
It does not say anywhere in any of these dozens of definitions to physically interact.

746
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,500
That's called punching or boinking or slapping.

747
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,500
Nice.

748
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Or staring at them.

749
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,500
Bonk.

750
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:48,500
So by the dictionary, there is no requirement to be in person to socialize.

751
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,500
I believe NintendoManiac64 rejects your analysis.

752
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:58,500
He says BaDictionary.com. It's all about the dictionary now. I'm just kidding.

753
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
WTF ever.

754
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Yeah, Urban Dictionary is the best.

755
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
That's a big freaking whatever.

756
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,500
I name all my WoW characters off of Urban Dictionary.

757
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
You do?

758
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Yes.

759
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Like what?

760
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Well, my main character is called Sassy Pants.

761
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
You know what I still remember?

762
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
What?

763
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Lil Kim.

764
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah.

765
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Yeah, Lil Kim was my Final Fantasy XI character.

766
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,500
Final Fantasy XI.

767
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,500
No, my newest one I just rolled the other night is Drama Llama.

768
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,500
A girl who spits out her drama everywhere like a llama.

769
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
I hate people like that.

770
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
So to conclude this letter.

771
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:36,500
Also, if I may, I would like to give a quick shout out to some people that I didn't get a chance to when I called in last week.

772
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Hello to everyone in the Limit Break Radio link shell on the Odin server on Final Fantasy XI.

773
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
I played on that server for five seconds.

774
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,500
And everyone in the Happy Haven link shell on the Alexander server on Final Fantasy XI.

775
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Especially Digby Reloaded, Jaden, Brina, and Reiku.

776
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
Thanks in advance.

777
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Oh, memories of Final Fantasy XI.

778
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,500
You know, it's too bad Minkolatov ran off to pout because this would be the part where I might say he's trying to get me to play again.

779
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
And I told him no.

780
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
I just can't.

781
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Thinking of playing again makes me want to vomit.

782
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
I can't.

783
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Call of Taku compels you.

784
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
I can't.

785
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
No disrespect to those still playing.

786
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
I just, I can't.

787
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
I'm already playing a good game.

788
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,500
It's like a bad breakup.

789
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,500
To go on with the next email, and this is coming from Robert M.

790
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Glad to see you're all doing well.

791
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Shifting without a clutch.

792
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:34,500
From what I've heard from the press releases for the upcoming Guitar Hero World Tour, AKA GH4.

793
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,500
It will indeed allow you to store, purchase, and download those songs onto your SD cards.

794
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,500
Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.

795
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Here's to hoping more developers are able to do that.

796
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,500
I've also been working quite a bit on Space Invaders Extreme.

797
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Hard to say which invaders are more annoying in multiplayer.

798
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
The mirror shields reflect types officially.

799
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Or the ISB's assault types.

800
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:00,500
And it says this email was brought to you by Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix Home of the Never Ending Story.

801
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Nice.

802
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
That's the best.

803
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,500
By the way, when I was talking about Space Invaders Extreme in part A,

804
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,500
I have yet to play multiplayer because I have no friends with the game.

805
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Except for Loki, but he'll probably never play it with me.

806
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Poor Rob.

807
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,500
Poor me.

808
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Well, this email, this next one comes from someone familiar and near and dear to all of us

809
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
who stayed with me at Fauna Mae last year.

810
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Who?

811
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,500
It's from Kamira.

812
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Ah, yes.

813
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Hey guys, unfortunately I haven't been able to listen to the episodes lately.

814
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,500
Something wrong with podcasts.

815
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Anyway, I just wanted to congratulate you all on six years of pure, unadulterated awesome.

816
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Here's to six more years.

817
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
Take care and I think of you every Sunday.

818
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Yay, thank you.

819
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Thank you.

820
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,500
We miss you.

821
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,500
We miss you.

822
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Come back and visit soon.

823
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,500
And one from Hippolytus.

824
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Some thoughts.

825
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,500
First, Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, yes, you were all geek.

826
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,500
She spent ten minutes talking about D&D and then complained that somebody rightly calls you a geek as if.

827
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,500
No, what we complained about wasn't using geek as a derogatory.

828
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:07,500
So, which actually we very much specified several times over in the last episode.

829
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,500
So, as if.

830
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,500
I realize we left ourselves wide open for a crack like that.

831
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,500
But really what we were saying was not that we had a problem with the fact that he called us a geek,

832
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:28,500
but just the fact that he was being so derogatory about it when it is a flaw of the Nintendo Wii.

833
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
So, STFU, sit down.

834
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
Not you, the guy at Nintendo.

835
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Second, updates on Saturday, really?

836
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Okay.

837
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
Third, Patti LuPone.

838
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:44,500
Dude, it's all about Bernadette Peters if you don't have Ethel Merman.

839
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,500
I think it's criticizing my musical choices.

840
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,500
I just pulled one up in iTunes, okay?

841
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Bernadette Peters was awesome.

842
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,500
She used to be on the Muppet Show all the time.

843
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
I'm sorry.

844
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,500
I actually really, really dig Bernadette Peters.

845
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Okay.

846
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Fourth, import can't decide what to eat now.

847
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Thank you.

848
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Mini review.

849
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
Cookbook for the DS published by Nintendo.

850
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:13,500
You can choose a recipe based on ingredients, source country, difficulty, cooking method, calories, or cooking time.

851
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,500
It will create a shopping list for you, and since the DS is so portable, you can take it to the market with you.

852
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:25,500
I saw that coming out, and I actually was very interested in acquiring it for my DS.

853
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
To continue, awesome features.

854
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,500
The recipe will read aloud all the steps to you so you don't have to look at the DS.

855
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,500
You can go forward and backward in the recipe with voice controls.

856
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Continue, go back, more info.

857
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Really, the only thing that's missing is that, remember how they had that DS cookbook came out in Japan

858
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,500
that had a little thing that plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot that was a magnet

859
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,500
so you could stick it to your fridge while you cook?

860
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
That's pretty cool.

861
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Just to conclude the email, in addition to the wonderful photos and full voiceover,

862
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,500
there are also videos, yes a return of full motion video, to demonstrate difficult concepts or techniques.

863
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,500
In short, this game probably would be a mascot game for Orange Lounge Foodio.

864
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:13,500
This message is brought to you by Y Kitchen, home of the best-intended DS-inspired food.

865
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
I'm getting this game.

866
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,500
Don't worry, mama will fix it.

867
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
I'm getting this game.

868
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,500
No, no, no, no.

869
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Get it, it's already been gotten.

870
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,500
But no, I've been major food whore lately, as in cooking everything.

871
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I made the best beef stew, okay?

872
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
No, someone on this show, a fan of food?

873
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,500
But I mean, I've been cooking a whole lot lately.

874
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
And my beef stew is stupendous.

875
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,500
This is true, she was talking to me about her beef stew for like five minutes before the show started.

876
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Doesn't sound good.

877
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
But she's going to make me some, so I'm okay with it.

878
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Well I'm going to bring you some, I've got tons of it.

879
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Apparently Junami wants to come over to my house and have beef stew.

880
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
Beefs.

881
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
More email.

882
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Mas email.

883
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,500
Do I gotta?

884
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Unless there's no more left.

885
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
There's two more.

886
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:07,500
So I heard you guys mention that this alleged Kenyan should fly the Kenyan flag outside of a Kenyan building in Kenya and throw a gang sign up or something.

887
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
An OLR gang sign or something.

888
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,500
So I thought he might need a little inspiration.

889
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,500
And the guy sent us pictures of him doing a weird OLR inspired gang sign.

890
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Which was awesome.

891
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,500
I know, it's pretty cool, but no, we don't want him to fly the Kenyan, that was Rob wanting to fly the Kenyan flag.

892
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,500
I just wanted a picture in front of that Samara cafe so I could see how shitty it is.

893
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,500
But will you link those pictures in chat so that everybody can learn the OLR gang signs?

894
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
I will, and this came from Paradox Vincent.

895
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Even though we're spreading Paradox Vincent's mug all over our chat room, I'm sure he won't mind.

896
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,500
All pictures you send us become our property, so nyeh.

897
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,500
And by our property, by our property we mean everybody's property.

898
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
That's right.

899
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
It's on the internet.

900
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:56,500
DarkSocker's currently posting those links in chat. For those of you guys not in chat, well, I guess that's incentive to join us next time. Maybe we'll post those in the forums after the show.

901
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
We are not Orange Chicken Radio.

902
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,500
We're not?

903
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Joshy16 says we are Orange Chicken Radio.

904
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,500
But I love Orange- I almost had Orange Chicken for dinner last night.

905
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Oh, it's Cheesecake Factory.

906
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,500
By the way, for those in the studio, and also there's the OLR gang sign right there.

907
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Pretty nice, for those in the studio.

908
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Last email! Dun dun dun! From Dwayne.

909
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Hello, love the show. With the release of Syphon Filter 3 and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror on the Playstation Network, what are the chances that Sony will release a PS3 version of Syphon Filter, the most underrated action game ever?

910
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Also having a PS make my home the playhouse for my nieces and nephews.

911
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,500
I would love to get a Guitar Hero Rock Band game for them to team up on.

912
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:47,500
But the problem is, well, let's just say we are an urban family, not trying to hear Metallica, Def Leppard, or Aerosmith unless it's with Run DMC.

913
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,500
More into Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, and Jay-Z.

914
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Heck, I will take some old Prince, Michael Jackson, or Marvin Gaye. What are the chances of getting an R&B band or DJ Hero?

915
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Thanks, Dwayne. PS, can I get a Fuck You to gas prices?

916
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Well, last I heard, they were working on DJ Hero, so...

917
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
A matter of time, I guess?

918
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Eventually.

919
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:16,500
You can always buy BeatMania 2DX, which did come out on Playstation 2.

920
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,500
I would love a home version of Crackin' DJ so bad.

921
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,500
I'm sorry, didn't MTV try a game like that and fail horribly?

922
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,500
See, personally, I think that they're great because I have Radiohead.

923
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,500
I freaking love Radiohead. The only thing it needs is Blur.

924
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Hi.

925
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,500
Alright. Is that it for e-mail?

926
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Yeah, but speaking of Blur, I was watching some band on the Graham Norton show yesterday.

927
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,500
That's the most I've ever actually watched any significant amount of the show.

928
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:53,500
And I didn't know who they were, but some guy was playing the keyboard and I was like, this is a bad Blur impersonation.

929
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,500
Well, if you want to send us e-mails and get Jamie all nostalgic for her favorite bands,

930
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those e-mails to.

931
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:10,500
Meanwhile, we're one story away from tonight's listless results and the revival of another favorite Orange Lounge radio segment.

932
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Listless results on their way right after one more story. Loki?

933
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:20,500
Yes. In case you're really, really, really lonely or just need something to hump, I guess.

934
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,500
Sega has created a robotic girlfriend for you.

935
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Her name, I guess, is Emma, or Eternal Maiden Actualization, and she is...

936
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,500
She looks like an eyebo.

937
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
Yeah, she looks like an eyebo.

938
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
She looks like an eyebo.

939
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,500
And she stands, I guess.

940
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
I gotta say this, everyone's giggling.

941
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,500
18 inches tall. She can sing, dance, and totally make out with you.

942
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,500
I guess there is a love mode where she'll hug you and kiss nearby humans.

943
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Wow.

944
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,500
She looks like an eyebo.

945
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
That's great.

946
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:08,500
It's apparently 18,000 yen or 166 dollars US if you're actually interested in this, and it's coming out in September in Japan only.

947
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,500
So you gotta import them girlfriends.

948
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,500
So what do we call her? EE for short?

949
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Emma.

950
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
Mm-hmm.

951
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,500
EE.

952
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,500
EE.

953
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,500
Okay.

954
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
She looks like a freakin' eyebo, though.

955
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Whoosh.

956
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Nice.

957
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Whatever.

958
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,500
What's the name of the cooking game that was brought up earlier? A couple people have been asking.

959
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
Um, okay, I have to...

960
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,500
It's Cooking Guy. Can't decide what to eat.

961
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Alright, Darsakko will get on that later.

962
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,500
But for now, we're going to reveal who won tonight's List List.

963
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,500
Hooray.

964
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,500
The top three songs, the definitive list of the best Bomani songs of all time.

965
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,500
Not that there was any controversy in this process at all.

966
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,500
However, it's time to reveal the list.

967
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:09,500
Your number three pick was Bitmania.

968
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
What was your number three pick?

969
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Your number two pick, and this kind of surprised me, was Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.

970
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:34,500
And the number one best Bomani song of all freakin' time as voted by you,

971
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:51,500
in our chatroom based on our list here in studio, was Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove.

972
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,500
Which kind of fits that an Aoki song should take the title.

973
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Well, there you have it.

974
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

975
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Our not controversial at all list.

976
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Alright, Skulk, one point away from being on that list, and lots of them tied there in the back too.

977
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,500
Okay, I have a bone to pick with Skulk.

978
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,500
Uh oh, what's that?

979
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,500
It makes me drive too fast.

980
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,500
There's nothing wrong with that.

981
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:21,500
Alright, well, it's time for the Skype line, where you can give us a call.

982
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
1-877-GAME-OLR.

983
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,500
But, tonight we have a little twist on the Skype line.

984
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
We know it's an anniversary show.

985
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,500
We know there's a lot of people that want to call in tonight, probably.

986
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,500
At least there's been quite a few people in chat telling me they want to call.

987
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,500
We encourage everybody to call in tonight.

988
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
We'll give a little extra time for that to happen.

989
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,500
But, tonight we're doing something special for the phone calls.

990
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,500
And that is reviving one of our old favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

991
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,500
It's something we like to call Ask Orange Lounge.

992
01:02:51,500 --> 01:03:00,500
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

993
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,500
What will we find out on the sixth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio?

994
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,500
You can call in and ask us a question now.

995
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,500
1-877-GAME-OLR or look us up on Skype.

996
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:20,500
Alright, so tonight, questions only on Skype.

997
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:28,500
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

998
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,500
And yes, I pulled that right off the top of my head.

999
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,500
So, let's go to the first phone call.

1000
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:37,500
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1001
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio. ¿Quien es?

1002
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,500
Okay, we have a broken phone call there.

1003
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,500
Hey, wouldn't you know, a live radio, we're going to get that.

1004
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,500
It would be so fitting that our first phone call would be a broken one.

1005
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
Please make sure you test your connection first.

1006
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,500
It's echo123 if you'd like to test your Skype.

1007
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,500
You know what else we do need to do at some point?

1008
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,500
What's that? Play old bumpers.

1009
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,500
Okay, we'll do that before the night is over.

1010
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,500
Get up, get up, get busy, busy before the night is over.

1011
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,500
Alright, we have a call and this is a frequent caller, so I know this connection works.

1012
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1013
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,500
It's GS68.

1014
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Hello, GS68. How are you?

1015
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Alright, I have a question for Junami.

1016
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
Have a piece of cake first. It is our sixth anniversary.

1017
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,500
There's a cake.

1018
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,500
The cake is a lie.

1019
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,500
Wait, you have to say-

1020
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
No.

1021
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
No, you have to say nom nom nom because you're eating cake.

1022
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
Nom nom, Nintendo official, whatever.

1023
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,500
Alright, there you go. What is your question for Junami tonight?

1024
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Have you continued playing La Milana or did you give up on it?

1025
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,500
I haven't had much time to play La Milana, but I will get into it.

1026
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:43,500
It's Nintendo hard, it's Battletoads hard, so I may get into it once I'm finished playing Hellgate for a while.

1027
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,500
It gets easier later on.

1028
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:51,500
I think as far as my Battletoads hard games go, I may start with I want to be the guy.

1029
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,500
I want to be the guy that's just retarded.

1030
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Apples don't fall up.

1031
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
They're more like giant cherries.

1032
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Exactly.

1033
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Alright, GS68, thank you for the question. Enjoy your cake!

1034
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,500
Thanks.

1035
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR, your username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1036
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:14,500
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

1037
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,500
Yes, we're going to go there.

1038
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Apparently, just in time for brand new homebrew, a brand new program has just come out called the Wii Braider.

1039
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,500
Can you guess what it does?

1040
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,500
I don't know. I will think about that during this call.

1041
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,500
Hold on. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1042
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,500
Hi, this is Spaznator.

1043
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,500
Spaznator, what's on your mind? What's your question tonight for us?

1044
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Oh, wait first. Hold on, hold on.

1045
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,500
Wait, wait Spaznator. You have to enjoy the cake. Nom nom nom.

1046
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Nom nom nom.

1047
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Alright, there you go. What's your question for us tonight?

1048
01:05:47,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Yeah, I was wondering, just off the top of your head, do you know if there's any chance in hell that WoW will be coming to either the PS3 or to the F360?

1049
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:04,500
Don't count on it, sir. This is a rumor that comes up often.

1050
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,500
And you know, we have of course nothing official to back this up, but here's the thing.

1051
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,500
WoW has sold millions and millions and millions of copies as it is on the PC.

1052
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:19,500
And I think Blizzard realizes that most people that own consoles also own PCs somewhere in their home, so there really wouldn't be a lot of crossover potential.

1053
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:34,500
Plus, I think they probably look at games that, you know, came out like Final Fantasy XI, which is a really weird analogy to use because Final Fantasy XI was originally developed for the PlayStation 2 and that's how a lot of people in Japan play it, but damn, I cannot play that game unless it's on a PC.

1054
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:41,500
It's kind of hard to port a PC game to a console, especially when you consider, you know, how many different things there are to do.

1055
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:48,500
And while the, you know, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 can take, or PlayStation 3, excuse me, can take keyboards, not a lot of people have that elaborate setup.

1056
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:52,500
And I think for your game to succeed, you have to keep it simple to the console basics.

1057
01:06:52,500 --> 01:07:01,500
Now, here's the other thing, though. Would a WoW spinoff game like an arcade game or something else in the Warcraft universe be counted out for console?

1058
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:10,500
Not necessarily. Look at Starcraft Ghost, even though that was cancelled. Something along those lines, I would say, is a much bigger possibility than actually seeing WoW itself on consoles.

1059
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:16,500
Look at Champions of Norrath. That was an EverQuiz spinoff. That worked fairly well.

1060
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Except not a lot of people seem to play it for whatever reason.

1061
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:26,500
Now, Warcraft 2, I mean, or World of Warcraft 2, I should more accurately say, if that ever comes out, who knows? Maybe something that's co-developed for consoles.

1062
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:35,500
But honestly, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Blizzard has the biggest MMO in the world ten times over other competition. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1063
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:48,500
MMOs don't really work for consoles. I mean, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online and its sequels and Final Fantasy XI, name a successful console MMO in the States.

1064
01:07:48,500 --> 01:08:03,500
Yeah, I can't think of any. The only two I ever played was Final Fantasy XI and the console version of EverQuest, which came out for the PS2, but I thought the PS2 version of EverQuest was kind of crappy, though.

1065
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:10,500
I don't know a lot of people that play Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, but Final Fantasy XI in Japan is huge on consoles.

1066
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,500
And I know a lot of people hear the play it. It's probably the most successful console MMO.

1067
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,500
But anyway, Spaznator, we gotta go so we can get some more questions, but thanks for your question. Enjoy your cake.

1068
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,500
Sure, thanks.

1069
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,500
Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

1070
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,500
So, Wii and vibrator thing?

1071
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:36,500
Yeah, Wii-brator. It's just like it sounds. It is a piece of software to turn your Wii remote into a vibrator.

1072
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,500
They have one of this for iPods.

1073
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:47,500
And it says, it's some sort of thing, it says events, vibrator simulation.

1074
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Alright, let's go back to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio. Who's this?

1075
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
Dead Pixels Zone, Raven's Dolphin.

1076
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:01,500
Raven's Dolphin, the one and only, the man, the legend. Raven's Dolphin, please enjoy some cake.

1077
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
I'm enjoying some pie, but that's okay.

1078
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
That's alright. Pie is your preference.

1079
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,500
Alright, Raven's Dolphin, what is your question for us here on OLR tonight?

1080
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:17,500
My question to you is, over the years, you're all gamers, how much do you think you spent over the years of gaming?

1081
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:27,500
I actually added up just my Bemani collection one time, and exceeded a few thousand dollars on just that.

1082
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:36,500
So, I would have to say that I would value my video game collection right now at maybe about 15,000, maybe more?

1083
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,500
Wouldn't you say?

1084
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:44,500
I honestly don't know Raven's Dolphin, and if I were to think about it, I would probably want to go hang myself.

1085
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,500
No, not really, not really. I shouldn't be ashamed of it.

1086
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,500
But, you know, think about the MMOs I've played over the years.

1087
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,500
You know, $15 a month here, $12 a month there.

1088
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:59,500
That alone has been, I spend easily $100 a month, and then during the holidays, new consoles come out even more on games.

1089
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,500
God, it's a lot, Raven's Dolphin.

1090
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:09,500
Easily, probably in the time that we've been doing OLR alone, I would say, what, six years? $10,000. Easily.

1091
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Do consoles and PC hardware count in that?

1092
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
Everything that is gaming.

1093
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:27,500
I'd have to say, aside from games that were lost, I'd say hardware and software, easily $3,000, $4,000 worth of games.

1094
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:35,500
It includes the computers I've built, and the consoles that I've bought, and monthly fees. It's really a lot.

1095
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,500
Loki, you do even dare to answer this question?

1096
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,500
I don't even know. I'm not even going to try to guess.

1097
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,500
It will make me want to cry.

1098
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,500
So, Raven's Dolphin, thank you very much for your call, making us all want to slash our wrists.

1099
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,500
I'm sorry, bye.

1100
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,500
Enjoy your cake.

1101
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:56,500
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, where our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1102
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
We have another call coming in.

1103
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1104
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:06,500
Hello there, OrangeLounge. This is the, well, what? The other one from Sweden.

1105
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Our Swedish listener. We love you. How are you?

1106
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,500
Hello.

1107
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Well, for you, an extra big piece of cake. Enjoy. Nom nom nom.

1108
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:23,500
Um, duh, damn. Just, ow, damn. Just a minute.

1109
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Okay, what was my question?

1110
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:32,500
I think there was a weird, like, intergalactical transmission while he was trying to eat cake there.

1111
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,500
I was getting flashbacks from Max Headroom.

1112
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,500
No, we're in dream cakes in my case.

1113
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Alright, okay, what's your question? I'm sorry.

1114
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:49,500
My question was, Rob, how do you enjoy the end-gaming in World of Warcraft?

1115
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,500
How am I enjoying end-gaming in World of Warcraft?

1116
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:56,500
Great question, because I've been recently going into raids, 25-man raids now, like Serpent Shrine Cavern,

1117
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:05,500
and it's amazing how well-organized a lot of groups are and almost treat it like it's like a job.

1118
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Like, it's amazing, like, you know, you gotta show up on time and you gotta be there,

1119
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,500
and if you don't perform well, then you may not come back the next week,

1120
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,500
and it's fascinating the kind of culture around it.

1121
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:20,500
But as far as some, there certainly isn't a shortage of things to do when you hit level 70 in WoW.

1122
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,500
I think Blizzard's done a pretty good job of having a lot of end-game content,

1123
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,500
and the thing I really like about WoW, especially versus Final Fantasy XI,

1124
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,500
I was playing that, and I don't mean to get the Final Fantasy XI fans to hate me,

1125
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:37,500
because certainly there is a huge sense of accomplishment when you hit a job level 75

1126
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:44,500
in Final Fantasy XI, but it's so much more achievable to actually hit an end-game character in WoW

1127
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,500
and get into that content than it was in Final Fantasy XI.

1128
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,500
I mean, I played for many years Final Fantasy XI, and I got maybe as high as like 56,

1129
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,500
I mean, just because I kept going back and forth between characters and stuff,

1130
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,500
and so I never really got to experience end-game content there,

1131
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,500
so I think WoW found a really good balance.

1132
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
End-game content in Final Fantasy XI.

1133
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:12,500
Well, but here's the other thing. Isn't that that Blizzard is actively pushing people

1134
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:21,500
getting towards the end since Squeenix didn't do that exactly?

1135
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Well, yeah, because Blizzard has kind of reduced the experience caps to make it quicker

1136
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,500
to get to the Burning Crusade content, and the kind of speculation is

1137
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,500
there's going to be kind of an easier way to get to 80 too.

1138
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,500
You're going to be able to make characters that start at level 55 in the new expansion,

1139
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,500
but you have to already have a level 55, but it's still kind of interesting that they're doing that.

1140
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:45,500
But yeah, I love how Blizzard patches their game like all the time with new stuff,

1141
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,500
and to be fair, you know, other MMOs I've played, and I keep going back to Final Fantasy XI,

1142
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
but only because I've played that for so long, they do that too,

1143
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:56,500
but Blizzard, when they have a whole freaking new zone to it with new quests, it's great.

1144
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Well, the reason behind all that motivation, I mean, Rob, you're into end-game now,

1145
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,500
you're raiding, you know how certain encounters are gear checks, and some are skill checks?

1146
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,500
You go to Karazhan nowadays, which is your starting raid.

1147
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,500
Nightbane? That is your motivation check.

1148
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,500
If you keep wiping to Nightbane and you give up, you're not cut out for raiding.

1149
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
You know what's funny? I still haven't fought Nightbane.

1150
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,500
Every time my guild beat it, I wasn't there, but we pretty much have Chara on farm status now.

1151
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,500
I never got to Chara. I stopped raiding at Molten Core.

1152
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Oh, well that's also nice. See, I missed all that stuff.

1153
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:34,500
By the way, thanks for the thing on Nightbane, whatever your name was, since I don't remember.

1154
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
It's Drew.

1155
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Drew, thank you. The reason I'm asking is that a few, like last week or so,

1156
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:52,500
I myself actually dinged 70 on a shaman, troll shaman, so there's my reason for asking, by the way.

1157
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:58,500
Well, Gratz, just take it nice and easy, work on getting your gear up, and you'll be ready for Chara in no time.

1158
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,500
Prepare for a lifetime of healing. That's all I have to say.

1159
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,500
Well, it depends what type he is.

1160
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,500
All right, we've got to let you go though, buddy. We're running over.

1161
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Yeah, thank you.

1162
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,500
Take care.

1163
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,500
Bye-bye.

1164
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,500
Thanks for the question. Enjoy your cake.

1165
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,500
All right, 1877gameolr, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1166
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,500
I would think you'd know that by now, but if you don't, there you have it again.

1167
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Any other last minute stories for us, Loki, while we wait for a few more calls?

1168
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,500
I have one.

1169
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Oh, we got another call, sorry.

1170
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,500
Hi, Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1171
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Hello, you are?

1172
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,500
Hi, this is Gold Banjo.

1173
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Hi, Gold Banjo. Do you have a... Oh, wait, first, we'd like you to have a piece of cake. Here you go.

1174
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
Oh, yummy, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1175
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,500
We'll take it. All right, what's on your mind, Gold Banjo?

1176
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Yeah, I know I did it a little wrong.

1177
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Anyway, speaking of cake and pie and all that good stuff, what's your guys' favorite desserts?

1178
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:54,500
There's the randomness I've come to love and expect out of Orange Launch Radio. Ask Orange Launch. Dark Sakura.

1179
01:15:54,500 --> 01:16:00,500
It was, for the longest time, carrot cake, but I have found something that I think I like just a little bit more,

1180
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:08,500
and that's carrot cake cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory. Stuff is fucking awesome. Amen.

1181
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
I love carrot cake.

1182
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,500
That sounds good. Loki.

1183
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:18,500
My favorite dessert had to have been from my old boss that I worked under at Round Table.

1184
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:24,500
He opened his own restaurant called BJ's, and he had a... it was a 50-50, basically, you know,

1185
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:31,500
orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and stuff like that. It was fucking awesome.

1186
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:35,500
And unfortunately, no other 50-50s have been equal to it, so...

1187
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Well, speaking of BJ's, there's a restaurant chain. I don't know how wide this chain is.

1188
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,500
The Brewery.

1189
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Yeah, the Brewery. It's called BJ's, and they have a dessert there that is definitely my favorite.

1190
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,500
The Pizookie.

1191
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:51,500
It's called the Pizookie. The peanut butter Pizookie is so frickin' good. Oh my God.

1192
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,500
I have sadness about the Pizookie.

1193
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,500
What?

1194
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:59,500
I actually... they... I can't... I've had one twice now, and both times I've gotten violently ill.

1195
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:04,500
Oh, it's a crime, because those things are so frickin' good. I'm sorry. I won't say it.

1196
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,500
I feel your pain. I can't have them anymore because of the low-fat thing.

1197
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,500
So, there you have it. Drew, quickly.

1198
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Alright, cake pie jokes aside, I'd have to say mine's a toss-up between classic root beer float and chocolate soup.

1199
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,500
Ew, that sounds gross.

1200
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:34,500
No, no, chocolate soup... here we are. Chocolate soup is warm chocolate brownie, fudge brownie, topped with chocolate pudding and chocolate whipped cream.

1201
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
Well, you bastard, thanks.

1202
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,500
It's really good.

1203
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:43,500
Thanks for making us all hungry, but no, I'm just kidding. Really quickly, do you have a favorite dessert, Gold Banjo?

1204
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:52,500
Ah, jeez. I should have probably thought of that before I even came on. I don't know. I just like ice cream.

1205
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:59,500
With roclo, please. Now you've learned your lesson. Don't dish it out if you can't take it. No, I'm kidding.

1206
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,500
I know, it's hard when you're put on the spot. We've had six years to practice.

1207
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:07,500
Alright, well, Gold Banjo, enjoy your cake, and we'll put a little ice cream on it for you, and enjoy, and thanks for the question.

1208
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,500
Yep, bye.

1209
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Alright, 1877 game OLR, username on Skyporns, launch radio, Jamie, you had a last minute story.

1210
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,500
I did, and this was once sent to us by Rob with two B's.

1211
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,500
Yes.

1212
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,500
You know, I love Disneyland.

1213
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,500
Me too.

1214
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,500
I love California Adventure.

1215
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,500
I want to go back to Disneyland.

1216
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:28,500
But you know, California Adventure is being given this massive facelift, right?

1217
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,500
Makeover.

1218
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,500
Well, yeah.

1219
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,500
At any rate, because, well, they've lost a lot of money.

1220
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:49,500
So what they've done at Paradise Pier is they've taken a lot of the Midway stuff, and underneath California Screamin', which is the big roller coaster there, they put something called Midway Mania.

1221
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:55,500
Which is, it's, I'm trying to find exactly.

1222
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,500
That's not the new Toy Story ride?

1223
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500
No.

1224
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,500
Oh, I thought it was.

1225
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,500
No, no, it is, sorry, it is the new Toy Story ride.

1226
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,500
Oh, okay.

1227
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,500
Which looks cool.

1228
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:07,500
But it's basically different 3D challenges and mini games and stuff that goes through it.

1229
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,500
So it's pretty cool.

1230
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,500
I was trying to bring the gamer in.

1231
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,500
And that kind of goes along with the Astro Blaster.

1232
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,500
That's like Astro Blaster.

1233
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,500
I love Astro Blaster.

1234
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,500
It's like my second favorite ride at all at Disneyland.

1235
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,500
Remember when it froze?

1236
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
Yes.

1237
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,500
And we kept hitting the target.

1238
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,500
You got like the 10th highest score of the day or something crazy.

1239
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,500
I think I did.

1240
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,500
It was crazy.

1241
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,500
We got another call.

1242
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry.

1243
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,500
I'm sorry to make you wait.

1244
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Kitsune.

1245
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,500
Kitsune.

1246
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,500
I don't think I've ever heard you call in before.

1247
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,500
You're a first time caller, aren't you?

1248
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,500
This is my first time.

1249
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,500
I'm a brand new listener.

1250
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,500
Well, welcome to the program.

1251
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
I'm sorry it's only short calls tonight, but do you have a question?

1252
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
Oh, wait, wait, first.

1253
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,500
I'm so sorry.

1254
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,500
Please enjoy as first time caller an extra large slice of cake.

1255
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Nom, nom, nom.

1256
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,500
Yes, very good.

1257
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,500
All right.

1258
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,500
What's on your mind?

1259
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:54,500
I was walking through IKEA bar the other day and I've been really late on my gaming news.

1260
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,500
I haven't really kept up with it.

1261
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:00,500
And I saw the new Soul Calibur IV ad that's coming out July 31st.

1262
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,500
And I was kind of surprised to see Yoda on there because I hadn't really heard anything

1263
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,500
about it.

1264
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,500
So I was wondering if you guys had heard anything about that.

1265
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,500
Well, there has been quite a bit of news in the States here about what's going on with

1266
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,500
Soul Calibur IV.

1267
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:20,500
We also had Darth Vader in the PS3 version too.

1268
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,500
Yeah, somehow Star Wars is suddenly colliding with Soul Calibur World.

1269
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,500
I don't know what kind of weird licensing is going on there.

1270
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:30,500
But yes, Yoda will be in the Xbox 360 version and Darth Vader will be in the PlayStation

1271
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,500
3 version of Soul Calibur IV.

1272
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Both versions will have the apprentice guy.

1273
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
I don't remember what his name was.

1274
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,500
The secret apprentice from...

1275
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:43,500
Not Donald Trump's apprentice but Darth Vader's apprentice from the Force Unleashed games

1276
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
which are coming out very soon.

1277
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,500
Well, so it's only one character per release for console?

1278
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,500
Well, two if you count the Star Wars guy because he'll be in both.

1279
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:58,500
But here's the other thing is I would speculate that since you kind of cross now into the

1280
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,500
Star Wars territory that in the create your own fighter mode, I bet you you'll be able

1281
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,500
to have a lightsaber and kind of, you know, there'll be a little bit of that in the create

1282
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,500
your fighter mode.

1283
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
But it's probably going to be like an unlockable.

1284
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
That's a prediction not based on fact.

1285
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,500
And we're all praying there won't be another Star Wars Masters of Terikasi.

1286
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,500
Yeah, I'm not sure the Japanese are going to eat that game up because they love Star

1287
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,500
Wars.

1288
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,500
You see it everywhere.

1289
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,500
You even see it in porn stores.

1290
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,500
You know what, and maybe that would explain why because when we saw it announced here,

1291
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,500
the reaction was kind of like, what the hell kind of random pairing is that?

1292
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,500
You know, like, but then you kind of go well, I guess it'll work.

1293
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,500
I guess if spawn can be in it, why not?

1294
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,500
But that makes a lot of sense.

1295
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,500
You know, if it's more of a cultural thing in Japan, they're probably blah, blah, blah,

1296
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,500
you know, goo goo gaga over it, hoping to make up.

1297
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,500
They have a whole island Toys R Us dedicated to it.

1298
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,500
So hoping to make up some of the ground that maybe Soul Calibur 3 lost because it wasn't

1299
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,500
quite as well received, at least over here, although I thought it was still great.

1300
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,500
Mostly because it corrupted memory cards.

1301
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
No, that's only a story.

1302
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,500
Well, kitsune, we got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

1303
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,500
Thank you.

1304
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,500
We always enjoy hearing what's going on across the ocean.

1305
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
We can we can have a good one.

1306
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,500
We're getting more and more Japanese listeners lately, which is kind of neat because we have

1307
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
Akuma JP in the Justin TV chat.

1308
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
We get a few on email once in a while.

1309
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Sweet.

1310
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,500
We love hearing from other people in different parts of the country.

1311
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,500
In fact, I was just thinking of one of our listeners.

1312
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,500
I don't know if he's listening tonight.

1313
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,500
Footy monster the other day because he's in Argentina.

1314
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,500
He was in the chat room today.

1315
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,500
My roommate is in Argentina right now.

1316
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,500
He's in Buenos Aires with his sister and he's been posting updates to live journal.

1317
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
Footy monster is in there right now.

1318
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,500
Is he in chat?

1319
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,500
Yeah.

1320
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,500
Oh, cool.

1321
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
You should tell me some fun things to do in Buenos Aires.

1322
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,500
I can pass along to my roommate.

1323
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,500
You know who else is in chat who's not reading his PMs?

1324
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Bobby Blackwall.

1325
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
Is that is that your not so private message?

1326
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,500
All right.

all right it's a vast fucking conspiracy I'm still hearing myself my friend you

1443
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,780
got to figure out how to make your sound card echo one two three sir

1444
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:30,980
there's actually studies out there that say it's actually pretty much across the

1445
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:34,180
board for guys to have an obsession with boobs no matter if they're gay or

1446

straight so all right let's go to the thanks for making me doubt Jamie we're

1447
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:41,380
going to another phone to me I don't know maybe boobs will get brought up in

1448
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:45,540

1451
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:02,680
and and definitely I'm helping save our show and the evil live 365 you know

1452
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:06,580
almost shut us down you my friend get an extra large piece of cake so here enjoy

1453
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:14,660
some cake yes that was awesome I think the cops are gonna go shut down the

1454
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,700
party at Bobby's house he's having too much fun all right what is your question

1455
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:22,940
for us my friend well you guys have been following music games for a long time

1456
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,180
and I've been listening to you guys for a long time a lot of people probably

1457
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:30,540
don't know that I listen to you guys before I made my show I even listen to

1458
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:35,180
you guys I remember listening to a few live shows before the to-go edition

1459
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:39,820
that's crazy because I honestly thought no one was listening to us I'm sure I'm

1460
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:45,420
just kidding so but I hear you guys you know kind of complaining about the state

1461
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:48,580
of music games sometimes today and you know complaining about certain aspects

1462
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:53,620
of music games so what would a music game have to be and what would it need

1463
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:58,060
to have for you to not complain about it to be made if it was made today what

1464
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:06,220
would a music game have to have or be for us to not bitch about well okay like

1465
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:10,180
if I was gonna go you know it's necessarily routed original from the

1466
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:13,600
kitchen I don't think originally even has to be the case because if you look

1467
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,780
at like DDR and stuff it's been almost the same throughout every release but I

1468
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:23,380
think the thing it's kind of been lost especially with like DDR recently is you

1469
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,620
know with DDR there's when you look at the track list and stuff there's like

1470
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:30,140
songs in there you're like wow that's really cool I want to find out more

1471
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:33,700
about this artist or something like that or oh that's really cool I'm gonna check

1472
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:38,540
out some more music of that genre or something like that but right now the

1473
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:42,620
new releases that come out it's just like oh look this was on beatmania let's

1474
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:46,340
put it in DDR oh hey look there's another game from guitar freaks let's

1475
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:51,220
throw it in DDR oh hey look this is a you know a top 10 song right now on the

1476
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:56,120
pop charts hey let's put it in DDR it's there's no real exploration with the

1477
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,600
music there they're not really they're worried about appealing to the masses

1478
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,740
instead of just let's put some good stuff in there and that's it they should

1479
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:08,860
let us make one I've kind of said this before on the show and I still stand by

1480
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:13,540
this my problem with DDR is that it kind of has slipped into this whole it's just

1481
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:18,020
song song list update of the year and there's not a whole lot I mean they try

1482
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,420
to do some new things with every game but I don't know DDR is starting to feel

1483
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:25,580
a little bit slow to me and I think I've said this before and I still believe

1484
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:29,780
that DDR needs to be rebuilt from the ground up completely and maybe throw a

1485
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:33,860
competitive twist in I liked I even see the last great mix that I thought there

1486
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:38,220
was was backs too because they had you know you would have to play the songs

1487
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:42,420
and then you would earn points or whatever to unlock the next song and it

1488
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:46,740
was at random of what song would be unlocked next and that got people to the

1489
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:49,420
arcade because there's people just sitting there playing on the damn

1490
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:53,580
machine to unlock what song would come out next and no one was spoiled by like

1491
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:57,900
releasing the full song list thank you Konami for every single fucking home

1492
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:02,600
release that you spoil the entire song list for you know there's no surprises

1493
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,140
whatsoever and for God's sake I do not want to play through another fucking

1494
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:14,020
quest mode to unlock shit okay that was never fun ever um I think it did hit the

1495
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:17,180
nail on the head with something I'll get that I know Jamie was talked to um

1496
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:21,900
arcades I think the fact that arcades have gone downhill have sadly made the

1497
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,900
whole music game scene kind of follow and it's just it's tragic there's really

1498
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,220
and there's not a lot that could be helped with that dark soccer I was just

1499
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:34,180
gonna say the versus mode in Disney's rave that was freaking epic and that was

1500
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:39,700
the way to properly do versus battle in a DDR game and bring back keyboard mania

1501
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:44,500
here's the problem and I'm gonna catch some flak for this I love Konami to

1502
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:51,620
death but still every time a competing company comes up with something to

1503
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:58,460
enhance the DDR formula what does kami do konami sues the pants off of them it

1504
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:02,340
happened with on demeero with pump it up happened with rock sore and in the groove

1505
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:08,060
they both added shit to the DDR formula and they are both rejected no they did

1506
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:11,700
not add anything to the formula all you guys rip it off and try to call it their

1507
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,940
own seriously that's all they did oh they made the

1508
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:21,860
new arrows that you have to stop on a lot Oh original Oh holding it Oh mines lame

1509
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:30,740
mines was retarded okay it's retarded that's song list was bad okay but you

1510
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:35,420
know what it's a controversial thing yeah two good songs and in the group all

1511
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:39,780
right all right I gotta ask cuz this phone call is getting to be epic length

1512
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:43,340
but since Bobby you know obviously is a man with well-spoken opinions and has

1513
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:46,420
been listening to the show for a very long time and obviously has been

1514
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:49,700
following music games as well how about a little I what do what do you think

1515
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:53,580
what do you think music games need well I just have to turn it back on me I

1516
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:59,820
didn't have an answer cuz that's what I do I mean my big problem with like you

1517
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:05,920
know the bimani games and stuff was that it relied so much on in-house music you

1518
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,940
know the music tracks and stuff and you know what that's why it didn't work here

1519
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:14,220
well in the States and I mean I remember back you know when I started fine when I

1520
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:18,980
started playing Beatmania on the ps1 I you know had an import console and I

1521
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:23,260
imported the games and stuff back in the 90s I was like man I wish this genre

1522
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:27,380
would come out in the States I wish it would get big in the States and I kept

1523
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:31,300
waiting for something you know other than DDR because I don't want to move my

1524
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:35,860
legs you know and that's why I was really happy to see you know Guitar Hero

1525
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:40,460
finally figure it out that you know hey you got to put in songs people recognize

1526
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:45,900
and so I thought that was really a really great way to do it however I can

1527
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:50,100
see Guitar Hero and rock band possibly becoming the new Madden where it's you

1528
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:56,740
know roster update 2008 here by another set of songs for $60 and now what's

1529
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:59,980
different between this and Madden is that now you're gonna have to buy new

1530
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:04,340
guitars each time or new controllers because you know they make the

1531
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:09,420
controllers better between Guitar Hero 1 & 2 and Guitar Hero 2 & 3 exactly so I

1532
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,980
they just they need to have there needs to be some standardization that's what

1533
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:18,060
would make me not complain is some standardization so I can enjoy all of the

1534
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:23,380
games without having to spend Ravens dolphins question of you know $20,000 on

1535
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:31,580
gaming equipment I was just gonna say we need a US pop and music yes I think you

1536
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:34,420
hit the nail on the head with something kind of in there at least there's

1537
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:38,420
something I drew from it I think the reason why Bahmani didn't succeed as

1538
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:42,580
well outside of DDR in the States is the Konami didn't believe in it and have no

1539
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:46,580
one but themselves to blame they should have tried it a lot sooner and they

1540
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:49,460
could have gotten a piece of this Guitar Hero drum mania craze now they just look

1541
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:53,420
like they're third place with this whole rock revolution thing and and shame on

1542
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:57,980
them for not realizing what they had before you know cuz yeah like you've

1543
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:02,620
been playing beat mania since the early or not really nice lately 90s and beat

1544
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:06,260
mania didn't even make an appearance here in the States until a year and a

1545
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:11,140
half ago with a fairly you know I don't want to say it was a half-assed game but

1546
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:14,580
considering how long it took for it to get here I appreciate they tried some

1547
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,900
different things like having the five key and the seven key in the same game

1548
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:22,900
was cool but you know why Konami didn't believe in it for new songs we got in

1549
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:27,340
that game and the least it was make harder note files for virtual insanity

1550
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:31,180
and they they could if they had a little more faith in it I think we would have

1551
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:36,980
seen something a little more you know involved you know I mean I know they

1552
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:42,100
tried because I remember like my actually my first ever experience with

1553
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:47,580
beat mania was actually at one of the very old III's think maybe 98 Konami

1554
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:52,180
actually had their hip-hop mania arcade machine in the booth because they were

1555
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:56,500
testing it in certain arcades in Chicago all right and I fell in love with it

1556
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,940
then and that's when I went out to go find the ps1 versions you know it

1557
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:04,340
started me off with it people complaining about the whole you know

1558
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:09,740
emulator in symphile market is my first beat mania experience with was BM 98

1559
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:15,180
back in the day and that's when I went out you know hunting for my five key

1560
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:19,180
controller and getting a stack of games you know at network video when they

1561
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:26,020
still sold games and weren't closed but I mean I think you know that also used

1562
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:29,300
to say that you know the companies I think should be looking towards the

1563
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,620
people that are making the emulators and sim files because that right there I

1564
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:37,300
think is going to be your key indicator of what the community wants you know

1565
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:43,300
look to that for inspiration just saying I agree all right well Bobby

1566
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:47,420
there's been a pretty epic phone call but it's it's definitely something

1567
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,060
that's a part of our history we like to look back on and you never know I mean I

1568
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,860
always kind of hope there'll be another beat mania in the u.s. someday I don't

1569
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:57,820
hold my breath over it but now it's kind of gotten to the point where it's like

1570
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:02,260
well if Konami is not going to do it maybe someone else will because music

1571
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:05,740
games have shown they can be successful here in the States but I do agree I hope

1572
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:09,060
they get standardized because I think that's where the it's all gonna fall

1573
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,380
apart is when you have to get one controller for this game one control for

1574
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:15,580
this game the mainstream is just not gonna buy it and then the next sequel

1575
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:18,180
you're gonna have to get a new controller to work do all the stuff

1576
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:21,220
that's in the new sequel and stuff but one you know one last thing you know

1577
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:25,260
about the pop and I do think that Konami really should try bringing that pop and

1578
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:29,580
over here because some people when they come to my apartment I've got my desktop

1579
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:33,540
arcade ASC for pop and music everybody looks at that and they're like what's

1580
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:36,080
that I'm like yeah that's for another music game they're like oh you mean like

1581
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,540
guitar hero and I'm like yeah but you slap the butt balloons and they're like

1582
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:44,460
wow that that sounds cool music is so great pop music might have a problem

1583
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:48,500
coming this stage you got a bit of an image problem but people will see it and

1584
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:51,940
think it's a kid's game but as far as I know I think that pop music actually has

1585
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:56,060
the biggest following in Japan above the other bimani games and that's not to say

1586
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,980
Konami can't put a little effort into American izing the game a little bit and

1587
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:03,860
I realize there's a lot of people who listen to this show that go you know at

1588
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:07,380
the thought of a game getting American eyes but think about it if they how did

1589
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,940
a guitar hero and rock band become so successful because the song lists were

1590
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:15,220
very American I think if pop music could invest you know the development time

1591
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:19,100
into you know maybe re-inventing the interface to be a little more you know

1592
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:24,060
not so childish and getting some good American songs mixed in with the

1593
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:29,900
Japanese favorites it could do well here yep all right Bobby we gotta let you go

1594
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:37,180
just take up can I can I have another piece of cake of course you can by the

1595
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:44,140
way Bobby the cake was a lie all right just kidding I hung up on no Bobby's

1596
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:48,100
awesome all right I will try to get like maybe one more call do you have any

1597
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:53,820
other last-minute stories here before we get to them yeah but I want to talk about

1598
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,180
there's something about Grand Theft Auto and Fox because you remember there is a

1599
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:00,100
movie called Grand Theft Auto so now there can't be a movie called Grand

1600
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:07,620
Theft Auto and Fox can't make a game based off of Grand Theft Auto nice all

1601
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:12,620
right hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this is misty well hello

1602
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:18,980
misty how are you I'm doing good even though I have to open in the morning I'm

1603
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:23,080
still listening I'm sorry to hear about that well here just for you I have a

1604
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:31,460
caffeinated orange piece of cake enjoy awesome nom nom nom oh no mom there you

1605
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:35,960
go she sounds excited all right misty what what question do you have for us

1606
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:42,860
tonight why did scope get screwed over tonight like it did way the hell back in

1607
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:51,140
episode 111 wait why did what I'm sorry I missed it why did what skulk oh why

1608
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:55,100
did skulk get screwed over so bad tonight I you know just not enough not

1609
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:59,000
enough synth pop fans in chat I think voting for scope but you know what else

1610
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,420
is that echo image the band behind that song is just kind of falling off the

1611
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:05,140
planet and I think it's a darn shame because that whole album is just

1612
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:10,540
freaking amazing if you haven't checked it out yeah I know it's it's an

1613
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:16,660
understatement seriously it will it's it's better than dessert if I had a band

1614
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:20,100
I think I'd name it that it's better than dessert I have a lot of great band

1615
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,700
names well misty anything else you want to share with our listeners quickly

1616
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:28,940
before we shut off for the night I can think of even though I bet I'm gonna get

1617
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:33,260
my butt kicked for not asking another another particular question that's all

1618
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:40,300
right you another question you were supposed to ask but that's it so you

1619
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:46,340
wanted me to ask and ask about the fuck show happens when no one expects it to

1620
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:53,420
happen yes like the apocalypse the fuck show but he was one me tonight go on the

1621
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:56,500
the fuck show will sneak up on you eventually here's my problem is that now

1622
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:00,800
I think we've hyped the fuck show too much and like I don't I don't think it's

1623
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,140
gonna be that funny when it happens I think it's one of those things we're

1624
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:07,100
like halfway through part a we're gonna be like okay we need to stop like all

1625
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:11,740
right fuck it but we'll see yeah that's what that

1626
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:15,340
would seem like to me too yeah so I'm a little worried about fuck show but it

1627
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:20,720
will actually happen when Duke Nukem forever comes out we may hold her to

1628
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:24,820
that we may hold her to that all right well misty take care of yourself have a

1629

01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:50,860
playlist they're like well every few songs he's a friend of this I know yeah

1646
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:54,220
and he's also done lost it but I just thought it was interest plus he allows

1647
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:57,780
his me you know he expressed it gives express permission for his music to be

1648
