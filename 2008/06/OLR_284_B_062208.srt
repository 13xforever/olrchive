00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:20,601
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

5
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:46,536
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

6
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:14,793
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

7
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:15,193
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

8
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:15,854
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

9
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But it might be a live action show from what I understand, so yay.

10
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,716
[SPEAKER_10]: But not like Heroes Heroes.

11
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:21,756
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because this is better.

12
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:23,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't have a crappy second season.

13
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:23,797
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

14
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:26,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I sense benefits.

15
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:27,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard of that book.

16
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,079
[SPEAKER_12]: I was actually thinking about picking it up one time.

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I shall pick it up.

18
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,061
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

19
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll actually read it if I pick it up.

20
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:39,384
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't hear Shane, so I'm... All right.

21
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, going over to Andrew as well as joining us tonight.

22
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,835
[SPEAKER_10]: You've known him as several different names throughout the years.

23
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,357
[SPEAKER_10]: There was, let's see, 23rd Magus and Drew Nami.

24
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:52,500
[SPEAKER_10]: He's still here and was 17 when our show started, which makes me feel old.

25
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just won't leave.

26
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:55,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I was 19, that means.

27
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:56,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

28
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:57,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still the freshman.

29
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,385
[SPEAKER_07]: When's my promotion?

30
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought of you the other day.

31
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

32
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:02,748
[SPEAKER_05]: How long ago?

33
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:03,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I might have already been here.

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,573
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about three days ago when I was at Dimple Records looking at High School Musical 2.

35
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:08,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

36
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:14,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's get back into some video game news, shall we, Loki?

37
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:18,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will not be talking about High School Musical anything.

38
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:19,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah!

39
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,163
[SPEAKER_05]: It has video games, and that's newsworthy.

40
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:23,645
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

41
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:29,729
[SPEAKER_08]: But, there is some other stuff that's a little bit more newsworthy, and it...

42
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:31,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero World Tour

43
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:55,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the new features with it, they'll actually, the pads are a lot quieter.

44
00:02:55,992 --> 00:03:00,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you may remember that the cymbals are a little bit raised up as well.

45
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:05,059
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've got three kind of drums on the bottom and of course a kick drum.

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,103
[SPEAKER_08]: And also they will be touch sensitive.

47
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:15,387
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you like hit them harder, it'll be louder and so on and so forth.

48
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:42,664
[SPEAKER_08]: some other cool stuff also it's wireless now on the guitar remember last week we talked about a certain leak that happened about there being a touch sensitive portion of the guitar well that turns out to be true and actually the I guess brand new touch sensitive slider on the neck will allow you to do all sorts of different things what are you doing?

49
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,905
[SPEAKER_10]: don't mind the music I'm trying to prep something else for later

50
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,831
[SPEAKER_08]: www.darksakura.com

51
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:16,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it looks like, yeah, the slider, it says, will allow you to play with sustained notes by finger sliding up the strip area.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says also can be used to tap out notes as well.

53
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:22,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

54
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:27,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have lots of pictures on all your favorite gaming sites.

55
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we did not carry them.

56
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:31,772
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so what do you think?

57
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's neat, but, you know, I...

58
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm afraid, though, that Hutch sends a portion on the bottom there for, like, solos and stuff.

59
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:45,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It's enough to make it different than Rock Band, but that's about it.

60
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:50,360
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if it was Buttons, they would have just said, hey, you're ripping off Rock Band.

61
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

62
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:53,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's gimmicky.

63
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:56,365
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my opinion.

64
00:04:57,126 --> 00:05:01,689
[SPEAKER_14]: The guitar looks cool to me, but the drum set totally gave me flashbacks of Drum Mania.

65
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,612
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you move the cymbals out and there you go.

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess we will see what happens in Guitar Hero.

67
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are you guys going to get it?

68
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:16,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it on order, but I don't know.

69
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You might cancel that pre-order?

70
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:26,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's just like, I don't know, I don't play much of rock bands, so why would I buy another fucking drum set?

71
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:33,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it looks cool, and it might be fun to play, but I'm kind of getting tired of buying peripherals and shit for games.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when, you know, they keep changing the guitar up just enough so that you'll have to buy it each year.

73
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:40,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw it.

74
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:42,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw it!

75
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:48,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, and besides, you know, it's neat to do the little, like, you know, whammy stuff on there.

76
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:57,169
[SPEAKER_08]: They did mention, though, with the new guitar, there's gonna be some pretty cool things you can do with the music editor, which is cool if you're into that, but... I don't know, it's just...

77
00:05:58,769 --> 00:05:59,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

78
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:18,379
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't really heard of anything about Rock Band 2 yet.

79
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, and we're probably going to cover this a little later.

80
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:23,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, E3.

81
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,264
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be honest, we're probably going to cover this a little bit later.

82
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:33,128
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some other peripherals out there for the current games that look pretty kick-ass as well.

83
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, I mean, I don't know.

84
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,252
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an improvement, but I don't think it's enough.

85
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:40,773
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

86
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:41,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, moving on.

87
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:43,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, this is an improvement.

88
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:44,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you want to say something?

89
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:44,595
[SPEAKER_09]: No, absolutely not.

90
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:47,049
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

91
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:02,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yumi Hoshi Yumi Hoshi

92
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,416
[SPEAKER_10]: who is the card division VP.

93
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know Konami had a card division, but there you go.

94
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:42,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote, we look forward to reaching out to an array of players of all ages and sharing the excitement of the group-oriented role-playing card game Blue Dragon.

95
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:50,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It is our expectation that the character designs of esteemed creator Akira Toriyama combined with the unique gameplay of Blue Dragon will create countless new fans within the card game community.

96
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,792
[SPEAKER_10]: To which I say, meh.

97
00:07:54,968 --> 00:08:09,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to also mention, because I think I've mentioned this before, but the original Guitar Freaks 2 and 3 on the original PlayStation had a song editor in it as well.

98
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:16,890
[SPEAKER_08]: So this isn't anything really brand new, but I'm sure people will call it innovative because they forget so soon.

99
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it takes about 10 years before someone forgets about you, so we have a few more years to go before people actually forget about us.

100
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:35,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, something that, at least a series that I'm pretty sure no one has really forgotten about because Loki brought it up in an earlier part of the show anyway.

101
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:43,245
[SPEAKER_14]: The Raiden series, Raiden 4, is coming out on Xbox 360, hopefully in September, developed by Moss.

102
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:46,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And we should be seeing it.

103
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:51,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, they're saying in Japan by September, according to Famitsu.

104
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

105
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:57,916
[SPEAKER_14]: It will have new stages and Xbox Live support.

106
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,679
[SPEAKER_14]: You can share your saved games with people.

107
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,126
[SPEAKER_14]: And it also supports swivel monitors so that you can use it in the portrait position.

108
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:13,647
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, you know, a lot of the old shooters used to have that capability, you know?

109
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,270
[SPEAKER_14]: You could turn your TV on the side and it'd work the same way.

110
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:26,221
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think this would be cool, although I don't, you know, don't turn your 15-inch, you know, TVs on their end unless you got a proper stand for it or something, but that's pretty cool.

111
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I love, I love this game series.

112
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:28,944
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of my favorite shooters ever.

113
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:30,286
[SPEAKER_14]: So cool.

114
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:35,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm looking forward to Raiden as well.

115
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they have that compilation of the Raiden.

116
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget what they call it, Raiden something.

117
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:47,306
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, some other cool stuff coming out to Xbox 360 pretty soon.

118
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:53,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've heard about this game for quite a while now, but it's apparently being released, I think, next week, actually.

119
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.

120
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's coming out on June 25th.

121
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:14,521
[SPEAKER_08]: and then there's also another game which is kind of along the same lines as Catan or Carcassonne but Ticket to Ride is another board game now turned Xbox Live Arcade game that's going to be coming out sometime soon.

122
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of this.

123
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:16,542
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this about?

124
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about trains.

125
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:24,405
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually move, you set up train routes or whatever and whoever has the longest routes you get points and stuff like that.

126
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:27,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been pretty popular that people like, you know,

127
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Those other games.

128
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:37,123
[SPEAKER_08]: But no word on when that one's coming out, but probably relatively soon now that it has an Xbox.com page.

129
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:39,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

130
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess we'll see what happens with that.

131
00:10:44,678 --> 00:11:00,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and actually, the speculation though from Xbox 360 fanboys is that the last time that Xbox pages appeared for unreleased Xbox Live Arcade games, Frogger 2 and Commando 3, they appeared the very next week.

132
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:04,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So, happy tree friends, and maybe take it a ride next week.

133
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:12,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, speaking of speculation and the Xbox 360, you remember that big mass of things that leaked last week?

134
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,850
[SPEAKER_10]: The rumors that were probably taken down, by the way, the next day.

135
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:18,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody wants to comment on that whole situation.

136
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,133
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the games that was revealed in that was Lips.

137
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:22,013
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

138
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:53,038
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of interesting is a lot of people have been kind of putting pieces together and then an anonymous tipster showed up on Joystick apparently saying that Inez is actually the ones that are developing lips on the Xbox 360.

139
00:11:53,999 --> 00:12:00,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it kind of makes sense because you already knew that they were working on an Xbox 360 game and it was probably going to be music-based.

140
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,207
[SPEAKER_10]: All the pieces are coming together.

141
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So, kind of neat.

142
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:12,876
[SPEAKER_14]: That just sounds like a game that I recently actually watched a commercial for that's coming out in Japan.

143
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the life of me, I'm trying to remember the name of it.

144
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:18,080
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a karaoke game.

145
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:26,726
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can actually program your own music into it, as well as sing along with songs that you can enter into it.

146
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's something band-based.

147
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:39,020
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say... It made me think of Degrassi because the name is similar to it, but I'm trying to find the name of it, so give me a second.

148
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll see if I can't get it.

149
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:40,642
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of random.

150
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:41,963
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes you think of Degrassi.

151
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:43,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no, the name looks a lot like it.

152
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:49,230
[SPEAKER_05]: There needs to be a game about Degrassi because I watch that show religiously.

153
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,052
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you do in a Degrassi game?

154
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:52,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Fawn over Marco.

155
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:54,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

156
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:59,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we'll not be fawning over Marco.

157
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Guitar Hero World Tour, though.

158
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:14,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So good news, though, and we were kind of worried about this, but like some of the other music games out there, Guitar Hero 3 downloads will work in Guitar Hero World Tour.

159
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

160
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:16,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh,

161
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why, but whatever

162
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:42,013
[SPEAKER_14]: and other rock band related news.

163
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:46,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Offspring is going to be having some songs coming soon.

164
00:13:48,835 --> 00:14:00,360
[SPEAKER_14]: They're supposed to be... Well, I mean, this week we already got Avenged Sevenfold songs, but Offspring is going to be having... As soon as my thing goes back to the stupid page.

165
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:00,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

166
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:04,917
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

167
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:08,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, my computer is deciding that it doesn't want to cooperate.

168
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:11,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, come out and play.

169
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:12,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Self-esteem gone away.

170
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:13,179
[SPEAKER_14]: All I want.

171
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty fly for a white guy and the kids aren't all right.

172
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:20,340
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's according to Offspring's official website.

173
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I'll actually have all I want in the game and I can pretend I'm playing Crazy Taxi.

174
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:27,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

175
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:29,461
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's what I want to do.

176
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:31,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like fun.

177
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:32,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

178
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:33,745
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

179
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:37,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what also sounds like fun are these cute little bobbleheads.

180
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:42,951
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Halo-themed bobbleheads, and they're going to be coming to you at Comic-Con.

181
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,533
[SPEAKER_10]: So you actually... What?

182
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:47,638
[SPEAKER_13]: DIGASO

183
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:18,469
[SPEAKER_10]: and also they're kind of hyping up the Halo novel because there's some people that are into actually just getting novelizations.

184
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:20,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Warcraft Novelizations

185
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:45,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

186
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's actually fairly deep.

187
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:18,166
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested in such things.

188
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:20,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

189
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:22,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Well!

190
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio

191
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm just reading this comment in the chat.

192
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:57,033
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, No one will buy the novelization because there's no teabagging in it.

193
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:02,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I forget, too, I did post a link to that commercial in the chat room.

194
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,117
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Daigaso Band Brothers is what it is.

195
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:06,037
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

196
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's talk about Listless tonight.

197
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:12,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Listless is a game we like to play here on Orange Lounge Radio where we come up with the definitive list.

198
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,401
[SPEAKER_10]: of something.

199
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:17,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And tonight that something is going back to our roots.

200
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:17,964
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to take a look.

201
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,986
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, DDR is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.

202
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,308
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at the 6th year of Orange Launch Radio.

203
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:29,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you remember, Orange Launch Radio was formed because DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all actually met playing DDR at the arcade.

204
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:31,034
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, crazy but true.

205
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:31,955
[SPEAKER_10]: It's how it actually happened.

206
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:35,358
[SPEAKER_10]: We all met through that and decided to start this radio show because of it.

207
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:42,043
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when we started Orange Launch Radio, it was about strictly pretty much music-based video games and what was going on in the scene.

208
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:42,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Tournaments,

209
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,605
[SPEAKER_10]: and all that kind of stuff.

210
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:58,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyhow, tonight we're actually going to sort of look back at that and try to decide with our scientific listless process the best Bomani song of the past 10 years.

211
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:01,710
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be DDR, 2DX, anything is fair game.

212
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,930
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's how it works.

213
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:11,813
[SPEAKER_10]: All five of us here in studio tonight, that would be myself, DarkSakura, Loki, Drew, and Miklatov have all picked their top three, which will compile into a list of 15.

214
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:13,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

215
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:58,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Who also love Bomani We're probably going to piss you off with the stuff we left out But keep in mind we only had room for three songs on each of our lists over the past ten years And we can pick whatever the hell we want So unfortunately I need to kill Crystal Waters here Because tonight I'm going to try to play clips from the songs For those of you that do not know the Bomani game so well At least you can feel like you know what we're talking about So we can play some clips of the songs for you guys So sorry Crystal Waters, you're out tonight

216
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,794
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

217
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:18,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, um, it is Turning the Motor Over, from Beatmania.

218
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite.

219
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there it is.

220
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's freaking awesome.

221
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know how else to describe it.

222
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:30,133
[SPEAKER_05]: The singer guy, Jeff Kruse, is like, in a dream with his voice.

223
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:33,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And, it's a great song.

224
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:37,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It just got revived in a home version of 2DX Gold, because it's that awesome.

225
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:44,659
[SPEAKER_13]: This one's actually going to be fun to play.

226
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,121
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Shane's number three is Turning the Motor Over.

227
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go over to Drew.

228
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,062
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your number three pick tonight?

229
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,483
[SPEAKER_07]: My number three pick is Bitmania.

230
00:19:56,204 --> 00:20:02,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitmania, and this was from 2DX8thStyle, if I've done my research right.

231
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,778
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it about this song that makes you want to put it on the list?

232
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's old school, and it's got a very clear vocal part to it.

233
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it really good to play, especially in the arcade.

234
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember playing 8th Style over at Scandia for the first time, and this was the first time I played on an arcade machine.

235
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there's Drew's number three pick, Bitmania.

236
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,374
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll start with Loki, what's your number three pick?

237
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:30,318
[SPEAKER_08]: My number three pick is Reign of Sorrow, and it's from Max 2.

238
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was fun, it was like, I don't know, I just like the steps in it.

239
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:39,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just has those fun steps as it catches on.

240
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:44,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Reign of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick, let's listen to it for a little bit.

241
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:52,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Chorus.

242
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:59,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Reign of Sorrow is Loki's number three pick.

243
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:01,397
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go next, Jamie, or do you want me to go?

244
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:02,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I can go.

245
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:03,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what do you want?

246
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:06,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Brilliant to you, OG, from DDR Second Mix.

247
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,479
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your number three pick.

248
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:08,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry, my number three?

249
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

250
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's my number three.

251
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Brilliant to you, OG Mix.

252
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:24,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And why this song?

253
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:31,261
[SPEAKER_14]: It used to be my very favorite, but I had actually changed my mind on my official number one because of the fun factor.

254
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:35,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So this one, though, was like the song I played every freaking time.

255
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:41,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I played a two-second mix because that was my first one that I actually owned.

256
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Although the first one I played was a 1.5.

257
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:45,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

258
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:46,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's old school.

259
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,849
[SPEAKER_10]: My number three pick, I love this song.

260
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:51,691
[SPEAKER_10]: It's from Beatmania 2DX.

261
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:55,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say it showed up early in 5th style, but it actually was a full song in 6th style.

262
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:56,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Love is dreaminess.

263
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:05,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the video.

264
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,366
[SPEAKER_10]: The video is so freaking adorable.

265
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,328
[SPEAKER_10]: It almost makes the song a little guy with little arms.

266
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.

267
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:22,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitmania, Reign of Sorrow, Brilliant 2, OG Mix, and Love is Dreaminess.

268
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane, what did you pick for number two?

269
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:28,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked, sorry, I picked, what did I pick?

270
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on Time from Guitar Freak's Drum Mania because that was like the first Drum Mania song I ever played.

271
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like so freaking good.

272
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:41,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just the constant having it.

273
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:41,872
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.

274
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:44,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even do the chorus.

275
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:44,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it.

276
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:50,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Better?

277
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:58,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what I was telling Shane is that I called the song The Arm Breaker when I got good enough at Drum Mania to play this one in the intermediate.

278
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:02,491
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, yeah.

279
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:09,054
[SPEAKER_14]: It was all the drumming that was all on the left side, and then you had to hit your cymbal really on the little splash part.

280
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:10,835
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

281
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:11,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Andrew, your number two pick.

282
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,738
[SPEAKER_07]: My number two pick is Caution.

283
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:19,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Now why this one?

284
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,086
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like from old school.

285
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:29,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it ought to be obvious that I used to follow DDR freestyle and nothing reminds me of DDR freestyle like 18 style.

286
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have the classic cocky drop.

287
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:45,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you describe what a caution drop is for those that weren't listening to our show when we were doing DDR stuff?

288
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, a caution drop is one of the classic DDR freestyle moves.

289
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the freestyler hops onto up and right and then drops back onto their hands onto down and left.

290
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:02,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So they just kind of slam back down onto the pad.

291
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:06,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool when it's done right, but it can hurt you a lot if you do it wrong.

292
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:17,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Caution, also known as, I can probably not pronounce this, Wongo, Yongo, or Don't Bother Me, because that's what it was called in Pump It Up, because it's a better game.

293
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:20,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you have it.

294
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Loki, what was your... I'm getting all mixed up here.

295
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:27,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to juggle like five different screens here.

296
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what was your number two pick?

297
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:33,885
[SPEAKER_08]: My number two pick was Era, the nostril mix or whatever it is.

298
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:34,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Nostril?

299
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:37,226
[SPEAKER_08]: The nostril mix.

300
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:38,567
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wasn't nostril.

301
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was just a cool song.

302
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a tack.

303
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:45,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And our live listeners heard this during the break tonight.

304
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

305
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

306
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you have it.

307
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Era, the NostalMix.

308
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:53,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, you guys and Jack get to vote.

309
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:57,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think it was one of the first songs that had the speed change in DDR4thMix, I want to say.

310
00:24:58,923 --> 00:24:59,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

311
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:00,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

312
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:07,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unless you consider, was it... Absolute.

313
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,126
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that was 5thMix.

314
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:09,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking... .59.

315
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,908
[SPEAKER_08]: No, .59 was also 4th.

316
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,749
[SPEAKER_08]: There is that love... Whatever, I'll remember it from 3rdMix.

317
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways...

318
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:20,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Love this feeling?

319
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, love this feeling.

320
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:23,605
[SPEAKER_08]: That has to be changed.

321
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:26,207
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a funny story about this song.

322
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:27,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

323
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I scared Dan one time.

324
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:37,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if he remembers this, but the first time I ever beat that song in 7 key, I screamed.

325
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:41,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I had been trying for like an hour, doing nothing but playing that song.

326
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:43,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's like, what's wrong?

327
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:48,166
[SPEAKER_14]: I beat era O. And he went back to doing what he was doing.

328
00:25:52,532 --> 00:26:04,700
[SPEAKER_10]: so that's it alright so that's why I like sorry I was turning on the lights in the studio I can't leave this computer chair for like two seconds alright DarkSakura what would your number two pick be?

329
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:20,991
[SPEAKER_14]: my number two pick is Dancer from Beatmania 8th Style Beatmania 2DX 8th Style that's not the Beatmania version yeah it is Devon this is it

330
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,950
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the middle of it.

331
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:32,774
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an album version of it.

332
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, gotcha.

333
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:42,077
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I like that song because you just have people dancing in the background and doing the stupid arm-waving pose and holding up a doll.

334
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:45,378
[SPEAKER_10]: The video was the greatest 2DX video they ever made, period.

335
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they made a better video than Dancer.

336
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:48,819
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

337
00:26:50,739 --> 00:27:16,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so Dancer is Jamie's number two pick, okay, my number two pick, I gotta preface this, you're gonna hate my number two pick, and I don't care, screw you, because honestly, it's my list of top three, and honestly, I can say this with all honesty, if it were not for this song, or more specifically, this band, I would not have, like, been all, like, gaga over Japanese DDR as I was, like, this song, this song, or this band, was an enabler to me for DDR.

338
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:17,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh.

339
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:24,569
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's why my number two pick is Erotic with Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.

340
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh Nick, please not so quick, my number two pick.

341
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, yes, with the crappy rapping and everything, you just gotta love it so bad.

342
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:48,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, now we get to the number one picks, right?

343
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:51,270
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a list of ten, so let's add the number ones.

344
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:56,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane Miklatov, what is your number one favorite Bomani song of all time?

345
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:20,118
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one favorite Beemani song of all time would be Boom Boom Dollar from DDR because it is the first DDR song I ever heard and the lyrics cracked me up because I didn't know what was going on because I just heard it on like an internet radio thing I used to listen to and so I thought the premise of DDR was you had to hit the arrows for more time because it said pushing all the buttons

346
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:21,259
[SPEAKER_05]: More time.

347
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I understand it's kind of true because if you don't hit the arrows, you die.

348
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not the way I thought.

349
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:29,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love this song so much.

350
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:29,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

351
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:30,405
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

352
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:31,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom Boom Dollar.

353
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:34,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Mikko Top's number one favorite Bomani song of all time.

354
00:28:34,908 --> 00:28:39,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew, what is your number one most favoritest Bomani song of all time?

355
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,593
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so hard to pick.

356
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:44,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I'm going to piss off the other old school people.

357
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:48,278
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have to say my number one is Zephyr.

358
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:54,884
[SPEAKER_06]: This song is great.

359
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's epic.

360
00:28:56,045 --> 00:29:00,927
[SPEAKER_06]: The video, the vocals, the strings, the difficulty.

361
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:03,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hell of a song.

362
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,191
[SPEAKER_10]: This song is pretty fucking epic.

363
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:08,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that.

364
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:10,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It just screams epic.

365
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:13,775
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the song that you imagine Itagaki burning things to.

366
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:22,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Loki, your number one favorite Bomani song of all time.

367
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:31,084
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably one of the first songs I ever played, and I have to say, out of all the songs I've played in DDR, I'd say I've probably played this song the most.

368
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:38,050
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been in, I would say, probably the most DDR mixes possible.

369
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Dynamite Rave.

370
00:29:52,995 --> 00:29:55,317
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Dynamite Rave is one of those songs that age well.

371
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:58,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember in the beginning of this show, we used to make fun of this song all the freaking time.

372
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we were just so annoyed by it, how it showed up everywhere.

373
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:05,324
[SPEAKER_10]: But looking back like six years now, this song was actually pretty fun.

374
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:07,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Drop E and hump the coin return.

375
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:12,633
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, your number one favorite Bomani song of all freaking time.

376
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:43,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have to say that I'm going to go with Heaven is a 57 Metallic Grey just because it's so fun.

377
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:52,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that fun?

378
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:58,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I think it was funny what the original name was supposed to be.

379
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Heaven is a 57 Chevrolet?

380
00:30:59,356 --> 00:30:59,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

381
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:04,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they didn't want the... They couldn't get licensing on it.

382
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:09,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it in dance.

383
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:14,201
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I like it in Dance Maniacs is because you do the whole knee scroll and everything.

384
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:21,367
[SPEAKER_14]: It has you doing stuff that requires lower body and upper body so it actually looks a bit more like you're dancing with it.

385
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:23,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's very swingy.

386
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:24,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's fun.

387
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:26,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's

388
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:30,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Maniacs is kind of the forgotten Bomani game, sadly, too.

389
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:33,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Table Waxing Revolution.

390
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,701
[SPEAKER_10]: That and Keyboard Mania are off in a corner crying.

391
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,082
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about Dance Maniacs second.

392
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:44,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance Maniacs in marathon mode center.

393
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,985
[SPEAKER_14]: That's happy right there.

394
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:48,846
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

395
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:52,608
[SPEAKER_10]: That just leaves me one more song for the list.

396
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:53,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And no one cares, so bye.

397
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:54,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kidding.

398
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:56,891
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

399
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:57,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Heart.

400
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:58,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

401
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:12,183
[SPEAKER_10]: And this song, my number one favorite, is also kind of an enabler of sorts because, honestly, I found a whole lot of new music because of the game this was in and because of this mix and everything.

402
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:18,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this song is just my most favorite Bomani song ever, and it's Skulk by Echo Image.

403
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,561
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is, Skulk.

404
00:32:35,582 --> 00:32:39,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so that leaves the list right now as this.

405
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:43,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And while I read the list, I'm curious, chat room, what did we forget?

406
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:45,793
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get a whole lot of that.

407
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,034
[SPEAKER_14]: I was almost going to put in it.

408
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:48,175
[SPEAKER_10]: What did we forget?

409
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:50,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what songs almost made it for you guys?

410
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:58,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff that almost made it in for me was Gatchamanota from Poppin' Music and Lupin the Third.

411
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:08,907
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one that I was really fighting over, though, was Twinbee and the Gradius Full Speed.

412
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:10,667
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to have just three, isn't it?

413
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:15,389
[SPEAKER_14]: It is, but I had to really think of the ones that I thought were a bit more pivotal to me, so...

414
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:15,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

415
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:26,976
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I would say songs that were so close yet so far for me, probably, and now I'm driving light, V35, Flotation, although nobody likes that song.

416
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:29,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up, I hate you, Thunder from 2DXA Style.

417
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:30,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Flotation was good, shut up.

418
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:34,761
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like all 2DX songs after those 2DDR songs I have.

419
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:36,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov, what was close for you?

420
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Rockbeat and Wanda down for my four and five just in case my other three got taken.

421
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:50,556
[SPEAKER_05]: but I also just realized I really should have put such a feeling or not such a feeling what is it called?

422
00:33:51,336 --> 00:34:08,244
[SPEAKER_05]: one from DDR Hottest Party because it really brought back the feeling of DDR for me just the way it sounds it's by Yuichi so it's pretty good I was just going to say I didn't put love in there which was like my song on repeat for a long time

423
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting lots of people in chat saying how could we not have Captain Jack on the list.

424
00:34:13,488 --> 00:34:15,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a one of us named Captain Jack.

425
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:17,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Shane says it's because he's dead.

426
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:18,451
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that.

427
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:18,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

428
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,432
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

429
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a CD.

430
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,554
[SPEAKER_10]: The songs were catchy.

431
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:23,775
[SPEAKER_10]: They just weren't my favorite.

432
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,157
[SPEAKER_10]: All of Captain Jack's stuff is on iTunes.

433
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:28,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with Charlie Nash says Moonlight Shadow.

434
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:29,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that song.

435
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:29,699
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good one.

436
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Ghosts in Ordinary... Not Ordinary World.

437
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:32,461
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

438
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:35,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Ghosts in Drifting Away for me.

439
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:35,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

440
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:36,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

441
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:42,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked, was it Fantasy from Max 2?

442
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:47,134
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not the Eurobeat one, the other Fantasy.

443
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,396
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that was in 2DX4, right?

444
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,257
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not that one.

445
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:52,899
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that was only in Max 2.

446
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Too many songs named Fantasy.

447
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was cool.

448
00:34:56,262 --> 00:35:02,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, I would say probably, because we can't forget about Guitar Freaks, Fire.

449
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:02,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire.

450
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,183
[SPEAKER_14]: End of the Century, Frisbee says DXY, Holic, Face, Drew,

451
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,676
[SPEAKER_07]: There were so many that I'd forgotten at the last minute.

452
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:34,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to change my mind on the number one.

453
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:44,058
[SPEAKER_07]: My backups were Legend of Max, Murmur Twins, Jack and Mark Get Busy, and what was going to be my number one at the last minute.

454
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:45,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh crap, he's going to do it anyway.

455
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:48,058
[SPEAKER_07]: LED, Something Wonderful.

456
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:52,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to offer the suggestions that Sauce gave me.

457
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:57,380
[SPEAKER_14]: It was Boom Boom Dollar and El Ritmo Tropical, even though we put Boom Boom Dollar in there.

458
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:04,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on Sunday Nights on All Games, says what?

459
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,681
[SPEAKER_10]: No Linus?

460
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:05,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that song.

461
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:06,685
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds pretty cool.

462
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:07,366
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard.

463
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:08,208
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

464
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:09,732
[SPEAKER_10]: and Cheer Train.

465
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:11,312
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no.

466
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:16,195
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the one that had the stick figures doing the Hadouken with the heart in the video?

467
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:16,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

468
00:36:17,296 --> 00:36:19,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that song and I can't remember the name of it.

469
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:24,740
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a very difficult task ahead of us now and that is we have to reduce this list to 15 to 10.

470
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,181
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be painful.

471
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:28,122
[SPEAKER_10]: No one take it personally, alright?

472
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:28,823
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a game.

473
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:31,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here we go.

474
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:34,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the list as it stands so far.

475
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:48,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Reign of Sorrow, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Caution, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Boom Boom Dollars, Zephyr, Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

476
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

477
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,820
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the list again?

478
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom Boom Dollar is off the list.

479
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

480
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:22,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

481
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:23,684
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's on.

482
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:25,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It is on.

483
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:29,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom Boom Dollar has been stricken from the list.

484
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:31,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that he just did that so that Shane would go pout.

485
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,731
[SPEAKER_10]: As Miklatov runs off to pout.

486
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

487
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:43,178
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I just don't like Zephyr.

488
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Zephyr.

489
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,129
[SPEAKER_10]: is off the list.

490
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're down to 12.

491
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,090
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

492
00:37:56,971 --> 00:38:06,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to go with... Yeah, but it's Bitmania, isn't it?

493
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitmania stays in.

494
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Bitmania has to stay.

495
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:11,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

496
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:17,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane is trying to conspire to get Drew's final song off the list.

497
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:25,393
[SPEAKER_13]: I am... Will you buy me a chocolate?

498
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:26,914
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

499
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:27,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not taking bribes.

500
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,057
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna say Reign of Sorrow.

501
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:35,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Rain of Sorrow has been stricken from the list.

502
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:38,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh, that was the one I was going to take.

503
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:49,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Dynamite Rave, Heaven is a 57, Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

504
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe Erotic survived that round.

505
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:57,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, this is hard.

506
00:38:57,477 --> 00:38:58,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually like all these songs.

507
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:00,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like all these songs.

508
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

509
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:15,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna, oh god, I hate to do this.

510
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:17,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna take out Dynamite Rave.

511
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Loki.

512
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:22,746
[SPEAKER_10]: It just was staring me a sore thumb like, you don't really like this song, Rob.

513
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:27,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so we are left with 10, a list of 10.

514
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:28,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is.

515
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:43,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Turning the Motor Over, Bitmania, Brilliant to You OG Mix, Love is Dreaminess, Right on Time, Era Nostal Mix, Dancer, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Heaven is a 57 Metallic Grey, and Skulk.

516
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

517
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

518
00:39:47,205 --> 00:40:05,243
[SPEAKER_10]: So there it is in the chat room, and if you would send me a private message in chat, those of you that are listening live tonight, with your number one and your number two picks, make sure it's clearly listed, or I will assume the first one is your number one pick, and we will reveal the results of the definitive top three Bomani songs ever.

519
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:09,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And help me try to remember what the hell that song was to that video while you're at it.

520
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:13,906
[SPEAKER_14]: It had the stick figure doing the heart hadoken.

521
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:15,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

522
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:16,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that song and I couldn't remember it.

523
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:17,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

524
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:20,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we'll get back to some gaming news in the meantime.

525
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:22,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura's gonna start us off.

526
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, do I gotta?

527
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:24,331
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta.

528
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:25,471
[SPEAKER_14]: This is bugging me now.

529
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:26,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob.

530
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:27,953
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

531
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:29,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Nom.

532
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:31,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Nom nom nom nom nom nom.

533
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:32,555
[SPEAKER_10]: You're hungry or what?

534
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:34,576
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it has to do with Nintendo.

535
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:38,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo has filed a trademark in Japan that's called Nom.

536
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:38,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Nom.

537
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:40,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Nomnomnom.

538
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:41,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo Online Magazine.

539
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:42,540
[SPEAKER_14]: N-O-M.

540
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:47,812
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um... It is, uh...

541
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:55,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I really, I guess I don't know what to say about, you know, anything other than a Nintendo online magazine.

542
00:40:57,168 --> 00:41:07,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's going to be like, well, you know, Nintendo already publishes a regular magazine in Japan and we haven't, I think, is Nintendo Power still in publication?

543
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

544
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,051
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe this is just going to be condensed versions of them online?

545
00:41:13,452 --> 00:41:19,093
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like, I guess, doesn't EGM have their online site now and all these other places do?

546
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:19,373
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

547
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:22,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss GamePro.

548
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I like pro tips.

549
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:28,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss GamePro.

550
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss GamePro TV.

551
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:39,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, people were saddened earlier this week when there was a brand new Wii update to the Wii menu.

552
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:49,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Update 3.3, which nullified the Twilight Princess hack and allowed you also to do something with your Miis and the Mii Parade and that kind of thing.

553
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

554
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:55,667
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

555
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:32,182
[SPEAKER_08]: It altered the name of Apuna and allowed basically hackers to change the name and so the game was looking for a certain name and it was too large for what it was supposed to be and it caused it to crash and then they ran their own code on top of that.

556
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:33,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, I see.

557
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:39,186
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't affect people that already had the homebrew channel installed in their system, but now it doesn't even matter anymore.

558
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:46,030
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're still interested in homebrew or other things, the brand new Twilight hack has been released.

559
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy.

560
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:49,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

561
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:56,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think this is going to become an ongoing battle like Sony versus their homebrew people?

562
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:57,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

563
00:42:58,437 --> 00:42:58,737
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

564
00:42:59,137 --> 00:42:59,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do.

565
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:00,718
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

566
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:03,320
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

567
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:25,572
[SPEAKER_10]: without even copying them over first.

568
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:30,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning that download content will be available to save on an SD card.

569
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:33,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, somebody, for figuring this out.

570
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,975
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just proves it's possible.

571
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:39,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nintendo just needs to patch their dang system already to make this happen.

572
00:43:40,856 --> 00:43:42,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised Rock Band didn't do it first.

573
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:50,219
[SPEAKER_07]: But with, you know, Rock Band coming out for Wii and all the downloadable content that could be there, but isn't.

574
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:51,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

575
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:52,980
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

576
00:43:53,567 --> 00:44:01,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that'll be kind of cool, and I'm happy to see that the Wii will get to participate in that download content, so I'm kind of curious how they're going to incorporate that into the store-thor.

577
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,431
[SPEAKER_10]: The store-thor?

578
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:03,411
[SPEAKER_10]: The store-tho.

579
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:05,072
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be interesting.

580
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still mad that no one spelled me the name of that song.

581
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:07,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

582
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:37,285
[SPEAKER_14]: First email comes from Spazinator.

583
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everyone.

584
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:42,650
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Quick Question, but the letter really is anything but, so I'm still going to read it.

585
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everyone.

586
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:50,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to get your input on an ongoing debate that I'm having with someone.

587
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:54,221
[SPEAKER_14]: The debate is whether or not any online interaction people...

588
00:44:55,502 --> 00:44:59,447
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, most of this person's E's in the first paragraphs are R's, so it's really bizarre.

589
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:11,040
[SPEAKER_14]: If any online interactions people have had with each other, whether it be MMOs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI or any other online game for that matter, constitute socializing.

590
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:41,472
[SPEAKER_14]: My line of thought is that these online interactions is indeed socializing I categorize socializing as the interaction between two or more people for non-business aka fun purposes regardless of the medium involved whether it be in person, online, or whatever as long as person A interacts with person B and vice versa and it's non-business related, it's socializing the only limiting factor in online socializing is that you cannot as of yet beat the living snot out of some other people nor can you have sex with them

591
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,041
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on that, I'm sure.

592
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:44,873
[SPEAKER_07]: On both counts.

593
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:49,308
[SPEAKER_14]: For those two things, you have to have that in person.

594
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this to say that one is better than the other?

595
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:52,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

596
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:56,691
[SPEAKER_14]: In some cases, in-person socializing is not feasible due to distance and whatnot.

597
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:08,815
[SPEAKER_14]: How many people are really going to travel hundreds if not thousands of miles to socialize and play games with another person when online will suffice, especially with these high as hell gas prices?

598
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,456
[SPEAKER_14]: What is your take on this issue?

599
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:14,818
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually do agree that it is socializing...

600
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:17,399
[SPEAKER_14]: A community is a community.

601
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,923
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I've gone on, back in the days when I played, you know, shit, what was that game?

602
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

603
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:27,745
[SPEAKER_14]: We had our groups.

604
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,927
[SPEAKER_14]: We were hanging out and chatting about crap while we busted the crap out of things.

605
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:35,370
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I hang out with people on Ragnarok.

606
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I hang out with a lot of people online.

607
00:46:37,832 --> 00:46:41,614
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really just another medium of communication.

608
00:46:42,054 --> 00:46:56,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow for me is especially that World of Warcraft for me is especially like that because you know we go around you know we're doing our thing in Warcraft but I'm having more fun just chatting on Ventrilo and all the crazy antics that happen on there you know talking to people all right it's like a party chat I'm gonna have to make the distinction here

609
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:10,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking to other people on a global game scale, like say on your server in WoW or in Final Fantasy, that's not socializing.

610
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,215
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just there.

611
00:47:12,936 --> 00:47:20,343
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get down to the guild level or the IRC channel level, stuff like that, the guild, the party, the channel, whatever it is,

612
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:26,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That would probably be a social community, albeit not a very personal one at first.

613
00:47:27,051 --> 00:47:33,414
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would be how you define community, as in your smaller guilds, not your entire server.

614
00:47:34,294 --> 00:47:39,896
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, yeah, I think it's a perfectly viable form of socializing.

615
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to quote something that Sauce just told me.

616
00:47:43,438 --> 00:47:46,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people spend hours talking on the phone, other people spend hours talking in IM.

617
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:47,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Same difference.

618
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,740
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

619
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,380
True.

620
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:55,526
[SPEAKER_10]: What's... Especially with a lot of long-distance friendships that technology have allowed us to build.

621
00:47:56,166 --> 00:48:01,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the day, it was very hard to have... You'd have a pen pal in a faraway place, and that was pretty much it.

622
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:07,549
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks to the internet, you can talk to somebody in a whole other country as easily.

623
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, look at our show.

624
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,970
[SPEAKER_10]: We have people calling us from other countries.

625
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,651
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't cost them anything, thanks to Skype.

626
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:18,072
[SPEAKER_14]: All my family, a lot of my friends, are all over the country, and this is how I keep in touch with them.

627
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:19,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that...

628
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:24,617
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, hold on, somebody else... Okay, she said, okay, fine.

629
00:48:25,297 --> 00:48:26,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry for misquoting you.

630
00:48:26,377 --> 00:48:28,318
[SPEAKER_14]: She said diff, not difference, whatever.

631
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:31,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to look up something, though, so somebody else add to that.

632
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:40,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was just going to say real quick that we've joked plenty of times, or at least I've said this, is that World of Warcraft is just a chat room with a fireball spell.

633
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,661
[SPEAKER_10]: A very bad chat room.

634
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,941
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's a great game.

635
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, on the guild level, it's a very good chat room.

636
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: In Baron's chat, it's a very bad chat room.

637
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,176
[SPEAKER_10]: You just turn off Baron's chat.

638
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:53,936
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I do.

639
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:55,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Trade chat.

640
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:57,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't have to.

641
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Trade chat is the new Baron's chat, by the way.

642
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:00,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I shouldn't have to.

643
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:08,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to dictionary.com, which I love, especially for my stupid nutrition class with my really anal teacher.

644
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:21,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Socialize is defined as taking part in social activities, interacting with others, or to train for a social environment, to prepare for social life, or to conform to... Oh, that's socialism, sorry.

645
00:49:21,984 --> 00:49:26,244
[SPEAKER_14]: But another one listed on here is to associate or mingle sociably with others.

646
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:32,886
[SPEAKER_14]: It does not say anywhere in any of these dozens of definitions to physically interact.

647
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:34,706
[SPEAKER_14]: That's called punching.

648
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:36,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Or boinking.

649
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Or slapping.

650
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:38,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

651
00:49:39,508 --> 00:49:40,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Or staring at them.

652
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:41,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Bonk.

653
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:48,870
[SPEAKER_14]: So by the dictionary, there is no requirement to be in person to socialize.

654
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe Nintendo Maniac 64 rejects your analysis.

655
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,432
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, bah, dictionary.com.

656
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,692
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about the wictionary now.

657
00:49:57,493 --> 00:49:58,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

658
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:00,953
[SPEAKER_14]: WTF ever.

659
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:02,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Urban Dictionary is the best.

660
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:04,776
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a big freaking whatever.

661
00:50:05,016 --> 00:50:07,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I name all my WoW characters off of Urban Dictionary.

662
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,038
[SPEAKER_14]: You do?

663
00:50:08,378 --> 00:50:08,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

664
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:09,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Like what?

665
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my main character is called Sassy Pants.

666
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:13,782
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I still remember?

667
00:50:13,982 --> 00:50:14,182
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

668
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:15,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Lil' Kim.

669
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Lil' Kim was my Final Fantasy XI character.

670
00:50:17,745 --> 00:50:19,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XI.

671
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:22,548
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my newest one I just rolled the other night is Drama Llama.

672
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:26,591
[SPEAKER_10]: A girl who spits out her drama everywhere like a llama.

673
00:50:26,611 --> 00:50:26,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

674
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:27,937
[SPEAKER_14]: I know people like that.

675
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:36,382
[SPEAKER_14]: So to conclude this letter, also, if I may, I would like to give a quick shout out to some people that I didn't get a chance to when I called in last week.

676
00:50:37,023 --> 00:50:42,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello to everyone in the Limit Break Radio link shell on the Odin server on Final Fantasy XI.

677
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:45,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I played on that server for five seconds.

678
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:55,235
[SPEAKER_14]: And everyone in the Happy Haven link shell on the Alexander server on Final Fantasy XI, especially Digby Reloaded, Jaden, Brina, and Reku.

679
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks in advance.

680
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, memories of Final Fantasy XI.

681
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:03,910
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's too bad Minklatov ran off to pout because this would be the part where I might say he's trying to get me to play again.

682
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:04,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I told him no.

683
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:05,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't.

684
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:07,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Thinking of playing again makes me want to vomit.

685
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:08,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.

686
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:09,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Tarku compels you.

687
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:10,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.

688
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:13,722
[SPEAKER_10]: No disrespect to those still playing.

689
00:51:13,762 --> 00:51:14,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I can't.

690
00:51:15,143 --> 00:51:16,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm already playing a good game.

691
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a bad breakup.

692
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:27,659
[SPEAKER_14]: To go on with the next email, and this is coming from Robert M. Glad to see you're all doing well, shifting without a clutch.

693
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:39,451
[SPEAKER_14]: From what I've heard from the press releases for the upcoming Guitar Hero World Tour, aka GH4, it will indeed allow you to store purchased and downloaded songs onto your SD cards.

694
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:40,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.

695
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:44,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's to hoping more developers are able to do that.

696
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:47,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I've also been working quite a bit on Space Invaders Extreme.

697
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:50,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Hard to say which invaders are more annoying in multiplayer.

698
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:54,799
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mirror Shields, Reflect Types Officially, or the ISBs, Assault Types.

699
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,162
[SPEAKER_14]: This email was brought to you by Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix, Home of the Neverending Story.

700
00:52:01,062 --> 00:52:01,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

701
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:02,483
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the best.

702
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:09,465
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, when I was talking about Space Invaders Extreme in Part A, I have yet to play multiplayer because I have no friends with the game.

703
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for Loki, but he'll probably never play it with me.

704
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:13,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Poor Rob.

705
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:14,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor me.

706
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:22,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this email, this next one comes from someone familiar and near and dear to all of us who stayed with me at Faname last year.

707
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:22,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Who?

708
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,590
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from Kimera.

709
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes.

710
00:52:25,831 --> 00:52:26,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

711
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:30,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey guys, unfortunately I haven't been able to listen to the episodes lately.

712
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:31,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Something wrong with podcasts.

713
00:52:31,954 --> 00:52:35,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I just wanted to congratulate you all on six years of pure, unadulterated awesome.

714
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:37,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's to six more years.

715
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:39,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, and I think of you every Sunday.

716
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, thank you.

717
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

718
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:42,461
[SPEAKER_14]: We miss you.

719
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:43,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Come back and visit soon.

720
00:52:44,923 --> 00:52:46,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And one from Hippolytus.

721
00:52:48,337 --> 00:52:48,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Some thoughts.

722
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:52,140
[SPEAKER_14]: First, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, yes, you are all geeks.

723
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,463
[SPEAKER_14]: You spent ten minutes talking about D&D and then complained that somebody rightly calls you a geek, as if.

724
00:52:56,884 --> 00:53:00,426
[SPEAKER_14]: No, what we complained about was him using geek as a derogatory.

725
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:08,293
[SPEAKER_14]: So, which actually we very much specified several times over in the last episode.

726
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,454
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as if...

727
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:28,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize we left ourselves wide open for a crack like that, but really what we were saying was not that we had a problem with the fact that he called us a geek, but just the fact that he was being so derogatory about it when it is a flaw of the Nintendo Wii.

728
00:53:28,243 --> 00:53:29,464
[SPEAKER_10]: So, SDFU, sit down.

729
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Not you, the guy at Nintendo.

730
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:34,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Second, updates on Saturday, really?

731
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:35,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

732
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:37,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Third, Patti LuPone.

733
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, it's all about Bernadette Peters if you don't have Ethel Merman.

734
00:53:44,998 --> 00:53:47,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's criticizing my musical choices.

735
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, I just pulled one up in iTunes, okay?

736
00:53:50,622 --> 00:53:51,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Bernadette Peters was awesome.

737
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:53,104
[SPEAKER_14]: She used to be on The Muppet Show all the time.

738
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I actually really, really dig Bernadette Peters.

739
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fourth.

740
00:54:00,442 --> 00:54:02,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Import can't decide what to eat now.

741
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:04,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

742
00:54:04,424 --> 00:54:05,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Mini review.

743
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:07,345
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cookbook for the DS published by Nintendo.

744
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:13,268
[SPEAKER_14]: You can choose a recipe based on ingredient, source country, difficulty, cooking method, calories, or cooking time.

745
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:19,051
[SPEAKER_14]: It will create a shopping list for you, and since the DS is so portable, you can take it to the market with you.

746
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that coming out, and I actually was very interested in

747
00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:23,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I want this.

748
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Acquiring that from IP or DS.

749
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,555
[SPEAKER_14]: To continue, awesome features.

750
00:54:27,915 --> 00:54:31,677
[SPEAKER_14]: The recipe will read aloud all the steps to you so you don't have to look at the DS.

751
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:34,819
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go forward and backward in the recipe with the voice controls.

752
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:36,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Continue, go back, more info.

753
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:46,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, the only thing that's missing is that, remember how they had that DS cookbook that came out in Japan that had a little thing that plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot that was a magnet so you could stick it to your fridge while you cook?

754
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:48,546
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

755
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:50,627
[SPEAKER_14]: But just to conclude the email...

756
00:54:53,587 --> 00:55:01,150
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to the wonderful photos and full voiceover, there are also videos, yes, a return of full motion video, to demonstrate difficult concepts or techniques.

757
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:05,472
[SPEAKER_14]: In short, this game probably would be a mascot game for Orange Lounge Foodio.

758
00:55:06,392 --> 00:55:11,895
[SPEAKER_14]: This message is brought to you by Y Kitchen, home of the best Nintendo DS inspired food.

759
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:15,336
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this game.

760
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:16,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

761
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:18,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this game.

762
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:19,097
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no.

763
00:55:19,117 --> 00:55:19,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it.

764
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:20,218
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already been gotten.

765
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,641
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I've been major food whore lately, as in cooking everything.

766
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I made the best beef stew, okay?

767
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:30,522
[SPEAKER_10]: No, someone on this show a fan of food?

768
00:55:31,482 --> 00:55:33,843
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, I've been cooking a whole lot lately.

769
00:55:34,603 --> 00:55:36,424
[SPEAKER_14]: And my beef stew is stupendous.

770
00:55:36,524 --> 00:55:37,004
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true.

771
00:55:37,064 --> 00:55:40,225
[SPEAKER_10]: She was talking to me about her beef stew for like five minutes before the show started.

772
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:41,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't that sound good?

773
00:55:41,645 --> 00:55:43,426
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's going to make me some, so I'm okay with it.

774
00:55:43,446 --> 00:55:44,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm going to bring you some.

775
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:45,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got tons of it.

776
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Woohoo!

777
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:50,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, Junami wants to come over to my house and have beef stew.

778
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:52,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Beefs.

779
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,661
[SPEAKER_10]: More email.

780
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:54,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Moss email.

781
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:55,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I gotta?

782
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless there's no more left.

783
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:57,881
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two more.

784
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:07,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So I heard you guys mention that this alleged Kenyan should fly the Kenyan flag outside of the Kenyan building in Kenya and throw a gang sign up or something.

785
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:09,649
[SPEAKER_14]: An OLR gang sign or something.

786
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:12,030
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought he might need a little inspiration.

787
00:56:12,771 --> 00:56:16,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And the guy sent us pictures of him doing a weird OLR-inspired gang sign.

788
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:17,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Which was awesome.

789
00:56:18,014 --> 00:56:18,355
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

790
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:18,955
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty cool.

791
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:22,618
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, we don't want him to fly the Kenyan... What was Rob wanting to fly the Kenyan flag?

792
00:56:23,038 --> 00:56:26,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted a picture in front of that Samara Cafe so I could see how shitty it is.

793
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:31,123
[SPEAKER_10]: But will you link those pictures in chat so everybody can learn the OLR gang signs?

794
00:56:31,483 --> 00:56:33,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I will, and this came from ParadoxVincent.

795
00:56:33,404 --> 00:56:37,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though we're spreading ParadoxVincent's mug all over our chat room, I'm sure he won't mind.

796
00:56:38,247 --> 00:56:40,389
[SPEAKER_10]: All pictures you send us become our property, so nah.

797
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,991
[SPEAKER_10]: By our property, we mean everybody's property.

798
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:45,592
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

799
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:47,553
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the internet!

800
00:56:48,995 --> 00:56:51,035
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is currently posting those links in chat.

801
00:56:51,435 --> 00:56:55,536
[SPEAKER_10]: For those of you guys not in chat, well, I guess that's incentive to join us next time.

802
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:56,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll post this on the forums after the show.

803
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:58,117
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not Orange Chicken Radio.

804
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:00,297
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not?

805
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Joshy16 says we're Orange Chicken Radio.

806
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:05,198
[SPEAKER_14]: But I love Orange... I almost had Orange Chicken for dinner last night.

807
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:06,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's Cheesecake Factory.

808
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,619
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, for those in the studio, and also, there's the OLR gang sign right there.

809
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty nice for those in the studio.

810
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:14,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Last email!

811
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Dun-dun-dun from Dwayne.

812
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:18,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, love the show.

813
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:28,987
[SPEAKER_14]: With the release of Syphon Filter 3 and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror on the PlayStation Network, what are the chances that Sony will release a PS3 version of Syphon Filter, the most underrated action game ever?

814
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:34,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Also having a PS make my home the playhouse for my nieces and nephews.

815
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:39,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to get a Guitar Hero rock band game for them to team up on.

816
00:57:39,954 --> 00:57:47,640
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is, well, let's just say we are an urban family not trying to hear Metallica, Def Leppard, or Aerosmith unless it's with Run DMC.

817
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,403
[SPEAKER_14]: More into Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, and Jay-Z.

818
00:57:52,424 --> 00:57:55,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Heck, I will take some old Prince, Michael Jackson, or Marvin Gaye.

819
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,808
[SPEAKER_14]: What are the chances of getting an R&B band or DJ Hero?

820
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:58,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Dwayne.

821
00:57:59,009 --> 00:57:59,249
[SPEAKER_14]: P.S.

822
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:00,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I get a fuck you to gas prices?

823
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:03,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, last I heard, they were working on DJ Hero, so...

824
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,816
[SPEAKER_08]: A Matter of Time, I guess.

825
00:58:08,037 --> 00:58:08,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Eventually.

826
00:58:09,998 --> 00:58:16,203
[SPEAKER_08]: You can always buy Beatmania 2DX, which did come out on PlayStation 2.

827
00:58:16,923 --> 00:58:19,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love a home version of Kraken DJ so bad.

828
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:22,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, didn't MTV try a game like that and fail horribly?

829
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Personally, I think that they're great because I have Radiohead.

830
00:58:30,813 --> 00:58:32,334
[SPEAKER_14]: I freaking love Radiohead.

831
00:58:32,354 --> 00:58:33,395
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing it needs is Blur.

832
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi!

833
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:36,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

834
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:38,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it for email?

835
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:43,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but speaking of blur, I was watching some band on the Graham Norton show yesterday.

836
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:46,227
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the first time I've ever actually watched any significant amount of this show.

837
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:52,391
[SPEAKER_14]: And I didn't know who they were, but some guy was playing the keyboard and I was like, this is a bad blur impersonation.

838
00:58:53,612 --> 00:59:02,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you want to send us emails and get Jamie all nostalgic for her favorite bands, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails to.

839
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:11,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, we're one story away from tonight's listless results and the revival of another favorite Orange Lounge radio segment.

840
00:59:11,932 --> 00:59:14,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Listless results on the way right after one more story.

841
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:14,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

842
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:24,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in case you're really, really, really lonely or just need something to hump, I guess, Sega has created a robotic girlfriend for you.

843
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:30,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Her name, I guess, is Emma, or Eternal Maiden Actualization.

844
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:36,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And she is... She looks like an Ivo.

845
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:38,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, she looks like an Ivo.

846
00:59:38,323 --> 00:59:39,984
[SPEAKER_15]: She looks like an Ivo.

847
00:59:40,964 --> 00:59:43,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And she stands, I guess...

848
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:46,552
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 inches tall.

849
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:49,473
[SPEAKER_08]: She can sing, dance, and totally make out with you.

850
00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:53,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there is a love mode where she'll hug you and kiss nearby humans.

851
00:59:55,514 --> 00:59:55,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

852
00:59:56,074 --> 00:59:57,554
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks like an eyeball.

853
00:59:58,434 --> 01:00:00,335
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

854
01:00:00,455 --> 01:00:04,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It's apparently 18,000 yen or $166 US if you're actually interested in this.

855
01:00:04,995 --> 01:00:08,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's coming out in September in Japan only.

856
01:00:09,476 --> 01:00:11,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So you gotta import them, girlfriends.

857
01:00:12,517 --> 01:00:14,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So what, do we call her EE for short?

858
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:16,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Emma.

859
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:17,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

860
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:17,908
[SPEAKER_07]: E-E.

861
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:18,088
[SPEAKER_07]: E-E.

862
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:18,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

863
01:00:19,948 --> 01:00:20,209
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

864
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:22,489
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks like a freaking AIBO, though.

865
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:22,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoosh.

866
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:26,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

867
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:27,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoosh.

868
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:27,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

869
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,032
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the name of the cooking game that was brought up earlier?

870
01:00:30,052 --> 01:00:31,073
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple people have been asking.

871
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:34,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have to pull the email back up.

872
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:35,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Cooking Guy.

873
01:00:35,254 --> 01:00:36,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't decide what to eat.

874
01:00:37,435 --> 01:00:37,695
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

875
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,536
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura will get on that later.

876
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:43,157
[SPEAKER_10]: But for now, we're going to reveal who won tonight's list list.

877
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:44,618
Hooray.

878
01:00:44,678 --> 01:00:45,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

879
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:51,860
[SPEAKER_10]: The top three songs, the definitive list of the best Bomani songs of all time.

880
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that there was any controversy in this process at all.

881
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:57,621
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it's time to reveal the list.

882
01:00:57,761 --> 01:01:02,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Your number three pick was Bitmania.

883
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Was your number three pick.

884
01:01:10,824 --> 01:01:17,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Your number two pick, and this kind of surprised me, was Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.

885
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:42,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And the number one best Bomani song of all freaking time as voted by you, our chatroom based on our list here in studio was Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove Up

886
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:54,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Which kind of fits that a Naoki song should take the title.

887
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:55,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there you have it.

888
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

889
01:01:57,399 --> 01:01:59,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Our not controversial at all list.

890
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:01,221
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

891
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:04,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Skulk, one point away from being on that list.

892
01:02:04,122 --> 01:02:06,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And lots of them tied there in the back, too.

893
01:02:06,763 --> 01:02:08,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have a bone to pick with Skulk.

894
01:02:09,144 --> 01:02:09,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh, what's that?

895
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:11,525
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes me drive too fast.

896
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:13,566
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing wrong with that.

897
01:02:15,876 --> 01:02:16,196
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

898
01:02:16,997 --> 01:02:24,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's time for the Skype line where you can give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

899
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:28,805
[SPEAKER_10]: But tonight we have a little twist on the Skype line.

900
01:02:29,185 --> 01:02:30,706
[SPEAKER_10]: We know it's an anniversary show.

901
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:33,488
[SPEAKER_10]: We know there's a lot of people that want to call in tonight probably.

902
01:02:34,048 --> 01:02:36,390
[SPEAKER_10]: At least there's been quite a few people in chat telling me they want to call.

903
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,151
[SPEAKER_10]: We encourage everybody to call in tonight.

904
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,772
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give a little extra time for that to happen.

905
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:43,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But tonight we're doing something special for the phone calls,

906
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:48,017
[SPEAKER_10]: favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

907
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:51,158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something we like to call Ask Orange Lounge.

908
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:18,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

909
01:03:18,782 --> 01:03:22,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, quien es?

910
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Echo 123 Play Old Bumpers

911
01:03:59,016 --> 01:03:59,916
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you go.

912
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,797
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your question for Drunami tonight?

913
01:04:01,817 --> 01:04:01,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

914
01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:31,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you continued playing La Milana or did you give up on it?

915
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:35,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had much time to play La Milana, but I will get into it.

916
01:04:35,992 --> 01:04:43,455
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Nintendo hard, it's Battletoads hard, so I may get into it once I'm finished playing Hellgate for a while.

917
01:04:44,356 --> 01:04:45,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets easier later on.

918
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:51,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as far as my Battletoads hard games go, I may start with I Want to Be the Guy.

919
01:04:52,419 --> 01:04:54,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I Want to Be the Guy, that's just retarded.

920
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Apples don't fall up.

921
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,723
[SPEAKER_06]: They're more like giant cherries.

922
01:05:28,432 --> 01:05:29,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I don't know.

923
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:30,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I will think about that during this call.

924
01:05:30,653 --> 01:05:31,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

925
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:32,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

926
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:32,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

927
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:34,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

928
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:36,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator, what's on your mind?

929
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:38,658
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your question tonight for us?

930
01:05:38,698 --> 01:05:39,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, first.

931
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:40,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, hold on.

932
01:05:40,779 --> 01:05:41,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, Spazinator.

933
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to enjoy the cake.

934
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:43,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom.

935
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, nom, nom, nom.

936
01:05:45,302 --> 01:05:46,162
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you go.

937
01:05:46,182 --> 01:05:47,543
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your question for us tonight?

938
01:05:47,963 --> 01:05:54,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, uh, yeah, I was wondering, uh, just off the top of your head, do you know if there's any chance in hell that, uh,

939
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow will be coming to either the PS3 or to the Xbox 360?

940
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:20,149
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Blizzard realizes that most people that own consoles also own PCs somewhere in their home, so there really wouldn't be a lot of crossover potential.

941
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:34,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, I think they probably look at games that came out like Final Fantasy XI, which is a really weird analogy to use because Final Fantasy XI was originally developed for the PlayStation 2, and that's how a lot of people in Japan play it, but damn, I cannot play that game unless it's on a PC.

942
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:35,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

943
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,867
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to keep it simple to the console basics.

944
01:06:53,327 --> 01:06:54,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, here's the other thing, though.

945
01:06:55,068 --> 01:07:02,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Would a WoW spin-off game, like an arcade game or something else in the Warcraft universe, be counted out for console?

946
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:02,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily.

947
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:04,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at StarCraft Ghost, even though that was cancelled.

948
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:10,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Something along those lines, I would say, is a much bigger possibility than actually seeing WoW itself on consoles.

949
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:13,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Champions of Norrath.

950
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an EverQuiz spin-off.

951
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,017
[SPEAKER_10]: That worked fairly well.

952
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:16,977
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

953
01:07:36,405 --> 01:07:38,226
[SPEAKER_07]: MMOs don't really work for consoles.

954
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:47,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with the exception of Phantasy Star Online and its sequels and Final Fantasy XI, name a successful console MMO in the States.

955
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:50,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't think of any.

956
01:07:50,551 --> 01:08:03,097
[SPEAKER_01]: The only two I ever played was Final Fantasy XI and the console version of EverQuest which came out for the PS2 but I thought the PS2 version of EverQuest was kind of crappy though.

957
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:10,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know a lot of people that play Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360, but Final Fantasy XI in Japan is huge on consoles.

958
01:08:10,464 --> 01:08:11,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of people here that play it.

959
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,687
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably the most successful console MMO.

960
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, Spazinator, we gotta go so we can get some more questions.

961
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:18,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your question.

962
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:19,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy your cake.

963
01:08:19,651 --> 01:08:20,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, thanks.

964
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:24,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

965
01:08:24,675 --> 01:08:27,577
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Wii and Vibrator thing?

966
01:08:27,857 --> 01:08:28,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Wii Brator.

967
01:08:29,098 --> 01:08:30,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like it sounds.

968
01:08:31,099 --> 01:08:31,600
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a...

969
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:36,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace of software to turn your Wii remote into a vibrator.

970
01:08:36,804 --> 01:08:37,964
[SPEAKER_12]: They have one of this for iPods.

971
01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:46,527
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says it's some sort of thing that it says event vibrator simulation.

972
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

973
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:50,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go back to the phones.

974
01:08:50,428 --> 01:08:51,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

975
01:08:51,408 --> 01:08:51,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

976
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead Pixels on Raven's Dolphin.

977
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:58,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven's Dolphin, the one and only, the man, the legend.

978
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven's Dolphin, please enjoy some cake.

979
01:09:01,598 --> 01:09:03,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enjoying some pie, but that's okay.

980
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:04,580
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

981
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie is your preference.

982
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:08,843
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Ravis Dolphin, what is your question for us here on OLR tonight?

983
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:18,109
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you is, over the years, you're all gamers, how much do you think you spent over the years of gaming and money?

984
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:25,973
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually added up just my Bimani collection one time and exceeded a few thousand dollars on just that.

985
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:35,139
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I would have to say that I would value my video game collection right now at maybe about $15,000?

986
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:36,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe more?

987
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:37,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't you say?

988
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:44,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly don't know Raven's Dolphin, and if I were to think about it, I would probably want to go, like, hang myself.

989
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:45,702
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really, not really.

990
01:09:45,742 --> 01:09:46,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't be ashamed of it.

991
01:09:46,722 --> 01:09:49,304
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, think about the MMOs I've played over the years.

992
01:09:49,344 --> 01:09:52,106
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, $15 a month here, $12 a month there.

993
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:59,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that alone has been, I spend easily $100 a month, and then during the holidays, new consoles come out even more on games.

994
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:01,492
[SPEAKER_10]: God, it's a lot, Raven's Dolphin.

995
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:07,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Easily, probably in the time that we've been doing OLR alone, I would say, what, six years?

996
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:07,256
[SPEAKER_10]: $10,000, easily.

997
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:11,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Do consoles and PC hardware count?

998
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:14,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that is gaming.

999
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:33,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to say, aside from games that were lost, I'd say hardware and software, easily $3,000, $4,000 worth of games, includes the computers I've built and the consoles that I've bought, and monthly fees.

1000
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a lot.

1001
01:10:36,454 --> 01:10:38,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you do even dare to answer this question?

1002
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:39,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know.

1003
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:41,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even going to try to guess.

1004
01:10:42,698 --> 01:10:43,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It will make me want to cry.

1005
01:10:44,499 --> 01:10:47,981
[SPEAKER_10]: So Raven's Dolphin, thank you very much for your call and making us all want to slash our wrists.

1006
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:49,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, bye.

1007
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:50,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy your cake.

1008
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:50,903
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1009
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:56,626
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1010
01:10:56,646 --> 01:10:57,727
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another call coming in.

1011
01:10:58,227 --> 01:10:59,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1012
01:10:59,348 --> 01:10:59,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1013
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:02,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello there, Orange Downs.

1014
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,302
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the, uh, well, what?

1015
01:11:04,702 --> 01:11:06,243
[SPEAKER_18]: The other one from Sweden.

1016
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:08,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Our Swedish listener.

1017
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:09,366
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you.

1018
01:11:09,406 --> 01:11:09,946
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

1019
01:11:10,787 --> 01:11:11,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha ha.

1020
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:12,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

1021
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:15,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for you, some, an extra big piece of cake.

1022
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

1023
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:16,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom nom nom.

1024
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:18,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, duh.

1025
01:11:19,093 --> 01:11:19,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn.

1026
01:11:20,394 --> 01:11:21,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, just, ah, damn.

1027
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:23,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a minute.

1028
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:23,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there.

1029
01:11:24,497 --> 01:11:25,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, what was my question?

1030
01:11:25,558 --> 01:11:25,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

1031
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:32,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was a weird intergalactical transmission while he was trying to eat cake there.

1032
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:37,124
[SPEAKER_18]: I was getting flashbacks from Max Headroom.

1033
01:11:37,164 --> 01:11:38,264
[SPEAKER_18]: Dream cakes in my case.

1034
01:11:39,965 --> 01:11:40,605
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your question?

1035
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:41,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1036
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:48,329
[SPEAKER_18]: My question was, Rob, how do you enjoy end gaming in World of Warcraft?

1037
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:51,877
[SPEAKER_10]: How am I enjoying endgaming in World of Warcraft?

1038
01:11:51,897 --> 01:12:05,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Great question, because I've been recently going into raids, 25-man raids now, like Serpent Shrine Cavern, and it's amazing how well-organized a lot of groups are and almost treat it like it's a job.

1039
01:12:05,824 --> 01:12:06,485
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

1040
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:12,748
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to show up on time, and you've got to be there, and if you don't perform well, then you may not come back the next week.

1041
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:15,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fascinating, the kind of culture around it.

1042
01:12:15,309 --> 01:12:15,810
[SPEAKER_10]: But as far as...

1043
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:17,170
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

1044
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Blizzard is actively pushing Blizzard is actively pushing Blizzard is actively pushing

1045
01:13:11,485 --> 01:13:15,779
[SPEAKER_18]: People getting towards the end since

1046
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:20,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Square Enix didn't do that exactly?

1047
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:30,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, because Blizzard has kind of reduced the experience caps to make it quicker to get to the Burning Crusade content, and kind of speculation is there's going to be kind of an easier way to get to 80, too.

1048
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:37,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, heck, you're going to be able to make characters that start at level 55 in the new expansion, but you have to already have a level 55.

1049
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:39,711
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still kind of interesting that they're doing that.

1050
01:13:39,731 --> 01:13:40,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1051
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:45,115
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I love how Blizzard patches their game all the time with new stuff.

1052
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:56,065
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be fair, other MMOs I've played, and I keep going back to Final Fantasy XI, but only because I've played it for so long, they do that too, but Blizzard just, when they have a whole freaking new zone to it with new quests, it's great.

1053
01:13:56,365 --> 01:14:01,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the reason behind all that motivation, I mean, Rob, you're into endgame now, you're raiding.

1054
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:04,772
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how certain encounters are gear checks and some are skill checks?

1055
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:08,516
[SPEAKER_07]: You go to Karazhan nowadays, which is your starting raid,

1056
01:14:09,676 --> 01:14:10,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Nightbane?

1057
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That is your motivation check.

1058
01:14:12,738 --> 01:14:16,340
[SPEAKER_07]: If you keep wiping to Nightbane and you give up, you're not cut out for raiding.

1059
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:16,900
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny?

1060
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't fought Nightbane.

1061
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:19,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time my guild beat it, I wasn't there.

1062
01:14:19,742 --> 01:14:21,443
[SPEAKER_10]: But we pretty much have Kara on farm status now.

1063
01:14:21,463 --> 01:14:22,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got to Kara.

1064
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:24,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I stopped raiding at Molten Core.

1065
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:27,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well that's also... I see I missed all that stuff.

1066
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,448
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, thanks for the thing on Nightbane.

1067
01:14:31,928 --> 01:14:34,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever your name was, since I don't remember.

1068
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:34,770
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Drew.

1069
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:35,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Drew.

1070
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:36,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1071
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:37,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Since...

1072
01:14:38,222 --> 01:14:48,486
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason I'm asking is that a few, like last week or so, I myself actually dinged 70 on a shaman, a troll shaman.

1073
01:14:48,646 --> 01:14:52,028
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's my reason for asking, by the way.

1074
01:14:53,588 --> 01:14:58,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Gratz, just take it nice and easy, work on getting your gear up, and you'll be ready for Kara in no time.

1075
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:00,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Prepare for a lifetime of healing.

1076
01:15:01,311 --> 01:15:02,072
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

1077
01:15:02,092 --> 01:15:03,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it depends what type he is.

1078
01:15:03,053 --> 01:15:03,253
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1079
01:15:03,473 --> 01:15:04,454
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to let you go, though, buddy.

1080
01:15:04,614 --> 01:15:05,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We're running over.

1081
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:06,196
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to take more calls.

1082
01:15:06,316 --> 01:15:06,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

1083
01:15:07,297 --> 01:15:07,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the question.

1084
01:15:07,857 --> 01:15:08,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy your cake.

1085
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:10,339
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1086
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:13,983
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1087
01:15:14,163 --> 01:15:15,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think you'd know that by now.

1088
01:15:16,024 --> 01:15:17,326
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't, there you have it again.

1089
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:21,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other last-minute stories for us, Loki, while we wait for a few more calls?

1090
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:22,290
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one.

1091
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:23,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we got another call.

1092
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:23,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1093
01:15:24,092 --> 01:15:24,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1094
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:25,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1095
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:28,199
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1096
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:59,937
[SPEAKER_14]: It was for the longest time carrot cake, but I have found something that I think I like just a little bit more.

1097
01:16:00,537 --> 01:16:04,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's carrot cake cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.

1098
01:16:04,938 --> 01:16:06,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff is fucking awesome.

1099
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:07,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Amen.

1100
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,480
[SPEAKER_19]: I love carrot cake.

1101
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:10,961
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds good.

1102
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:12,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1103
01:16:13,312 --> 01:16:18,919
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite dessert had to have been from my old boss that I worked under at Roundtable.

1104
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:21,201
[SPEAKER_08]: He opened his own restaurant called BJ's.

1105
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:29,731
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a 50-50, basically orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and stuff like that.

1106
01:16:30,612 --> 01:16:31,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Pazooki

1107
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,570
[SPEAKER_10]: The peanut butter pizookie is so frickin' good.

1108
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:51,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

1109
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I have sadness about the pizookie.

1110
01:16:54,132 --> 01:16:54,392
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1111
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:59,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually, they, I can't, I've had one twice now and both times I've gotten violently ill.

1112
01:17:00,576 --> 01:17:03,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's a crime because those things are so frickin' good.

1113
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:04,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I won't say it.

1114
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:06,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel your pain.

1115
01:17:06,219 --> 01:17:07,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't have them anymore because of the low fat thing.

1116
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there you have it.

1117
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew, quickly.

1118
01:17:10,561 --> 01:17:20,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, cake pie jokes aside, I'd have to say mine's a toss-up between classic root beer float and chocolate soup.

1119
01:17:21,287 --> 01:17:22,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew, that sounds gross.

1120
01:17:22,428 --> 01:17:33,995
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, chocolate soup, here we are, chocolate soup is warm chocolate brownie, fudge brownie, topped with chocolate pudding and chocolate whipped cream.

1121
01:17:35,802 --> 01:17:40,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you bastard, thanks for making us all hungry, but no, I'm just kidding.

1122
01:17:40,386 --> 01:17:42,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Really quickly, do you have a favorite dessert, Gold Banjo?

1123
01:17:43,509 --> 01:17:49,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, ah, jeez, I should have probably thought of that before I even came on.

1124
01:17:50,882 --> 01:17:51,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1125
01:17:51,483 --> 01:17:52,443
[SPEAKER_19]: I just like ice cream.

1126
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:28,899
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skyporn's launch radio Jamie, you had a last minute story I did, and this was one sent to us by Rob with two B's You know, I love Disneyland Me too I want to go back to Disneyland But you know, California Adventure is being given this massive facelift, right?

1127
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Makeover!

1128
01:18:31,141 --> 01:18:31,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah.

1129
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:35,685
[SPEAKER_14]: At any rate, because, well, they've lost a lot of money.

1130
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:50,757
[SPEAKER_14]: So what they've done at Paradise Pier is they've taken out a lot of the Midway stuff and underneath California Screamin', which is the big roller coaster there, they put something called Midway Mania, which is...

1131
01:18:53,147 --> 01:18:56,649
[SPEAKER_14]: It's... I'm trying to find exactly... That's not the new Toy Story ride?

1132
01:18:56,989 --> 01:18:57,169
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1133
01:18:57,569 --> 01:18:58,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought it was.

1134
01:18:58,509 --> 01:18:58,989
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, it is.

1135
01:18:59,009 --> 01:19:00,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, it is the new Toy Story ride.

1136
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:00,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1137
01:19:01,511 --> 01:19:02,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Which looks cool.

1138
01:19:02,391 --> 01:19:08,093
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's basically different 3D challenges and mini games and stuff that goes through it.

1139
01:19:08,133 --> 01:19:09,134
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's pretty cool.

1140
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:10,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1141
01:19:28,288 --> 01:19:28,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Kitsune!

1142
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:29,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom nom nom!

1143
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:55,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I was walking through Ikea Bar the other day, and I've been really late on my gaming news.

1144
01:19:55,109 --> 01:19:56,270
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really kept up with it.

1145
01:19:56,310 --> 01:20:00,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw the new Soul Calibur 4 ad that's coming out July 31st.

1146
01:20:00,992 --> 01:20:05,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was kind of surprised to see Yoda on there, because I hadn't really heard anything about it.

1147
01:20:05,855 --> 01:20:09,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was wondering if you guys had heard anything about that.

1148
01:20:10,117 --> 01:20:14,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there has been quite a bit of news in the States here about what's going on with Soul Calibur 4.

1149
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:20,010
[SPEAKER_14]: and we also had Darth Vader in the PS3 version too.

1150
01:20:20,669 --> 01:20:24,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, somehow Star Wars is suddenly colliding with Soul Calibur World.

1151
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what kind of weird licensing is going on there, but yes, Yoda will be in the Xbox 360 version and Darth Vader will be in the PlayStation 3 version of Soul Calibur 4.

1152
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:35,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Both versions will have the Apprentice guy.

1153
01:20:36,594 --> 01:20:37,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what his name was.

1154
01:20:37,654 --> 01:20:45,277
[SPEAKER_10]: The Secret Apprentice from... Not Donald Trump's Apprentice, but Darth Vader's Apprentice from the Force Unleashed games, which are coming out very soon.

1155
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:48,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, so it's only one character per...

1156
01:20:48,738 --> 01:20:49,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Wars Masters of Terakasi

1157
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:18,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm sure the Japanese are going to eat that game up because they love Star Wars.

1158
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,830
[SPEAKER_11]: You see it everywhere here.

1159
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,250
[SPEAKER_11]: You even see it in porn stores.

1160
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:22,351
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1161
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:23,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe that would explain why.

1162
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:29,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when we saw it announced here, the reaction was kind of like, what the hell kind of random pairing is that?

1163
01:21:30,272 --> 01:21:32,613
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you kind of go, well, I guess it'll work.

1164
01:21:32,873 --> 01:21:34,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess if Spawn can be in it, why not?

1165
01:21:35,213 --> 01:21:36,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But that makes a lot of sense.

1166
01:21:36,294 --> 01:21:41,055
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's more of a cultural thing in Japan, they're probably blah, blah, blah, goo, goo, goo, gaga over it.

1167
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:41,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

1168
01:21:41,955 --> 01:21:42,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping to make up something.

1169
01:21:43,676 --> 01:21:46,077
[SPEAKER_11]: and Toys R Us dedicated to it.

1170
01:21:46,097 --> 01:21:52,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping to make up some of the ground that maybe Soul Calibur 3 lost because it wasn't quite as well received, at least over here, although I thought it was still great.

1171
01:21:52,181 --> 01:21:53,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Mostly because it corrupted memory cards.

1172
01:21:55,203 --> 01:21:55,783
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another story.

1173
01:21:56,023 --> 01:21:58,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Kitsune, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

1174
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:00,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1175
01:22:00,747 --> 01:22:03,548
[SPEAKER_10]: We always enjoy hearing what's going on across the ocean.

1176
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:08,552
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting more and more Japanese listeners lately, which is kind of neat.

1177
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:11,912
[SPEAKER_10]: We have AkumaJP in the JustinTV chat.

1178
01:22:11,952 --> 01:22:13,593
[SPEAKER_10]: We get a few on email once in a while.

1179
01:22:14,493 --> 01:22:14,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

1180
01:22:15,053 --> 01:22:17,094
[SPEAKER_10]: We love hearing from other people in different parts of the country.

1181
01:22:17,414 --> 01:22:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I was just thinking of one of our listeners.

1182
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:20,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if he's listening tonight.

1183
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:23,136
[SPEAKER_10]: FootyMonster the other day, because he's in Argentina.

1184
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:24,597
[SPEAKER_09]: FootyMonster was in the chat room today.

1185
01:22:25,237 --> 01:22:26,858
[SPEAKER_10]: My roommate is in Argentina right now.

1186
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:30,799
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in Buenos Aires with his sister, and he's been posting updates to LiveJournal.

1187
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:32,040
[SPEAKER_14]: FootyMonster's in there right now?

1188
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:32,880
[SPEAKER_10]: is he?

1189
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:41,268
[SPEAKER_10]: in chat, yeah oh, cool you should tell me some fun things to do in Buenos Aires I can pass along to my roommate you know who else is in chat who's not reading his PMs?

1190
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:45,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf is that your not-so-private message?

[SPEAKER_10]: alright hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

1212
01:23:35,173 --> 01:23:37,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, oh, Footy Monster.

1213
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:41,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I don't want to pick up the phone and hear myself.

1214
01:23:41,379 --> 01:23:42,700
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to definitely turn it down.

1215
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:44,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1216
01:23:44,562 --> 01:23:44,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1217
01:23:51,221 --> 01:24:01,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Zaku, I baked a special cake for you, here you go Can you taste the deadly neurotoxin?

1218
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:04,874
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special brownie Zaku, what is your question for you?

1219
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:15,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, Adam put me up to calling you because of the, you know, Anime Next and everything Oh, I promised you guys could talk about Anime Next Alright, I will make a special exception for you How was Anime Next?

1220
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:25,103
[SPEAKER_00]: It was alright, I mean, mostly liquor and just getting our group party shut down I think Adam remembers Oh, you know it's a good party if they have to shut it down

1221
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:30,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's more like the guy across the hall that snitched on us.

1222
01:24:31,435 --> 01:24:35,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty loud, so we pretty much gave ourselves up.

1223
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,461
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave ourselves up to those guys.

1224
01:24:39,262 --> 01:24:42,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in terms of the game room, it was...

1225
01:24:43,593 --> 01:24:47,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I mean, it was a pretty, it was a mix of everything.

1226
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:50,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly bigger than the one last year.

1227
01:24:51,356 --> 01:24:56,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I mean, the centerpiece was pretty much Brawl, for that matter.

1228
01:24:56,898 --> 01:25:00,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Smash Brothers Brawl, so it was like people feeding on that game.

1229
01:25:01,967 --> 01:25:21,001
[SPEAKER_00]: but they had every other anime convention game staple like Third Strike, 2DX, other anime based games and that was about it I don't think I have my cameras right there Were there topless girls there?

1230
01:25:21,061 --> 01:25:21,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

1231
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there topless girls there?

1232
01:25:31,068 --> 01:25:32,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not really, unfortunately.

1233
01:25:32,889 --> 01:25:35,390
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a lot of noise.

1234
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:38,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there were boobs, or no, there were no boobs.

1235
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:40,371
[SPEAKER_10]: There were no boobs.

1236
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:43,512
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the party shut down?

1237
01:25:43,712 --> 01:25:44,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Tits, or get the fuck out.

1238
01:25:45,713 --> 01:25:46,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

1239
01:25:46,353 --> 01:25:47,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1240
01:25:48,354 --> 01:25:48,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1241
01:25:49,714 --> 01:25:50,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Zaku, have a good one.

1242
01:25:50,815 --> 01:25:52,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the con.

1243
01:25:54,376 --> 01:25:54,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1244
01:25:55,376 --> 01:25:57,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1245
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is the gay guy the one clamoring to see tits?

1246
01:26:03,971 --> 01:26:04,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is.

1247
01:26:05,532 --> 01:26:08,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Something about, it's that special party atmosphere.

1248
01:26:09,254 --> 01:26:10,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Jamie likes tits too.

1249
01:26:11,215 --> 01:26:11,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1250
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:13,476
[SPEAKER_10]: We're slowly turning you straight, Rob.

1251
01:26:13,596 --> 01:26:14,636
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a conspiracy.

1252
01:26:14,696 --> 01:26:16,557
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a vast fucking conspiracy.

1253
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:19,019
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1254
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:20,019
[SPEAKER_10]: On Skype or 1-8.

1255
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:22,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still hearing myself, my friend.

1256
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,301
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta figure out how to make your sound card.

1257
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:24,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Echo 1-2-3, sir.

1258
01:26:26,701 --> 01:26:34,688
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually studies out there that say it's actually pretty much across the board for guys to have an obsession with boobs no matter if they're gay or straight.

1259
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:38,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for making me doubt, Jamie.

1260
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:39,612
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to another phone.

1261
01:26:39,912 --> 01:26:40,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1262
01:26:40,312 --> 01:26:42,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe boobs will get brought up in this conversation.

1263
01:26:42,194 --> 01:26:42,674
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1264
01:26:42,774 --> 01:26:44,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1265
01:26:44,075 --> 01:26:44,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1266
01:26:45,316 --> 01:26:46,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is Bobby.

1267
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:47,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1268
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:48,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say boobie?

1269
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:49,980
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I said Bobby.

1270
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Bobby.

1271
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:53,203
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, my friend?

1272
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:53,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1273
01:26:54,065 --> 01:26:54,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good.

1274
01:26:54,845 --> 01:27:06,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you, being our neighbor on AllGames.com and definitely helping save our show when the evil Live365 almost shut us down, you, my friend, get an extra large piece of cake.

1275
01:27:06,108 --> 01:27:07,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So here, enjoy some cake.

1276
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:09,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom!

1277
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:12,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that was awesome.

1278
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the cops are going to go shut down the party at Bobby's house.

1279
01:27:15,771 --> 01:27:16,431
[SPEAKER_10]: He's having too much fun.

1280
01:27:16,451 --> 01:27:18,472
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what is your question for us, my friend?

1281
01:27:20,059 --> 01:27:21,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we have listened to it.

1282
01:27:42,728 --> 01:27:49,291
[SPEAKER_17]: But I hear you guys kind of complaining about the state of music games sometimes today, and complaining about certain aspects of music games.

1283
01:27:49,331 --> 01:27:57,294
[SPEAKER_17]: So what would a music game have to be, and what would it need to have for you to not complain about it if it was made today?

1284
01:27:57,967 --> 01:28:04,029
[SPEAKER_10]: What would a music game have to have or be for us to not bitch about them anymore?

1285
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:05,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

1286
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:10,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if I was gonna go... You're not even necessarily shouting original from the kitchen.

1287
01:28:10,772 --> 01:28:18,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think original even has to be the case, because if you look at, like, DDR and stuff, it's been almost the same throughout every release.

1288
01:28:18,675 --> 01:28:22,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the thing that's kind of been lost, especially with, like, DDR recently, is...

1289
01:28:23,457 --> 01:28:27,240
[SPEAKER_08]: With DDR, when you look at the track list and stuff, there's songs in there.

1290
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,121
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, wow, that's really cool.

1291
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:31,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to find out more about this artist or something like that.

1292
01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:32,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, oh, that's really cool.

1293
01:28:33,283 --> 01:28:36,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to check out some more music of that genre or something like that.

1294
01:28:37,106 --> 01:28:42,469
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, the new releases that come out, it's just like, oh, look, this was on Beatmania.

1295
01:28:42,509 --> 01:28:43,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it in DDR.

1296
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:45,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, look, there's another game from Guitar Freaks.

1297
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:47,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's throw it in DDR.

1298
01:28:47,592 --> 01:28:48,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, look, this is a...

1299
01:28:49,314 --> 01:29:02,974
[SPEAKER_08]: A top 10 song right now on the pop charts Hey, let's put it in DDR There's no real exploration with the music there They're worried about appealing to the masses Instead of just, let's put some good stuff in there and that's it

1300
01:29:03,513 --> 01:29:04,474
[SPEAKER_12]: They should let us make one.

1301
01:29:06,837 --> 01:29:09,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I've kind of said this before on the show and I still stand by this.

1302
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:15,546
[SPEAKER_10]: My problem with DDR is that it kind of has slipped into this whole... It's just song list update of the year.

1303
01:29:16,026 --> 01:29:20,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's not a whole lot... I mean, they try to do some new things with every game, but I don't know.

1304
01:29:20,511 --> 01:29:22,433
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR is starting to feel a little bit stale to me.

1305
01:29:22,553 --> 01:29:22,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think...

1306
01:29:23,894 --> 01:29:30,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said this before, and I still believe that DDR needs to be rebuilt from the ground up completely, and maybe throw a competitive twist in it.

1307
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:42,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I even see the last great mix that I thought there was was Max 2, because you would have to play the songs, and then you would earn points or whatever to unlock the next song.

1308
01:29:42,258 --> 01:29:44,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was at random of what song would be unlocked next.

1309
01:29:45,559 --> 01:29:49,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Konami, for every single fucking home release that you spoiled the entire song list for.

1310
01:29:49,282 --> 01:29:51,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's no surprises whatsoever.

1311
01:30:03,971 --> 01:30:08,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And for God's sake, I do not want to play through another fucking quest mode to unlock shit.

1312
01:30:09,252 --> 01:30:09,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

1313
01:30:09,732 --> 01:30:10,853
[SPEAKER_08]: That was never fun.

1314
01:30:11,293 --> 01:30:11,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever.

1315
01:30:13,353 --> 01:30:14,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you did hit the nail on the head with something.

1316
01:30:15,393 --> 01:30:17,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Jamie wants to talk too.

1317
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:18,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcades.

1318
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:23,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the fact that arcades have gone downhill have sadly made the whole music game scene kind of follow.

1319
01:30:23,955 --> 01:30:25,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just tragic.

1320
01:30:25,756 --> 01:30:27,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's not a lot that can be helped with that, DarkSakura.

1321
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:30,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say the versus mode in Disney's Rave.

1322
01:30:31,937 --> 01:30:33,118
[SPEAKER_13]: That was freaking epic.

1323
01:30:33,638 --> 01:30:38,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the way to properly do versus battle in a DDR game.

1324
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,940
[SPEAKER_13]: And bring back Keyboard Mania.

1325
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:43,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the problem, and I'm going to catch some flack for this.

1326
01:30:43,702 --> 01:30:54,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Konami to death, but still, every time a competing company comes up with something to enhance the DDR formula, what does Konami do?

1327
01:30:55,427 --> 01:30:57,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami sues the pants off of them.

1328
01:30:58,502 --> 01:31:00,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened with Andamiro with Pump It Up.

1329
01:31:00,483 --> 01:31:02,504
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened with Roxor and In The Groove.

1330
01:31:02,844 --> 01:31:06,545
[SPEAKER_07]: They both added shit to the DDR formula, and they are both rejected.

1331
01:31:07,686 --> 01:31:09,567
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they did not add anything to the formula.

1332
01:31:09,667 --> 01:31:12,108
[SPEAKER_08]: All they did was rip it off and try to call it their own.

1333
01:31:12,488 --> 01:31:13,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, that's all they did.

1334
01:31:14,089 --> 01:31:16,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they made arrows that you have to stomp on a lot.

1335
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, original.

1336
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:20,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, hold... Oh, Mines.

1337
01:31:20,992 --> 01:31:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame.

1338
01:31:22,632 --> 01:31:24,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Mines was retarded, okay?

1339
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:26,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's retarded.

1340
01:31:27,304 --> 01:31:28,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did you have to turn it back on me?

1341
01:31:28,965 --> 01:31:30,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have an answer.

1342
01:31:30,326 --> 01:31:31,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's what I do.

1343
01:31:57,537 --> 01:31:58,698
[SPEAKER_17]: BIMANI Games

1344
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:20,181
[SPEAKER_17]: On the PS1, I had an import console and I imported the games and stuff.

1345
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:25,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Back in the 90s, I was like, man, I wish this genre would come out in the States.

1346
01:32:25,544 --> 01:32:26,904
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish it would get big in the States.

1347
01:32:26,964 --> 01:32:31,666
[SPEAKER_17]: And I kept waiting for something other than DDR because I don't want to move my legs.

1348
01:32:32,667 --> 01:32:40,611
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I was really happy to see Guitar Hero finally figure it out that, hey, you've got to put in songs people recognize.

1349
01:32:41,548 --> 01:32:45,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I thought that was a really great way to do it.

1350
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:54,174
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I can see Guitar Hero and Rock Band possibly becoming the new Madden, where it's roster update 2008 here, buy another set of songs for $60.

1351
01:32:55,595 --> 01:33:03,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And now what's different between this and Madden is that now you're going to have to buy new guitars each time, or new controllers, because they...

1352
01:33:04,099 --> 01:33:06,000
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just going to say we need a US pop and music.

1353
01:33:30,603 --> 01:33:30,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1354
01:33:31,203 --> 01:33:35,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you hit the nail on the head with something kind of in there, at least something I drew from it.

1355
01:33:35,626 --> 01:33:41,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the reason why Bomani didn't succeed as well outside of DDR in the States is that Konami didn't believe in it.

1356
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have no one but themselves to blame.

1357
01:33:44,072 --> 01:33:48,895
[SPEAKER_10]: They should have tried it a lot sooner and they could have gotten a piece of this Guitar Hero drum mania craze.

1358
01:33:48,955 --> 01:33:52,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they just look like they're third place with this whole rock revolution thing.

1359
01:33:52,677 --> 01:33:55,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And shame on them for not realizing what they had before.

1360
01:33:57,011 --> 01:33:57,591
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1361
01:34:20,558 --> 01:34:23,341
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 new songs we got in that game.

1362
01:34:23,361 --> 01:34:27,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And the least thing to do was make harder note files for Virtual Insanity.

1363
01:34:29,348 --> 01:34:34,213
[SPEAKER_10]: If they had a little more faith in it, I think we would have seen something a little more involved.

1364
01:34:36,703 --> 01:34:46,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they tried, because I remember, actually my first ever experience with Beatmania was actually at one of the very old E3s, I think maybe 98.

1365
01:34:47,311 --> 01:34:54,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Konami actually had their Hip Hop Mania arcade machine in the booth, because they were testing it in certain arcades in Chicago.

1366
01:34:55,016 --> 01:34:59,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And I fell in love with it then, and that's when I went out to go find the PS1 versions.

1367
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:02,132
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what started me off with it?

1368
01:35:02,152 --> 01:35:06,056
[SPEAKER_14]: People complaining about the whole emulator and sim file market.

1369
01:35:06,096 --> 01:35:09,179
[SPEAKER_14]: My first Beatmania experience was BM98.

1370
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the day.

1371
01:35:12,061 --> 01:35:21,551
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when I went out hunting for my 5-key controller and getting a stack of games at Network Video when they still sold games and weren't closed.

1372
01:35:22,271 --> 01:35:22,692
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean...

1373
01:35:24,421 --> 01:35:35,899
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it also is to say that the companies I think should be looking towards the people that are making the emulators and sim files because that right there I think is going to be your key indicator of what the community wants.

1374
01:35:37,381 --> 01:35:38,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Look to that for inspiration.

1375
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:42,939
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1376
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:49,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Bobby, this has been a pretty epic phone call, but it's definitely something that's a part of our history we like to look back on.

1377
01:35:50,021 --> 01:35:50,781
[SPEAKER_10]: And you never know.

1378
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:53,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I always kind of hope there'll be another Beatmania in the U.S.

1379
01:35:53,282 --> 01:35:53,622
[SPEAKER_10]: someday.

1380
01:35:53,682 --> 01:35:54,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't hold my breath over it.

1381
01:35:55,222 --> 01:36:04,284
[SPEAKER_10]: But now it's kind of gotten to the point where it's like, well, if Konami's not going to do it, maybe someone else will because music games have shown they can be successful here in the States.

1382
01:36:04,764 --> 01:36:05,525
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do agree.

1383
01:36:05,585 --> 01:36:06,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope they get standardized.

1384
01:36:07,225 --> 01:36:11,739
[SPEAKER_10]: because I think that's where it's all going to fall apart is when you have to get one controller for this game, one controller for this game.

1385
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,384
[SPEAKER_10]: The mainstream is just not going to buy it.

1386
01:36:14,554 --> 01:36:17,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the next sequel, you're going to have to get a new controller to work.

1387
01:36:17,455 --> 01:36:19,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Do all the stuff that's in the new sequel and stuff.

1388
01:36:19,596 --> 01:36:21,977
[SPEAKER_17]: But one last thing about the poppin'.

1389
01:36:22,457 --> 01:36:32,340
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think that Konami really should try bringing that poppin' over here because some people, when they come to my apartment, I've got my desktop arcade ASC for poppin' music.

1390
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,741
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody looks at that and they're like, what's that?

1391
01:36:33,781 --> 01:36:34,941
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, yeah, that's for another music game.

1392
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:36,682
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like, oh, you mean like Guitar Hero?

1393
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:38,743
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, yeah, but you slap the balloons.

1394
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:39,583
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're like...

1395
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:41,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, that sounds cool.

1396
01:36:41,704 --> 01:36:42,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Papa Music is great.

1397
01:36:43,305 --> 01:36:45,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Papa Music might have a problem coming to the States.

1398
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:46,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a bit of an image problem.

1399
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:49,429
[SPEAKER_07]: People will see it and think it's a kids game.

1400
01:36:49,629 --> 01:36:54,992
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as I know, I think that Papa Music actually has the biggest following in Japan above the other Bimani games.

1401
01:36:55,232 --> 01:36:59,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not to say Konami can't put a little effort into Americanizing the game a little bit.

1402
01:36:59,915 --> 01:37:02,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I realize there's a lot of people who listen to this show that go...

1403
01:37:03,837 --> 01:37:05,438
[SPEAKER_10]: at the thought of a game getting Americanized.

1404
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:06,619
[SPEAKER_10]: But think about it.

1405
01:37:06,699 --> 01:37:09,981
[SPEAKER_10]: How did Guitar Hero and Rock Band become so successful?

1406
01:37:10,001 --> 01:37:11,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the songs were very American.

1407
01:37:12,142 --> 01:37:26,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if pop and music could invest the development time into maybe reinventing the interface to be a little more not so childish and getting some good American songs mixed in with the Japanese favorites, it could do well here.

1408
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:28,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1409
01:37:28,649 --> 01:37:28,889
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1410
01:37:29,089 --> 01:37:29,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, we've got to let you go.

1411
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Just take a couple more calls.

1412
01:37:31,211 --> 01:37:32,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I have another piece of cake?

1413
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:33,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course you can.

1414
01:37:33,774 --> 01:37:35,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1415
01:37:35,735 --> 01:37:36,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

1416
01:37:37,057 --> 01:37:38,258
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Bobby, the cake was a lie.

1417
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:39,198
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1418
01:37:39,799 --> 01:37:40,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1419
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:42,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I hung up on him.

1420
01:37:42,061 --> 01:37:42,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I hung up on Bobby.

1421
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:43,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Cake is a pie.

1422
01:37:43,642 --> 01:37:44,463
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Bobby's awesome.

1423
01:37:44,523 --> 01:37:44,803
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1424
01:37:45,404 --> 01:37:47,766
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try to get maybe one more call.

1425
01:37:47,806 --> 01:37:49,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any other last-minute stories here before we get to that?

1426
01:37:52,634 --> 01:37:54,816
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Misty Well hello Misty, how are you?

1427
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:19,698
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing good, even though I have to open in the morning, I'm still listening.

1428
01:38:20,199 --> 01:38:21,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to hear about that.

1429
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:25,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here, just for you, I have a caffeinated orange piece of cake.

1430
01:38:26,542 --> 01:38:27,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

1431
01:38:27,343 --> 01:38:27,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1432
01:38:28,383 --> 01:38:28,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom.

1433
01:38:30,425 --> 01:38:31,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Om, nom, nom.

1434
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:31,705
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1435
01:38:32,426 --> 01:38:33,106
[SPEAKER_10]: She sounds so excited.

1436
01:38:33,386 --> 01:38:36,328
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Misty, what question do you have for us tonight?

1437
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:43,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did Scope get screwed over tonight like it did way the hell back in episode 111?

1438
01:38:45,202 --> 01:38:46,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Skulk That is an understatement It's better than dessert

1439
01:39:16,155 --> 01:39:17,676
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had a band, I think I'd name it that.

1440
01:39:17,736 --> 01:39:18,677
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better than dessert.

1441
01:39:19,417 --> 01:39:20,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a lot of great band names.

1442
01:39:20,598 --> 01:39:23,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners quickly before we shut off for the night?

1443
01:39:26,342 --> 01:39:32,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Not really that I can think of, even though I bet I'm going to get my butt kicked for not asking another particular question.

1444
01:39:32,946 --> 01:39:33,666
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

1445
01:39:34,527 --> 01:39:35,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Another question you were supposed to ask?

1446
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:42,712
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanted me to ask about the fuck show.

1447
01:39:44,237 --> 01:39:46,658
[SPEAKER_14]: The fuck show happens when no one expects it to happen.

1448
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:52,483
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the apocalypse.

1449
01:39:53,544 --> 01:39:55,245
[SPEAKER_10]: The fuck show will sneak up on you eventually.

1450
01:39:55,265 --> 01:39:56,206
[SPEAKER_10]: See, here's my problem.

1451
01:39:56,446 --> 01:39:58,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I think we've hyped the fuck show too much.

1452
01:39:59,268 --> 01:40:02,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's going to be that funny when it happens.

1453
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:06,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's one of those things where halfway through part A we're going to be like, okay, we need to stop.

1454
01:40:06,634 --> 01:40:07,775
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, all right, fuck it.

1455
01:40:10,131 --> 01:40:10,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see.

1456
01:40:10,991 --> 01:40:13,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's what it's starting to seem like to me, too.

1457
01:40:13,252 --> 01:40:17,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I'm a little worried about fuck show, but it will... The fuck show will happen when Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

1458
01:40:19,935 --> 01:40:20,935
[SPEAKER_10]: We may hold her to that.

1459
01:40:20,955 --> 01:40:21,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck is finally out.

1460
01:40:21,635 --> 01:40:22,556
[SPEAKER_10]: We may hold her to that.

1461
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:24,676
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Misty, take care of yourself.

1462
01:40:24,716 --> 01:40:25,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, okay?

1463
01:40:26,697 --> 01:40:27,477
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty, you too.

1464
01:40:27,577 --> 01:40:28,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't fall asleep tomorrow.

1465
01:40:28,838 --> 01:40:29,098
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1466
01:40:30,796 --> 01:40:31,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy fucking birthday to me.

1467
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:50,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy, indeed.

1468
01:40:50,912 --> 01:40:51,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy fucking birthday to you.

1469
01:40:51,813 --> 01:40:52,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy.

1470
01:40:52,453 --> 01:40:52,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

1471
01:40:53,594 --> 01:40:54,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, look at that.

1472
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:57,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov pulled the tail out from between his legs and came back into the studio just in time.

1473
01:40:57,999 --> 01:40:59,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Look what the cat pissed on and dragged in.

1474
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see that Bitmania got third place?

1475
01:41:01,742 --> 01:41:02,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't deserve it.

1476
01:41:02,623 --> 01:41:02,863
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1477
01:41:05,066 --> 01:41:06,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Andrew's birthday.

1478
01:41:07,528 --> 01:41:08,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, fuck you, buddy.

1479
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:11,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for being here.

1480
01:41:11,131 --> 01:41:12,453
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be here next week, too, huh?

1481
01:41:12,493 --> 01:41:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1482
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:15,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you'll be here for the Tommy Tallarico interview.

1483
01:41:15,275 --> 01:41:15,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, goody.

1484
01:41:16,456 --> 01:41:17,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I so like him.

1485
01:41:18,358 --> 01:41:20,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Your final thought for tonight?

1486
01:41:26,245 --> 01:41:27,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I like DJ Maxx.

1487
01:41:29,087 --> 01:41:30,509
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought for tonight?

1488
01:41:31,049 --> 01:41:32,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Reject false icons.

1489
01:41:33,183 --> 01:41:35,426
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought for tonight, reject false MRIs.

1490
01:41:35,826 --> 01:41:36,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1491
01:41:38,169 --> 01:41:42,775
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is, I was listening to some all games radios, well, you know, the streaming stuff.

1492
01:41:43,136 --> 01:41:46,861
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of Tommy Tallarico music on there, on their playlist there.

1493
01:41:46,881 --> 01:41:47,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like,

1494
01:41:48,162 --> 01:41:48,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Every few songs.

1495
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,543
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a friend of the station.

1496
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:50,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1497
01:41:51,384 --> 01:41:52,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's also done a lot of stuff.

1498
01:41:52,604 --> 01:41:54,025
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just thought it was interesting.

1499
01:41:54,065 --> 01:41:58,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, he gives express permission for his music to be played.

1500
01:41:58,247 --> 01:42:00,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, they want to support people.

1501
01:42:01,129 --> 01:42:02,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, not knocking anything.

1502
01:42:02,109 --> 01:42:03,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying it's an observation.

1503
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:05,431
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an observation.

1504
01:42:06,638 --> 01:42:06,938
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1505
01:42:08,099 --> 01:42:14,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting as you have for the past six years, even when we weren't a podcast.

1506
01:42:14,943 --> 01:42:18,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those that have joined us along the way, thank you so much.

1507
01:42:18,806 --> 01:42:25,130
[SPEAKER_10]: As we push on to episode 300, our seventh year anniversary and beyond, we couldn't do it without you guys.

1508
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:25,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1509
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:29,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And remember, if you enjoy what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell two friends.

1510
01:42:30,093 --> 01:42:33,117
[SPEAKER_10]: about our show and it helps spread the word about independent radio.

1511
01:42:33,177 --> 01:42:34,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave us a review on iTunes.

1512
01:42:34,558 --> 01:42:38,722
[SPEAKER_10]: God, we could use some more of those five-star reviews and so on and so on.

1513
01:42:40,144 --> 01:42:40,765
[SPEAKER_10]: All that good stuff.

1514
01:42:41,185 --> 01:42:48,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you and good night and we'll see you next time, next week, Tommy Tallarico in episode number 285.

1515
01:42:49,314 --> 01:42:50,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to lose count.

1516
01:42:50,315 --> 01:42:51,616
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you're old when you start losing count.

1517
01:42:51,656 --> 01:42:52,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night.

1518
01:42:52,745 --> 01:42:53,265
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

1519
01:43:24,126 --> 01:43:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: and more.
