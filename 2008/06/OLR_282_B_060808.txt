DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.
So sometimes he runs long, sometimes he runs short, just depends.
But usually he can catch us around 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
Honestly, if you get here at like 4.45, there's a great block of programming on allgames.com.
It starts off with Kropotkin's UK Gaming News, moves on into the Bobby Blackwolf show, and ends with us, your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.
We're about to get into the gaming news here for Part B. I just wanted to say real quick, though, we got some guests coming up later this month.
I'm trying to arrange some interviews.
I don't have anything sealed yet, so I'll get back to you guys on that.
But in studio, one of our longtime OLR friends who hasn't been here in a long time is going to be back in two weeks.
Miklatov will be here visiting in two weeks.
So he'll be back on the program.
So I'll have to play high school musical stuff for him and get in the game.
Yes.
Maybe he can tell us what happened to Silent Hill Arcade.
He wanted to go to the whole happening thing that we were going to do.
I think I may postpone it a week so we can include him as well.
As well.
So, you know.
Because the happening, I think it's going to suck, but it'll be like a Lady in the Water.
We can either go all enjoy it or all make fun of it.
Well, since the chatters have no idea what you're talking about, you're trying to organize people to go see M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, right?
Yes.
I want to see it.
I haven't seen Lady in the Water.
Well, consider yourself lucky then.
But I liked The Village a lot.
I liked The Village too, and I thought people were really hard on that movie.
And I really liked The Sixth Sense.
I loved The Sixth Sense.
I even liked Unbreakable, but seriously, Lady in the Water was shit.
My problem with The Village, though, is they show you what the twist is, and then they're like, oh, pretend you didn't see that.
We're going to do the twist again.
Oh, just kidding.
It's actually what it was before.
That's my problem with it.
All right, so he'll be back.
I don't know if he can tell us anything about the latest and greatest at his video game employer.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'll be fun.
Because he doesn't really go ride roller coasters, but I told him he has to ride everything I want him to.
And he'll scream like a girl.
And we'll get YouTube to... Roller coasters are... I won't say great because I've only ever really been on one.
But the one I've been on is great.
California Screamin' California Screamin'
I don't remember.
That was a 3D ride.
No, it's not a 3D ride.
It's a video game.
It would cost you like three bucks to play.
I forget what it's called.
It's on Wikipedia.
It might have been since the last time I've been.
I haven't been.
Kadosho says Goose and Maverick?
Oh, no, no.
Sorry, that's a reference to Top Gun.
What the hell am I thinking?
Nice one.
It's something three.
I don't remember what it's called.
But anyways.
All right, let's get back into some gaming news.
Enough about our personal lives.
Let's talk gaming.
Yes.
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
and, um, it says apparently the integration with the MMO is going to affect, um, the stuff that happens on air.
So, for example, they gave, um, we can tell players that there'll be an alien invasion at a certain place in the game at a certain time and to be there, um,
All their friends and stuff would be ready at that time.
It says the outcome depends on them and then the battle will be part of the universe in the show.
So if they fail and they all die, then that will be reflected on the TV show, which I think is pretty cool.
It says both the show and the series will be set 80 to 100 years in the future and launched sometime sooner than summer of 2010.
When I read this or hear about it, I can't help but think, how awesome would the Battlestar Galactica game have been if it was this?
You know what I mean?
Like, that Battlestar Galactica thing they put on Xbox is, like, junk.
But there's a great game somewhere in the Battlestar Galactica universe.
And something like this is like an MMO where, you know, what happens in the show happens... That would be awesome!
I don't want to fuel the fanboy flames or anything, but wouldn't this be funny, just throwing it out there, if it was, like, say...
A relaunch of like Firefly or something like that, you know, and they have this whole universe that takes place at the same time and that kind of thing.
That'd be funny.
That would be kind of cool, but sadly I think the cast is all doing other stuff now, so I guess it could be like a new generation, but I don't know.
This doesn't seem like something that Josh Whedon would be all over, but you never know, I guess.
I doubt it.
It'd be probably something original.
Most likely.
Most likely.
Well, something else original and actually spotted in the wild this week, Duke Nukem Forever.
Yes, it exists.
It's out there, and you can actually see a little peek of it in this very strange place.
You would think if Duke Nukem Forever is going to launch its first footage ever, it's going to be like a one-up exclusive or a game trailer's hot spot.
The Office sort of shot the way The Office is
It's interesting.
But they kind of joke about Duke Nukem Forever, and it actually is Duke Nukem Forever that you see in the little show.
It's around the 4 minute and 15 second mark, and the most surprising thing about it, it actually looks kind of cool for that 30 seconds.
Hell of a way to hype something up, you know?
Hey, I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But they're actually... What the focus of the show is supposed to be is on the people developing the games and not necessarily the games themselves and celebrities who play games and stuff like that.
So that's their kind of spin on things.
It's less about the games but more about the developers and people behind the stuff.
Is it one of those things... I didn't watch it, I'll be honest, because I didn't care about Duke Nukem Forever footage because nothing will match the original to me.
But was it one of those things where, like...
Um, it's kind of like self-parody, where you really kind of have to be in the know to understand the jokes, or was it really accessible to any people?
I don't think so.
It wasn't even really parody.
It was just an interview show.
They just shot it in the same way as you would shoot, like, The Office or something like that.
Like, lots of cuts, you know, lots of just, you know, cutting between perspectives and stuff like that, and just talking to people, and there was, you know, some goofy moments, but it was no different than, like, say, like, okay, I don't want to, you know...
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what?
Here's the thing.
Sega was grossly overlooked by a lot of people at the time it came out.
I think a lot of people, if they realized... If you knew then what you know now about the Dreamcast, I bet you it would have done a lot better.
So it's okay that we highlight a lot of those games because a lot of people didn't give them a first look the first time around.
So, whatever.
That's it.
Next week is another Dreamcast game.
Fine.
Fine.
It's going to be like Power Stone or something.
Dreamcast games until we get to half.
Power Stone was awesome, wasn't it?
Power Stone was kind of awesome.
I would approve of that, actually.
And you can use your save files from the Japanese version on the US version.
Alright, well keep it a surprise until next week.
I might do that, I don't know.
Meanwhile, more gaming news, yes?
Call of Duty 4!
Didn't that sound awesome?
Anyway, they're getting a variety pack for free for the PC version that's actually going to be offered as part of a deal with NVIDIA.
And it's coming two months after, of course, everyone got it on Xbox 360.
However, like I said, they don't have to pay for it.
um it's uh Creek in Chinatown are the um highlights there are um uh new arenas they're supposed to be um Kill House and Broadcast um and uh another one is a patch 1.6 that uh fixes a server crash exploit and a bunch of bugs so there you go hooray bug fixes yay bug report
Speaking of fixes and tweaks, there's going to be some new tweaks in line for Team Fortress 2.
The next class to be upgraded, I guess, would be the Pyro class.
They are giving them a brand new, I believe, an axe, which is going to be kind of neat.
Also, there are rumors that they're going to be introducing a sniper class as well.
So...
That's neat.
I like to see games that they kind of tweak them as things come out to improve them and make them a little bit better.
Unfortunately, I have not jumped on the bandwagon.
I haven't really played Team Fortress 2.
Just mainly because I like a little single player in my multiplayer games.
But that's just me.
Anyways, the new weapon, as I was saying, is called the Extinguisher.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Meet the Sniper?
I was thinking of that movie.
Meet the Parents.
Meet the Sniper.
They're doing it.
and maybe the sniper's already in the game maybe I'm just an idiot because like I said I don't play this game but um they are giving the sniper like an intro they they're doing like they did little intro videos for all the different classes that are in this game so they have um you know little funny videos that kind of explain what the you know class involves and that kind of thing you're not supposed to meet the sniper they're just supposed to shoot you in the face when you're not looking well yes you can actually be shot in the face and live
A good sniper would aim for the neck or the forehead.
Well, apparently a druid knew where to aim to kill Onyxia all by his little self.
Actually, it might have been a female druid that did this.
Let's see.
Yeah, it was a female druid, Sirenia, that did this.
Was it really a female druid or was it a guy playing a female druid?
Probably a guy playing a female druid just like I am.
Here's the deal.
Onyxia, if you're not in the WoW, no.
Onyxia used to be the boss of one of those 40-man raids.
You know, she
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
which is kind of a feat to kill what was once a 40-man boss all by your little self.
It's kind of cool.
And I've got to say, you guys have been listening to this show long enough.
You know that I'm getting more and more into WoW, and I've been experiencing the endgame content in it, which is kind of new for me because when I played Final Fantasy XI for all those years, I never got to endgame.
That was all a mystery for me, but now I'm actually running the 10s and the 25s.
We've been in Serpent Shrine Cavern.
We've been in Tempest Keep.
Now, granted, I haven't gotten to Sunwell yet, but you know,
I feel like I'm making a lot more progression in this game than I ever did with any other MMO.
It's been very interesting.
The social dynamics of it is just... These games are something else.
Something else.
I would love to guest on a WoW show, by the way.
If you know of a Warcraft podcast that needs the Rob Roberts perspective, I'd love to go visit someday.
Because WoW is fun to talk about.
I'm not going to beat you over the head with it here on this show.
Well, in more World of Warcraft news, there is a 27-year-old gamer who is now in deep caca.
He met this girl playing World of Warcraft, fell in internet love, and they ran away together.
Less than three forever.
Forever.
Now the girl is 14.
Dope.
Oopsie.
She said she was 18 online.
They were actually found in Franklin County, Washington in a campground.
Wait, in a campground?
Like a KOA?
Is that what it is?
This guy and the girl ran off together to a KOA?
They went camping.
They were camping.
Waiting for that spawn.
Anyway.
That was really good.
Wah, wah.
Boo.
But, yeah, that's just really sad.
I mean, but what really way is there to control if someone lies or not on the game, right?
Well, I don't think that they were lying.
I think she was just touched in the head and, you know, decided, hey, I'm going to go meet this guy.
He seems really nice.
But, Mom, I'm in love.
Love does cause certain chemical reactions that have mimicked insanity.
I'm not joking.
I don't know.
I can see why he did that.
So what's the follow-up?
Is he in jail now or what happened?
Did they do it?
I don't know.
Let me see.
It actually doesn't say.
It just says he's in legal trouble.
Here we go.
He's in legal trouble.
He must have crossed the line.
There's likely... Which really running away together is kind of just cross the line.
None of that physical stuff really even needs to be involved.
Well, it doesn't say what exactly, but... It'll be some good old prison time coming his way, it says.
But he's, I think, out on parole right now.
Huh.
So... The question is, will she wait for him?
And M64 in chat changed his nickname to Chris Hansen and said, Hi there.
Why don't you have a seat right there?
Anyhow, now that's a dateline I'd like to see.
Catching the WoW Predators
You can't put a microwave next to your computer because it will interfere with your speakers.
You've got to put it a few feet away.
Bobby Blackwolf has an obvious point I didn't even think about.
He says he crossed state lines with a miner.
It's kidnapping.
Yeah.
So that's why he's in trouble.
He should have done his research first, dumbass.
There's campgrounds all over the place.
There's KOAs everywhere.
Frisbee says, what level did she say she was?
F.U.
of the Week
My FU of the week.
Well, really, I guess it's more, I guess, self-directed because I'm really nervous about something that's going to be going on tomorrow.
And I want it to go well.
And I don't want to do my nervous habit of talking, like, wildly while this is going on out of nerves.
So, FU to nerves.
Just out of concern for the listeners, though, it's not medical.
You're not in, like, any type of... I'm going in for a job interview, okay?
Well, I just want to clarify, people don't need to be worried about your health or anything.
You're fine there.
No, I don't have any type of degenerative diseases other than the walking pneumonia and the bogey-bogey flu.
Alright.
You didn't have to tell.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure listeners didn't get worried.
Loki, I guess F you to stupid workers at Roundtable for taking 40 minutes to make two-minute breadsticks.
What can I say?
I used to work there, so I know how long it takes.
It does not take 40 minutes.
And God, hire some more intelligent people for your front counters.
I hated that shit.
My FU of the week goes to my tooth.
I've been having all this pain in my mouth, one of my teeth.
I know it's probably got to have a root canal or something.
It's got to be a bad situation.
It's been hurting a lot.
I don't think I've ever had a tooth hurt this bad.
I'm like constantly having to take Tylenol or Advil or something.
And that means I'm actually going to have to go to the dentist on Monday.
Now here's the thing, you guys.
I don't like the dentist.
And a lot of people have those fears of the dentist.
It's not that I'm necessarily afraid of the dentist.
I just hate the dentist because dentists are like used car salesmen.
They try to sell you stuff you don't need.
I swear to God.
Not my dentist.
My last dentist.
Well, this is a true story about an experience I had with a dentist.
Maybe it's just HMO versus PPO.
Now that I have PPO, it'll be better.
But the last dentist I had tried to tell me I needed a replacement crown that was $1,200.
Now, granted, I did need the replacement crown, but what they neglected to tell me was that my plan would also cover a crown that was only $300.
So they were purposely trying to rip me off.
You know how, like, how much that turns me off to dentists in general?
Like, it makes me feel like I'm going to go buy a used car.
And I agree that, like, dental health is important, and I'm a fucking moron for not going to the dentist more often, but if that's the kind of treatment I'm going to get, do you understand why I don't like going?
Exactly, I totally understand.
Let's see it.
Well, I'll tell you later.
I told you earlier that I recommend my dentist to you.
Right.
They've never... And I haven't been to the dentist except for this one since I was in the third grade because we didn't have insurance for that.
We couldn't afford it.
Right.
I grew up Poe, okay?
Poe.
But...
The dentist that I go to, they give you cookies when you leave.
And they're good cookies.
How cute.
And the chairs, I fall asleep in their chairs.
They're memory foam.
And both of them are professional soothing.
Don't try to sell you shit you don't need.
They just put it out there and let you review it if you want it.
That's what I need.
That's what I need.
When I got all of my fillings done, they said, you have, here's a composite, here's this one, here's this one, here's this one.
This is what the pros and cons of this one are, this is the pros and cons of this one, this is the pros and cons of this one.
That's perfect.
Okay, if this, now see, I did end up, before Jamie knew I had problems, I just scheduled with somebody else, a co-worker recommended him, and he's like right around the corner, so, you know.
So I'm going to check it out and hope it's a little better because what I like about this is just one guy, his assistant, and the front desk lady.
It's not a big company, and those big companies tend to screw you more.
Well, also, this one's not a big one, and also if you go to my dentist, I get a $50 gift certificate for all of them.
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
But they do, because they're a small business, they offer perks to their clients.
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Rob, my dad wouldn't do that to you.
See, that's awesome that we know somebody whose dad's a dentist.
I would go to a family or friend dentist in a heartbeat.
I don't know any.
Unfortunately, SSJ100Matt's in New York City, and I can't exactly fly to New York to have my dental work done.
That's not very cost-effective.
That's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
You know, and it doesn't really matter.
I mean, we're not that rich yet to where we can fly out to New York to get your dental work done.
Maybe someday.
When we are, you know, rich internet celebrities, I will totally fly out to New York just to see SSJ100Mad's dad.
Definitely.
At least I know I can, like, trust him, because Matt will put in a good word for me.
Well, I'm not sure if this guy's a rich internet celebrity.
I know he's probably a celebrity, at least in the gaming world.
But Nolan Bushnell, he has a biopic that's being made about him.
and, you know, must we forget that he also, you know, founded Chuck E. Cheese.
Wait, they're making a biopic about Nolan Bushnell?
Yes.
What's the story there?
Just the fact that he invented all these things.
The story is Chuck E. Cheese is fucking awesome.
Or was fucking awesome.
I stand corrected.
The pizza sucks ass.
It doesn't matter.
They had cool arcades at one time.
In the 80s.
I say one time because all those arcades have been replaced with neon lights and ticket redemption machines.
They had that Ferrari game.
That Ferrari game's cool.
Anyways, so apparently... Dude, I should have my 30th birthday at Chuck E. Cheese.
How awesome would that be?
Apparently Paramount Pictures has picked up the movie and Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be attached to star in the movie as Nolan Bushnell.
That's kind of weird in a way.
How does he look like?
Makeup, I don't know.
Wait, BlackWolf says, Sky, they won't let you.
They won't let me.
What?
They won't let me.
You're a paying customer.
They won't let me have my birthday party?
I've had some friends try.
They got kicked out because they have no kids.
That's, that, it's not racist, but it's ageist.
So, Rob, Rob, Rob.
It's because I'm gay.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
No.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
What?
Why don't we invite people we know who have children?
Don't tell them you're having your birthday party.
Vandalists in chat says, Incredible Pizza Factory is more fun anyway.
I don't know if he's talking about John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
Here's the thing with John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
I would agree that it's a pretty rad place and that the food is a slight step better.
Only slight.
But here's the thing.
There's no animatronic animals.
And for that, it fails.
We could put Loki in a teagle costume.
That might be a little better.
I'm not an animatronic animal.
But it's my birthday!
I don't give a shit.
Ranma makes the best suggestion ever.
What?
Dave and Busters.
Too far.
Too far.
I used to go every year.
I don't care.
I went to Disneyland last year.
I want to go to Disneyland for my birthday.
Oh my God, Rob.
Let's go to Disneyland.
Okay, wait.
Black will finish this story here.
I know this has nothing to do with games, but I don't care.
Adults wanting to go to Chuck E. Cheese is a very important topic.
I mean, my friends were just trying to go there for lunch one day.
Company outing.
They were stopped at the door and told that they weren't welcome because they might have overrun the place for the kids.
Dude, we went there in college once and they didn't say anything.
What?
We went there on a weeknight once in college.
You didn't say anything.
We've walked in the... Don't ask me why.
Back when QZAR was open, someone actually ordered pizza from Chuck E. Cheese because they had takeout also.
Why?
I don't know.
Who wakes up, mm-mm, I'm craving Chuck E. Cheese crapola pizza.
I think it was, mm-mm, I'm Poe.
I have to say this.
And by the way...
When I was in high school, after I graduated, we decided to all go to Chuck E. Cheese's and I got humped by the person playing Chuck E. Cheese.
But he was also my boyfriend at the time.
Oh, well, okay.
Ha!
You were in the furries!
No.
Oh my god, you had sex with Chuck E. Cheese.
No.
Furry lover!
It was silly.
But, um...
But, you know, we went in there and, you know, I had a bunch of my friends there and, you know, we ate shitty pizza and played skee-ball until we puked and it was fun and no one ever did shit about it.
CC's Pizza is an East Coast chain anyways.
There's a CC's.
Oh, Black Wolf is referencing CC's Pizza.
I've never heard of it.
They have this thing that's on TV, they're talking about a buffet and stuff, and it's like five bucks, and the pizza looks like it's worth every penny.
It's like $5 cardboard shit pizza.
DJ Morpheus says, there are times that Loki sounds like an animatronic animal.
I also have to say, Patty said in our chat room that she got kicked out of there when she was 18 and had a kid with her.
Alright, I have a better suggestion for you.
It's not quite Chuck E. Cheese.
It's not quite...
Go to Scandia.
Not the Scandia in Sacramento, but the Scandia more towards Vallejo.
That's where you need to go.
Because there's no water park.
There's no Super Ghetto Kids running around.
It's just arcade, go-karts, and golf.
Like God intended it.
And they have tons of SNK machines and the Taito games.
I've never set foot in there.
I drive by it every time I go to the bay.
Oh my God, they're great.
Yeah.
Is that what they actually advertise on the sign, Loki?
Arcade golf and go-karts the way God intended it.
That's the way it should be.
All right.
So what, Leonardo DiCaprio, what?
He's going to play against Nolan Bushnell.
I think the movie is actually entitled Atari.
Interesting.
All right.
Orange Lounge Foodio?
No, now it's like Orange Lounge Chuck E. Cheese-io.
Anyhow, let's go to... We were talking about games, okay?
Nolan Bushnell created Chuck E. Cheese.
We were talking about Chuck E. Cheese.
It's still relevant.
This is a topic that always comes up on our show, actually, is whatever happened to Awesome Arcades?
Right?
Exactly.
They're a myth.
Exactly.
They've fallen into obscurity.
Well, it's sad that our kids are only going to have to hear stories about the arcades.
It's going to make it sound like what our parents told us about the sock hop.
Woo-hoo!
I don't want to ever hear about the sock hop.
Alright.
Okay, no more tangents.
Are you sure?
One more?
You good for one more, Jamie?
Come on, Tangent Lounge Radio.
That was the ferret's tangent.
Continue!
You're withholding, I know it.
I am.
Alright, EverQuest.
These are good cashews.
Orange Lounge EverQuestio.
Here's the deal with EverQuest.
Sony Online Entertainment, also known as SOE, or as I call it, SOE,
So has reactivated all of the gone players.
Basically, if you abandoned EverQuest some time ago, So has reactivated your account for two free months for both EverQuest and EverQuest 2.
That is everybody.
So if you left the game, it's time to come back.
Here's the thing.
So also included all of EverQuest's expansions in those accounts.
And you get bonuses to help your players that are out of date get them up to speed.
So kind of interesting there.
It's called the Living Legacy campaign.
So it's basically a way to try to sucker people back into Evercrack.
Hey, it's two months for free.
Just take a break from World of Warcraft and go grief some people.
There you go.
Mm-hmm.
You know what?
EverQuest is one of those games I never really got into because I got into Final Fantasy XI instead.
Like about the time I would have gotten into EverQuest, somebody showed me Japanese Final Fantasy XI and I was like, ooh, I'm waiting for this.
It's Final Fantasy and it's online.
What more do you want?
Here's what I worry about.
Final Fantasy is going to do something like this in the future and I'm going to be like, kind of want... Final Fantasy XIV.
Kind of want... Actually, it'll be just Final Fantasy Online or something.
All right.
Anyhow.
Stuff.
Yes.
And nonsense.
Like this nonsense.
No, I'm kidding.
Can I read a comment from chat real quick?
I got to say it because it's about the arcade thing we were talking about.
Siren in chat says, I only hear stories about awesome arcades and it makes me cry that there are no more.
I guess we have to realize there actually are, you know, I don't want to say younger kids, but, you know, teenagers that are now teenagers that were like, you know, too young to remember when we were teenagers that are already going through this.
It kind of sucks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They will never know how awesome it was to stand on a booster seat to play Crystal Castles
Well, it's like even when I was in high school, and I'm sorry for going off on another little thing.
That's what we do here.
But my little brother Matthew got hit by a car when he was six, and I was still a freshman in high school.
And I remember being dropped off at the mall to go see a movie with my friend Jennifer, and we went and hung out in the arcade for hours.
Exactly.
They used to have tilts in the malls and stuff like that.
Which is now a hot topic.
Well, Tilt got purchased by Namco.
I can tell you that because I worked for Namco Arcade when all this was going on.
But we had Aladdin's Castle and we actually got a cyber station later.
The Aladdin's Castle got turned into a cyber station and they opened an Aladdin's Castle in the mall across the street.
I worked at them both.
Anyway, that was actually right around the time that Arcade started sucking was when I quit working in one.
But anyway, I was there all day.
I was playing Samurai Shodown 2.
We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that day.
Rad.
Except that right when we beat the game, they freaking turned off the machine.
Fuckers.
Anyway, and these guys paid for me to play.
It was awesome because they wanted to do a four-person game.
They're like, here, we have money.
Okay.
They paid you to do a four-way?
Oh, baby.
I played Leonardo, so that's kind of cheating.
But anyway.
And I can't believe I still remember.
It's because my brother was injured that that really stuck out in my mind.
You know, we play air hockey.
Arcades, like only a few have air hockey anymore.
That is sad.
That is fucking criminal.
I mean, what arcade is perfect if you're not dodging air hockey pellets?
Speaking of perfect arcade, and I apologize for a moment to our international audience because this is a very local reference, but DJ Morpheus brought this up, and I have to know if Jamie's ever been here.
Did you ever go to Sam's Town in Cameron Park when it was up and running?
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
My God, that place was incredible.
Dan told me about the mineshaft.
Oh, that was, oh, I miss arcades.
He said that part of it was underground.
Yes, the mineshaft, it was a golf course.
The golf course started underground.
It was like a mineshaft and you would go upstairs.
It would go above ground after like the first three holes.
I've seen the remnants of it.
There was also, part of the arcade, there was a two-floor arcade.
Upstairs had all the little kids games like Noah's Ark and stuff.
And then downstairs, my God, they had everything.
Everything you can imagine.
Well, you know what, Arcade?
I think this is one of the last of the great arcades was the Birdcage Arcade that we had here.
Because the Birdcage... I'm sorry for people.
I know this is way out of that.
But this is where a lot of the new... We're having a moment, damn it.
Birdcage Arcade got all of the new fighting games.
All of them.
It didn't matter if they had to import them.
They got them.
and we actually well at the time and I'm not going to say his name because a lot of people in the DDR community especially doesn't but a friend of ours worked for Capcom for a while and it was funny watching him just completely hand people their asses one handed you know at any of the fighting games and it was just like
and that was like right when I first moved out here and then they started tearing down all the stuff that made the birdcage area cool like the theater where Rocky was and the arcade and they're trying to take out the element that was they said they're trying to make it safer for better clientele but in reality I think that it's hurt the business there
Outro Music
That's sad.
I know.
Sam's Town Old Person's Moment
All right.
No, it's just the fact that we had awesome shit and you don't.
Yes, we're reminiscing about better times, kids.
All right.
Except that I didn't walk to school both ways uphill.
So, whatever.
All right.
Sorry, Jamie.
You can do your story about... Oh, yeah.
It's a good story, right?
Strong bad!
Game.
The game is called Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People made by Telltale and it is going to be an episodic humor game but guess what?
It's delayed.
It's release has been pushed to July.
It says from the original release month into the next month so from June to July to polish it up a little bit.
Um
and uh I really want to play this game because it's awesome and I love the trailers for it but well it's obviously directed at me because it does say awesome people but here's this is attractive people here's the thing if you want to know a little well that's me too if you want to know a little more about the real insight to what's going on here listen to the very end of Bobby Blackwolf show this week when we're on I'm not going to spoil it but he gives a little more insight as to what could be possibly up with this delay so I'll leave you with that little teaser I will be sure to
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You and I. There was an interesting job posting over at Nintendo's official website.
The job posting was for a software hardware tester.
And their description of duties would be creating and executing a test plan for Wii's USB devices.
And it goes on saying writing, testing, documentation, whatever.
Anyways, but the whole fact is that
There's going to be Wii USB devices.
Storage, perhaps?
Hard drive?
OMG.
Maybe.
That would be smart.
Cross our fingers that that's what that actually means.
I hope so.
DMN in chat says, Sky is so old he owes Nolan Bushnell a quarter.
Nice.
Asshole.
Hey, DarkSakura, you know what else I miss?
Roller rinks.
Yes.
I've actually been to the one on Auburn, the Foothills Skating Rink, like in the last couple years.
I went there too.
And I'm still fucking awesome at it.
All right.
I'm not going to let this show get derailed.
I'm just kidding.
Rob and I are going to go roller skating next week and videotape it.
I almost played DDR on roller skates once.
I thought you didn't want to be on camera.
I won't be on camera.
I'll be videotaping it.
Fine.
I said I wanted to go ice skating, actually.
I've never been.
Oh.
I hate ice skating.
Must happen.
I love ice skating.
Anyway.
Rob's story.
Virtual Console, SNK, what more do you need to know?
There's lots of SNK stuff apparently heading to Virtual Console soon.
Not just Samurai Showdown, as you heard in Part A, but apparently Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury 2, Burning Fight, they are all apparently on their way to the Virtual Console.
This is the ESRB, of course, spilling all this.
Also on the list, Dig Dug is on the list.
Now that's probably not the arcade version, because you don't really see that on the Wii.
Probably the NES version, because it didn't really come out anywhere else that the Wii currently supports.
By the way, just so you know, also on the ESRB, it's completely unrelated, PlayStation 3, Ratings for the Last Guy, and Wipeout HD have both appeared, and hopefully that means that they are almost on their way.
So, we'll be looking forward to seeing those games soon, because Wipeout is kind of cool.
GameStop is going to be giving away a download of a free Pokemon app.
and forgive me if I mispronounce this but Deoxys which is a psychic type Pokemon that has four different forms.
If you've got Pokemon Diamond or Pearl you can go to a GameStop and download it and then they'll harass you about pre-ordering stuff.
But hey, you can have Pokemons.
I know, it looks freaking bizarre.
Very interesting comment from chat about kind of the tangent conversations we were having and it comes from Cyran who was kind of commenting earlier about being young and missing a lot of this.
Says something very interesting.
People Rob, Jamie, Matt's age had awesome arcades.
People in the 60s, my mom's generation, had Woodstock, The Beatles, The Summer of Love, and other cool things.
The majority of my generation just has the Iraq War, George Bush, and shitty music.
The otaku demographic at least has somewhat of a boom of the anime industry but that's about it.
That's a very, very good summary of it.
Here's the thing.
There's probably cool things about your generation, but you're not really going to realize them until like 20 years later.
That's the thing is that, you know, right now in this, you know, 2000s.
Did they ever come up with the name for this?
The O's?
The O-O's or whatever?
The O's.
The O's.
Okay.
Here in the O's, like the 80s are making a comeback.
Just like how in the 90s, the 70s are making a comeback.
Here's the thing.
When we start getting into the 10s, the 90s will make a comeback and all those things you forgot about will be cool again.
So then again it's going to be the late 60s, early 70s look again.
Perhaps.
You know, maybe in the 10s people are going to go back to the Victorian look.
Which people kind of did in the early 80s now that I think about it.
You know?
People in Europe?
Because if I'm correct, zero is referred to as aught.
Alright, whatever, whatever.
BlackWolf brings up a good point.
In 20 years, you may be telling young kids about how there was this internet where you could look up anything and read about anything and all information was equal, kind of referencing the net neutrality laws that are kind of making waves this week.
That's true.
You guys did grow up in the internet age.
That is something.
We didn't really have that when I was in early high school.
It was BBSs for life, bitch.
When we were some of these people's age, the internet actually was still military only and illegal for anyone else to network.
You totally just said when I was your age.
I mean, when we were little, it was true.
The internet's been in existence since, I do believe, 1972 or 74, around that time.
Whenever Al Gore invented it, right?
Whenever.
But it was military use only, and if anyone was caught networking in the early 80s or so, they actually could be arrested for it.
Hmm.
So, I remember my friend's dad, who's in his, I guess, 60s now, is an engineer, and he was talking about lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.
I thought that was pretty crazy.
But, yeah, anyway.
Just thought that might be a little perspective.
Lots of reminiscing tonight.
Let's move on with some more gaming news.
Sorry, kids.
Thanks for watching!
This year, though, I'm glad to see that it looks like around August they're going to be coming towards San Jose.
So we'll be able to hit that up, actually.
But, yeah, all over the place, including, you know, Canada, France, Scotland, United States, Portugal, and Brazil.
Brazil.
China, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Moscow, Russia, and Norway and Sweden.
So when they say world tour, they don't mean just like US and Canada.
They mean the freaking world.
Yes.
That's pretty cool.
I'll be fun to travel on.
Sorry, I was distracted because they're telling Commodore 64 jokes in chat and that's just all kinds of awesome.
But not as awesome as... Dude, I used to play Kix on an Apple IIe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The Boobs have their own value?
Apparently people noticed, and they actually have before and after shots here on various websites.
Well, you know what that means.
If something can be shrunk, it can be made bigger.
This is what I love, is that the company actually posted a clarification saying, quote, your breasts should be back to normal soon.
Well, thank you for saving the day.
By the way, it should be noted, man boobs were not affected at all.
Man boobs were safe.
Also safe this week, your emails, but not for much longer because we're about to turn DarkSakura loose on them.
Not for very much longer?
Not for very much longer.
I've got to open the mailbag.
No, I am.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Here we go, DarkSakura, take it away.
Stuff.
This is the best, this is like my email of the week just because of how it ends.
Hey Rob and DarkSakura, how goes it?
What about Loki?
Fine, thanks.
Say hi to Loki too.
F Loki.
My name is Tybon and I'm currently living in Kenya with my sisters.
I'm sorry, I'm not going to think of Power Thirst.
The region here is really poor, but we're fortunate enough to be able to afford and import video games from Europe.
We finally got hold of Grand Theft Auto, and I've been enjoying it a lot.
I don't have much to say, just wanted to say hi and let you guys know that you've got listeners all around the world.
I've been listening to the podcast every week for the past year now, and it's one of my favorites.
Keep up the good work.
Tybon.
This message is brought to you by Samara's Cafe, home of the never-ending dirt.
That's what I thought was awesome.
P.S.
Hope you read my email on the show.
It'll definitely make my week.
Okay, look.
I think you totally just got punked.
Here's the reason why.
Because I saw that email sitting in there.
Look at the sender name.
It does not match the person who says they are.
I know.
However, the reason why I thought it was awesome was because of the never-ending dirt.
I want this person to prove that they're actually in Kenya.
Somehow.
Send us a picture of Kenya.
You need to be standing in front of a building, flying the Kenya flag.
No.
Making a gang sign or something.
I don't know.
Making the OLR gang sign, whatever that is.
Take us a picture of Samara's Cafe.
Oh yes, we want a picture of Samara's Cafe.
Perfect.
And the never-ending dirt.
Yes.
But I'm still now... The other reason I'm thinking it's awesome is I'm also thinking of Power Thirst now.
And then I'm thinking, why would someone send us... And I apologize if we're not getting punked.
Just realize my suspicions.
A couple things about your email raised some eyebrows.
Why would you punk us with that?
You crazy kids.
Well, I'm thinking that it could be a nickname too.
So I'm going to suspend...
All right, well, that's right.
And I apologize profusely if you are the real deal.
If you are a legitimate person that lives in Kenya, you know what?
Actually, I'm going to save the email and I'm going to run it through an IP hunt.
Yeah, oh, there you go.
There you go.
Not that we are coming out and saying it.
It's just that we never expected to get email from Kenya.
But then again, we have a caller who calls from... We get Sweden, we get Argentina, we get... Why not Kenya?
Yeah.
Why not?
But I want somebody from Wales to call me so I can listen to a sexy Welsh accent.
Next email.
This is from Robert M. Just a quick thought about the Wii storage.
In addition to download virtual console and WiiWare titles, game saves seem to take a pretty big chunk of hard drive space.
Elebits, for instance, uses about 100 blocks and Brawl save files well over 120.
I assume the EA Sports games use large blocks as well, as most likely will the upcoming Animal Crossing game.
The GameCube one actually fills an entire gray memory card and comes with a spare card for that reason.
If it's a game that uses WFC and you can't move the save to your SD card for backup, I have no idea what should be done about this.
How many free blocks does a clean Wii with nothing but the disc channel and no game saves have anyway?
I have Mario Kart Wii from my Gamefly list and I haven't gotten online with it yet since I've been busy with other things, mostly Dr. Mario Online RX.
So anyone there or in OL Army has a chance to compete in that one?
He asked a good question.
I'm actually not sure.
How many blocks come on a brand new Wii?
Isn't it like 1,400 about?
Maybe the chat room is a little better.
I don't know.
I think blocks are stupid for measurement anyways on there.
True that.
Just fucking...
Hey, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hey.
I was just saying hey.
Hey.
Hey!
I'm a long-time listener from Canada known as D-Vay in the chat room.
Hi.
Hey, Jamie.
What do gay horses eat?
Hey.
Okay.
I'm not going to do the other joke.
So yes, listener from Canada.
I know Loki is all into PSP hacks and homebrew stuff like that, but recently I just bought myself a DS with a flash cart that I ordered online.
You got a ninja pass!
Anyway, my question to Loki is, have you experienced with DS homebrew before or do you even give a shit?
And so do you have any good links that can guide me in the right passage?
Thanks guys for making my weekly days and keep up the good work.
By the way, I was going to submit a GTA Radio entry if it weren't for my MacBook crapping out on me.
This message has been brought to you by Olive Garden Home and the never-ending flow of saggy granny birthday parties.
Nice.
You know what?
Fear not.
I'm still trying to get that portal win.
I am told that all games is going to be stepping up the number of contests that they do.
So there will be more opportunities to get in on the fun and big prizes eventually.
We should have a best message brought to you by contest for our emails.
We do have some stuff to give away and I think we're going to do it next week.
Okay.
I have an idea.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So yeah, that's the only problem right now.
Well, I know someone who does regular shipments of them, because if you order 10 of them, you get free shipping or something.
So next time this goes on, I'll let you know.
Well, it still doesn't make me not poor.
But yeah, I plan on buying one, because they look cool.
My whole thing before was, if I was ever going to buy one, it was just to play import games on anyways.
Thanks for watching!
That's pretty much the only interest I have on that stuff.
Team OE for that matter.
Play all import games sometimes.
I don't even really play that many import games.
Just mainly while I play Mario Kart, but that's not important.
There you go.
Actually, I'm going to be importing a game.
What could that be?
Because I have a new 2DX controller, I'm actually thinking about importing Happy Sky.
Okay.
I would pay you to build me an arcade style controller.
For poppin' music?
No, for... Well, for poppin' music, yeah, too, because I have a bunch of poppin' music, too.
I have the full-size buttons for it.
They're like eight bucks each.
Sucks.
Huh.
Well, next email comes from one of our listeners in the UK.
Hi, OLR, it's Guy.
Hi, Guy.
Hi, Guy.
That's cute.
Well, we did kind of talk about it in Part A that worldwide they've sold 8.5 million copies.
Was that worldwide or just here in America that they sold 8.5 million?
It was probably worldwide, right?
I think it's worldwide.
And 11 million have gone to store shelves.
So it's been doing very well.
And I would tend to once say the majority of that is happening in America.
And no, I'm not really hearing a lot of it's too much like the others.
I think, honestly, if it is too much like the others, that's okay for a lot of people here.
Well, honestly, and you know me, I wasn't at all interested in Grand Theft Auto 4.
But Dan's been borrowing our friend George's copy for a while, and he's been kind of getting into it.
Actually doing the missions, and his friend Will's been just fucking off on everything in that game and doing whatever the hell he wanted to and trying to get as drunk as possible.
He got so drunk on his character that he couldn't walk.
I thought it was funny.
But anyway, I've actually kind of gotten into watching them play it just because I like picking out stuff.
Like the Pisswater reference, that cracked me the hell up.
Here's something else to consider.
Grand Theft Auto has been selling systems here.
It has.
PlayStation 3s especially.
I don't know if it's name recognition or what, but there's a lot of people that have been picking out PS3s just for this game.
The Sony Grill.
And Blu-ray player too.
They go, ooh, it plays Blu-rays and Grand Theft Auto.
And Cook's Burgers.
so there you go thank you Guy bye Guy bye Guy
Hey guys, and girl.
Thank you.
I know, I'm awesome.
I get my own hello.
Anyway, I have been listening for about four years.
Oh God, four years.
And I hardly ever email you, but I thought this was worth it.
I work in an office job and often listen to music, and one time I decided I should listen to your podcast at work.
It entertained me so well for the three hours that it makes the rest of the day pass by incredibly slowly, and not even my music is working anymore.
I have even dipped into some archives just to have something to listen to that good.
I tried a few other podcasts, but nothing compared.
So keep up the good work.
I love the tangents, so never let them end.
Well, you got a lot of them tonight.
That's from Saltech.
Plus, he has the best email ever.
And...
He wants your email bad.
I gotta say though, we've actually kind of heard a lot about... In fact, part B has been kind of late the past two weeks and that's my fault.
And I've actually been kind of getting flack from the people who listen to us at work.
Like, why weren't we up for them to listen to Thursday or Friday at work?
So I know there's a lot of people that use us to pass the day by at work and I really, really apologize for that.
Of course, we are only three hours of show a week.
and you know hopefully maybe one day we'll be able to put out a little more other specials and things but if you're looking for other shows that are quality check out our family at allgames.com there's some great shows there will you like all of them probably not because the shows all talk about different types of games you know and there's but that's kind of what makes the network cool is that you have different gamer bases talking about all different types of things there's bound to be at least one other show on there you're like what were you laughing at Loki yeah
Nothing?
What is this?
Read an email, DarkSakura.
I have to spy on Loki and see what he's watching.
Well, I do want to thank Rob with 2Bs who sent us presents for our 6th anniversary.
And I will check them out in a bit, but I wanted to thank you very much for sending us your MyCookRewards.
Yes, and I saw that too, so big thank you.
We will definitely figure out a way to work those in to our anniversary show.
Here's the thing he's watching.
What?
Tiger Claw was telling me about this before the show.
What?
Someone has done a shot-for-shot remake of the introduction to the Naked Gun, but in Grand Theft Auto 4.
Using the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine.
They have recreated the intro to the Naked Gun.
And Loki's laughing his ass off over here.
I'm going to have to look for that when I get home.
Tiger Claw will give you the link.
Just...
TigerClaw, send it to the mailbag so Jamie can look it up at home.
Thanks, XXOO.
More emails?
One more.
One more.
Unamas.
One more.
This comes from Geekboy.
Hey guys, I'm about to get a 360.
If I like first person shooters, what would I get except for the obvious ones?
Any other game recommendations will be thanked.
Thanks.
Keep up the great work.
I'm sorry, what system was it?
360. 360.
360 first-person shooters.
Call of Duty 4.
I don't know.
You kind of, when you say besides the obvious ones, well, the obvious ones are the good ones usually.
That's why they're kind of obvious.
So you kind of, I don't know.
I guess, you know, you're probably asking the wrong people because I don't think a lot of us are super into first-person shooters as much as we are, say, RPGs and adventure games.
I'm really not myself.
But I will say this, Orange Box, if you overlook that, some great first... Not just Portal, but Half-Life, Half-Life 2.
Half-Life 2 was freaking great.
That's like the best first-person shooter deal.
It's a better deal than Halo, because Halo is just one game.
Orange Box is like five.
Otherwise, I know I might take a little flack for saying this, and it's not really for hardcore first-person players, but I liked Prey.
There was a lot about Prey I liked.
Saw says Iron Man.
And I think...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And it's like $10 probably at this point.
So there's my recommendation, I guess.
Well, I was checking this, and I think that it's because the Kenya email was a Gmail account.
It's reading an America IP.
But Google is international, and they do run out of the United States.
We'll see.
Send us a picture of this America cafe.
We're waiting for the picture of the cafe.
Or either... Look...
either send us a picture of the cafe or fess up that you were fake and just tell us why.
I mean, we don't care at this point.
We read the email, but I've got to know why that.
Why did she have to read that?
I mean, was it a dare?
I don't get it.
All right.
Anything else?
I'm checking the inbox to see if we got a... No, but we did get one.
This is Pokemans.
I'm going to read it next week.
All right.
So tune in next week for more Mailbag.
Hey, speaking of interactivity, the Skypline will be open very soon, but we got two more stories for you before we get to the Skypline, which we're kind of keeping short tonight.
We're trying to keep our show a little short tonight because we've got other things we've got to get to for tomorrow, but we will get at least a couple calls in after these two quick stories.
Loki.
Well, Home is coming out this year, so says Sony.
Um, but, they say now it's going to be released in the fall as an open working beta.
I guess that's a fancy way of saying, well, it's not really done yet, but we're releasing it anyways.
Really, when they think about it, I guess it's kind of like every single game that comes out nowadays anyways.
Well, also, pretty much anything Google does and Google launches is a beta.
So it's kind of like that thing where it's like, well, we're launching this and it's going to have all these awesome features, but don't blame us if it sucks because it's a beta.
No, I don't think so.
That may work for Google because they're always improving their services and stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Whatever.
At least it's coming out, I guess.
And either way, people have been playing it in beta.
I don't know.
To be honest, I don't think Home is going to be as big as they're hoping it's going to be.
I think people are going to find it as being a big waste of time.
But we'll see.
Sorry for the dead air there.
I was typing some things in chat real quick.
He was typing of the dead.
Yes, I was typing of the dead, and I won.
I got 100%.
Resident Evil 5 you know they've kind of been accused of being racist and so on I don't know if you heard about that but you know because in the trailers and stuff you know whatever but here's the thing is that the producer of Resident Evil 5 Jun Takushi has actually denied saying there's nothing racist about this game y'all are just misunderstanding the original trailer which I would believe because people are too freaking sensitive nowadays come on anybody can be a zombie regardless of race can we all agree on that I agree
Oh, go ahead.
What?
Yeah, in the Japanese Biohazard, when you go in the room, and I hope this is not Chris' bloodline and everything, and so you go into the other room, there's a zombie chewing off the neck of one of the team members who had been in there before, and his head pops off and rolls off, and it looks like Michael Jordan.
Or it's supposed to, in however PS1 graphics did.
They cut that out on the US version in that cinematic.
They also cut out the part with Chris lighting up a cigarette with this huge lighter.
I've got a Japanese version of Biohazard, so it's no big freaking deal.
But I thought that that was the same thing.
Hmm.
Well, I mean, speaking of characters and stuff, there is a new character in the game who is a black female who's going to have a role in Resident Evil 5 as somebody you can actually include.
And see, here's the thing, is that the question was asked, did you put this character in because of the fact that the trailer showed that you're blowing up people in Africa and that they're all the zombies and stuff?
And Takushi said, no, she's pretty much been there in the beginning.
In terms of the reaction, we're in the business of entertainment.
We didn't set out to make a racist game or a political statement.
We did feel there was a misunderstanding about the initial trailer, which probably was just some people being a little bit oversensitive, I think, because, you know, anybody can be a zombie, right?
But you don't see a lot of fat zombies in Resident Evil, do you?
Yes, you do.
Do you?
There was a cop in the first one who died, and then he came back as a fat zombie.
Okay.
Yeah.
I know my video game trivia.
Thank you.
All right, we're going to go to the Skype line here, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But first, I'm told that there is a very important voicemail we're supposed to play that was left in the box last night.
And I'm just thinking about what goes on Saturday.
It was overnight.
No, I'm thinking about things that go on on All Games Radio on Saturday night.
Oh, sweet.
And I'm a little bit worried about this one.
So I'm going to go play this voicemail and kind of hope that it's not too strange.
We'll see.
It's downloading.
I remember that.
That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.
I remember that commercial.
And that's 30 seconds of all your lives you'll never get back either.
Well, every second of your life is a second you'll never get back.
Tiger Claw says we just got bucket rolled.
What the crap?
Is that the new thing now?
Is that replaced Rickrolling?
By the way, by the way, I went to a sushi restaurant last night.
My friend Jim, his birthday, he's turning 30.
Happy birthday, Jim, if you're listening.
Here's the thing.
They actually have a sushi roll called the Rick-O-Roll.
Can you believe that?
They actually now have sushi called the Rick-Roll.
Did you get a... Screw all of you!
Don't they have Ricky-O as like a...
Asian, Kung Fu I don't know, but of course the whole table looked at it and went, ha ha ha, Rickroll, ha ha ha And I was just like, Rickrolls need to die in a boat fire Underwater volcano, that whole thing Alright, we got calls We got calls, let's go to the Skype line Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
RavensDolphin, long time no hear Well, hello RavensDolphin Damn, it's been a long time since you've managed to be the first caller here on OLR What is on your mind, my friend?
First off, what the hell have you been up to?
DeadPixelLive
All right, well, there you have it here on All Games Radio.
What time do you start?
You just start whenever All Games finishes?
Yeah, whenever they reach out and they said, all right, they pull the plug, and then we start with our... The other host is Derek H. Very cool.
I don't think Derek H. likes our show, though, which makes me a sad panda.
Don't worry.
One half does.
Why doesn't he love me?
I want to know why doesn't Derek H. love me.
I don't know.
It ain't my fault.
I love him.
You pass along that message.
We here at OLR, we love Derek.
We hope that that love is reciprocated.
Alright, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
Two things.
It's about Microsoft and the Blu-ray thing.
I think it's dumb.
Why is it dumb?
Do you think it's BS or do you think the idea itself is dumb?
I just think it's dumb in general.
It's like, hey, MGS4 is coming.
It's like, we must combat it with a Blu-ray player.
It just feels like it shouldn't be necessary until the Xbox 720.
Yes and no, because right now, why are a lot of people buying PlayStation 3s right now?
I kind of said this earlier in the show, because it plays Grand Theft Auto 4 and Blu-rays, whereas Xbox 360 only plays Grand Theft Auto 4 right now.
It's not really a movie system.
Yay DVDs, but everybody has a freaking DVD player at this point, right?
Not a lot of people are looking for that in their systems.
And people, I think, the normal average Joe, I'm not a gamer, but I enjoy the occasional violent video game, right?
They don't know about all this, like, download exclusive Xbox 360 stuff.
They don't know about all that stuff.
They just think it's the same damn game.
I agree.
So, you know, just something to consider.
I just, I agree with Loki when he said, if they bundle, like, a new one in, I feel like that's suicide.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because Rainbow Bright, it's all dark and gloomy, and you have to fill the world with color, and this is what the game does.
You fill the world with color.
Nice.
Who was the evil guy in Rainbow Bride?
I can't remember his name.
Murky and Lurky.
I'm sorry, I was thinking of the peculiar purple pie man.
Yeah, I keep thinking of Strawberry Shortcake too.
They're so easy to get confused, I guess.
Alright, forget it.
Alright, Evans Dolphin, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
Dead Pigs Alive, right after All Games Interactive.
Plug, plug, plug.
There you go.
Have a good one, buddy.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Spazinator.
Spazinator.
Need to go buy on the PlayStation Network.
Awesome.
What's on your mind, Spazinator?
Yeah, a couple things.
Much of which you kind of sort of touched on on tonight's show, especially in part one.
Now, I do have one concern about Soul Calibur 4, which is going to be coming out next month with all the characters from Star Wars and whatnot.
If you think about it, you know how in all the Star Wars movies supposedly the lightsabers pretty much cut through 99% of everything out there?
Like limbs and walls and stuff like that?
In theory, if they want the Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur IV to be totally active and whatnot, wouldn't they be way overpowered and whatnot?
You know, like
You know, cut off people's legs and, you know, totally break down the characters' weapons and whatnot?
Well, I think, you know, they're probably just going to balance it.
Just like, you know, when things have crossed over before.
Like, you know, when Spawn and Link and all those characters showed up before.
You know, they just kind of made it work.
They just balanced it.
And that's just what they're going to do here.
I mean, and all these kind of crossover games.
I mean, like Capcom versus X-Men.
I mean, certainly superheroes would overpower these, you know...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I have no doubt that the game's going to be good.
I'm kind of both a Soul Calibur fan and a Star Wars nut, so that thought did kind of cross my mind like a week ago.
So you're okay with this?
Because a lot of people in our chat room earlier were kind of like, oh, why can't they just make Star Wars its own game?
Why do they have to have all these Star Wars characters?
You're okay with both kind of living together in the same game?
Oh, yeah.
It was just that little...
TigerClaw made a very similar observation to what you're saying.
He says in chat here, That's one of the things I noticed when I saw the gameplay footage of Vader and SoulCalibur IV.
He can literally impale an opponent and throw them.
Normally, a lightsaber would cut through someone effortlessly.
Oh, yeah.
So there you have it.
It's a low wattage.
Now, Spazinator, do you think they ought to make a new Star Wars fighting game?
Like, if this does really well, do you think Namco needs to be paid a lot of money to make a new Star Wars fighting game?
Like, we'll just pretend the other one never happened?
Well, actually, now that you mention it, I did buy the first one for the PlayStation 1 when it came out, and I wouldn't necessarily say it was horrible, like E.T.
for its 2600 badge.
but it wasn't exactly game of the year like Final Fantasy 7 great either, you know.
It was kind of like middle of the road for me.
But I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to a new Star Wars fighting game, though.
Hopefully this is Namco putting their feet in the water a little bit and seeing if it's possible.
I don't know.
I don't know.
We can hope.
Go ahead.
Oh, go ahead.
Sorry.
I was just going to say, is there anything else you want to talk about before we go, Spazinator?
Yeah.
I know that you've kind of gone away from Final Fantasy XI and more into WoW, but that was notwithstanding, have you heard anything about a fan festival like what they had in Anaheim last year?
I have not, but from what I understand, Squeenix usually announces those things pretty last minute.
I mean, not like, you know, the day before, but they'll only give like two months notice.
Whereas with Blizzard, you know, they've already announced, hey, BlizzCon's gonna happen, mark the date.
And maybe it's because BlizzCon gets a hell of a lot more people, not just because they have WoW, but they also have StarCraft and, you know, some of those other, you know, powerhouse games and Diablo 3 rumors are enough to get people to go too.
I haven't heard anything, though.
Even though I left Final Fantasy XI, I do keep tabs on the news just to see if there's anything really cool I'm missing out on.
I don't know.
I spent so much time with that freaking game, you can't help but just kind of be curious about it.
It's almost like a bad relationship.
You can't help but wonder, whatever happened to your ex?
You know what I mean?
Honestly, I've been playing the PlayStation 2 version of the game for...
Two, two and a half years now, and I'm practically addicted to it.
Even now that I got to play season three.
And the reason I ask my question is, in theory, if they hold the Fan Festival this year, this will be the first year I can actually afford to literally go cross-country and go to the Fan Festival.
And from what I've been told, some of my friends are going to be over there, and I've been just dying to go to the festival.
If they hold it in California, I might actually try to go.
Because it might be a lot of fun.
Especially if it's within driving distance.
I think they had one of them in Santa Cruz.
And that's not that far.
So I could have gone to that.
But I just didn't know about it until after it already happened.
Because it was when I was not really playing.
As a video game journalist, to report on the event.
Well, thanks for taking my call.
You are welcome.
We like hearing from people that we don't get to hear from very often.
So take care, alright?
Oh, I just thought of something, and then I'll let you go.
You know, earlier in the show you were asking about that new Commando 3 game.
Yeah, that's going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 next week, and it's already out for the PS3.
I already got the game, and I don't know if there's going to be a difference between the two versions, but at least the PlayStation 3 game is pretty good.
Well, that's a good sign.
Yeah.
So if you guys got the 360 or the PS3, I would seriously suggest investing the $10 for the game.
I will definitely check out the demo and see if it's worth it because I am tempted by the beta of the new Street Fighter because I do heart Street Fighter.
But yeah, I guess that's true.
It's already out on PS3, so it's good to know that the game's not bad so that you're not wasting your $10.
But we'll see when that demo comes out.
All right.
Well, have a good one.
All right.
Thanks, Spazinator.
Thanks for your call.
Take care, buddy.
All right.
We'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we're going to call it a night.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Oh, wow.
It's Legend of Zaku.
Hey, Legend of Zaku.
No show is complete without a call from Legend of Zaku.
Damn right.
It's been far too long.
What is on your mind, Zaku?
Nothing much, just basically just enjoying all my usual games on my 360, like Grand Theft Auto 4 and whatnot.
That's right, you upgraded to a 360 not too long ago, huh?
Yeah, it's been like about six months.
What kind of games have you been playing?
Grand Theft Auto, obviously.
Kicked the shit out of Call of Duty 4 on Veterans, so that boosted up my achievement scores.
But besides that, I'm just, you know, just trying to scrap as many games as possible since, you know, money's kind of tight right now.
But, you know, it hasn't been so bad.
You know the new unlock code for DDR, you know, for Supernova 2 came out, right?
I did hear something about that, that there's some new unlocks.
Tell us about it since we didn't report on it tonight.
I don't know, it's like I spent the better part of Friday and Dave and Buster's trying to do that shit and it...
We weren't able to.
Huh, it has to be hooked up to the EMUs.
Are you sure?
Oh, snap.
So, can't.
Are you sure?
Because that one actually was an unlock code in which you actually have to input certain, you have to hit certain arrows after you enter your credit.
I still think it had to be hooked up to the EMUs, if I remember correctly.
Why is that?
I don't know why.
I don't know why they have this kind of... Does it download the songs or something?
I think it's because there was some other competition thing that went along with some Zouken Battle 3 or 2 or something like that.
I don't know.
From what I heard, other machines besides the one in Illinois, which is the only EMUs in the country, managed to get the code.
Managed to get it working.
Well, then your machine doesn't like you.
Well, it just has shitty pads, but that's besides the point.
Yeah, just looking through...
I don't know, it's just been a rough...
I still try to load DDR Freak and look at the forums once in a while, just keep tabs on what's going on.
Are there any big tournaments or big things we ought to be looking forward to?
Maybe...
What about Digital Life?
Usually you're calling in Digital Life, Digital Life.
Is that happening this year?
It hasn't been confirmed yet.
That's the thing.
Until I get confirmation, I'll let you know.
But right now, I'm not going to jump the gun quickly when...
We'll tell you when we're ready, dang it.
That's what they're saying.
We'll tell you when we're ready.
Right.
All right.
So that's it.
I'll let you know once I hear word of it happening.
All right.
Sounds good, buddy.
Hey, we've got to wrap up and close the show.
You got any parting words for our listener tonight?
Listeners?
Just hack your PSP.
Hack your PSP.
All right, buddy.
Have a good one.
That's some great final words.
Hack your PSP.
It's awesome.
This naked gun thing is great.
Did you check that out?
It's awesome.
Alright, we're going to do some last minute stories.
We're actually going to start with Jamie tonight.
I just think that he who shall not be named more news about him is that he's been well it's not that it's official yet but he's been recommended for a 10 year disbarment for his 27 misconduct charges also it should be noted that two of his Supreme Court cases were actually dismissed with prejudice meaning he can't file it again so I'm
Hope the judge says yes and goes for the 10 years.
Again, this is about he who shall not be named.
Well, he was very... Oh, yeah, they wouldn't let him read his... Yeah, his long argument or whatever, which pretty much called everyone a dumbass and stuff like that.
Real class.
Yeah, the judge didn't allow him to read.
And he had prepared it in advance, of course.
I was like, whatever, dude.
So, yeah.
I think it's going to go through.
Prepared my speech on why I'm awesome.
You want me to read it?
Anyway.
Alright.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
XBOX Live Multiplayer and Feature 2-Person Online Co-op
and that's all in GamePro's July issue which should be out soon.
Also, we were talking about movies earlier with Leonardo DiCaprio being in the Atari movie.
Well, now there's another movie being made, Kane and Lynch, with Bruce Willis going to be starring in it as Kane Marcus.
Or Adam Kane Marcus, I guess.
Which is weird because Billy Bob Thornton apparently is in talks for the role of Lynch.
So it's like...
That's going to be a classy movie.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Sony has apparently stopped production of a couple games that they were showing off, hell, I think before the PS3 even came out, including Eight Days and The Getaway.
Eight Days, I believe, was that one that they showed the demo for, including all the bullets ripping up a car and that kind of stuff.
Oh well, not coming out I guess.
The Bioshock movie, which we talked about I believe last week, has been confirmed of course as part of the conference call following Take-Two's second quarter earnings.
They addressed the...
I don't know.
And then finally, I forgot to talk about this earlier, Rock Band, the download content for this coming week.
They've got the MTV 2-pack, which is going to feature... Crap.
Yeah.
Moving to Seattle by The Material.
I've never heard of them.
A Clean Shot by The Myriad.
Bullets and Guns by Them Terribles.
Those are each...
Available for 80 Microsoft Points or 240 points for the entire pack.
And finally, an individual song, Girls Who Play Guitars by Maximo Park for also 80 points.
Alright.
Is that it for Last Minute Stories?
That is it.
All right.
Well, then that's going to wind down.
Oh, and to answer a question you had earlier.
Hey, wait a minute.
You said, okay.
Sorry, this is answering a question.
This is not a story.
All right.
One block equals 128 kilobytes.
So if you do the math there, I believe it's 500 blocks.
I don't know.
All right.
Anyhow, we're going to wrap up the show now.
It's time to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Laundry.
But not before we get everybody's final thought.
I will start tonight with my final thought.
And my final thought is that these Haribo Happy Cola gummy candies that are like the little bottles of cola are like the yummiest things in the world.
I love these things.
And they're nonfat, which is awesome.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I want food.
Real food.
The kind you can eat and digest.
Yeah.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is, goddammit, I gotta get 100% on Grand Theft Auto 4.
I have to basically unlock the special ability of Paki.
Basically, when you get your friendship up a certain percentage, he'll allow you to call him to give you cars with bombs in them.
and that will kick me over to 100% and I get the achievement and I'm done with the story.
Cars with bombs.
Awesome.
Alright.
