00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio for this live part B

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
That we're taping on June 1st of 2008 and for those of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,760
You're probably going hey, wait a minute. I I'm not hearing you guys live. We can always join us

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:21,380
We tape live on all games comm that's all games radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time 9 o'clock Eastern

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,720
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show the man in Atlanta, Georgia tapes his show live on Sunday nights as well

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,760
And if you haven't heard his show, you really should check that out in iTunes

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,520
So we make appearances on the show every week Bobby's kind enough to have us on the show to do a little cross-promotion

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Speaking of taping the show live you guys in the podcast didn't get to hear this

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,920
But we were actually listening to some of the tracks from the Metal Gear Solid 4 soundtrack during the break there

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,240
What did you guys think of it? I thought some of it sounded pretty awesome myself epic soundtrack soundtrack is epic

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,640
Yes, epic soundtrack is very epic Loki. I know you were good watching some more scenes from postal there during the break

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
but yeah, I'm I'm a

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,080
Minute or an hour 11 into it and it's an hour

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
47 minute movie out of curiosity those you guys in chat chat that orange laundry calm. Did you guys enjoy that?

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,120
Let us know in chat. All right. Meanwhile, we are gonna get back into some gaming news here on this part B

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,400
There's plenty of stuff to talk about. I don't think we mentioned the Wii at all in part a so and I got by the

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,760
Way, I got a game this week boom blocks

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,680
One of my friends kind of hooked me up with a copy of it looked completely legitimate

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,440
He just had some inside connections got me a pretty cheap copy of it

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,760
So, uh, I'm looking forward to checking it out cool

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,280
So I'll have a review on that next week, but we're not gonna talk about boom blocks right away, right? No

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,980
No, we're talking about something that's a little bit more interesting. I guess

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,080
Portal everybody loves portal. Well now you can play portal on your DS or a version of it

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,800
It's a game called still alive DS. It is a 2d portal home brew game

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,400
you remember the

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,240
Flash game that they had out there that was kind of similar to the portal

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,280
Well, this is kind of similar to that flash game a little bit more cartoony

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:11,600
but if you own a flash card or means of putting a homebrew on your DS, you can download this game for free and

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
It looks pretty awesome actually

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,400
Download it now before lawsuits. I'm actually going to because I have a ninja pass. So

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,320
definitely worth checking out it uses the

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,040
Touchscreen as well as you know, some of the face buttons on there for launching different portals and stuff. So pretty cool

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I will have to play a dark soccer's copy because I don't think I'll be getting to check this out. Otherwise

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
But it sounds interesting. Yeah

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,120
I'm definitely gonna definitely gonna download that cuz you know me and my my minor portal obsession

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,000
So I'll have to and folks in chat are playing it right now. Nintendo maniac 64 says ironically. I'm playing still live DS right now

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,840
Let's have T says it's rather hard to control. How the hell do I shoot the orange one?

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,880
maybe you guys can put your heads together and if you want ones by pushing down on the directional pad or

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,800
I

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,000
want to say a or see if there's instructions and read them down or a and

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,240
The you know, two shoulder buttons are the blue portals. So that's how you do it

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,960
Well, thank you very much. You're like a Nintendo game counselor all of a sudden. I love it

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,680
Well, they had it they have the screenshots of our I guess artwork shots of the controls. So they're all over the internet

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
All right

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Well the latest issue of Japan's for me to magazine has given us some insight as to what's going on with the Sim City

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,760
Series here's the deal Sim City creator is gonna be a new game in the Sim City vein and

47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,000
It's gonna be coming out for the Wii and the DS

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:48,880
it's gonna be coming out September 22nd of 2008 for North America and September 19th a little bit earlier for Europe and the

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,400
Japan and other Asia regions and here's the interesting thing

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Is that the Wii game what you can do you can draw your own rivers or tracks using the Wiimote?

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,440
You can actually change different styles of your buildings as well

52
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,400
You can do like a Chinese style building an Indian design kind of interesting

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
You can also make buildings made out of candy

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
or Chris

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Jamie got so excited. She dropped the mic

56
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,840
She was like a candy palace. I was like saying, you know, you can do like a gingerbread house

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,640
Well, it makes me think of the opening scene or one of the opening scenes in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the newer one

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,080
Did you see the newer one with Johnny Depp? Oh

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,540
It's great. That's all I'll say. There's a scene with a chocolate Indian Palace. It's great

60
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,940
Anyhow, also it uses the Wi-Fi connection feature so you can show off the game to friends

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,100
So that's kind of cool, especially when you draw those rivers shaped like penises

62
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,660
Which I'm sure a lot of you will be showing each other. There you have some pervy people. There you go

63
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,420
So I'd be called like chocolate check that out

64
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,300
I I loved the first SimCity game that SimCity

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,580
2000 and beyond was a little much for me, but I loved the first one

66
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,100
But you know when it gets into too much micromanaging I get like in SimCity 2000

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,540
You had to manage the water system with the pipes and everything. It was too much too much

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,660
That's why they hire, you know different people to do those jobs blade 3 and check out very excited

69
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
He says awesome candy rules

70
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,860
Candy does rule you can have Candyland. It does depend. Yeah, you could actually make Candyland

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,060
That'd be great. With peppermint stick. You could actually make Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. That would be so awesome

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,020
Yes, I want a river of chocolate. That's right. And I want a wall that tastes like snozzleberry

73
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
There's no such thing

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,220
Okay, anyway

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
for people interested in other

76
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,580
Culinary related games that are actually related to food

77
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
There's going to be another Cooking Mama

78
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
World Kitchen

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,460
To be released later this year around October ish

80
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,140
They actually have Majesco has a coming soon

81
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,820
With a release date of October 30th. It's also

82
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,220
That's replacing dinner with friends. As you remember there's Cooking Mama 2 on the DS

83
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,120
This was going to be Cooking Mama 2 on the Wii

84
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,940
But I don't know if they changed the title or actually going to change the game

85
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,780
But it was supposed to be coming out in June now. It's in October. They need to have Redneck Cooking Mama. Look, I'm

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,900
They have a game. We make fish sticks. They have a game called Order Up. My roommate just ate that for dinner

87
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,460
Did you smell that inside the house or something? That's hilarious. No, actually

88
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,900
Fish sticks. Funny you should mention that. I walked in the house. I'm like it smells good in here. What did you make for dinner?

89
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,780
Fish sticks. You said fish sticks. No, I said funny that you should mention like a Redneck Cooking game because they're gonna have

90
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,300
Order Up, which is basically like Cooking Mama, but you're working at like a fast food restaurant.

91
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,700
Yeah, they need to have Truck Stop Diner. That would be great. Don't they have Diner Dash? Yeah, same thing. No

92
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,540
All right

93
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,820
Anyhow, sorry. Look, I just hope Cooking Mama Wii kind of blew chunks compared to the DS version

94
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
So I really hope they do a better

95
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,780
DS to Wii port this time. The closer you are to the screen the more tight the control would be. That's how I say.

96
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,420
It's... I did not enjoy Cooking Mama on the Wii, although I own it and I'm kind of upset I do

97
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
anyways

98
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,380
Now the Wii was... the Virtual Console is supposed to be getting MSX games for quite a while

99
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
Finally, Japan has had their first

100
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:33,540
MSX game release and it's a game called Aleste and what's kind of interesting though is that

101
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:40,900
is that there's been some additional options to this game that no other Virtual Console game has including the

102
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,980
MSX option menu which allows you to select between

103
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
The

104
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,580
MXX hardware-based music and the more advanced FM music that

105
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,980
Back when the MSX was actually a console was in add-on card

106
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,380
So that's pretty cool that you can actually do this in the game by

107
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,780
pressing the minus button

108
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,420
I actually just think that it's cool that that they're getting that game because it's a really freaking good game

109
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,540
And you can also do I guess there's some button change options as well thrown in there. So I

110
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,860
Don't know that's kind of neat that they're adding all these options almost like an actual emulator for this

111
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,860
I don't know why they don't do that with

112
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Any of the other games that come out?

113
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Being a little lazy.

114
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,540
I hope we get Gardic with the deluxe treatment

115
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
You knew I had to throw that out there

116
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,340
Some of our longtime listeners was getting really sick of some of our little obsessions

117
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
Alright, anyhow, um

118
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,980
Toki Tori is a game that is coming to the North American Virtual Console

119
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,020
WiiWare, I guess it's not really Virtual Console, but you know WiiWare

120
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,540
It's a 2d puzzle game and it's going to cost you

121
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,220
1,000 points or 10 bucks. So there you have it

122
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,940
Apparently this game has been fairly well reviewed. It's a little I didn't like it. You didn't like it you played it

123
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,060
Yeah, can you describe it because I don't know much about this game

124
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,880
It looks like I know I look at screenshots and I go it looks a little load runner ish to me sort of you collect

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,460
The eggs basically and then that's pretty much it. I mean you can hop around

126
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,700
Jump different platforms with like motion controls and stuff like that. I don't know. It might be cool later on

127
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,780
I didn't give it that much time, but it wasn't something I was interested in it like time bird. I

128
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,100
don't know about that, but yeah, it's it's very basic but

129
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,580
Act F says the sequel could be called Loki Lori

130
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,940
Get it. Yeah. All right, forget it

131
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,980
Well, how about something different sure different Virtual Console whoo at least in UK

132
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,300
um the games out and this time around are

133
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:05,100
We have hello Pokemon puzzle league. I'm sorry why to say hello. I'm reading for the thing. It says Pokemon puzzle league

134
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,860
has

135
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Come out

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
there's also a

137
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:20,460
A summer showdown which is makes me perfectly happy because it's Nina the actual neogeo versions for their neogeo

138
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,260
Virtual console stuff and actually it's going to be out for 900

139
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,460
We points which is a 630. Oh and before I forget to mention a Pokemon puzzle league is a

140
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,460
thousand points

141
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,540
Burning fight is also the other one that's going to

142
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:47,300
That's out for 800 points, which is sort of like a Streets of Rage type ball or brawler. So there you go

143
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,820
Cool I would download these games if I had room

144
00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,140
Yeah, that that does suck. I don't I don't like having to delete stuff to make room room sucks

145
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,700
There's a game coming out in the u.s. Actually that Japan's had for a while now

146
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,380
It's a game called tornado and a lot of you may not be familiar with this game

147
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,620
it's actually very similar to Katamari Damacy and

148
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,980
The game entails you playing a creature that basically becomes a tornado and you have to much like Katamari

149
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,460
Suck up smaller objects and make your tornado bigger, and then you can suck up larger objects and stuff like that

150
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,180
Tasmanian Devil

151
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,940
something like that and

152
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,260
We'll be coming out on the ds in the fall. I want to say

153
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,420
September I

154
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,540
thought

155
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,980
Thought I saw this in September. I could be wrong

156
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,820
But um yeah, it's kind of neat and kind of a little quirky game

157
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,500
They'll be coming out here a little bit later on so keep an eye out for that

158
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,180
Is this something you've actually played? I haven't played it, but I've just seen screenshots and video of it

159
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,900
Hmm could this be the next big thing. I don't think it's gonna be a big thing, but it's a quirky little game, though

160
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,700
Hmm, it'll be like worth checking out at least

161
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,220
All right, well we have another game coming out on the ds

162
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,620
And I don't know if I would necessarily call this a game

163
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,980
But you know Ubisoft had their big press thing this last week, and they announced some of this stuff

164
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,780
We talked about in part a but here's the other interesting thing

165
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:26,700
They're going to be making a ds game based on Alan Carr's novel the easy way to stop this game

166
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,940
Is to stop smoking and what the game will do this game is coming out in November

167
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,380
What you do you pick a coach?

168
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,220
I guess in this game, and you create a program based on your smoking habit

169
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,780
And basically what the easy way method does is that you educate smokers about how addiction happens?

170
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,060
Convince them that whatever type of you know great feelings you get from smoking

171
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,260
You get from I guess or you can curb that stuff

172
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,300
And you try to stop the emotional dependency, so it's kind of strange though

173
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:07,180
This is all coming out as a video game, so this is I don't know interesting not really strange for a movie soft

174
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,340
I I want to know though are the rabbits in this because you know you're funny. No. I need to stop smoking

175
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,380
Like yeah, I think it's interesting that the DS is branching out like this so to speak

176
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,540
I mean brain draining is kind of led to you know a lot of these outside-the-box type games

177
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,380
But I'm gonna tell you what I used to be a smoker, and I quit granted

178
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,340
I was not a very heavy smoker, but enough where I was addicted okay in my mind

179
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,500
I I don't know this might be a personal opinion

180
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,460
I'll probably hate mail over this, but the only way you can quit is to when you say I'm going to quit quit

181
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
And then do it cold turkey

182
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,440
But it's one of those things where when you say it mean it well

183
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,180
Here's what this, but I don't I didn't have that huge dependency either

184
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,660
You know so maybe that's how I was able to get away with what this game does though is when you have the urge to buy

185
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,460
Cigarettes it gives you different Ubisoft game options that you could purchase

186
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,220
So it's like instead of buying or instead of buying a pack of cigarettes. How about you buy quick yoga or?

187
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,900
Far cry or yeah far cry or how about purchase the my weight loss coach all comes with a pedometer

188
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,860
You know stuff like that. That's how this game is gonna work frisbee says can't wait till alcoholic hero comes out for the TS

189
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,660
What do you think dark soccer? Do you think this will be an effective game? I?

190
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,780
Think that any tool is effective if someone believes in it

191
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,180
it's a lot of it has to do with with willpower and

192
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,060
whatever

193
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:40,780
And I hate to use this term, but if the crutch works for you, then use it. I mean I

194
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,660
Don't know. I'm kind of iffy about it. Just anyone who says that

195
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,140
anything

196
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,140
is easy is

197
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,380
Usually trying to I mean they are trying to sell you something

198
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,380
It's they're trying to feed you crap when all you need to do is just

199
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,340
Its willpower, and I know not a lot of people have a lot of willpower

200
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,180
And I know that it is a physical addiction. It is a drug and people are addicted to it

201
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,620
However, it's one that withdrawing from will not kill you

202
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,500
You just have to write it out listen has anyone learned anything from Metal Gear

203
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,780
I mean seriously you can eat tree frogs

204
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,100
No, no look at what smoking a pack of cigarettes gives you more time to figure out boss

205
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,320
He has to fight. You know this crazy war you know fight giant mechs up

206
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,680
Do you really want to fight giant mechs? This is what have smokes in his stomach?

207
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,600
You know this is this is why you know I?

208
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,060
Don't know I have nothing, but really this game is stupid

209
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,140
And if you're suckered in the buying it then I'm sure Nintendo has a few other training programs that they can send your way

210
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,040
Including vision training. I'm sure they're going to have hearing training coming up soon poop training poop training

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,160
consumer horror training and how

212
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,420
No, and again. I'm going to stick by this

213
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,000
Any anything is possible if you're willing to work for it the end

214
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,080
Anything worth having is worth putting effort into right?

215
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,760
Yeah, it just depends on how much you want it

216
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,740
I might my whole thing is that if you really really really want to quit smoking if you really want to do it

217
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,360
You don't need a game

218
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,480
You'll just do it a game might help, but you don't need it. It's not like heroin. You know where you could you know I?

219
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:34,000
Guess have a bunch of complications from withdrawal, but if you need to buy a book to tell you how to quit something

220
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,840
That's retarded. I'm sorry it is retarded

221
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,240
Seriously, uh how do I quit something stop doing it?

222
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Do you really need to buy a book for that?

223
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
and

224
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,440
What I'm gonna say I'm gonna say this because I I will

225
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,560
Freely admit that there's lots of things that I have kind of poor willpower about you know

226
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,160
But I think that you know if you just sort of say you know nothing changes until you are ready to make it change

227
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,960
Until you are ready to make it change, and then do what you need to do to make it change, right?

228
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,200
So I think that you just have to want it bad enough to put the effort into it if you want it bad enough

229
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,920
You'll do it. That's that's what I think so

230
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,720
Alright, well, we'll see how this game does and what type of floodgates it'll open if it does really well in the meantime

231
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,760
Let's talk about some I have no pity for people who say I can't stop smoking and hold a cigarette in their hand yeah

232
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,760
So you can do it. I wish my mom would quit anyway um

233
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Guess what is coming out in Japan a bunch of stuff including the gardening game poop training

234
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,020
Poop training coming out in Japan. You know they actually have toilet training cartoons

235
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm sorry the toilet that sings to you. I'm sorry. I as poop that laughs as it exits the body

236
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,600
I'm really sorry. I asked they're funny though anyway um

237
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,560
They're getting a fatal frame for

238
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,560
If you like your gory ghost games, then that one is definitely going to be the one to go for but it's by Tecmo

239
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,040
Grasshopper manufacturer collaboration put putting this out together and fatal frame for it can be also called

240
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,080
Poltergeist snap poltergeist snap I like that that's a good name for that

241
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,920
I like that, but I'm basically you go around and shoot pictures of dead people the end

242
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,960
Did you character at any point go I see dead people I?

243
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Develop film of dead people

244
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
It's only porn if you tape it

245
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,760
They should have they should instead of fatal frame. They should have fatal cam

246
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,280
Were you um like videotape certain places and then have to run it through like a spectral analysis to have everything show up on film

247
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,640
I'm still waiting for what they play calm snap because that uh that that was the picture-taking game

248
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,720
I was looking forward to Rob what?

249
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,080
Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob whoa whoa whoa what okay? I?

250
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,960
Guess it's time for the next story. Yeah, I guess it is

251
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Well, we've been talking quite a bit about Ubisoft this show and we're going to continue talking about Ubisoft in fact

252
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,720
this was yet another game that was shown off at their

253
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Ubi days conference and

254
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:26,000
This game uses the we balance board, but not how you might think the game is raving Rabbids

255
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,440
TV party and

256
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You sit on the balance board and use your ass to play different minigames nice and Raymond's raving Rabbids

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,320
You know they're kind of a party game sort of situation there one of the games

258
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:51,520
They show that is actually sliding down a hill on looks like an upside-down moose and you are using your ass to you know

259
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,880
Balance yourself as you go down the hill. Oh kind of fun

260
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,080
Moose other options are going to have in the game two or other minigames

261
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:06,360
They're going to have a dancing minigame where you have to do different things different poses and stuff which will also use the balance board

262
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,240
So it looks kind of neat and of course the raving Rabbids are very funny. This needs to become a sitcom

263
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,920
The Rabbids just an ordinary life kind of like a garfield thing that'd be funny

264
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,040
Should do like Joe's apartment, but with yeah, yeah, I like we're going there. Yeah, exactly

265
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,320
So if it's like garfield will though will will there be a normal ah?

266
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,040
I want to know you know I had to go back and read that again Rob

267
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,560
What garfield minus garfield minus garfield is excellent?

268
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:43,640
I just and Dan and I had a discussion about this. We've decided that just looking at that either

269
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,840
John Arbuckle, you know the main guy right is either really really really sad or

270
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,880
Mad like Looney Tunes, maybe a little of both I?

271
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,360
Don't know

272
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,260
Well, you know what makes me really really sad and then really really mad is the fact that I can't find we fit anywhere

273
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,480
because the game sold out as fast as it came out and that is not yet back on shelves and

274
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,580
One of those crazy game industry analyst Michael patcher talked to the La times about the we fit supply

275
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,440
And how it's so short

276
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,400
Apparent but it's very interesting what he says is the reason for this it's because of the value of the dollar

277
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,280
Quote the shortage demonstrates one consequence of the weak dollar

278
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,640
We're seeing companies ignore their largest market simply because they can make greater profit elsewhere

279
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,520
They know that Americans will be just as fat a few months from now

280
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,900
Even though there has been about half a million copies of we fit shipped to the us there have already been about 2 million in

281
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,860
Europe kind of interesting those things are going on like really

282
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:57,140
Crazy prices on eBay like 180 dollars and stuff like that. That's dumb. It's just like we used when they first came out

283
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,140
exactly

284
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,800
Alpha canagram and chat says sky should have pre-ordered it. Here's the thing. I didn't know if the game would be any good

285
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,300
That's a lot of money to drop my game. You don't know that much about

286
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:13,560
Yeah, I know and then honestly though. I think they're given they kind of blame everything on the weak u.s. Dollar now

287
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,460
Oh, there's George must be the weak u.s. Dollar. I don't really think they put that much thought into it to be honest

288
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,940
I think it's just

289
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,860
They fucked up yet again

290
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,440
And so I mean because what would be the point of releasing like for example Mario Kart there was a shortage

291
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,660
The week it came out, and then there was a lot more later on next week

292
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,500
So you're telling me that the dollar turned around within that week

293
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I somehow doubt that much like I doubt that this that once these

294
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,960
Stores get replenished with more product that oh, it's because the dollar turned around no

295
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,100
I think it's just because they're a retard and poor planning. That's all it is

296
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,980
Akuma JP is one of our listeners in Japan and he says there's fit everywhere here now granted the game has been out a lot longer

297
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,420
There but what I thought was interesting that he said is a lot of used here, so I think it's not that good

298
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,020
So apparently a lot of them are being turned right around in Japan can ship one to me

299
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,540
I'll play it can we play it on the American wheeze though their region watch right I?

300
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,140
Think you can we can get the art didn't they figure that the it's just the weight limit

301
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,420
Let me look at it. Hi. I think they patched the freeloader

302
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,700
Yeah, the freeloader should work now actually remember that homebrew channel that we were talking about last week

303
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,060
they have the gecko freeloader that you can use on there, which is a

304
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,060
basically

305
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,980
Region free player for your Wii games nice and it's homebrew and free

306
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,940
Ssj100 Matt says I can't get my porn it must be the weak us dollar

307
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,860
I

308
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,700
Can't get his porn

309
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,620
You know they say that were the case then we wouldn't be able to buy any games because everyone would be selling them in different

310
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,360
Regions, that's just retarded. You know they say porn is a rescission proof. I don't know we'll see

311
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,380
Crunky boy jr. Says I'm sure Nintendo does this on purpose to create a day and do I mean serious?

312
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,020
This is retarded now. It's they want this to be the big Christmas item, and that's what they're gonna

313
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:13,340
Do they're gonna make this you know just like the Wii system, and it's gonna be a shortage for like a year and a half

314
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,260
You watch

315
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,940
All right, we'll see all right

316
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,500
Let's see what you the listener have to say you can always email us every week mailbag at orange launch rater calm

317
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,380
And every week dark Sakura picks out a few of her favorite emails and reads them to you in a little segment

318
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
We call the olr mailbag

319
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,420
It's a dark Sakura dive in to mailbag orange launch rater calm pull out a few of your favorites and read them

320
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,420
uh

321
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,940
None of them were my favorite so the end

322
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
nice try

323
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,700
Okay, this one comes from cheeseburger. I'm finally reading one of your emails, so leave me alone

324
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,100
Hey guys, I'm going to get an Xbox 360 pro soon, and I want some recommendations

325
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,700
Also, I got my first BSOD after playing six hours of Starcraft. I never found out what the problem was dude

326
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,380
You're playing six hours of Starcraft. Oh, we need the

327
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Starcrafts pretty awesome them or your computer's like stop playing Starcraft play something else

328
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,620
It's such a broad question though about the whole like you know Xbox 360 recommendations

329
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,460
What do you like you know it really depends tell us some games that you you do like and that'll be good

330
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,660
I guess otherwise games that everybody seems to like at least if you're listening to this show

331
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:34,500
I can kind of already tell you probably must like you know the RPG you're not as into like sports games

332
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,360
Let's say we don't talk a lot about those unless it's like tech mobile

333
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,140
But we talk a lot more about RPGs, so if you like RPGs

334
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,920
I think lost odyssey is the best one out there in the u.s.. Right now

335
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,020
I'm not sure rez HD says act F. Which is an awesome music game if you like music based games

336
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,540
That's definitely a good one

337
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
I think every extent extra extreme is pretty good

338
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,220
Definitely try to mix it up between the arcade titles and the other stuff because there's some great great titles on Xbox live arcade that

339
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,340
Are worth your time geometry wars is still some of the best $5.00. You'll ever spend Marvel ultimate alliance

340
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,660
But you I still get that on multiple systems, but yeah, yeah, but I still go back and play that all the time

341
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,900
What if you're a racing game fan? What's one of the better racing games on Xbox 360 you think I?

342
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,620
I I still like the last burnout game project

343
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,700
Yeah, it depends. Yeah, I guess a bit. Oh orange box suggests act F

344
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,660
Which is you know definitely portal and other great shooter games if you like first-person shooters

345
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,660
So there's Tiger Claw Samus is not in Marvel ultimate alliance. It's Iron Man

346
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,920
No, it's Samus is in Marvel ultimate or was gonna be a molar ultimate alliance

347
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,100
But got cut out wow for the Wii version that the lever and there has been

348
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,540
Someone found it in the PlayStation 2 version because you know the code that they just you know edit out or whatever

349
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,220
Comment out kind of interesting

350
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:05,580
This then oh my god. There's a video out there. It's on I think Kotaku ran it. I want to say maybe even joystick

351
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,300
Alright, so there you go. There's some suggestions if you want more

352
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,260
I guess tell us what kind of games you do like and that'll give us some places to start

353
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,900
Anyway next email can I read it can uh-huh of course okay?

354
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,980
this comes from

355
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
lichen

356
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:29,060
Hey, olr. Hi. Hey. I just thought that I would say hi and keep up the good work

357
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:34,180
I was just wondering if any of you have seen the video of using the Wii with well

358
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
And if not I'll send it to you

359
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,100
And he did send a link to it, but I'm not gonna watch it

360
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,020
It said he thinks it's clean like our comments

361
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,180
But why don't we why don't we watch it and comment back on it next week?

362
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,500
I guess so because I've heard of it, but I haven't really watched it so Jamie

363
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,640
It'll be your responsibility to make sure we watch it for next week

364
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,100
Okay, all right. Oh, I have hiccups now

365
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,700
Next email yes, ma'am. Hey, olr. Hey

366
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,020
I've been listening to your awesome show for some time now

367
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,980
And I was just wondering what kinds of places you get your news slash release date really

368
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,480
Release dates from if you can't read it on air. Don't feel like revealing them. It's no big deal. I was just curious

369
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,440
Thanks PS breadsticks are brought to you by this email home of the never-ending Olive Gardens by amplitude

370
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,700
Amplitude we between the three of us

371
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,060
We probably look at like a hundred different gaming news sites and blogs out there on the internet

372
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,020
And I'll tell you a little bit about how it works behind the scenes behind the scenes

373
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,020
We keep a little thread in a private forum that nobody but the hosts and some of the other

374
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:42,980
Olr people who've worked with us for many years can see and basically when stories are interesting we put them in this post and then

375
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
We you know every Sunday

376
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,500
We'll thread them together into what stories are going to cover on the show and usually with few exceptions

377
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,300
I usually thread them together into the big big thing

378
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,240
But I just try to pick I try to pick a flow like pick the we stories put them together the Xbox stories

379
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,220
And you know try to pick big things sometimes I miss things that's why we have last-minute stories and Loki always picks up the crap

380
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,740
That I drop under the table

381
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,380
I will say though where I get my release dates from since it's come up on the show as a question before is that I?

382
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,100
Do actually get my release dates from Eurogamer mm-hmm, which is just great overall

383
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,900
And I get my Japanese release dates from import game stores, so there you go although sometimes. I will use

384
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:28,220
Just on my own. I will actually use some of the video game retailers in the UK to verify a few dates

385
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,620
But now on the other hand Loki sometimes has insider info on the US release dates

386
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,580
Thanks to you know the stuff that he does so yeah, and then other times

387
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm just lazy and read it off a game stop

388
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,360
So there you go nice just depends or Kotaku or now that just wherever has you know whoever has it

389
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,060
I've even pulled crap off CNN and and sadly enough because I am in the game selling business a lot of this

390
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,420
I have on the top of my head too, so I could you know sometimes

391
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:58,820
I don't even need the release dates gs68 says what is olr a miserable little pile of secrets I?

392
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,040
Want to point out there's other people to contribute to the stories you hear on the show dark Tetsuya

393
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,180
Also posts in our thread and once in a while Travis Donovan and DMN put their head in there when they see something really interesting

394
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:18,600
So it's not just the three of us that contribute the stories, but just everywhere we have our eyes everywhere like the the

395
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,740
but what the

396
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,900
Terrorist story from the part a is actually um was a link given to me last night by my friend

397
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,040
Who's busy doing a programming test applying for a Namco?

398
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,460
And she's like I'm tired of doing this here look at these links are funny

399
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,100
You never know so I could I get them from people when I did the other week

400
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,980
I actually got from Rama so that was cool alright, so next email

401
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,780
Thank you amplitude, and it's amplitude with the why something amplitude

402
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,820
All right, this comes from Kevin

403
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,720
Tom hi Kevin dramatic music you guys um in the current show talked about Pinna Gogo

404
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,980
Which I've never heard of honestly have to keep that in mind. It's in Dixon, and it's really hot just word of warning

405
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,420
But are any of you going to attend California extreme? Oh hell? Yeah?

406
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,580
It's in San Jose, and you can read all the info at

407
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,100
www.ca expo.com or just California extreme into Google and Firefox URL bar blah blah blah

408
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:25,020
It'll be my first time going and it would be a kick to see what anyone else thinks of it from their first time

409
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,220
I'm keep up the good work and join the show

410
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,860
I hit the fair by accident and join this show as I'm typing from work ha Kevin

411
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,420
We won't tell your boss Kevin because I do this all the time, too

412
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,820
Um I have never been to California extreme, but I want to go this year

413
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,920
We ran and we actually ran into mela melody there last year

414
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,080
They had a hotel then they live and they live there. I think that's funny, but

415
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,600
Sometimes you want to get away last year in what where everyone knows your name um anyway um I?

416
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,480
Last year was my second California extreme, and it's just a freaking blast um

417
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,320
First of all it's air-conditioned which gives it major major points over Pinna Gogo right then and there um

418
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:12,480
um it's like you you go up to the desk you pay your money you walk in pinball oh

419
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,720
My God, it's not just pinball too. It's um

420
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,480
It's old classic games like they had the journey game there rob

421
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,960
That's why I'm fucking sold on this I played a full game of space Harrier

422
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,320
I beat space Harrier rob, but it's all in free play right when you get in oh, we're definitely going um

423
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Um definitely going they had um. Oh, God. What else was it they had um?

424
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,740
That game where you slide a pole back and forth and you're sort of like a tug-of-war game were you?

425
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,400
Oh, I thought it was an incredible maze or whatever that no no no no no

426
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,900
It's or you you you have to either run them into or push it from the other side

427
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,320
It's whoever stronger, but you win matches out of it, and I actually um I'd be who did I be I?

428
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,360
Remember who I beat I beat will that was who I beat so look there's your long answer to the short answer yes

429
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,180
We're going there's more we asked for opinions of whoever had their first time and they also

430
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,400
It is an ultra Kade sort of show-off tech place, so they do have ultra pin there

431
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,480
They did last year an ultra pin is a plasma TV the size of a pinball table with

432
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,080
LEDs and everything up in it emulates different tables

433
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,960
And they help like and it's just really cool

434
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,680
And they also have a room with machines for sale, so if you wanted to come a bit of you know a classic joy

435
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,000
You can have a machine for cheap. They had an Alpine racing. They're like who's gonna take that home

436
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
Sorry, no one has room for that

437
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,140
But um yeah, um and I'll tell you what if you want to meet up

438
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Because you know I'm definitely gonna go

439
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,240
Shoot another email, and we'll make arrangements for for meeting up. Do they do panels there or anything

440
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,560
I do believe they do panels maybe we ought to look into that all right

441
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,120
We'll have to see all right, but California extreme is just tons of fun tons of fun

442
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,520
Um oh god really long email

443
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,620
Long email is long well email is long, but but but but but but this is from Katamari's forever

444
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
So I'm gonna read it

445
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,920
What?

446
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,700
Sorry he's watching that movie while you're reading emails. I know watching something else all right. What is it now?

447
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,600
You gotta tell it porn it's a cat battle, but it's a battle

448
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,720
But that is controlled by a cat and it rides in it and that is the coolest thing ever

449
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,340
Oh my god. I post the link already in chat. Oh my god. Okay. Can I read this okay?

450
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,000
Good evening, olr. I trust you have had a pleasant weekend so far

451
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,160
Anyway, since I didn't write a letter for the past couple of weeks

452
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:49,640
I wanted to put out it put out a few things out of the open with the school year ending in a couple weeks for

453
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Me and the raging sense of boredom. I feel I'm going to get I decided to stock up on summer games exclamation point

454
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,240
Since the titles coming out in the June July August months are slim pickings

455
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,200
I got more than enough games to hold me over from the a-list Wii titles to lost via Domus

456
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,320
While I live close to the border close to the border to Canada

457
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,640
I frequently shop there and Canadian EV games already has a game days sale out late June

458
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,720
I can't wait for the summer sales here, and I hope I can find a copy of rez ps2 version. I don't have a 360 or

459
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,760
Or excuse me guitar a man for dirt cheap

460
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,480
anything you're looking

461
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,980
Looking forward to playing other than while Ragnarok and GTA 4

462
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,040
I

463
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Want the world ends with you

464
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,420
And I want the Iron Man game. I'm being denied

465
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Guys

466
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,640
Game as we want. Yeah, you're looking forward to playing in the summer

467
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I

468
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Don't know I

469
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
Have to be honest sir not a lot. I can think of right now

470
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,160
We fit whenever I can get my hands on it. I think it'll be fun to play

471
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,180
Especially at the little demo. I had the other week, but as far as like games

472
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,280
I'm really looking forward to I can't think we're gonna live in your underwear, huh?

473
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,160
Can hula hoop in your underwear? I just might we should get you some underoos

474
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,240
No, thank you to contain that you looking for anything

475
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,400
I

476
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
was looking forward to Saints Row 2

477
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,100
but I can't now because

478
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:26,660
Later news Final Fantasy for DS if that ever comes out. I don't think that's coming out. It is summer. Is it a summer?

479
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,540
Yeah, it's July and the civilization game. So there you go. Okay, I'm looking forward to I

480
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,300
Thought I might be looking for grid. I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick that up. I think the next game I have an order is

481
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,900
Shit it was good to her here on DS, but I don't think I want that anymore. I

482
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,620
I don't know. I may just get like one of those DS

483
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:56,700
R4s or r6 is or wherever they are now and just homebrew. I might buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith for laughs

484
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,040
Well, I'm going to continue because I don't know please do

485
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,540
What I'm still waiting on. Oh, no, what I'm still waiting for is my Okami covers. Me too. Hi

486
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,820
I ordered one the week of when you said how to get one and I'm still waiting for it a month after

487
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,260
Have you gotten your cover yet? No does and does it look cool probably

488
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:24,980
I'll find out it looks cool on the website and well after reading some rave reviews and some really odd statistics

489
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,060
I picked up a copy of Grand Theft childhood from my local library

490
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,120
Well, I haven't read a whole lot of it finals week soon have to cram

491
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
I have to say I'm quite impressed

492
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:40,040
They somehow debunk all of the gaming myths such as violence and sex and shed some light on the hot topics

493
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,660
Like what girls actually play and how violent video games reduce stress?

494
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,080
I can't wait to finish it as well as my newly acquired copy of Katamari Damacy. I

495
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,740
have to say I was I

496
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,480
Was a little five-year-old boy again after hearing the news about DDRX and DDR hottest party to last week

497
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:03,500
Well, I know most of the world has moved on with other lavish music games

498
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,220
I'm still anticipating the release of one of the best franchises Japan has ever given birth to I

499
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:15,560
Must be the only one in Michigan who cares about this now and speaking of Konami. Are they what Rob you're grabbing the mic?

500
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,220
No, no, is it for support? Yeah, just getting ready in case I think of a witty comment

501
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,740
Okay, speaking of Konami. Are they really serious in releasing rock revolution in its current form?

502
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,420
I mean they should just change the engine to unreal 3-1 and put arrows instead of colored cues

503
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,780
But really Konami and Konami and Bemani should just release a guitar

504
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:42,420
Slash drum freakish type game and ditch the rock and roll is in vibe that just makes them sing like copycats of their own concept

505
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,840
hopefully the DLC and hottest party 2 will be one unlockable key that unlocks everything and

506
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,320
More for just 200 points or less we could hope but will they probably not three more things?

507
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,740
Thank you for giving us a countdown. How's dr. Mario online? Can you really send we friends a demo?

508
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,660
From what I understand. Yes, and somebody has sent me a demo, but I haven't bought the game myself yet

509
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,020
And we don't get copies because we're not special. So we have to buy them just like you

510
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,860
Rob are you going to penny arcade Expo?

511
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,220
That's the plan. I will know for sure in a couple weeks, but I am planning on going and ferret

512
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,420
Are you really going to be in a horror movie as the slasher that kills everyone?

513
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,620
I think we should let the ferret answer that don't you think I?

514
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:34,580
I don't think you should give them. Oh you shouldn't give so much plot details away ferrets. You know what ferret?

515
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,060
Okay, that's good enough, baby. I like the other one that made the different noises. I know the wolfie looking one. Yeah

516
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,420
Okay, I

517
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,540
Regret that this letter is very super long

518
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,420
I it's just that I had to say was on my mind

519
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,180
And I really didn't have the time until now until then your favorite email or freeway shuffle into the next DVR iteration

520
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Cottamari is forever PS

521
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:03,340
This message should be brought to you by the Olive Garden, but instead it's currently asking permission to be endorsed by Bobby black wolf

522
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,580
although as

523
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
Cottamari's forever wrote booby

524
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:16,980
That's time. Maybe that's his cousin. It's a typo all right two more emails. They're little all right. Are they short. Yes, haven't j-rod

525
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Hi guys

526
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,620
Just a quick hi j-rod just a quick comment. I was just listening to episode 279 at work the other day

527
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:32,820
When Loki started his rant about we fit and how Nintendo is just trying to find any market of soccer moms and people who watch

528
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,340
Oprah by the end of his rant I found myself almost clapping with my headphones on again

529
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:42,860
Loki echoes my thoughts around the world this email sponsored by the Olive Garden home of never-ending salads and breadsticks

530
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,380
Don't encourage him

531
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,420
I didn't say anything about it. Mommy heart

532
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,260
You know he likes it anyway

533
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,220
I was just wondering if you were going to do a show on a

534
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,740
Saturday on a long weekend like you talked about a while back

535
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,060
Oh, well our goes past midnight where I live and I have to get up at 5 in the morning

536
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,460
The show is comedy gold and I will listen until it is long dead like DTR

537
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,040
Thanks for putting on such a good show week after week, and that's BHK 667

538
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,660
I don't know so much about Saturday, but we did talk about doing a show like around noontime

539
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,940
So we should still make sure that happens at some point

540
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:25,740
Sometime over the summer you know what we should do although. It would probably kill us what do an all-night marathon

541
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
No way my die

542
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,580
I remember what happened when I did a marathon show at you know the tournament we had at scandia

543
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,420
That wasn't fun

544
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,540
Do you run out of things to talk about and it's just now if we if we found something though to keep things interesting like maybe

545
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:46,300
Rotating out old video classic video games for a night or something there there, or we did it for charity or something

546
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,300
There might be a reason to do it. I don't know maybe Labor Day weekend, but don't hold your breath

547
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
Alright, so that's it for emails

548
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,360
Yeah, if you would like to contribute mailbag at orange launch rated comm is the place to go for now more gaming news

549
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,340
So as I kind of hinted what we were talking about games for the summer

550
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,860
Sorry hold on black wolf reminded me Labor Day weekend is the same as packs for some reason

551
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,700
I thought it was a weekend before so what's the next three-day weekend after Labor Day weekend? Maybe Thanksgiving?

552
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:23,440
That's not a three-day weekend rob four-day weekend. No, it's not support a pre weekend. No, it's not whatever I

553
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,940
Probably won't be here. How about I?

554
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,860
Don't know let's make up our holiday

555
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,660
Seriously, we'll figure something out. We'll make up a holiday olr day. That's it

556
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,440
We have olr day, and we can all take off from work. We'll see we'll see

557
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,820
Anyways say zero two has been delayed to October 14th and

558
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,880
You know because I would imagine that grand theft auto 4 is so awesome

559
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,020
so you know they have to spend the extra time making sure that say zero two doesn't suck and

560
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:04,780
Apparently they're saying you know of course marketing issues and product quality is the reasons for the oh?

561
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,060
Product quality well, it's just making sure that the game's not so glitchy. You know after all we don't want another musical

562
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,220
Detailing the glitches in the game. Well. I do, but you know no one else does

563
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,380
I don't know

564
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,380
I think it's kind of cool though that they're putting it out so late because I guess me enough time to be done with

565
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,820
Grand theft auto 4 not that I'll ever be done with grand theft auto 4

566
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,520
But you know to the point where I can play another game

567
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,700
All right, in fact. That's what I'm going to do this summer's play games

568
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,460
I already have well while you're waiting for a new game such as Saints Row 2 to come out

569
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,140
There's always Xbox live arcades weekly releases to keep you company and this week

570
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,100
There are two releases and none of them is a rehashed arcade title. That's pretty exciting

571
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,740
Roo goo is one of the titles coming out. It sounds like ragu the pasta sauce

572
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:01,980
This is just me, but Roo goo is coming out from South Peak, and it's a puzzle game coming out for 800 Microsoft points

573
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,180
That's $10 and apparently it's a four-player game

574
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:12,340
It doesn't have to be what you do you slide pegs of different shapes into appropriate holes while you're trying to save an alien race

575
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,780
So it sounds like the game perfection

576
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,660
Put a little different that sounds bizarro could be interesting the screenshots definitely look bizarro

577
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,100
They have a very katamari ish vibe to them, but thankfully all Xbox live arcade games come with a demo

578
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,460
So we'll be able to find out and if that's not your cup of tea

579
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,260
Maybe aces of the galaxy will be that is the other game that's going to be coming out unfortunately

580
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,340
We don't know a lot about it. We know it has co-op play and

581
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,900
It's also an 800 point price tag, and it's coming out from our tech and we have a screenshot

582
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,540
So it looks like a space game hence Galaxy, but that's about it

583
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,340
So you'll have to check that out when the demo comes out

584
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:58,380
But if you've been for whatever reason secretly following aces the galaxy no more information. We do well, then the payoff is this week

585
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,060
There you have it

586
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,060
Hey, y'all hey

587
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,820
Hmm hey hey listen what?

588
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,180
Galaga yes

589
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,660
um there is a listing up for a

590
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,860
Galaga legions for Xbox 360

591
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,580
It's actually put up by the usk which is the German version of the ESRB

592
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:32,260
And I would so try to pronounce it if I didn't suck completely a German so whatever although actually that did remind me something funny

593
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,260
I found in GTA 4 by the way

594
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,460
But I'll talk about that later

595
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,340
All righty

596
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,260
Okay, they have they have a billboard for something called pass what?

597
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,260
pass was sir piss water, so anyway

598
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,780
That's funny, okay

599
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,900
So um so basically it's it's a shooter. That's about

600
00:45:53,620 --> 00:46:00,980
All we know so but it's Galaga and they're not sprightly. You know in pixely so

601
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:09,540
Okay, you know what though the weird thing about this is that it makes me think maybe it's an upgrade thing like pac-man vs.

602
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,340
Was or not?

603
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,220
Versus pac-man of wealth I mean that was an upgrade, but you know I'm thinking a pac-man championship edition

604
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,740
Kind of like that although pac-man championship edition is pretty awesome

605
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,340
So they are making a game like that, but out of Galaga that could be kind of cool because I actually like Galaga

606
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,980
So I don't know I like Galaga a whole lot

607
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:35,140
I actually have a little um charm thing. That's the the ship somewhere

608
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,140
Hmm, I don't know if I care for Galaga that much but

609
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,540
but one game that people seem to care about quite a bit was penny arcade and

610
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:55,020
The penny arcade game actually penny arcade adventures was the highest grossing Xbox Live arcade debut ever

611
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,580
earning

612
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:05,660
$20,000 in its first three days, and that's according to of course VG charts the prior record holder was worms HD and

613
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:14,780
I guess in term of units sold on the rain slick precipice of darkness was the third highest performer of 2008

614
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,380
So that's pretty cool, huh?

615
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,860
Well that good for them

616
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,420
I still have not bought the game, but I think I'm going to because I had a lot of fun with the demo

617
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,620
So we'll see but the penny arcade game good for them

618
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,860
It's a funny game. I know that

619
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,540
Well, I know Loki's going to be very excited about this and this could break records of a different kind

620
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,020
It's not an Xbox live, but virtual console

621
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,540
There's a game. I know that Loki has been begging and pleading for on virtual console for the longest time

622
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:50,800
Guess what Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars is apparently making its way to

623
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,780
Japan

624
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,140
It's going to be in June. It's made its way to the June release calendar and

625
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:03,840
You know the games that tend to show up in the Japanese calendar usually end up over here eventually

626
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,100
So there you go one thing though

627
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,620
Nintendo has made the game cost an extra 100 we points just because they know this game will be better so

628
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:20,240
900 we points for this game there you have it by the way some other games that show up on the Japan's June release list

629
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,480
For the NES Yoshi's cookie, which we already have here

630
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,120
Nekketsu Coco dodgeball boo

631
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:34,320
For the Sega Master System Rambo for the Genesis Phantasy Star 4 for PC engine which over here was

632
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,920
TurboGrafx-16 power tennis days of Thunder paranoia and blazing lasers and for the neo-geo

633
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,760
Lasers for the neo-geo king of monsters ninja commando and art of fighting too

634
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,360
So do you know the art of fighting?

635
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,440
I

636
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,560
Know there's a character named after me in art of fighting

637
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:58,000
No, I am I spent like about 30 minutes today reading the Wikipedia article about Dan and in

638
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,640
From the Street Fighter alpha series and how he was a big parody of Rio and

639
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,280
Robert Garcia

640
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,680
Hmm with Yuri's taunts

641
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,080
So interesting, but I know I don't know are you excited about Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console?

642
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,080
Loki or I am pretty excited about it

643
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,200
Just have to wait for it to come out over here. Yeah, we'll be waiting Nintendo. We're sitting here waiting

644
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,640
I'm not

645
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:35,960
Fine, then why don't you read a story or something? I think I will then guess what else is going to be on the Wii

646
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,720
Beer pong game no you have to guess though cuz I'm not gonna read the story well. I know the answer tech mobile

647
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Oh done the done um not the Virtual Console releases

648
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,560
We've already got but we'll have tech mobile kick off

649
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,320
Which is a new football game that is going to be on the Wii, so it's um

650
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,280
going to be on the Wii and we'll probably use a wiimote and

651
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:08,840
It's football that's about all that we've got details on but I'm I'm sort of agreeing with this article that it's it's

652
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,040
Has the stench of we wear about it

653
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,200
Will it have the awesome halftime cutscenes that the NES version had?

654
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,200
That's what I'm hoping for I believe in the it's going to be on Wii and be about football should cover about everything

655
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
I know about that game

656
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,040
fine

657
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,640
Be that way see if I care. I will hey our skype line is going to be open very soon

658
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,860
1 8 7 7 game Olr if you want to get in on the fun

659
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:40,540
We have a couple more stories to read for you first loki. I was going to say also one thing to

660
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,220
Going back to the tech mobile that is interesting this here

661
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:51,820
You can customize your team's everything down to the logos to the player stats names, Etc

662
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,220
That's how they're getting around not having license

663
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,140
Because you can make your own team, ha ha nice smart

664
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,860
anyways

665
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,860
something else that's coming to

666
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,760
Consoles well not anytime soon, but eventually

667
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,340
Street fighter 4 and one of the cool things about Street fighter 4 is other than online play

668
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,300
You'll be getting some new characters from the arcade

669
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,460
And two of the characters that they showed concept art for

670
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,980
Faye long and Dan

671
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,700
so that's pretty cool and

672
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,100
uh there's also supposedly more characters Beyond just those two, but

673
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,180
to the start

674
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:42,860
It's kind of interesting to see that they're adding characters from you know Street fighter turbo and stuff like that plus

675
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,540
It's Dan, and I'm sure that makes Jamie kind of happy

676
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,020
Yeah

677
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:51,860
this is he cracks me up because I love that his one of his attacks is it translates to

678
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,420
taunting legend and

679
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,420
Shiny fist I love all of his attacks. They're just hilarious

680
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,380
I actually kind of like playing as Faye long and the street fighter super game, so

681
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,580
I'm excited to hear he's in the street fighter for

682
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,260
Sound he always made that's pretty cool

683
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,620
There you go

684
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,740
All right, we'll be checking that out when the street fighter 4 comes out here in America

685
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,600
Hopefully sooner rather than later. We'll see anyhow

686
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:27,760
Steam I talked about steam earlier when I was talking about audio surf which I was reviewing earlier in the show

687
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,880
Valve has announced that there will be a new edition coming to steam. It's steam cloud

688
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,040
It's the services announced this past week what it's going to do

689
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:42,280
It's going to store your steam player data online and the cool thing about that is that you can access your save games

690
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,080
Keyboard configurations all the games that you purchase through steam from any computer anywhere

691
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,840
So that was something that was announced for earlier this week

692
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,140
Valve is very committed to PC gaming and saying the PC retail is not doomed

693
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:04,560
Even though they sometimes have these free weekend games on steam it just in turn supports stronger sales at retail

694
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,560
You know some people just don't want to buy their games online

695
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:13,520
So we'll have to see how this turns out. It sounds pretty cool in theory doesn't it yeah, so we'll see how that works

696
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,520
Yeah, in theory you never know how that's going to work all right the skype line is now open

697
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,760
1877 game, Olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio

698
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,040
And we're going to go to the skype line right now and take a call hi you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

699
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,400
Hey, all right. It's G68 hi. Hello. Huzzah. What's on your mind, buddy?

700
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,440
Um so california extreme I might I think I'll go check it out

701
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,600
Cool, then we'll see you there, and hopefully we'll be able to do something there although

702
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,760
I don't know if it's last minute or what but we'll do an Olr lunch or something if nothing else

703
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,360
So if I decide to go that

704
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,920
That might throw me what little chance I have to go to comic-con this year. Oh

705
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,920
Decisions decisions comic-con I hear is pretty awesome. I've never been myself, but I mainly go to comic-con mainly because my

706
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:07,480
My friends from this cosplay group. I was at with Phantom at Phantom made this year gonna be there

707
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,480
This year gonna be there

708
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,480
Here's the thing if we go to california extreme. We're probably only gonna go for the day

709
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,880
I don't know about jamie, but I see it as more of a day trip than a weekend trip personally

710
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,240
I don't think it's something I want to stay the night for i'm actually gonna go for both days. Wow

711
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,320
She's dedicated

712
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:30,680
So mainly because i'm in the area. Well, santa clara specifically, right? Oh, gosh, it's right in your backyard. Why not? You should go

713
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,160
pretty much

714
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,600
It's like six miles from my house. Oh, well, then you got nothing another word speaking of santa clara

715
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,920
You said you live in santa clara?

716
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,200
Yep, I uh, I might be going to santa clara around the time of my birthday

717
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,960
I'm thinking of taking the day off work to go with uh, my uh boyfriend so we can go ride some rides. So it'd be fun

718
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,080
I've been there

719
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:00,120
Once this year and I didn't pick up a season pass. Unfortunately, didn't they have a new ride there this year?

720
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,400
Like um firefall, is that new this year? Yeah, I think so

721
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Looks interesting. All right

722
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,840
Anyhow, anything sorry, we're gonna we're gonna announce we got from food chat to amusement park chat

723
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,400
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight? Yeah

724
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,760
What critical thing out of my final report last week swap meet?

725
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
Oh, how was the swap meet at fonome?

726
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,080
best deals ever

727
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,440
How so?

728
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,480
like

729
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,560
If you go to kenya for example and buy european CDs like 40 dollars like

730
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,560
This guy over the swap me was selling those for only ten dollars each

731
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,480
nice

732
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,920
Now to get some other games are cheap. I'm contra for for 18 and amplitude for three dollars

733
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,680
I like bargains. That's one thing I missed about going down. Uh, not i'm almost called it out of my expo

734
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,840
one thing I missed about going to fonome this year was uh getting to go to the dealer's room and the

735
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,920
swap me and all that good stuff and trying to uh

736
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,480
Uh, get some good deals on shirts and stuffed animals and other chibi things

737
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,080
uh, I did something cool happen when I was like getting contra for I had a 100 bill and

738
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,440
I offered to get only 80 and change back and to make it for a different to throw in

739
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,680
an ultra mix 3 slash extreme 2 sample cd

740
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,760
Oh, hey

741
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,640
well

742
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,760
Little deals are pretty awesome sometimes so cool. Cool

743
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,040
Yeah, so anyone listening if you go to anime game adventures and don't go to swap meets you're missing out

744
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,080
The swap meets are great. I've looked into lots of good stuff at swap meets

745
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,080
awesome

746
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,480
All right. Well gs60. We gotta let you go take some more calls

748
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,440

00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,920
If you want to give us a call 1 877 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio

750
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

751
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,960
Hey, what's up, guys? It's toshin. Hello toshin. What's on your mind my friend. Uh, not much

752
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,920
Uh, I wanted to know rob if you've got picked up super budge dodgeball for the ds this week

753
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,480
No, I forgot it came out. Did you get it?

754
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,520
Yeah, I actually uh, I played my friend's copy loaned it to me. It's pretty fun. Oh my god

755
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,480
Tell us about this game. Is it is it faithful to the original or what?

756
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,640
I would say it's pretty faithful. Um, I only got to play like a multiplayer brawl, but I mean you can

757
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:19,800
Apparently level up like your players and there's like 14 or 15 different like teams you can pick

758
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,360
And like your super shots are apparently picked on your birth date that you enter in the q the whenever they ask you for it

759
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,600
Huh? That's kind of interesting

760
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,200
yeah, so I don't know all the combinations of like the super shots, but

761
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,880
Oh

762
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,280
My friends is pretty cool. It's kind of like the one where

763
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,880
You know when you run and it was like one of the slider ones like it was back and forth like a vertical ball, right?

764
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,080
He he had that one set up which was kind of cool. Huh? I didn't

765
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,320
But eight man brawl. Oh, that's really fun. Oh my gosh, this game sounds pretty awesome already

766
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,320
Can you play it over wife? Uh, can you play over internet wi-fi or is it just local wi-fi?

767
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:02,120
It's it's it's just a single card multiplayer on full trip. Fortunately, it's that's the only downfall I was like this has to have wi-fi

768
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:07,400
No, at least it's got the single or you only have to have one card to play multiplayer. That's kind of nice, I guess

769
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:14,200
Yeah, it's awesome. So cool. Well, I think for the reminder they came out. I gotta go get it. Oh, you have to get it. Hmm

770
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,360
All right

771
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:20,040
Very cool. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight? Any other games you've been playing or what have you?

772
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,920
Uh, I haven't been playing a lot because i've been working a lot, but you know

773
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,880
I I probably won't make use of the six or eight hundred microsoft points. You're going to give me this

774
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,880
Yeah, finally I finally got that over to you. So uh, definitely check that out

775
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,920
Well, you're supposed to be getting rez hd with it. That was the deal. So, uh, that's the

776
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,920
So, oh no i'll make use of the points I will definitely make up use of the points and

777
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,120
You know, we have to play like rock paint or something soon or something. All right

778
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:53,400
Well, I want full reviews on whatever you get later on. Okay, you got it. All right, take care tosha and have a good one

779
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:54,920
Thanks

780
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,480
Thank you. Thanks for the reminder about that ds

781
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,720
Super dodgeball ds. I had no idea what's coming out. Hey, the phone's ringing off the hook tonight

782
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,280
We're already into another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

783
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,680
Yo, this jammer jay. Hello jammer jay. What's on your mind? I don't believe i've heard you call before have you called before?

784
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,160
Um, I haven't called before. Oh, well then hello first time caller. What's on your mind?

785
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,800
Nothing. That was one. Um, hold on a second. I'm getting a little lag. That's all right. It happens

786
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,800
You got to shut down the porn torrents when you're listening. No, i'm just kidding. Yeah, okay

787
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,560
I was curious on um, oh, I don't usually have those running about now. I was curious. What uh, um,

788
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,120
What is the farthest you guys have ever traveled just to play?

789
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,760
Ddr like a road trip just to solely played an arcade version of ddr

790
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,520
Oh good question farthest we've ever traveled to solely play an arcade version of ddr

791
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,960
Loki do you have any uh answer for this? Well, it's pretty much just like three hours

792
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:52,200
I think we've been driving drove from here to like san jose or milpitas to play like some japanese

793
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,040
stuff there. I remember also we drove to stockton golf land to play, uh

794
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,160
Extreme I was max 2 when it first came out. Yeah max 2 when it first came out. They only had a stockton golf land

795
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,920
Uh, well, here's the thing do like tournaments count because we drove all the way to san diego once to go to a tournament

796
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,240
At rays and san diego is like a 10-hour drive from here

797
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:15,640
So that was pretty that's like one of the farthest I can think of or if you guys drove to like, uh, was it um,

798
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,000
The japanese arcades arcade infinity. I was thinking I don't I didn't drive all this way to play ddr

799
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,120
But I have driven that whole way to play beatmania 2dx would be

800
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,600
Arcade infinity, which is in la which is about uh, six and a half hour drive from here

801
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,600
So, how about you? How much the furthest you've ever driven think about six hours, but sometimes when I um

802
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,080
Go on trips. I make it a highlight to hit up any ddr in the area. So I think

803
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,720
Maybe like 10 hours

804
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,520
See that would that's kind of similar to something that's being mentioned in chat right now is this is j100

805
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,360
Matt is saying rob did go to new jersey to go to a ddr tournament and that's true

806
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:57,560
I happened to be in um allentown pennsylvania the exact same weekend that a ddr tournament was going on at eight in the break

807
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,160
Or was it in the groove? I think it was both

808
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,240
Um, and so I actually drove over to eight on the break in new jersey

809
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,480
Which is about a 90-minute drive just check out this tournament and see what the east coast scene was like because you know

810
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,000
There's a whole that east coast versus west coast

811
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,920
Although I didn't know anybody I really felt kind of like a fish out of water just because I was like a stranger and I

812
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,000
Wasn't really participating or anything and nobody really knew me over there. So I was like, oh my god

813
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,680
He really knew me over there. So it was um, you know, but I had a good time. It doesn't mean I didn't have a good time

814
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,080
What's that i've been to a ddr tournament in beluxy when I went back to visit

815
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,840
I know I know you were out for a moment when the caller first called in but he was wondering what's the furthest you've ever

816
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,960
Gone just to play ddr just to play ddr. Yeah

817
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:44,520
And I was I was saying okay beatmania 2dx at least there's been arcade infinity, but that's close actually

818
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,080
I went to san diego

819
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,360
to um

820
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:54,600
Well, I was going to san diego anyway, but one of the things I intended on doing was playing. Um

821
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,640
The uh, ddr max when it was new

822
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,280
That's right because rays was like the first place anywhere that had that huh and I went and played it

823
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,480
And that's when I realized that doing um that the hold arrows hurt really bad

824
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,760
Because i've got a little bit of a weakness in my ankles. So

825
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:16,200
But um other than that though the farthest distance i've traveled and then played ddr

826
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,520
Was um going back to alabama

827
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,000
From here. Okay, that's that's cool. Was that um, beluxy tournament at boomtown?

828
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,120
I do believe it was it was a few years ago. It was, you know, definitely before katrina

829
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,720
Um, and it was when we had a max they were just getting a fifth mix

830
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,200
Okay, yeah, I think I remember that because my buddy was working at that arcade there in boomtown

831
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,560
Wow, it wasn't boomtown now that I think about it because it was that the arcade was sort of off to the side

832
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:50,120
If I remember correctly and and it was a shiny brand new machine and I got up there and I think I played um

833
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,120
Why didn't I play superstar?

834
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,160
Because that was no it wasn't that it was when I was I had this thing about doing um

835
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,880
What was it that I used to always play? Um in hidden?

836
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:07,480
I don't remember I used to play I would only play the song hidden. Anyway, I don't remember but that's how how long ago that was

837
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:12,440
But yeah, it's a small world me and dark sakura are from the same part of the u.s

838
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,000
Oh, yeah, there you go. Next next time I next time I go hit up the home front, you know

839
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,200
Ddr. Well, not i'm not down there though. I'm in idaho. Oh, i'm sorry

840
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:29,000
Hey, but there's a um within two hours is supernova 2 arcade. So that's not too bad. That's sweet. That's cool

841
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:33,640
Yeah, apparently there's a supernova 2 in roseville, but i've yet to play it. You know, i'm just I I

842
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,000
I love being from the south, but I don't miss living there

843
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,480
It's a place you want to visit once in a while I don't ever go visit in the summer ever I made that

844
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,900
Yeah, I like it in the summer down there humidity

845
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,320
Really quick question for you jammer jay, and then we're gonna let you go

846
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:57,400
But um, do you think that the ddr home versions have kind of killed that whole desire to drive out and uh, go play other types

847
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,760
of ddr

848
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,200
I don't know the um reason i'll play the home versions that much as I don't up here

849
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,720
I don't have a good since I live in an apartment complex. I can't use my cobalt flux

850
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,480
It depends on what you play at at home on the actual platforms

851
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,720
I had that problem when I lived with extra furs that we lived upstairs and when I played ddr

852
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,440
It wasn't fun for the downstairs people so I couldn't do that

853
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,840
so

854
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,680
Yeah, but other than that like some people in the home version they have just as much fun on it

855
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,280
But I would need to really play in the arcade because I hit pretty hard on the pads, huh?

856
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,040
All right. All right. Well jammer jay, we gotta let you go to get some more calls

857
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,800
So thanks for the call and uh, I hope you call in again sometime. We like cool. Thanks

858
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Peace out and triple a peace out

859
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,520
Peace out. All right

860
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:44,360
What was the other thing you said in triple a oh like car insurance? Yeah, I guess so or maybe you know high score

861
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,760
ddr triple a

862
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,800
Where you make the machine go oh

863
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,080
One more call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

864
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,360
Hey, hey, hey, it's ronma. God. You always get through you got the miracle dialing finger. That's all right

865
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,360
We like you at least what's on your mind?

866
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:08,200
Not too much. I'm recovering from wizard world philly which was this weekend from what wizard world wizard. Oh, really? How is that?

867
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,400
Want me to be honest, yes, of course it sucked why did suck

868
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,000
As much as they really said this would be a big comic book convention

869
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,600
I could tell you look like no more than ten thousand people showed up at least it was just quiet

870
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,680
You know, it was just like bleh, you know, I don't know ten thousand sounds like a lot to me

871
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,680
I mean, it's no comic-con but still

872
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,600
Plus, um, the tournaments were kind of crappy too. That's too bad

873
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:47,320
So what is it really pissed me up is the fact that somebody was there selling roms and emulate emulators and roms for

874
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,800
Between 30 and 50 bucks. Oh

875
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,160
That's that you can get really busted for that. I mean, it's kind of illegal to begin with but when you're selling it for profit

876
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,840
That's when they really go all out of the way to get you. You gotta be careful

877
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,120
Turn them in the funny thing is with hmm. I said turn them in

878
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,560
Well, there's already someone going around doing that but at the comic conventions

879
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:13,480
They really bust you more for selling bootleg tv shows and movies and stuff like that. It's really sad when you see

880
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,120
like your favorite tv show

881
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:22,280
At the con for sale the entire first season for like 40 bucks where you can go to best buy and get it with a better

882
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,600
Quality, um cover for like 20

883
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,720
hmm

884
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,720
All right, well interesting, um, would you tell me a little more about this con

885
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,640
It was comics and games and like anime and like all that all rolled into one

886
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:44,440
Something like there's more comic books than they add in a touch of science fiction and anime. Um, kind of like

887
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,680
Because that's what comic-con does. I mean comic-con is supposed to be about comic books

888
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:54,280
But hello, like, you know, the battle star galactica people show up every year and so, you know turn into this big big thing. So

889
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,760
Well, even with starbuck being there still wasn't all that big big big thing. Ah, too bad starbuck was there

890
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,680
Yeah, my roommate was online for two hours to get her autograph. Nice

891
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,400
Good times. I've actually I finally been catching up on battle star galactica. I'm in the third season right now. So good times

892
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,160
I'm yeah overall. I don't think we're going back next year. Oh, that's too bad. Well, there you go

893
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,280
Oh

894
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,520

Okay, we pull a couch out in front of the street and burn shit

922
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:33,240
That's the best and then at the end they burn the couch fire rockets have broken toilets, okay

923
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,720
I don't know where they find every they find a toilet they get the fire the firecrackers. They just start launching them out of there

924
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:45,240
I'm like where the hell do you find this? You don't know black wolf and chat sums it up purpose or perfectly

928
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,680
Maybe we'll have to do some type of video thing for the fourth of july and uh the cast of olr setting things on fire

929
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,440
I videotaped last year's. Oh good, but I have but I had a migraine too

01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:24,040

932
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,200
Yeah, I was uh, it was bad. Anyway, let's not talk about my my crappy life

933
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,200
Let's talk about last minute stories loki. Do you have anything tonight for us? Yeah

934
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,080
um nintendo actually had

935
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,520
released some dates for japanese game releases and there's some new games on there that

936
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,440
A lot of people might not know about including well this one they showed off before mario's super sluggers for the wii

937
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:52,600
Which is coming out june 19th there then they've got band brothers dx, which is coming out on the ds

938
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,480
That's june 26. Then july 10th is resident evil zero

939
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,920
From capcom july 24th is wario land shake on the wii

940
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,560
which is going to be kind of like a

941
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,280
Super paper mario type game all sides scrolling but um using we

942
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,520
Motion controls and stuff like that. All right about that sounds kind of interesting

943
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,200
july 31st fatal frame 4 the mask of the lunar eclipse

944
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,600
And also on the 31st rhythm tengoku gold

945
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,520
Another rhythm music game and fire emblem ds in on august

946
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,000
Seventh and uh, they had a little they have a screenshot or not really well a scan I guess

947
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,680
Of some of the stuff for wario land shake. It looks pretty cool. That's just like a platforming game and stuff

948
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:46,840
That's just like a platforming game and stuff. Um, let's see here also, um

949
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:53,480
There's um a new tournament going on for mario kart wii this one's a little different

950
01:11:53,560 --> 01:12:00,040
It's not just like a race and times and stuff like that. You're actually doing a boss battle and you're battling. Um,

951
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,680
The uh spiky top man from um, super mario galaxy

952
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:10,600
so that's kind of neat that they actually have almost kind of like download content for this game that you're um,

953
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,200
Fighting a new boss or something

954
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,120
I don't know why they include something like this in the game like maybe a story mode or something like that

955
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,040
But at the very least though, um, you can check it out for free

956
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,280
and um

957
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,320
the

958
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:28,440
Exclusive tournament and content ends june 9th. So if you want to check that out

959
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,520
Do it now

960
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,880
um

961
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,320
Let's see here

962
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,320
Apparently there's a that game next week grid that's coming out

963
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,040
Um, it's the xbox 360 version is apparently freezing up on people

964
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,680
uh-oh, so, um

965
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:51,400
Oh code masters is rushing to fix the game already, which I believe has been released in the uk already

966
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,920
But uh, you know, we'll be coming out soon maybe a day one patch or something like that. Um

967
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:03,720
Um, they say no, we're getting close through the problem and we're fixing or we will be including a fix and a backup work around option

968
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,600
Just in case in our forthcoming patch due within the next few weeks or sooner

969
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,160
Uh, we think the issue is due to a specific

970
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:17,640
Um drive hardware and possibly with uh bad blocks or sectors on your hard drive. So

971
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
interesting

972
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,520
Um, let's see here

973
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:28,300
Let's see here apparently nintendo of america has 100 we aware titles in development

974
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,480
I wonder how many of those are going to be crap

975
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,360
So that's interesting

976
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,520
And um, let's see here

977
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,960
There's some mobile games have been selling pretty well

978
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,500
Uh sonic mobile has hit 8 million downloads

979
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,960
Which is pretty amazing for a mobile game and guitar hero 3 mobile has made a 1 million

980
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,460
downloads, so that's kind of cool

981
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:59,660
Um, if you're interested in watching some original content from g4 or stuff that they used to have on their station

982
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,220
Um, you can check out

983
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,340
both

984
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:08,860
I think they have episodes of xplay on there now or attack of the show and stuff like that as well as

985
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,420
code monkeys

986
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:13,420
and I want to say there was a

987
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:20,780
Uh this block I guess which is um a snowboard documentary series that never really uh

988
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,580
debuted on the network

989
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:30,300
Huh, you know why they don't just put this stuff on their own network instead of I don't know cops marathons and cheaters

990
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,700
it's beyond me but

991
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,140
Who knows?

992
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,140
all right, and uh

993
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,380
That is pretty much it, all right

994
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:44,380
All right. Well that's gonna bring us to a close of another week of orange lounge radio

995
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,220
But not until we go around and get everybody's final thought loki your final thought tonight

996
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,060
Uh, my final thought is i'm gonna go cook some salmon

997
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,940
Uh, my final thought is I want to go eat some salmon, uh dark sakura

998
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,460

1004
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,980
