1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this live Part B that we're taping on June 1st of 2008.

2
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:12,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed, you're probably going, hey, wait a minute, I'm not hearing you guys live.

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:13,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can always join us.

4
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:21,614
[SPEAKER_07]: We tape live on allgames.com, that's All Games Radio, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern.

5
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:28,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, the man in Atlanta, Georgia tapes his show live on Sunday nights as well.

6
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you haven't heard his show, you really should check that out in iTunes.

7
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:33,638
[SPEAKER_07]: We make appearances on the show every week.

8
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:36,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby's kind enough to have us on the show to do a little cross-promotion.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:46,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of taping the show live, you guys in the podcast didn't get to hear this, but we were actually listening to some of the tracks from the Metal Gear Solid 4 soundtrack during the break there.

10
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:47,923
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you guys think of it?

11
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought some of it sounded pretty awesome.

12
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:50,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice help.

13
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic soundtrack is epic.

14
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:53,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, epic soundtrack is very epic.

15
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:57,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, I know you were watching some more scenes from Postal there during the break.

16
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:04,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm an hour 11 into it, and it's an hour 47 minute movie.

17
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:08,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of curiosity, those of you guys in chat, chat.orangellingerie.com.

18
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:08,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys enjoy that?

19
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:11,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know in chat.

20
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:16,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, we are going to get back into some gaming news here on this Part B. There's plenty of stuff to talk about.

21
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:22,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we mentioned the Wii at all in Part A. I got, by the way, I got a game this week, Boom Blocks.

22
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,240
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my friends kind of hooked me up with a copy of it.

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely legitimate.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,701
[SPEAKER_07]: He just had some inside connections, got me a pretty cheap copy of it.

25
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to checking it out.

26
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:34,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have a review on that next week.

27
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:37,084
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to talk about Boom Blocks right away, right?

28
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:37,304
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

29
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:38,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal, Still Alive DS

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,272
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember the Flash game that they had out there that was kind of similar to Portal?

31
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:04,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is kind of similar to that Flash game, a little bit more cartoony.

32
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:11,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you own a Flash card or a means of putting Homebrew on your DS, you can download this game for free.

33
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks pretty awesome, actually.

34
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:16,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Download it now before lawsuits.

35
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:20,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to because I have a Ninja Pass.

36
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:21,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely worth checking out.

37
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:27,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It uses the touch screen as well as some of the face buttons on there for launching different portals and stuff.

38
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:29,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So, pretty cool.

39
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:35,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I will have to play DarkSakura's copy because I don't think I'll be getting to check this out otherwise.

40
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,166
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounds interesting.

41
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:38,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hire a portal.

42
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:44,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to download that because, you know, me and my minor portal obsession, so I'll have to

43
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Folks in chat are playing it right now.

44
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:51,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo Maniac 64 says, ironically, I'm playing still live DS right now.

45
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have T says, it's rather hard to control.

46
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:54,943
[SPEAKER_07]: How the hell do I shoot the orange one?

47
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:56,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you guys can put your heads together.

48
00:02:57,024 --> 00:03:05,090
[SPEAKER_06]: The orange one is by pushing down on the directional pad or I want to say A. Or see if there's instructions and read them.

49
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Down or A and the two shoulder buttons are the blue portals.

50
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:10,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how you do it.

51
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you very much.

52
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,606
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like a Nintendo game counselor all of a sudden.

53
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:14,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

54
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:22,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have the screenshots of, or I guess artwork shots of the controls, so they're all over the internet.

55
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:32,226
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, the latest issue of Japan's Famitsu magazine has given us some insight as to what's going on with the SimCity series.

56
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:33,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the deal.

57
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:41,149
[SPEAKER_07]: SimCity Creator is going to be a new game in the SimCity vein, and it's going to be coming out for the Wii and the DS.

58
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:50,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be coming out September 22nd of 2008 for North America and September 19th, a little bit earlier, for Europe and the Japan and other Asia regions.

59
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:58,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the interesting thing is that the Wii game, what you can do, you can draw your own rivers or tracks using the Wiimote.

60
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,524
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually change the different styles of your buildings as well.

61
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:04,527
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do like a Chinese style building, an Indian design.

62
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:05,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of interesting.

63
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also make buildings made out of candy.

64
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:08,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

65
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:09,664
[SPEAKER_07]: or Christian.

66
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie got so excited she dropped the mic.

67
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:13,067
[SPEAKER_02]: On my laptop.

68
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,749
[SPEAKER_07]: She was like, ooh, a candy palace.

69
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like saying, you know, you can do like a gingerbread house.

70
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:23,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it makes me think of the opening scene or one of the opening scenes in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the newer one.

71
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the newer one with Johnny Depp?

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:25,980
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's great.

74
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:28,743
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'll say.

75
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:31,166
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a scene with a chocolate Indian palace.

76
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:31,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

77
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:36,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, also, it uses the Wi-Fi connection feature so you can show off the game to friends.

78
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:41,139
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool, especially when you draw those rivers shaped like penises.

79
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,790
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

80
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Blade3 in chat got very excited.

81
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,647
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, awesome, candy rules.

82
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Candy does rule.

83
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have Candyland.

84
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:18,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It does depend.

85
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you could actually make Candyland.

86
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:22,232
That'd be great.

87
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,195
[SPEAKER_07]: You could actually make Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

88
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,335
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be so awesome.

89
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:26,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

90
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a river of chocolate.

91
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:29,638
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

92
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:32,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want a wall that tastes like snozzleberry.

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:06:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no such thing okay anyway for people interested in other culinary related games that are actually related to food there's going to be another Cooking Mama World Kitchen to be released later this year around October-ish they actually have Majesco has a coming soon with a release date of October 30th

94
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also replacing Dinner with Friends.

95
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:08,322
[SPEAKER_06]: As you remember, there was Cooking Moment 2 on the DS.

96
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:15,485
[SPEAKER_06]: This was going to be Cooking Moment 2 on the Wii, but I don't know if they changed the title or are actually going to change the game.

97
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,366
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be coming out in June, now it's in October.

98
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,313
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have Redneck Cookin' Mama.

99
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:23,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm... They have a game... We make fish sticks.

100
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,636
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a game called Order Up.

101
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:27,057
[SPEAKER_07]: My roommate just ate that for dinner.

102
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:28,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you smell that inside the house or something?

103
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hilarious.

104
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually... This is also Redneck Foods.

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Fish sticks.

106
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny you should mention that.

107
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:35,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I walked in the house and I'm like, it smells good in here.

108
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,363
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you make for dinner?

109
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:37,124
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about fish sticks?

110
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:37,964
[SPEAKER_07]: He said fish sticks.

111
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:47,430
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said... Funny that you should mention like a Redneck Cooking game because they're going to have Order Up, which is basically like Cooking Mama, but you're working at like a fast food restaurant.

112
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:48,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

113
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,266
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have truck stop diner.

114
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:51,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

115
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:52,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't they have diner dash?

116
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:53,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same thing.

117
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:54,927
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

118
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:56,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, sorry.

119
00:06:57,248 --> 00:07:06,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I just hope Cooking Mama Wii kind of blew chunks compared to the DS version, so I really hope they do a better DS to Wii port this time.

120
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,110
[SPEAKER_02]: The closer you are to the screen, the more tight the control would be.

121
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I say.

122
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not enjoy Cooking Mama on the Wii, although I own it, and I'm kind of upset I do.

123
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:23,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, now the Wii was... The Virtual Console was supposed to be getting MSX games for quite a while.

124
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:30,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, Japan has had their first MSX game release, and it's a game called Aleste.

125
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:40,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's kind of interesting, though, is that there's been some additional options to this game that no other Virtual Console game has, including the...

126
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:58,149
[SPEAKER_06]: MSX option menu which allows you to select between the MSX hardware based music and the more advanced FM music that back when the MSX was actually a console was in add-on card.

127
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:04,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool that you can actually do this in the game by pressing the minus button.

128
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:10,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually just think that it's cool that they're getting that game because it's a really freaking good game.

129
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:15,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also do, I guess, there's some button change options as well thrown in there.

130
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

131
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:22,968
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat that they're adding all these options almost like an actual emulator for this.

132
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:30,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they don't do that with any of the other games that come out.

133
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope we get Gartic with the deluxe treatment.

134
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:34,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I know!

135
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

136
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:43,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

137
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:52,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, Toki Tori is a game that is coming to the North American virtual console, WiiWare.

138
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:54,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's not really a virtual console, but you know WiiWare.

139
00:08:55,169 --> 00:09:00,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 2D puzzle game, and it's going to cost you 1,000 points or 10 bucks.

140
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

141
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, this game's been fairly well-reviewed.

142
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:06,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little puzzle game.

143
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:06,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't like it.

144
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:07,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't like it?

145
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:07,938
[SPEAKER_07]: You played it?

146
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:08,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

147
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:08,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you describe it?

148
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't know much about this game.

149
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like... I don't know.

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at screenshots and I go, it looks a little Lode Runner-ish to me.

151
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:14,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

152
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:17,524
[SPEAKER_06]: You collect the eggs, basically, and then that's pretty much it.

153
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:22,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can hop around, jump different platforms with motion controls and stuff like that.

154
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:23,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

155
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be cool later on.

156
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:28,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't give it that much time, but it wasn't something that I was interested in.

157
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like Time Bird?

158
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:31,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that.

159
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:34,234
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's very basic, but...

160
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about something different?

161
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, different.

162
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual Console!

163
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

164
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,121
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in the UK.

165
00:09:53,801 --> 00:10:00,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Games out this time around are... We have Hello Pokemon Puzzle League.

166
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:02,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, why did I say hello?

167
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:03,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading from the thing.

168
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:08,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Pokemon Puzzle League has come out.

169
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also...

170
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:23,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Samurai Shodown, which makes me perfectly happy because it's the actual Neo Geo versions for their Neo Geo virtual console stuff.

171
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:27,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually it's going to be out for 900 Wii points, which is 630.

172
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:35,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and before I forget to mention, Pokemon Puzzle League is 1,000 points.

173
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:39,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Burning Fight is also the other one that's out today.

174
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:46,399
[SPEAKER_02]: for 800 points, which is sort of like a Streets of Rage type brawler.

175
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

176
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

177
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:53,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I would download these games if I had room.

178
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that does suck.

179
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like having to delete stuff to make room.

180
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Room sucks.

181
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:05,822
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a game coming out in the US actually that Japan's had for a while now.

182
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game called Tornado.

183
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:10,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of you may not be familiar with this game.

184
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:13,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually very similar to Katamari Damacy.

185
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:20,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And the game entails you playing a creature that basically becomes a tornado and you have to

186
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:28,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Much like Katamari, suck up smaller objects and make your tornado bigger and then you can suck up larger objects and stuff like that.

187
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:29,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasmanian Devil?

188
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

189
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be coming out on the DS in the fall.

190
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:39,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say September, I thought.

191
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw this in September.

192
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:42,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong though.

193
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:48,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's kind of neat and kind of a little quirky game that will be coming out here a little bit later on.

194
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep an eye out for that.

195
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something you've actually played?

196
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it, but I've just seen screenshots and video of it.

197
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:00,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Could this be the next big thing?

198
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be a big thing.

199
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,949
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a quirky little game though.

200
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be like worth checking out at least.

201
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:07,892
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well.

202
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan Carr's Novel, The Easy Way to Stop Smoking

203
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:38,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And what the game will do, this game's coming out in November, what you do, you pick a coach, I guess, in this game, and you create a program based on your smoking habit.

204
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:51,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically what the easy way method does is that you educate smokers about how addiction happens, convince them that whatever type of great feelings you get from smoking, you get from...

205
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:55,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you can curb that stuff.

206
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And you try to stop the emotional dependency.

207
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of strange, though.

208
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,771
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all coming out as a video game.

209
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:05,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, I don't know, interesting.

210
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:07,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really strange for Ubisoft.

211
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know, though, are there Rabbids in this?

212
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:11,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, that would be funny.

213
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,380
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

214
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to stop smoking.

215
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:13,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah!

216
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:20,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's interesting that the DS is branching out like this, so to speak.

217
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:24,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, brain draining has kind of led to a lot of these outside-the-box type games.

218
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:25,937
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to tell you what.

219
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:28,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to be a smoker, and I quit.

220
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:31,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, I was not a very heavy smoker, but enough where I was addicted.

221
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: In my mind, I don't know.

222
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,522
[SPEAKER_07]: This might be a personal opinion.

223
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably get hate mail over this.

224
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:44,226
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only way you can quit is to, when you say, I'm going to quit, quit, and then do it cold turkey.

225
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:48,469
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's one of those things where when you say it, mean it.

226
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,350
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't have that huge dependency either.

227
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe that's how I was able to get away with the patch.

228
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:59,732
[SPEAKER_06]: What this game does, though, is when you have the urge to buy cigarettes, it gives you different Ubisoft game options that you could purchase.

229
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:05,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, instead of buying a pack of cigarettes, how about you buy quick yoga?

230
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:07,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Far Cry.

231
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Far Cry.

232
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:11,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how about purchase the My Weight Loss Coach?

233
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:12,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes with a pedometer.

234
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:13,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff like that.

235
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,478
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how this game's gonna work.

236
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:19,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee says, can't wait till Alcoholic Hero comes out for the TS.

237
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,301
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

238
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think this will be an effective game?

239
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that any tool is effective if someone believes in it.

240
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:39,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of it has to do with willpower and whatever... And I hate to use this term, but if the crutch works for you, then use it.

241
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:40,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

242
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:42,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

243
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:44,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of iffy about it.

244
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:53,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Just anyone who says that anything is easy is usually trying to... I mean, they are trying to sell you something.

245
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:57,439
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to feed you crap when all you need to do is just

246
00:14:58,999 --> 00:14:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's willpower.

247
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know not a lot of people have a lot of willpower, and I know that it is a physical addiction.

248
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,228
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a drug, and people are addicted to it.

249
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,673
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's one that withdrawing from will not kill you.

250
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:12,195
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to ride it out.

251
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, has anyone learned anything from Metal Gear?

252
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

253
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,922
[SPEAKER_06]: You can eat tree frogs.

254
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

255
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at what happened to Snake.

256
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he smokes cigarettes, he has to fight this crazy war, fight giant mechs.

257
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to fight giant mechs?

258
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:30,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He smuggled his smokes in his stomach.

259
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:33,095
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why...

260
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:36,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I have nothing.

261
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:45,838
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, this game is stupid, and if you're suckered into buying it, then I'm sure Nintendo has a few other training programs that they can send your way, including vision training.

262
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they're going to have hearing training coming up soon.

263
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Poop training.

264
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:50,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Poop training.

265
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Consumer horror training.

266
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:54,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And how.

267
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,728
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and again, I'm going to stick by this.

268
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything is possible if you're willing to work for it.

269
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:07,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything worth having is worth putting effort into, right?

270
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:08,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

271
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on how much you want it.

272
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:19,529
[SPEAKER_07]: My whole thing is that if you really, really, really want to quit smoking, if you really want to do it, you don't need a game.

273
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:21,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just do it.

274
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,430
[SPEAKER_07]: A game might help, but you don't need it.

275
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:30,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like heroin, you know, where you could, you know, I guess have a bunch of complications from withdrawal, but...

276
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:36,399
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need to buy a book to tell you how to quit something, that's retarded.

277
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:37,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

278
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It is retarded.

279
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:41,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

280
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,167
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I quit something?

281
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop doing it.

282
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really need to buy a book for that?

283
00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:00,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say this because I will freely admit that there's lots of things that I have kind of poor willpower about.

284
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:10,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that if you just sort of say, nothing changes until you are ready to make it change and then do what you need to do to make it change, right?

285
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:15,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that you just have to want it bad enough to put the effort into it.

286
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it bad enough, you'll do it.

287
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.

288
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:24,771
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we'll see how this game does and what type of floodgates it'll open if it does really well.

289
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:26,573
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, let's talk about smoking.

290
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:30,035
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I have no pity for people who say, I can't stop smoking and hold a cigarette in their hand.

291
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:31,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

292
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:32,537
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it.

293
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:34,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish my mom would quit.

294
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, guess what is coming out in Japan?

295
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:42,225
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of stuff, including the gardening game.

296
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:43,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Poop training?

297
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:46,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Is poop training coming out in Japan?

298
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:49,171
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they actually have toilet training cartoons.

299
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I asked.

300
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,212
[SPEAKER_02]: With a toilet that sings to you.

301
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:53,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I asked.

302
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And poop that laughs as it exits the body.

303
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:58,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really sorry I asked.

304
00:17:58,841 --> 00:17:59,522
[SPEAKER_02]: They're funny, though.

305
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:03,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they're getting a Fatal Frame 4...

306
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:10,167
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like your gory ghost games, then that one is definitely going to be the one to go for.

307
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:16,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's by Tecmo Grasshopper Manufacturer Collaboration putting this out together.

308
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:20,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fatal Frame 4 can be also called Poltergeist Snap.

309
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:21,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Poltergeist Snap?

310
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:22,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

311
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:24,198
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good name for that.

312
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:24,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

313
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,621
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically you go around and shoot pictures of dead people.

314
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,061
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

315
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Does your character at any point go, I see dead people?

316
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I develop film of dead people.

317
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:37,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only porn if you tape it.

318
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:50,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of Fatal Frame, they should have Fatal Cam where you videotape certain places and then have to run it through a spectral analysis to have everything show up on film.

319
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:56,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still waiting for WhatTheyPlay.com Snap because that was the picture-taking game I was looking forward to.

320
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:57,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

321
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:57,837
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

322
00:18:59,058 --> 00:18:59,258
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

323
00:18:59,318 --> 00:18:59,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

324
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:03,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Raving Rabbids

325
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:36,522
[SPEAKER_06]: TV Party and you sit on the balance board and use your ass to play different mini games in Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

326
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,224
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of a party game sort of situation there.

327
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:53,747
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the games they show is actually sliding down a hill on what looks like an upside down moose and you are using your ass to balance yourself as you go down the hill.

328
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:54,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, kind of fun.

329
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:56,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Moose.

330
00:19:56,774 --> 00:19:59,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Other options they're going to have in the game, too, are other minigames.

331
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:06,517
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have a dancing minigame where you have to do different things, different poses and stuff, which will also use the balance board.

332
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:09,058
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks kind of neat.

333
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, the raving rabbits are very funny.

334
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,679
[SPEAKER_06]: This needs to become a sitcom.

335
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,461
[SPEAKER_06]: The rabbits, just in ordinary life, kind of like a Garfield thing.

336
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be funny.

337
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Should do like Joe's Apartment, but with... Yeah, yeah.

338
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I like where you're going there.

339
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

340
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:29,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's like Garfield, will there be a Nermal?

341
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,009
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

342
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,192
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I had to go back and read that again, Rob.

343
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:33,712
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

344
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:36,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Garfield minus Garfield is excellent.

345
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I had a discussion about this.

346
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:54,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We've decided that just looking at that either John Arbuckle, the main guy, is either really, really, really sad or mad, like Looney Tunes.

347
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:55,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a little of both.

348
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:57,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

349
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:09,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what makes me really, really sad and then really, really mad is the fact that I can't find Wii Fit anywhere because the game sold out as fast as it came out and that is not yet back on shelves.

350
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:18,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of those crazy game industry analysts, Michael Patcher, talked to the LA Times about the Wii Fit supply and how it's so short.

351
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,392
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very interesting what he says is the reason for this.

352
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:24,593
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of the value of the dollar.

353
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:28,499
[SPEAKER_07]: The shortage demonstrates one consequence of the weak dollar.

354
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing companies ignore their largest market simply because they can make greater profit elsewhere.

355
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:37,816
[SPEAKER_07]: They know that Americans will be just as fat a few months from now.

356
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:46,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though there has been about half a million copies of Wii Fit shipped to the US, there have already been about 2 million in Europe.

357
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

358
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things are going at really crazy prices on eBay.

359
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:54,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Like $180 and stuff like that.

360
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:55,445
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dumb.

361
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like Wii's when they first came out.

362
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:58,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.

363
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Alpha Canogram in chat says, Sky should have pre-ordered it.

364
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:03,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, I didn't know if the game would be any good.

365
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,592
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of money to drop on a game you don't know that much about.

366
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:07,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

367
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:07,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

368
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:13,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And then honestly, though, I think they're giving... They kind of blame everything on the weak US dollar now.

369
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:14,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's a shortage.

370
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Must be the weak US dollar.

371
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really think they put that much thought into it, to be honest.

372
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:28,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just... They fucked up yet again, and so... I mean, because what would be the point of releasing... Like, for example, Mario Kart.

373
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:29,545
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a shortage...

374
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:33,747
[SPEAKER_06]: The week it came out, and then there was a lot more later on next week.

375
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:37,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're telling me that the dollar turned around within that week.

376
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow doubt that.

377
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:47,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Much like I doubt that once these stores get replenished with more product, that, oh, it's because the dollar turned around.

378
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:50,638
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it's just because they're retard and poor planning.

379
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:51,259
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

380
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:58,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Akuma JP is one of our listeners in Japan and he says there's fit everywhere here.

381
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:05,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, the game's been out a lot longer there, but what I thought was interesting that he said is a lot of used here, so I think it's not that good.

382
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:08,226
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently a lot of them are being turned right around in Japan.

383
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ship one to me.

384
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:10,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play it.

385
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we play it on the American Wiis though?

386
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:13,387
[SPEAKER_07]: They're region locked, right?

387
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:14,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can.

388
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:16,468
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get the... Can you?

389
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they figure out the... It's just the weight limit's not as high.

390
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:21,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they patched the freeloader.

391
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:23,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Freeloader should work now.

392
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:26,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, remember that homebrew channel that we were talking about last week?

393
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:35,215
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the Gecko Freeloader that you can use on there, which is a basically region-free player for your Wii games.

394
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:35,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

395
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's homebrew.

396
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:37,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And free.

397
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,877
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, I can't get my porn.

398
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:41,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It must be the weak US dollar.

399
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:43,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't get his porn.

400
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:50,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if that were the case, then we wouldn't be able to buy any games because everyone would be selling them in different regions.

401
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,150
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just retarded.

402
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,491
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they say porn is rescission-proof.

403
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:54,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

404
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:55,571
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

405
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:59,672
[SPEAKER_07]: CrunkyBoyJr says, I'm sure Nintendo does this on purpose to create a demand.

406
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,213
[SPEAKER_07]: They do.

407
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

408
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,213
[SPEAKER_06]: This is retarded now.

409
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:07,355
[SPEAKER_06]: They want this to be the big Christmas item, and that's what they're going to do.

410
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:13,637
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to make this just like the Wii system, and it's going to be a shortage for like a year and a half.

411
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:14,617
[SPEAKER_07]: You watch.

412
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:16,394
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll see.

413
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:19,035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see what you, the listener, have to say.

414
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:22,595
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always email us every week, mailbag at orangelaundrader.com.

415
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:29,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And every week, DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorite emails and reads them to you in a little segment we call the OLR Mailbag.

416
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:33,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So, DarkSakura, dive in to mailbag at orangelaundrader.com.

417
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:35,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Pull out a few of your favorites and read them.

418
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,019
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them were my favorites, so the end.

419
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:42,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice try.

420
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this one comes from Cheeseburger.

421
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:48,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finally reading one of your emails, so leave me alone.

422
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:55,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, I'm going to get an Xbox 360 Pro soon and I want some recommendations.

423
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:59,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I got my first BSOD after playing six hours of StarCraft.

424
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:01,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I never found out what the problem was.

425
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:03,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you're playing six hours of StarCraft.

426
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably heat.

427
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:07,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, StarCraft's pretty awesome though.

428
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Or your computer's like, stop playing StarCraft!

429
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:11,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Play something else.

430
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:11,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck!

431
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:18,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a broad question though about the whole Xbox 360 recommendations.

432
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:20,276
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you like?

433
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:21,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It really depends.

434
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:24,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us some games that you do like and that'll be good.

435
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:32,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess otherwise games that everybody seems to like, at least if you're listening to this show, I can kind of already tell you probably must like the RPG.

436
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:37,424
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not as into sports games, let's say, because we don't talk a lot about those unless it's like Tecmo Bowl.

437
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Geometry Wars Marvel Ultimate Alliance

438
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:10,577
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get that on multiple systems.

439
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:13,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I still go back and play that all the time.

440
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,098
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you're a racing game fan?

441
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,699
[SPEAKER_07]: What's one of the better racing games on Xbox 360, you think?

442
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I still like the last Burnout game.

443
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham 3 was okay.

444
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:26,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess it depends.

445
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:32,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Box suggests Actdeft, which is definitely Portal and other great shooter games if you like first-person shooters.

446
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw, Samus is not in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, it's Iron Man.

447
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:46,889
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Samus is in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, or was going to be in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but got cut out for the Wii version.

448
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:56,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone found it in the PlayStation 2 version, because you know the code that they just edit out or whatever, or comment out.

449
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,091
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of interesting.

450
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to have to find this then.

451
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:01,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

452
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:02,972
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a video out there.

453
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:04,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Kotaku ran it.

454
00:27:04,313 --> 00:27:05,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see maybe even Joystick.

455
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:07,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

456
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:08,770
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some suggestions.

457
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:14,491
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want more, I guess, tell us what kind of games you do like and that'll give us some places to start.

458
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:17,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, next email.

459
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I read it?

460
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:18,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I?

461
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:19,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

462
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:20,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

463
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:22,593
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes from Lycan.

464
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:24,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR.

465
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:25,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

466
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:26,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

467
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:29,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought that I would say hi and keep up the good work.

468
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:36,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering if any of you have seen the video of using the Wii with WoW and if not, I'll send it to you.

469
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:40,133
[SPEAKER_02]: He did send a link to it, but I'm not going to watch it.

470
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:46,256
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he thinks it's going to like our comments, but why don't we watch it and comment back on it next week?

471
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so, because I've heard of it, but I haven't really watched it.

472
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:52,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jamie, it'll be your responsibility to make sure we watch it for next week.

473
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

474
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have hiccups now.

475
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:58,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email!

476
00:27:58,823 --> 00:27:59,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, ma'am.

477
00:27:59,502 --> 00:28:00,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR.

478
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:00,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

479
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:10,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been listening to your awesome show for some time now, and I was just wondering what kinds of places you get your news-slash-release dates from.

480
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,848
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't read it on air or don't feel like revealing them, it's no big deal.

481
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:14,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious.

482
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:15,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

483
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:16,049
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

484
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:20,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Breadsticks are brought to you by this email home of the never-ending Olive Gardens by Amplitude.

485
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:23,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Amplitude.

486
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:29,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the three of us, we probably look at like a hundred different gaming news sites and blogs out there on the internet.

487
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:31,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll tell you a little bit about how it works behind the scenes.

488
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:38,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Behind the scenes, we keep a little thread in a private forum that nobody but the hosts and some of the other OLR people who've worked with us for many years can see.

489
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:43,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, when stories are interesting, we put them in this post and then we

490
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:44,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

491
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:15,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, though, where I get my release dates from, since it's come up on the show as a question before, is that I do actually get my release dates from Eurogamer, which is just great overall.

492
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get my Japanese release dates from import game stores.

493
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,099
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

494
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Although sometimes I will use, just on my own, I will actually use some of the video game retailers in the UK to verify a few dates.

495
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:34,507
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, on the other hand, Loki sometimes has insider info on the US release dates thanks to, you know, the stuff that he does, so...

496
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:35,367
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, What is OLR?

497
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:36,548
[SPEAKER_07]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

498
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to point out there's other people that contribute to the stories you hear on the show.

499
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,843
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya also posts in our thread.

500
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And once in a while, Travis Donovan and DMN poke their head in there when they see something really interesting.

501
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:15,989
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not just the three of us that contribute the stories, but just everywhere.

502
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our eyes everywhere.

503
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: The terrorist story from Part A was actually a link given to me last night by my friend who's busy doing a programming test applying for Namco.

504
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, I'm tired of doing this.

505
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:34,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, look at these links.

506
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: They're funny.

507
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:35,262
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

508
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:37,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get them from people.

509
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,524
[SPEAKER_02]: The other week I actually got from Ranma, so that was cool.

510
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:41,465
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

511
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So next email.

512
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:44,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Dun, dun, dun.

513
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:45,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Amplitude.

514
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:48,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's Amplitude with a Y, so I'm saying Amplitude.

515
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:51,870
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this comes from Kevin.

516
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:51,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin.

517
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Kevin.

518
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:19,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in San Jose and you can read all the info at www.caexpo.com or just California Extreme into Google and Firefox, your rail bar, blah, blah, blah.

519
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be my first time going and it would be a kick to see what anyone else thinks of it from their first time.

520
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:27,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work and join the show.

521
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:28,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit the fair by accident.

522
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And join the show as I'm typing from work, huh, Kevin?

523
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't tell your boss, Kevin, because I do this all the time too.

524
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I have never been to California Extreme, but I want to go this year.

525
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:40,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually ran into Mel and Melody there last year.

526
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:44,230
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a hotel, and they live there.

527
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:44,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's funny.

528
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:47,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you want to get away.

529
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:49,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, in what?

530
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:49,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Where everyone knows your name?

531
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:58,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, last year was my second California Extreme, and it's just a freaking blast.

532
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:05,141
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it's air-conditioned, which gives it major, major points over Pentagogo right then and there.

533
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:06,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

534
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you go up to the desk, you pay your money, you walk in, PINBALL!

535
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

536
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:21,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just pinball too, it's old classic games, like they had the Journey game there, Rob.

537
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:24,208
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm fucking sold on this.

538
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:27,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a full game of Space Harrier.

539
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:28,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat Space Harrier, Rob.

540
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,271
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's all on free play, right?

541
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

542
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:32,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're definitely going.

543
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:33,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely go on.

544
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,028
[SPEAKER_02]: They had... Oh, God, what else was it?

545
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that game where you slide a pole back and forth and you're sort of like a tug-of-war game where you... Oh, I thought it was Incredible Maze or whatever that game was.

546
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:46,538
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

547
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:49,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where you have to either run them into or push it from the other side.

548
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whoever's stronger, but you win matches out of it.

549
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:53,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually... I beat...

550
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:55,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did I beat?

551
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:56,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember who I beat.

552
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:57,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat Will.

553
00:32:58,307 --> 00:32:58,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That was who I beat.

554
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:01,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So look, there's your long answer to the short answer of yes, we're going.

555
00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:02,609
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more.

556
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked for opinions of whoever had their first time.

557
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:10,173
[SPEAKER_02]: They also, it is an Ultracade sort of show-off type place.

558
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do have Ultra Pin there.

559
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:13,515
[SPEAKER_02]: They did last year.

560
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:22,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ultra Pin is a plasma TV the size of a pinball table with LEDs and everything up and it emulates different tables.

561
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just really cool.

562
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,462
[SPEAKER_02]: and they also have room with machines for sale.

563
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:32,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to take home a bit of classic joy, you can nab a machine for cheap.

564
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:33,888
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Alpine Racing.

565
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:35,129
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, who's going to take that home?

566
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, no one has room for that.

567
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, if you want to meet up, because I'm definitely going to go, shoot another email and we'll make arrangements for meeting up there.

568
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they do panels there or anything?

569
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:52,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe they do panels.

570
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:53,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we ought to look into that.

571
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:55,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll have to see.

572
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:58,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But California Extreme is just tons of fun.

573
00:33:58,568 --> 00:33:59,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of fun.

574
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:01,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, really long email.

575
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:04,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Long email is long.

576
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Long email is long.

577
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:08,734
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, but, but, this is from Katamari's Forever.

578
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:10,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to read it.

579
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:12,616
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

580
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:12,736
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

581
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:14,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

582
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:16,848
[SPEAKER_07]: He's watching that movie while you're reading emails.

583
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

584
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:18,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm watching something else.

585
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

586
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:19,451
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

587
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:20,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you gotta tell.

588
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:20,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret porn?

589
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:22,715
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cat battle bot.

590
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:25,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a battle bot that is controlled by a cat.

591
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And it rides in it.

592
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is the coolest thing ever.

593
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:29,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

594
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted a link already in chat.

595
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:32,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

596
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:33,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can I read this okay?

597
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:37,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, OLR.

598
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:40,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I trust you have had a pleasant weekend so far.

599
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:47,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, since I didn't write a letter for the past couple of weeks, I wanted to put out a few things out of the open.

600
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:56,009
[SPEAKER_02]: With the school year ending in a couple of weeks for me, and the raging sense of boredom I feel I'm going to get, I decided to stock up on summer games!

601
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:07,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the titles coming out in the June, July, August months are slim pickings, I've got more than enough games to hold me over from the A-list Wii titles to Lost via Domus.

602
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:17,736
[SPEAKER_02]: While I live close to the border to Canada, I frequently shop there, and Canadian EB Games already has a game day sale out late June.

603
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:26,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for the summer sales here, and I hope I can find a copy of Rez, PS2 version, I don't have a 360, or, excuse me, Guitar Man for dirt cheap.

604
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you're looking forward to playing other than WoW, Ragnarok, and GTA 4?

605
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the world to end with you.

606
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:38,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want the Iron Man game.

607
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:40,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being denied.

608
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:42,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys?

609
00:35:44,596 --> 00:35:45,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Games we want?

610
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:46,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

611
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking forward to playing in the summer.

612
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:51,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

613
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:55,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be honest, not a lot I can think of right now.

614
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:58,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Fit, whenever I can get my hands on it, I think will be fun to play.

615
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially after the little demo I had the other week.

616
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:03,904
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as games I'm really looking forward to, I can't think of a lot right now.

617
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:05,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to hula hoop in your underwear?

618
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:05,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

619
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:06,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to hula hoop in your underwear?

620
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:07,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I just might.

621
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We should get you some underoos.

622
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:09,546
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank you.

623
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:12,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, were you looking forward to anything?

624
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:20,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking forward to Saints Row 2, but I can't now because...

625
00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:21,808
[SPEAKER_07]: later news.

626
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:24,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 4 DS, if that ever comes out.

627
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's coming out this summer.

628
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:26,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it this summer?

629
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:28,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's the end of July.

630
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:29,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the Civilization game.

631
00:36:29,414 --> 00:36:29,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

632
00:36:30,434 --> 00:36:30,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

633
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to... I thought I might be looking forward to Grid.

634
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:36,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I'm going to pick that up.

635
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:40,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the next game I have on order is... Oh, shit.

636
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:43,705
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Good to Heart Hero on DS, but I don't think I want that anymore.

637
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:44,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

638
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

639
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:54,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I may just get one of those DS R4s or R6s or wherever they are now and just homebrew.

640
00:36:54,718 --> 00:36:56,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I might buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith for laughs.

641
00:36:58,537 --> 00:37:01,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to continue because I don't know.

642
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do.

643
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:06,821
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm still waiting for is my Okami covers.

644
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:07,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

645
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:07,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

646
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered one the week of when you said how to get one and I'm still waiting for it a month after.

647
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:14,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you gotten your cover yet?

648
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:14,705
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

649
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:15,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And does it look cool?

650
00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:16,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

651
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:19,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find out.

652
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:20,771
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool on the website.

653
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:28,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, after reading some rave reviews and some really odd statistics, I picked up a copy of Grand Theft Childhood from my local library.

654
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:34,311
[SPEAKER_02]: While I haven't read a whole lot of it, finals week soon, have to cram, I have to say I'm quite impressed.

655
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:43,864
[SPEAKER_02]: They somehow debunk all of the gaming myths such as violence and sex and shed some light on the hot topics like what girls actually play and how violent video games reduce stress.

656
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:49,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to finish it as well as my newly acquired copy of Katamari Damacy.

657
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say I was...

658
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:59,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little five-year-old boy again after hearing the news about DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 last week.

659
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:08,099
[SPEAKER_02]: While I know most of the world has moved on with other lavish music games, I'm still anticipating the release of one of the best franchises Japan has ever given birth to.

660
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I must be the only one in Michigan who cares about this now.

661
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:14,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Konami, are they... What, Rob?

662
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:15,684
[SPEAKER_02]: You're grabbing the mic.

663
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:16,925
[SPEAKER_07]: No, nothing.

664
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it for support?

665
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just getting ready in case I think of a witty comment.

666
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:20,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

667
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:25,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Konami, are they really serious in releasing Rock Revolution in its current form?

668
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:30,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they should just change the engine to Unreal 3.1 and put arrows instead of colored cues.

669
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:42,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, Konami and Bemani should just release a guitar-slash-drum-freakish type game and ditch the rock-and-roll-is-in vibe that just makes them sing like copycats of their own concept.

670
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:51,794
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully the DLC in Hottest Party 2 will be one unlockable key that unlocks everything and more for just 200 points or less.

671
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We could hope, but will they?

672
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:54,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

673
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Three more things.

674
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:57,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for giving us a countdown.

675
00:38:58,099 --> 00:38:59,439
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Dr. Mario online?

676
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you really send Wii friends a demo?

677
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,963
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, yes.

678
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:06,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody has sent me a demo, but I haven't bought the game myself yet.

679
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't get copies because we're not special.

680
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to buy them just like you.

681
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:15,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, are you going to Penny Arcade Expo?

682
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:16,368
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the plan.

683
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:19,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I will know for sure in a couple weeks, but I am planning on going.

684
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ferret, are you really going to be in a horror movie as the slasher that kills everyone?

685
00:39:24,935 --> 00:39:26,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should let the ferret answer that, don't you think?

686
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:31,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you should give... Oh, you shouldn't give so much plot details away.

687
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret's... You know what, Ferret?

688
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's good enough, baby.

689
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:40,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the other one that made the different noises.

690
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the wolfy looking one.

691
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:42,562
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's kind of cool.

692
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:43,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

693
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:46,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I regret that this letter is very super long.

694
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:51,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that I had to say was on my mind and I really didn't have the time until now.

695
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:55,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Until then, your favorite emailer freeway shuffling to the next DVR iteration.

696
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:56,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Katamari's forever.

697
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

698
00:39:57,497 --> 00:40:03,403
[SPEAKER_02]: This message should be brought to you by the Olive Garden, but instead it's currently asking permission to be endorsed by Bobby Blackwolf.

699
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, as Katamari's Forever wrote, Boobie Blackwell.

700
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Best typo ever.

701
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's his cousin.

702
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a typo, but it's funny.

703
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:14,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more emails and they're little.

704
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:15,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, are they short?

705
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:15,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

706
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:16,512
[SPEAKER_07]: J-Rod.

707
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys.

708
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:22,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, J-Rod.

709
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick comment.

710
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:33,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just listening to episode 279 at work the other day when Loki started his rant about Wii Fit and how Nintendo is just trying to find a new market of soccer moms and people who watch Oprah.

711
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:37,068
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of his rant, I found myself almost clapping with my headphones on.

712
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Loki echoes my thoughts around the world.

713
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,212
[SPEAKER_02]: This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of never-ending salads and breadsticks.

714
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:44,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't encourage him.

715
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:46,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say anything.

716
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it.

717
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:48,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.

718
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:48,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart.

719
00:40:51,684 --> 00:40:52,484
[SPEAKER_02]: You know he likes it.

720
00:40:52,764 --> 00:41:00,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I was just wondering if you were going to do a show on a Saturday on a long weekend like you talked about a while back.

721
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:04,408
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR goes past midnight where I live and I have to get up at 5 in the morning.

722
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,649
[SPEAKER_02]: The show is comedy gold and I will listen until it is long dead like DDR.

723
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for putting on such a good show week after week.

724
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:11,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's BHK667.

725
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know so much about Saturday, but we did talk about doing a show around noontime, so we should still make sure that happens at some point.

726
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometime over the summer.

727
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,213
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we should do?

728
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:23,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it would probably kill us.

729
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:24,276
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

730
00:41:24,737 --> 00:41:26,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Do an all-night marathon.

731
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,882
[SPEAKER_06]: No way we'd die.

732
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:28,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know I'm not...

733
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:34,667
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I remember what happened when we did a marathon show at the tournament we had at Scandia.

734
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,908
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't fun, because you run out of things to talk about.

735
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:47,915
[SPEAKER_07]: If we found something, though, to keep things interesting, like maybe rotating out old classic video games for a night or something, or we did it for charity or something, there might be a reason to do it.

736
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:48,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

737
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:50,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Labor Day weekend.

738
00:41:50,736 --> 00:41:51,537
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't hold your breath.

739
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so that's it for emails?

740
00:41:55,673 --> 00:42:15,945
[SPEAKER_07]: if you would like to contribute, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to go for now, more gaming news so as I kind of hinted when we were talking about games for the summer sorry, hold on, Black Wolf reminded me Labor Day weekend is the same as PAX for some reason I thought it was the weekend before so what's the next three day weekend after Labor Day weekend?

741
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:23,290
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe Thanksgiving that's not a three day weekend, Rob it's a four day weekend it's a four day pre-weekend whatever

742
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:25,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably won't be here.

743
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: How about... I don't know.

744
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:30,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make up our own holiday.

745
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:32,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

746
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:33,829
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure something out.

747
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:34,710
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make up a holiday.

748
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,450
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR day.

749
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:36,731
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

750
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:37,812
[SPEAKER_02]: We have OLR day.

751
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can all take off from work.

752
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:40,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

753
00:42:40,314 --> 00:42:40,614
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

754
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:42,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

755
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:42,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

756
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row 2 has been deleted to October 14th.

757
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:56,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, because I would imagine that Grand Theft Auto 4 is so awesome, so, you know, they have to spend the extra time making sure that Saints Row 2 doesn't suck.

758
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:05,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And, apparently, they're saying, you know, of course, marketing issues and product quality is the reasons for the... Uh-oh.

759
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:07,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Product quality?

760
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just making sure that the game's not so glitchy.

761
00:43:11,814 --> 00:43:15,437
[SPEAKER_06]: After all, we don't want another musical detailing the glitches in the game.

762
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do, but no one else does.

763
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

764
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's kind of cool that they're putting it out so late because that gives me enough time to be done with Grand Theft Auto 4.

765
00:43:25,984 --> 00:43:30,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I'll ever be done with Grand Theft Auto 4, but to the point where I can play another game.

766
00:43:32,288 --> 00:43:32,628
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

767
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:33,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Play games I already have.

768
00:43:56,604 --> 00:44:02,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Rugu is coming out from South Peak and it's a puzzle game coming out for 800 Microsoft points.

769
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $10.

770
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:05,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently it's a four-player game.

771
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,033
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be.

772
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:12,559
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you do, you slide pegs of different shapes into appropriate holes while you're trying to save an alien race.

773
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like the game Perfection, but a little different.

774
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:18,131
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds bizarro.

775
00:44:38,398 --> 00:45:06,933
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's also an 800 point price tag and it's coming out from Artec and we have a screenshot so it looks like a space game hence Galaxy but that's about it so you'll have to check that out when the demo comes out but if you've been for whatever reason secretly following Aces of the Galaxy and no more information than we do well then the payoff is this week there you have it payoff hey hmm hey hey listen what

776
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:09,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Galaga!

777
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:12,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

778
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:19,124
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a listing up for Galaga Legions for Xbox 360.

779
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually put up by the USK, which is the German version of the ESRB, and I would so try to pronounce it if I didn't suck completely at German, so whatever.

780
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, actually, that did remind me of something funny I found in GTA 4, by the way.

781
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:36,057
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll talk about that later.

782
00:45:36,938 --> 00:45:37,198
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

783
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:44,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, they have a billboard for something called Passwasser.

784
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:45,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Pisswater.

785
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:46,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

786
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:47,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny.

787
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

788
00:45:49,402 --> 00:45:52,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, it's a shooter.

789
00:45:52,504 --> 00:45:54,806
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about all we know.

790
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:56,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it's Galaga.

791
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:58,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not sprightly.

792
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,151
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and pixely.

793
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:01,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

794
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:27,298
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what though the weird thing about this is that it makes me think maybe it's an upgrade thing like pac-man versus was or not versus pac-man well i mean that was an upgrade but you know i'm thinking a pac-man championship edition kind of like that although pac-man championship edition is pretty awesome so if they are making a game like that but out of galaga that could be kind of cool because i actually like galaga so i don't know

795
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Galaga a whole lot.

796
00:46:29,696 --> 00:46:35,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a little charm thing that's the ship somewhere.

797
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:41,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I care for Galaga that much, but I don't know.

798
00:46:41,894 --> 00:46:45,376
[SPEAKER_06]: PENNY ARCADE was the highest grossing Xbox Live Arcade debut ever, earning $330,000 in its first three days.

799
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:48,198
[SPEAKER_06]: The prior record holder was Worms HD.

800
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:14,016
[SPEAKER_06]: and I guess in term of units sold on the Rainslake Precipice of Darkness was the third highest performer of 2008.

801
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:17,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

802
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

803
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:19,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good for them.

804
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:23,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have not bought the game, but I think I'm going to because I had a lot of fun with the demo.

805
00:47:23,805 --> 00:47:24,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

806
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:26,608
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Penny Arcade game, good for them.

807
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:29,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a funny game.

808
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:29,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that.

809
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:31,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars

810
00:47:49,306 --> 00:47:52,450
[SPEAKER_07]: is apparently making its way to Japan.

811
00:47:53,251 --> 00:47:54,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be in June.

812
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:56,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made its way to the June release calendar.

813
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:04,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, games that tend to show up in the Japanese calendar usually end up over here eventually.

814
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:06,315
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

815
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:45,628
[SPEAKER_07]: which we already have here, Neketsu, Coco, Dodgeball, Boo, for the Sega Master System, Rambo, for the Genesis, Phantasy Star 4, for PC Engine, which over here was TurboGrafx-16, Power Tennis, Days of Thunder, Paranoia, and Blazing Lasers, and for the Neo Geo, King of Monsters, Ninja Commando, and Art of Fighting 2.

816
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:48,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the Art of Fighting?

817
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:51,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's a character named after me in Art of Fighting.

818
00:48:51,866 --> 00:49:11,155
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I spent about 30 minutes today reading the Wikipedia article about Dan from the Street Fighter Alpha series and how he's a big parody of Rio and Robert Garcia with Yuri's taunts.

819
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

820
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:18,633
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know, are you excited about Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console, Loki?

821
00:49:18,813 --> 00:49:19,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I am pretty excited about it.

822
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have to wait for it to come out over here.

823
00:49:24,076 --> 00:49:25,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be waiting, Nintendo.

824
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:26,377
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sitting here waiting.

825
00:49:27,538 --> 00:49:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

826
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:29,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

827
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Then why don't you read a story or something?

828
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:32,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I will then.

829
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what else is going to be on the Wii?

830
00:49:37,297 --> 00:50:00,098
[SPEAKER_02]: The Beer Pong Game No, you have to guess though because I'm not going to read the story Well, I know the answer Tecmo Bowl Not the virtual console releases we've already got but we'll have Tecmo Bowl Kickoff which is a new football game that is going to be on the Wii so it's going to be on the Wii and we'll probably use a Wiimote

831
00:50:01,224 --> 00:50:16,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's football, that's about all that we've got details on But I'm sort of agreeing with this article that it has the stench of WiiWare about it Will it have the awesome halftime cutscenes that the NES version had?

832
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm hoping for I believe it's going to be on Wii and be about football Should cover about everything I know about that game Fine

833
00:50:27,523 --> 00:50:27,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Be that way.

834
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:28,643
[SPEAKER_07]: See if I care.

835
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

836
00:50:29,783 --> 00:50:31,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, our Skype line is going to be open very soon.

837
00:50:31,844 --> 00:50:35,064
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to get in on the fun.

838
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:37,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple more stories to read for you first.

839
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:37,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

840
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:41,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say also one thing too.

841
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:45,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to the Tecmo Bowl, it's interesting this here.

842
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:52,207
[SPEAKER_06]: You can customize your teams, everything down to the logos, to the player stats, names, etc.

843
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:55,288
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they're getting around not having the license.

844
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,660
[SPEAKER_06]: because you can make your own teams.

845
00:50:57,881 --> 00:50:59,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

846
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:00,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Smart.

847
00:51:01,382 --> 00:51:10,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, something else that's coming to consoles, well, not anytime soon, but eventually, Street Fighter 4.

848
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:18,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the cool things about Street Fighter 4 is other than online play, you'll be getting some new characters from the arcade.

849
00:51:19,729 --> 00:51:24,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And two of the characters that they showed concept art for, Fei Long and Dan.

850
00:51:25,651 --> 00:51:25,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

851
00:51:27,122 --> 00:51:28,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

852
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:36,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also supposedly more characters beyond just those two, but two's a start.

853
00:51:37,588 --> 00:52:06,480
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of interesting to see that they're adding characters from you know Street Fighter Turbo and stuff like that plus it's Dan and I'm sure that makes Jamie kind of happy yeah it's just because he cracks me up because I love that his one of his attacks is it translates to taunting legend and um uh shiny fist I love all of his attacks they're just hilarious I actually kind of like playing as Fei Long in the Street Fighter super game so I'm excited to hear he's in Street Fighter 4

854
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:09,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Sound he always made.

855
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

856
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:13,181
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

857
00:52:14,082 --> 00:52:17,844
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll be checking that out when Street Fighter 4 comes out here in America.

858
00:52:18,644 --> 00:52:20,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully sooner rather than later.

859
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:20,645
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

860
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, Steam.

861
00:52:23,486 --> 00:52:27,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked about Steam earlier when I was talking about AudioSurf, which I was reviewing earlier in the show.

862
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:31,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve has announced that there will be a new edition coming to Steam.

863
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:32,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Steam Clash.

864
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:33,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Cloud.

865
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:35,552
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a service that was announced this past week.

866
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: What it's going to do, it's going to store your Steam player data online and the cool thing about that is that you can access your saved games, keyboard configurations, all the games that you purchased through Steam from any computer anywhere.

867
00:52:49,056 --> 00:52:52,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was something that was announced earlier this week.

868
00:52:52,939 --> 00:53:01,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve is very committed to PC gaming and saying that PC retail is not doomed, even though they sometimes have these free weekend games on Steam.

869
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:04,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It just in turn supports stronger sales at retail.

870
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:06,569
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, some people just don't want to buy their games online.

871
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,471
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have to see how this turns out.

872
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:11,112
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds pretty cool in theory, doesn't it?

873
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:12,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

874
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:13,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see how that works.

875
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:14,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in theory.

876
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:16,296
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know how that's going to work.

877
00:53:16,787 --> 00:53:18,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the Skype line is now open.

878
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:20,410
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

879
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

880
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:25,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take a call.

881
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:26,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

882
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:27,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

883
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:29,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's GS68.

884
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:30,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Huzzah!

885
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:31,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Huzzah.

886
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:32,480
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

887
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:35,722
[SPEAKER_01]: So, California Extreme.

888
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:38,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to go check it out.

889
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:47,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, then we'll see you there, and hopefully we'll be able to do something there, although I don't know if it's last minute or what, but we'll do an OLR lunch or something, if nothing else.

890
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:53,557
[SPEAKER_01]: If I decide to go, that might throw me what little chance I have of going to Comic-Con this year.

891
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:56,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, decisions, decisions.

892
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:57,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Comic-Con I hear is pretty awesome.

893
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never been myself, but...

894
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:10,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

895
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:13,623
[SPEAKER_07]: If we go to California Extreme, we're probably only going to go for the day.

896
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:17,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about Jamie, but I see it as more of a day trip than a weekend trip, personally.

897
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:19,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's something I want to stay the night for.

898
00:54:19,665 --> 00:54:20,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm actually going to go for both days.

899
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:21,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

900
00:54:22,086 --> 00:54:22,686
[SPEAKER_07]: She's dedicated.

901
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:24,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly because I'm in the area.

902
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:26,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Santa Clara specifically.

903
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

904
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, gosh, it's right in your backyard.

905
00:54:29,868 --> 00:54:30,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

906
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:30,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go.

907
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:32,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

908
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:34,970
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like six miles from my house.

909
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well then you got nothing, you got nothing to worry about.

910
00:54:37,615 --> 00:54:40,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Santa Clara, you said you live in Santa Clara?

911
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:41,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

912
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:44,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I, uh, I might be going to Santa Clara around the time of my birthday.

913
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:50,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking of taking the day off work to go with, uh, my, uh, boyfriend and we can go ride some rides, so it'll be fun.

914
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

915
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:54,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've only been there once.

916
00:54:55,253 --> 00:54:57,014
[SPEAKER_01]: What critical thing you learned out of my Fanime report last week?

917
00:54:57,034 --> 00:54:57,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Swap meet.

918
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:58,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, how was the swap meet at Fanime?

919
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:24,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Best deals ever.

920
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:25,622
[SPEAKER_01]: How so?

921
00:55:26,562 --> 00:55:31,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you go to Kingdom Kingdom, for example, and buy a year beat CD, it's like $40.

922
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:35,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this guy over at the swap meet was selling those for only $10 each.

923
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

924
00:55:37,728 --> 00:55:40,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Now to get some other games that are cheap, Contra 4 for $18 and Amplitude for $3.

925
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:40,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

926
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:45,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I like bargains.

927
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:48,796
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing I missed about going down to... I almost called it out of my expo.

928
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:59,573
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I missed about going to Faname this year was getting to go to the dealer's room and the swap meet and all that good stuff and trying to get some good deals on shirts and stuffed animals and other chibi things.

929
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:03,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I did something cool happen when I was like getting Contra 4.

930
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:14,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a $100 bill and I offered to get only $80 and change back and to make it for a difference, you throw in an Ultramix 3 slash Extreme 2 sample CD.

931
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:16,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey.

932
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:19,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, little deals are pretty awesome sometimes.

933
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:20,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cool, cool.

934
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:26,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so to anyone listening, if you go to Anime Convention and don't go to swap meets, you're missing out.

935
00:56:26,669 --> 00:56:27,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Swap meets are great.

936
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:29,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I've looked into lots of good stuff at swap meets.

937
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:30,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

938
00:56:31,252 --> 00:56:38,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, GS6TO, we've got to let you go take some more calls, but it sounds like we'll be running into you at some Bay Area event in the near future, so take care, buddy.

939
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:43,134
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

940
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:45,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

941
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:46,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

942
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

943
00:56:47,275 --> 00:56:47,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, guys?

944
00:56:48,015 --> 00:56:48,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Toshin.

945
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:49,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Toshin.

946
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, my friend?

947
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

948
00:56:53,096 --> 00:56:56,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to know, Rob, if you've got picked up Super Dodgeball for the DS this week.

949
00:56:57,637 --> 00:56:58,777
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I forgot it came out.

950
00:56:58,837 --> 00:56:59,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get it?

951
00:57:00,222 --> 00:57:03,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually played my friend's copy and he loaned it to me.

952
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:03,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.

953
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:04,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

954
00:57:04,825 --> 00:57:05,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about this game.

955
00:57:06,046 --> 00:57:07,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it faithful to the original or what?

956
00:57:08,247 --> 00:57:09,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it's pretty faithful.

957
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:20,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I only got to play a multiplayer brawl, but you can apparently level up your players and there's like 14 or 15 different teams you can pick.

958
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:27,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And your super shots are apparently picked on your birth date that you enter whenever they ask you for it.

959
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:27,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

960
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:29,082
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of interesting.

961
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:35,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I don't know all the combinations of like the super shots, but my friend's is pretty cool.

962
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:42,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the one where, you know, when you run and it was like one of the slider ones that goes back and forth like a vertical ball.

963
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:42,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

964
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:45,455
[SPEAKER_03]: He had that one set up, which was kind of cool.

965
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:46,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

966
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:46,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get it.

967
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:48,987
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-Man Brawl 8-Man Brawl

968
00:58:17,242 --> 00:58:17,882
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

969
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

970
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:20,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?

971
00:58:20,624 --> 00:58:21,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other games you've been playing or what have you?

972
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:31,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been playing a lot because I've been working a lot, but I probably won't make use of the 600 or 800 Microsoft points you're going to give me.

973
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:35,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I finally got that over to you, so definitely check that out.

974
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:37,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're supposed to be getting ResHD with it.

975
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:39,074
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the deal, so check that out.

976
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, I'll make use of the points.

977
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely make use of the points and me and you are going to have to play like Rock Band or something soon or something.

978
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well I want full reviews on whatever you get later on, okay?

979
00:58:51,442 --> 00:58:51,802
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.

980
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:53,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take care Toshin, have a good one.

981
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:54,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, thanks.

982
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:55,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

983
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:59,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the reminder about that DS, Super Dodgeball DS.

984
00:58:59,484 --> 00:59:00,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea it was coming out.

985
00:59:00,505 --> 00:59:01,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, the phone's ringing off the hook tonight.

986
00:59:01,845 --> 00:59:02,885
[SPEAKER_07]: We're already into another call.

987
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:03,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

988
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:04,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

989
00:59:05,606 --> 00:59:08,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, this is Jammer J. Hello, Jammer J. What's on your mind?

990
00:59:08,707 --> 00:59:10,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe I've heard you call before.

991
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:10,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you called before?

992
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,466
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

993
00:59:34,986 --> 00:59:37,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to solely play an arcade version of DDR.

994
00:59:37,729 --> 00:59:38,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, good question.

995
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:43,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Farthest we've ever traveled to solely play an arcade version of DDR.

996
00:59:43,154 --> 00:59:45,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you have any answer for this?

997
00:59:45,136 --> 00:59:46,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's pretty much just like three hours, I think.

998
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:53,805
[SPEAKER_06]: We drove from here to San Jose or Milpitas to play some Japanese stuff there.

999
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:56,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember also we drove to Stockton Golf Land to play...

1000
00:59:57,549 --> 00:59:59,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme, I think.

1001
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Max 2 when it first came out.

1002
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:01,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Max 2 when it first came out.

1003
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:02,912
[SPEAKER_07]: They only had it stocked in Golf Land.

1004
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:04,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

1005
01:00:04,593 --> 01:00:05,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Do tournaments count?

1006
01:00:05,913 --> 01:00:10,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we drove all the way to San Diego once to go to a tournament at Raze, and San Diego's like a 10-hour drive from here.

1007
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:14,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was pretty, that's like one of the farthest I can think of.

1008
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you guys drove to like, was it the Japanese arcades?

1009
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:19,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade Infinity.

1010
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:30,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking, I didn't drive all this way to play DDR, but I have driven that whole way to play Beatmania 2DX would be Arcade Infinity, which is in LA, which is about a six and a half hour drive from here.

1011
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So how about you?

1012
01:00:32,817 --> 01:00:33,857
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the furthest you've ever driven?

1013
01:00:33,877 --> 01:00:40,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I think about six hours, but sometimes when I go on trips, I make it a highlight to hit up any DDR in the area.

1014
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think...

1015
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:42,201
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1016
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,251
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR tournament in Biloxi when I went back to visit

1017
01:01:31,725 --> 01:01:36,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you were out for a moment when the caller first called in, but he was wondering what's the furthest you've ever gone just to play DDR?

1018
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:37,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to play DDR?

1019
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:37,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1020
01:01:38,954 --> 01:01:42,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was saying, okay, Beatmania 2DX at least.

1021
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,355
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been Arcade Infinity, but that's a close thing.

1022
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:46,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I went to San Diego.

1023
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:50,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to San Diego anyway.

1024
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:57,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things I intended on doing was playing the DDR Max when it was new.

1025
01:01:57,899 --> 01:02:01,540
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because Raise was like the first place anywhere that had that, huh?

1026
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and played it.

1027
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:12,045
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's when I realized that the hold arrows hurt really bad because I've got a little bit of a weakness in my ankles.

1028
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:19,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, the farthest distance I've traveled and then played DDR was going back to Alabama from here.

1029
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:21,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's cool.

1030
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that Biloxi tournament at Boomtown?

1031
01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:25,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe it was.

1032
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:26,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a few years ago.

1033
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:28,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely before Katrina.

1034
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:31,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was when we had a max, they were just getting a fifth mix.

1035
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:38,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, I think I remember that, because my buddy was working at that arcade there in Boomtown.

1036
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:38,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1037
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:40,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Boomtown, now that I think about it.

1038
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Small world.

1039
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was that, the arcade was sort of off to the side, if I remember correctly.

1040
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:45,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1041
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:47,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a shiny, brand new machine.

1042
01:02:48,316 --> 01:02:51,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got up there, and I think I played, when did I play Superstar?

1043
01:02:52,879 --> 01:02:59,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was, no, it wasn't that, it was when I was, I had this thing about doing, what was it that I used to always play in Hidden?

1044
01:02:59,504 --> 01:02:59,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1045
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:04,269
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1046
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:28,192
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's a within two hours is Supernova 2 arcade so that's not too bad.

1047
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:28,813
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sweet.

1048
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there's a Supernova 2 in Roseville but I have yet to play it.

1049
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being from the south but I don't miss living there.

1050
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:39,305
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1051
01:03:58,956 --> 01:04:05,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the reason I don't play the home version so much is up here I don't have a good, since I live in an apartment complex, I can't use my Cobalt Flux.

1052
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on what you play at home on the actual platforms.

1053
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:16,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I had that problem when I lived with Extifer is that we lived upstairs and when I played DDR it wasn't fun for the downstairs people so I couldn't do that.

1054
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:25,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but other than that, some people in the home version they have just as much fun on it but I would need to really play in the arcade because I hit pretty hard on the pads.

1055
01:04:26,222 --> 01:04:26,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

1056
01:04:28,301 --> 01:04:33,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well Jammer J, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, so thanks for the call, and I hope we call you in again sometime, we like hearing from new folks.

1057
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:35,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out, and triple A. Peace out.

1058
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:37,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out!

1059
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:37,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1060
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:39,908
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the other thing you said?

1061
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:41,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Triple A?

1062
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Like car insurance?

1063
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess so.

1064
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe, you know, high score?

1065
01:04:44,872 --> 01:04:45,793
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR, triple A?

1066
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:49,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you make the machine go, oh!

1067
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: One more call.

1068
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:52,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1069
01:04:52,779 --> 01:04:53,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1070
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

1071
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,380
[SPEAKER_07]: God, you always get through.

1072
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the miracle dialing finger.

1073
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,460
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1074
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,220
[SPEAKER_07]: We like you, at least.

1075
01:04:59,280 --> 01:04:59,761
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1076
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:01,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

1077
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:04,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm recovering from Wizard World Philly, which was this weekend.

1078
01:05:04,782 --> 01:05:05,242
[SPEAKER_04]: From what?

1079
01:05:05,662 --> 01:05:06,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Wizard World.

1080
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:07,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Wizard World Philly.

1081
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:08,322
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that?

1082
01:05:10,403 --> 01:05:11,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Want me to be honest?

1083
01:05:11,723 --> 01:05:12,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course.

1084
01:05:13,263 --> 01:05:13,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucked.

1085
01:05:14,864 --> 01:05:15,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did it suck?

1086
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:24,946
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as they really said this would be a big comic book convention, I could tell you it looked like no more than 10,000 people showed up at least.

1087
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just quiet.

1088
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:28,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like bleh.

1089
01:05:28,628 --> 01:05:29,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1090
01:05:29,908 --> 01:05:30,769
[SPEAKER_07]: 10,000 sounds like a lot to me.

1091
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:32,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's no Comic Con, but still.

1092
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:37,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, the tournaments were kind of crappy too.

1093
01:05:38,052 --> 01:05:38,612
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

1094
01:05:40,626 --> 01:05:48,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that really pissed me off was the fact that somebody was there selling ROMs and emulators and ROMs for between $30 and $50.

1095
01:05:49,275 --> 01:05:52,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you can get really busted for that.

1096
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:57,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it's kind of illegal to begin with, but when you're selling it for profit, that's when they really go all out of the way to get you.

1097
01:05:58,285 --> 01:05:58,925
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to be careful.

1098
01:05:59,646 --> 01:06:00,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn them in.

1099
01:06:00,046 --> 01:06:02,209
[SPEAKER_07]: The funny thing is with – I said turn them in.

1100
01:06:03,598 --> 01:06:03,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1101
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:04,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1102
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:32,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, interesting.

1103
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:34,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me a little more about this con.

1104
01:06:34,508 --> 01:06:38,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It was comics and games and anime and all of that all rolled into one?

1105
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:39,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it.

1106
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:43,935
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more comic books than they add in a touch of science fiction and anime.

1107
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:45,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like Comic Con.

1108
01:06:46,357 --> 01:06:47,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what Comic Con does.

1109
01:06:47,558 --> 01:06:54,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Comic Con is supposed to be about comic books, but hello, the Battlestar Galactica people show up every year and it's turned into this big, big thing, so...

1110
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:58,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with Starbuck being there, it still wasn't that big, big, big thing.

1111
01:06:59,243 --> 01:07:00,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, too bad.

1112
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:00,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Starbuck was there?

1113
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:04,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my roommate was online for two hours to get her autograph.

1114
01:07:04,546 --> 01:07:04,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1115
01:07:06,508 --> 01:07:06,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1116
01:07:06,928 --> 01:07:09,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I've finally been catching up on Battlestar Galactica.

1117
01:07:09,449 --> 01:07:11,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the third season right now, so good times.

1118
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:14,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, overall, I don't think we're going back next year.

1119
01:07:15,313 --> 01:07:15,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, that's too bad.

1120
01:07:16,493 --> 01:07:17,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

1121
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:20,576
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Ranma, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1122
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:22,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick story.

1123
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:22,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1124
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:25,663
[SPEAKER_04]: About two weeks ago, I went to GameStop to pick up a game.

1125
01:07:25,723 --> 01:07:27,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Rumble Roses XX.

1126
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but I wanted the game.

1127
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:29,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that game.

1128
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:30,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

1129
01:07:30,606 --> 01:07:31,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that game.

1130
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:33,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I paid $12.99 for it.

1131
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:34,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't complain.

1132
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:35,128
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1133
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I do want that game.

1134
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:38,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, quite a lot.

1135
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:40,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Good music, right?

1136
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:41,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1137
01:07:41,672 --> 01:07:42,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Boobs.

1138
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:46,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, finish your story, Ranma.

1139
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:48,876
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta finish sometime tonight.

1140
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, no problem.

1141
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:57,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I'm picking up the game, there's a guy there who flat out says, turn-based RPGs suck.

1142
01:07:58,352 --> 01:08:00,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked at him, I'm like, what was that?

1143
01:08:00,192 --> 01:08:01,993
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, turn-based RPGs suck.

1144
01:08:02,073 --> 01:08:08,354
[SPEAKER_04]: And me and my roommate look at him, and I'm like, you've never played the classic games like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy?

1145
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:11,655
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks at me and my roommate and goes, oh, you guys must be in your 30s or your 40s.

1146
01:08:16,488 --> 01:08:18,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have slapped him right there in the store if I could.

1147
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Bastard, you should have.

1148
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:21,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Teach the kid a lesson.

1149
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Respect your elders, you little shit.

1150

[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my roommate goes, yeah, you're right.

1151
01:08:29,099 --> 01:08:30,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely correct.

01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell you what, I'm going to go home and have sex with my hot Asian girlfriend while you're fat with your five fingers.

01:09:58,441 --> 01:09:59,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring fire.

1166
01:09:59,983 --> 01:10:01,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, don't bring fire on the plane.

1167
01:10:01,324 --> 01:10:01,805
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't like that.

1168
01:10:01,845 --> 01:10:02,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I like fire.

1169
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:05,519
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1170
01:10:20,379 --> 01:10:20,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fun.

1171
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I didn't mind doing it, but still.

1172
01:10:23,782 --> 01:10:25,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob was in a really bad way last year.

1173
01:10:25,683 --> 01:10:27,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was bad.

1174
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:29,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's not talk about my crappy life.

1175
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:31,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about last-minute stories.

1176
01:10:32,048 --> 01:10:33,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you have anything tonight for us?

1177
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:34,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1178
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:49,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo actually had released some dates for Japanese game releases, and there's some new games on there that a lot of people might not know about, including, well, this one they showed off before, Mario Super Sluggers for the Wii, which is coming out June 19th there.

1179
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:55,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Band Brothers DX Resident Evil Zero Wario Land Shake Wario Land Shake

1180
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:13,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Paper Mario Type Game July 31st, Fatal Frame 4, The Mask of the Lunar Eclipse Rhythm Tengoku Gold

1181
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:31,862
[SPEAKER_06]: another rhythm music game, and Fire Emblem DS on August 7th.

1182
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:39,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have a screenshot, or not really, well, a scan, I guess, of some of the stuff for Wario Land Shake.

1183
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:40,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty cool.

1184
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like a platforming game and stuff.

1185
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:45,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1186
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:52,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there's a new tournament going on for Mario Kart Wii.

1187
01:11:52,735 --> 01:11:53,656
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's a little different.

1188
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just like a race and times and stuff like that.

1189
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:59,584
[SPEAKER_06]: You're actually doing a boss battle and you're battling...

1190
01:12:00,845 --> 01:12:28,475
[SPEAKER_06]: the spiky top man from Super Mario Galaxy so that's kind of neat that they actually have almost kind of like download content for this game that you're fighting a new boss or something I don't know why they include something like this in the game like maybe a story mode or something like that but at the very least though you can check it out for free and the exclusive tournament and content ends June 9th so if you want to check that out

1191
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:31,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it now.

1192
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:32,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1193
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:38,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there's that game next week, Grid, that's coming out.

1194
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:42,097
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox 360 version is apparently freezing up on people.

1195
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:43,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

1196
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

1197
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Codemasters is rushing to fix the game already, which I believe has been released in the UK already.

1198
01:12:51,986 --> 01:12:56,269
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will be coming out soon, maybe a day one patch or something like that.

1199
01:12:58,564 --> 01:13:09,551
[SPEAKER_06]: They say we're getting close through the problem and we will be including a fix and a backup workaround option just in case in our forthcoming patch due within the next few weeks or sooner.

1200
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:18,197
[SPEAKER_06]: We think the issue is due to a specific drive hardware and possibly with bad blocks or sectors on your hard drive.

1201
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:20,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1202
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:23,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1203
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:28,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Nintendo of America has 100 WiiWare titles in development.

1204
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:36,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder how many of those are going to be crap So that's interesting And let's see here

1205
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:40,139
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some mobile games that have been selling pretty well.

1206
01:13:40,939 --> 01:13:46,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Mobile has hit 8 million downloads, which is pretty amazing for a mobile game.

1207
01:13:47,084 --> 01:13:51,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And Guitar Hero 3 Mobile has made 1 million downloads.

1208
01:13:51,748 --> 01:13:52,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

1209
01:13:53,890 --> 01:14:02,597
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're interested in watching some original content from G4, or stuff that they used to have on their station, you can check out both...

1210
01:14:03,584 --> 01:14:22,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they have episodes of X-Play on there now, or Attack of the Show and stuff like that, as well as Code Monkeys, and I want to say there was a Block, I guess, which is a snowboard documentary series that never really debuted on the network.

1211
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:24,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

1212
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:30,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they just put this stuff on their own network instead of, I don't know, cops, marathons, and cheaters?

1213
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:31,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beyond me, but...

1214
01:14:33,134 --> 01:14:34,694
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura I like fire

[SPEAKER_07]: We take over the world.

1220
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:20,787
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just this really easy plot.

1221
01:15:20,827 --> 01:15:24,969
