06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
The only thing about Defend Your Castle is it gets a little bit old

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Especially if you're playing by yourself

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
But it's a neat party game

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Who doesn't love flinging people to their deaths?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm surprised DarkSakura isn't all over this game

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
She could be flinging helpless bad guys to their deaths

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Defend Your Castle, it's a WiiWare game

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I haven't played much Wii lately

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'll have to show it to you at some point, it's fun

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It's based on an old, old Flash game

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I think it's called the same thing

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Defend Your Castle, it's very similar

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
But it was much bloodier in the Flash version

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
They had to, you know, Wii-itize it or whatever you want to call it

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
They had to tone it down, but I like the style

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And if you notice also, just like that Gummy Car game or whatever they had

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
It's all done with the guy's voice

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes, I love it, his voice is great

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
That's like the music in the game, it's great

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Games I played this week, lots and lots of World of Warcraft

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because I'm kind of addicted

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
But I did check out a couple of the new arcade games on Xbox Live

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
These are demos only, so I'm really basing my opinion on demos

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Just kind of a disclaimer there

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Ace of the Galaxy, I don't know

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I played it for a little while, it was kind of interesting

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
The shooting style of it reminded me a little bit of Rez

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Where you could lock on to things and let all your bullets go off at once

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
But then I go, you know, I'm kind of playing it, and I'm just like, I just want to play Rez

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Play a game like this

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
But it was okay, but I don't know

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I can't justify spending little nickels and dimes here and there

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Games got to really wow me

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Back in the old days of Xbox Live, I was buying everything and everything

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I have so much crap on Xbox Live, I can't even stand it

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
But now a game's got to really wow me, and it just didn't have that for me

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I also played Rugu, that new puzzle-y game

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
But I didn't exactly see where the puzzle was in it

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Because it was more of a reaction game

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Now granted, I only played the demo of this

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And the game made it sound like there was a lot more to be unveiled after the demo

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
But if that's the case, then the game didn't really sell me

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Because all I really saw in the demo was

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Turn these little disks as fast as you can

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
To make sure the shapes, as they fall, fall through the right shape

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
You remember that old, old game like we had in elementary school called Perfection

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Where you had to put those little shapes in the right holes before pop

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
They all pop out, like before the board explodes

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Right, you ever played that game? Am I the one that played that?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I used to play it

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I think it was awesome, okay, thank god

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Alright, it's kind of like that

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You want to make sure you turn the disk

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So that a star shape throws to the star hole repeatedly

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Or else the galaxy blows up

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Basically

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
In a nutshell

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
But I couldn't figure out, like, how is this game gonna

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, granted as it was going along, it added more shapes

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
And it got a little harder

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And you had to, like, squash these aliens by speeding the bricks up

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
But it was still about reaction time

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I was kind of like, where is the puzzle game in this?

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
If there's a puzzle game here, the demo totally neglected to show it to me

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
You have to understand, if there's objects falling down on a screen, it's a puzzle game

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I guess, but not to me

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
So I wasn't very impressed

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Which is a darn shame

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Because the graphics and previews for the future levels made it look like more exciting things were to come

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
But I don't know

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Maybe I'll have to look it up on the internet and see if there's videos of future levels that make the game more interesting

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Because, I mean, it did hold my attention

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I was like, whee, rotating disks is fun, this game is easy, I bet it could get lots of achievement points

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
But then, like, when the demo was over, I was like, that's it?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
That's it?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
So

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Those are the two new games I played this week

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
Otherwise I've been playing more audio surf as well, that game's pretty rad, I talked about that on last week's show

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
If you missed that

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Alright, we're going to get into some gaming news here shortly

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
But I also want to introduce the one and only chat room

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Gerardimo in chat says, Rugoo equals the baby toy for adults

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Kinda

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Gerardimo also says, Rugoo equals boring, a lot

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
AJ Mix has been playing a lot of Wii in his week

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
He's been playing Dr. Mario on WiiWare, Battalion Wars Wii, Bomberman Live on Wii, and Mario Paint on the Super Nintendo

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That's old school

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Anybody checked out Dr. Mario on WiiWare yet?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
That's one of those games I keep like, I need to get it, but I have no space

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
No, this is just like, remember how Nintendo said, oh we have a hundred WiiWare games in development

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah, they're all gonna be fucking old clones of shit

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then they're gonna put Dr. Mario out there

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Just put Dr. Mario out there

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
But, hold on, to be fair, Nintendo is the master

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
No one does it better

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Case in point, Mario All-Stars on Super Nintendo

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Who didn't love that game?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Because it was like the upgraded versions of the old Mario games

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And they do a good job of it

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Maybe that was a little fanboyish statement, but they do

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Now, I have to ask about this before we get into housekeeping tonight

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And tonight at housekeeping I'm gonna address why there's been changes on Justin.tv

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
We'll get to that in a minute

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
But, first I wanna ask Loki. Loki ran through the door

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Like, during the Bobby Black Wolf call

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
He calls in right before we go live

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Because, you know, we tape live on AllGames.com every Sunday night

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And if you haven't joined us yet, you ought to

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And the show before us is the Bobby Black Wolf show

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And, you know, we've been buddy shows for years

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So, you know, this is awesome that we follow his show

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
But he always does this little tease when he calls our program right at the end of the show

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And Loki ran in right during that statement

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
But I got a call right before saying

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Rob, I'm gonna be late, there's food problems

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
So I have to ask

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
What the hell is the...

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
How did food drama make you late tonight?

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Because the pizza place I ordered these breadsticks from said

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
It would take 10 minutes

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So I went down there, 10 minutes

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
And took another 20 minutes after I got there

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Apparently it was a stupid, stupid employee night

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
You know, where they're like

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh, I forgot to put the breadsticks in

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Okay, so they put them in

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
But they only put in half my order

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Oh, I forgot to put the other half in

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So, you know, I'm just sitting there

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Nice

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And the guy, you know, up front

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Working cash register

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Had his mouth open

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Kind of drooling there

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And some guy's like

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Is my pizza ready?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I called it in, he said it's gonna be 20 minutes

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
And it's been 25

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So, can you check on it?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Well, she said that it's gonna be

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
It was, you know, gonna be about 5 minutes once you've ordered it

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
What do you mean?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
What?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
He's like

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Oh, well, they just put it in

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Can you go check on that?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
He's just like stupid and just standing there

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I love how food emergencies are a valid excuse

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio for making you personally late

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
I had plenty of time, you know, if my food

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Even with like a slight delay

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I would have still been here on time

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
But it was like fucking 40 minutes for breadsticks

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
That shit takes like 2 minutes to make

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Alright

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Let's talk about Justin TV at Housekeeping tonight

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
We've changed a little bit over on Justin TV

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Here's what happened

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
We used to run through an iSight webcam

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And my little Mac laptop

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
We used to run the webcam that way

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But the iSight got broken due to my stupidness

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And it no longer runs audio through it

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
So what happened is that this past week

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I actually got a video camera

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Because I've been wanting a video camera anyway

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So I just figured two birds with one stone

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I'm gonna get a video camera

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
We're gonna use it for Justin TV as well

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So that's what you see hooked up tonight

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
We actually have now a video camera

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Running on Justin TV

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
However, here's why the resolution is crappy

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Because for some reason

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Even though the old Justin TV broadcaster

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Used to support 640x480 on the USB capture device

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It no longer does that

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
So we have to use like 160

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But it's some really tiny tiny resolution

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So the picture's not great

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I apologize for that

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I will contact Justin TV

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
And the people who make my card

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Try to figure out what's up with that

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But then the other thing is that the audio

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
We were so close

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
We were gonna have it running through the microphones

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
But that didn't work out this week

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Because with Loki running late

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
We didn't have enough time to run all the wires

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
To the places they need to go

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
So c'est la vie

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
We're running as the audio through the actual camera tonight

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I still think it'll actually be better quality

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Than the iSight was

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Because as an actual video camera

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I think it has better quality

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
But here's the other cool thing about what we have set up

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
And what we hope to bring in the future

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Is that on Justin TV

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
All we would have to do

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Is make a little switch

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Just like this

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And you guys won't hear this on the podcast

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
But they'll see it on Justin TV

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
You can actually go to live video of gameplay

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And playing right now on Justin TV

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Is our old favorite 8-bit classic

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
The Guardian Legend

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
A little screenshot from there

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And you'll be able to see us kinda switch back and forth

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
So we can actually like

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
If we talk about games

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
And we happen to have them up

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
We can switch just that easily

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Now here's the other problem

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Is that on Justin TV

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Just then

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Their audio completely cut out

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
They only got the audio of the game

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
They didn't hear us talking over that

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
So that's the other thing we gotta fix

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
But we're working on it

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Exciting things to come on Justin TV

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
But since you guys have been crying the past few weeks

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Like where's the webcam gone

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I wanna show you we've made some progress

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
We're trying

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
We are a non-profit organization here at Orange Lounge Radio

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
K?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Alright

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Alright

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So anyhow

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, shall we?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
If there's no other housekeeping tonight

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
The only other thing I can think of is

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The old plugs for our communities

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
We love to add people on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
On LiveJournal at Orange Lounge

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Or our Facebook community

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
The O.L. Army

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Let's get to tonight's gaming news, Loki

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
There's also the Orange Lounge Wiki

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
At Wikia

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Oh that thing is awesome too

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
This is how awesome our community is

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I put out a call on the forums this week

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm like, hi

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't know anything about editing Wikis

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Like I'm not very good at it at all

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I don't know the Wiki language

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I think Wiki's a wonderful concept

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I need to take my lazy ass

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And sit it down for a while and learn Wiki

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
But the front page on the Wiki right now isn't working for me

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Like I can't find things

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Can someone please clean up the front page

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Within 24 hours

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
It looks great

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
You go there now and it actually has all these articles

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Linked from the front page

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
It's awesome

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
So if you haven't checked out the Wiki yet

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Orangeloungeradio.wikia.com

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
A true product of our community

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
They are awesome for doing that

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Alright

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Well this is a rumor that never seems to die

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
CrunchGear, a tech blog, is actually reporting

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
That an inside source at Microsoft

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Who was a former member of the company's

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
HD DVD department

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Has confirmed that the company will announce

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
That the Xbox 360 will get Blu-ray

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Before Christmas via a press release

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
That's set to go out tomorrow morning

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Around 9-10ish

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Apparently the system

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
They don't really have any info on it right now

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But it says it will cost less than an Elite system

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't know

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
This still seems far fetched

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
But I guess we'll just have to wait until tomorrow morning

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Now won't we

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Well which will be today

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
By the time this show goes out

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
So either we were really smart

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
In saying this in advance

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Or we're dumb

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
But it seems like this rumor is always going around

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
That Microsoft is going to be announcing Blu-ray

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
What makes this special

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
All I think that they're going to be doing with this

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Is just releasing another external thing

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
That's going to have

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Just like the HD DVD player

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I mean that would be the only way to do it

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
That's kind of fair to everybody

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Because if you think about it

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
If you put this in the system

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Then you're going to have problems with the drive being too slow

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Because that's what the problem is with the PS3

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
And why you have to install all this shit on there

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Is because the drive reads too slow

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
So if they had it as an external device

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That way it puts everybody on level playing field

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
If you don't want it

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
You don't have to buy it

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
If you don't want it it's not going to cost you

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
As much as the system

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I think that's what they're probably going to have to do with this

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
If they do include it inside of a 360

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I think it's going to be a dumb move

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Hopefully

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I hope they tested all this stuff

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
To make sure that the access times are the same

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Because otherwise you're going to have a lot of problems reading games

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
What is it about this particular report though

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Why I should believe it

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't know

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I think those people are just

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Because I think that instead of just saying

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh it's coming

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's saying hey there's going to be a

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Press release tomorrow

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That says duh duh duh duh

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
At this time so it's a lot easier to say

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Okay well this is going to be true or false

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Instead of speculating whether it's true or not

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Now GK128 in our chat makes an interesting observation

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
He says the new iPhone

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Is supposed to be tomorrow as well

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That's half speculation

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Half Apple fanboys

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Always speak about this stuff in advance

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
So they're probably right

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Well here's the thing

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Tomorrow is the worldwide developers conference

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
So is this Microsoft's answer to Apple

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
In a way like hey Apple's making this big unveiling

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And we're going to unveil Blu-ray in the home

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Is that what maybe gives us a little weight

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Maybe I don't know it'd just be weird

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Unless you know Microsoft

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I mean they're always kind of butting heads with Apple

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And stuff maybe they're trying to

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Get people on board with

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Their video download service and stuff like that

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I don't know

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And you put the nail on the head there

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
When they have their download service

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Alright they had the HD DVD player

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And to be honest

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I guess when I hear about Microsoft putting out a Blu-ray player

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
You remember in the old Charlie Brown

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Comics when a character would get really upset

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
There'd be a little scribble drawn over their head

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
That's what I look like

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
When I keep thinking about how my HD DVD player

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Pretty much I only have five movies

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I'll ever be able to watch on it now

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
We can still find movies all over the place though

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Usually really cheap

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
But to know that there's no more

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Ever coming out on some of these newer movies

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I might want to get

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Well we found out they were clearing out

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
We went out and bought our player

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
But I bought my player full price

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
That's why I have angry

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Angry face

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Well there are always positives and negatives

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
To adopting early

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I know I know

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It just sucks

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Keep in mind

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Blu-ray being now the

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Preferred method

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Of high definition

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Media

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm expecting now to start seeing

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
More of the

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Less expensive models coming out

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Over the next year or so

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
So you'll have an easier

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Time getting one in your hands

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
All the more reason not to buy this

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I don't know

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Well I'm not going to buy the Blu-ray player because I know

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Eventually I'm going to get a PS3

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I realize I'm the only OLR host without a PS3

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And eventually I'm going to crack it

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Well right now

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm not but Final Fantasy 13

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Is going to come out someday

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I am a Final Fantasy

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Fanboy I will be the first to admit

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
When it comes out I have no choice

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I must upgrade to PS3

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Even if the game sucks it's Final Fantasy

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I have to get it

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I did the same thing for Final Fantasy 7

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I held out on getting a Sony

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
PlayStation for the longest time until Final Fantasy 7

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Came out and then I finally caved and bought

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
One and I'm glad I did because you guys all know

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Tons and tons of classic games on the PlayStation

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I hope the PlayStation 3 has

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
A similar legacy but I don't know

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
We'll see

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Rama and Chad agrees, Rob you're not missing anything

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Hey before we get to the next story

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I missed one housekeeping thing, I'm such a jerk

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
But it's because we were

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
In a hurry tonight with trying to set up all the new

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Fancy stuff for Justin TV which didn't

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Even end up working anyway, I forgot to script out

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
What's going on for housekeeping tonight but I wanted to mention this

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Because I saw his name mentioned earlier

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
DJ, I'm sorry

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Mark Tetsuya says

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
DJ Tetsuya

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Maybe for tonight he's DJ Tetsuya

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
DJ Tetsuya said

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
That SSJ 100 Matt is to

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Thank for a large part of how the

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Wiki got reorganized so thank you SSJ 100 Matt

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I also wanted to say as far as

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
SSJ 100 Matt goes that

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The Grand Theft Auto 4

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Contest was finally finished over

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Allgames.com this week, all the votes came in

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Sadly SSJ 100

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Matt did not win the contest

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I'm sure as you read

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm sure as you read

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
They sent me the console instead because they knew

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I was the appropriate owner

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Of such a console

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
But I do have some good news

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
SSJ 100 Matt did tie for third place

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
So he does get something so that does kind of rock

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
So congratulations

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
The winner of the Grand Theft Auto 4

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Contest was the Bobby Black Wolf show

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
And their little spoof on the Cheers ad that the guy made

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And so he walked away with the

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Limited edition

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Xbox 360 and I got to admit

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It was pretty funny

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
It was definitely worthy

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
We ended up voting for the Allgames Interactive one

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Which tied for second place

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Apparently, funny enough

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Only one vote got

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
SSJ 100 Matt tied for third place

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Because Bobby's show got like four votes

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It was a runaway

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
But do you know which show voted for us?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Out of everybody?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Bobby

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Because Bobby's the only one that probably

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Understood all the in-jokes

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
That's great

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
So the winning show voted for us

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I don't know what that says

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
But something to think about

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Something to think about

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Let's move on to more news

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Something else we like to think about

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Are music based games

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Lately music based games have been all about

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Guitar Hero and Rock Band

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
A brand new Guitar Hero game is coming out

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
If you haven't heard, it's Guitar Hero Aerosmith

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith is scheduled to come out very soon

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And there are some songs

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
That have been announced for the game

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm disappointed

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Well let me tell the songs first

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I want Fog Hat edition

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Tell your frustration

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
We'll just give it a couple more years

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I'm sure that one of the billion releases will be the Fog Hat edition

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
You get to play in such places as Nipmuc High School

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Maxis, Kansas City

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
The Orpheum Theater, Halftime Show

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And Moscow

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Which is kind of cool that you get to play at places

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
You know, like

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Aerosmith kind of played in, that's cute

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Some of the Aerosmith songs you can look forward to playing

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Sweet Emotion

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' an Elevator

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Dream On, Walk This Way

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And that is the version featuring Run DMC

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
That's pretty rad

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
And there's some other bands in the game too

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Funny enough, there's not a lot of the other bands

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Well I guess in a game called Guitar Hero Aerosmith

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It shouldn't be that surprising

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It usually breaks down that there's three Aerosmith songs in the stage

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And two other band songs

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
And some of the other bands you'll see

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Cheap Trick with Dream Police

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Joan Jett, I Hate Myself for Lovin' You

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
The Clash, Complete Control

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And Run DMC with King of Rock

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
That's some of the stuff you have to look forward to

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
In Guitar Hero Aerosmith

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Which is coming out for the Playstation 3, 360

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And Playstation 2

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And if just the game wasn't enough, once you know it

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Bundles coming out as well

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So no excuses to say

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
You can't play this game unless you just don't like Guitar Hero

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Or Aerosmith

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I like Aerosmith

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Or if you're not a consumer whore and realize

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Hey guess what?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
You can just wait a few more months and get an actual sequel to the game

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh Loki

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Achievements

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
A thousand points worth

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I'm not fucking playing that

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I do like Aerosmith though

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
But I will

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I don't know

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Not buying a game just with Aerosmith

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Cause that's almost like buying an album

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I don't wanna buy albums anymore

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
That's a lot of album though

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
That's like 15 songs

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Well I guess that's a normal album, nevermind

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
See what they're doing?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Now we're charging you $50 for an album

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
They will never know what's actually happening

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You don't get to actually play your album

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Then again it's not real guitar

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I'm not making a good case here

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Help Chat Room

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Guitar Hero Fans

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Ready? Go!

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
The next story has to do with something that rather excites me

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
One of my favorite game series ever

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
And I'm not saying Metal Slug

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
But it's Samurai Showdown

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
They actually said

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Well from the ESRB

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
That Xbox Live Arcade

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Would be getting Samurai Showdown 2

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
And also now they're saying they should be getting Samurai Showdown

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I suppose they mean they're getting them separately

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
But

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
There's no news beyond what

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
There's been on the ESRB

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
So we can hope

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
That they'll be all jazzed up and pretty

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
Are we gonna get like all the Samurai Showdown games?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Cause that's kind of a lot

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
What's so special about 5?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
5 is the last cartridge that was released

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
On the Neo Geo cartridge system

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
And I've never played it

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
And I want it

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
I want Samurai Showdown HD Remix

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
You can do Samurai Showdown 5 HD Remix

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I want Samurai Showdown 2 though

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Most of all cause that one was like the best

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Huh

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
They had caffeine nicotine

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Nice

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Going back to the question that we asked earlier

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Let's see, Kitsune says

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I'm not too thrilled about the new Guitar Hero

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
AJ Mix says it's not Guitar Hero Blink 182

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Kitsune follows up and says

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I think my husband might get it for the 360

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Robert M says

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I still can't find many of the Aerosmith songs on iTunes

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Gerardo says

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, why?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Because Guitar Hero makes it money

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Let's see, GS68 is hoping for

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Guitar Hero Loki Fusion

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I don't know about that one

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Well here's the thing

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Activision is starting to get like

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Before people were saying, oh you're really hoarding this franchise

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Well now they're just

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Not even trying to pretend that they're not

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
They are just coming out with

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Oh by the way, hey if you don't want this

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Guitar Hero game, don't worry cause there's like four

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Other ones coming out within the foreseeable future

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Last couple comments

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
GK128 says Guitar Hero

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Insert band name here will always be a rental

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Unless it's something badass like Pixies or

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Dinosaur Jr. which you must be fanboys of

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Frisbee says

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Make Aerosmith a download pack

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And AZHP says

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
It'll only be worth it if you actually like Aerosmith

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Aerosmith's kinda cool though

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I think what I'm talking about is

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Rockband has it figured out with the download packs

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Problem they're gonna run into with that though

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Is what they do for Rockband 2

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Because now you have like

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Rockband with all these songs

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And you can't

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Here, make all the old songs that you've already downloaded compatible

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Hopefully they do

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Just like they did with EDR

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And that's how they could sell more Guitar Hero Aerosmiths

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Is by saying, okay well all those download songs

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
That you had will be compatible with this game

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Or you can download more

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
And have them compatible with both games

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
That would be smart

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Which is why they're not gonna do it

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Nintendo Maniac 64 says

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
This is what we need, Guitar Hero F-Zero

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I'm not sure how that would work

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
But it sounds good in theory

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
It would be just like

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
You know, the Rockband commercial where they're

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
On top of the bus, you know, playing their music

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
But on top of an F-Zero

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
That's the intro to the game, isn't it?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
What's that? That's the intro to the game

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I know, I know

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But still, that would be Guitar Hero F-Zero

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
It's playing music really fast

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
On a really, really, really fast car

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Flying through the air

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Or maybe instead of that normal note track you have

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
You're actually on a car that's racing down

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
One of those super fast F-Zero tracks

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Doing loops and stuff

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And you have to read the notes off that

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
That'd be kind of fun

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
You know what would be cool?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Is to actually combine

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
The play levels for frequency

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
With Rockband

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Wouldn't that be fun?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
And so

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
As you play through it, you twist up

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
The path that they take and

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Form new designs and

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Get new effects that way

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Or if you really want an obscure reference

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
You can just make a Guitar Hero

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Action game that's based off of

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Macross 7

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah, that would be great!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
You get more points if you scream out

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Listen to my song, dammit

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
For those of us who are familiar

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
With Macross 7

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
All the mechs were based around music

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Rob, one of the biggest

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Points in Macross was that music

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Had a lot of power, which was how

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
In the very first series, spoiler!

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You know, 20 years later

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
How in the first series they defeated the enemies

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
That came by was because of stupid butt-head

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Mid-may

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And so Macross 7 is sort of a big play-off

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Of the whole music is power thing

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I gotta tell you though

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Going back to F-Zero for a minute

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I wanted to actually put in F-Zero GX

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And play it a little bit because it's still one of my favorite racers

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And I think I said this over on Bobby's show

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
When we were doing the tees tonight

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
There aren't a lot of racing games I really like outside

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Of F-Zero because F-Zero is fast

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And it's horrifically simple

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Like, that's what I like in a racing game

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I like Burnout because Burnout is fast too

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
And it has explosions

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
There's not a lot of racing games I really, really love

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
If they made a Burnout arcade game that would be pretty awesome

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That would be pretty awesome

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Alright, let's move on with more news

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
So, of course

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Me being a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Was a little bit disappointed to hear

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
That the Grand Theft Auto

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Download content that's been promised for me

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Has been delayed to Fiscal Quarter 1 2009

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
What's that mean?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Well, that means

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
That it's due between November 1, 2008

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And January 31, 2009

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Which when you look at it

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It's not really that bad anyways

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
But hey, still though

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I wish it was out a little bit sooner

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Because, you know

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Because sooner is better!

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Exactly! And because you know

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I'm almost done with the game

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I need more achievements

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And also I need more stuff to do

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I hope they add tanks

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
What about multiplayer?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Multiplayer is fun

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Having some lag issues

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Well, not really lag issues

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
But like disconnect issues

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
But still love it

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Love the multiplayer

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
We want to do instead of just killing each other

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
We want to do like a team of four

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And go against another team of four

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
You know, because our office would kick ass

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But so far it has

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Cock blocked this from doing such

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
It's like, nope, sorry

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You can't connect to anything

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Fuck you, bye

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I don't know

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
That's a really in depth message

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Yeah, hey

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I was surprised to see that pop up too

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
But you know, that's just how they roll

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
How they roll

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Yeah, it's alright though

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Because if the download content comes out later

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That gives me time to play Saints Row 2

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
In the middle, and oh god I want that game too

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
You know, I don't think Saints Row 2

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Came up on our show roll at all tonight

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Maybe it's because we talked a little bit about the delay last week

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
But I guess a new trailer came out this week

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
And it caused somebody, and I apologize I'm not crediting this

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
But I don't have our forums up right now

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Somebody went to the forums and actually posted

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Dude, this looks like Loki the game

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I didn't watch the new trailer

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
What's so great about it?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
What they were doing, the whole trailer was comparing

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 with Saints Row 2

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And mainly it was a trailer highlighting

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
The side missions you can do in the game

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Because the side stuff you can do in Grand Theft Auto 4

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
You know, they have like

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Bowling and playing pool and darts

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
And stuff like that

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Well, they were showing

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Oh hey, you can go and spray sewage

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
On people, you know

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Or you can do insurance fraud

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
With co-op and throw people in front of trains

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Or you can streak through the neighborhood

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Or you can rob stores

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And do all sorts of crazy stuff like that

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Hey, you know what

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Me being a fan of both games

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Both are great in their own aspects

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
They're just different

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It's like Star Wars and Spaceballs

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
So competition is healthy

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Exactly, you know, I'm glad to see

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Because a lot of the stuff that came from Saints Row

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Ended up making it into

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
The whole

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Their navigation systems

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Pretty much the same as Saints Row

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Using the cell phone for all the cheats

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And stuff like that

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
A lot from Saints Row

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Just, you know, the multiplayer

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Probably pushed them a little bit more

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
To do multiplayer on the platform, which is good

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
So, you know,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Competition is good, I like to see that

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And also because Grand Theft Auto came out

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
That pushed Saints Row to add flying vehicles

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
And stuff like that, so

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I don't care, they're both awesome

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
You don't have to pick one

34:41.000 --> 35:09.000
Alright, if you want to check out the Saints Row 2 trailer

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
11 million copies sold to retailers

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So yes, that means about 2.5 million

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Are sitting on store shelves right now

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Waiting to be scooped up through the holiday season

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
That was all reported in Take 2's

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Second Quarter Financials reported earlier this week

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
So, not too shabby

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
11 million units sold to retailers

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Take 2

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Very happy campers right now

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Extremely happy campers

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I wish I could sell 11 million

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Units of one of my dream games

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
I'd be rich, I'd never have to work again

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Although we all know, I'm telling you, if Laser Cats the game came out

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
That's like 25 million

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
25 billion

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Units

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I don't care, there's not that many people in the world

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But everybody would buy like 5 copies because it would be that awesome

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Don't you think?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I smell another ET

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Uh oh

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
You know, speaking of ET

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
This is going to sound so random

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
But I don't care, I'm in a mood tonight

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I was on Wikipedia this week

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Reading about old school Atari games

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Like ET and Pac-Man

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And like why they failed

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And it was fascinating

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I don't know, just kind of reading up on my video game history

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I think it's good to brush up on your video game history once in a while

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Because you played ET and you're like

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
How does anything like the movie?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I don't get this

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I didn't get it when I was 5

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I don't get it now

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Forget it

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Can I do my story?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Um, more Xbox Live

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Arcade news is

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Uh, Commando 3

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
That's Wolf of the Battlefield

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Is going to be on

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Xbox Live Arcade as of I believe next Wednesday

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And will be 800 points

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And it also has an

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Invite to Super Street Fighter 2

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Turbo HD Remix beta

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
So

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
So I wonder how many percentage of the purchasers

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Of Commando 3 are actually trying to get the beta

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Like what happened with

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Crackdown and the Halo 3 beta

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Crackdown was pretty awesome

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
But Crackdown was a pretty good game

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
So hopefully Commando 3 is a pretty good game as well

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
That would make it very worth it

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
But I'm not a big fan of all these 800

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Price points lately

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Whatever happened to the $5 games?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
When was the last time we got a $5 game?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Oh wait, we had like Warlords and stuff

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I guess that wasn't really worth it though

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Well now that Penny Arcade came out for 1600 points

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Everyone's like, Hey!

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
That game sells really well, it's $20

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Do anybody think there's a reason?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Ah forget it

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
They won't put 2 and 2 together

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Well we'll see

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
If you don't want to download that

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
There are some other things you can download

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Especially if you own Guitar Hero 3

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
We're going to have some new Motorhead

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Tracks coming out

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It's going to be part of

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
A series of tracks that they're going to have

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Coming out in June

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
So the Motorhead Track Pack

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Which will be available June 5th

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I guess that's already come out then

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Includes, We Are The Road Crew

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Stay Clean and of course

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Motorhead

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And is available for 500 Microsoft points

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Or $6.25

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
In real money

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
The track that's coming out next week

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Which is the Isle of Wight

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
That is coming out June 12th

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
The price has been unconfirmed

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
But it's probably going to be also 500 Microsoft points

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Includes, Shoot The Runner by

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Cosbian

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I Predict The Riot by Kaiser Chiefs

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And Problems by the Sex Pistols

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
So that's pretty awesome

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Alright

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Well also speaking of ever expanding

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Games, Soul Calibur 4

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
The roster of players just keeps

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Growing and growing

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
And interestingly enough

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
When we got Darth Vader and Yoda

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Announced for Soul Calibur 4

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
People were kind of like, oh haha that's cute

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
We're going to have these Star Wars characters

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
In the game that's going to be

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Kind of random

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
But here's the weird thing

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Another Star Wars character

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Has been added to the Soul Calibur 4

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Roster

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So this is suddenly starting to feel like Star Wars

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Versus Soul Calibur or something weird

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Which I would not disapprove of

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I guess that's true

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
It's kind of neat in a weird way

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
It's just weird

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I'll say it again

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
After I've played the game, we'll see

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
But here's the deal

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
The Secret Apprentice

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Is going to be in both versions of

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Soul Calibur 4

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Darth Vader is only going to be in the PS3

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
However the Secret Apprentice

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Now the Secret Apprentice comes from

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Star Wars The Force Unleashed

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
This guy is actually going to be

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
In Soul Calibur 4

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
So check that out

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
When that game comes out a little later this year

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
You know they need to put Bob Barker

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Into a fighting game

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Uh huh

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Bob Barker needs to be in a fighting game

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I mean that would be pretty badass

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Immortalize him, put him in another Soul Calibur game

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Soul Calibur versus Happy Gilmore

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I don't know about that

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
No, just like TV show hosts

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Just throw them in, random, it doesn't have to make any sense

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
The Star Wars stuff doesn't make any sense

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Just throw it in

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
So if it's TV show hosts, can he like beat up Rosie O'Donnell

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And Barbara Walters

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Yeah sure, anything can happen

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Bob Barker, don't you know that he's held together by Clay

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
And that formula from Death Becomes Her

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Celebrity Death Match

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
That already was a game, wasn't it?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Speaking of characters held together by Clay

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I know, really

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Maybe they just need Celebrity Death Match 2

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
That would be great

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
But you know what they should have if they did something like that

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Is have download characters

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
And have it, you know, where you could

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Customize, you know

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
They have like, you know, like they do in the wrestling games

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
So you can make different, you know

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
People, you know, mimic them

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
In wrestling games, you should have something like that

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Like Celebrity Death Match

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Could be, make your own celebrity

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
See what they need to do, they need to have more games

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I'm a celebrity, dammit

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I want to put myself in the game

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm an internet celebrity, I have a pen that says so

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
What they need to do is have more games that have that kind of same humor

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
As like Kung Fu Hustle, kind of like God Hand

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Where it's just ridiculous

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
And more of like an anime style, you know

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That was more of a brawling game

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
But, you know, more of like a fighting game

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
With some like funny characters that are just really exaggerated

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And stuff like that

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur gets a lot of reaction from chat

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Let's check this out, Gerardo says

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Star Wars GTFO of my Soul Calibur

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Go get your own fighting game

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
No, they already did that

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And that didn't turn out too well either

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
The Terrace

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Then let Namco do it

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Well, actually though, they're going to be doing something

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
With the Force Unleashed on the Wii

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Is going to have like a fighting game portion of it

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Why don't they just put a Star Wars game

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That's based off the Soul Calibur engine

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
GS68 says this is Soul Calibur

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Not fucking Star Wars Calibur

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Cheeseburger says Chuck Norris in Soul Calibur

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Will roundhouse kick everyone

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I dig that, he doesn't have a sword

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
He just has his roundhouse kicks

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Why not, GS68 says

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Luckily if anyone picks a Star Wars character

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I'll pick Ivy and suffocate them to death

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Sounds like fun

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I'd be like Boob Smash

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Exactly, chat.ornisontraday.com

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Is it my turn now, is it, is it, is it?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It is

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Yay, um, well

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I'm sure people who've listened to this show

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
For quite a while now know that I have an interest in law

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I love

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
What

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
But you are the law

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Rob

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
What?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
You know, I think that's an unhealthy obsession

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
That you have there with Tekken

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I was just waiting for her to go

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I am the law

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I do have a Judge Dredd pinball machine

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
In my house, thank you very much

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
But um

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
One of the former Supreme Court judges

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Sandra Day O'Connor

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Is wanting to make a game

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
That teaches court lessons

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
It's called Our Courts

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
It's a free game for kids between 12 and 15

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And it basically

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Lets you learn how

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Courtrooms work, what the system is like

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And learn

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
You know, actual legal issues

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
When I was in school

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
We used to do

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Court simulations

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Using modern day

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I guess

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
The modern day courtroom system

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
To judge

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Historical acts, like I got to be Marie Antoinette

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
So I had to be really

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Awesome

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Did they behead you?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
First and foremost

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Don't get me started on the French Revolution

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Because

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
No one wants to hear about that

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Keep in mind

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm a history buff

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I love my history

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Look, here, I'll retard the conversation

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
A little bit

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
You know what we did in our school to practice courtroom?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
What?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
We watched Nickelodeon Kids Court hosted by Paul Provenza

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
That's what we did

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Oh

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
The other thing that we also did at my school

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Was model United Nations

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And I got to be on the Security Council my senior year

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
And that was freaking badass

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Because I had to tell both China and the US to shut up

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
What country did you represent?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Hungary

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It was great

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Hungary was on the Security Council that year

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Considering that your life has evolved into

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
A food podcast

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
That sometimes talks about video games

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
That's really funny that you represented

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Hungary

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Oh come on

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Home of the Habsburgs

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Anyway

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You can't write this shit you guys

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It's all true

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
So anyway

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
It's basically

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
An educational game

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Supposed to be put out so that children

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Have a better understanding of how

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
The government works without having to

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
You know see the

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Sort of farcical side of

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Law enforcement with Grand Theft Auto

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And those types of things

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
You know to actually see

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Where your duties come in

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I guess as far as

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Participating in the system

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I think it's a neat idea

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
And honestly it's something that I myself

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Look into because I have

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
An interest in it

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I've taken a number of law classes

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Through my various majors

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Didn't you say it was only for kids 12-15?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It's targeted

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
It's actually to be

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Offered free to children

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
12-15 years old

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I know some people 25 years old that could benefit

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
From that game

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I want to give it a try

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
She's actually quoted saying

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It will allow students to engage in

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Real legal issues

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And it gives an example of

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
A debate by someone

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Wearing a controversial t-shirt

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
So I guess freedom of speech versus

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
You know how

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Stupidly offended everybody in this

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Country gets over people

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Sneezing the wrong way

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Sorry

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Robert M. makes the mandatory Phoenix Wright reference

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
By saying hold it

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Yes hold it

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Anyways

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
So

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
This is kind of interesting

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
There's been a couple stories

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
That have come out recently about

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Different gaming surveys

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
And oh my god what it means and stuff like that

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Yeah I have never seen anything about this

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And this just totally slipped under the radar

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
For everybody I think

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Anyways

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
There was a survey that went out to

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Select people in the

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Microsoft game studio

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
And it was a survey

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Talking about different

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Characters and what you thought about them

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And stuff like that

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Now the survey was for

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
What they describe basically

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Here's their description of it

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
This game will be a game creator

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
And will provide a simple way to make

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Your own games on the Xbox

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Using just the Xbox controller

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
You can build worlds, populate

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Them with characters and give the characters

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Unique behaviors

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
You can easily build racing games

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Platformers and adventure games without

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Touching a keyboard or leaving your couch

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
So this is either XNA for dummies

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Or little big planet thing

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Exactly

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Well what this is

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Through the process of

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Deduction I should say

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
It's a game called

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Or not even really a game

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
A programming language called Boku

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And Boku which you'll find out

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
There actually are stories out there on the internet

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I'm not exactly breaking any news here

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Boku is a programming

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Environment for children that runs on

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Windows and the Xbox 360

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
And basically what makes it

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Kind of different is it

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Uses basically

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Symbols like you have different objects

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
For each symbol and you have

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Kind of actions

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
And then other objects

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
So you kind of tie them all together without any programming language

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So say you have a creature that looks like

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Pac-Man or something like that

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
The Pac-Man character

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Eat dots

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
And so that character will now seek out

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
The dots and try to eat them or something like that

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
It's basically simple like that

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
But here's what I see

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Happening with this

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Sure they can make it just for children

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
But why not expand it to be a little bit more

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Full featured and make it something that

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Can compete with say

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
XNA, well not even really compete with

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
But compete along with

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I was going to say you don't want to compete against yourself

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
With XNA or even say

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Like a little big planet

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
There's a bunch of screenshots of

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You know characters and stuff that they had out there

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
And there's some other like

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Links and stories and stuff showing

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
The programming environment

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
And the characters look interesting

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
It's like everything from Pokemon looking characters

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
To I don't know

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Just some strange looking shit

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
One of those things there looks like a pregnant Pac-Man ghost

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I don't know what that is

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Can you link that picture to our chat?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Looks like a pregnant Pac-Man ghost

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
But I just think it's really interesting

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Now Dr. Seuss says

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
It sounds neat I wish there was a PC version

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
But this is something being developed across both platforms

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
It is going to be Windows and

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
For the 360

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
No idea though when it's going to be released

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Or anything of that sense

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
But it looks like they're still working on it

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
If they're sending out surveys about this thing

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Why has this only been a blip on the gaming radar?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I don't know

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Do people think there's not going to be interest in this?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Or what is it?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
The stuff that was covered here wasn't really in

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
It might have been just under the radar

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Because there's no gaming related stuff

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Kind of covered where this stuff was

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It was basically at

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
The Microsoft Research Tech Fest

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
This came out in 2007

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
The Tech Fest 2007

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
So March of last year

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Is when this

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Originally was shown

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
And they only had it demoing

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
It was covered by WIRED

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
They actually had a

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Little piece on it

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But that's about it

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I don't know

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
It's very very interesting

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I don't know

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It could be something that's coming soon

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Something maybe they'll show at E3

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
But if they are working on it

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
I think it could be pretty big

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Because a lot of this stuff

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
The whole game 3.0 crap that they're trying to push

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Where it's all user created content

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Why not make it like a game creator?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
What, click and play?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
This old Maxis PC

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Game making software is actually pretty cool

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Vaguely, I actually do remember that

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
It was pretty cool, but make something like that

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Maybe like LittleBigPlanet almost

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
But you can make your own games

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Using this software and then distribute them

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
To your friends or post them on

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Some sort of integrated message board

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Or something like that

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
They're going to do the same thing with Blastworks

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Which is coming out this week

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
That game is going to be pretty awesome

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
This is the way

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Things are going

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I'll link that picture in chat

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
While you're waiting for more

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Information on Boku

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
You can get some games a little bit sooner

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Across the world, we like to cover release dates

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We're going to start off in Japan tonight

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Not a lot sadly coming out on the Xbox 360

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
This week, but if we look at the Playstation 3

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Hello, Metal Gear Solid 4

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Guns of the Patriots

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It's this week in Japan, June 12

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Is when you can get that

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
The Japanese language version

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
You can get over there, there's a premium pack

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
A special edition

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
You know all the goodies

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Because people in Japan love their limited edition stuff

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
So that is all coming out for Metal Gear Solid 4

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
And honestly because of it

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
There's not a lot out there

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
That really wants to compete with it this week

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Nintendo Wii has nothing coming out

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Playstation 2 has nothing coming out

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Now the Nintendo DS has a little bit

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Coming out, but not a lot

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
A game called Breath

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Oua Akaneiro is coming out on June 12th

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
As well as another Pachinko game

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
That has to do with Neon Genesis Evangelion

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Is coming out

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Just because we didn't have enough Evangelion

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Games on the DS

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
But I'm looking at what this Breath game is all about

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And trying to figure out what this is

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
It looks like an adventure game

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I'm trying to figure out if it's another dating sim

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Because it definitely looks like you have

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Cute girls on the top screen

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And text on the bottom screen

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
That's usually a good sign of a dating sim

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
And also coming out in Japan

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Othello de Othello DS

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Which I'm assuming is just the classic game

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
You might know as Reversi

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Yeah, it is

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Othello

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
The old school game

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And also coming out on the Nintendo DS

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Sekai wa Atashi de Mowateru

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Is coming out

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Which is a

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
RPG game

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
From Global A Entertainment

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
And quickly glancing to see

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
If there's anything on the PSP of note

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Or if Metal Gear is just dominating

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
The Sony universe this week

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Medical 91 for portable

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Is listed for the Sony PSP

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
That is a game

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
It's not Trauma Center, I'll tell you that

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
It's an adventure game

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
There's no screenshots, I couldn't tell you more about that

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
But looks like there's one lone game

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
On the PSP this week, but otherwise

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Not a lot wanting to compete with Metal Gear Solid 4

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
This week over in Japan

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Well we do have our UK releases

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
If anyone is interested

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
We have on the 12th

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Metal Gear Solid Online and

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Don King presents Prize Fighter

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Whatever, that's on the 13th

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
More on the 13th is Doodle Hex

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
On DS

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Emergency Heroes, Family Ski

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Okami on Wii

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Pro Cycling Manager 2008

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Alright

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
The US, there's actually

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Quite a bit coming out

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Of course this week, you know, Metal Gear Solid 4

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
That's obviously going to be the biggest one

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
On PS3

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Also coming out, NASCAR 09

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
On PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
And the Xbox 360

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
We've got

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Backyard Baseball 09

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
On PlayStation 2 and the Wii

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
8 Hunter Detective Chronicles

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
On the DS

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Looney Tunes Cartoon Conductor

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
That's the one if you may remember

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
That's a rip-off of

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Elite Beat Agents

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
That will be coming out on the DS

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
My Fashion Studio, also on the DS

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
On PlayStation 3 and

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Xbox 360

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
And let's see here, Don King presents

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Prize Fighter

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
360

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
And finally, Blastworks

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Build, Trade, and Destroy on the Wii

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
If you own a Wii, you must buy this game

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm telling you right now, buy this fucking game

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Huh

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It's an awesome shooter game

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Everything's customizable in it

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
You can build your own levels

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm thinking we should run a contest based on it

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
But, you know

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know, it looks awesome

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I plan on picking it up when it comes out

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Alright

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Tomiki Fighters, you mean?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Well yes, it's basic, well it's not exactly

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Tomiki Fighters, they do have Tomiki Fighters

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
in there as an unlockable game

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
But it is completely rebuilt

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And it's a lot more than just

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Tomiki Fighters, it's not just a rip-off

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
It's got a lot of stuff to offer

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
So, definitely check it out

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Did the company pay you to plug them?

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
No, the company does not pay me to plug it

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I think it looks really good

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
And they're gonna have this whole Blastworks Depot

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
thing where you can upload and download objects

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
created by other people

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
For example, you can take this and make your own

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Star Fox game

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
You can take this and make another Guardian Legends game

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
if you wanted to

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Stuff like that

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I think it has a lot of

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Especially, everybody's into the whole customizing stuff

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Making custom levels for Smash Brothers

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
That was pretty simple

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Look at this, this thing, people should run with this

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Alright

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Well, hey, if you want to get something a little sooner

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
as in right now, the PlayStation Network

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
was created on Thursday and they added quite a bit

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
of new things

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
They added something called Core, which we're gonna talk a little more about in Part B

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
But they also added some new downloadable games

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Wolf of the Battlefield, Commando 3

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
came out this week, $10

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
As well as Nova Strike

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Some new things came out for Guitar Hero 3

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
including the new God of War song

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
we talked about a few weeks ago

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It did finally come out this week

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Some new demos for you guys, including Civilization Revolution

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Battlefield Bad Company MP

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
and NASCAR 09

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
for some varying games

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Hail to the Chimp

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
which I'm sure you're all downloading right now

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Lego Indiana Jones, slightly cooler

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
and very cool, Resident Evil 5

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
The trailer is up for that

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
if you're interested in checking that out

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Also some new themes, a retro theme

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
has come out for the PlayStation 3

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I'm not sure what type of retro that is

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
How retro could that be?

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Maybe PS1 graphics

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
It's all Betamax

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
That should be kind of rad

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It comes up with the beta logo

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and then a bunch of

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo 2

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
stuff in the PC

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
PlayStation Store

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
TV spots, wallpaper

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
and the whole freaking game

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
itself, if you want that

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
So check that out, PlayStation Network

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
updates this week

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Another thing that's been updated

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
is Sega's calendar

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
It looks like Sonic Unleashed

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
is going to be out in November

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
but other things people might have been

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
waiting on like Aliens

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Colonial Marines

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
and Empire Total War

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
are both going to be out in 2009

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
But the Beijing

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Olympics game is going to be out on the 27th

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
of June and on August 27th

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
is a

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
game called Space Siege which is by

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
GasPowered Games

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Other things that are set to be out

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
is the Golden Axe

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I guess a revamp

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
of it, Sonic Chronicles Bioware

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Role Playing Game

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and Picto Image DS

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
also

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
a sequel to

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Yakuza

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I hate to say this because I know Sega

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
is near and dear to your heart and I don't know how you feel

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
about this series but Golden Axe

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
was something that was way cooler when I was a kid

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
I love Golden Axe

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I love Golden Axe the Duel a whole lot too

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I went and I downloaded

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
the Genesis version on Virtual Console

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
and I was just kind of like

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
oh my god this game is like repetitive and boring

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
it was so much better when I was a kid

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I don't know what it is

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
but somehow the charm, the magic was lost

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
maybe it was because I wasn't playing with friends

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
at a pizza joint

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
you know what I mean? Games like that are always much funner with friends

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
because couldn't you like hit each other in that game

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
like if you're on that little purple bird

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
looking thing you could hit your friends over

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
that was always pretty rad

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
yeah and that purple bird thing would be something that you're riding

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
like in

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Golden Axe Beast Rider

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
well I do still think

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
you know what I always loved about Golden Axe

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I would check out a revamped version of it

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
because you know what I always loved about Golden Axe

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
was the ending, wasn't the ending

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
the best thing ever in Golden Axe

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
where they actually came out of the arcade game

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
spoilers, sorry

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
I was gonna say

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
one of the games she forgot mentioning there

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
of course

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
we're gonna like this game on the Wii

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
uh

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Someday Amigo, that's out this summer

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
nice

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
but only if there's like fake maracas

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I love maracas

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
you know someone's gonna release

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
a maracas attachment

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
they will, they've talked about the little

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
plastic sleeves and silly things

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
and besides, if they don't

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
what a difference duct tape

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
and maracas can make

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
all you need to do is order more free

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
condoms for your controller

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
seriously, we should do

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
okay, you know what we should do?

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
the Orange Jones Radio edition maracas

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I love it

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
and we make them out of paper mache

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
like you used to do in kindergarten

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
we'll get all the supplies at Michael's

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
we will, you can actually just buy gourds

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
and duct tape a gourd to it, that'd be fantastic

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
if you don't live

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Michael's is all across the US, right?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I think so

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
it's a craft store, if you live abroad

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
even though you've visited a Michael's

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
let me just put it that way

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
it's a great little craft store

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
anyway, forget it

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
dude, okay, I've been spending so much time

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
with stuff I have to get at Michael's

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
that, okay

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I'm gonna make maracas

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
just you watch, I'll make them

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
put it on YouTube and all that stuff

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
we have a YouTube channel we don't use for anything

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
your hands can be, right?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
yeah, I've actually thought about buying

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
a tub of the fondant there one time

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
cause that stuff tastes like those animal cookies

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
but it's really not good for you

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
alright, forget it, move on, move on

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
so something that has nothing to do

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
with Michael's

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
unfortunately

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
it's, you know, sad to see

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
that Itagagi has

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
left Tecmo

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
so you're not gonna see

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
him helming anymore Ninja Gaiden

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
or Dead or Alive games

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
at least not with Team Ninja

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I don't know why he left

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
but I guess just

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
you know

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
emotional distress

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I guess

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
worsening personal relationships

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and work environment

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
if I remember right, wasn't there something about unpaid overtime

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
too, or something that factored into it?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I'm sure there is

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
basically he's a very disgruntled employee right now

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
he's a rock star, he can't be like, you know, tied down

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
with a job and stuff, he has to be trashing hotel rooms

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Itagaki is a fucking rock star

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
you don't see a lot of

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
gaming rock stars

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Itagaki is a rock star

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
they need him to hang out with

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
say the guy that does the

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Castlevania games

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
just like make this really kick ass

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
guitar wolf

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
programming team that just

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
fucking says, they come in

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
they kick over the microphone and they're like fuck this

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
you're buying our fucking game and everyone's like

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
hell yeah I am!

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
so that's how they need to do it

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
just like scare the crap

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
out of the press, that'd be awesome

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
just come in, set something on fire

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
throw it into the crowd

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
just like, that's how you

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
sell your game

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
women coming out and wearing

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
nothing but you know

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
skippy ass clothing, they don't fucking

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
care if it's offensive, they're just like

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
whatever man, just some fabric

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
they bought at Michael's, that's all

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
whip cream, that's it

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
just whip cream

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
barbecue condiments

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Itagaki is a rock star

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
so he'll go on to doing something

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I'm sure

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
just hopefully he doesn't decide to go

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
develop playground equipment

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
like a certain other people

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
unless the playground equipment

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
electrocutes children

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
that I can see

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and has fake boobs that are on it

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
yeah yeah

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
that's what he does in the middle of the presentation

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
just a motorboat right there

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
busts out with that

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
buy our game

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
how come you never see someone like him

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
busted for destroying hotel rooms?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
that's what I want to know

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
just wait for this year's E3

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
you know, that could be the rock band sequel

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
no, keep in mind

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
instead of

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I don't know

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
but keep in mind

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
you have rock band the RPG

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
where you know, you go and you trash

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
hotel rooms and have groupies

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and you know, that type of thing

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
wouldn't that be awesome?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
how about video game rock band or something

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
because you could play as Itagaki

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
alright, maybe not

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
you know, Itagaki's got his own thing going on

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
he's cool

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
he wants to have champagne

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and only green M&M's

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
if anyone gets that reference

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
that's awesome

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
by the way, if you get that reference

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
you're awesome

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
because that's a true rock star right there

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
somebody who fucking demands

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
only green M&M's

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
just to see if someone will do it

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
more points to somebody who gets that joke

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
alright, anyhow

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
what?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Africa

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
onto things less cool

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
actually, I take that back

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
because this game was kind of like the running joke

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
of E3 a couple years ago

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
because they didn't tell us anything about the game

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
there was nothing told about the game

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
well guess what, finally

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
finally with this game just around the corner

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
for release in Japan very soon

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
some details have come out about the game

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Africa, you're going to be a photo journalist

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
and you can take pictures on foot

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
in a car or by air balloon

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
which is kind of rad, because you don't see hot air balloons

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
make many gaming appearances

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
and you can unlock

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
non-CG pictures

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
and actual research footage

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
of animals as you encounter animals

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
in-game

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and it comes out on August 28th

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
you build up this animal library

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
well great, I would like to know as much as possible

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
about the things I'm running over in my jeep

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I don't think

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
you can do that in the game

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
dammit

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
so basically it's Africa Snap

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
but it doesn't sound like it's on a track

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
it sounds kind of a whole lot cooler

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
it's going to be a trailer for the game

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and with the graphics and all

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I've got to say, it does look like

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
potentially, it's going to be a very kick-ass

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I don't even know if you really call it a game

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
like a kick-ass thing

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
it looks really neat

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I've got to say

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
so maybe we'll all end up eating crow

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
about making fun of this game at E3

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
a few years ago

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
but it actually looks kind of neat

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
so I want to check this out

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
right, and then Aya Judgment is going to be awesome too

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
oh wait, no, I mean you really got to check out the preview

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
it kind of, like the graphics look gorgeous

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
absolutely gorgeous

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
yeah, they do look gorgeous

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
great, what does it say about the gameplay?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
nothing, exactly, and the gameplay could suck

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and this game could still suck

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
but I'm just saying, there's hope

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
there is hope, before we had no hope

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Africa was just the running joke

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
but now that we're finding out a little bit about it

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
it sounds interesting

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
exactly, just like Frisbee says in the chatroom

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Africa equals Endless Ocean

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
yes, pretty much

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
and how did Endless Ocean do?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
not very well, how did

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
there was another Safari game that was on the Wii

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
that sucked

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
that's the only Safari game that did any

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
and this is not even really a Safari game

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
but a similar game that did

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
you know, really well was Pokemon Snap

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I'm going to guess that's because it had Pokemon in it

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
have we ever had like a really kick-ass

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Safari game, like Jumbo Safari

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
of course, but

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
that's just an arcade game, people like that game

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
eat moves and you're going really fast

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and you're catching animals

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and you can throw harpoons

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
harpoons make every game better

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
add that to the list of things

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
that make games better

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
1 Dragonforce, 2 harpoons

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
3 Pokemon

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
who didn't love Scorpion in the first Mortal Kombat

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Pokemon does not make things better

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
stop that

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
that is wrong

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Pokemon has flavor

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
eating Pokemon would make a game better

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
number 1 thing that makes games better

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Dragonforce

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
by the way, they have a new album coming out

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
do what?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
number 2, things that make games better

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
harpoons

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
3, the other things that make games better

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
fire, shooting hookers

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
we need to get them on the show promoting their album

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I will send them an email

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
right after the show, I will

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
alright

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
however we have some other business to take care of

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
real quick

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Tigerclaw says in chat

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
the real question is

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
will Africa show animals doing it?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
yes!

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
since it's supposed to stimulate

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
stimulate the wildlife

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
well we know where my brain is

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
since it's supposed to simulate

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
wildlife, what do wildlife often do?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Frisbee says

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Africa, rated M for strong sexual content

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
2 things, 1, animals fuck

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
2, monkeys throw poo

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
the end

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
did you see that, someone says

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and it had the pester ball

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
did you see that

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
there's a little robotic camera

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
that you can drive around

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and take pictures with

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
in Africa?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
yeah, it looked like a Mars lander

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I can't wait to annoy things with that

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
that's it

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Darktessia's got it

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
instead of doing Africa, they should do

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Jurassic Park

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
with a cam

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
and you could drop lawyers in there

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
and watch them eat people

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
were you trying to avoid getting eaten by a

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
velociraptor?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
no, you have a robot camera

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
dude, taking a trip down memory lane

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
for a minute, and we're about to get into the

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
classic game a week, so this is okay

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I don't know if you remember this game

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
the original Jurassic Park game that was on

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Super Nintendo, it boasted

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
it was one of the first games that used surround sound

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
and all this stuff, now here's the thing

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
the game was kind of split into two parts

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
there was an overworld thing

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
that was kind of generic, like it was your basic

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
3D

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
ISO type view, where you go

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
around the world collecting things, whatever

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
but then you went into this mode, which was like

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
first person, Doom type thing

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and I'll tell you what, if you played that game with all the lights

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
out and everything back in the game

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
that mode was scary as hell

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
because you would be walking around

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and suddenly a velociraptor comes out of nowhere

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
and crawls your eyeballs out and it's over

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and it was scary

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
did you ever play that game?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
it was freaky, and then Hitler comes out

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
in the robotic machine

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
but I was at just two lanes one time

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
back when they had an arcade and not a pro shop

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and they had

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
for some reason their Jurassic Park

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
shooter game was broken

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and so I got to play on free play

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
the whole time, so I had beaten the arcade one

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
you know what, I'm very disappointed in him

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
this is totally off topic, but that's fine

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
off topic, us, who?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
this show, off topic?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
it has to do with games

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
where the hell is the fucking Silent Hill arcade game

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
locally?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
hey, that's a very good question, what the hell ever happened to that game?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
no one has imported that shit

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
that is a damn good question

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
let's buy one

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
we could put it in the corner right there, that works

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm down, we could just liquidate the funds

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Loki will be very happy at this news

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
guess what the OLR studio is getting next week?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
a couch

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
we are getting a couch, and I'm thinking we're gonna put it right there

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
where Loki usually sits

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
by the way, I'm going to

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
buy us an air conditioner

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
sweet

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
with the funds that were donated to us

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
hooray

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
and we're going to put it in that window

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and we're not gonna burn our asses off

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
here in the studio

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
it's not that bad

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
not right now, but wait until August, hello

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
well we could get more fans, I don't know, we'll get the damn air conditioner

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
you know what, we need

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
a game called beat the heat

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
where you actually take like, pockets of heat

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and beat them to death

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
one other quick thing about Jurassic Park, wasn't it weird

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
that the Genesis version of Jurassic Park was like

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
a completely fucking different game

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
it was like, it was more of a side scroller

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
it was better

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
he could play as the velociraptor and kill people

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
true, alright, there you go

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
just about everything was different

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
you know, for games that would come out on one system

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
versus the other

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
look, nostalgia is awesome

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
and all, but we have another segment we do

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
it's a chance for us to

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
it's nostalgic too?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
it is, very nostalgic, it's a chance for us to pay tribute

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
if you will, to the elders

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
of gaming, what?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I had a list of two

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and thanks to Sauce

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I had a list of one

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
well you'll just use the other one next week, won't you?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I'll probably forget

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and I had to go in the vault to pick this again too

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
look, look

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
this is the last video game of the week

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
for you kids to dig up and play

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and Dark Sakura

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
is dug through the archives with Sauce

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
the archives?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
what is wrong with me tonight? I'm broken, malfunction, malfunction

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
alright, uh

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
exterminate

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
exterminate, what is the classic game

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
the kids should be playing this week?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Space Channel 5

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
cheeseball, cheeseball, cheeseball

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:59.000
play some music!

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
oh did I miss it?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
you want me to go back to it?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Space Channel 5

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.220
And this one is obviously from the Japanese version, but her voice actor in America was

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:42.300
Apollo Smile, who was supposed to be like the blooming anime girl who's actually kind

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.300
of a big hoe.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:49.680
But with this one though, it is technically a music slash puzzle game.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:58.640
And so the whole point of this is that you run into these little aliens called Melodians.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.140
And it's funny when you have your load screen that says Now Meloding, which I felt was pretty

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.140
good.

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:08.440
Anyway, they'll name out a direction and then maybe a shoot button, and you have to mimic

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
it when it's your turn.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.960
And it has to be perfectly in time with the same rhythm that they did.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:19.320
So you have to have a really good sense of rhythm and keep up with it.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:25.120
As you go through, you also have like a little heart blast where you can rescue people.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.720
And so as you're going through the game, if you rescue people, they join your little entourage

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.960
that walks behind you.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.800
And like in the last level, you can actually get Space Michael, as in Michael Jackson.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.560
There's also a Game Boy Advance one that I didn't play because I refused to.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:49.240
And Rez had a Merolian in it as one of the evolutions for the characters.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.200
So that was pretty cool.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.240
There's also the Space Channel 5 minigame in Sega Superstars.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.720
There's a Sonic, uh, the, the, um, Ulala is a hidden character in Sonic Riders.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.920
Um, there's actually a girl who looks like Ulala in Phantasy Star Universe around Chapter

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920
10.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.960
She's the news reporter for Gerhal Channel 5 News.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.960
And it's her theme song.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.960
I've seen that.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960
She's in the, she's in the add-ons too.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.400
Um, Ulala and Pudding are playable characters in, uh, Sega Superstars Tennis.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.760
Pudding is like her rival.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.600
Um, Pudding is also one of the best video game characters ever.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:30.960
Um, there's also, um, Space Channel 5 Part 2 and, um, something actually Rob, do you

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.960
like D-Lite?

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.960
The group D-Lite?

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.400
I, I like the one song that everybody knows by D-Lite.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400
Quick name two D-Lite songs.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.280
Those grooves in the heart that everyone knows.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.480
And I have like, um, their, uh, one of their, uh, their later albums.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.040
I thought it was really good.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.040
But, um, Lady Miss Keir, who is their, their singer, actually, um, opened a lawsuit against

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:57.040
Sega for, uh, basing Ulala off of her without her permission.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.400
And, uh, Hippolytus is in chat right now and knows quite a bit about, uh, D-Lite.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.480
Apparently they split up years ago and Keir Kirby and DJ Dimitri married.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.800
And, uh, Talate was in that group too and he does remixes for like everybody.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800
They were confusing.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.200
But, um, anyway, the way that that went is that, um, Sega, um, offered her $16,000 for

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.640
licensing and to use their songs.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.800
And she refused and they went ahead and made the game anyway, but she lost the lawsuit

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:28.200
and had to pay, um, Sega's regal worth of, uh, $608,000.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:34.680
So, um, and actually that was Michael Jackson doing his own voice acting in the game, by

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:35.680
the way.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.680
Because Michael Jackson loves Sega.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.840
Didn't he only say, like, two things in the game, though?

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.520
He said, thank you, Ulala, and- Sega made that frickin' Moonwalker game, which was all

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.520
kinds of badass.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.520
I know.

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.120
He had a whole big- in Space Channel 5 Part 2, there's a whole part of the game that's

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120
doing nothing but buy the Jackson dances.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.120
Yeah, it's pretty rad.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.120
It's freakin' cool.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:16:00.560
And I really love Space Channel 5 too, but, um, but this, um, this was, like, the game

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560
for me.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560
Space Channel 5.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560
I love this game.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.440
Let's get to the, um, boss music, because it's really awesome.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.760
This is the other big thing, is the great music in the game.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:15.760
I remember this stage.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:36.760
Gerardo mode, boops, he says, the first level of my favorite song is the same.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:17:04.600
This is my favorite music in the game, because it's all shit, shit, shit.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.440
It gets stuck in your head.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.440
So easily.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440
That's the crazy thing about this game.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.040
Well, it's better to- it's easier to tell it in the American version, because it's either

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:17.360
chew or shoot, or, uh, or heart or something, no, it's- what is the other thing she said

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.360
if it- she says chew and she shoots them, and it's something else when, you know, when,

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360
uh, she saves people.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360
Hey, I think is what they say.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.640
But anyway, um, Space Channel 5 too, though, had, like, um, my favorite bad guy in any

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640
game ever, though.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.360
And that was the three robots that had the speakers coming out of their head that would

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360
sing, like, to the, uh, barbershop quartet.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360
I think I remember that.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360
They were awesome.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.160
But, um, we need- we need more Space Channel 5, we need more Lala.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.960
It'll be awesome.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.920
All right, Space Channel 5 is your classic game of the week, available on the Dreamcast,

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.960
um, also- And PlayStation 2.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.000
Repackaged for PlayStation 2, that's right.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.400
So check it out on either of those systems- would you say they're both good, or you need

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400
to actually check it out?

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400
Dreamcast!

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400
Yeah, that's what I figured.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.080
Actually- You always pick Dreamcast games.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080
Actually, actually, actually, Rob.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.080
What?

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:11.520
I have to say that I do have, um, Space Channel 5 2 on PlayStation 2, and it was really good.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.780
And I have played Space Channel 5 on PlayStation 2, and it was also very good.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.120
It was a very good port.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.120
All right.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120
Very cool.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120
All right, I have a request.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.400
Next week, I'm going to challenge you to pick something not Sega.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:31.000
But- I haven't done Sega- I don't- what was- okay, last week was Sega.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
The week before that- oh, the week before that was Sega.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
The week before that.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
The week before that.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Go check the wiki.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I'm just giving you a hard time.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Pick whatever the hell you want.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
But- but Sega's awesome.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Sega is awesome.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I want to hear something creepy.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
What?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And not related to Sega in any way.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Okay.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
They're making another Barbie Horse Adventures game.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The fuck?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Okay.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Chat room.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
People who update our wiki.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.200
I need someone who has, um, elite skills in Excel or Access to, um, uh, put everything

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.520
into a spreadsheet and see what the percentage of games that I have picked that are Sega.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520
All right.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520
Thank you.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
Thank you.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.520
Thank you.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520
It's in Excel.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.520
It's freaking easy.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520
AJ Mix says eight Sega games.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520
Okay.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520
Overall.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520
I guess.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.520
That's not that bad.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.520
That's not that bad.

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520
All right.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.520
Look, I'm just giving her a hard time.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.520
That's what I do here on the program.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520
That's what they pay me to do.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520
But I have to give a hard time back by having no sense of humor.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520
All right.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.520
Rob?

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.520
What?

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.040
We're going to take a well-deserved break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.840
