0	5620	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5620	11620	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11620	14980	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
14980	19460	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19460	24180	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.
24180	27780	It is Sunday, June 8th, 2008, and if you're thinking to yourself,
27780	34780	that's not what day I'm listening to this on my iPod or my Zune or whatever device you use to listen to the podcast, PSP, whatever.
34780	40500	It's because you're not tuning in live. We tape live on Sunday nights, thanks to our friends at allgames.com.
40500	45720	We tape at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.
45720	48260	So sometimes he runs long, sometimes he runs short, just depends.
48260	50760	But usually he catches around 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
50760	55560	Honestly, if you get here at like 4.45, there's a great block of programming on allgames.com.
55560	60200	It starts off with Kopackins UK Gaming News, moves on into the Bobby Black Wolf show,
60200	63060	and ends with us, your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.
63060	67360	We're about to get into the gaming news here for part B.
67360	71620	I just wanted to say real quick though, we got some guests coming up later this month.
71620	76940	I'm trying to arrange some interviews. I don't have anything sealed yet, so I'll get back to you guys on that.
76940	83820	But in studio, one of our long-time OLR friends who hasn't been here in a long time is going to be back in two weeks.
83820	87300	Mikolatov will be here visiting in two weeks, so he'll be back on the program.
87300	90300	So we'll have to play High School Musical stuff for him and get him the game.
90300	92340	Maybe he can tell us what happened to Silent Hill Arcade.
92340	95860	He wanted to go to the whole Happening thing that we were going to do.
95860	98780	I think I may postpone it a week so we can include him as well.
98780	99460	As well.
99460	101340	So, you know.
101340	106300	Because the Happening, I think it's going to suck, but it'll be like a lady in the water.
106300	108740	We can either go all enjoy it or all make fun of it.
108740	111060	Well, since the chatters have no idea what you're talking about,
111060	113940	you're trying to organize people to go see M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, right?
113940	114440	Yes.
114440	114940	I want to see it.
114940	115440	This is the Happening.
115440	115940	Yeah.
115940	117940	I haven't seen Lady in the Water.
117940	119940	Well, consider yourself lucky then.
119940	123820	But I liked, I liked The Village a lot.
123820	126940	I liked The Village too and I thought people were really hard on that movie, but honestly.
126940	128220	And I really liked The Sixth Sense.
128220	132780	I loved The Sixth Sense. I even liked Unbreakable, but seriously, Lady in the Water was shit.
132780	138140	My problem with The Village, my problem with The Village though is they show you what the twist is,
138140	140620	and then they're like, oh, pretend you didn't see that.
140620	142620	You know, we're going to do the twist again.
142620	143620	Oh, just kidding.
143620	144620	It's actually what it was before.
144620	146620	Yeah, that's, that's my problem with it.
146620	147620	All right.
147620	148620	So he'll be back.
148620	150620	I don't know if he can tell us anything about the latest and greatest.
150620	156620	It is a video game employer he was working for for a while, but we'll see if we can prod anything out of him.
156620	161620	And also later this month, June 22nd is the, and I guess he'll be here for it.
161620	167620	The Orange Lounge Radio sixth anniversary show will be on June 22nd, which also happens to be around the time of my birthday.
167620	169620	I'm going to a theme park on my birthday.
169620	174620	Myself and the other half are going to Great America.
174620	181620	That'll be fun because he doesn't really go ride roller coasters, but I told him he has to ride everything I want him to, and he'll scream like a girl.
181620	182620	And we'll get you two.
182620	187620	Roller coasters are, I won't say great because I've only ever really been on one.
187620	189620	But the one I've been on is great.
189620	191620	Which one have you been on?
191620	192620	California Screamin'.
192620	193620	Nice.
193620	194620	You were there.
194620	196620	Oh, I forgot that was like the only one.
196620	200620	Some of the ones they have at like Great America are awesome, like Flight Deck, which used to be top gun.
200620	202620	It's still, it'll always be top gun to me.
202620	203620	Awesomesauce.
203620	208620	But keep in mind, the only ones I will go on has me sitting over the rails, are made of metal.
208620	209620	I will not go on a wood roller coaster.
209620	211620	And have no twisties.
211620	213620	Well, I think Flight Deck has twisties.
213620	217620	What's that one huge arcade game that they have there also at Great America?
217620	220620	The one that you actually go into a separate room to play?
220620	221620	Oh.
221620	222620	I don't remember.
222620	225620	That's when those 3D, no that was a 3D ride.
225620	226620	No, it's not a 3D ride.
226620	228620	It's a video game.
228620	232620	Yeah, it like, it would cost you like 3 bucks to play.
232620	233620	I forget what it's called.
233620	234620	It's on Wikipedia.
234620	235620	It might have been since the last time I've been.
235620	236620	I haven't been.
236620	237620	Kadosho says Goose and Maverick?
237620	238620	Oh, no, no.
238620	240620	Sorry, that's a reference to Top Gun.
240620	241620	What the hell am I thinking?
241620	242620	Nice one.
242620	243620	It's something 3.
243620	244620	I don't remember what it's called.
244620	245620	But anyways.
245620	246620	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
246620	247620	Enough about our personal lives.
247620	249620	Let's talk gaming.
249620	250620	Yes.
250620	260620	So the sci-fi channel, curator of really crappy sci-fi movies and also a variety of TV shows
260620	262620	and reality shows and whatnot.
262620	266620	They are creating a brand new, kind of a hybrid show.
266620	271620	It's gonna be both a TV show and it's also gonna be an MMO.
271620	278620	And it says apparently the integration with the MMO is gonna affect the stuff that happens
278620	279620	on air.
279620	284620	So, for example, they gave, we can tell players that there'll be an alien invasion at a certain
284620	287620	place in the game at a certain time.
287620	292620	And to be there, all their friends and stuff will be ready at that time.
292620	297620	And it says the outcome depends on them and then the battle will be part of the universe
297620	298620	in the show.
298620	304620	So if they fail and they all die, then that will be reflected on the TV show.
304620	306620	Which I think is pretty cool.
306620	314620	And it says both the show and the series will be set 80 to 100 years in the future and launched
314620	318620	sometime sooner than summer of 2010.
318620	323620	When I read this or hear about it, I can't help but think, how awesome would the Battlestar
323620	325620	Galactica game have been if it was this?
325620	326620	You know what I mean?
326620	329620	Like that Battlestar Galactica thing they put on Xbox was like junk.
329620	333620	But there's a great game somewhere in the Battlestar Galactica universe.
333620	337620	And something like this is like an MMO where what happens in the show happens.
337620	338620	That would be awesome!
338620	344620	I don't want to feel the fanboy flames or anything, but wouldn't this be funny?
344620	346620	Just throwing it out there.
346620	352620	If it was like, say, a relaunch of Firefly or something like that.
352620	358620	You know, and they have this whole universe that takes place at the same time and that
358620	359620	kind of thing.
359620	361620	That would be funny.
361620	364620	That would be kind of cool, but sadly I think the cast is all doing other stuff now.
364620	367620	So I guess it could be like a new generation, but I don't know.
367620	371620	This doesn't seem like something that Josh Whedon would be all over.
371620	372620	But you never know, I guess.
372620	373620	I doubt it.
373620	375620	It'd be probably something original.
375620	376620	Most likely.
376620	377620	Most likely.
377620	383620	Well, something else original and actually spotted in the wild this week.
383620	384620	Duke Nukem Forever.
384620	385620	Yes, it exists.
385620	391620	It's out there, and you can actually see a little peek of it in this very strange place.
391620	396620	You would think if Duke Nukem Forever is going to launch its first footage ever, it's going
396620	404620	to be like a one-up exclusive or a game trailer's hot land or whatever they call it.
404620	410620	But it shows up on the Jace Hall show, which now he used to be the monolith boss, and I
410620	413620	guess he has his own little web show now.
413620	415620	And I guess it's kind of like parody.
415620	417620	It's like video game sitcom.
417620	418620	Like the offices.
418620	420620	It's interesting.
420620	425620	But they kind of joke about Duke Nukem Forever, and it actually is Duke Nukem Forever that
425620	427620	you see in the little show.
427620	429620	It's around like the 4 minute and 15 second mark.
429620	437620	And the most surprising thing about it, it actually looks kind of cool for that 30 seconds.
437620	438620	I don't know if it only gets worse.
438620	441620	Hell of a way to hype something up, you know?
441620	449620	This guy just landed a really great exclusive and a hell of a way to kick off his new show.
449620	451620	I mean, he should be...
451620	454620	I don't know what kind of ties he has to the Duke Nukem folks.
454620	456620	I don't know the relationships all these companies had.
456620	460620	Well, I actually watched the show, and it was pretty funny other than that stuff.
460620	464620	They did some interviews with a guy from Heroes.
464620	466620	He's doing his own movie and stuff.
466620	472620	But what the focus of the show is supposed to be is on the people developing the games
472620	474620	and not necessarily the games themselves.
474620	477620	And celebrities who play games and stuff like that.
477620	480620	So that's their kind of spin on things.
480620	483620	Less about the games, but more about the developers and people behind the stuff.
483620	484620	Is it one of those things...
484620	487620	I didn't watch it, I'll be honest, because I didn't care about Duke Nukem Forever footage
487620	489620	because nothing will match the original to me.
489620	496620	But was it one of those things where it's kind of like self-parody
496620	499620	where you really kind of have to be in the know to understand the jokes?
499620	500620	Or was it really accessible?
500620	502620	I don't think so. It wasn't even really parody.
502620	504620	It was just an interview show.
504620	508620	They just shot it in the same way as you would shoot The Office or something like that.
508620	513620	Lots of cuts, lots of just cutting between perspectives and stuff like that
513620	515620	and just talking to people.
515620	520620	And there was some goofy moments, but it was no different than, say, Air...
520620	524620	Okay, I don't want to compare it to AirTainment Tonight or something like that.
524620	529620	But no different than a news show that you would see on TV when they do their news pieces.
529620	532620	Except a little bit more knowledgeable and less cheesy.
532620	535620	But they still were playing around and stuff.
535620	537620	All right.
537620	541620	Well, you can check that out if you're really eager to see some Duke Nukem Forever footage.
541620	544620	We're going to go over to DarkSakura next for her story.
544620	546620	But first, a follow-up to Part A.
546620	550620	Hippolytus in chat has done some math regarding the Classic Games of the Week and says,
550620	557620	although only 8 of the 31 games are made by Sega, 13 are made for Sega Systems.
557620	563620	Which actually, all things, I would have guessed it was much more.
563620	565620	That's not quite half.
565620	568620	I would have guessed it was half.
568620	571620	You know what? Here's the thing.
571620	575620	Sega was grossly overlooked by a lot of people at the time it came out.
575620	577620	I think a lot of people, if they realized...
577620	583620	If you knew then what you know now about the Dreamcast, I bet you it would have done a lot better.
583620	586620	So it's okay that we highlight a lot of those games.
586620	590620	Because a lot of people didn't give them a first look the first time around.
590620	591620	So, whatever.
591620	594620	That's it. Next week is another Dreamcast game.
594620	596620	Fine.
596620	598620	It's going to be like Power Stone or something.
598620	600620	Dreamcast games until we get to half.
600620	602620	Power Stone was awesome, wasn't it?
602620	604620	Power Stone was kind of awesome. I would approve of that, actually.
604620	608620	And you can use your save files from the Japanese version on the US version.
608620	610620	Alright, well keep it a surprise until next week.
610620	611620	I might do that. I don't know.
611620	613620	Meanwhile, more gaming news, yes?
613620	616620	Call of Duty 4!
616620	620620	Didn't that sound awesome? Anyway...
620620	626620	They're getting a variety pack for free for the PC version that's actually going to be offered
626620	630620	as part of a deal with Nvidia.
630620	635620	And it's coming two months after, of course, everyone got it on Xbox 360.
635620	639620	However, like I said, they don't have to pay for it.
639620	644620	Creek and Chinatown are the highlights.
644620	648620	There are new arenas.
648620	652620	There's supposed to be Kill House and Broadcast.
652620	662620	And another one is Patch 1.6 that fixes a server crash exploit and a bunch of bugs.
662620	664620	So there you go.
664620	666620	Hooray, bug fixes!
666620	667620	Yay!
667620	669620	Bug report!
669620	675620	Speaking of fixes and tweaks, there's going to be some new tweaks in line for Team Fortress 2.
675620	680620	The next class to be upgraded, I guess, would be the Pyro class.
680620	688620	They are giving them a brand new, I believe, an axe, which is going to be kind of neat.
688620	694620	Also, there are rumors that they're going to be introducing a sniper class as well.
694620	697620	So, that's neat.
697620	703620	I like to see games that they kind of tweak them as things come out to improve them and make them a little bit better.
703620	709620	But, unfortunately, I have not jumped on the bandwagon and haven't really played Team Fortress 2.
709620	715620	Just mainly because, you know, I like a little single player in my multiplayer games.
715620	717620	But that's just me.
717620	723620	Anyways, the new weapon, as I was saying, is called the Extinguisher.
723620	734620	And I guess it's a weapon that deals half as much damage as a standard fire axe unless you use it against somebody engulfed in flames.
734620	739620	And it deals, I guess, a critical hit. So, that's kind of neat.
739620	745620	And then, like I said, one of the other things that they're going to be doing, I guess, is Meet the Sniper.
745620	748620	So, that's going to be a new character, hopefully.
748620	750620	Wait, Meet the Sniper?
750620	752620	I was thinking of that movie.
752620	753620	Meet the Parents.
753620	754620	No, no.
754620	756620	Meet the Sniper.
756620	759620	They're doing it.
759620	761620	And maybe the sniper is already in the game.
761620	762620	Maybe I'm just an idiot.
762620	764620	Like I said, I don't play this game.
764620	766620	But they are giving the sniper an intro.
766620	771620	They did little intro videos for all the different classes that are in this game.
771620	777620	So, they have little funny videos that kind of explain what the class involves and that kind of thing.
777620	781620	You're not supposed to meet the sniper. They're just supposed to shoot you in the face when you're not looking.
781620	783620	Well, yes.
783620	785620	You can actually be shot in the face and live.
785620	787620	That is true.
787620	792620	So, a good sniper would aim for the neck or the forehead.
792620	796620	Alright, look.
796620	804620	Well, apparently a druid knew where to aim to kill Onyxia all by his little self.
804620	809620	Actually, it might have been a female druid, actually, that did this.
809620	810620	Let's see.
810620	813620	Yeah, it was a female druid, Cyrenia, that did this.
813620	815620	Was it really a female druid or was it a guy playing a female druid?
815620	817620	Probably a guy playing a female druid, just like I am.
817620	820620	Here's the deal. Onyxia, if you're not in the WoW, no.
820620	823620	Onyxia used to be the boss of one of those 40-man raids.
823620	829620	She was a very, very difficult boss to fight and you had to get 40 people together to kill her.
829620	832620	Well, now, that was in the old WoW, before Burning Crusade.
832620	835620	Well, when Burning Crusade came out, everybody can get 10 levels higher.
835620	838620	And even though the old bosses supposedly got a little harder, I don't know.
838620	840620	I don't do a lot of old game content.
840620	844620	Apparently, it's much easier to get there now, getting through trash mobs.
844620	851620	This druid actually soloed Onyxia and was able to do it all by themselves and posted videos all over the internet.
851620	854620	And so, of course, what has to happen next right after that happens?
854620	856620	A paladin's got to go and do the same thing.
856620	863620	So, it's kind of like this druid threw down the gauntlet and then a paladin went and did the same thing.
863620	865620	Went and slayed Onyxia all by themselves.
865620	871620	So, which is kind of a feat to kill what was once a 40-man boss all by your little self is kind of cool.
871620	874620	And I got to say, you guys have been listening to this show long enough.
874620	878620	You know that I'm getting more and more into WoW.
878620	882620	And I've been experiencing the endgame content in it, which is kind of new for me.
882620	885620	Because when I played Final Fantasy XI for all those years, I never got the endgame.
885620	886620	That was all a mystery for me.
886620	888620	But now I'm actually running the 10s and the 25s.
888620	890620	We've been in Serpent Shrine Cavern.
890620	892620	We've been in Tempest Keep.
892620	894620	Now, granted, I haven't gotten to Sunwell yet.
894620	897620	But I feel like I'm making a lot more progression in this game than I ever did with any other MMO.
897620	899620	So, it's been very interesting.
899620	901620	The social dynamics of it is just...
901620	904620	These games are something else. Something else.
904620	906620	I would love to guest on a WoW show, by the way.
906620	913620	If you know of a Warcraft podcast that needs the Rob Roberts perspective, I'd love to go visit someday.
913620	915620	Because WoW is fun to talk about.
915620	920620	But I'm not going to beat you over the head with it here on this show.
920620	932620	Well, in more World of Warcraft news, there is a 27-year-old gamer who is now in Deep Kaka.
932620	937620	He met this girl playing World of Warcraft.
937620	940620	Fell in internet love.
940620	942620	And they ran away together.
942620	944620	Less than three forever.
944620	947620	Now the girl is 14.
947620	948620	Doh.
948620	950620	Oopsie.
950620	953620	She said she was 18 online.
953620	958620	They're actually found in Franklin County, Washington in a campground.
958620	964620	In a campground? Like a KOA?
964620	968620	Is that what it is? This guy and the girl ran off together to a KOA?
968620	970620	They went camping.
970620	972620	They were camping.
972620	974620	Waiting for that spawn.
974620	978620	That was really good.
978620	981620	But, um, yeah.
981620	983620	That's just really sad.
983620	991620	I mean, but what really way is there to control if someone lies or not on the game, right?
991620	993620	Well, I don't think they were lying.
993620	998620	I think she was just touched in the head and, you know, decided,
998620	1000620	Hey, I'm going to go meet this guy.
1000620	1001620	He seems really nice.
1001620	1004620	But mom, I'm in love.
1004620	1007620	Love does cause certain chemical reactions that have mimicked insanity.
1007620	1010620	I'm not joking.
1010620	1012620	I don't know. I could see why he did that.
1012620	1014620	So what's the follow up? Is he in jail now or what happened?
1014620	1015620	Did they do it?
1015620	1017620	I don't know.
1017620	1021620	Let me see.
1021620	1024620	It actually doesn't say. It says he's in legal trouble.
1024620	1025620	Here we go.
1025620	1027620	Well, he's in legal trouble. He must have crossed the line.
1027620	1031620	Um, there's likely what's really running away together is kind of just cross the line.
1031620	1033620	None of that physical stuff really even needs to be involved.
1033620	1036620	Well, it doesn't say what exactly he said.
1036620	1039620	Good old prison time coming in his way, it says.
1039620	1042620	But he's, I think, out on parole right now.
1042620	1043620	Huh?
1043620	1045620	So the question is, will she wait for him?
1045620	1049620	And M 64 in chat changed his nickname to Chris Hansen and said, Hi there.
1049620	1053620	Why don't you have a seat right there?
1053620	1057620	Anyhow, now that's a dateline I'd like to see.
1057620	1060620	Catching the wow predators.
1060620	1063620	He's got his hair slicked back. He's wearing a black T-shirt.
1063620	1069620	Yeah, it looks like it looks like the kind of guy who, uh,
1069620	1075620	and the sad thing is that I know people like this who just sit in front of their computer
1075620	1079620	and, you know, have a microwave right beside it and eat nothing but ramen.
1079620	1083620	You can't put a microwave next to your computer because it'll interfere with your speakers.
1083620	1084620	Got to put it a few feet away.
1084620	1087620	Bobby Blackwell has an obvious point I didn't even think about.
1087620	1089620	He says he crossed state lines with a minor. It's kidnapping.
1089620	1090620	Yeah.
1090620	1092620	So that's why he's in trouble.
1092620	1095620	He should have done his research first, dumbass.
1095620	1098620	There's campgrounds all over the place.
1098620	1101620	Frisbee said, there's KOAs everywhere.
1101620	1104620	Frisbee says, what level did she say she was?
1104620	1107620	I didn't say anything about it.
1107620	1110620	All right. She was over 18.
1110620	1113620	She told me she was 70.
1113620	1118620	All right. Well, anyway, people acting stupid and giving games like, wow, a bad name,
1118620	1120620	definitely make us a little bit angsty.
1120620	1124620	And when we hear about stupid people running away with 14-year-olds across state lines,
1124620	1125620	we get a little bit angsty.
1125620	1126620	And you know what that means?
1126620	1129620	It's time for a little segment we call F.U. of the Week.
1129620	1150620	My F.U. of the Week.
1150620	1156620	Well, really, I guess it's more, I guess, self-directed because I'm really nervous about something
1156620	1159620	that's going to be going on tomorrow.
1159620	1161620	And I want it to go well.
1161620	1167620	And I don't want to do my nervous habit of talking, like, wildly while this is going on out of nerves.
1167620	1170620	So F.U. to nerves.
1170620	1173620	Just out of concern for the listeners, though, it's not medical.
1173620	1174620	You're not in, like, any type of...
1174620	1176620	I'm going in for a job interview, okay?
1176620	1177620	Well, I just want to clarify.
1177620	1179620	People don't need to be worried about your health or anything.
1179620	1180620	You're fine there.
1180620	1185620	No, I don't have any type of degenerative diseases other than the walking pneumonia
1185620	1187620	and the bookies that you flew.
1187620	1188620	All right.
1188620	1189620	You didn't have to tell.
1189620	1190620	I'm sorry.
1190620	1192620	I just wanted to make sure the listeners didn't get worried.
1192620	1193620	Loki.
1193620	1202620	I guess F.U. to stupid workers at Round Table for taking 40 minutes to make two-minute breadsticks.
1202620	1203620	What can I say?
1203620	1206620	I used to work there, so I know how long it takes.
1206620	1208620	It does not take 40 minutes.
1208620	1212620	And God, hire some more intelligent people for your front counters.
1212620	1214620	I hated that shit.
1214620	1216620	My F.U. of the week goes to my tooth.
1216620	1219620	I've been having all this pain in my mouth, one of my teeth.
1219620	1221620	I know it's probably got to have a root canal or something.
1221620	1223620	It's got to be a bad situation.
1223620	1224620	It's been hurting a lot.
1224620	1226620	I don't think I've ever had a tooth hurt this bad.
1226620	1229620	I'm, like, constantly having to take Tylenol or Advil or something.
1229620	1232620	And that means I'm actually going to have to go to the dentist on Monday.
1232620	1233620	Now, here's the thing, you guys.
1233620	1234620	I just...
1234620	1235620	I don't like the dentist.
1235620	1237620	And a lot of people have those, like, fears of the dentist.
1237620	1239620	It's not that I'm necessarily afraid of the dentist.
1239620	1242620	I just hate the dentist because dentists are, like, used car salesmen.
1242620	1244620	They try to sell you stuff you don't need, I swear to God.
1244620	1245620	Not my dentist.
1245620	1248620	My last dentist, well, this is a true story about an experience I had with a dentist.
1248620	1250620	Maybe it's just HMO versus PPO.
1250620	1251620	Now that I have PPO, it'll be better.
1251620	1257620	But the last dentist I had tried to tell me I needed a replacement crown that was $1,200.
1257620	1259620	Now, granted, I did need the replacement crown,
1259620	1264620	but what they neglected to tell me was that my plan would also cover a crown that was only $300.
1264620	1266620	So they were purposely trying to rip me off.
1266620	1271620	You know how, like, how much that turns me off to dentists in general?
1271620	1273620	Like, it makes me feel like I'm going to go buy a used car.
1273620	1278620	And I agree that, like, dental health is important and I'm a fucking moron for not going to the dentist more often.
1278620	1281620	But if that's the kind of treatment I'm going to get, do you understand why I don't like going?
1281620	1283620	Exactly. I totally understand.
1283620	1287620	Let's see. Well, I'll tell you later.
1287620	1290620	I told you earlier that, you know, I'd recommend my dentist to you.
1290620	1291620	Right.
1291620	1292620	Because they've never...
1292620	1297620	And I haven't been to the dentist, except for this one, since I live, like, in the third grade,
1297620	1299620	because we didn't have insurance for that. We couldn't afford it.
1299620	1300620	Right.
1300620	1303620	So, okay. Po.
1303620	1310620	But the dentist that I go to, they give you cookies when you leave.
1310620	1311620	Aww.
1311620	1313620	And they're good cookies.
1313620	1314620	How cute.
1314620	1319620	And the chairs, I fall asleep in their chairs. They're memory foam.
1319620	1323620	And both of them are professional, so they don't try to sell you shit you don't need.
1323620	1326620	They just put it out there and let you review it if you want it.
1326620	1328620	That's what I need. That's what I need.
1328620	1331620	When I got all of my fillings done, they said, you have...
1331620	1334620	Here's a composite. Here's this one. Here's this one. Here's this one.
1334620	1336620	This is what the pros and cons of this one are.
1336620	1337620	This is the pros and cons of this one.
1337620	1339620	That's perfect.
1339620	1342620	Okay, if this... Now, see, I did end up... Before Jamie knew, I had problems.
1342620	1346620	I just scheduled with somebody else. A coworker recommended him, and he's, like, right around the corner.
1346620	1347620	So, you know.
1347620	1350620	So I'm going to check it out and hope it's a little better, because what I like about this,
1350620	1354620	it's just one guy, his assistant, and the front desk lady, all in...
1354620	1357620	You know, it's not a big company, and those big companies tend to screw you more.
1357620	1362620	Well, also, this one's not a big one, and also, if you go to my dentist, I get a $50 gift certificate for all of them.
1362620	1363620	Motives.
1363620	1365620	No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
1365620	1371620	But they do... But, you know, because they're a small business, they offer perks to their clients.
1371620	1375620	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Rob, my dad wouldn't do that to you.
1375620	1378620	See, that's awesome that, you know, we know somebody whose dad's a dentist.
1378620	1382620	I would go to a family or friend dentist in a heartbeat. I don't know any.
1382620	1386620	Unfortunately, SSJ100Matt's in New York City, and I can't exactly fly to New York to have my dental work done.
1386620	1390620	That's not very cost-effective.
1390620	1395620	So that's going to do it for the FUs of the week. Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
1395620	1401620	You know, and it doesn't really matter. I mean, we're not that rich yet to where we can fly out to New York to get your dental work done.
1401620	1407620	Maybe someday. When we are, you know, rich internet celebrities, I will totally fly out to New York just to see SSJ100Matt's dad.
1407620	1411620	Because at least I know I can, like, trust him, because Matt will put in a good word for me.
1411620	1417620	Well, I'm not sure if this guy's a rich internet celebrity. I know he's probably a celebrity, at least in the gaming world.
1417620	1421620	But Nolan Bushnell, he has a biopic that's being made about him.
1421620	1427620	And, you know, must we forget that he also, you know, founded Chuck E. Cheese.
1427620	1429620	Wait, they're making a biopic about Nolan Bushnell?
1429620	1430620	Yes.
1430620	1435620	What's the story there? Just the fact that he invented all these things?
1435620	1440620	I mean, the story is Chuck E. Cheese is fucking awesome. Or was fucking awesome.
1440620	1441620	I stand corrected.
1441620	1443620	The pizza sucks ass.
1443620	1446620	It doesn't matter. They had cool arcades at one time.
1446620	1447620	In the 80s.
1447620	1451620	I say one time, because all those arcades have been replaced with neon lights and ticket redemption machines.
1451620	1453620	They had that Ferrari game. That Ferrari game's cool.
1453620	1456620	Anyways, so apparently...
1456620	1460620	Dude, I should have my 30th birthday at Chuck E. Cheese. How awesome would that be?
1460620	1469620	Apparently, Paramount Pictures has picked up the movie, and Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be attached to star in the movie as Nolan Bushnell.
1469620	1473620	That's kind of weird, in a way.
1473620	1475620	How does he look like...
1475620	1477620	Makeup? I don't know.
1477620	1481620	Wait, Black Wolf says, Sky, they won't let you. They won't let me.
1481620	1482620	What?
1482620	1483620	They won't let me.
1483620	1485620	You're a paying customer.
1485620	1491620	They won't let me have my birthday party. I've had some friends try. They got kicked out because they have no kids.
1491620	1493620	That's... It's not racist, but it's ageist.
1493620	1495620	It's because I'm gay.
1495620	1497620	No.
1497620	1499620	What?
1499620	1503620	Why don't we invite people we know who have children?
1503620	1506620	Because I don't want no kids ruining my birthday party.
1506620	1510620	But people that we know would know how to raise their children, right?
1510620	1517620	I would take it to the management and just complain and then make a big fuss about it and get on the news.
1517620	1523620	Great. Then my fa... I would be the poster child for 30-year-olds wanting to have their birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.
1523620	1526620	I'm not sure I really, really want that.
1526620	1528620	You know what you do, Rob?
1528620	1529620	What?
1529620	1532620	You just don't tell them you're having your birthday party.
1532620	1536620	Vandalous in chat says, Incredible Pizza Factory is more fun anyway.
1536620	1539620	I don't know if he's talking about John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
1539620	1542620	I don't know. Here's the thing with John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
1542620	1548620	I would agree that it's a pretty rad place and that the food is a slight step better, only slight.
1548620	1549620	You can't...
1549620	1553620	But here's the thing. There's no animatronic animals. And for that, it fails.
1553620	1556620	We could put Loki in a teagull costume.
1556620	1558620	That might be a little better.
1558620	1561620	I'm not an animatronic animal and normally I dress up in a teagull costume.
1561620	1563620	But it's my birthday!
1563620	1564620	I don't give a shit.
1564620	1565620	Rob, Rob, Rob.
1565620	1567620	Ranma makes the best suggestion ever.
1567620	1568620	What?
1568620	1570620	Dave and Busters.
1570620	1572620	Too far! Too far!
1572620	1573620	I used to go every year.
1573620	1574620	I don't care.
1574620	1575620	I went to Disneyland last year.
1575620	1576620	I want to go to Disneyland for my birthday.
1576620	1578620	Oh my god, Rob. Let's go to Disneyland.
1578620	1583620	Wait, Black Wolf finishes the story here. I know this has nothing to do with games, but I don't care.
1583620	1586620	Adults wanting to go to Chuck E. Cheese is a very important topic.
1586620	1589620	I mean, my friends were just trying to go there for lunch one day.
1589620	1590620	Company outing.
1590620	1595620	They were stopped at the door and told that they weren't welcome because they might have overrun the place for the kids.
1595620	1598620	Dude, we went there in college once and they didn't say anything.
1598620	1600620	We went there on a weeknight once in college and they didn't say anything.
1600620	1602620	We've walked in the...
1602620	1603620	Don't ask me why.
1603620	1610620	Back when Qzar was open, someone actually ordered pizza from Chuck E. Cheese because they had takeout also.
1610620	1611620	Why?
1611620	1613620	I don't know.
1613620	1616620	Who always said, mmm, mmm, I'm craving Chuck E. Cheese, crapola pizza?
1616620	1619620	I think it was mmm, mmm, I'm pole.
1619620	1622620	I have to say this.
1622620	1631620	And by the way, when I was in high school after I graduated, we decided to all go to Chuck E. Cheese's
1631620	1634620	and I got humped by the person playing Chuck E. Cheese.
1634620	1636620	He was also my boyfriend at the time.
1636620	1637620	Oh, well, okay.
1637620	1639620	Ha! You were in the furries!
1639620	1640620	No.
1640620	1642620	Oh, my God, you had sex with Chuck E. Cheese.
1642620	1643620	No.
1643620	1644620	It was...
1644620	1645620	Furry lover!
1645620	1647620	It was silly.
1647620	1656620	But, you know, we went in there and, you know, I had a bunch of my friends there and, you know, we ate shitty pizza
1656620	1662620	and played skee-ball until we puked and it was fun and no one ever did shit about it.
1662620	1664620	CC's Pizza is an East Coast chain anyways.
1664620	1665620	There's a CC's.
1665620	1666620	Not around here.
1666620	1668620	Oh, Black Wolf is around CC's Pizza. I've never heard of it.
1668620	1669620	There's a CC's Pizza.
1669620	1671620	They have this, like, thing that's on TV they're talking about.
1671620	1672620	My brother worked at CC's Pizza.
1672620	1676620	A buffet and stuff and it's like five bucks and the pizza looks like it's worth every penny.
1676620	1680620	It's like five dollar cardboard shit pizza.
1680620	1684620	DJ Morpheus says, there are times that Loki sounds like an animatronic animal.
1684620	1691620	Well, I also have to say, Patty said in our chat room that she got kicked out of there when she was 18 and had a kid with her.
1691620	1692620	Alright.
1692620	1693620	Jeez.
1693620	1695620	I have a better suggestion for you.
1695620	1696620	It's just cruddy.
1696620	1697620	It's not quite Chuck E. Cheese.
1697620	1698620	It's not quite...
1698620	1699620	Go to Scandia.
1699620	1704620	Not the Scandia in Sacramento, but the Scandia more towards Vallejo.
1704620	1705620	Okay.
1705620	1706620	That's where you need to go.
1706620	1714620	Because there's no water park. There's no Super Ghetto Kids raining around. It's just arcade, go-karts, and golf. Like, God intended it.
1714620	1723620	And they have, like, tons of SNK machines and the Taito games.
1723620	1725620	I've never set foot in there. I drive by it every time I go to the bay.
1725620	1726620	Oh my God, they're great.
1726620	1729620	Is that what they actually advertise on the sign, Loki?
1729620	1733620	Arcade, golf, and go-karts. The way God intended it.
1733620	1735620	That's the way it should be.
1735620	1736620	Alright.
1736620	1738620	So what, Leonardo DiCaprio, what?
1738620	1742620	He's gonna play, I guess, Nolan Bushnell. And I think the movie's actually entitled Atari, so...
1742620	1743620	Interesting.
1743620	1744620	Uh-huh.
1744620	1745620	Alright.
1745620	1750620	Orange Lounge Fudio? No, now it's, like, Orange Lounge Chuck E. Cheesio.
1750620	1752620	Uh, anyhow, let's go...
1752620	1757620	We were talking about games, okay? Games, Nolan Bushnell created Chuck E. Cheese. We were talking about Chuck E. Cheese.
1757620	1758620	It's still relevant.
1758620	1762620	This is a topic that always comes up on our show, actually, is whatever happened to awesome arcades?
1762620	1763620	Right?
1763620	1764620	Exactly.
1764620	1765620	It's a myth.
1765620	1766620	Exactly.
1766620	1767620	They've fallen into obscurity.
1767620	1772620	Well, it's sad that, you know, our kids are only gonna have to hear stories about, you know, the arcades.
1772620	1777620	It's gonna make it sound like, you know, when our parents told us about the sock-hop. Woohoo!
1777620	1779620	I don't wanna ever hear about the sock-hop.
1779620	1780620	Right.
1782620	1784620	Okay, no more tangents, just...
1784620	1787620	Are you sure? One more? You good for one more, Jamie?
1787620	1789620	Come on, Tangent Lounge Radio.
1790620	1792620	That was the Ferret's Tangent.
1792620	1793620	Continue!
1793620	1794620	You're withholding, I know it.
1794620	1795620	I am.
1795620	1796620	Alright, EverQuest.
1796620	1797620	These are good cashews.
1797620	1799620	Orange Lounge EverQuest deal.
1799620	1801620	Here's the deal with EverQuest.
1802620	1806620	Sony Online Entertainment, also known as SOE, or as I call it, S.O.E.
1807620	1812620	S.O.E. has reactivated all of the G.O.N. players.
1812620	1822620	Basically, if you left, you know, if you abandoned EverQuest some time ago, S.O.E. has reactivated your account for two free months for both EverQuest and EverQuest 2.
1822620	1823620	That is everybody.
1823620	1826620	So if you left the game, it's time to come back.
1826620	1831620	Here's the thing. S.O.E. also included all of EverQuest's expansions in those accounts.
1831620	1838620	And you get bonuses to help your players that are, you know, out of date, get them up to speed.
1838620	1843620	So, kinda interesting there. It's called the Living Legacy campaign.
1843620	1846620	So it's basically a way to try to sucker people back into EverCrack.
1846620	1851620	Hey, it's two months for free. Just take a break from World of Warcraft and go grief some people. There you go.
1851620	1857620	You know what? EverQuest is one of those games I never really got into because I got into Final Fantasy XI instead.
1857620	1863620	Like, about the time I would have gotten into EverQuest, somebody showed me, like, Japanese Final Fantasy XI and I was like, ooh, I'm waiting for this.
1863620	1867620	It's Final Fantasy and it's online. What more do you want?
1867620	1872620	Here's what I worry about. Final Fantasy is going to do something like this in the future and I'm going to be like, kind of want.
1872620	1874620	Final Fantasy XIV.
1874620	1875620	Kind of want.
1875620	1877620	Actually, it's just Final Fantasy online or something.
1877620	1879620	Alright. Anyhow.
1879620	1880620	Stuff.
1880620	1881620	Yes.
1881620	1882620	And nonsense.
1882620	1884620	Like, this nonsense. No, I'm kidding.
1884620	1888620	Can I read a comment from chat real quick? I gotta say it. Because it's about the arcade thing we're talking about.
1888620	1894620	Sairan in chat says, I only hear stories about awesome arcades and it makes me cry that there are no more.
1894620	1906620	I guess we have to realize that there actually are, you know, I don't want to say younger kids, but, you know, teenagers that are now teenagers that were, like, you know, too young to remember when we were teenagers that are already going through this.
1906620	1907620	It kinda sucks.
1907620	1908620	Yeah.
1908620	1912620	They will never know how awesome it was to stand on a booster seat to play Crystal Castles.
1912620	1917620	Well, it's like even when I was in high school, and I'm sorry for going off on another little small thing.
1917620	1918620	It's what we do here.
1918620	1924620	Because, you know, but when my little brother Matthew got hit by a car when he was six and I was still a freshman in high school.
1924620	1934620	And I remember, you know, being dropped off at the mall to go see a movie with my friend Jennifer and we went and hung out in the arcade.
1934620	1936620	Like, for hours!
1936620	1939620	Exactly! Tilt, they used to have tilts in the malls and stuff like that.
1939620	1940620	Which is now Hot Topic.
1940620	1944620	Well, Tilt got purchased by Namco.
1944620	1947620	I can tell you that because I worked for Namco Arcade when all this was going on.
1947620	1953620	But we had Aladdin's Castle inside, we actually got a cyber station later.
1953620	1958620	The Aladdin's Castle got turned into a cyber station and they opened an Aladdin's Castle in the mall across the street.
1958620	1959620	I worked at them both.
1959620	1966620	Anyway, that was actually right around the time that arcade started, you know, sucking was when I quit working in one.
1966620	1970620	But anyway, I was there all day. I was playing Samurai Shodown 2.
1970620	1974620	We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that day.
1974620	1975620	Rad.
1975620	1979620	Except that right when we beat the game they freaking turned off the machine.
1979620	1980620	Fuckers.
1980620	1984620	Anyway, and these guys paid for me to play. It was awesome because they wanted to do a four person game.
1984620	1985620	They're like, here we have money.
1985620	1986620	Okay.
1986620	1987620	They paid you to do it four way?
1987620	1988620	Oh baby.
1988620	1990620	I played Leonardo, so that's kind of cheating.
1990620	1994620	But anyway, and I can't believe I still remember.
1994620	1998620	It's because my brother was injured that that really stuck out in my mind.
1998620	2002620	But you know, we played, there's air hockey.
2002620	2005620	Arcades, like only a few have air hockey anymore.
2005620	2006620	That is sad.
2006620	2007620	That is fucking criminal.
2007620	2011620	I mean, what arcade is perfect if you're not dodging air hockey pellets?
2011620	2016620	Speaking of perfect arcade, and I apologize for a moment to our international audience.
2016620	2021620	This is a very local reference, but DJ Morpheus brought this up and I have to know if Jamie's ever been here.
2021620	2022620	What?
2022620	2024620	Did you ever go to Sam's Town in Cameron Park when it was up and running?
2024620	2025620	Oh yeah.
2025620	2029620	Oh my God, that place was incredible.
2029620	2030620	Dan told me about the mine shaft.
2030620	2033620	Oh, that was, oh, I miss arcades.
2033620	2035620	He said that part of it was underground.
2035620	2037620	Yes, the mine shaft, it was a golf course.
2037620	2039620	The golf course started underground.
2039620	2040620	It was like a mine shaft and you would go upstairs.
2040620	2042620	It would go above ground after like the first three holes.
2042620	2044620	I've seen the remnants of it.
2044620	2051620	There was also an part of the arcade where there was a two floor arcade upstairs had all the little kids games like Noah's arc and stuff.
2051620	2055620	And then downstairs, my God, they had everything, everything you can imagine.
2055620	2061620	You know what arcade, I think this is one of the last of the great arcades was the bird cage arcade that we had here.
2061620	2062620	No.
2062620	2064620	Cause the bird cage, I'm sorry for people.
2064620	2067620	I know this is way out of that, but this is where a lot of the new.
2067620	2068620	We're having a moment.
2068620	2069620	Damn it.
2069620	2071620	Bird cage arcade got all of the new fighting games.
2071620	2072620	All of them.
2072620	2075620	It didn't matter if they had to import them, they got them.
2075620	2085620	And, um, we actually, uh, well at the time, and I'm not going to say his name because a lot of people in the DDR community, especially doesn't, but a friend of ours, uh, worked for Capcom for awhile.
2085620	2092620	And it was funny watching him just completely hand people, their asses one handed, you know, at any of the fighting games.
2092620	2100620	And it was just like, and that was like right when I first moved out here and then they started tearing down all the stuff that made the bird cage area cool.
2100620	2111620	Like the theater where Rocky was and the arcade and they're trying to take out the element that was, they said they're trying to, to make it safer for better clientele.
2111620	2113620	But in reality, I think that it's hurt the business.
2113620	2115620	They're fucking rich white people ruining our culture.
2115620	2120620	I know, but is it just me or have you seen more business businesses there though?
2120620	2124620	Closed since keeping that place alive is the fact there's a Barnes and Noble.
2124620	2125620	I don't like it anymore.
2125620	2127620	There's no comic shop.
2127620	2133620	There's no bowling alley. There's no dollar store that sells t-shirts that say, fuck this.
2133620	2135620	And now international imports is going out of business.
2135620	2136620	That's sad.
2136620	2138620	I know one more thing I got to say about the local stuff.
2138620	2139620	Sam's town.
2139620	2143620	Uh, DJ Morpheus says the mine shaft was like a third of the size of Sam town.
2143620	2144620	And that's true.
2144620	2145620	Like, let me put it this way.
2145620	2146620	Sam's town.
2146620	2153620	Like when you went to go spend your tickets, you spent them in a general store and you could buy like, you know, like those little candy cane things.
2153620	2155620	Like some tastes like licorice and some tastes like mint.
2155620	2158620	Like you can spend, I mean, fond memories of that place.
2158620	2159620	That's shit.
2159620	2162620	Sam's town was like around since my mom was a child and stuff like that too.
2162620	2163620	I mean, all right.
2163620	2164620	And then they had to tear it down.
2164620	2169620	Sorry for the moment of, as a, what, who is it in chat that said we were old people?
2169620	2170620	Yeah.
2170620	2171620	Cason.
2171620	2172620	I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, but you did call us old people.
2172620	2175620	It says an old person's moment.
2175620	2176620	All right.
2176620	2179620	No, it's just even the fact that we had awesome shit and you don't.
2179620	2180620	Yes.
2180620	2182620	We're reminiscing about better times, kids.
2182620	2183620	All right.
2183620	2186620	Except that I didn't walk to school both ways uphill.
2186620	2187620	So whatever.
2187620	2188620	All right.
2188620	2189620	Sorry, Jamie.
2189620	2191620	You can do your story about a story, right?
2191620	2192620	Yeah.
2192620	2195620	Strong bad game.
2195620	2200620	The game is called strong bad school game for attractive people made by telltale.
2200620	2203620	And it is going to be an episodic humor game.
2203620	2205620	But guess what?
2205620	2207620	It's delayed.
2207620	2214620	It's release has been pushed to July.
2214620	2215620	It doesn't.
2215620	2218620	Well, it says from June from the original release month into the next month.
2218620	2225620	So from June to July to polish it up a little bit.
2225620	2230620	And I really want to play this game because it's awesome.
2230620	2234620	And I love the trailers for it, but.
2234620	2237620	Well, it's obviously directed at me because it does say awesome people.
2237620	2239620	But here's this is attractive people.
2239620	2240620	Here's the thing.
2240620	2241620	If you want to know a little more, that's me too.
2241620	2244620	If you want to know a little more about the real insight to what's going on here,
2244620	2247620	listen to the very end of Bobby Black Wolf show this week when we're on.
2247620	2248620	I'm not going to spoil it,
2248620	2251620	but he gives a little more insight as to what could be possibly up with this delay.
2251620	2253620	So I'll leave you with that little teaser.
2253620	2256620	I will be sure to you do that right now.
2256620	2257620	Download it right now.
2257620	2258620	Go do it right now.
2258620	2260620	Because we're broadcasting and I love fix our bandwidth.
2260620	2262620	So go now.
2262620	2263620	No.
2263620	2267620	Lucky saved the show from what you and I.
2267620	2272620	There is an interesting job posting over in Nintendo's official Web site.
2272620	2276620	The job posting was for a software hardware tester,
2276620	2281620	and their description of duties would be creating and executing a test plan for
2281620	2284620	Wiis USB devices.
2284620	2290620	And it goes on saying, you know, writing, testing, documentation, whatever.
2290620	2297620	Anyways, but the whole fact is that there's going to be Wii USB devices.
2297620	2298620	Storage, perhaps?
2298620	2299620	Hard drive?
2299620	2300620	Hello?
2300620	2301620	OMG.
2301620	2302620	Please?
2302620	2305620	That would be smart.
2305620	2309620	So cross your fingers that that's what that actually means.
2309620	2311620	I hope so.
2311620	2312620	DMN in chat says,
2312620	2316620	Sky is so old he owes Nolan Bushnell a quarter.
2316620	2317620	Nice.
2317620	2319620	Asshole.
2319620	2322620	Hey DarkSakura, you know what else I miss?
2322620	2324620	Roller rinks.
2324620	2328620	I've actually been to the one on Auburn, the Foothills skating rink,
2328620	2330620	like in the last couple of years.
2330620	2331620	I went there too.
2331620	2333620	And I'm still fucking awesome at it.
2333620	2334620	Alright.
2334620	2336620	I'm not going to let this show get derailed.
2336620	2337620	I'm just kidding.
2337620	2339620	Rob and I are going to go roller skating next week and video tape it.
2339620	2341620	I almost played DDR and roller skates once.
2341620	2343620	I thought you didn't want to be on camera.
2343620	2344620	I will be on camera.
2344620	2345620	I'll be video taping it.
2345620	2346620	Fine.
2346620	2348620	I said I wanted to go ice skating actually.
2348620	2349620	I've never been.
2349620	2350620	I hate ice skating.
2350620	2351620	Must happen.
2351620	2352620	I love ice skating.
2352620	2353620	Anyway.
2353620	2354620	Okay.
2354620	2356620	Rob's story.
2356620	2357620	Virtual Console.
2357620	2358620	SNK.
2358620	2359620	What more do you need to know?
2359620	2362620	There's lots of SNK stuff apparently heading to Virtual Console soon.
2362620	2364620	Not just Samurai Shodown as you heard in part A,
2364620	2367620	but apparently Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury 2, Burning Fight,
2367620	2371620	they are all apparently on their way to the Virtual Console.
2371620	2374620	This is the ESRB of course spilling all this.
2374620	2377620	Also on the list, Dig Dug is on the list.
2377620	2380620	Now that's probably not the arcade version because you don't really see that on the Wii.
2380620	2383620	Probably the NES version because it didn't really come out anywhere else
2383620	2385620	that the Wii currently supports.
2385620	2388620	By the way, just so you know, also on the ESRB,
2388620	2390620	it's completely unrelated, PlayStation 3,
2390620	2394620	ratings for The Last Guy and Wipeout HD have both appeared
2394620	2397620	and hopefully that means that they are almost on their way.
2397620	2400620	So we'll be looking forward to seeing those games soon
2400620	2402620	because Wipeout is kind of cool.
2402620	2407620	For our Pokemon fans that are listening,
2407620	2410620	and I'm not going to say that Pokemon makes everything better,
2410620	2418620	but GameStop is going to be giving away a download of a free Pokemon.
2418620	2425620	Forgive me if I mispronounce this, but Deoxys,
2425620	2428620	which is a psychic type Pokemon that has four different forms.
2428620	2432620	If you've got Pokemon Diamond or Pearl, you can go to a GameStop
2432620	2439620	and download it and then they'll harass you about pre-ordering stuff.
2439620	2441620	But hey, you can have Pokemons.
2441620	2444620	I know, it looks freaking bizarre.
2444620	2448620	Very interesting comment from chat about kind of the tangent conversations we were having
2448620	2450620	and it comes from Sairan who was kind of commenting earlier
2450620	2452620	about being young and missing a lot of this.
2452620	2453620	It says something very interesting.
2453620	2456620	People robbed Jamie Matt's age, had awesome arcades.
2456620	2459620	People in the 60s, my mom's generation, had Woodstock,
2459620	2462620	the Beatles, the Summer of Love, and other cool things.
2462620	2467620	The majority of my generation just has the Iraq War, George Bush, and shitty music.
2467620	2471620	The Otaku demographic at least has somewhat of a boom of the anime industry,
2471620	2473620	but that's about it.
2473620	2479620	That's a very, very good summary of it.
2479620	2481620	There's probably cool things about your generation,
2481620	2485620	but you're not really going to realize them until like 20 years later.
2485620	2488620	That's the thing is that right now in this 2000s,
2488620	2490620	have they ever come up with the name for the O's?
2490620	2491620	The O-O's or whatever?
2491620	2492620	The O's.
2492620	2493620	The O's.
2493620	2496620	Here in the O's, the 80s are making a comeback.
2496620	2498620	Just like how in the 90s, the 70s are making a comeback.
2498620	2500620	Here's the thing.
2500620	2504620	When we start getting into the 10s, the 90s will make a comeback
2504620	2506620	and all those things you forgot about will be cool again.
2506620	2510620	So then again, it's going to be the late 60s, early 70s look again.
2510620	2512620	Perhaps.
2512620	2516620	Maybe in the 10s people are going to go back to the Victorian look,
2516620	2521620	which people kind of did in the early 80s now that I think about it.
2521620	2523620	It's kind of cool.
2523620	2524620	Just something to think about.
2524620	2525620	I don't know.
2525620	2530620	Sometimes trends have a way of coming full cycle as folks that were teens become 30s.
2530620	2531620	I have to share this with you.
2531620	2534620	Sauce says it's the Ot.
2534620	2536620	I realize that's like the technical term for it,
2536620	2541620	but who really says that as freely as they say the 80s, the 90s?
2541620	2543620	You're not going to see it on VH1.
2543620	2545620	I love the Ot.
2545620	2546620	People in Europe?
2546620	2547620	I guess.
2547620	2551620	Because if I'm correct, zero is referred to as Ot.
2551620	2554620	Alright, whatever, whatever.
2554620	2556620	Black Wolf brings up a good point.
2556620	2559620	In 20 years you may be telling young kids about how there was this internet
2559620	2562620	where you could look up anything and read about anything
2562620	2567620	and all the information was equal kind of referencing the net neutrality laws
2567620	2571620	that are kind of making waves this week.
2571620	2572620	That's true.
2572620	2574620	You guys did grow up in the internet age.
2574620	2575620	That is something.
2575620	2577620	We didn't really have that when I was in early high school.
2577620	2580620	It was BBS is for life, bitch.
2580620	2583620	When we were some of these people's age,
2583620	2589620	the internet actually was still military only and illegal for anyone else to network.
2589620	2594620	You totally just said when I was your age.
2594620	2596620	I understand though.
2596620	2599620	When we were little, it was true.
2599620	2605620	The internet has been in existence since, I do believe, 1972 or 74 around that time.
2605620	2606620	Whenever Al Gore invented it, right?
2606620	2607620	Whenever.
2607620	2610620	But it was military use only, and if anyone was caught networking
2610620	2617620	like in the early 80s or so, they actually could be arrested for it.
2617620	2624620	I remember my friend's dad who is in his 60s now is an engineer,
2624620	2630620	and he was talking about lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.
2630620	2633620	I thought that was pretty crazy.
2633620	2634620	Yeah, anyway.
2634620	2635620	All right.
2635620	2636620	Just thought that might be a little perspective.
2636620	2638620	Lots of reminiscing tonight.
2638620	2640620	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
2640620	2641620	Sorry, kids.
2641620	2646620	Well, a show that likes to reminisce as well, Video Games Live,
2646620	2651620	will be coming, or they have announced actually 50 different shows for their world tour.
2651620	2655620	Of course, Video Games Live, for those who may not remember,
2655620	2659620	is the show that has all sorts of orchestrated music from video games,
2659620	2664620	including Legend of Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, et cetera.
2664620	2668620	This year though, I'm glad to see that it looks like around August
2668620	2673620	they're going to be coming towards San Jose, so we'll be able to hit that up actually.
2673620	2686620	All over the place, including Canada, France, Scotland, the United States, Portugal, Brazil,
2686620	2693620	China, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Moscow, Russia, and Norway and Sweden.
2693620	2696620	So when they say world tour, they don't mean just like US and Canada.
2696620	2697620	They mean the freaking world.
2697620	2698620	Yes.
2698620	2699620	That's pretty cool.
2699620	2700620	That'd be fun to travel on.
2700620	2705620	Like I said, for those folks local to Orange Lodge Radio here,
2705620	2712620	August 26th you've got San Jose at the Performing Arts Center during the Envision 08.
2712620	2715620	That convention's going to be going on.
2715620	2719620	And then also they're coming back around again in San Francisco.
2719620	2721620	No date on that though.
2721620	2726620	So, awesome.
2726620	2729620	Sorry, I was distracted because they're telling Commodore 64 jokes in chat,
2729620	2735620	and that's just all kinds of awesome.
2735620	2736620	But not as awesome as-
2736620	2739620	I used to play kicks on an Apple IIe.
2739620	2743620	But look, Commodore 64 and Apple IIe, not nearly as awesome as boobs.
2743620	2744620	And that's what the next story is about.
2744620	2745620	It's about boobs.
2745620	2747620	Mine are pretty awesome.
2747620	2749620	We have to talk about boobs in Age of Conan.
2749620	2751620	Here's something kind of interesting.
2751620	2756620	Apparently what happened is that suddenly one day in Age of Conan,
2756620	2757620	all the boobs like disappeared.
2757620	2760620	Well, they didn't like disappear, but they got really tiny.
2760620	2762620	I guess all the boobs shrink.
2762620	2764620	They shrank.
2764620	2769620	Apparently what happened, code from an earlier patch actually went into a new patch,
2769620	2774620	and it caused the morph values for certain models in the game to become altered.
2774620	2778620	And the only thing that people seem to be noticing though are the boobs.
2778620	2780620	The boobs have their own value?
2780620	2781620	What?
2781620	2782620	That's awesome.
2782620	2786620	Apparently people notice, and they actually have before and after shots here on various websites.
2786620	2787620	Well, you know what that means.
2787620	2791620	If something can be shrunk, it can be made bigger.
2791620	2796620	This is what I love, is that the company actually posted a clarification saying,
2796620	2801620	quote, your breasts should be back to normal soon.
2801620	2805620	Well, thank you for saving the day.
2805620	2806620	Wow.
2806620	2810620	By the way, it should be noted, man boobs were not affected at all.
2810620	2811620	Wow.
2811620	2812620	Man boobs were safe.
2812620	2816620	Also safe this week, your emails, but not for much longer,
2816620	2818620	because we're about to turn Dark Sakura loose on them.
2818620	2820620	But not for very much longer?
2820620	2824620	Not for very much longer.
2824620	2827620	I've got to open the mailbag.
2827620	2829620	No, I am.
2829620	2833620	Mailbagorangelaungeradio.com, here we go, Dark Sakura, take it away.
2833620	2834620	Stuff.
2834620	2838620	This is the best, this is like my email of the week just because of how it ends.
2838620	2841620	Hey Rob and Dark Sakura, how goes it?
2841620	2842620	What about Loki?
2842620	2843620	Say hi to Loki too.
2843620	2844620	F Loki.
2844620	2849620	My name is Taibon and I'm currently living in Kenya with my sisters.
2849620	2852620	I'm sorry, I'm not going to think of power thirst.
2852620	2855620	The region here is really poor, but we're fortunate enough to be able to afford
2855620	2857620	and import video games from Europe.
2857620	2861620	We finally got hold of Grand Theft Auto and I've been enjoying it a lot.
2861620	2863620	I don't have much to say, just wanted to say hi
2863620	2866620	and let you guys know that you've got listeners all around the world.
2866620	2869620	I've been listening to the podcast every week for the past year now
2869620	2872620	and it's one of my favorites, Keep Up The Good Work, Taibon.
2872620	2878620	This message is brought to you by Samara's Cafe, home of the never-ending dirt.
2878620	2879620	That's what I thought was awesome.
2879620	2881620	P.S., hope you read my email on the show.
2881620	2882620	It'll definitely make my week.
2882620	2886620	Okay, look, I think you totally just got punked.
2886620	2887620	Here's the reason why.
2887620	2889620	Look, because I saw that email sitting in there.
2889620	2890620	Look at the sender name.
2890620	2893620	It does not match the person who says they are.
2893620	2894620	I know.
2894620	2902620	However, the reason why I thought it was awesome was because of the never-ending dirt.
2902620	2905620	I want this person to prove that they're actually in Kenya somehow.
2905620	2907620	Send us a picture of Kenya.
2907620	2910620	You need to be standing in front of a building flying the Kenya flag.
2910620	2911620	No.
2911620	2913620	Making a gang sign or something.
2913620	2914620	I don't know.
2914620	2915620	Making the OLR gang sign, whatever that is.
2915620	2917620	Take us a picture of Samara's Cafe.
2917620	2919620	Oh, yes, we want a picture of Samara's Cafe.
2919620	2920620	There you go.
2920620	2921620	Perfect.
2921620	2922620	Perfect.
2922620	2923620	And the never-ending dirt.
2923620	2924620	Yes.
2924620	2929620	But the other reason I'm thinking it's awesome is I'm also thinking of power thirst now.
2929620	2934620	And then I'm thinking, why would someone send us, and I apologize if we're not getting punked.
2934620	2936620	Just realize my suspicions.
2936620	2937620	A couple things about your email.
2937620	2939620	Raise some eyebrows.
2939620	2943620	Why would you punk us with that?
2943620	2945620	You crazy kids.
2945620	2947620	Well, I'm thinking that it could be a nickname too.
2947620	2950620	So I'm going to suspend, you know.
2950620	2951620	Well, that's right.
2951620	2954620	And I apologize profusely if you are the real deal.
2954620	2957620	If you are a legitimate person that lives in Kenya, you know what?
2957620	2960620	Actually, I'm going to save the email and I'm going to run it through an IP hunt.
2960620	2961620	Yeah.
2961620	2962620	Oh, there you go.
2962620	2963620	There you go.
2963620	2969620	Not that we are coming out and saying it was just that we never expected to get email from Kenya.
2969620	2973620	But then again, we have a caller who calls from...
2973620	2974620	We get Sweden.
2974620	2975620	We get Argentina.
2975620	2976620	We get...
2976620	2977620	Why not Kenya?
2977620	2978620	I know.
2978620	2979620	Why not?
2979620	2982620	I want somebody from Wales to call me so I can listen to a sexy Welsh accent.
2982620	2983620	Next email.
2983620	2984620	Okay.
2984620	2985620	Just a quick...
2985620	2987620	Okay, this is from Robert M.
2987620	2989620	Just a quick thought about the Wii storage.
2989620	2992620	In addition to download virtual console and WiiWare titles,
2992620	2995620	game saves seem to take a pretty big chunk of hard drive space.
2995620	3000620	Elibits, for instance, uses about 100 blocks and Brawl save files well over 120.
3000620	3003620	I assume that EA Sports games use large blocks as well,
3003620	3006620	as most likely will the upcoming Animal Crossing game,
3006620	3009620	the GameCube one actually fills an entire grey memory card
3009620	3012620	and comes with a spare card for that reason.
3012620	3019620	And if it's a game that uses WFC and you can't move the save to your SD card for backup,
3019620	3022620	I have no idea what should be done about...
3022620	3024620	I'm sorry, I have no idea what should be done about this.
3024620	3028620	How many free blocks does a clean Wii with nothing but the disc channel
3028620	3030620	and no game saves have anyway?
3030620	3035620	I have Mario Kart Wii from my Gamefly list and I haven't gotten online with it yet
3035620	3039620	since I've been busy with other things, mostly Dr. Mario Online RX.
3039620	3044620	So anyone there or in OLR me has a chance to compete in that one?
3047620	3049620	He has a good question. I'm actually not sure.
3049620	3053620	How many blocks come on a brand new Wii? Isn't it like 1400 about?
3053620	3054620	Maybe the chat room goes a little bit...
3054620	3057620	I don't know. I think blocks are stupid for measurement anyways on there.
3057620	3058620	True that.
3058620	3063620	Just fucking kilobytes, man. That's what everybody uses nowadays.
3063620	3065620	Megabytes.
3065620	3066620	Gigabyte?
3066620	3068620	You know, it's something that people can understand.
3068620	3071620	This game takes a terabyte of saving space.
3071620	3074620	Yeah, instead of Microsoft points and shit like that.
3074620	3075620	Well...
3075620	3076620	It's hard.
3076620	3078620	Anyway, next email.
3078620	3079620	Yes, Preeze?
3079620	3081620	Hey, DarkSakuraSky and Loki.
3081620	3082620	Hey.
3084620	3085620	I was just saying hey.
3085620	3086620	Hey.
3086620	3087620	Hey!
3087620	3091620	I'm a long time listener from Canada known as D.Vay in the chat room.
3091620	3092620	Hi.
3092620	3093620	Hey, Jamie.
3093620	3094620	What do gay horses eat?
3095620	3096620	Hey!
3099620	3101620	Okay, I'm not gonna do the other joke.
3102620	3103620	So yes, listener from Canada.
3103620	3104620	Okay.
3105620	3108620	I know Loki is all into PSP hacks and homebrew stuff like that,
3108620	3112620	but recently I just bought myself a DS with a flash cart that I ordered online.
3112620	3114620	You got a ninja pass!
3114620	3120620	Anyway, my question to Loki is have you experience with DS homebrew before or do you even give a shit?
3120620	3125620	And so do you have any good links that can guide me in the right passage?
3125620	3127620	Thanks guys for making my weekly days and...
3127620	3128620	Weekly days? Okay.
3128620	3129620	And keep up the good work.
3129620	3134620	By the way, I was gonna submit a GTA radio entry if it weren't for my MacBook crapping out on me.
3134620	3139620	This message has been brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending flow of saggy granny birthday parties.
3139620	3140620	Nice.
3141620	3142620	You know what? Fear not.
3142620	3143620	I'm still trying to get that Portal win.
3143620	3147620	I am told that All Games is going to be stepping up the number of contests that they do.
3147620	3151620	So there will be more opportunities to get in on the fun and big prizes eventually.
3151620	3157620	We should have like a best message brought to you by contest for our emails.
3157620	3160620	We do have some stuff to give away and I think we're gonna do it next week.
3160620	3161620	Okay.
3161620	3162620	I have an idea.
3162620	3165620	Okay. Uh-oh. Let's hide.
3165620	3174620	But no, I still meant to download Still Alive and my week has just been in utter chaos so I haven't had a chance to do it yet.
3174620	3182620	But I do have a Ninja Pass so as soon as I can find my SD card reader then I will be making use of the downloads and I will let you know what I think.
3182620	3187620	No, I plan on buying one of these. I'm poor right now so I can't.
3187620	3191620	So yeah, that's the only problem right now.
3191620	3198620	Oh, I know someone who does regular shipments of them because if you order like ten of them you get free shipping or something.
3198620	3200620	So next time this goes on I'll let you know.
3200620	3203620	Well, it still doesn't make me not poor.
3203620	3207620	But yeah, I plan on buying one because I mean they look cool.
3207620	3214620	My whole thing before was if I was ever going to buy one it was just to play import games on anyways.
3214620	3217620	Because I'm not going to buy every fucking import game out there.
3217620	3225620	In fact, most of the games I do play on my PSP that are not legit are just to try them out so I can talk about them on the show.
3225620	3230620	And I don't intend on keeping them because fuck, I don't play my PSP really right now anyways.
3230620	3233620	I just play more of my 360 and Grand Theft Auto.
3233620	3237620	But yeah, that's pretty much the only interest I have on that stuff.
3237620	3240620	So yeah, we for that matter play all import games sometimes.
3240620	3243620	I don't even really play that many import games.
3243620	3248620	Just mainly, well I play Mario Kart but that's not import so.
3248620	3249620	There you go.
3249620	3252620	Actually, I'm going to be importing a game.
3252620	3253620	What could that be?
3253620	3259620	Because I have a new 2DX controller. I'm actually thinking about importing Happy Sky.
3259620	3260620	Really?
3260620	3261620	Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
3261620	3268620	Because you know, I've been wanting to get back into playing 2DX because I used to, I wasn't nearly as good as you are but.
3268620	3270620	I was talking about that the other week actually.
3270620	3275620	But I've got, I can start, I actually have two of the same kind of controller now and can do double.
3275620	3277620	I've been trying to learn double.
3277620	3283620	You know I still have all those arcade parts that I remember how I was going to build the controllers for the 2DX and pop music and all that stuff.
3283620	3284620	Still have all those.
3284620	3287620	I would pay you to build me an arcade style controller.
3287620	3288620	For pop music?
3288620	3292620	No for, well for pop music yeah too because I have a bunch of pop music too.
3292620	3297620	I have the full size buttons for it. They're like 8 bucks each. Sucks.
3297620	3304620	Well, next email comes from one of our listeners in the UK.
3304620	3306620	Hi OLR, it's Guy.
3306620	3307620	Hi Guy.
3307620	3308620	Hi Guy.
3308620	3312620	I once sent you a letter regarding what time I could listen live to the show. I'm in the UK.
3312620	3318620	Now I'm back with another England slash America question. I want to know what the reception for GTA 4 was in America.
3318620	3323620	It was really hyped in England but everyone forgot about it when it came out because it was exactly the same as the others.
3323620	3330620	Was it the same in America? I'm sorry if it's been covered but I've had school exams and haven't listened to the cast recently.
3330620	3331620	Pip pip guy.
3331620	3333620	He said pip pip. That's cute.
3333620	3338620	Well we did kind of talk about it in part A that worldwide they've sold 8.5 million.
3338620	3341620	Was that worldwide or just here in America that they sold 8.5 million?
3341620	3342620	It was probably worldwide.
3342620	3343620	I think it's worldwide.
3343620	3351620	11 million have gone to store shelves so it's been doing very well and I would tend to once say the majority of that is happening in America.
3351620	3359620	And no I'm not really hearing a lot of it's too much like the others. I think honestly if it is too much like the others that's okay for a lot of people here.
3359620	3369620	Well honestly and you know me I wasn't at all interested in Grand Theft Auto 4 but Dan's been borrowing our friend George's copy for a while and he's been kind of getting into it.
3369620	3377620	You know actually doing the missions and his friend Will's been just you know fucking off on everything in that game and doing whatever the hell he wanted to and trying to get as drunk as possible.
3377620	3381620	He got so drunk on his character that he couldn't walk. I thought it was funny.
3381620	3388620	But anyway I've actually kind of gotten into watching them play it just because you know I like picking out stuff.
3388620	3391620	Like the piss water reference that cracked me the hell up.
3391620	3395620	Here's something else to consider. Grand Theft Auto has been selling systems here.
3395620	3396620	It has.
3396620	3403620	PlayStation 3's especially. I don't know if it's name recognition or what but there's a lot of people that have been picking up PS3's just for this game.
3403620	3405620	The Sony Grill.
3405620	3410620	And Blu-ray player too. They go oh it plays Blu-rays and Grand Theft Auto 1.
3410620	3411620	And it cooks burgers.
3411620	3412620	So there you go.
3412620	3414620	Thank you Guy.
3414620	3415620	Bye Guy.
3415620	3416620	Bye Guy.
3416620	3417620	Hey guys and girl.
3417620	3418620	Pip pip.
3418620	3422620	Thank you. I know I'm awesome. I get my own hello.
3422620	3426620	Anyway I have been listening for about four years. Oh God four years.
3426620	3429620	And I hardly ever email you but I thought this was worth it.
3429620	3435620	I work in an office job and often listen to music and one time I decided I should listen to your podcast at work.
3435620	3440620	It entertained me so well for the three hours that it makes the rest of the day pass by incredibly slowly.
3440620	3444620	Not just and not even my music is working anymore.
3444620	3448620	I have even dipped into some archives just to have something to listen to that good.
3448620	3453620	I tried a few other podcasts but nothing compared to keep up the good work. I love the tangents and never let them end.
3453620	3455620	Well you got a lot of them tonight.
3455620	3459620	Plus he has the best email ever.
3459620	3463620	And.
3463620	3467620	Sorry Jamie had to whisper that to me so we did not give out the poor guy's email address.
3467620	3469620	But that is a pretty radical.
3469620	3471620	That's hard core dude. Hard core.
3471620	3474620	Like Itagaki is probably going to kick your ass for taking that name.
3474620	3476620	He wants it.
3476620	3478620	He wants your email bad.
3478620	3481620	I got to say though we've actually kind of heard a lot about.
3481620	3485620	In fact when when because Part B has been kind of late the past two weeks and that's my fault.
3485620	3489620	And I've actually been kind of getting flack from the people who listen to us at work.
3489620	3492620	Like why weren't we up for them to listen to Thursday or Friday at work.
3492620	3497620	So I know there's a lot of people that use us to pass the day by at work and I really really apologize for that.
3497620	3500620	Of course we are only three hours of show a week.
3500620	3504620	You know hopefully maybe one day we'll be able to put out a little more other specials and things.
3504620	3509620	But if you're looking for other shows that are quality check out our family at all games dot com.
3509620	3511620	There's some great shows there. Will you like all of them.
3511620	3515620	Probably not because the shows all talk about different types of games.
3515620	3517620	You know and there's.
3517620	3522620	But that's kind of what makes the network cool is that you have different gamer bases talking about all different types of things.
3522620	3525620	There's bound to be at least one other show on there you're like.
3525620	3528620	What were you laughing at Loki.
3528620	3529620	Nothing.
3529620	3531620	What is this.
3531620	3534620	Read an email dark soccer I have to spy on Loki and see what he's watching.
3534620	3539620	I do want to thank Rob with two B's who sent us presents.
3539620	3541620	For our sixth anniversary.
3541620	3549620	And I will check them out in a bit but I wanted to thank you very much for sending us your my cook rewards.
3549620	3551620	Yes and I saw that too.
3551620	3556620	So big thank you. We will definitely figure out a way to work those in to our anniversary show.
3556620	3560620	Here's the thing he's watching that is really Tiger Claw was telling me about this before the show.
3560620	3565620	But someone has done a shot for shot remake of the introduction to the naked gun.
3565620	3571620	But in Grand Theft Auto 4 using the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine they have recreated the intro to the naked gun.
3571620	3573620	And Loki's laughing his ass off.
3573620	3576620	I'm going to have to look for that when I get home Tiger Claw give you the link.
3576620	3579620	Just Tiger Claw send it to the mailbag.
3579620	3581620	So Jamie can look it up at home.
3581620	3582620	Thanks.
3582620	3593620	Hey guys I'm about to get a 360.
3593620	3598620	If I like first person shooters what would I get except for the obvious ones.
3598620	3601620	Any other game recommendations will be thanked.
3601620	3602620	Thanks.
3602620	3603620	Keep up the great work.
3603620	3605620	I'm sorry what system was it.
3605620	3606620	360.
3606620	3608620	360 first person shooters.
3608620	3610620	Call of Duty 4.
3610620	3616620	I don't know you kind of when you say besides the obvious ones.
3616620	3618620	Well the obvious ones are the good ones usually.
3618620	3619620	That's why they're kind of obvious.
3619620	3621620	So you kind of I don't know.
3621620	3624620	I guess you know you're probably asking the wrong people.
3624620	3628620	Because I don't think a lot of us are super into first person shooters as much as we are say RPGs and adventure games.
3628620	3630620	I'm really not myself.
3630620	3632620	But I will say this orange box.
3632620	3636620	If you overlook that some great first for not just portal but half life.
3636620	3637620	Half Life 2.
3637620	3639620	Half Life 2 is freaking great.
3639620	3640620	It's like the best first person shooter deal.
3640620	3642620	It's a better deal than Halo.
3642620	3643620	Because Halo is just one game.
3643620	3645620	Orange box is like five.
3645620	3648620	Otherwise I know I might take a little flack for saying this.
3648620	3651620	And it's not really for hardcore first person players.
3651620	3652620	But I liked Prey.
3652620	3654620	There was a lot about Prey I liked.
3654620	3655620	Sauce is Iron Man.
3655620	3656620	And I think.
3656620	3657620	Okay.
3657620	3662620	I think one reason that I liked Prey was that since you couldn't really die in it.
3662620	3664620	Like it was kind of a first person shooter for dummies.
3664620	3667620	The only problem with Prey is that it ended a little early.
3667620	3669620	But the music was awesome because it's.
3669620	3670620	What's his name?
3670620	3671620	Jeremy Sole.
3671620	3672620	Sole or something like that.
3672620	3673620	Jeremy Sole.
3673620	3675620	The same guy who did the music for Oblivion.
3675620	3676620	Did the music for Prey.
3676620	3677620	The music is great.
3677620	3679620	And it's like ten bucks probably at this point.
3679620	3680620	So.
3680620	3681620	Okay.
3681620	3682620	There's my recommendation I guess.
3682620	3690620	Well I was checking this and I think that it's because the Kenya email was a Gmail account.
3690620	3693620	It's reading an America IP.
3693620	3695620	Mm hmm.
3695620	3700620	But Google is international and they do run out of the United States.
3700620	3701620	So.
3701620	3702620	We'll see.
3702620	3703620	Send us a picture.
3703620	3705620	We're waiting for the picture of the cafe.
3705620	3706620	Or either.
3706620	3707620	Look.
3707620	3710620	Either send us a picture of the cafe or fess up that you were fake.
3710620	3711620	And just tell us why.
3711620	3713620	I mean we don't care at this point.
3713620	3714620	We read the email.
3714620	3715620	But I've got to know why that.
3715620	3717620	Why did she have to read that.
3717620	3718620	I mean was it a dare.
3718620	3719620	I don't get it.
3719620	3720620	All right.
3720620	3721620	Anything else?
3721620	3724620	I'm checking the inbox to see if we got it right.
3724620	3725620	No but we did get one.
3725620	3726620	This is pokey man's.
3726620	3727620	I'm going to read next week.
3727620	3728620	All right.
3728620	3730620	So tune in next week for more mailbag.
3730620	3734620	Hey speaking of interactivity the Skype line will be open very soon but we got two more
3734620	3737620	stories for you before you get the Skype line which we're kind of keeping short tonight
3737620	3740620	we're trying to keep our show a little short tonight because we've got other things we
3740620	3744620	got to get to for tomorrow but we will get at least a couple of calls in after these
3744620	3745620	two quick stories looking.
3745620	3748620	Well home is coming out this year.
3748620	3751620	So says Sony.
3751620	3753620	But.
3753620	3759620	They say now it's going to be released in the fall as an open open working beta.
3759620	3763620	I guess that's a fancy way of saying well it's not really done yet but we're releasing
3763620	3765620	it anyways.
3765620	3768620	Really when they think about it I guess it's kind of like every single game that comes
3768620	3769620	out nowadays anyway.
3769620	3773620	Well also you know there's a lot of pretty much anything Google does and Google launches
3773620	3778620	is a beta you know so is it kind of like that thing where it's like well we're launching
3778620	3782620	this and it's going to have all these awesome features but don't blame us if it sucks because
3782620	3783620	it's a beta.
3783620	3787620	No I don't think so that that's that may work for Google because they're always improving
3787620	3789620	their services and stuff.
3789620	3793620	When it comes to a game company it means we're not done yet but we need to release this
3793620	3797620	otherwise you're going to get really pissed off at us anyways because I mean same with
3797620	3803620	games you know there is a big story going out about grid for the Xbox 360 having horrible
3803620	3804620	freezing issues.
3804620	3808620	Oops we didn't finish it so now we got to finish on the back end.
3808620	3812620	I mean that's what it all comes down to anyways because they need to get it out you know as
3812620	3818620	soon as possible to meet their marketing campaign or whatever whatever at least it's coming
3818620	3822620	out I guess and either way people have been playing it in beta.
3822620	3826620	I don't know I don't to be honest I don't think home is going to be as big as they're
3826620	3827620	hoping it's going to be.
3827620	3831620	I think people are going to find it as being a big waste of time.
3831620	3835620	But we'll see.
3835620	3839620	Sorry for the dead air there I was typing some things in chat real quick.
3839620	3840620	He was typing of the dead.
3840620	3842620	Yes I was typing of the dead and I won.
3842620	3844620	I got a hundred percent.
3844620	3850620	Resident Evil 5 you know they've kind of been accused of being a racist and so on.
3850620	3853620	I don't know if you heard about that but you know because in the trailers and stuff you
3853620	3854620	know whatever.
3854620	3859620	But here's the thing is that the producer of Resident Evil 5 Jun Takushi has actually
3859620	3863620	denied saying there is nothing racist about this game you all are just misunderstanding
3863620	3867620	the original trailer which I would believe because people are too freaking sensitive
3867620	3868620	nowadays.
3868620	3869620	Come on.
3869620	3872620	Anybody can be a zombie regardless of race.
3872620	3873620	Can we all agree on that.
3873620	3874620	I agree.
3874620	3875620	Oh go ahead.
3875620	3879620	The very first Resident Evil had zombies of all.
3879620	3884620	By the time they all grayed out they look the same anyway so it doesn't matter.
3884620	3890620	You know they had to edit the US one because of the zombie biting the head off of some
3890620	3892620	guy who looked like Michael Jordan.
3892620	3893620	What?
3893620	3894620	Yeah.
3894620	3899620	In the Japanese biohazard when you go you know when you go in the room and you get the
3899620	3902620	I hope this is not Chris's bloodline and everything.
3902620	3904620	And so you go into the other room.
3904620	3909620	There's a zombie chewing off the neck of one of the team members who had been in there
3909620	3912620	before and his head pops off and rolls off.
3912620	3914620	And it looks like Michael Jordan.
3914620	3916620	They were supposed to.
3916620	3923620	And however PS1 graphics did they cut that out on the US version in that in that cinematic.
3923620	3928620	They also cut out the part with with Chris lighting up a cigarette you know with this
3928620	3934620	huge lighter which I've got a Japanese version of biohazard.
3934620	3937620	So it's not no big freakin deal.
3937620	3941620	But I thought that that was you know it's the same thing.
3941620	3945620	Well I mean speaking of like characters and stuff there are going to be there is a new
3945620	3949620	character in the game who is a black female is going to have a role in Resident Evil 5
3949620	3951620	is somebody you can actually include.
3951620	3955620	And see here's the thing is that the question was asked did you put this character in because
3955620	3959620	of the fact that you know the trailer showed that you're you know blowing up people in
3959620	3961620	Africa and that they're all the zombies and stuff.
3961620	3965620	And to go she said no she's pretty much been there in the beginning.
3965620	3968620	In terms of the reaction we're in the business of entertainment.
3968620	3971620	We didn't set out to make a racist game or a political statement.
3971620	3977620	We did feel there was a misunderstanding about the initial trailer which probably was just
3977620	3981620	some people being a little bit oversensitive I think because you know anybody can be a
3981620	3986620	zombie right.
3986620	3988620	We don't see a lot of fat zombies in Resident Evil do you.
3988620	3989620	Yes you do.
3989620	3990620	Do you.
3990620	3998620	There was a cop in the first one who died and then he came back as a fat zombie.
3998620	4000620	OK.
4000620	4003620	I know my video game trivia.
4003620	4004620	All right.
4004620	4005620	All right.
4005620	4009620	We're going to go to the Skype line here one eight seven seven game O.L.R.
4009620	4013620	But first I'm told that there is a very important voicemail we're supposed to play that was
4013620	4015620	left in the box last night.
4015620	4018620	And I'm just thinking about what goes on Saturday overnight.
4018620	4022620	No I'm thinking about things that go on on all games radio on Saturday night.
4022620	4027620	And I'm a little bit worried about this one so I'm going to go play this voicemail and
4027620	4030620	kind of hope that it's not too strange.
4030620	4034620	We'll see.
4034620	4062620	It's downloading.
4062620	4065620	I remember that.
4065620	4067620	That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.
4067620	4069620	I remember that commercial.
4069620	4071620	That's 30 seconds of all your lives you'll never get back either.
4071620	4075620	Well every second of your life is a second you'll never get back.
4075620	4079620	Tiger Claw says we just got bucket rolled.
4079620	4080620	What the crap.
4080620	4083620	Is that the new thing now.
4083620	4085620	Is that replaced Rick rolling.
4085620	4086620	By the way.
4086620	4089620	By the way I went to a sushi restaurant last night.
4089620	4092620	My friend Jim is his birthday is turning 30.
4092620	4093620	Happy birthday Jim if you're listening.
4093620	4094620	Here's the thing.
4094620	4099620	They actually have a sushi roll called the Rick O roll.
4099620	4102620	Can you believe that they actually now have sushi called the Rick roll.
4102620	4104620	Did you get a.
4104620	4105620	Screw all of you.
4105620	4110620	Don't they have Ricky O as like a Asian kung fu.
4110620	4111620	I don't know.
4111620	4112620	But I just.
4112620	4115620	But of course the whole table looked at it went ha ha ha Rick roll ha ha ha.
4115620	4118620	And I was just like Rick rolls need to die in a boat fire.
4118620	4120620	Underwater one thing.
4120620	4121620	All right.
4121620	4122620	We got calls.
4122620	4123620	We got calls.
4123620	4124620	Let's go to the Skype line.
4124620	4125620	Hi you're on orange on radio.
4125620	4126620	Who's this.
4126620	4127620	Ravens dolphin.
4127620	4128620	Long time no here.
4128620	4130620	Well hello Ravens dolphin.
4130620	4134620	Damn it's been a long time since you've managed to be the first caller here on OLR.
4134620	4135620	What is on your mind.
4135620	4136620	My friend.
4136620	4138620	First off what the hell have you been up to.
4138620	4139620	Dead Pixel Live.
4139620	4140620	Oh yeah.
4140620	4142620	You do a show every day here on all games.
4142620	4143620	So you're like Monday through Thursday.
4143620	4144620	Right.
4144620	4145620	Yep.
4145620	4146620	It's close enough to be in every day.
4146620	4147620	How do you guys go.
4147620	4148620	How long is that show.
4148620	4151620	Two and a half hours after all games interactive.
4151620	4154620	What in God's name do you talk about for two and a half hours every day.
4154620	4156620	Whatever the hell we talk about.
4156620	4158620	Sometimes we can talk about car chases.
4158620	4160620	Sometimes we can talk about we fit.
4160620	4162620	It's just a potpourri of whatever.
4162620	4163620	All right.
4163620	4164620	Well there you have it here on all games radio.
4164620	4165620	What time do you start.
4165620	4167620	You just start whenever all games finishes.
4167620	4168620	Yeah.
4168620	4169620	Whenever they reach at and they said all right.
4169620	4172620	They pull the plug and then we start with our.
4172620	4174620	The other host is Derek H.
4174620	4175620	Very cool.
4175620	4177620	I don't think Derek H. likes our show though.
4177620	4179620	Which makes me a sad panda.
4179620	4180620	Don't worry.
4180620	4181620	One half does.
4181620	4182620	Why doesn't he love me.
4182620	4185620	I want to know why doesn't Derek H. love me.
4185620	4186620	I don't know.
4186620	4188620	My fault.
4188620	4189620	I love him.
4189620	4190620	You pass along that message.
4190620	4191620	We here at O.L.R.
4191620	4193620	We love Derek and we we we hope that that love is reciprocated.
4193620	4194620	All right.
4194620	4196620	Would you call in to talk to us about tonight.
4196620	4197620	Do things.
4197620	4198620	Yeah.
4198620	4200620	It's about Microsoft and the blue ray thing.
4200620	4202620	I think it's dumb.
4202620	4203620	Why is it dumb.
4203620	4204620	Do you think.
4204620	4205620	Do you think it's B.S.
4205620	4207620	Or do you think the idea itself is dumb.
4207620	4209620	I just think it's dumb in general.
4209620	4211620	It's like it was like hey MGS4 is coming.
4211620	4214620	It's like we must combat it with a blue ray player.
4214620	4221620	Just feels like like it just shouldn't be necessary to the Xbox 720.
4221620	4226620	Yes and no because right now you know why why are a lot of people buying PlayStation
4226620	4227620	threes right now.
4227620	4231620	I kind of said this earlier in the show because it plays Grand Theft Auto 4 and blue rays
4231620	4235620	Xbox 360 only plays Grand Theft Auto 4 right now it's not really a movie system you know
4235620	4238620	yay DVDs but everybody has a freaking DVD player at this point right.
4238620	4244620	Not a lot of people have that in their systems and people I think the normal average Joe
4244620	4249620	I'm not a gamer but I enjoy the occasional violent video game right.
4249620	4254620	They don't know about all this like download exclusive Xbox 360 stuff.
4254620	4256620	They don't know about all that stuff.
4256620	4259620	They just think it's the same damn game.
4259620	4260620	I agree.
4260620	4263620	So I you know just something to consider.
4263620	4268620	I just I agree with Loki with he said if they bundle like a new one in I feel like that's
4268620	4269620	suicide.
4269620	4271620	That'll confuse some people.
4271620	4275620	You mean actually actually putting a blue ray player as like in the system itself.
4275620	4278620	Yeah I feel like that's suicide.
4278620	4280620	I don't the only time I would see that happening is the holidays.
4280620	4285620	I don't know why but isn't it ironic because don't they have to pay money to Sony for each
4285620	4289620	one of these because you know blue rays like a trademark of Sony.
4289620	4292620	You know at this point I think Microsoft will pay it.
4292620	4295620	It's just weird.
4295620	4296620	It's some odd reason.
4296620	4297620	Yeah they already got a patent for this.
4297620	4302620	They're like hey we gave the blue ray thing and like people start freaking out.
4302620	4303620	All right.
4303620	4305620	Well what else did you want to call us about anything else on your mind tonight before
4305620	4307620	we go on.
4307620	4308620	Sure thing about Okami Wii.
4308620	4310620	I got that this week.
4310620	4311620	And what you think.
4311620	4312620	I like it.
4312620	4315620	It's just the only thing that reminds me of Rainbow Bright.
4315620	4316620	OK.
4316620	4318620	How does Okami remind you of Rainbow Bright.
4318620	4323620	Because Rainbow Bright it's all dark and gloomy and you have to fill the world with color.
4323620	4324620	And this is what the game does.
4324620	4326620	You fill the world with color.
4326620	4329620	Nice.
4329620	4331620	Does that.
4331620	4332620	What was it.
4332620	4333620	Who is the evil guy in Rainbow Bright.
4333620	4334620	I can't remember his name.
4334620	4336620	The murky murky murky.
4336620	4339620	Yeah I'm sorry I was seeing of the peculiar purple pie man.
4339620	4341620	Yeah I keep thinking strawberry shortcake.
4341620	4345620	Yeah they're so easy to get confused I guess.
4345620	4346620	All right.
4346620	4347620	Forget it.
4347620	4349620	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight.
4349620	4352620	Dead Pixel Live right after All Games Interactive.
4352620	4353620	Plug plug plug.
4353620	4354620	There you go.
4354620	4355620	Have a good one buddy.
4355620	4356620	Bye.
4356620	4357620	Somebody was looking for more podcasts.
4357620	4359620	Maybe Dead Pixel Live is up your alley.
4359620	4360620	All right.
4360620	4363620	If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4363620	4366620	Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
4366620	4369620	SSJ100Matt said wow Raven I never thought about it that way.
4369620	4372620	Who knew that Raven's Dolphin could give such insight here on this program.
4372620	4373620	Let's see if our next caller does.
4373620	4374620	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4374620	4375620	Who's this.
4375620	4377620	Hi this is Spazinator.
4377620	4379620	I'm sorry.
4379620	4380620	Your name is what?
4380620	4381620	Spazinator.
4381620	4382620	Spazinator.
4382620	4385620	You need to go buy it on the PlayStation Network.
4385620	4386620	Awesome.
4386620	4388620	Well what's on your mind Spazinator?
4388620	4390620	Yeah a couple things.
4390620	4396620	Much of which you kind of sort of touch on on tonight's show especially in part 1.
4396620	4400620	Now I do have one concern about full caliber 4.
4400620	4403620	Which is going to be coming out next month.
4403620	4408620	Especially with all the characters from Star Wars and what not.
4408620	4414620	If you think about it you know how at least in all the Star Wars movies supposedly the
4414620	4419620	light sabers pretty much cut through like 99% of everything out there.
4419620	4420620	Right.
4420620	4424620	Like limbs and walls and stuff like that.
4424620	4432620	In theory if they want the Star Wars characters in full caliber 4 to be like totally accurate
4432620	4436620	and what not wouldn't they be like way overpowered and what not.
4436620	4442620	You know like you know cut off people's legs and totally break down the characters weapons
4442620	4443620	and what not.
4443620	4448620	Well I think you know they're probably just going to balance it.
4448620	4450620	Just like you know when things have crossed over before.
4450620	4453620	Like you know when Spawn and Link and all those characters showed up before.
4453620	4455620	You know they just kind of made it work.
4455620	4456620	They just balanced it.
4456620	4458620	And that's just what they're going to do here.
4458620	4463620	And all these kind of crossover games I mean like Capcom versus X-Men.
4463620	4468620	I mean certainly super heroes would overpower these you know generic fighters right.
4468620	4469620	X-Men versus Street Fighter hardcore.
4469620	4472620	But they just make it work and they figure people are going to suspend disbelief.
4472620	4475620	And I think that's really what it's about is that you're just supposed to say you know
4475620	4479620	what I'm not going to pay attention to all this fact that the light sabers can like cut
4479620	4481620	people into a million pieces.
4481620	4485620	I'm just going to you know think how cool it is that I can play you know Soul Calibur
4485620	4489620	or I can play Darth Vader versus Yoshimitsu and all this stuff you know.
4489620	4490620	Oh yeah.
4490620	4493620	Yeah I have no doubt that the game is going to be good.
4493620	4499620	You know I'm kind of both a Soul Calibur fan and Star Wars nuts.
4499620	4504620	So you know that thought kind of crossed my mind like a week ago.
4504620	4508620	So you're okay with this because a lot of people in our chat room earlier were kind
4508620	4510620	of like oh why can't they just make Star Wars it's own game.
4510620	4512620	Why do they have to have all these Star Wars characters.
4512620	4516620	You're okay with both kind of living together in the same game.
4516620	4517620	Oh yeah.
4517620	4523620	You know it's just that little you know I hate to use the word but relatively minor
4523620	4527620	you know concerned with the balancing.
4527620	4530620	Tigerclaw made a very similar observation to what you're saying.
4530620	4533620	He says in chat here that's one of the things I noticed when I saw the gameplay footage
4533620	4534620	of Vader and Soul Calibur IV.
4534620	4537620	He can literally impale an opponent and throw them.
4537620	4541620	Normally a light saber would cut through someone effortlessly.
4541620	4542620	Oh yeah.
4542620	4544620	So there you have it.
4544620	4546620	It's a little wattage.
4546620	4549620	Now Spazinator do you think they ought to make a new Star Wars fighting game.
4549620	4553620	Like if this does really well do you think Namco needs to be paid like a lot of money
4553620	4555620	to like make a new Star Wars fighting game.
4555620	4557620	Like we'll just pretend the other one never happened.
4557620	4561620	Well actually now that you mention it.
4561620	4566620	I did buy the first one for the PlayStation 1 when it came out.
4566620	4572620	And I wouldn't necessarily say it was like horrible like E.T. for it's 2600 bad.
4572620	4577620	But it wasn't exactly game of the year like Final Fantasy 7 great either you know.
4577620	4580620	It was kind of like low low low for me.
4580620	4586620	So but I wouldn't necessarily you know be opposed to a new Star Wars fighting game though.
4586620	4590620	Hopefully this is Namco putting their feet in the water a little bit and seeing if it's possible.
4590620	4591620	I don't know.
4591620	4592620	I don't know.
4592620	4593620	We can hope.
4593620	4594620	Go ahead.
4594620	4595620	Oh go ahead.
4595620	4596620	Sorry.
4596620	4599620	I was just going to say is there anything else you want to talk about before we go Spazinator.
4599620	4600620	Yeah.
4600620	4605620	I know that you kind of got away from Final Fantasy 11 and more into WoW.
4605620	4609620	But that was notwithstanding.
4609620	4617620	Have you heard anything about like a fan festival like what they had in Anaheim last year.
4617620	4618620	I have not.
4618620	4622620	But from what I understand Squeenix usually announces those things pre last minute.
4622620	4626620	I mean not like you know the day before but they only give like two months notice.
4626620	4630620	Whereas with Blizzard you know they've already announced hey BlizzCon is going to happen mark the date.
4630620	4634620	And maybe it's because BlizzCon gets a hell of a lot more people not just because they have WoW.
4634620	4641620	They also have Starcraft and you know some of those other you know powerhouse games and Diablo 3 rumors are enough to get people to go to.
4641620	4644620	I haven't heard anything though even though I left Final Fantasy 11.
4644620	4650620	I do keep tabs on the news just to see if there's anything like really cool I'm missing out on.
4650620	4651620	You know I don't know.
4651620	4655620	I spent so much time with that freaking game you can't help but just kind of be curious about it.
4655620	4658620	It's almost like a bad relationship.
4658620	4662620	You can't help but wonder whatever happened to your ex.
4662620	4663620	You know what I mean.
4663620	4671620	Yeah honestly I've been playing the PlayStation 2 version of that game for two, two and a half years now and I'm practically addicted to it.
4671620	4674620	Even now that I got PlayStation 3.
4674620	4682620	And the reason I ask my question is in theory if they hold the Fan Festival this year.
4682620	4689620	You know this will be the first year I can actually afford to literally go across country and go to the Fan Festival.
4689620	4695620	And from what I've been told some of my friends are going to be over there and I've been just starting to go to the festival.
4695620	4700620	If they hold it in California I might actually try to go.
4700620	4705620	Because it might be a lot of fun especially if it's within driving distance because I think they had one of them in Santa Cruz and that's not that far.
4705620	4707620	So I could have gone to that.
4707620	4712620	But I just didn't know about it until after it already happened because it was when I was you know not really playing.
4712620	4717620	As a video game journalist to report on the event.
4717620	4721620	Well thanks for taking my call.
4721620	4722620	You are welcome.
4722620	4726620	We like hearing from people that we don't get to hear from very often so take care all right.
4726620	4732620	Oh I just saw something and then I'll let you go.
4732620	4738620	You know earlier in the show you were asking about that new Commando 3 game.
4738620	4745620	Yeah that's going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 next week and it's already out for the DS3.
4745620	4753620	Already got the game and I don't know if there's going to be a difference between the two versions but at least the PlayStation 3 game is pretty good.
4753620	4755620	Well that's a good sign.
4755620	4763620	So if you guys got the 360 or the PS3 I would seriously suggest investing the $10 for the game.
4763620	4769620	I will definitely check out the demo and see it's worth it because I am tempted by the beta of the new Street Fighter because I do heart Street Fighter.
4769620	4775620	But yeah I guess that's true it's already out on PS3 so it's good to know that the game is not bad so that you're not like wasting your $10.
4775620	4777620	But we'll see when that demo comes out.
4777620	4780620	All right well have a good one.
4780620	4783620	All right thanks spazzinator thanks for your call take care buddy.
4783620	4788620	All right we'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we're going to call it a night.
4788620	4790620	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
4790620	4793620	Oh wow it's Legend of Zaku.
4793620	4795620	Hey Legend of Zaku.
4795620	4797620	No show is complete without a call from Legend of Zaku.
4797620	4801620	Damn right it's been far too long what is on your mind Zaku?
4801620	4810620	Nothing much just basically just enjoying all my usual stuff you know games on my 360 like Grand Theft Auto 4 and whatnot.
4810620	4814620	That's right you upgraded to a 360 not too long ago huh?
4814620	4817620	Yeah it's been like about six months.
4817620	4819620	What kind of games you been playing?
4819620	4821620	Grand Theft Auto obviously.
4821620	4828620	I kicked the shit out of Call of Duty 4 on veterans so that boosted up my achievement scores.
4828620	4837620	But besides that I'm just you know just trying to scrap as many games as possible since you know money's kind of tight right now.
4837620	4842620	But you know it hasn't been so bad.
4842620	4846620	You know the new unlock code for DDR2 came out right?
4846620	4849620	I did hear something about that that there's some new unlocks.
4849620	4851620	Tell us about it since we haven't reported on it tonight.
4851620	4859620	I don't know it's like I spent the better part of Friday and Dave and Buster's trying to do that shit and we weren't able to.
4859620	4862620	Huh it has to be hooked up with the emus.
4862620	4864620	Are you sure?
4864620	4867620	Oh snap so can't.
4867620	4875620	Are you sure because that one actually was an unlock code in which you actually have to input certain you have to hit certain arrows after you enter your credit.
4875620	4879620	I still think it had to be hooked up the emus if I remember correctly.
4879620	4880620	Why is that?
4880620	4882620	I don't know why. I don't know why they have this kind of.
4882620	4884620	Does it download the songs or something?
4884620	4891620	I think it's because there was some other competition thing that went along with like some Zookan Battle 3 or 2 or something like that I don't know.
4891620	4898620	But from what I heard other machines besides the one in Illinois which is the only emus in the country managed to get the code.
4898620	4900620	Managed to get it working.
4900620	4902620	Well then your machine doesn't like you.
4902620	4905620	Well it just has shitty pads but that's besides the point.
4905620	4916620	Um yeah just looking through I don't know it's just been a rough you know down week for me I just haven't been playing as much because of other things.
4916620	4925620	But I do want to get you know hopefully get something from my PSP probably a bigger memory card so I can start like getting more stuff on that thing.
4925620	4934620	Hey quickly before we go since you still kind of follow the DDR scene and all that and we you know we try I still try to like load DDR Freak and look at the forums once in a while just keep tabs on what's going on.
4934620	4937620	There have been like tournaments or big things we ought to be looking forward to?
4937620	4941620	I maybe.
4941620	4946620	What about digital life? Usually you're calling in digital life, digital life is that happening this year?
4946620	4949620	It hasn't been confirmed yet that's the thing.
4949620	4958620	Until I get confirmation I'll let you know but right now I'm not going to jump the gun quickly when I can't really confirm.
4958620	4968620	You know the fact of the matter is I have to you know I keep tabs on the people that know and they'll let us know exactly when you know if and when it's happening this year.
4968620	4972620	We'll tell you when we're ready dang it that's what they're saying we'll tell you when we're ready.
4972620	4973620	Right.
4973620	4974620	Alright.
4974620	4978620	So I'm not that's it I'll let you know once I hear a word of it happening.
4978620	4984620	Alright sounds good buddy hey we got to wrap up and close the show you got any parting words for our listener tonight?
4984620	4986620	Listeners?
4986620	4988620	Just hack your PSP.
4988620	4989620	Hack your PSP.
4989620	4994620	Alright buddy have a good one.
4994620	4998620	That's some great final words hack your PSP it's awesome.
4998620	4999620	Alright we're going to do some quick.
4999620	5000620	This naked gun thing is great.
5000620	5002620	Did you check that out?
5002620	5003620	It's awesome.
5003620	5006620	Alright we're going to do some last minute stories we're actually going to start with Jamie tonight.
5006620	5023620	I just think that you know in He Who Shall Not Be Named more news about him is that he's been well it's not that it's official yet but it's been recommended for a ten year disbarment for his 27 misconduct charges.
5023620	5033620	Also it should be noted that two of his Supreme Court cases were actually dismissed with prejudice meaning he can't file it again.
5033620	5039620	So I'm hoping the judge says yes and goes for the ten years.
5039620	5042620	Again this is about He Who Shall Not Be Named.
5042620	5044620	Well he was very.
5044620	5046620	Oh yeah they wouldn't let him read his.
5046620	5053620	Ten years like long argument or whatever which pretty much called everyone a dumb ass and stuff like that.
5053620	5055620	Real class.
5055620	5061620	Yeah he won the judge didn't allow him to read and he had prepared in advance of course was like whatever dude.
5061620	5064620	So yeah.
5064620	5066620	He's I think I think it's going to go through.
5066620	5069620	Prepared my speech and why I'm awesome.
5069620	5071620	You want to read it.
5071620	5072620	Anyway.
5072620	5074620	All right.
5074620	5075620	You got something for us.
5075620	5078620	Yeah Loki what do you got.
5078620	5083620	Some stuff about Halo Wars coming from GamePro.
5083620	5096620	Apparently the latest issue had the exclusive and some magazine scans have already found their way onto the Internet and new things that we found out from it.
5096620	5098620	Basically the detail the current control scheme.
5098620	5111620	There is going to be some new UNC or UNSC vehicles including the vultures Cyclops and Cobras as well as mentions of like a campaign will be a combination of human and covenant worlds.
5111620	5115620	Also let's see here.
5115620	5122620	It's going to boast a six player Xbox Live multiplayer and feature two person online co-op.
5122620	5127620	And that's all in GamePro's July issue which should be out soon.
5127620	5133620	Also we were talking about movies earlier with Leonardo DiCaprio being in the Atari movie.
5133620	5151620	Well now there's another movie being made Kane and Lynch with Bruce Willis going to be starring in it as Kane Marcus or Adam Kane Marcus I guess which is weird because Billy Bob Thornton apparently is in talks for the role of Lynch.
5151620	5155620	So it's like that's going to be a classy movie.
5155620	5157620	I don't know we'll see.
5157620	5166620	Sony has apparently stopped production of a couple of games that they were showing off hell I think before the PS3 even came out including Eight Days and The Getaway.
5166620	5172620	Eight Days I believe was that one that they showed the demo for including all the bullets ripping up a car and that kind of stuff.
5172620	5175620	Oh well not coming out I guess.
5175620	5186620	The Bioshock movie which we talked about I believe last week has been confirmed of course as part of the conference call following Take Two's second quarter earnings.
5186620	5204620	They addressed the questions from different analysts about different topics and they also said that the Bioshock movie will be coming and that it's unlikely that the movie will be released alongside Bioshock 2 but it will probably make it for Bioshock 3.
5204620	5210620	So spoiler Bioshock 2 will be getting a sequel.
5210620	5212620	I don't know.
5212620	5216620	And then finally I forgot to talk about this earlier.
5216620	5219620	Rock Band the download content for this coming week.
5219620	5223620	They've got the MTV 2 pack which is going to feature.
5223620	5225620	Crap.
5225620	5226620	Yeah.
5226620	5228620	Moving to Seattle by the material.
5228620	5229620	I've never heard of them.
5229620	5231620	A Clean Shot by the Myriad.
5231620	5235620	Bullets and Guns by Them Terribles.
5235620	5241620	Those are each available for 80 Microsoft points or 240 points for the entire pack.
5241620	5248620	And finally an individual song Girls Who Play Guitars by Maximo Park.
5248620	5250620	For also 80 points.
5250620	5251620	All right.
5251620	5252620	Is that it for last minute stories.
5252620	5253620	That is it.
5253620	5254620	All right.
5254620	5255620	Well then that's going to wind down.
5255620	5257620	Oh and to answer a question you had.
5257620	5258620	Hey wait a minute you said OK.
5258620	5260620	Sorry this is answering questions it's not a story.
5260620	5261620	All right.
5261620	5265620	One block equals 128 kilobytes.
5265620	5266620	So if you do the math there.
5266620	5269620	I believe it's five.
5269620	5270620	Five hundred blocks.
5270620	5271620	I don't know.
5271620	5272620	All right.
5272620	5277620	Anyhow we're in wrap up the show now it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Laundry.
5277620	5280620	Oh but not before we get everybody's final thought.
5280620	5289620	I will start tonight with my final thought and my final thought is that these Haribo Happy Cola gummy candies that are like the little bottles of cola.
5289620	5290620	Are like the yummiest things in the world.
5290620	5292620	I love these things.
5292620	5293620	And they're not fat which is awesome.
5293620	5296620	Dark soccer your final thought.
5296620	5298620	I want food.
5298620	5299620	Real food.
5299620	5301620	The kind you can eat and digest.
5301620	5303620	Loki your final thought.
5303620	5305620	My final thought is.
5305620	5306620	God damn it.
5306620	5321620	I got to get a hundred percent on Grand Theft Auto IV. Like one. I have to basically unlock the special ability of Packy.
5321620	5324620	Basically when you get your friendship up a certain percentage.
5324620	5329620	He'll allow you to call him to give you cars with bombs in them.
5329620	5335620	And that will kick me over to a hundred percent and I get the achievement and I'm done with the story.
5335620	5339620	Cars with bombs awesome.
5339620	5340620	All right.
5340620	5342620	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry.
