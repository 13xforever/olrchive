449	5514	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5875	14723	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15284	19068	And now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19960	22302	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
43820	45761	immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.
45801	48182	So sometimes he runs long, sometimes he runs short, just depends.
48682	50743	But usually he can catch us around 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
50843	55604	Honestly, if you get here at like 4.45, there's a great block of programming on allgames.com.
55644	62827	It starts off with Kropotkin's UK Gaming News, moves on into the Bobby Blackwolf show, and ends with us, your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.
63327	71370	We're about to get into the gaming news here for Part B. I just wanted to say real quick, though, we got some guests coming up later this month.
71990	73952	I'm trying to arrange some interviews.
74032	76714	I don't have anything sealed yet, so I'll get back to you guys on that.
77034	83420	But in studio, one of our longtime OLR friends who hasn't been here in a long time is going to be back in two weeks.
83920	85942	Miklatov will be here visiting in two weeks.
86542	87303	So he'll be back on the program.
87323	89805	So I'll have to play high school musical stuff for him and get in the game.
89825	89885	Yes.
90385	92406	Maybe he can tell us what happened to Silent Hill Arcade.
92466	95806	He wanted to go to the whole happening thing that we were going to do.
95987	98667	I think I may postpone it a week so we can include him as well.
98807	99127	As well.
99587	100528	So, you know.
101348	105969	Because the happening, I think it's going to suck, but it'll be like a Lady in the Water.
106389	108670	We can either go all enjoy it or all make fun of it.
108830	113991	Well, since the chatters have no idea what you're talking about, you're trying to organize people to go see M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, right?
114031	114271	Yes.
114351	115112	I want to see it.
115912	117172	I haven't seen Lady in the Water.
117912	119753	Well, consider yourself lucky then.
120509	123693	But I liked The Village a lot.
123973	126576	I liked The Village too, and I thought people were really hard on that movie.
126636	128117	And I really liked The Sixth Sense.
128538	129439	I loved The Sixth Sense.
129579	132743	I even liked Unbreakable, but seriously, Lady in the Water was shit.
133807	140571	My problem with The Village, though, is they show you what the twist is, and then they're like, oh, pretend you didn't see that.
141391	142472	We're going to do the twist again.
142872	143453	Oh, just kidding.
143533	144733	It's actually what it was before.
145834	146774	That's my problem with it.
147175	148155	All right, so he'll be back.
148275	152718	I don't know if he can tell us anything about the latest and greatest at his video game employer.
153078	153758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
175916	176416	I'll be fun.
176496	180839	Because he doesn't really go ride roller coasters, but I told him he has to ride everything I want him to.
180919	181860	And he'll scream like a girl.
182200	187864	And we'll get YouTube to... Roller coasters are... I won't say great because I've only ever really been on one.
188904	189965	But the one I've been on is great.
191172	192933	California Screamin' California Screamin'
222133	222693	I don't remember.
223394	225314	That was a 3D ride.
225535	226735	No, it's not a 3D ride.
226815	227475	It's a video game.
229096	231317	It would cost you like three bucks to play.
233238	234058	I forget what it's called.
234118	234499	It's on Wikipedia.
234519	235699	It might have been since the last time I've been.
235719	236119	I haven't been.
236139	237720	Kadosho says Goose and Maverick?
238100	238420	Oh, no, no.
238561	239741	Sorry, that's a reference to Top Gun.
239901	241642	What the hell am I thinking?
241962	242402	Nice one.
243043	243783	It's something three.
243823	244763	I don't remember what it's called.
244923	245264	But anyways.
245844	247204	All right, let's get back into some gaming news.
247244	248245	Enough about our personal lives.
248805	249526	Let's talk gaming.
249946	250126	Yes.
250846	253427	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
271731	279500	and, um, it says apparently the integration with the MMO is going to affect, um, the stuff that happens on air.
279981	288571	So, for example, they gave, um, we can tell players that there'll be an alien invasion at a certain place in the game at a certain time and to be there, um,
290072	293014	All their friends and stuff would be ready at that time.
293395	298398	It says the outcome depends on them and then the battle will be part of the universe in the show.
298879	305644	So if they fail and they all die, then that will be reflected on the TV show, which I think is pretty cool.
306884	317592	It says both the show and the series will be set 80 to 100 years in the future and launched sometime sooner than summer of 2010.
319127	325649	When I read this or hear about it, I can't help but think, how awesome would the Battlestar Galactica game have been if it was this?
326249	326669	You know what I mean?
326869	329890	Like, that Battlestar Galactica thing they put on Xbox is, like, junk.
330250	334231	But there's a great game somewhere in the Battlestar Galactica universe.
334251	339312	And something like this is like an MMO where, you know, what happens in the show happens... That would be awesome!
339352	348474	I don't want to fuel the fanboy flames or anything, but wouldn't this be funny, just throwing it out there, if it was, like, say...
350071	359113	A relaunch of like Firefly or something like that, you know, and they have this whole universe that takes place at the same time and that kind of thing.
359873	360374	That'd be funny.
361414	367535	That would be kind of cool, but sadly I think the cast is all doing other stuff now, so I guess it could be like a new generation, but I don't know.
367555	372877	This doesn't seem like something that Josh Whedon would be all over, but you never know, I guess.
373137	373497	I doubt it.
373537	374677	It'd be probably something original.
375557	376138	Most likely.
376478	376998	Most likely.
378018	384982	Well, something else original and actually spotted in the wild this week, Duke Nukem Forever.
385082	385963	Yes, it exists.
386363	391666	It's out there, and you can actually see a little peek of it in this very strange place.
391706	401592	You would think if Duke Nukem Forever is going to launch its first footage ever, it's going to be like a one-up exclusive or a game trailer's hot spot.
401812	403394	The Office sort of shot the way The Office is
419273	420074	It's interesting.
420914	427358	But they kind of joke about Duke Nukem Forever, and it actually is Duke Nukem Forever that you see in the little show.
427699	438826	It's around the 4 minute and 15 second mark, and the most surprising thing about it, it actually looks kind of cool for that 30 seconds.
438906	440747	Hell of a way to hype something up, you know?
442128	442488	Hey, I...
444110	445271	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
467209	477337	But they're actually... What the focus of the show is supposed to be is on the people developing the games and not necessarily the games themselves and celebrities who play games and stuff like that.
477417	480299	So that's their kind of spin on things.
480319	483902	It's less about the games but more about the developers and people behind the stuff.
484203	489427	Is it one of those things... I didn't watch it, I'll be honest, because I didn't care about Duke Nukem Forever footage because nothing will match the original to me.
489747	492790	But was it one of those things where, like...
494313	501318	Um, it's kind of like self-parody, where you really kind of have to be in the know to understand the jokes, or was it really accessible to any people?
501338	501698	I don't think so.
501718	502619	It wasn't even really parody.
502719	504200	It was just an interview show.
504780	508503	They just shot it in the same way as you would shoot, like, The Office or something like that.
508603	522132	Like, lots of cuts, you know, lots of just, you know, cutting between perspectives and stuff like that, and just talking to people, and there was, you know, some goofy moments, but it was no different than, like, say, like, okay, I don't want to, you know...
522692	522992	All right.
537691	539212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
568837	569218	You know what?
569858	570478	Here's the thing.
571519	575161	Sega was grossly overlooked by a lot of people at the time it came out.
575482	583567	I think a lot of people, if they realized... If you knew then what you know now about the Dreamcast, I bet you it would have done a lot better.
584127	589991	So it's okay that we highlight a lot of those games because a lot of people didn't give them a first look the first time around.
590411	591392	So, whatever.
591832	592132	That's it.
592172	593673	Next week is another Dreamcast game.
593693	594214	Fine.
594554	594874	Fine.
597119	598641	It's going to be like Power Stone or something.
598801	600643	Dreamcast games until we get to half.
600844	602185	Power Stone was awesome, wasn't it?
602325	603327	Power Stone was kind of awesome.
603367	604869	I would approve of that, actually.
605369	608773	And you can use your save files from the Japanese version on the US version.
608793	610395	Alright, well keep it a surprise until next week.
610816	611957	I might do that, I don't know.
612758	614140	Meanwhile, more gaming news, yes?
614320	615021	Call of Duty 4!
617028	617969	Didn't that sound awesome?
618049	630176	Anyway, they're getting a variety pack for free for the PC version that's actually going to be offered as part of a deal with NVIDIA.
631216	635379	And it's coming two months after, of course, everyone got it on Xbox 360.
636439	638921	However, like I said, they don't have to pay for it.
640191	668373	um it's uh Creek in Chinatown are the um highlights there are um uh new arenas they're supposed to be um Kill House and Broadcast um and uh another one is a patch 1.6 that uh fixes a server crash exploit and a bunch of bugs so there you go hooray bug fixes yay bug report
670238	675180	Speaking of fixes and tweaks, there's going to be some new tweaks in line for Team Fortress 2.
675260	680282	The next class to be upgraded, I guess, would be the Pyro class.
681163	688045	They are giving them a brand new, I believe, an axe, which is going to be kind of neat.
689186	694588	Also, there are rumors that they're going to be introducing a sniper class as well.
695328	695609	So...
697284	697684	That's neat.
697784	703046	I like to see games that they kind of tweak them as things come out to improve them and make them a little bit better.
704166	707347	Unfortunately, I have not jumped on the bandwagon.
707367	709067	I haven't really played Team Fortress 2.
709688	714829	Just mainly because I like a little single player in my multiplayer games.
715309	716590	But that's just me.
718170	722891	Anyways, the new weapon, as I was saying, is called the Extinguisher.
723932	724072	And...
725635	726675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
749449	750291	Meet the Sniper?
750311	752193	I was thinking of that movie.
752594	753295	Meet the Parents.
753936	754717	Meet the Sniper.
754737	756239	They're doing it.
759959	785383	and maybe the sniper's already in the game maybe I'm just an idiot because like I said I don't play this game but um they are giving the sniper like an intro they they're doing like they did little intro videos for all the different classes that are in this game so they have um you know little funny videos that kind of explain what the you know class involves and that kind of thing you're not supposed to meet the sniper they're just supposed to shoot you in the face when you're not looking well yes you can actually be shot in the face and live
786405	792168	A good sniper would aim for the neck or the forehead.
797030	803753	Well, apparently a druid knew where to aim to kill Onyxia all by his little self.
804533	808175	Actually, it might have been a female druid that did this.
810219	810519	Let's see.
810620	813103	Yeah, it was a female druid, Sirenia, that did this.
813764	816047	Was it really a female druid or was it a guy playing a female druid?
816067	818270	Probably a guy playing a female druid just like I am.
818530	819071	Here's the deal.
819151	820813	Onyxia, if you're not in the WoW, no.
820853	823877	Onyxia used to be the boss of one of those 40-man raids.
824238	825119	You know, she
825219	825979	Thanks for watching!
848971	849371	Thanks for watching!
867268	871630	which is kind of a feat to kill what was once a 40-man boss all by your little self.
871690	872310	It's kind of cool.
872650	875071	And I've got to say, you guys have been listening to this show long enough.
875631	885555	You know that I'm getting more and more into WoW, and I've been experiencing the endgame content in it, which is kind of new for me because when I played Final Fantasy XI for all those years, I never got to endgame.
885835	889196	That was all a mystery for me, but now I'm actually running the 10s and the 25s.
889236	890516	We've been in Serpent Shrine Cavern.
890556	892717	We've been in Tempest Keep.
892817	894738	Now, granted, I haven't gotten to Sunwell yet, but you know,
895198	898441	I feel like I'm making a lot more progression in this game than I ever did with any other MMO.
898942	900003	It's been very interesting.
900363	903506	The social dynamics of it is just... These games are something else.
904146	904667	Something else.
904967	906748	I would love to guest on a WoW show, by the way.
907289	913054	If you know of a Warcraft podcast that needs the Rob Roberts perspective, I'd love to go visit someday.
914095	915336	Because WoW is fun to talk about.
916517	919700	I'm not going to beat you over the head with it here on this show.
921232	932081	Well, in more World of Warcraft news, there is a 27-year-old gamer who is now in deep caca.
933222	942169	He met this girl playing World of Warcraft, fell in internet love, and they ran away together.
943090	943830	Less than three forever.
943910	944331	Forever.
944773	946474	Now the girl is 14.
946574	947054	Dope.
948155	949396	Oopsie.
950557	953098	She said she was 18 online.
954359	958061	They were actually found in Franklin County, Washington in a campground.
960703	962204	Wait, in a campground?
962244	963224	Like a KOA?
965506	966266	Is that what it is?
966306	968768	This guy and the girl ran off together to a KOA?
968908	969548	They went camping.
970949	971590	They were camping.
972610	973451	Waiting for that spawn.
973611	973851	Anyway.
974625	975266	That was really good.
975286	975946	Wah, wah.
976527	977207	Boo.
978508	983012	But, yeah, that's just really sad.
983172	990097	I mean, but what really way is there to control if someone lies or not on the game, right?
991979	993180	Well, I don't think that they were lying.
993200	1000306	I think she was just touched in the head and, you know, decided, hey, I'm going to go meet this guy.
1000366	1001407	He seems really nice.
1001787	1003028	But, Mom, I'm in love.
1004477	1007718	Love does cause certain chemical reactions that have mimicked insanity.
1007958	1008658	I'm not joking.
1010998	1011379	I don't know.
1011439	1012199	I can see why he did that.
1012239	1012959	So what's the follow-up?
1012999	1014319	Is he in jail now or what happened?
1014619	1015279	Did they do it?
1016040	1016500	I don't know.
1017700	1018160	Let me see.
1021841	1022861	It actually doesn't say.
1022881	1024181	It just says he's in legal trouble.
1024521	1025021	Here we go.
1025041	1025802	He's in legal trouble.
1025822	1027282	He must have crossed the line.
1028228	1031831	There's likely... Which really running away together is kind of just cross the line.
1031871	1034012	None of that physical stuff really even needs to be involved.
1034352	1039195	Well, it doesn't say what exactly, but... It'll be some good old prison time coming his way, it says.
1039515	1041216	But he's, I think, out on parole right now.
1042757	1042977	Huh.
1043738	1045939	So... The question is, will she wait for him?
1046359	1049801	And M64 in chat changed his nickname to Chris Hansen and said, Hi there.
1050182	1051222	Why don't you have a seat right there?
1054444	1056946	Anyhow, now that's a dateline I'd like to see.
1058339	1059780	Catching the WoW Predators
1080182	1083104	You can't put a microwave next to your computer because it will interfere with your speakers.
1083925	1085206	You've got to put it a few feet away.
1085286	1087947	Bobby Blackwolf has an obvious point I didn't even think about.
1087987	1089569	He says he crossed state lines with a miner.
1089609	1090109	It's kidnapping.
1090329	1090990	Yeah.
1091810	1092791	So that's why he's in trouble.
1092811	1095773	He should have done his research first, dumbass.
1096093	1100256	There's campgrounds all over the place.
1100276	1101277	There's KOAs everywhere.
1101637	1104079	Frisbee says, what level did she say she was?
1104859	1105780	F.U.
1105840	1106200	of the Week
1147190	1148631	My FU of the week.
1149551	1158436	Well, really, I guess it's more, I guess, self-directed because I'm really nervous about something that's going to be going on tomorrow.
1159797	1160817	And I want it to go well.
1161818	1167961	And I don't want to do my nervous habit of talking, like, wildly while this is going on out of nerves.
1167981	1169942	So, FU to nerves.
1171041	1173944	Just out of concern for the listeners, though, it's not medical.
1174004	1177287	You're not in, like, any type of... I'm going in for a job interview, okay?
1177307	1180310	Well, I just want to clarify, people don't need to be worried about your health or anything.
1180350	1181011	You're fine there.
1181551	1187057	No, I don't have any type of degenerative diseases other than the walking pneumonia and the bogey-bogey flu.
1187997	1188318	Alright.
1189205	1190066	You didn't have to tell.
1190146	1190566	I'm sorry.
1190606	1192228	I just wanted to make sure listeners didn't get worried.
1192568	1201895	Loki, I guess F you to stupid workers at Roundtable for taking 40 minutes to make two-minute breadsticks.
1202976	1203576	What can I say?
1204137	1206098	I used to work there, so I know how long it takes.
1206699	1207760	It does not take 40 minutes.
1208700	1212023	And God, hire some more intelligent people for your front counters.
1212503	1213284	I hated that shit.
1215414	1217275	My FU of the week goes to my tooth.
1217335	1220017	I've been having all this pain in my mouth, one of my teeth.
1220077	1221978	I know it's probably got to have a root canal or something.
1222018	1224079	It's got to be a bad situation.
1224139	1225260	It's been hurting a lot.
1225280	1226901	I don't think I've ever had a tooth hurt this bad.
1226921	1229562	I'm like constantly having to take Tylenol or Advil or something.
1230083	1232644	And that means I'm actually going to have to go to the dentist on Monday.
1232664	1233565	Now here's the thing, you guys.
1234325	1236166	I don't like the dentist.
1236306	1238248	And a lot of people have those fears of the dentist.
1238268	1239869	It's not that I'm necessarily afraid of the dentist.
1240229	1243011	I just hate the dentist because dentists are like used car salesmen.
1243311	1244652	They try to sell you stuff you don't need.
1244692	1245252	I swear to God.
1245272	1246313	Not my dentist.
1246733	1247553	My last dentist.
1247593	1249335	Well, this is a true story about an experience I had with a dentist.
1249355	1250775	Maybe it's just HMO versus PPO.
1250835	1251896	Now that I have PPO, it'll be better.
1252276	1256939	But the last dentist I had tried to tell me I needed a replacement crown that was $1,200.
1258440	1263983	Now, granted, I did need the replacement crown, but what they neglected to tell me was that my plan would also cover a crown that was only $300.
1264583	1266784	So they were purposely trying to rip me off.
1267084	1271586	You know how, like, how much that turns me off to dentists in general?
1271846	1273947	Like, it makes me feel like I'm going to go buy a used car.
1274227	1281450	And I agree that, like, dental health is important, and I'm a fucking moron for not going to the dentist more often, but if that's the kind of treatment I'm going to get, do you understand why I don't like going?
1282391	1283791	Exactly, I totally understand.
1284712	1285152	Let's see it.
1286451	1287672	Well, I'll tell you later.
1288432	1291334	I told you earlier that I recommend my dentist to you.
1291354	1291835	Right.
1292255	1298899	They've never... And I haven't been to the dentist except for this one since I was in the third grade because we didn't have insurance for that.
1298939	1299560	We couldn't afford it.
1299720	1299880	Right.
1299920	1301000	I grew up Poe, okay?
1301561	1303182	Poe.
1304163	1304343	But...
1306999	1311424	The dentist that I go to, they give you cookies when you leave.
1312144	1313225	And they're good cookies.
1313405	1313986	How cute.
1314346	1317489	And the chairs, I fall asleep in their chairs.
1317509	1318330	They're memory foam.
1320252	1322674	And both of them are professional soothing.
1322694	1324095	Don't try to sell you shit you don't need.
1324335	1326137	They just put it out there and let you review it if you want it.
1327400	1328281	That's what I need.
1328321	1329061	That's what I need.
1329281	1334783	When I got all of my fillings done, they said, you have, here's a composite, here's this one, here's this one, here's this one.
1335284	1339505	This is what the pros and cons of this one are, this is the pros and cons of this one, this is the pros and cons of this one.
1339565	1339986	That's perfect.
1340026	1347629	Okay, if this, now see, I did end up, before Jamie knew I had problems, I just scheduled with somebody else, a co-worker recommended him, and he's like right around the corner, so, you know.
1348710	1354335	So I'm going to check it out and hope it's a little better because what I like about this is just one guy, his assistant, and the front desk lady.
1354996	1358340	It's not a big company, and those big companies tend to screw you more.
1358740	1364045	Well, also, this one's not a big one, and also if you go to my dentist, I get a $50 gift certificate for all of them.
1364145	1366128	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
1366228	1371353	But they do, because they're a small business, they offer perks to their clients.
1372696	1376337	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Rob, my dad wouldn't do that to you.
1376437	1379078	See, that's awesome that we know somebody whose dad's a dentist.
1379458	1382499	I would go to a family or friend dentist in a heartbeat.
1382640	1383320	I don't know any.
1383460	1387641	Unfortunately, SSJ100Matt's in New York City, and I can't exactly fly to New York to have my dental work done.
1388742	1389902	That's not very cost-effective.
1392270	1393571	That's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
1393691	1396073	Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
1396733	1397854	You know, and it doesn't really matter.
1398094	1402417	I mean, we're not that rich yet to where we can fly out to New York to get your dental work done.
1402437	1402977	Maybe someday.
1403377	1408341	When we are, you know, rich internet celebrities, I will totally fly out to New York just to see SSJ100Mad's dad.
1408521	1409061	Definitely.
1409141	1411923	At least I know I can, like, trust him, because Matt will put in a good word for me.
1412323	1415345	Well, I'm not sure if this guy's a rich internet celebrity.
1415385	1418047	I know he's probably a celebrity, at least in the gaming world.
1418087	1422110	But Nolan Bushnell, he has a biopic that's being made about him.
1422751	1428321	and, you know, must we forget that he also, you know, founded Chuck E. Cheese.
1428521	1430385	Wait, they're making a biopic about Nolan Bushnell?
1430545	1430805	Yes.
1431667	1432789	What's the story there?
1433786	1436008	Just the fact that he invented all these things.
1436729	1439432	The story is Chuck E. Cheese is fucking awesome.
1439772	1440934	Or was fucking awesome.
1440954	1442115	I stand corrected.
1442395	1443997	The pizza sucks ass.
1444618	1445178	It doesn't matter.
1445218	1446740	They had cool arcades at one time.
1446840	1447421	In the 80s.
1447461	1451445	I say one time because all those arcades have been replaced with neon lights and ticket redemption machines.
1451465	1452266	They had that Ferrari game.
1452306	1453207	That Ferrari game's cool.
1454150	1459215	Anyways, so apparently... Dude, I should have my 30th birthday at Chuck E. Cheese.
1459595	1460476	How awesome would that be?
1460496	1470646	Apparently Paramount Pictures has picked up the movie and Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be attached to star in the movie as Nolan Bushnell.
1472908	1474029	That's kind of weird in a way.
1474410	1475531	How does he look like?
1477287	1478148	Makeup, I don't know.
1478188	1480469	Wait, BlackWolf says, Sky, they won't let you.
1480870	1481630	They won't let me.
1482451	1482771	What?
1482891	1483652	They won't let me.
1484292	1485433	You're a paying customer.
1486194	1487735	They won't let me have my birthday party?
1488015	1489416	I've had some friends try.
1489456	1491458	They got kicked out because they have no kids.
1491758	1494580	That's, that, it's not racist, but it's ageist.
1494720	1495621	So, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1495681	1496261	It's because I'm gay.
1496281	1496882	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1497062	1497302	No.
1498243	1499224	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1499264	1499484	What?
1500104	1502246	Why don't we invite people we know who have children?
1504319	1506340	Don't tell them you're having your birthday party.
1532952	1536715	Vandalists in chat says, Incredible Pizza Factory is more fun anyway.
1536775	1538896	I don't know if he's talking about John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
1540397	1542238	Here's the thing with John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
1542338	1547162	I would agree that it's a pretty rad place and that the food is a slight step better.
1547442	1548022	Only slight.
1549483	1550304	But here's the thing.
1550544	1552025	There's no animatronic animals.
1552705	1553686	And for that, it fails.
1554026	1555848	We could put Loki in a teagle costume.
1557250	1558232	That might be a little better.
1558292	1559734	I'm not an animatronic animal.
1561637	1563319	But it's my birthday!
1563479	1564841	I don't give a shit.
1565522	1567024	Ranma makes the best suggestion ever.
1567806	1568006	What?
1569127	1569907	Dave and Busters.
1570528	1571328	Too far.
1572188	1572368	Too far.
1572388	1573309	I used to go every year.
1573449	1574029	I don't care.
1574189	1575230	I went to Disneyland last year.
1575450	1576690	I want to go to Disneyland for my birthday.
1576730	1577311	Oh my God, Rob.
1577331	1578011	Let's go to Disneyland.
1578331	1578711	Okay, wait.
1578751	1579892	Black will finish this story here.
1579932	1583193	I know this has nothing to do with games, but I don't care.
1583573	1585894	Adults wanting to go to Chuck E. Cheese is a very important topic.
1586535	1589496	I mean, my friends were just trying to go there for lunch one day.
1589576	1590236	Company outing.
1590496	1595979	They were stopped at the door and told that they weren't welcome because they might have overrun the place for the kids.
1596299	1598560	Dude, we went there in college once and they didn't say anything.
1598580	1598660	What?
1598840	1600220	We went there on a weeknight once in college.
1600240	1600861	You didn't say anything.
1600961	1603602	We've walked in the... Don't ask me why.
1603942	1610084	Back when QZAR was open, someone actually ordered pizza from Chuck E. Cheese because they had takeout also.
1611024	1611344	Why?
1612525	1613385	I don't know.
1613405	1616966	Who wakes up, mm-mm, I'm craving Chuck E. Cheese crapola pizza.
1616986	1621128	I think it was, mm-mm, I'm Poe.
1621188	1622088	I have to say this.
1622468	1624189	And by the way...
1627105	1633812	When I was in high school, after I graduated, we decided to all go to Chuck E. Cheese's and I got humped by the person playing Chuck E. Cheese.
1634873	1636255	But he was also my boyfriend at the time.
1636755	1637376	Oh, well, okay.
1638037	1638257	Ha!
1638517	1639699	You were in the furries!
1640179	1640500	No.
1640720	1642802	Oh my god, you had sex with Chuck E. Cheese.
1642882	1643983	No.
1644043	1644924	Furry lover!
1645525	1647227	It was silly.
1648388	1648869	But, um...
1649629	1662133	But, you know, we went in there and, you know, I had a bunch of my friends there and, you know, we ate shitty pizza and played skee-ball until we puked and it was fun and no one ever did shit about it.
1662193	1664254	CC's Pizza is an East Coast chain anyways.
1664734	1665494	There's a CC's.
1666234	1667855	Oh, Black Wolf is referencing CC's Pizza.
1667875	1668415	I've never heard of it.
1668635	1676822	They have this thing that's on TV, they're talking about a buffet and stuff, and it's like five bucks, and the pizza looks like it's worth every penny.
1677222	1679804	It's like $5 cardboard shit pizza.
1680845	1684208	DJ Morpheus says, there are times that Loki sounds like an animatronic animal.
1685148	1691854	I also have to say, Patty said in our chat room that she got kicked out of there when she was 18 and had a kid with her.
1692765	1696113	Alright, I have a better suggestion for you.
1696213	1697736	It's not quite Chuck E. Cheese.
1697756	1698418	It's not quite...
1699400	1700261	Go to Scandia.
1700421	1704844	Not the Scandia in Sacramento, but the Scandia more towards Vallejo.
1705884	1706725	That's where you need to go.
1706825	1708086	Because there's no water park.
1708206	1710147	There's no Super Ghetto Kids running around.
1710327	1713569	It's just arcade, go-karts, and golf.
1713649	1714870	Like God intended it.
1716291	1723236	And they have tons of SNK machines and the Taito games.
1723296	1723916	I've never set foot in there.
1723936	1725257	I drive by it every time I go to the bay.
1725277	1726178	Oh my God, they're great.
1726198	1726398	Yeah.
1727018	1729101	Is that what they actually advertise on the sign, Loki?
1729982	1732945	Arcade golf and go-karts the way God intended it.
1734006	1735148	That's the way it should be.
1736269	1736549	All right.
1736990	1738371	So what, Leonardo DiCaprio, what?
1738892	1740534	He's going to play against Nolan Bushnell.
1740854	1742796	I think the movie is actually entitled Atari.
1743617	1744058	Interesting.
1744799	1745059	All right.
1747843	1748843	Orange Lounge Foodio?
1748923	1750984	No, now it's like Orange Lounge Chuck E. Cheese-io.
1751764	1754685	Anyhow, let's go to... We were talking about games, okay?
1754965	1756506	Nolan Bushnell created Chuck E. Cheese.
1756546	1757606	We were talking about Chuck E. Cheese.
1757766	1758847	It's still relevant.
1758947	1762608	This is a topic that always comes up on our show, actually, is whatever happened to Awesome Arcades?
1763488	1763728	Right?
1764048	1764208	Exactly.
1764228	1764848	They're a myth.
1765248	1765509	Exactly.
1765549	1766789	They've fallen into obscurity.
1767129	1772071	Well, it's sad that our kids are only going to have to hear stories about the arcades.
1772991	1776112	It's going to make it sound like what our parents told us about the sock hop.
1776372	1776672	Woo-hoo!
1778203	1779604	I don't want to ever hear about the sock hop.
1780004	1780344	Alright.
1782866	1783967	Okay, no more tangents.
1784787	1785328	Are you sure?
1785648	1785988	One more?
1786328	1787389	You good for one more, Jamie?
1787849	1789090	Come on, Tangent Lounge Radio.
1791112	1792132	That was the ferret's tangent.
1792552	1793213	Continue!
1793873	1794954	You're withholding, I know it.
1795274	1795494	I am.
1795634	1797055	Alright, EverQuest.
1797176	1797916	These are good cashews.
1798016	1799177	Orange Lounge EverQuestio.
1799997	1801358	Here's the deal with EverQuest.
1802959	1806642	Sony Online Entertainment, also known as SOE, or as I call it, SOE,
1808490	1812554	So has reactivated all of the gone players.
1812594	1822424	Basically, if you abandoned EverQuest some time ago, So has reactivated your account for two free months for both EverQuest and EverQuest 2.
1823024	1824025	That is everybody.
1824245	1826708	So if you left the game, it's time to come back.
1827288	1827749	Here's the thing.
1828149	1832432	So also included all of EverQuest's expansions in those accounts.
1832852	1838636	And you get bonuses to help your players that are out of date get them up to speed.
1839496	1840577	So kind of interesting there.
1840637	1843879	It's called the Living Legacy campaign.
1843959	1846781	So it's basically a way to try to sucker people back into Evercrack.
1847322	1848642	Hey, it's two months for free.
1848682	1851304	Just take a break from World of Warcraft and go grief some people.
1851344	1851784	There you go.
1852045	1852265	Mm-hmm.
1853770	1854091	You know what?
1854131	1857734	EverQuest is one of those games I never really got into because I got into Final Fantasy XI instead.
1858014	1863799	Like about the time I would have gotten into EverQuest, somebody showed me Japanese Final Fantasy XI and I was like, ooh, I'm waiting for this.
1864780	1866702	It's Final Fantasy and it's online.
1866942	1867983	What more do you want?
1868043	1868884	Here's what I worry about.
1868944	1874549	Final Fantasy is going to do something like this in the future and I'm going to be like, kind of want... Final Fantasy XIV.
1874909	1877612	Kind of want... Actually, it'll be just Final Fantasy Online or something.
1877652	1877912	All right.
1879221	1879561	Anyhow.
1880322	1880722	Stuff.
1881262	1881483	Yes.
1882123	1882683	And nonsense.
1883504	1884745	Like this nonsense.
1884805	1885245	No, I'm kidding.
1885305	1886946	Can I read a comment from chat real quick?
1887006	1889528	I got to say it because it's about the arcade thing we were talking about.
1889548	1894731	Siren in chat says, I only hear stories about awesome arcades and it makes me cry that there are no more.
1895111	1906939	I guess we have to realize there actually are, you know, I don't want to say younger kids, but, you know, teenagers that are now teenagers that were like, you know, too young to remember when we were teenagers that are already going through this.
1907059	1907799	It kind of sucks.
1908120	1908400	Yeah.
1908420	1908500	Yeah.
1908780	1912515	They will never know how awesome it was to stand on a booster seat to play Crystal Castles
1913240	1917382	Well, it's like even when I was in high school, and I'm sorry for going off on another little thing.
1917402	1918022	That's what we do here.
1918042	1924844	But my little brother Matthew got hit by a car when he was six, and I was still a freshman in high school.
1925364	1936148	And I remember being dropped off at the mall to go see a movie with my friend Jennifer, and we went and hung out in the arcade for hours.
1936608	1937129	Exactly.
1937189	1939610	They used to have tilts in the malls and stuff like that.
1939650	1940550	Which is now a hot topic.
1941150	1944875	Well, Tilt got purchased by Namco.
1945396	1947618	I can tell you that because I worked for Namco Arcade when all this was going on.
1949200	1953866	But we had Aladdin's Castle and we actually got a cyber station later.
1953926	1958412	The Aladdin's Castle got turned into a cyber station and they opened an Aladdin's Castle in the mall across the street.
1959062	1959803	I worked at them both.
1960163	1965887	Anyway, that was actually right around the time that Arcade started sucking was when I quit working in one.
1965987	1969309	But anyway, I was there all day.
1969470	1970931	I was playing Samurai Shodown 2.
1971651	1974553	We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that day.
1975114	1975454	Rad.
1975994	1979437	Except that right when we beat the game, they freaking turned off the machine.
1980037	1980357	Fuckers.
1981078	1983219	Anyway, and these guys paid for me to play.
1983259	1985241	It was awesome because they wanted to do a four-person game.
1985281	1986302	They're like, here, we have money.
1986402	1986682	Okay.
1986922	1987863	They paid you to do a four-way?
1988483	1988923	Oh, baby.
1989404	1990944	I played Leonardo, so that's kind of cheating.
1991064	1992665	But anyway.
1993466	1995087	And I can't believe I still remember.
1995147	1999049	It's because my brother was injured that that really stuck out in my mind.
2000049	2002750	You know, we play air hockey.
2003730	2006431	Arcades, like only a few have air hockey anymore.
2006611	2007271	That is sad.
2007391	2008432	That is fucking criminal.
2008712	2012293	I mean, what arcade is perfect if you're not dodging air hockey pellets?
2012533	2021715	Speaking of perfect arcade, and I apologize for a moment to our international audience because this is a very local reference, but DJ Morpheus brought this up, and I have to know if Jamie's ever been here.
2021996	2024816	Did you ever go to Sam's Town in Cameron Park when it was up and running?
2025076	2025277	Oh, yeah.
2026597	2026717	Oh.
2027344	2029685	My God, that place was incredible.
2029785	2030846	Dan told me about the mineshaft.
2031666	2034208	Oh, that was, oh, I miss arcades.
2034468	2035749	He said that part of it was underground.
2036029	2038350	Yes, the mineshaft, it was a golf course.
2038510	2039611	The golf course started underground.
2039631	2041171	It was like a mineshaft and you would go upstairs.
2041232	2043052	It would go above ground after like the first three holes.
2043413	2044633	I've seen the remnants of it.
2044994	2049396	There was also, part of the arcade, there was a two-floor arcade.
2049776	2052297	Upstairs had all the little kids games like Noah's Ark and stuff.
2052317	2054999	And then downstairs, my God, they had everything.
2055539	2056440	Everything you can imagine.
2056460	2057181	Well, you know what, Arcade?
2057361	2061965	I think this is one of the last of the great arcades was the Birdcage Arcade that we had here.
2062465	2064827	Because the Birdcage... I'm sorry for people.
2064847	2065748	I know this is way out of that.
2065768	2069691	But this is where a lot of the new... We're having a moment, damn it.
2069832	2072053	Birdcage Arcade got all of the new fighting games.
2072374	2072774	All of them.
2072914	2074716	It didn't matter if they had to import them.
2074996	2075596	They got them.
2076577	2095373	and we actually well at the time and I'm not going to say his name because a lot of people in the DDR community especially doesn't but a friend of ours worked for Capcom for a while and it was funny watching him just completely hand people their asses one handed you know at any of the fighting games and it was just like
2096554	2114379	and that was like right when I first moved out here and then they started tearing down all the stuff that made the birdcage area cool like the theater where Rocky was and the arcade and they're trying to take out the element that was they said they're trying to make it safer for better clientele but in reality I think that it's hurt the business there
2114679	2115080	Outro Music
2136263	2136783	That's sad.
2137023	2137223	I know.
2158194	2159716	Sam's Town Old Person's Moment
2176246	2176526	All right.
2176806	2179568	No, it's just the fact that we had awesome shit and you don't.
2180109	2182330	Yes, we're reminiscing about better times, kids.
2183411	2183671	All right.
2183911	2186252	Except that I didn't walk to school both ways uphill.
2187313	2188254	So, whatever.
2188574	2188814	All right.
2189174	2189735	Sorry, Jamie.
2190115	2191276	You can do your story about... Oh, yeah.
2191296	2192376	It's a good story, right?
2192857	2193677	Strong bad!
2194238	2194538	Game.
2196840	2204983	The game is called Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People made by Telltale and it is going to be an episodic humor game but guess what?
2206363	2207143	It's delayed.
2208104	2213765	It's release has been pushed to July.
2214665	2221848	It says from the original release month into the next month so from June to July to polish it up a little bit.
2222808	2222888	Um
2225720	2255172	and uh I really want to play this game because it's awesome and I love the trailers for it but well it's obviously directed at me because it does say awesome people but here's this is attractive people here's the thing if you want to know a little well that's me too if you want to know a little more about the real insight to what's going on here listen to the very end of Bobby Blackwolf show this week when we're on I'm not going to spoil it but he gives a little more insight as to what could be possibly up with this delay so I'll leave you with that little teaser I will be sure to
2256289	2257632	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2267304	2272325	You and I. There was an interesting job posting over at Nintendo's official website.
2272966	2276887	The job posting was for a software hardware tester.
2277607	2284749	And their description of duties would be creating and executing a test plan for Wii's USB devices.
2285769	2291331	And it goes on saying writing, testing, documentation, whatever.
2291511	2294212	Anyways, but the whole fact is that
2295100	2297001	There's going to be Wii USB devices.
2298342	2299383	Storage, perhaps?
2299543	2300243	Hard drive?
2300604	2301424	OMG.
2302044	2302665	Maybe.
2304106	2305286	That would be smart.
2307468	2309329	Cross our fingers that that's what that actually means.
2310710	2311230	I hope so.
2312151	2316614	DMN in chat says, Sky is so old he owes Nolan Bushnell a quarter.
2317434	2317674	Nice.
2318275	2318595	Asshole.
2320276	2321737	Hey, DarkSakura, you know what else I miss?
2322697	2323318	Roller rinks.
2323338	2323398	Yes.
2324961	2330064	I've actually been to the one on Auburn, the Foothills Skating Rink, like in the last couple years.
2331205	2331725	I went there too.
2331785	2333146	And I'm still fucking awesome at it.
2334246	2335747	All right.
2335767	2337108	I'm not going to let this show get derailed.
2337128	2337688	I'm just kidding.
2338068	2340230	Rob and I are going to go roller skating next week and videotape it.
2340270	2341991	I almost played DDR on roller skates once.
2342311	2343471	I thought you didn't want to be on camera.
2343852	2344512	I won't be on camera.
2344532	2345332	I'll be videotaping it.
2346353	2346573	Fine.
2347053	2348474	I said I wanted to go ice skating, actually.
2348954	2349455	I've never been.
2349735	2349795	Oh.
2350120	2350982	I hate ice skating.
2351243	2351905	Must happen.
2352085	2352767	I love ice skating.
2352807	2353027	Anyway.
2354912	2355574	Rob's story.
2356469	2359770	Virtual Console, SNK, what more do you need to know?
2359970	2362910	There's lots of SNK stuff apparently heading to Virtual Console soon.
2363210	2371632	Not just Samurai Showdown, as you heard in Part A, but apparently Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury 2, Burning Fight, they are all apparently on their way to the Virtual Console.
2371672	2374333	This is the ESRB, of course, spilling all this.
2375113	2378033	Also on the list, Dig Dug is on the list.
2378073	2380934	Now that's probably not the arcade version, because you don't really see that on the Wii.
2381014	2385735	Probably the NES version, because it didn't really come out anywhere else that the Wii currently supports.
2386255	2398022	By the way, just so you know, also on the ESRB, it's completely unrelated, PlayStation 3, Ratings for the Last Guy, and Wipeout HD have both appeared, and hopefully that means that they are almost on their way.
2398623	2402325	So, we'll be looking forward to seeing those games soon, because Wipeout is kind of cool.
2403496	2407121	GameStop is going to be giving away a download of a free Pokemon app.
2419777	2428461	and forgive me if I mispronounce this but Deoxys which is a psychic type Pokemon that has four different forms.
2429361	2437625	If you've got Pokemon Diamond or Pearl you can go to a GameStop and download it and then they'll harass you about pre-ordering stuff.
2440126	2441527	But hey, you can have Pokemons.
2442067	2443528	I know, it looks freaking bizarre.
2444963	2452465	Very interesting comment from chat about kind of the tangent conversations we were having and it comes from Cyran who was kind of commenting earlier about being young and missing a lot of this.
2452825	2453745	Says something very interesting.
2454026	2456966	People Rob, Jamie, Matt's age had awesome arcades.
2457266	2462688	People in the 60s, my mom's generation, had Woodstock, The Beatles, The Summer of Love, and other cool things.
2463068	2467749	The majority of my generation just has the Iraq War, George Bush, and shitty music.
2468090	2472831	The otaku demographic at least has somewhat of a boom of the anime industry but that's about it.
2473820	2479123	That's a very, very good summary of it.
2479143	2479923	Here's the thing.
2479963	2485666	There's probably cool things about your generation, but you're not really going to realize them until like 20 years later.
2485946	2488727	That's the thing is that, you know, right now in this, you know, 2000s.
2488787	2490068	Did they ever come up with the name for this?
2490128	2490568	The O's?
2491008	2492189	The O-O's or whatever?
2492209	2492569	The O's.
2492889	2493310	The O's.
2493570	2493850	Okay.
2494090	2496491	Here in the O's, like the 80s are making a comeback.
2496531	2499112	Just like how in the 90s, the 70s are making a comeback.
2499413	2499973	Here's the thing.
2500433	2506375	When we start getting into the 10s, the 90s will make a comeback and all those things you forgot about will be cool again.
2506395	2510136	So then again it's going to be the late 60s, early 70s look again.
2510897	2511277	Perhaps.
2512477	2515758	You know, maybe in the 10s people are going to go back to the Victorian look.
2517319	2519980	Which people kind of did in the early 80s now that I think about it.
2520840	2521100	You know?
2522125	2522665	People in Europe?
2523266	2524627	Because if I'm correct, zero is referred to as aught.
2552116	2553057	Alright, whatever, whatever.
2555479	2556780	BlackWolf brings up a good point.
2557100	2570232	In 20 years, you may be telling young kids about how there was this internet where you could look up anything and read about anything and all information was equal, kind of referencing the net neutrality laws that are kind of making waves this week.
2572163	2572684	That's true.
2573124	2574845	You guys did grow up in the internet age.
2574885	2575525	That is something.
2575746	2577827	We didn't really have that when I was in early high school.
2577867	2580869	It was BBSs for life, bitch.
2581529	2589435	When we were some of these people's age, the internet actually was still military only and illegal for anyone else to network.
2589535	2591296	You totally just said when I was your age.
2595369	2599332	I mean, when we were little, it was true.
2599612	2605436	The internet's been in existence since, I do believe, 1972 or 74, around that time.
2605556	2606877	Whenever Al Gore invented it, right?
2607138	2607478	Whenever.
2608278	2616985	But it was military use only, and if anyone was caught networking in the early 80s or so, they actually could be arrested for it.
2617786	2617966	Hmm.
2618386	2628816	So, I remember my friend's dad, who's in his, I guess, 60s now, is an engineer, and he was talking about lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.
2630617	2632939	I thought that was pretty crazy.
2634080	2634741	But, yeah, anyway.
2635842	2637143	Just thought that might be a little perspective.
2637183	2638524	Lots of reminiscing tonight.
2639185	2640586	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
2640626	2641127	Sorry, kids.
2642130	2643031	Thanks for watching!
2665262	2671024	This year, though, I'm glad to see that it looks like around August they're going to be coming towards San Jose.
2671164	2673164	So we'll be able to hit that up, actually.
2673744	2685968	But, yeah, all over the place, including, you know, Canada, France, Scotland, United States, Portugal, and Brazil.
2686008	2686308	Brazil.
2687236	2693388	China, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Moscow, Russia, and Norway and Sweden.
2693528	2696514	So when they say world tour, they don't mean just like US and Canada.
2696554	2697817	They mean the freaking world.
2697957	2698137	Yes.
2698598	2699179	That's pretty cool.
2700168	2700849	I'll be fun to travel on.
2727085	2732672	Sorry, I was distracted because they're telling Commodore 64 jokes in chat and that's just all kinds of awesome.
2735716	2738620	But not as awesome as... Dude, I used to play Kix on an Apple IIe.
2740126	2741487	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2764352	2765232	The Boobs have their own value?
2782129	2786073	Apparently people noticed, and they actually have before and after shots here on various websites.
2786413	2787454	Well, you know what that means.
2787574	2790497	If something can be shrunk, it can be made bigger.
2792398	2799344	This is what I love, is that the company actually posted a clarification saying, quote, your breasts should be back to normal soon.
2802147	2804029	Well, thank you for saving the day.
2806371	2808853	By the way, it should be noted, man boobs were not affected at all.
2811169	2812250	Man boobs were safe.
2812851	2818735	Also safe this week, your emails, but not for much longer because we're about to turn DarkSakura loose on them.
2818795	2819835	Not for very much longer?
2820876	2822677	Not for very much longer.
2825299	2827761	I've got to open the mailbag.
2828221	2828761	No, I am.
2830120	2833843	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Here we go, DarkSakura, take it away.
2833883	2834303	Stuff.
2834964	2838126	This is the best, this is like my email of the week just because of how it ends.
2838907	2841068	Hey Rob and DarkSakura, how goes it?
2841489	2841949	What about Loki?
2841969	2842410	Fine, thanks.
2842430	2843290	Say hi to Loki too.
2843670	2844051	F Loki.
2844831	2847914	My name is Tybon and I'm currently living in Kenya with my sisters.
2849818	2851859	I'm sorry, I'm not going to think of Power Thirst.
2853079	2857341	The region here is really poor, but we're fortunate enough to be able to afford and import video games from Europe.
2857901	2861523	We finally got hold of Grand Theft Auto, and I've been enjoying it a lot.
2861963	2866685	I don't have much to say, just wanted to say hi and let you guys know that you've got listeners all around the world.
2867205	2870586	I've been listening to the podcast every week for the past year now, and it's one of my favorites.
2870626	2871367	Keep up the good work.
2871527	2871907	Tybon.
2872547	2876509	This message is brought to you by Samara's Cafe, home of the never-ending dirt.
2878799	2879699	That's what I thought was awesome.
2879960	2880220	P.S.
2880260	2881380	Hope you read my email on the show.
2881460	2882360	It'll definitely make my week.
2882620	2883081	Okay, look.
2883241	2884601	I think you totally just got punked.
2886522	2887282	Here's the reason why.
2887382	2889723	Because I saw that email sitting in there.
2889803	2890783	Look at the sender name.
2891023	2893244	It does not match the person who says they are.
2893904	2894144	I know.
2895145	2901247	However, the reason why I thought it was awesome was because of the never-ending dirt.
2902526	2904968	I want this person to prove that they're actually in Kenya.
2905428	2905868	Somehow.
2906109	2907109	Send us a picture of Kenya.
2907129	2910972	You need to be standing in front of a building, flying the Kenya flag.
2911232	2911732	No.
2912333	2913934	Making a gang sign or something.
2913974	2914334	I don't know.
2914374	2916196	Making the OLR gang sign, whatever that is.
2916216	2917897	Take us a picture of Samara's Cafe.
2918397	2920879	Oh yes, we want a picture of Samara's Cafe.
2921439	2921960	Perfect.
2922280	2923161	And the never-ending dirt.
2923441	2923701	Yes.
2925502	2929365	But I'm still now... The other reason I'm thinking it's awesome is I'm also thinking of Power Thirst now.
2930353	2935075	And then I'm thinking, why would someone send us... And I apologize if we're not getting punked.
2935095	2936536	Just realize my suspicions.
2936836	2938917	A couple things about your email raised some eyebrows.
2939798	2941298	Why would you punk us with that?
2944300	2945200	You crazy kids.
2945561	2948282	Well, I'm thinking that it could be a nickname too.
2948402	2949843	So I'm going to suspend...
2950959	2952040	All right, well, that's right.
2952140	2955063	And I apologize profusely if you are the real deal.
2955083	2958245	If you are a legitimate person that lives in Kenya, you know what?
2958546	2960687	Actually, I'm going to save the email and I'm going to run it through an IP hunt.
2961168	2962489	Yeah, oh, there you go.
2963370	2963790	There you go.
2964190	2966593	Not that we are coming out and saying it.
2966613	2968975	It's just that we never expected to get email from Kenya.
2971176	2977222	But then again, we have a caller who calls from... We get Sweden, we get Argentina, we get... Why not Kenya?
2977242	2977322	Yeah.
2978202	2978602	Why not?
2978923	2982530	But I want somebody from Wales to call me so I can listen to a sexy Welsh accent.
2982791	2983412	Next email.
2986479	2990201	This is from Robert M. Just a quick thought about the Wii storage.
2990261	2995765	In addition to download virtual console and WiiWare titles, game saves seem to take a pretty big chunk of hard drive space.
2996266	3000208	Elebits, for instance, uses about 100 blocks and Brawl save files well over 120.
3000789	3007173	I assume the EA Sports games use large blocks as well, as most likely will the upcoming Animal Crossing game.
3007193	3012257	The GameCube one actually fills an entire gray memory card and comes with a spare card for that reason.
3013764	3024952	If it's a game that uses WFC and you can't move the save to your SD card for backup, I have no idea what should be done about this.
3025252	3030816	How many free blocks does a clean Wii with nothing but the disc channel and no game saves have anyway?
3031656	3039859	I have Mario Kart Wii from my Gamefly list and I haven't gotten online with it yet since I've been busy with other things, mostly Dr. Mario Online RX.
3040799	3044820	So anyone there or in OL Army has a chance to compete in that one?
3048141	3048881	He asked a good question.
3048901	3049502	I'm actually not sure.
3049562	3051822	How many blocks come on a brand new Wii?
3051862	3053423	Isn't it like 1,400 about?
3053543	3054743	Maybe the chat room is a little better.
3054763	3055143	I don't know.
3055163	3057984	I think blocks are stupid for measurement anyways on there.
3058164	3058684	True that.
3058724	3060145	Just fucking...
3061192	3062192	Hey, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
3062292	3062393	Hey.
3062413	3062933	I was just saying hey.
3062953	3063133	Hey.
3063153	3063213	Hey!
3088137	3091481	I'm a long-time listener from Canada known as D-Vay in the chat room.
3092081	3092321	Hi.
3092622	3093042	Hey, Jamie.
3093523	3094424	What do gay horses eat?
3095585	3096346	Hey.
3099609	3099889	Okay.
3100090	3101151	I'm not going to do the other joke.
3102665	3103926	So yes, listener from Canada.
3105647	3112451	I know Loki is all into PSP hacks and homebrew stuff like that, but recently I just bought myself a DS with a flash cart that I ordered online.
3112692	3114193	You got a ninja pass!
3114353	3120677	Anyway, my question to Loki is, have you experienced with DS homebrew before or do you even give a shit?
3121337	3124880	And so do you have any good links that can guide me in the right passage?
3125680	3130148	Thanks guys for making my weekly days and keep up the good work.
3130268	3134376	By the way, I was going to submit a GTA Radio entry if it weren't for my MacBook crapping out on me.
3135057	3139044	This message has been brought to you by Olive Garden Home and the never-ending flow of saggy granny birthday parties.
3139972	3140292	Nice.
3141934	3142334	You know what?
3142455	3142715	Fear not.
3142735	3143936	I'm still trying to get that portal win.
3144156	3147560	I am told that all games is going to be stepping up the number of contests that they do.
3147960	3151844	So there will be more opportunities to get in on the fun and big prizes eventually.
3152084	3157470	We should have a best message brought to you by contest for our emails.
3157670	3161013	We do have some stuff to give away and I think we're going to do it next week.
3161394	3161614	Okay.
3162294	3162775	I have an idea.
3163658	3165019	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3189631	3191973	So yeah, that's the only problem right now.
3192273	3198316	Well, I know someone who does regular shipments of them, because if you order 10 of them, you get free shipping or something.
3198937	3201178	So next time this goes on, I'll let you know.
3201679	3203540	Well, it still doesn't make me not poor.
3204640	3208223	But yeah, I plan on buying one, because they look cool.
3208363	3214707	My whole thing before was, if I was ever going to buy one, it was just to play import games on anyways.
3215606	3216267	Thanks for watching!
3234941	3236902	That's pretty much the only interest I have on that stuff.
3237462	3238482	Team OE for that matter.
3238962	3240262	Play all import games sometimes.
3241023	3242563	I don't even really play that many import games.
3244003	3247604	Just mainly while I play Mario Kart, but that's not important.
3249185	3249605	There you go.
3250085	3251285	Actually, I'm going to be importing a game.
3252805	3253286	What could that be?
3254086	3258987	Because I have a new 2DX controller, I'm actually thinking about importing Happy Sky.
3259007	3259087	Okay.
3260239	3262701	I would pay you to build me an arcade style controller.
3287782	3288623	For poppin' music?
3288803	3292245	No, for... Well, for poppin' music, yeah, too, because I have a bunch of poppin' music, too.
3292585	3294226	I have the full-size buttons for it.
3294467	3295767	They're like eight bucks each.
3296748	3297088	Sucks.
3297309	3297529	Huh.
3298409	3304293	Well, next email comes from one of our listeners in the UK.
3304874	3306375	Hi, OLR, it's Guy.
3306395	3307495	Hi, Guy.
3307535	3307956	Hi, Guy.
3309079	3309419	That's cute.
3333877	3338819	Well, we did kind of talk about it in Part A that worldwide they've sold 8.5 million copies.
3338839	3342001	Was that worldwide or just here in America that they sold 8.5 million?
3342041	3342901	It was probably worldwide, right?
3342921	3343622	I think it's worldwide.
3343922	3345943	And 11 million have gone to store shelves.
3345983	3347063	So it's been doing very well.
3347143	3351705	And I would tend to once say the majority of that is happening in America.
3352125	3354987	And no, I'm not really hearing a lot of it's too much like the others.
3355487	3359429	I think, honestly, if it is too much like the others, that's okay for a lot of people here.
3360270	3364351	Well, honestly, and you know me, I wasn't at all interested in Grand Theft Auto 4.
3365311	3370112	But Dan's been borrowing our friend George's copy for a while, and he's been kind of getting into it.
3370512	3378094	Actually doing the missions, and his friend Will's been just fucking off on everything in that game and doing whatever the hell he wanted to and trying to get as drunk as possible.
3378334	3380575	He got so drunk on his character that he couldn't walk.
3381115	3381835	I thought it was funny.
3382515	3389078	But anyway, I've actually kind of gotten into watching them play it just because I like picking out stuff.
3389298	3391740	Like the Pisswater reference, that cracked me the hell up.
3392840	3393861	Here's something else to consider.
3394001	3395882	Grand Theft Auto has been selling systems here.
3396162	3396742	It has.
3397022	3398403	PlayStation 3s especially.
3399063	3403466	I don't know if it's name recognition or what, but there's a lot of people that have been picking out PS3s just for this game.
3404066	3404926	The Sony Grill.
3406427	3408248	And Blu-ray player too.
3408308	3410569	They go, ooh, it plays Blu-rays and Grand Theft Auto.
3410789	3411870	And Cook's Burgers.
3412495	3415997	so there you go thank you Guy bye Guy bye Guy
3417057	3418138	Hey guys, and girl.
3418958	3419318	Thank you.
3419719	3420919	I know, I'm awesome.
3421480	3422680	I get my own hello.
3423081	3425542	Anyway, I have been listening for about four years.
3425602	3426543	Oh God, four years.
3427483	3429925	And I hardly ever email you, but I thought this was worth it.
3430365	3435368	I work in an office job and often listen to music, and one time I decided I should listen to your podcast at work.
3435868	3444133	It entertained me so well for the three hours that it makes the rest of the day pass by incredibly slowly, and not even my music is working anymore.
3444793	3449058	I have even dipped into some archives just to have something to listen to that good.
3449238	3451281	I tried a few other podcasts, but nothing compared.
3451581	3452482	So keep up the good work.
3452582	3454324	I love the tangents, so never let them end.
3454564	3455826	Well, you got a lot of them tonight.
3455886	3456867	That's from Saltech.
3457648	3459070	Plus, he has the best email ever.
3460211	3460311	And...
3464451	3465052	He wants your email bad.
3479591	3485817	I gotta say though, we've actually kind of heard a lot about... In fact, part B has been kind of late the past two weeks and that's my fault.
3485917	3489341	And I've actually been kind of getting flack from the people who listen to us at work.
3489661	3492464	Like, why weren't we up for them to listen to Thursday or Friday at work?
3492744	3497369	So I know there's a lot of people that use us to pass the day by at work and I really, really apologize for that.
3498150	3500292	Of course, we are only three hours of show a week.
3500872	3527332	and you know hopefully maybe one day we'll be able to put out a little more other specials and things but if you're looking for other shows that are quality check out our family at allgames.com there's some great shows there will you like all of them probably not because the shows all talk about different types of games you know and there's but that's kind of what makes the network cool is that you have different gamer bases talking about all different types of things there's bound to be at least one other show on there you're like what were you laughing at Loki yeah
3528775	3529115	Nothing?
3530137	3530737	What is this?
3531718	3532759	Read an email, DarkSakura.
3532779	3535142	I have to spy on Loki and see what he's watching.
3535162	3541889	Well, I do want to thank Rob with 2Bs who sent us presents for our 6th anniversary.
3542510	3547996	And I will check them out in a bit, but I wanted to thank you very much for sending us your MyCookRewards.
3550410	3552611	Yes, and I saw that too, so big thank you.
3552691	3556354	We will definitely figure out a way to work those in to our anniversary show.
3556694	3557995	Here's the thing he's watching.
3558075	3558315	What?
3558715	3560416	Tiger Claw was telling me about this before the show.
3560456	3560776	What?
3560996	3567360	Someone has done a shot-for-shot remake of the introduction to the Naked Gun, but in Grand Theft Auto 4.
3568041	3569462	Using the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine.
3569502	3571303	They have recreated the intro to the Naked Gun.
3571983	3573384	And Loki's laughing his ass off over here.
3573404	3575045	I'm going to have to look for that when I get home.
3575085	3576126	Tiger Claw will give you the link.
3576346	3576526	Just...
3578120	3580682	TigerClaw, send it to the mailbag so Jamie can look it up at home.
3582003	3583063	Thanks, XXOO.
3584084	3584544	More emails?
3585065	3585365	One more.
3585605	3585905	One more.
3585985	3586326	Unamas.
3586866	3587126	One more.
3588347	3589808	This comes from Geekboy.
3591289	3592410	Hey guys, I'm about to get a 360.
3592750	3598274	If I like first person shooters, what would I get except for the obvious ones?
3598814	3601296	Any other game recommendations will be thanked.
3601656	3602036	Thanks.
3602416	3603297	Keep up the great work.
3604258	3605338	I'm sorry, what system was it?
3605358	3605338	360. 360.
3606821	3608462	360 first-person shooters.
3609143	3609903	Call of Duty 4.
3612304	3612605	I don't know.
3612865	3618488	You kind of, when you say besides the obvious ones, well, the obvious ones are the good ones usually.
3618548	3619809	That's why they're kind of obvious.
3619849	3621590	So you kind of, I don't know.
3621810	3628934	I guess, you know, you're probably asking the wrong people because I don't think a lot of us are super into first-person shooters as much as we are, say, RPGs and adventure games.
3629114	3630155	I'm really not myself.
3630515	3637417	But I will say this, Orange Box, if you overlook that, some great first... Not just Portal, but Half-Life, Half-Life 2.
3637557	3639338	Half-Life 2 was freaking great.
3639378	3641078	That's like the best first-person shooter deal.
3641138	3643919	It's a better deal than Halo, because Halo is just one game.
3644039	3644939	Orange Box is like five.
3646240	3653182	Otherwise, I know I might take a little flack for saying this, and it's not really for hardcore first-person players, but I liked Prey.
3653242	3654582	There was a lot about Prey I liked.
3654822	3655723	Saw says Iron Man.
3655943	3656323	And I think...
3657163	3658324	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3677842	3679563	And it's like $10 probably at this point.
3679823	3681943	So there's my recommendation, I guess.
3681983	3690186	Well, I was checking this, and I think that it's because the Kenya email was a Gmail account.
3691187	3693107	It's reading an America IP.
3695868	3701030	But Google is international, and they do run out of the United States.
3701350	3701730	We'll see.
3702150	3703511	Send us a picture of this America cafe.
3703531	3706232	We're waiting for the picture of the cafe.
3706292	3707212	Or either... Look...
3708539	3712242	either send us a picture of the cafe or fess up that you were fake and just tell us why.
3712342	3713443	I mean, we don't care at this point.
3713463	3715705	We read the email, but I've got to know why that.
3715785	3717226	Why did she have to read that?
3717886	3718727	I mean, was it a dare?
3718867	3719347	I don't get it.
3719748	3719988	All right.
3721297	3721697	Anything else?
3721837	3726039	I'm checking the inbox to see if we got a... No, but we did get one.
3726059	3726919	This is Pokemans.
3727539	3728340	I'm going to read it next week.
3728560	3728800	All right.
3729520	3731081	So tune in next week for more Mailbag.
3731361	3738123	Hey, speaking of interactivity, the Skypline will be open very soon, but we got two more stories for you before we get to the Skypline, which we're kind of keeping short tonight.
3738143	3745546	We're trying to keep our show a little short tonight because we've got other things we've got to get to for tomorrow, but we will get at least a couple calls in after these two quick stories.
3745566	3745806	Loki.
3746206	3750368	Well, Home is coming out this year, so says Sony.
3751829	3759176	Um, but, they say now it's going to be released in the fall as an open working beta.
3760017	3764021	I guess that's a fancy way of saying, well, it's not really done yet, but we're releasing it anyways.
3765603	3769587	Really, when they think about it, I guess it's kind of like every single game that comes out nowadays anyways.
3769761	3775023	Well, also, pretty much anything Google does and Google launches is a beta.
3775883	3783986	So it's kind of like that thing where it's like, well, we're launching this and it's going to have all these awesome features, but don't blame us if it sucks because it's a beta.
3784486	3785347	No, I don't think so.
3786127	3789208	That may work for Google because they're always improving their services and stuff.
3790270	3790790	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3817597	3817957	Whatever.
3818017	3819238	At least it's coming out, I guess.
3819838	3821879	And either way, people have been playing it in beta.
3823179	3823519	I don't know.
3823859	3827801	To be honest, I don't think Home is going to be as big as they're hoping it's going to be.
3828501	3830762	I think people are going to find it as being a big waste of time.
3832103	3832523	But we'll see.
3835924	3836804	Sorry for the dead air there.
3836864	3839405	I was typing some things in chat real quick.
3839545	3840626	He was typing of the dead.
3841026	3842447	Yes, I was typing of the dead, and I won.
3842567	3842727	I got 100%.
3845528	3874498	Resident Evil 5 you know they've kind of been accused of being racist and so on I don't know if you heard about that but you know because in the trailers and stuff you know whatever but here's the thing is that the producer of Resident Evil 5 Jun Takushi has actually denied saying there's nothing racist about this game y'all are just misunderstanding the original trailer which I would believe because people are too freaking sensitive nowadays come on anybody can be a zombie regardless of race can we all agree on that I agree
3875949	3876329	Oh, go ahead.
3876349	3876429	What?
3895345	3915344	Yeah, in the Japanese Biohazard, when you go in the room, and I hope this is not Chris' bloodline and everything, and so you go into the other room, there's a zombie chewing off the neck of one of the team members who had been in there before, and his head pops off and rolls off, and it looks like Michael Jordan.
3915784	3918207	Or it's supposed to, in however PS1 graphics did.
3919447	3923889	They cut that out on the US version in that cinematic.
3924270	3929352	They also cut out the part with Chris lighting up a cigarette with this huge lighter.
3931473	3937195	I've got a Japanese version of Biohazard, so it's no big freaking deal.
3938556	3940457	But I thought that that was the same thing.
3940477	3941297	Hmm.
3942168	3951333	Well, I mean, speaking of characters and stuff, there is a new character in the game who is a black female who's going to have a role in Resident Evil 5 as somebody you can actually include.
3951773	3961659	And see, here's the thing, is that the question was asked, did you put this character in because of the fact that the trailer showed that you're blowing up people in Africa and that they're all the zombies and stuff?
3962419	3965140	And Takushi said, no, she's pretty much been there in the beginning.
3966081	3968682	In terms of the reaction, we're in the business of entertainment.
3968963	3971424	We didn't set out to make a racist game or a political statement.
3971844	3983488	We did feel there was a misunderstanding about the initial trailer, which probably was just some people being a little bit oversensitive, I think, because, you know, anybody can be a zombie, right?
3987009	3989330	But you don't see a lot of fat zombies in Resident Evil, do you?
3989430	3989950	Yes, you do.
3990130	3990390	Do you?
3990830	3997372	There was a cop in the first one who died, and then he came back as a fat zombie.
3998933	3999233	Okay.
3999513	3999713	Yeah.
4000872	4002837	I know my video game trivia.
4002857	4004261	Thank you.
4005282	4009445	All right, we're going to go to the Skype line here, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4009505	4015470	But first, I'm told that there is a very important voicemail we're supposed to play that was left in the box last night.
4016051	4018072	And I'm just thinking about what goes on Saturday.
4018092	4018913	It was overnight.
4019033	4022796	No, I'm thinking about things that go on on All Games Radio on Saturday night.
4022816	4023276	Oh, sweet.
4023436	4025098	And I'm a little bit worried about this one.
4025178	4031122	So I'm going to go play this voicemail and kind of hope that it's not too strange.
4031303	4031643	We'll see.
4035307	4035867	It's downloading.
4062386	4065889	I remember that.
4066089	4068371	That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.
4068391	4069692	I remember that commercial.
4069712	4072194	And that's 30 seconds of all your lives you'll never get back either.
4072454	4075577	Well, every second of your life is a second you'll never get back.
4076197	4078539	Tiger Claw says we just got bucket rolled.
4080161	4081181	What the crap?
4081542	4082723	Is that the new thing now?
4084437	4085718	Is that replaced Rickrolling?
4086098	4089961	By the way, by the way, I went to a sushi restaurant last night.
4090001	4092443	My friend Jim, his birthday, he's turning 30.
4092503	4093664	Happy birthday, Jim, if you're listening.
4094104	4094785	Here's the thing.
4095105	4098608	They actually have a sushi roll called the Rick-O-Roll.
4100469	4101049	Can you believe that?
4101089	4103111	They actually now have sushi called the Rick-Roll.
4103171	4105553	Did you get a... Screw all of you!
4106033	4107915	Don't they have Ricky-O as like a...
4108869	4126354	Asian, Kung Fu I don't know, but of course the whole table looked at it and went, ha ha ha, Rickroll, ha ha ha And I was just like, Rickrolls need to die in a boat fire Underwater volcano, that whole thing Alright, we got calls We got calls, let's go to the Skype line Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4127014	4136336	RavensDolphin, long time no hear Well, hello RavensDolphin Damn, it's been a long time since you've managed to be the first caller here on OLR What is on your mind, my friend?
4136716	4138077	First off, what the hell have you been up to?
4139103	4139904	DeadPixelLive
4163593	4165255	All right, well, there you have it here on All Games Radio.
4165275	4165855	What time do you start?
4165875	4167357	You just start whenever All Games finishes?
4167977	4175665	Yeah, whenever they reach out and they said, all right, they pull the plug, and then we start with our... The other host is Derek H. Very cool.
4176085	4179408	I don't think Derek H. likes our show, though, which makes me a sad panda.
4180009	4180429	Don't worry.
4181350	4181890	One half does.
4181930	4182811	Why doesn't he love me?
4183512	4185214	I want to know why doesn't Derek H. love me.
4185914	4186335	I don't know.
4186635	4187256	It ain't my fault.
4189048	4189508	I love him.
4189548	4190649	You pass along that message.
4190809	4192090	We here at OLR, we love Derek.
4192990	4194411	We hope that that love is reciprocated.
4194491	4196192	Alright, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
4196632	4197152	Two things.
4199133	4201314	It's about Microsoft and the Blu-ray thing.
4201354	4202135	I think it's dumb.
4203255	4203856	Why is it dumb?
4203896	4206997	Do you think it's BS or do you think the idea itself is dumb?
4207577	4209158	I just think it's dumb in general.
4209238	4211559	It's like, hey, MGS4 is coming.
4211599	4214281	It's like, we must combat it with a Blu-ray player.
4214461	4217903	It just feels like it shouldn't be necessary until the Xbox 720.
4221684	4227066	Yes and no, because right now, why are a lot of people buying PlayStation 3s right now?
4227106	4234510	I kind of said this earlier in the show, because it plays Grand Theft Auto 4 and Blu-rays, whereas Xbox 360 only plays Grand Theft Auto 4 right now.
4234550	4235750	It's not really a movie system.
4235790	4239072	Yay DVDs, but everybody has a freaking DVD player at this point, right?
4239312	4240893	Not a lot of people are looking for that in their systems.
4241853	4249396	And people, I think, the normal average Joe, I'm not a gamer, but I enjoy the occasional violent video game, right?
4249877	4255219	They don't know about all this, like, download exclusive Xbox 360 stuff.
4255539	4256659	They don't know about all that stuff.
4257340	4258800	They just think it's the same damn game.
4259961	4260321	I agree.
4260701	4262862	So, you know, just something to consider.
4263702	4269365	I just, I agree with Loki when he said, if they bundle, like, a new one in, I feel like that's suicide.
4269385	4269465	Yeah.
4271343	4272824	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4295615	4297096	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4318697	4324793	because Rainbow Bright, it's all dark and gloomy, and you have to fill the world with color, and this is what the game does.
4324833	4326116	You fill the world with color.
4326878	4327139	Nice.
4331770	4333550	Who was the evil guy in Rainbow Bride?
4333570	4334391	I can't remember his name.
4335271	4336892	Murky and Lurky.
4337172	4340233	I'm sorry, I was thinking of the peculiar purple pie man.
4340393	4342434	Yeah, I keep thinking of Strawberry Shortcake too.
4343554	4345335	They're so easy to get confused, I guess.
4345935	4346496	Alright, forget it.
4346816	4348957	Alright, Evans Dolphin, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4350277	4352418	Dead Pigs Alive, right after All Games Interactive.
4352438	4353558	Plug, plug, plug.
4353618	4354139	There you go.
4354279	4354919	Have a good one, buddy.
4356820	4357381	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4381069	4381750	Spazinator.
4381950	4383371	Spazinator.
4383431	4385493	Need to go buy on the PlayStation Network.
4385793	4386214	Awesome.
4386234	4387455	What's on your mind, Spazinator?
4388616	4390177	Yeah, a couple things.
4391158	4395482	Much of which you kind of sort of touched on on tonight's show, especially in part one.
4397143	4407673	Now, I do have one concern about Soul Calibur 4, which is going to be coming out next month with all the characters from Star Wars and whatnot.
4408521	4419265	If you think about it, you know how in all the Star Wars movies supposedly the lightsabers pretty much cut through 99% of everything out there?
4420325	4423686	Like limbs and walls and stuff like that?
4424927	4436111	In theory, if they want the Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur IV to be totally active and whatnot, wouldn't they be way overpowered and whatnot?
4436171	4436871	You know, like
4437423	4443047	You know, cut off people's legs and, you know, totally break down the characters' weapons and whatnot?
4444087	4448350	Well, I think, you know, they're probably just going to balance it.
4448410	4450531	Just like, you know, when things have crossed over before.
4450591	4453533	Like, you know, when Spawn and Link and all those characters showed up before.
4453874	4455515	You know, they just kind of made it work.
4455575	4456455	They just balanced it.
4456495	4457756	And that's just what they're going to do here.
4458076	4460638	I mean, and all these kind of crossover games.
4460698	4463380	I mean, like Capcom versus X-Men.
4463660	4466602	I mean, certainly superheroes would overpower these, you know...
4467182	4467422	Oh, yeah.
4490683	4495846	Yeah, I have no doubt that the game's going to be good.
4495906	4504510	I'm kind of both a Soul Calibur fan and a Star Wars nut, so that thought did kind of cross my mind like a week ago.
4505070	4507051	So you're okay with this?
4507071	4511273	Because a lot of people in our chat room earlier were kind of like, oh, why can't they just make Star Wars its own game?
4511313	4513134	Why do they have to have all these Star Wars characters?
4513354	4516175	You're okay with both kind of living together in the same game?
4517016	4517856	Oh, yeah.
4518116	4519277	It was just that little...
4528497	4530758	TigerClaw made a very similar observation to what you're saying.
4530798	4535100	He says in chat here, That's one of the things I noticed when I saw the gameplay footage of Vader and SoulCalibur IV.
4535440	4537741	He can literally impale an opponent and throw them.
4538041	4541023	Normally, a lightsaber would cut through someone effortlessly.
4542043	4542323	Oh, yeah.
4543424	4544124	So there you have it.
4544884	4546165	It's a low wattage.
4547034	4550135	Now, Spazinator, do you think they ought to make a new Star Wars fighting game?
4550295	4555997	Like, if this does really well, do you think Namco needs to be paid a lot of money to make a new Star Wars fighting game?
4556017	4557378	Like, we'll just pretend the other one never happened?
4558418	4570882	Well, actually, now that you mention it, I did buy the first one for the PlayStation 1 when it came out, and I wouldn't necessarily say it was horrible, like E.T.
4570942	4571383	for its 2600 badge.
4572918	4577982	but it wasn't exactly game of the year like Final Fantasy 7 great either, you know.
4578082	4579984	It was kind of like middle of the road for me.
4581365	4585688	But I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to a new Star Wars fighting game, though.
4586989	4590632	Hopefully this is Namco putting their feet in the water a little bit and seeing if it's possible.
4590712	4591092	I don't know.
4591513	4591873	I don't know.
4592413	4592774	We can hope.
4593935	4594195	Go ahead.
4594355	4595956	Oh, go ahead.
4595976	4596176	Sorry.
4596196	4599359	I was just going to say, is there anything else you want to talk about before we go, Spazinator?
4599379	4599559	Yeah.
4601090	4616862	I know that you've kind of gone away from Final Fantasy XI and more into WoW, but that was notwithstanding, have you heard anything about a fan festival like what they had in Anaheim last year?
4618203	4623045	I have not, but from what I understand, Squeenix usually announces those things pretty last minute.
4623105	4626366	I mean, not like, you know, the day before, but they'll only give like two months notice.
4627066	4631228	Whereas with Blizzard, you know, they've already announced, hey, BlizzCon's gonna happen, mark the date.
4631568	4641031	And maybe it's because BlizzCon gets a hell of a lot more people, not just because they have WoW, but they also have StarCraft and, you know, some of those other, you know, powerhouse games and Diablo 3 rumors are enough to get people to go too.
4642765	4643906	I haven't heard anything, though.
4644006	4651251	Even though I left Final Fantasy XI, I do keep tabs on the news just to see if there's anything really cool I'm missing out on.
4651371	4651771	I don't know.
4652172	4655994	I spent so much time with that freaking game, you can't help but just kind of be curious about it.
4656314	4658215	It's almost like a bad relationship.
4658856	4661197	You can't help but wonder, whatever happened to your ex?
4662718	4663459	You know what I mean?
4663499	4667982	Honestly, I've been playing the PlayStation 2 version of the game for...
4669144	4671926	Two, two and a half years now, and I'm practically addicted to it.
4672166	4674147	Even now that I got to play season three.
4675088	4689697	And the reason I ask my question is, in theory, if they hold the Fan Festival this year, this will be the first year I can actually afford to literally go cross-country and go to the Fan Festival.
4690478	4695861	And from what I've been told, some of my friends are going to be over there, and I've been just dying to go to the festival.
4697857	4701098	If they hold it in California, I might actually try to go.
4701118	4702158	Because it might be a lot of fun.
4702198	4703638	Especially if it's within driving distance.
4703698	4705179	I think they had one of them in Santa Cruz.
4705199	4705999	And that's not that far.
4706539	4707419	So I could have gone to that.
4708020	4709820	But I just didn't know about it until after it already happened.
4709840	4712241	Because it was when I was not really playing.
4714061	4717482	As a video game journalist, to report on the event.
4719762	4721343	Well, thanks for taking my call.
4722003	4722803	You are welcome.
4722823	4725484	We like hearing from people that we don't get to hear from very often.
4725524	4726324	So take care, alright?
4727300	4731943	Oh, I just thought of something, and then I'll let you go.
4731963	4739026	You know, earlier in the show you were asking about that new Commando 3 game.
4739387	4745290	Yeah, that's going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 next week, and it's already out for the PS3.
4746090	4753134	I already got the game, and I don't know if there's going to be a difference between the two versions, but at least the PlayStation 3 game is pretty good.
4753854	4755055	Well, that's a good sign.
4755095	4755275	Yeah.
4755962	4763127	So if you guys got the 360 or the PS3, I would seriously suggest investing the $10 for the game.
4763987	4769751	I will definitely check out the demo and see if it's worth it because I am tempted by the beta of the new Street Fighter because I do heart Street Fighter.
4770592	4771472	But yeah, I guess that's true.
4771513	4775715	It's already out on PS3, so it's good to know that the game's not bad so that you're not wasting your $10.
4776296	4777597	But we'll see when that demo comes out.
4779198	4779438	All right.
4779658	4780458	Well, have a good one.
4780719	4780939	All right.
4780959	4781599	Thanks, Spazinator.
4781619	4782180	Thanks for your call.
4782240	4782700	Take care, buddy.
4784021	4784221	All right.
4784531	4788513	We'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we're going to call it a night.
4788573	4789554	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4789574	4789894	Who's this?
4791155	4791895	Oh, wow.
4792375	4793316	It's Legend of Zaku.
4793776	4795177	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
4795357	4798078	No show is complete without a call from Legend of Zaku.
4798098	4798459	Damn right.
4798479	4799919	It's been far too long.
4799959	4800960	What is on your mind, Zaku?
4801880	4810585	Nothing much, just basically just enjoying all my usual games on my 360, like Grand Theft Auto 4 and whatnot.
4811686	4814648	That's right, you upgraded to a 360 not too long ago, huh?
4815388	4817630	Yeah, it's been like about six months.
4818050	4819190	What kind of games have you been playing?
4819951	4821032	Grand Theft Auto, obviously.
4821952	4828256	Kicked the shit out of Call of Duty 4 on Veterans, so that boosted up my achievement scores.
4829502	4837083	But besides that, I'm just, you know, just trying to scrap as many games as possible since, you know, money's kind of tight right now.
4838624	4842684	But, you know, it hasn't been so bad.
4843544	4847125	You know the new unlock code for DDR, you know, for Supernova 2 came out, right?
4847625	4849926	I did hear something about that, that there's some new unlocks.
4850486	4852106	Tell us about it since we didn't report on it tonight.
4852146	4857047	I don't know, it's like I spent the better part of Friday and Dave and Buster's trying to do that shit and it...
4858628	4859529	We weren't able to.
4860429	4862050	Huh, it has to be hooked up to the EMUs.
4864431	4864871	Are you sure?
4864911	4865391	Oh, snap.
4865911	4867692	So, can't.
4867952	4868333	Are you sure?
4868393	4875936	Because that one actually was an unlock code in which you actually have to input certain, you have to hit certain arrows after you enter your credit.
4876356	4879738	I still think it had to be hooked up to the EMUs, if I remember correctly.
4879918	4880298	Why is that?
4880976	4881496	I don't know why.
4881876	4884717	I don't know why they have this kind of... Does it download the songs or something?
4885577	4891019	I think it's because there was some other competition thing that went along with some Zouken Battle 3 or 2 or something like that.
4891039	4891399	I don't know.
4892419	4898781	From what I heard, other machines besides the one in Illinois, which is the only EMUs in the country, managed to get the code.
4899281	4900141	Managed to get it working.
4900661	4901881	Well, then your machine doesn't like you.
4903082	4905642	Well, it just has shitty pads, but that's besides the point.
4907083	4908403	Yeah, just looking through...
4909807	4911259	I don't know, it's just been a rough...
4912603	4916647	I still try to load DDR Freak and look at the forums once in a while, just keep tabs on what's going on.
4916667	4921030	Are there any big tournaments or big things we ought to be looking forward to?
4921050	4921191	Maybe...
4941803	4942724	What about Digital Life?
4942825	4944787	Usually you're calling in Digital Life, Digital Life.
4944827	4945869	Is that happening this year?
4947291	4948513	It hasn't been confirmed yet.
4948553	4949134	That's the thing.
4950195	4952338	Until I get confirmation, I'll let you know.
4952358	4955263	But right now, I'm not going to jump the gun quickly when...
4955987	4958310	We'll tell you when we're ready, dang it.
4958330	4960373	That's what they're saying.
4960393	4962295	We'll tell you when we're ready.
4972870	4973110	Right.
4973410	4973730	All right.
4973890	4975471	So that's it.
4975491	4978051	I'll let you know once I hear word of it happening.
4978551	4978892	All right.
4979592	4980232	Sounds good, buddy.
4980272	4982032	Hey, we've got to wrap up and close the show.
4982072	4983773	You got any parting words for our listener tonight?
4984633	4985453	Listeners?
4986934	4988074	Just hack your PSP.
4988594	4989774	Hack your PSP.
4990234	4990895	All right, buddy.
4990935	4991615	Have a good one.
4995129	4996490	That's some great final words.
4996550	4997511	Hack your PSP.
4997611	4998192	It's awesome.
4999012	5000754	This naked gun thing is great.
5000914	5002215	Did you check that out?
5002535	5002956	It's awesome.
5002976	5004557	Alright, we're going to do some last minute stories.
5004577	5005778	We're actually going to start with Jamie tonight.
5007917	5034323	I just think that he who shall not be named more news about him is that he's been well it's not that it's official yet but he's been recommended for a 10 year disbarment for his 27 misconduct charges also it should be noted that two of his Supreme Court cases were actually dismissed with prejudice meaning he can't file it again so I'm
5036303	5039204	Hope the judge says yes and goes for the 10 years.
5040424	5042145	Again, this is about he who shall not be named.
5042805	5053869	Well, he was very... Oh, yeah, they wouldn't let him read his... Yeah, his long argument or whatever, which pretty much called everyone a dumbass and stuff like that.
5054529	5055169	Real class.
5055950	5058350	Yeah, the judge didn't allow him to read.
5058410	5060111	And he had prepared it in advance, of course.
5060131	5061211	I was like, whatever, dude.
5062172	5062752	So, yeah.
5065365	5066606	I think it's going to go through.
5066887	5068789	Prepared my speech on why I'm awesome.
5069610	5071373	You want me to read it?
5072234	5072574	Anyway.
5073555	5073896	Alright.
5074947	5076149	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5096587	5098207	XBOX Live Multiplayer and Feature 2-Person Online Co-op
5123239	5126750	and that's all in GamePro's July issue which should be out soon.
5128017	5134022	Also, we were talking about movies earlier with Leonardo DiCaprio being in the Atari movie.
5134123	5143230	Well, now there's another movie being made, Kane and Lynch, with Bruce Willis going to be starring in it as Kane Marcus.
5143791	5145232	Or Adam Kane Marcus, I guess.
5146393	5151357	Which is weird because Billy Bob Thornton apparently is in talks for the role of Lynch.
5151918	5152418	So it's like...
5153880	5155141	That's going to be a classy movie.
5156422	5156722	I don't know.
5156742	5157042	We'll see.
5158123	5166468	Sony has apparently stopped production of a couple games that they were showing off, hell, I think before the PS3 even came out, including Eight Days and The Getaway.
5166588	5172332	Eight Days, I believe, was that one that they showed the demo for, including all the bullets ripping up a car and that kind of stuff.
5173928	5175509	Oh well, not coming out I guess.
5177271	5187019	The Bioshock movie, which we talked about I believe last week, has been confirmed of course as part of the conference call following Take-Two's second quarter earnings.
5187940	5188821	They addressed the...
5190282	5190562	I don't know.
5214645	5220027	And then finally, I forgot to talk about this earlier, Rock Band, the download content for this coming week.
5220907	5225228	They've got the MTV 2-pack, which is going to feature... Crap.
5225868	5226069	Yeah.
5226429	5228449	Moving to Seattle by The Material.
5228489	5229290	I've never heard of them.
5230110	5231610	A Clean Shot by The Myriad.
5232511	5235071	Bullets and Guns by Them Terribles.
5235872	5236572	Those are each...
5237560	5241203	Available for 80 Microsoft Points or 240 points for the entire pack.
5241803	5249609	And finally, an individual song, Girls Who Play Guitars by Maximo Park for also 80 points.
5251110	5251390	Alright.
5252062	5253083	Is that it for Last Minute Stories?
5253263	5253943	That is it.
5254284	5254764	All right.
5254864	5256045	Well, then that's going to wind down.
5256125	5257746	Oh, and to answer a question you had earlier.
5257766	5258287	Hey, wait a minute.
5258307	5259327	You said, okay.
5259347	5260348	Sorry, this is answering a question.
5260368	5260909	This is not a story.
5260989	5261269	All right.
5261869	5264931	One block equals 128 kilobytes.
5265752	5271296	So if you do the math there, I believe it's 500 blocks.
5271416	5271716	I don't know.
5271897	5272137	All right.
5272961	5275283	Anyhow, we're going to wrap up the show now.
5275363	5278345	It's time to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Laundry.
5278365	5280927	But not before we get everybody's final thought.
5281687	5283328	I will start tonight with my final thought.
5283388	5291374	And my final thought is that these Haribo Happy Cola gummy candies that are like the little bottles of cola are like the yummiest things in the world.
5291414	5292174	I love these things.
5292835	5294176	And they're nonfat, which is awesome.
5294316	5295477	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5297378	5298659	I want food.
5299079	5299560	Real food.
5300040	5301501	The kind you can eat and digest.
5301521	5301601	Yeah.
5302236	5303117	Loki, your final thought.
5304597	5313382	My final thought is, goddammit, I gotta get 100% on Grand Theft Auto 4.
5314543	5321527	I have to basically unlock the special ability of Paki.
5321607	5329091	Basically, when you get your friendship up a certain percentage, he'll allow you to call him to give you cars with bombs in them.
5330014	5335477	and that will kick me over to 100% and I get the achievement and I'm done with the story.
5335497	5336618	Cars with bombs.
5336818	5337258	Awesome.
5339919	5340240	Alright.
5340740	5342941	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
