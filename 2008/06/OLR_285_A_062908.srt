[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,597
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just trying to butter me up for something.

9
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have a dollar?

10
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,118
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I don't have a dollar.

11
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:11,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a dollar.

12
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:12,679
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

13
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:13,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

14
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,640
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have some of my Diet Cherry Pepsi.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a festive mood tonight.

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,421
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been busy.

18
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,121
[SPEAKER_00]: A busy boy.

19
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been a very busy boy.

20
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I was out of town most of the weekend.

21
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:24,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I was marching in a big parade this morning, which was fun.

22
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:25,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what would make you cry.

23
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:26,343
[SPEAKER_03]: What would make me cry?

24
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:28,204
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find out during what I've played this week.

25
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:30,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well we'll get to that in just a sec.

26
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wouldn't be able to get to How Was Your Gaming Week if I wasn't able to introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

27
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:37,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

28
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,131
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

29
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:38,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine.

30
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:43,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to figure out something that I was talking about before we started the show.

31
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't remember the damn name of the game.

32
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:46,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's bugging me.

33
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,419
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it that we were talking about before the show?

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about a lot of things before the show.

35
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I was saying that song should be in a side-scrolling game.

36
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, like the new Konami one.

37
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:55,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the name of the game though, but...

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

39
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:16,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We played a track by Akira Yamaoka.

40
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:19,446
[SPEAKER_03]: You know him from the dude that does all the music of Silent Hill.

41
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:24,110
[SPEAKER_03]: He also contributes to one of our favorite gaming series ever, Beatmania 2DX.

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And that particular track was from Beatmania Gold.

43
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Playback Hate You was the name of that song.

44
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki was saying it's a pretty awesome song that should be in another game he was thinking of.

45
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:34,817
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

46
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:38,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well speaking of games, we've got a lot of gaming news tonight.

47
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,900
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an interview tonight.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Tommy Tallarico is here.

49
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:47,465
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be joining us during Part B. But first, we've got to start the show as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week.

50
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:48,926
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what did you play this week?

51
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:57,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I downloaded the, when we were at Weeby Toys, aka Toys R Us, I downloaded the Iron Man DS game demo.

52
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of sucked, but the controls were really cool.

53
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the controls are kind of complicated, but they were pretty cool.

54
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what are the controls, kind of?

55
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:08,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you describe it?

56
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:15,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got your... It actually moves up, left, down, right, you know, just like any regular game doesn't do, like, flight commands.

57
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:19,918
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you shoot, you touch the touch screen on your little radar pad, and it controls the direction you shoot.

58
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:25,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually move your thumb all around and have them circle around and shoot like that and still move in different directions.

59
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part was cool.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,801
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pick up bombs and lock on, but it was fairly difficult from the get-go.

61
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly...

62
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:37,164
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of game needs a bigger screen, so that didn't quite fly.

63
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's the game I was talking about.

64
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:45,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Otomedius, which is a shooter game with cleavage-heavy characters.

65
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a Gradius spinoff, and it's in arcades in Japan right now.

66
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be coming to the Xbox 360 on September 25th in Japan.

67
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you go.

68
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in high def on the 360.

69
00:03:57,308 --> 00:04:04,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, comment from our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com SSJ100Matt, going back to Iron Man, says, And I thought Jamie was anti-Tony Stark.

70
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:09,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the... Well, okay, I like the character.

71
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate what a big dick he's been in the whole, you know, regular Marvel continuity.

72
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,365
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the character, and the movie was pretty cool.

73
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the game, not nearly as cool as the movie.

74
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine Babies

75
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Miklatov's peering through the door.

76
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:41,674
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going back to Kansas, so he's waving goodbye forever.

77
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:43,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

78
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Live radio.

79
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:44,837
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sucked.

80
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to wave the rattle at the stupid baby.

81
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,202
[SPEAKER_03]: How does Imagine Babies work?

82
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:55,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I picture it like Nintendogs, the way you describe it, like instead of shaking the head.

83
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,448
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a stupid game.

84
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:58,729
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for little children.

85
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,252
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cute, but I'm like, I don't want any real children.

86
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:02,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I want fake children?

87
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:03,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

88
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: because fake children you can do stuff to and CPS won't get called.

89
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,877
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't let you do crap to them in the game.

90
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,278
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pick them up and throw them out the window.

91
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:31,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

92
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,582
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't dangle them out the window all Michael Jackson style in real life because that's wrong.

93
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,383
[SPEAKER_03]: But in a video game, you can do anything.

94
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,225
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate, it sucked ass.

95
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:48,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved to a new Ragnarok server because our old one has sort of gone to shit.

96
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that sucks.

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing on Void RO now.

98
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,363
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty cool.

99
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,804
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot cooler, actually.

100
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:58,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool people run it.

101
00:05:59,667 --> 00:05:59,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

102
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.

103
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:03,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

104
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

105
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure you're done?

106
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:10,899
[SPEAKER_00]: I also laughed my ass off watching Dan play GTA 4.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,621
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty funny.

108
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:13,742
[SPEAKER_03]: What was so funny that happened?

109
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:17,519
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

110
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:48,602
[SPEAKER_03]: FearTheClaw in chat.orangelandtrader.com says, if Imagine Babies is like Nintendogs, does that mean you can pet them to make them happy?

111
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:49,623
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be creepy.

112
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:51,689
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wave a rattle at them.

113
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,513
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing it has you do is it shows you the baby.

114
00:06:56,793 --> 00:07:00,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this dark background with a patch of light.

115
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:03,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to wave the rattle in that patch of light as it moves around.

116
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:08,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And the closer you stay in the middle of it, the happier the baby gets or some shit.

117
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:09,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go towards the light!

118
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Run away, Carol Ann!

119
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't get paid if you die!

120
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

121
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:17,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It was alright.

122
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:21,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to play as much because I've been working on web pages.

123
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto 4, as usual.

124
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Still fascinated by the stupid swing set.

125
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,801
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do during lunch now.

126
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:40,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That and fire rockets at each other with friendly fire turned off so that we just fly into the air and just take damage from the impact.

127
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:43,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, we're easily amused.

128
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:54,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also played over here actually the other day because I got Rob a copy for his birthday and it's odd that I'm playing his copy of the game before I played mine which I bought weeks ago.

129
00:07:55,127 --> 00:08:00,129
[SPEAKER_02]: But Blastworks and we actually played that a bit and that was funny because people were amused by it.

130
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,069
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, look at your ship, it's like taking up the whole screen.

131
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

132
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,490
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

133
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:35,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

134
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:39,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I'm trying to think if I played anything else.

135
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I did.

136
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:45,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I checked out that... I don't remember what it's called now.

137
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like some cooking guide.

138
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't decide what to eat or whatever.

139
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:49,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

140
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,500
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a neat concept.

141
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:55,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really a game, but just a recipe book.

142
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:58,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It teaches you how to do different techniques and stuff.

143
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of video and stuff in there.

144
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, you can make your own shopping lists and stuff like that.

145
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:04,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

146
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:05,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

147
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:06,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

148
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:09,578
[SPEAKER_02]: The recipes were kind of limited.

149
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:10,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you could add your own.

150
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

151
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:16,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neat idea.

152
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:18,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that needs to be done over here, I think.

153
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there was that Gourmet Chef game that came out over here.

154
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is, though.

155
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:26,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of cooking games getting popular over here.

156
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:40,800
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

157
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:20,175
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of sucks if it's similar to that it should be just like kind of American Idol what American Idol is a karaoke revolution you know where they berate you for sucking that's what should be like Cookie Mama but instead of Mama Will Fix It it's you're fucking lame you suck take this game back to the store because you suck I'm coming to your house and killing you and your family get out of my face fuck off

158
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the show is.

159
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:48,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very hard shooter at first, but once you get the hang of it, there's a certain delicate balance to it.

160
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably heard this game by now is based on Tamiki Fighters.

161
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine Katamari Damacy meets a shooter game.

162
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:59,491
[SPEAKER_03]: As you destroy ships, you can run over them and attach them to your ship.

163
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,092
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can imagine, the ship gets quite huge.

164
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:04,934
[SPEAKER_03]: The trick is having to balance using the collapse button.

165
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:05,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

166
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:41,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I was feeling a little bit retro this week, and it'll probably be explained why when we get into the news a little later, but I decided to go pick up an old GameCube game, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.

167
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:48,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to pick up because I was suddenly getting a hankering for playing Mega Man again, and I'm sure as we get into tonight's news, you'll understand why if you haven't already heard.

168
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:56,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know there's a lot of people that talk smack about the GameCube version of Mega Man Anniversary Collection because the buttons are switched, and you can't

169
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't turn them around very easily.

170
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:01,692
[SPEAKER_03]: But look, let me put it this way.

171
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It cost me six bucks.

172
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to complain with that.

173
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:06,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm having fun.

174
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the old Mega Man games all over again.

175
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:15,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing a little bit of Mega Man 8 because the anime scenes in Mega Man 8 are so crappy and the voiceovers and stuff.

176
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:16,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I laugh every time.

177
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:17,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

178
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:21,010
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to go back and play the old school Mega Mans too because, you know...

179
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,130
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all there.

180
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Mega Man 1 through 8, and then the fighting games you unlock, too.

181
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the fighting games are kind of lame.

182
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my work cut out for me.

183
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:31,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I've played them before on MAME, and I think they're on GameTap?

184
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're on there.

185
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:33,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

186
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:37,293
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've definitely played them before, and they're okay.

187
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:40,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're on the... I played them in the arcade, because they're on the Ultracade.

188
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they were never released here, they were on Ultracade.

189
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:46,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, years ago, I played it on there.

190
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

191
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:49,493
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

192
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:31,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgames.com is currently down from what I understand there was a virus something that hit the server computer I don't know the details because I'm not much of a tech person obviously if you're listening live tonight then you figured out that you can go to allgamesradio.com to listen to us or you probably have the URL of the feed saved in iTunes or what have you so it's made it very easy to listen to the show I'm told allgames.com will be back very soon probably by the time most people are hearing this podcast so no worries there

193
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:33,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

194
00:13:53,491 --> 00:14:05,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really horrible at updating Facebook because every time I log into Facebook, I have like 150 different crappy applications that are trying to say, you know, hey, so-and-so thinks you would be compatible and should go on a date.

195
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, I already am dating somebody.

196
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Or so-and-so wants you to play Scrabble with them.

197
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:12,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Or so-and-so wants you to take this quiz.

198
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm so freaking sick of all that shit.

199
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ever go to Facebook.

200
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:16,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's there.

201
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:17,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a Facebook community.

202
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:18,507
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

203
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:19,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

204
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:21,168
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

205
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:22,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things coming soon.

206
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:26,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't talk about them, but we're working on stuff soon.

207
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:27,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

208
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:28,513
[SPEAKER_03]: How descriptive, huh?

209
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:28,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Things.

210
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to build excitement.

211
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:31,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Things.

212
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are happening at some point.

213
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

214
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:38,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Penny Arcade Expo.

215
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:39,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going.

216
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm going.

217
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,840
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura might be going.

218
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Might.

219
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Big might.

220
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, however, will not be going.

221
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:46,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

222
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the wife.

223
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:48,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

224
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:48,724
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

225
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:51,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I could swing that.

226
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:51,665
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

227
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:52,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

228
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll have some representation.

229
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I know at least I will be there come hell or high water.

230
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:57,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully two out of three.

231
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had to swing my company's doing a...

232
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:02,552
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could go, but I don't know if I can.

234
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll bring cider for you.

235
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

236
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,396
[SPEAKER_03]: With alcohol and cider for me and the kids.

237
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:54,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, more details on that as PAX approaches.

238
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news.

239
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:01,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf says Scott is actually not going to be there because he's at Burning Man.

240
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:02,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait a minute.

241
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:04,666
[SPEAKER_03]: He's passing up PAX to go run naked in the desert?

242
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:05,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

243
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:06,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

244
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that sound fun?

245
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:08,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it does sound kind of fun.

246
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:09,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

247
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, blowing stuff up is pretty fun.

248
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,792
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, Burning Man does sound kind of cool.

249
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of the things I want to do at some point before I die is go to Burning Man at least once.

250
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:21,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though me plus sun equals not good.

251
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I get all gross and my skin doesn't.

252
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a redhead.

253
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say redheads don't do well in sun.

254
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,323
[SPEAKER_03]: He starts to melt.

255
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:30,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.

256
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,186
[SPEAKER_03]: If I went to Burning Man, I think I could only go for like a day.

257
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:34,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

258
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,208
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

259
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

260
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

261
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:20,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

262
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:23,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had some screenshots that leaked out there.

263
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I think scans from the issue.

264
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:26,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks cool.

265
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:27,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

266
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:30,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first female boss robot.

267
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

268
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:35,052
[SPEAKER_02]: They did have a list of the different boss men that you'd be fighting.

269
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:38,453
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Magma Man, Galaxy Man, Plug Man.

270
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:42,095
[SPEAKER_03]: What does Plug Man plug?

271
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:43,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a curiosity.

272
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Concrete Man and Splash Woman.

273
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:52,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Megan Esplash, the first female boss character.

274
00:17:53,038 --> 00:18:02,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think I heard, I don't know, I might be getting mixed up, but I think in Japan one of them was a woman in a prior game and it got somehow switched on the way over here to America.

275
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:05,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong on that, don't quote me on that, but I don't want to say somebody was telling me that.

276
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:14,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's still, what do you guys think about, this is interesting because Mega Man series is essentially taking a step backwards, but in a way it's a step forwards, right?

277
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome, I think it's a great idea.

278
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:17,842
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do that for more stuff.

279
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they kind of are.

280
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:22,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at Bionic Commando Rearmed.

281
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:30,591
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly as old school as Mega Man as far as the way they're doing it, but same type of thing.

282
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 2D game.

283
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:39,555
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of forget that a lot of times, even though we do have the technology to do 3D games and stuff, you don't always have to do that.

284
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.

285
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,016
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

286
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:42,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited about this?

287
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:44,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly so.

288
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:48,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear all the music is going to be 8-bit-ish and all that stuff.

289
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:48,795
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be great.

290
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:50,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

291
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,578
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Dark Knight in our chat room might not agree.

292
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst Mega Man boss names ever.

293
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

294
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man 2 and 3

295
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:36,038
[SPEAKER_03]: were probably the peak of the series, a lot of people would tell you.

296
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:40,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's some hardcore Mega Man people out there that are like, no, 7 or 5 or whatever.

297
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:46,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of us fondly, fondly remember 2 and 3, so that's kind of interesting they're going back.

298
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:50,442
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know I'm going to check it out, because if it's retro, hopefully that means it's cheap.

299
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:51,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like cheap.

300
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:54,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

301
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:15,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Defender Castle Awesome WiiWare game

302
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran said in chat, says soon we're going to have Pencil Man and Cloth Man.

303
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I don't know, Pencil Man might be kind of funny.

304
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he shoots erasers at you.

305
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:56,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like, okay, they've got to always have a, you know, a villain that's, you know, fire based.

306
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:59,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like running out of different words for fire in there.

307
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:04,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Magma Man and, you know, Fire Man, Heat Man, Hot Man.

308
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuego Man.

309
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:06,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuego Man.

310
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:07,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat Man was cool though.

311
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:09,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat Man was like the coolest of the...

312
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Heatman was pretty cool.

313
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:12,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old school.

314
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:13,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Fireman.

315
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,037
[SPEAKER_00]: But Heatman's only one game later.

316
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:20,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I say they make a new Mega Man game, just have all of the different bosses in there.

317
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all of them.

318
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:22,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Mega Man boss rush?

319
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just have, like, well, not necessarily playing all the bosses, but just have all the levels from all the other games, too.

320
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the Anniversary Collection should have been.

321
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:36,065
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the weapons from Mega Man 8 and Mega Man 1 and, you know, mix it all up.

322
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.

323
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:41,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ossifer makes the mandatory Boobie Man reference.

324
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,168
[SPEAKER_03]: J-Rod says Toaster Man.

325
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:44,659
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

326
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,141
[SPEAKER_03]: J-Rod says Powdered Toast Man.

327
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:46,802
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

328
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:48,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Powdered Toast Man.

329
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:49,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking that.

330
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:49,366
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

331
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:49,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough.

332
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough.

333
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:53,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want the chat room filling up with Blank Man or whatever there.

334
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:54,493
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

335
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:56,476
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Blank Man was already done.

336
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:58,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a Blank Man really?

337
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a Blank Man movie.

338
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: This place is thick with the stench of ghoul.

339
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:19,187
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

340
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:22,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Diablo 2 and Diablo 1, but much prettier.

341
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obvious that this game has evolved quite a bit.

342
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:33,330
[SPEAKER_03]: This game, of course, was unveiled at Blizzard's recent event over in France, the Worldwide Invitational, and tons of stuff was leaked.

343
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,911
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a trailer, there's this 20-minute gameplay clip we're looking at here in studio right now.

344
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,911
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think of Diablo 3?

345
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:43,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys don't play a whole lot of PC games, but what do you guys think?

346
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:44,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool.

347
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:46,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.

348
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:47,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to check it out.

349
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:49,364
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I never played any of the others, but I tried this one.

350
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:55,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of, I think, Diablo, like back in the day when I had the demo and stuff for it.

351
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:56,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fun.

352
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:02,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those games you could sit there and play for a while and you level up some and then stop and go back to it later.

353
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the whole grinding part of World of Warcraft, except you don't actually have any...

354
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:11,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as far as I'm aware, because I only played the demo, like, huge quests you have to go on.

355
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:13,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.

356
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, I'm super powerful now.

357
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill, kill, kill.

358
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:19,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do have quests, but part of the really cool thing about the old Diablos is that everything was randomized.

359
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd like to start today by introducing the Barbarian.

360
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn that off, because now the guy is talking about the Barbarian class.

361
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:30,117
[SPEAKER_03]: All the dungeons were randomized, so it was like you were playing a new game every time.

362
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:31,538
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of one of the cool things about it.

363
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:33,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Guild Wars does that.

364
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,540
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

365
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:36,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true, huh?

366
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:38,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very cool.

367
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,602
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I don't know.

368
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:40,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo is just different.

369
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo is not really an MMO, but it is something you can experience with tons of other people, which is kind of cool.

370
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the four-player co-op that they're going to have in there.

371
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:48,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

372
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:51,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Because didn't Diablo 2 only go up to two-player co-op, I think?

373
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:52,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

374
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

375
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,050
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

376
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 3 officially announced this week.

377
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's stuff all over the internet on this.

378
00:23:58,331 --> 00:24:01,272
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want the official word, Diablo3.com is where it's at.

379
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to any Blizzard site.

380
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:06,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole splash screen that was being teased all week long was there.

381
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:09,475
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as when this comes out, who knows?

382
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:11,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we still have StarCraft 2 on the list.

383
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:12,896
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have Wrath of the Lich King.

384
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:13,156
[SPEAKER_03]: When?

385
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometime.

386
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:19,148
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says it'll be on my Hanukkah list for 2011.

387
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not a bad bet.

388
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:23,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say maybe 2010.

389
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll get StarCraft 2 next year and probably Diablo 3 the year after.

390
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:30,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Diablo 3 will probably come out around the same time as StarCraft 2.

391
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you may have one in the fall, one in the spring.

392
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:38,925
[SPEAKER_03]: J-Rod says Diablo was cool until people started cheating to make their own loot.

393
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:42,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hear that's a real problem that plagued Diablo 2 on Battle.net.

394
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,751
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I don't like to play games except with friends.

395
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:46,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because I know that friends won't cheat.

396
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:47,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Or OLR listeners.

397
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:48,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

398
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:50,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cheating sometimes, it can be fun.

399
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, with Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert...

400
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that stuff, man.

401
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you found out about the whole rules I and I file and you can make your own units by combining stuff.

402
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:02,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That made the game even more fun for me.

403
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:07,308
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you and I agree, okay, we're going to play this game or we're going to cheat the hell out of it and just have fun with it.

404
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:08,049
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing.

405
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's cool because we're both on the same page.

406
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:21,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I've worked really hard to level this character and then some stranger pops in my room and dumps all this shit in my thing that he's cheated to get or shown off or whatever, that's just dumb.

407
00:25:21,718 --> 00:25:22,498
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

408
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:23,179
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you trying to prove?

409
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:39,569
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sort of the problem that we had I guess with the last Ragnarok server we were on that people were sort of exploiting a little problem in there duplicating items and things and messing up the economy and as a result all of us suffered for it you know so yeah cheaters suck

410
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's such a thing as appropriate cheating.

411
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:59,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what Matt's talking about, you know, like, you know, what they do at work and everything, when they're, you know, whatever, that's one thing, because you all agree you're going to cheat, and the whole point, you're having fun with the exploits, but, you know, these other a-holes that come on and try to ruin other people's, you know, legit experiences suck.

412
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:09,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say it's less of a cheat, more of a mod, because you're just modifying the game, and in order to play someone, because this was back in the day when I was playing someone Red Alert over, you know, a fucking modem.

413
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:21,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we would share the same file back and forth and then basically play this, you know, kind of hacked version on both computers, which was pretty fun, actually.

414
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:22,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with...

415
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:31,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I made the super fast tanks and Einstein that shot lightning and the suicide bombers and stuff like that.

416
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:32,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

417
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:38,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking in chat here, Hitstun says, Funny, I play with OLR listeners because they hack just as much as I do.

418
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:42,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, if you all agree you're going to hack, then that's one thing.

419
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just when you try to kind of cross the line there where you're an ass.

420
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,594
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to ruin other people's experience.

421
00:26:50,895 --> 00:26:52,596
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's... Hey, you know what?

422
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:56,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 3 is definitely... You think it's going to break the Diablo 2 record?

423
00:26:56,238 --> 00:27:01,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, if I remember right, Diablo 2 has the best PC game launch ever.

424
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:03,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Even above World of Warcraft.

425
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:05,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 2 sold like a million copies in its first week.

426
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:07,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Diablo 3 going to top that?

427
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:10,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is PC gaming dead?

428
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:11,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

429
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:22,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read enough fan-gasming on LiveJournal to make me think that if that's just a small portion of the community, I think that it would be big.

430
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's definitely going to give Diablo 2 a run for its money.

431
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think PC gaming is dead.

432
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:30,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's enough people... PC gaming is napping.

433
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:43,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think it's necessarily... There's certainly a hardcore audience very into PC gaming, but I'll tell you what, love them or hate them, whoever you are in the PC gaming community, Blizzard gets people to the PC.

434
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:45,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 3 coming soon.

435
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:16,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, going back to other Blizzard news, there were some people who were afraid that Diablo 3 would steal World of Warcraft players, but Blizzard really isn't worried about that because...

436
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:26,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is they're actually just not concerned about losing the revenue because if they go from one of their projects to another of their projects, they're still getting money from it.

437
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:36,100
[SPEAKER_00]: But they said that it's not going to be as big of a crossover between the communities because they're different types of game.

438
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,445
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do hope that plenty of the World of Warcraft players would be interested in Diablo 3.

439
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,710
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

440
00:28:58,197 --> 00:28:59,398
[SPEAKER_00]: No, probably not.

441
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:05,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't because Irene might call me and be all, Rob, Kara, and I'm going to have to drop Diablo 3 to go run Karazhan again.

442
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:10,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Curtis in chat is addressing the whole issue about PC gaming.

443
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:17,026
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I have Portal on my PC because unfortunately I'm still stuck with a PS2 and can't afford next gen.

444
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of people still doing PC gaming because of that, but I've got to be honest.

445
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:24,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at a game like Diablo 3 and I'm going...

446
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to have to upgrade my computer in order to be able to play that.

447
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:28,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

448
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:34,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard's sometimes pretty good at getting the tech requirements pretty low, but I'm a little worried I'm going to have to upgrade the computer to be able to play that.

449
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have to upgrade the computer, isn't that just like, you know, might as well buy a system?

450
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like buying a few systems.

451
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:46,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I understand that, you know, some people want to put it all in one, you know, then invest all the money in your best machine.

452
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:49,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a big reason why there are a lot of people really into PC gaming.

453
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:50,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of the same.

454
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing, yet opposite for me, because...

455
00:29:54,392 --> 00:30:04,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've upgraded my system, I have to buy more PC games because what's the point in upgrading it that much to play games if you're not going to play games on it?

456
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:34,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Blizzard is really going to be losing any WoW players to Diablo I don't think Blizzard will really start losing WoW players until other MMOs come out that really step up to challenge them which Age of Conan is probably done better than most so far and there's others I think Warhammer is going to be coming soon I've heard a lot of buzz about that and eventually WoW 2 or World of Starcraft which in 5 years is probably inevitable so we'll see what they need is like World of Dead or Alive keep on dreamin

457
00:30:35,163 --> 00:30:35,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Itagaki, man.

458
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:36,964
[SPEAKER_02]: He can do it.

459
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:48,230
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's going to be coming hopefully pretty soon here, and we've been hearing about this for a while now, is the trophy system for the PlayStation 3.

460
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of their answer to the achievements that are on Xbox 360.

461
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:58,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are some pictures that have leaked out, supposedly, of this trophy system.

462
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,177
[SPEAKER_02]: They show that you're actually not going to have gamer points.

463
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:22,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

465
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:42,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, it sounds like the achievement system, I don't know, it kind of reminds me of, like, Burnout.

466
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,971
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where, like, if you get a certain time, you get a gold.

467
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,655
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get a certain, you know, higher time, it's a silver, and so on, for a bronze.

468
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:51,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have that type of system.

469
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:56,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think what's going to be the difficulty for each trophy, it's not going to be like, you know...

470
00:31:57,894 --> 00:32:02,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, sort of like that, but you wouldn't be able to, like, say, get gold and then get all the trophies below it.

471
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:08,483
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be just, like, different things, like, finish level one, bronze trophy, finish the game, you know, gold trophy or something like that.

472
00:32:08,503 --> 00:32:08,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

473
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:12,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Reading some more comments from chat, chat.orangelunchradio.com, live on this Sunday night.

474
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: J-Rod says, trophies and achievements, god no, I can't juggle that between two systems.

475
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievement whore!

476
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

477
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't Conan equal World of Dead or Alive?

478
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:38,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Parts.

479
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:39,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Parts.

480
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:05,636
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's inevitable that God of War 3 is going to come out sometime for the PlayStation 3.

481
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,498
[SPEAKER_03]: But were you guys thinking that it might be this soon?

482
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:18,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently one of the Eurogamer affiliates, Eurogamer.pt, has run a report that God of War 3 is going to be shown at E3 this next month.

483
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:22,989
[SPEAKER_03]: This was from a Sony rep at the Interactive Digital Entertainment.

484
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,990
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

485
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,882
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

486
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:21,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of see this, if a trailer is unveiled, which I don't see why it wouldn't be because this is one of Sony's biggest franchises, it's going to be in the vein of the early, early Halo 3 trailers where it's going to show you like, you know, there's going to be some epic music and then, you know, some girl talking like, you know, in a land far away.

487
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:22,188
[SPEAKER_03]: We need your help.

488
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And whatever shit they're going to talk in the thing.

489
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:28,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll see suddenly at the very end of the trailer, Kratos' face in HD.

490
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be like, oh my god, fangasm!

491
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:32,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And then God of War 3, 2009.

492
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:34,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be it.

493
00:34:35,354 --> 00:34:38,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's kind of predictable at this point.

494
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:43,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Or then again, if it is Sony, they could say it's coming out this Christmas and then just keep pushing it back until it gets to Christmas 2009.

495
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:46,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the Sony way, isn't it?

496
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:55,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about the other rumor that they're saying that Kratos is going to be a hidden character in Soul Calibur 4 on the PlayStation 3?

497
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I had heard that.

498
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:59,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was on the lineup for tonight, but it got cut because we're going to be long otherwise.

499
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'd heard about that.

500
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that weird?

501
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:02,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be interesting.

502
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:07,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be something that they could probably slip in there for E3 or whatever since the game comes out a few weeks after that.

503
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:12,068
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would think, if that is true, wouldn't a word of that already slip out somehow?

504
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:12,848
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.

505
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:19,751
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been announcing stuff each week, like little tidbits, doing different screens.

506
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about the tag system that's supposedly in there now.

507
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:35,276
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another thing I saw the other day for the character creator, where you can basically create... Someone made a solid snake, or old snake, basically, and Ryu...

508
00:35:37,697 --> 00:35:41,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryu from Ninja Gaiden.

509
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,082
[SPEAKER_03]: FearTheClaw in chat says that's three games in three years.

510
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:45,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Tony Hawk or Madden.

511
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:51,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm thinking, wait a minute, there's the PSP one, but J-Rod jumps in and says, yeah, but the PSP one doesn't count for most people.

512
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:53,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard the PSP one was actually pretty good.

513
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:54,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play it myself.

514
00:35:54,491 --> 00:36:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really in the God of War, but... I can see them probably will port the PSP one to the PlayStation 2 before the third one comes out.

515
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:02,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, we'll see.

516
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: because they've been doing that quite often.

517
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:08,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's inevitable God of War 3 at some point.

518
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:11,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just see if we get a teaser at E3 or not.

519
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:17,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is some other news that should probably be pretty exciting.

520
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:22,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually kind of excited about this.

521
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:31,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo Power put up an image of a photo taken of the Castlevania game for Wii and it looks like a fighting game.

522
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:51,097
[SPEAKER_00]: and not a platformer but it said so far you should be able to well at least it's rumored that you should be able to play Simon, Alucard, Shanoa, Marie Renard and Dracula it better have Richter in it that's all I'm saying

523
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But doesn't it look like a fighting game?

524
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:54,947
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a fighting game.

525
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like Soul Calibur.

526
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:58,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this Konami's response to Soul Calibur?

527
00:36:59,128 --> 00:36:59,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

528
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:04,070
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 calls it Fightervania and then facepalms in our chatroom.

529
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Castlevania Judgment, I think was the name of the name.

530
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:10,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to play it.

531
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:21,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my quandary with this is that this looks like one of those things that could be really, really, really freaking awesome or really, really, really terrible.

532
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:22,622
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

533
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:31,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just kind of worried it's going to be terrible, but I'm hopeful because these are some great characters in a great franchise.

534
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:34,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon's got pretty hair and shapely legs.

535
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:41,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't most of the Castlevania characters play kind of similar?

536
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,124
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to differentiate all these different characters?

537
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Richter had different moves.

538
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember he had the backwards double jump?

539
00:37:51,176 --> 00:38:00,464
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go by Symphony of the Night, he had the double jump, and then the one where he leaps up, and then the backflip that would let you go an extra space and a half.

540
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:06,169
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put Maria in it, I don't know if she'd have her crybaby attack from when she was a little girl.

541
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:08,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see a screenshot that they had Maria in it.

542
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:12,015
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a second screenshot that was floating around out there also.

543
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:20,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would be kind of cool is if certain boss characters were kind of downgraded to, you know, the playable fighters in this.

544
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:25,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could like play as the Grim Reaper or you could play as, I don't know, the Vampire Bat, maybe not.

545
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Medusa or, you know, some of those like old school Castlevania bosses.

546
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be kind of fun.

547
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:30,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just me?

548
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:33,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be fun to play as like the Grim Reaper as a character.

549
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... Or Dracula.

550
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that if Dracula is in it, Dracula is in it as a boss.

551
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Bosses are always playable once you unlock them, though.

552
00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:45,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, I know.

553
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:46,379
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have Shaft.

554
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,840
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dark Priest Shaft.

555
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:58,086
[SPEAKER_00]: And their little text exchange should be like, he's like, yeah, we hear you're one bad, and then he says, shut your mouth.

556
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:04,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that they have horrendous voice acting, like the old school PlayStation Symphony of the Night game.

557
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,170
[SPEAKER_03]: That would rock.

558
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:11,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that Simon had pretty hair in that one picture.

559
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:14,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine this is something that we'll get a trailer of at E3.

560
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:18,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll get a little more feeling about if this is going to suck or not.

561
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:25,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm hopeful, but it's one of those things where it's like, boy, they could really screw this up if they wanted to.

562
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope they took the time to get it right.

563
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:27,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

564
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:34,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and unfortunately I can't see that the track record for spin-off games have been that great, especially on the Wii.

565
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,201
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

566
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the Tekken game?

567
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:02,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, there was the spinoff with Nina, right?

568
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:03,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Death by Degrees.

569
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That was shit.

570
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:10,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Guilty Gear 2 Overture.

571
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:15,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright, but it's kind of like 99 Nights a bit.

572
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think if there's another one there.

573
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:26,206
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, I want to play as Grant from Castlevania 3.

574
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,728
[SPEAKER_03]: He can climb on the freaking walls and ceiling.

575
00:40:29,188 --> 00:40:32,390
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Japanese version, instead of just stabbing with the knife, he actually threw knives.

576
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,617
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this... That would have been a lot better.

577
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:37,379
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the kind of characters that need to be in the game.

578
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:45,727
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I say, you know, we might be talking negatively about this game already because we're very cautious, but by all means, please, Konami, prove us wrong.

579
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:48,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Make us eat our words, please.

580
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Please feel free.

581
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:50,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

582
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:55,377
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics don't look that bad, so if they wanted to do, say, another 2D Castlevania game for the Wii...

583
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:58,025
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

584
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:20,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, today you have Guitar Hero Aerosmith, which I'm sure a lot of people picked up.

585
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:24,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than today, there's really a whole lot of nothing.

586
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:28,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Elements on PC, which is some puzzle game.

587
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:32,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Supreme Ruler 2020, also another PC game.

588
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:33,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a strategy title.

589
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:36,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see...

590
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:59,996
[SPEAKER_02]: The Immortals of Terra I have no idea what that is Journey to the Center of the Earth for the DS which is based on the new movie that's coming out here they keep trailering like crazy 1 vs 100 the only game with Bob Saget in it it's for the DS until they make a full house game

591
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, which will never happen.

592
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Rugu on PC.

593
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:05,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops, sorry about that.

594
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at a banner ad.

595
00:42:07,145 --> 00:42:08,806
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn these banner ads that make noise.

596
00:42:08,846 --> 00:42:09,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

597
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:11,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Rugu on PC.

598
00:42:11,688 --> 00:42:13,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool little independent game, so that's worth checking out.

599
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,911
[SPEAKER_02]: PurrPals on the Wii.

600
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, another cat raising sim or cats raising you sim.

601
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:24,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Gears of War, the refresh as they're calling it.

602
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:28,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically the re-release of Gears of War with some extra content and a new price point of $39.99.

603
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:30,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the 360.

604
00:42:32,122 --> 00:42:36,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Dekatimoto on the DS, a motorcycle racing game.

605
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:41,485
[SPEAKER_02]: AMF Bullying Pinbusters, that's on the DS as well.

606
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:45,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Hail to the Chimp on the PS3.

607
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:52,727
[SPEAKER_02]: The only game that's actually cool this week, Trauma Center Under the Knife 2, coming out for the DS.

608
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:56,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

609
00:42:58,755 --> 00:42:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

610
00:42:59,936 --> 00:43:00,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Some comments from chat.

611
00:43:01,577 --> 00:43:04,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Kdog96 asks, hasn't 1 vs. 100 been cancelled?

612
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:05,961
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

613
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:07,482
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think the show was.

614
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:08,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the show?

615
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:12,366
[SPEAKER_03]: The TV show was, but if they made the game, I think they're kind of stuck releasing it.

616
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:14,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the game's been pushed back a while now.

617
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:16,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Some comments on Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

618
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,652
[SPEAKER_03]: DeadmanWalking in chat says, Guitar Hero Aerosmith is awful.

619
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:25,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Jrod says, Guitar Hero Aerosmith has a great track list, but I can't get myself to support Activision milking that franchise.

620
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:27,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

621
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:35,007
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a large part of me that really wants to get Guitar Hero Aerosmith, but I cannot justify $60 on it.

622
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:35,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't.

623
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping it comes down in price soon.

624
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:38,908
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come play it at my house.

625
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:41,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, because Dan's going to get it, huh?

626
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:41,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

627
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:47,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a good thing that they're releasing music games and stuff like that, but I think more than one release a year is too much.

628
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:52,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with DDR, if they were releasing two or three games a year, that would be overkill, I think.

629
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:54,613
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's head on.

630
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:55,073
[SPEAKER_03]: D-Extreme Stage

631
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check out some of the other systems.

632
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:24,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's nothing coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

633
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:32,889
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Wii, Akodepan Ikisama Horoyuki is coming out, and Jawa Mammoth Tohitsumu no Ishii is also coming out.

634
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what either of those games are, but I imagine Akodepan is probably some type of puzzle game, if I'm not mistaken.

635
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:43,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like... Oh, it's a board game.

636
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So, board game translation for the Nintendo Wii.

637
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:49,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not a game we really play here on this side of the ocean.

638
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the handheld system.

639
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, quickly looking at PlayStation 2.

640
00:44:53,682 --> 00:44:55,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other price reductions there.

641
00:44:56,925 --> 00:45:03,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, El Nokitsu 2 Invisible Memories comes out on the PlayStation 2.

642
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:06,372
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a limited edition as well.

643
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an adventure game.

644
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:12,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't tell much about this, but it has schoolgirls in it.

645
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that could be anything.

646
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

647
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:16,841
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be anything, seriously.

648
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:22,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the handhelds, because there's usually stuff on the Nintendo DS, even in a slow news week.

649
00:45:25,004 --> 00:45:33,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see a lot of big game names here, but I do show a game called Nanashi no Game from Square Enix is coming out.

650
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to figure out what that game is.

651
00:45:35,888 --> 00:45:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Action adventure game.

652
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:39,911
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

653
00:46:04,757 --> 00:46:10,281
[SPEAKER_03]: with a touch panel on one side for the game and the other side showing a full body view of your dancer and her competition.

654
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

655
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a dance music game.

656
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:20,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, on the PSP in Japan this week, looking to see if there's anything new.

657
00:46:21,189 --> 00:46:25,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bleach, Heat the Soul 4 gets a price reduction and moves into best hits.

658
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:32,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Namco Museum Battle Collection expands into an Asia-wide release this week, not just Japan.

659
00:46:32,117 --> 00:46:32,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, more Bleach.

660
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:40,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I have a friend who's touring around in Japan right now, and he asked me if I wanted anything from Japan.

661
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to have him pick me up a copy on PlayStation 3 of Battle Fantasia, which is that really cool-looking fighting game.

662
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:49,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to play that.

663
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:51,600
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my other friends is planning on importing it.

664
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I get that and I can bring it in and we can do it on JustinTV or something.

665
00:46:57,118 --> 00:47:03,568
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, in two weeks in Japan, since we were talking about God of War earlier, God of War Chains of Olympus finally comes out in Japan on July 10th.

666
00:47:03,629 --> 00:47:04,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to look forward to there.

667
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:05,452
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

668
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:06,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan release dates.

669
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:12,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the UK, there's a few things.

670
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:38,718
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 30th, actually, GoView is coming out for PSP, and then with the start of the month, we've got on the 2nd, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party on Wii, Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3 for PlayStation 3 on the 3rd, and then on the 4th is Arkanoid DS, Space Invaders Extreme for DS and PSP, The Incredible Hulk on Wii, and Wall-E on damn near everything else, and we love golf!

671
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, it's not Dancing Stage Hottest Party?

672
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,020
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Dance Dance Revolution.

673
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,221
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of strange.

674
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:49,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I thought they called it Dancing Stage over there.

675
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:51,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it that they call it Dancing Stage over there anyways?

676
00:47:51,883 --> 00:47:55,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Revolution is a taboo term to use in marketing from what I understand.

677
00:47:57,326 --> 00:47:57,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I know why.

678
00:47:58,026 --> 00:48:00,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm right, also back in the 80s you actually couldn't use Ninja.

679
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:05,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.

680
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:08,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We got weird stuff over here too.

681
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:13,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, like, you know, fag is a cigarette over there.

682
00:48:13,316 --> 00:48:14,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But over here it means something much different.

683
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:15,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

684
00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:16,398
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little things.

685
00:48:16,418 --> 00:48:17,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bundle of sticks.

686
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:17,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

687
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

688
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:21,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolution.

689
00:48:23,602 --> 00:48:25,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Wario Land Shake It

690
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:46,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Paper Mario Kirby Super Star Ultra DS Remake Super Nintendo Game

691
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:11,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

692
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the one with all the minigames in it?

693
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also got minigames in it, yeah.

694
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:15,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

695
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

696
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also... I had that game.

697
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:23,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystery Case Files Millionaire.

698
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, error as in, you know, errors.

699
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:33,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, and that is a mystery game that I guess is a PC franchise that they're now bringing to the DS.

700
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, let's see, I believe...

701
00:49:38,906 --> 00:49:52,715
[SPEAKER_02]: September 25th for Kirby Superstar Ultra and September 29th for Mystery Case Files Millionaire and I want to say that Wario...

702
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,401
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

703
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So their November and December releases are still a question mark.

704
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:24,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So there might be some big bombshell in there.

705
00:50:24,348 --> 00:50:26,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't really even end in October.

706
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:28,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends basically at October.

707
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:30,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's all September stuff.

708
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:31,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't know.

709
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:33,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Wario sounds kind of cool.

710
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirby sure has a lot of diehard fans.

711
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:39,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's not really that OMG title in there.

712
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's also weird?

713
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is weird for Nintendo.

714
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Nintendo usually releases their games on Sundays.

715
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:48,505
[SPEAKER_02]: They're switching to Tuesdays now.

716
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're finally getting normal like everybody else.

717
00:50:51,754 --> 00:50:52,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I guess.

718
00:50:52,455 --> 00:50:52,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them.

719
00:50:54,196 --> 00:51:07,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, switching over to the Xbox 360 for a minute, it's been speculated for a while that one of the things that they are going to announce at E3, along with all that news that got leaked last month, or no, it was about two weeks ago, was the price drop.

720
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:12,508
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360, any day now, should be getting some type of price drop, and it looks like

721
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It might happen at E3 that they might walk out there on stage and they're going to say we are dropping the price of the Xbox 360.

722
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:25,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what happened to make us all think that is that apparently a Kmart ad has leaked.

723
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Kmart ad that is actually supposed to hit on July 6th.

724
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:40,710
[SPEAKER_03]: and this ad shows that there is an Xbox 360 20 gig console, meaning it comes with the hard drive, $299.99 and it's being advertised as a new low price.

725
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Also supporting the fact that this ad is for the week of July 6th, you see a little box art for Civilization Revolution, it's a game that's coming out that week, that is a game that's scheduled to be out that week, so very interesting that this could be seeing a $50 price drop from the current $349 that folks are paying for this system.

726
00:51:58,301 --> 00:51:59,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know if it's

727
00:51:59,662 --> 00:52:00,262
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

728
00:52:17,298 --> 00:52:20,179
[SPEAKER_00]: But did nobody shop at Kmart?

729
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:20,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

730
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:26,940
[SPEAKER_03]: But if this is true, then people are going to price match and what have you.

731
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to all of a sudden drop their systems down for whatever.

732
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:32,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says new low price.

733
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:34,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying on sale.

734
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:41,323
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, do we get a Rock Us Dukakis t-shirt with our purchase of a 360 at Kmart?

735
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:43,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

736
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:44,024
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

737
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:44,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I want one of those shirts.

738
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:47,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

739
00:52:47,188 --> 00:52:48,269
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to buy some mold.

740
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:50,951
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a moldy Xbox 360, that's the thing.

741
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:55,836
[SPEAKER_03]: If Kmart ends up selling these, it better be for an old skewer.

742
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:59,440
[SPEAKER_03]: How's Kmart going to get rid of all the 360s that have been sitting on their shelves since launch?

743
00:53:00,181 --> 00:53:01,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nobody shops at Kmart.

744
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,985
[SPEAKER_03]: They get price matched.

745
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:04,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

746
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:06,067
[SPEAKER_03]: They get all that stuff on the back end.

747
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:06,547
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

748
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:32,907
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look, and I don't even know why I looked at this when I was looking at this ad here, they have a high-res scan on Joystick.

749
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:41,031
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the very bottom left-hand corner, it says job number 713, so that's when the ad is supposed to hit.

750
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:47,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feeling somebody else, another retailer, will leak a very similar thing this week, and that's when you know it's the real deal.

751
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already on board saying it's the real deal.

752
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:58,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at what was it last year with the whole, I think the first price drop, and also there was the PlayStation 3 stuff too.

753
00:53:58,881 --> 00:54:03,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was some sort of price drop or SKU announcement or something like that that was leaked by that.

754
00:54:03,384 --> 00:54:03,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

755
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:06,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the 80 gig or something.

756
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you have it.

757
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,187
[SPEAKER_03]: A price drop coming soon.

758
00:54:09,227 --> 00:54:16,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't bought an Xbox 360 yet and you want to, and I say this because we've had some mailbag people write us recently wondering if they should take the plunge and get one now.

759
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:22,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should wait now a couple weeks before this price drop unless you go to a store that's going to honor.

760
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:28,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes stores, like if the price changes within a month, they will give you a refund.

761
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:31,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather just not risk it and just buy it.

762
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:32,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait a few more days.

763
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:33,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeks.

764
00:54:33,595 --> 00:54:36,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait a couple more weeks and I think you will be good.

765
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:38,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you might have a reason to shop at Kmart.

766
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:41,699
[SPEAKER_00]: A reason to shop at Kmart.

767
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:43,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick up some of that hip 80s fashion while you're there.

768
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bought something at Kmart a year ago.

769
00:54:47,481 --> 00:54:52,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought something at Kmart once in the past three years and that's because they were the only place open on Thanksgiving.

770
00:54:52,983 --> 00:54:54,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought cereal there.

771
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:55,989
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

772
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:13,851
[SPEAKER_02]: You're nasty!

773
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:54,265
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know we went in there buying okay we only need aluminum foil and like you know a snack and then that's it we ended up walking out with like aluminum or not even aluminum foil because we forgot to get that obviously but we walked out with like bagel bites and like clothes and like all sorts of random shit it's like what the hell what is wrong with this I did buy something important there what I bought flannel sheets for my massage class

774
00:55:56,312 --> 00:56:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost live literally next door to a freaking Walmart and I don't go there unless I have to because it's scary.

775
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:11,377
[SPEAKER_03]: That Walmart is scary.

776
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:12,637
[SPEAKER_00]: The Walmart by my house is cool.

777
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:13,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, did you see this?

778
00:56:13,978 --> 00:56:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Right over there by the freeway they are opening up a Hooters right by my house.

779
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:17,119
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go!

780
00:56:18,186 --> 00:56:20,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we should do our OLR 300th episode live at Hooters.

781
00:56:21,407 --> 00:56:22,007
Let's do it!

782
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:23,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, let's do it.

783
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:24,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.

784
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:26,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll have to look into it.

785
00:56:26,988 --> 00:56:29,308
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not eating hot wings because their hot wings taste like shit.

786
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:33,509
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to see if they have the facilities for that and if they're not going to charge us too much.

787
00:56:33,549 --> 00:56:37,689
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, I kind of like that idea of doing our 300th episode live from Hooters.

788
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:40,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to see.

789
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,491
[SPEAKER_03]: PKJr92 asks, How is it scary, Rob?

790
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:46,191
[SPEAKER_03]: The Walmart over here just said...

791
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,631
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always people outside asking for money.

792
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a good way to describe it.

793
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:55,192
[SPEAKER_03]: When you walk in there, it smells like formaldehyde.

794
00:56:55,452 --> 00:56:56,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good way to describe it.

795
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:56,932
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

796
00:56:57,392 --> 00:57:00,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the oldest Walmart in the South.

797
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:04,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And then transpose it to California.

798
00:57:05,014 --> 00:57:06,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite as bad.

799
00:57:06,414 --> 00:57:07,934
[SPEAKER_00]: The floors are at least white.

800
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:11,535
[SPEAKER_00]: But the quality of consumer...

801
00:57:12,584 --> 00:57:17,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, I think the Kmart locally here is a little bit more ahead of the times than the Walmart next door.

802
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:24,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, the only difference between Walmarts and Kmarts is Kmart, you have to step on the pad to open the door instead of, you know, the infrared.

803
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:25,993
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

804
00:57:26,553 --> 00:57:27,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough Kmart chat.

805
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:28,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to gaming news.

806
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:30,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

807
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:30,916
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta.

808
00:57:32,277 --> 00:57:32,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta.

809
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Tommy is waiting to come on our show.

810
00:57:34,398 --> 00:57:34,978
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta get to him.

811
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:46,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, hey, we've got some other stuff that's pretty crap news for our friends in the UK.

812
00:57:47,282 --> 00:57:52,365
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to introduce a dual rating system for rating games.

813
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:59,830
[SPEAKER_00]: One that's the, if I'm right, it's the PEGI, and the other one then to go with the BBFC.

814
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:00,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And...

815
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:18,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they were talking about the games that were rated 12 plus or above by the PEGI should also be rated by the BBFC, the British Board of Film Classification to also include that, which right now they only rate the 15 and 18.

816
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:34,781
[SPEAKER_00]: But Microsoft is actually saying that it's going to make the games more expensive because they have to submit them through both rating systems as well as delay their releases.

817
00:58:35,882 --> 00:58:37,503
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have to be approved by both.

818
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:57,740
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, to pretty much quote, it was actually said by Neil Thompson, who was one of the executives there, that, quote, we're concerned with any measures that would mean this process is made more unwieldy or incurs additional costs which have to be shared with the consumer.

819
00:58:58,741 --> 00:59:03,705
[SPEAKER_00]: So... So...

820
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,870
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of crap, don't you think?

821
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of sucks that they have to do two.

822
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:13,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't understand why you just can't stick with one rating system.

823
00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:14,153
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?

824
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:16,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like, well, we need to rate it too.

825
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:18,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

826
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:20,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Then just have them rate everything.

827
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:22,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Get rid of the Peggy system.

828
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:28,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why we can't do this in America and why they can't do it everywhere else.

829
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:32,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever has a movie rating system, apply it to the games.

830
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need an ESRB.

831
00:59:37,935 --> 00:59:42,320
[SPEAKER_00]: If people can understand what movie ratings are about, then apply it to video games as well.

832
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,002
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stupid.

833
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:45,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

834
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are even dumber than that, so they won't understand.

835
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:51,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

836
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:56,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So yet another Microsoft rumor we've got here.

837
00:59:57,769 --> 00:59:59,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of interesting.

838
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, the source is not entirely credible.

839
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:05,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So take this with a huge grain of salt.

840
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:17,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, this was apparently found from the 4chan forums, which I know they probably already... Wow, that's the most respectable news source I've ever heard on this show.

841
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, I know.

842
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But just...

843
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:22,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reporting it, that's all.

844
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:26,944
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two screenshots that supposedly leaked from 4chan.

845
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:27,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, it's weird.

846
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:30,226
[SPEAKER_02]: With MyGamerPad.

847
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:35,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically kind of like Microsoft's version of Home, it looks like.

848
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:37,690
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the avatars.

849
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:45,514
[SPEAKER_02]: This one screenshot shows that you can invite friends, change your wardrobe, furnishings, etc.

850
01:00:47,675 --> 01:00:48,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

851
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:51,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The logo for it looks like it's drawn in crayon.

852
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:53,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

853
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So, big grain of salt.

854
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:56,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

855
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:58,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Big grain of salt with that.

856
01:00:58,772 --> 01:01:00,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's really an... Excuse me, I'm choking.

857
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:01,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

858
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:01,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

859
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:08,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so who knows?

860
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:20,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could be very well photoshopped, but with these kind of announcements that we've been hearing and leaks and stuff about their avatar system and stuff like that, I could definitely see them doing something like this.

861
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:26,867
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the minute you said, and I'm trying to think of the nicest way to say this, but I can't really think of anything.

862
01:01:28,028 --> 01:01:34,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The minute you said this news comes to us from the 4chan forums, the biggest grain of salt fell from the heavens.

863
01:01:37,434 --> 01:02:01,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Dumped here in studio When you said that When I think news I think CNN MSNBC I don't think 4chan Just saying In case it actually becomes true Exactly I love this comment from Jrod in chat 4chan?

864
01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:02,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Photoshop?

865
01:02:02,979 --> 01:02:05,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Never I know, I know

866
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:16,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case it's true, you heard it here first.

867
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:21,379
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not true, you heard it on the Bobby Blackwolf show.

868
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:24,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidding, Bobby.

869
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:26,503
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be a new commercial for us.

870
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:33,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for us to do something here on OLR we haven't done in a while.

871
01:02:38,063 --> 01:02:39,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's dance, no.

872
01:02:40,325 --> 01:02:46,950
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a stupid award giveaway tonight, and tonight it's not because of any hideous shooting or anything, thankfully.

873
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is just no plain stupidity.

874
01:02:50,412 --> 01:02:56,937
[SPEAKER_03]: The news comes to us from the New Haven Advocate, and it is about the Connecticut State Senator Gail Schlossberg.

875
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:02,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Gail Schlossberg is looking for the rape scene in Grand Theft Auto 4.

876
01:03:04,122 --> 01:03:21,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And going to the actual news article here on NewHavenAdvocate.com She wants confirmation of the rumored rape scene in Grand Theft Auto 4 She is unable, though, to reach that level of the game Hmm, could it possibly be because, I don't know, it doesn't exist?

877
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:30,443
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's not willing to believe that But she just doesn't believe it Surely, this is a Grand Theft, surely there must be rape

878
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:37,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, she was putting out a request that someone proved to her that it's not in there.

879
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:41,215
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of fucked up logic is that?

880
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:43,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Prove your innocence!

881
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Prove that there is no rape in your game.

882
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Need I say more?

883
01:03:52,781 --> 01:03:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an idiot.

884
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,202
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why politicians suck.

885
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all, but most.

886
01:04:00,565 --> 01:04:01,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one.

887
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,481
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck once they get to a certain level.

888
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let us know when you find that scene.

889
01:04:06,702 --> 01:04:12,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but the funny thing is that she's going to be going around forever and ever trying to find that scene and she never will.

890
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:15,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So, heaven forbid she actually gets some work done.

891
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:20,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, speaking of Grand Theft Auto 4 though, I did see the most hilarious thing in that.

892
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:22,207
[SPEAKER_00]: The lap dances.

893
01:04:23,768 --> 01:04:24,008
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

894
01:04:24,248 --> 01:04:24,928
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hilarious.

895
01:04:25,788 --> 01:04:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so badly animated.

896
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:33,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, she's going to find the lost city of gold before she finds that rape scene in there.

897
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:36,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she can find a balanced budget for the state of Connecticut.

898
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they have the budget problems we do in California.

899
01:04:39,095 --> 01:04:43,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But if this were coming from a California senator, I would be going through the freaking roof.

900
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:45,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they cannot balance a fucking budget in this state.

901
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be in the middle of the roof right now.

902
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, Connecticut, do you really need to lower yourself to Delaware's level?

903
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:52,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

904
01:04:53,985 --> 01:04:54,325
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

905
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:55,986
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

906
01:04:56,086 --> 01:04:58,167
[SPEAKER_03]: News like this makes us... You know what?

907
01:04:58,207 --> 01:04:58,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.

908
01:04:58,527 --> 01:04:59,567
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the FUs of the week.

909
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,550
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to me for using the wrong music tonight.

910
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, a bit of retroness for you guys.

911
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:12,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

912
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:15,132
[SPEAKER_00]: FU, Rob.

913
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:19,433
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few, so I'll try to get through them as quickly as possible.

914
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:22,594
[SPEAKER_00]: FU to me for...

915
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:28,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Being so out of it that I made an error in the email.

916
01:05:29,684 --> 01:05:30,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't elaborate more.

917
01:05:32,286 --> 01:05:33,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, F you to my body.

918
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:40,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got really sick on Thursday night.

919
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, technically Friday morning.

920
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:45,115
[SPEAKER_00]: With some pretty nasty pain in my stomach.

921
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really bad.

922
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:48,777
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into details because it was fairly disgusting.

923
01:05:49,938 --> 01:05:53,781
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ended up going into the doctor on Friday.

924
01:05:54,682 --> 01:06:06,555
[SPEAKER_00]: and being tested for a peptic ulcer and a few other stomach related problems and got put on quite a number of drugs to help with digestive issues.

925
01:06:07,536 --> 01:06:08,537
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is addictive.

926
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:10,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun!

927
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:12,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know, so I have to be very careful.

928
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:16,091
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, and then I'm also being treated for sinus infection.

929
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've had smoke!

930
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:19,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

931
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:21,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty bad, awful smoke from the fire.

932
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it up in Placer County?

933
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:24,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Fires are, like, all over.

934
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:25,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's surrounding.

935
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:31,196
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fires up in the mountains to Reno, there's fires up in the mountains to the bay, there's fires up north in Chico.

936
01:06:31,236 --> 01:06:32,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's no fires to the south.

937
01:06:32,836 --> 01:06:33,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the only safe place.

938
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:34,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Head south.

939
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:38,160
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had any true blue skies in a while.

940
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:42,124
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had sort of a dusty brown color.

941
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:47,508
[SPEAKER_03]: True story, if you go onto the Wii forecast channel, at least yesterday, it actually said haze.

942
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:51,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And it showed that disgusting brown colored cloud for our weather.

943
01:06:51,852 --> 01:06:53,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the first time I've ever seen that in this area.

944
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:55,599
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just nasty.

945
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:02,585
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is that basically we've all been, you know, inhaling, you know, very fine soot, you know, in our air.

946
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not the only one.

947
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:11,233
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have developed sinus infections just from the damage, you know, caused from inhaling this day in and day out.

948
01:07:11,954 --> 01:07:15,797
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, F you to fires.

949
01:07:16,918 --> 01:07:19,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I normally like fire, F you to fires on that scale.

950
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:27,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Frisbee activated in our Justin.TV chat the weather function, because you can type weather and where we're at.

951
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:32,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And the official weather on Justin.TV says it's currently 83 degrees Fahrenheit.

952
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:33,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Conditions?

953
01:07:33,356 --> 01:07:33,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke.

954
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:38,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and today's actually a lot prettier than it has been.

955
01:07:38,699 --> 01:07:38,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

956
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:46,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is a lot nicer, but on top of that, though, we've had cooler weather because of the haze.

957
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:51,682
[SPEAKER_00]: However, though, at the hottest part of the day, it has trapped plenty of heat.

958
01:07:52,562 --> 01:07:55,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and our hottest part of the day is like, what is it, 3, 4 o'clock?

959
01:07:55,763 --> 01:07:56,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, about 4.

960
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:56,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

961
01:07:57,143 --> 01:07:58,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Right when the show starts, about 5.

962
01:07:59,671 --> 01:08:14,883
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's it's been on the not fun level and people have been getting sick from it so big F you goes to the the fires and good luck to the people who actually live in those areas yeah definitely um i used to live up in chico where a lot of those fires are happening in that area and i know

963
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:17,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Friends of friends that have been affected.

964
01:08:17,783 --> 01:08:18,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just sucks.

965
01:08:18,643 --> 01:08:20,184
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no real other way to put it.

966
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:20,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

967
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:25,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going to Julian, which is right outside San Diego, up in the mountains.

968
01:08:26,827 --> 01:08:30,668
[SPEAKER_00]: After they had the big bad forest fires there in the mountains.

969
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:33,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing what happened to one of the mountain towns.

970
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:35,410
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just gone.

971
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,851
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see foundations.

972
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:38,371
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole place was gone.

973
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:43,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So having seen what happens right after the fire, I just hope that everyone comes through it okay.

974
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:46,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well that is it for your FUs.

975
01:08:46,697 --> 01:08:47,257
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to Loki.

976
01:09:02,577 --> 01:09:04,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's forecast is noobs I bought.

977
01:09:06,879 --> 01:09:13,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess FU, this is not a really big FU because I'm not buying them this year, but FU is the safe and sane fireworks.

978
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Each year they get worse and worse.

979
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:15,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safe and lame.

980
01:09:16,145 --> 01:09:16,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Safe and lame, yeah.

981
01:09:17,405 --> 01:09:18,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm shipping me some Roman cans.

982
01:09:19,026 --> 01:09:21,447
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, Arnold is basically saying, don't buy them.

983
01:09:22,227 --> 01:09:30,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, no one's supposed to buy them because apparently, according to him, anyone that sets off fireworks immediately sets off forest fires.

984
01:09:30,669 --> 01:09:32,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're like, don't fire!

985
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you've seen these people.

986
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen these people.

987
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,131
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that are like, don't fire!

988
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:44,572
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to listen to Arnold because they're going to be like, I ain't listening to that European.

989
01:09:45,012 --> 01:09:45,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do what I want.

990
01:09:46,032 --> 01:09:46,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm American.

991
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:48,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Right Bear Firearms!

992
01:09:49,173 --> 01:09:51,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And fire is part of that, so... I'm gonna set my arm on fire.

993
01:09:51,594 --> 01:09:53,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go fire a gun for the 4th of July.

994
01:09:53,614 --> 01:09:55,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fire guns in the air instead.

995
01:09:55,715 --> 01:09:57,596
[SPEAKER_02]: No, um... No, don't.

996
01:09:57,616 --> 01:09:58,556
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really dangerous.

997
01:09:58,596 --> 01:09:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.

998
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:01,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no one can get killed by that.

999
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:03,298
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it in Mythbusters.

1000
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:03,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened.

1001
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:04,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whatever.

1002
01:10:05,058 --> 01:10:08,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so, um... Yeah, F you that because those suck.

1003
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:09,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead, we're gonna play video games.

1004
01:10:11,906 --> 01:10:12,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it for you, FU's of the Week?

1005
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:13,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1006
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:15,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll make mine fast, because this is almost over.

1007
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the fact that when I went to Great America, the best ride at all of Great America was fucking closed on my birthday, and that would be Top Gun.

1008
01:10:21,755 --> 01:10:24,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me, Flight Deck, because they lost all the licensing.

1009
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to point out the Survivor ride is still cool, and I rode Invertigo for the first time.

1010
01:10:29,882 --> 01:10:31,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know why they call that ride Invertigo?

1011
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:33,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it inverts your stomach by the time you're off of it.

1012
01:10:33,465 --> 01:10:34,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was going to hurl.

1013
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:34,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to go.

1014
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, then I thought I was going to, like, tinkle.

1015
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,041
[SPEAKER_03]: But, my pants.

1016
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:44,266
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got to raid the Demon, like, three times in a row, because there was no lines on Thursday.

1017
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:44,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

1018
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:49,231
[SPEAKER_03]: The Demon is, like, the best ride ever, next to Top Gun, Flight Deck, whatever the fuck ever it's called.

1019
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:52,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other FU would go to the Fires here, which suck.

1020
01:10:53,154 --> 01:10:56,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I can think of for right now, so that's it.

1021
01:10:57,776 --> 01:10:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for the FU's of the week.

1022
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost ran out of music.

1023
01:11:00,101 --> 01:11:01,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost ran out of music.

1024
01:11:01,243 --> 01:11:01,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to cut it short.

1025
01:11:02,386 --> 01:11:05,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have some other music right now we have to get to.

1026
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:12,296
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1027
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:31,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, LLR.

1028
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hi, Sky, because this question is for him.

1029
01:11:33,754 --> 01:11:34,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodie.

1030
01:11:34,514 --> 01:11:37,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, you said that you only have two songs that you like in In the Groove.

1031
01:11:37,775 --> 01:11:38,556
[SPEAKER_00]: What songs are they?

1032
01:11:38,956 --> 01:11:41,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, my favorite song from that game is Do You Love Me.

1033
01:11:41,236 --> 01:11:42,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Osfer.

1034
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:50,439
[SPEAKER_03]: My two favorite songs in In the Groove, actually, there would be three, because I kind of like Lemmings on the Run, and then outside of that, I like the Banzai songs.

1035
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:54,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Zodiac, and I like Anubis.

1036
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:55,141
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1037
01:11:55,181 --> 01:11:56,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Gen Z with that.

1038
01:11:58,186 --> 01:12:00,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not big in the groove music.

1039
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:02,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I like MC Front a lot though.

1040
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it's okay.

1041
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:09,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like the Shusha song because it makes me think of Telemundo.

1042
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:12,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's really it.

1043
01:12:15,495 --> 01:12:16,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Next email.

1044
01:12:16,556 --> 01:12:17,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Dun-dun-dun!

1045
01:12:37,629 --> 01:12:41,131
[SPEAKER_00]: and then addressed to me a classic game of the week and it's from Richard.

1046
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:45,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the 19XX series and I would love to see an updated one.

1047
01:12:45,714 --> 01:12:46,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.

1048
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:47,515
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be so sweet.

1049
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:48,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I crazy?

1050
01:12:48,776 --> 01:12:50,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I saw one was in planning.

1051
01:12:51,838 --> 01:12:52,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1052
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:55,720
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a remake of 1942 coming out to Xbox Live Arcade.

1053
01:12:55,780 --> 01:13:01,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I had heard something about one of the 19 something something games being remade or something was happening.

1054
01:13:01,483 --> 01:13:03,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might get your wish sooner than you thought.

1055
01:13:05,566 --> 01:13:06,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up.

1056
01:13:11,361 --> 01:13:15,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Would a takeover by EA of Take-Two be good for the gaming industry?

1057
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:18,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider 2K Sports and the GTA franchise.

1058
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:18,929
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot is at stake.

1059
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:23,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally prefer a takeover than for EA to spin off Rockstar.

1060
01:13:25,786 --> 01:13:35,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, this, you know, even though I'm not much of a sports game player, I don't think it's a good idea to have 2K Sports and EA, your two biggest sports game makers, in the same roof.

1061
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that's kind of a bad idea.

1062
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:38,351
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd monopolize the market.

1063
01:13:38,471 --> 01:13:39,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1064
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:49,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as the rest of it goes, you know, I don't know enough about the inner workings of the game industry and how, you know, how much freedom the current teams would have to continue to develop their products if this happened.

1065
01:13:49,995 --> 01:14:17,569
[SPEAKER_00]: but that would be my number one concern would be the monopoly of the sports games and that there's really no one else who is wanting to step up and challenge that monopoly of course the fact that EA holds that whole exclusive license thing doesn't help next up and this comes from Ben I cannot believe that you guys didn't jump on this show 284, 6 year anniversary show at 1 hour 7 minutes and 40 second mark Guitar Hero Tool

1066
01:14:18,857 --> 01:14:20,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Comic Freakin' Gold, no one jumped on it.

1067
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:23,300
[SPEAKER_00]: My ears are just burning for one of you to jump on this zinger.

1068
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:25,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Loki that said this to your guest?

1069
01:14:25,822 --> 01:14:28,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, you should all have been all over this one.

1070
01:14:28,444 --> 01:14:30,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh well, peace guys, keep up the great work, and congrats on six years.

1071
01:14:31,206 --> 01:14:32,367
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Andrew that said it.

1072
01:14:32,747 --> 01:14:34,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was someone in chat that had said it.

1073
01:14:35,549 --> 01:14:41,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said Tool would be cool, but... But I think the joke there is that you're kind of a tool if you keep buying all these Guitar Hero games.

1074
01:14:43,175 --> 01:14:44,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, yeah, we missed it.

1075
01:14:44,816 --> 01:14:48,179
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just said that I actually wouldn't mind a Tool edition, because I like Tool.

1076
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:56,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, we did get a couple of different long ones.

1077
01:14:56,536 --> 01:15:00,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this one comes from...

1078
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:05,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's signed Rickchard, so I'm just going to go with that.

1079
01:15:06,617 --> 01:15:07,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Friday, OLR.

1080
01:15:07,757 --> 01:15:08,898
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Friday when I write this.

1081
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:09,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you have a good weekend.

1082
01:15:10,599 --> 01:15:11,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Lord, Smash Bros.

1083
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:12,961
[SPEAKER_00]: is out in the UK.

1084
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Why has it taken so long to come out here?

1085
01:15:15,863 --> 01:15:17,584
[SPEAKER_00]: We always get screwed over with releases.

1086
01:15:17,664 --> 01:15:18,545
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck, Nintendo?

1087
01:15:19,085 --> 01:15:22,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, you need to pull your thumb out of your arse and get some decent games out soon.

1088
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:27,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently completed Metroid on the Wii, and I do believe it was a superb game.

1089
01:15:27,451 --> 01:15:32,334
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I can't help but think that there were some areas that could have been improved so easily.

1090
01:15:33,134 --> 01:15:34,275
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been incredible.

1091
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:37,538
[SPEAKER_00]: The story and writing could have been more immersive and compelling.

1092
01:15:38,078 --> 01:15:43,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's face it, you didn't really care about why you were shooting at those spiky space pirates.

1093
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:46,285
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wanted to get to the next pretty stage with a new and bigger gun.

1094
01:15:47,186 --> 01:15:53,551
[SPEAKER_00]: The cutscenes in this day and age were pretty poor.

1095
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:59,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell me it's because the Wii is underpowered, the PS2 could pull off cinematic and exciting cutscenes for God's sake.

1096
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at Eternal Darkness Retro.

1097
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:03,319
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing.

1098
01:16:03,779 --> 01:16:05,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being in Samus' ship.

1099
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:10,226
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so cool pressing all of those buttons.

1100
01:16:10,947 --> 01:16:14,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, did I miss something or does the best button do nothing at all?

1101
01:16:14,931 --> 01:16:15,892
[SPEAKER_00]: You know which one I mean.

1102
01:16:15,912 --> 01:16:17,413
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that makes the big gun appear.

1103
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:23,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a fantastic bonus to fly off into space and shoot baddies from this fresh perspective.

1104
01:16:23,677 --> 01:16:24,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, bitching over.

1105
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:27,980
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to read this out as I know you hate long emails.

1106
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate long emails.

1107
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:32,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And may have nominated myself for an FU of the week.

1108
01:16:32,783 --> 01:16:35,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, I just realized that I'm making it longer.

1109
01:16:35,184 --> 01:16:36,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, I did it again.

1110
01:16:36,165 --> 01:16:36,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fuck, go balls.

1111
01:16:36,905 --> 01:16:37,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, fuck ours.

1112
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,427
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just trying to get me to say that.

1113
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:41,148
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funny.

1114
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked.

1115
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:43,431
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later.

1116
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:45,672
[SPEAKER_00]: This email brought to you by Chardin is never ending.

1117
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:48,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for some kind of goddamn RTS Command & Conquer game for the Wii.

1118
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:50,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1119
01:16:52,015 --> 01:16:53,216
[SPEAKER_03]: That was... Funny email.

1120
01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:54,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite.

1121
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:55,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up.

1122
01:16:56,138 --> 01:16:56,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Dun-dun-dun.

1123
01:16:58,139 --> 01:16:58,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.

1124
01:16:59,179 --> 01:16:59,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1125
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:00,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

1126
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:03,962
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few questions for the three of you.

1127
01:17:04,622 --> 01:17:04,742
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

1128
01:17:04,963 --> 01:17:05,123
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1129
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:05,123
42.

1130
01:17:05,603 --> 01:17:08,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, go ahead.

1131
01:17:08,645 --> 01:17:09,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear the answer's 42.

1132
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:09,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

1133
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:16,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had what could be termed as holy crap moments as they relate to gaming?

1134
01:17:17,311 --> 01:17:29,118
[SPEAKER_00]: An example may be like when you've seen your first video game or arcade as a youngster, or maybe seen a game that was light years ahead of its contemporaries in some regards.

1135
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:30,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Final Fantasy VII, anyone?

1136
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, how heavily do these holy crap moments factor into your decision to stay with gaming?

1137
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:46,513
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a recent example, play Lost Odyssey, and the first time one of those text-only stories comes up on the screen, the memories, that was kind of one of those, holy crap, type moments.

1138
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:49,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was exactly like the way I said it, too.

1139
01:17:49,134 --> 01:17:49,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

1140
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:52,516
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as, what was the second half of the question?

1141
01:17:52,556 --> 01:17:55,978
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it play into... And your decision to stick with gaming.

1142
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:03,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to say holy crap at movies, but sometimes I like to laugh at movies, sometimes I like to cry at movies.

1143
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:07,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I really cry at video games, but I like to have fun.

1144
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't necessarily have to be a holy crap moment, but they help.

1145
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:22,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that my last holy crap moment... I remember one of my early holy crap moments was when you're doing the train cart ride in Final Fantasy VI.

1146
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:25,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my god, it's like Indiana Jones!

1147
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:26,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a headache!

1148
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:28,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1149
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:32,960
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, every so often I run into a game that gives me those happy moments like that.

1150
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:39,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I keep playing to, you know, find more of those happy times.

1151
01:18:39,205 --> 01:18:40,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought of one other one.

1152
01:18:40,145 --> 01:18:48,031
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Symphony of the Night when you get the real ending, quote unquote, and then you go into the upside down castle and you realize you have to play the whole fucking game all over again.

1153
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:48,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's harder.

1154
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:49,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1155
01:18:49,432 --> 01:18:50,553
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of one of those.

1156
01:18:50,613 --> 01:18:51,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.

1157
01:18:51,473 --> 01:18:53,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how long it took me to freaking get a jewel sword.

1158
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:54,976
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucked.

1159
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:55,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1160
01:18:56,741 --> 01:19:00,143
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'll tell you what took even longer was getting the freaking Yatatsuna.

1161
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:03,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Having to fight the werewolf.

1162
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:04,366
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pain in the butt.

1163
01:19:05,266 --> 01:19:06,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, number two.

1164
01:19:06,547 --> 01:19:10,710
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes back, Rob mentioned that he was interested in the HD remake of Commando 3 for the 360.

1165
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:14,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in his opinion on it, assuming that he's played it.

1166
01:19:15,092 --> 01:19:16,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't, sorry.

1167
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:17,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on my to-do list.

1168
01:19:18,334 --> 01:19:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Naughty me.

1169
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:20,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, number three then.

1170
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:28,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the three of you considered making up some goofy as all hell sounding catchphrases or words to use on air?

1171
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:30,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that using such things can be quite fun.

1172
01:19:30,627 --> 01:19:32,409
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal favorite is snot puppy.

1173
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask, I don't know what it means either.

1174
01:19:34,732 --> 01:19:38,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it up a few years ago after having way too much Crown Royal and Labat Blue.

1175
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I like twat waffle myself, but I didn't make that up, so I can't really claim that I made that up.

1176
01:19:47,475 --> 01:19:48,736
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like twat waffle.

1177
01:19:49,396 --> 01:19:53,939
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what, those types of things, you can't force, like, you can't make fetch happen.

1178
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:55,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop trying to make fetch happen.

1179
01:19:55,601 --> 01:19:57,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Those types of things have to happen naturally.

1180
01:19:58,763 --> 01:19:59,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.

1181
01:19:59,403 --> 01:20:00,084
[SPEAKER_03]: You twat waffle.

1182
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:05,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know of any places where I can buy video game soundtracks, preferably on CD?

1183
01:20:05,945 --> 01:20:11,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of sites where I can get them less than honestly.

1184
01:20:11,509 --> 01:20:13,850
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to support video game music with my hard-earned money.

1185
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Kino Kuniya?

1186
01:20:17,673 --> 01:20:18,654
[SPEAKER_03]: CD Japan?

1187
01:20:18,894 --> 01:20:19,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon.

1188
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:22,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Amazon has a lot of that stuff.

1189
01:20:22,176 --> 01:20:22,877
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got everything.

1190
01:20:24,543 --> 01:20:27,904
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually they're releasing legitimate ones in the US plenty of times now.

1191
01:20:28,164 --> 01:20:36,446
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't prefer shopping online, you like to walk into a store and look at the real thing, try like comic book stores locally because I know one of the ones here has them.

1192
01:20:36,526 --> 01:20:37,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So it depends where this guy lives.

1193
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Try like comic book stores and other nerdy type stores.

1194
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:41,428
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

1195
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:43,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a small selection but they'll probably have it.

1196
01:20:43,608 --> 01:20:48,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the local comic book store here has the Final Fantasies, the DDRs, you know, the big stuff.

1197
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:49,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1198
01:20:51,385 --> 01:20:52,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, last question.

1199
01:20:54,627 --> 01:20:59,149
[SPEAKER_00]: On a similar note, once I move, I'll be considering buying one to two, three arcade machines.

1200
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:02,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never bought any before in my life.

1201
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:05,331
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, what advice as pointers can you give me?

1202
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:12,335
[SPEAKER_00]: If it helps at all, all the games I'll consider were made between 1978 and 1998 and span across virtually every genre.

1203
01:21:12,435 --> 01:21:17,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you probably the best thing you're going to be able to do for your money is to get an EOGO AVS machine.

1204
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1205
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:40,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a while you see those Ultra Kade-ish things pop up.

1206
01:21:40,637 --> 01:21:45,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Target was running one like two Christmases ago and I think Costco once in a while has one too.

1207
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to really keep your eye out for them.

1208
01:21:47,599 --> 01:21:52,741
[SPEAKER_03]: They usually show up around the holidays but another multi-game in one system and very, very classic stuff.

1209
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,402
[SPEAKER_00]: We built a MAME cabinet out of a pole position stand-up.

1210
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:55,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1211
01:21:56,462 --> 01:21:57,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could do that too.

1212
01:21:58,343 --> 01:21:59,063
[SPEAKER_00]: MAME is fun.

1213
01:22:00,223 --> 01:22:04,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the somewhat lengthy email and thank you for taking the time to read it as well as answer my questions.

1214
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:05,405
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1215
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:06,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be a dollar.

1216
01:22:06,573 --> 01:22:07,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Last email.

1217
01:22:07,854 --> 01:22:08,115
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1218
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:09,116
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the long one.

1219
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

1220
01:22:10,397 --> 01:22:11,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was the long one.

1221
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:11,759
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1222
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:12,379
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1223
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:13,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one.

1224
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and good show to everyone.

1225
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:17,445
[SPEAKER_00]: This is... It's Rini, right?

1226
01:22:22,346 --> 01:22:23,927
[SPEAKER_00]: A very long time since I've written in.

1227
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:29,032
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin, I'd like to touch on Knuckles Chaotix as featured on DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week from a couple episodes ago.

1228
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:33,197
[SPEAKER_00]: A correction, the characters were not rendered in 3D, they were sprite-based.

1229
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:35,399
[SPEAKER_00]: What was in 3D were the special stages.

1230
01:22:35,859 --> 01:22:36,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, they looked rendered.

1231
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:43,886
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting note on said special stages, you can complete them all to get an obligatory set of jewels that need to be acquired.

1232
01:22:44,267 --> 01:22:50,852
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as an extra challenge, players could compete in special stages again, only this time the stages were drawn in wireframes.

1233
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:59,580
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it even more devious, the wireframe versions, you only had flickering verticals of the polygons to go by to avoid the holes as best as possible.

1234
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,221
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura also touched on Sonic Crackers, the presumed prototype for Chaotix.

1235
01:23:04,701 --> 01:23:14,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily a tip, but for anyone who's played the old side-scrolling Sonic games, should go online and read up on the analyses for earlier ROM dumps that were meant for developers' eyes.

1236
01:23:15,264 --> 01:23:20,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting bits include tiny nuances such as the pixel-perfect placement of the score, ring...

1237
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:31,469
[SPEAKER_00]: and Life Indicators on screen to the creepy sounding Genocide City Zone, an alternative stage that was supposed to be a meltdown version of the Chemical Plant Zone in Sonic 2 that players would reach later in the game.

1238
01:23:31,669 --> 01:23:33,129
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice way to kill an afternoon.

1239
01:23:33,329 --> 01:23:34,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I love prototypes, though.

1240
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I love looking for prototype games.

1241
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:44,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a couple of prototypes that were released for Atari 5200, like Millipede.

1242
01:23:45,213 --> 01:23:45,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

1243
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:46,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is hot.

1244
01:23:47,014 --> 01:23:47,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ms.

1245
01:23:47,274 --> 01:23:47,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Pac-Man.

1246
01:23:49,073 --> 01:23:51,814
[SPEAKER_00]: For the other half of this email, it's not quite half, it's more like a third.

1247
01:23:52,674 --> 01:24:00,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to your anniversary shows, Ask Orange Knowledge, Radio Segment, and Bobby Blackwolf asked how Konami could improve the American Bimani situation.

1248
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:05,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Very briefly, was poppin' music mentioned as to how it could be brought over, which it should.

1249
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:10,321
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the obvious issue of localizing it, but there's another problem, content.

1250
01:24:10,742 --> 01:24:13,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but poppin' has a lot of songs unfit for the U.S.

1251
01:24:14,063 --> 01:24:15,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I was mulling over this for a while and thought of a different...

1252
01:24:16,764 --> 01:24:16,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.

1253
01:24:16,924 --> 01:24:17,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely agree.

1254
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,905
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to just copy the same damn game.

1255
01:24:18,925 --> 01:24:19,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.

1256
01:24:34,531 --> 01:24:38,217
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want my take on this, Konami should have a video game themed song list.

1257
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:45,567
[SPEAKER_00]: In optimal situation, the US song list would consist of part KOs, part licenses, and part songs from video games.

1258
01:24:45,668 --> 01:24:47,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just Konami either, here's why.

1259
01:24:47,831 --> 01:24:48,932
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal preference...

1260
01:24:50,254 --> 01:24:52,555
[SPEAKER_00]: We should get a poppin' Wii and take Smash Bros.

1261
01:24:52,595 --> 01:24:55,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Brawl approach, because the Wii is selling downloads, etc.

1262
01:24:57,557 --> 01:25:12,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine Konami being able not only to access music from every Nintendo console release, but also from any console services on the Virtual Console, aka anything before PS1 in any sort of relevance, although technically you can have access to an entirety of Sega's offerings, too.

1263
01:25:13,564 --> 01:25:20,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine playing the goddamn hardcore remix of Gourmet Race from Kirby Superstars that's on Brawl on Poppin'.

1264
01:25:22,146 --> 01:25:24,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, holy shit, shut up, sexy ferret, OMG.

1265
01:25:26,307 --> 01:25:35,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, imagine Konami having access to those vast assets and putting select songs into Poppin' earlier in their original chiptune form or gloriously remixed from Modernization.

1266
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:38,290
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an Anamelo version, though.

1267
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:39,261
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1268
01:26:06,507 --> 01:26:10,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero, Rock Music, DDR, Dance Music

1269
01:26:22,998 --> 01:26:24,180
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1270
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:39,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the last third of the email.

1271
01:26:53,789 --> 01:26:57,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and it'd be a double as filler for Japanese releases, but no one cares for that.

1272
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,631
[SPEAKER_00]: This email has run too long, so I'd like to give a chance for another listener to give their input.

1273
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:09,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I finish, however, I'd like to chastise the OLR host, Minkletov, and the Andrew Junami, the Zephyr, is that how it's pronounced?

1274
01:27:09,693 --> 01:27:10,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Zephyr.

1275
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:14,134
[SPEAKER_00]: For the listless selections for the best Mimani songs on the 6th anniversary show.

1276
01:27:14,514 --> 01:27:16,775
[SPEAKER_00]: How could you neglect Scorpion Fire from 2DX Red?

1277
01:27:17,395 --> 01:27:20,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking about the epic 8-minute long version 1-2.

1278
01:27:20,095 --> 01:27:20,236
[SPEAKER_00]: You're...

1279
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:25,080
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all mean, but points to Loki for canceling out Zephyr.

1280
01:27:25,781 --> 01:27:33,325
[SPEAKER_00]: This message was brought to you by the Metallic Rose DS Lite, because baiting and switching target for your coral pink light for Metallic Rose just feels right.

1281
01:27:33,785 --> 01:27:34,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I really did do this.

1282
01:27:34,926 --> 01:27:36,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on you, but that's funny.

1283
01:27:36,847 --> 01:27:40,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That was an epic email.

1284
01:27:40,249 --> 01:27:41,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic email is very epic.

1285
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,651
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get back to the news.

1286
01:27:43,751 --> 01:27:44,191
[SPEAKER_03]: We still got Tommy.

1287
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:44,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

1288
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:44,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to it.

1289
01:27:50,585 --> 01:27:55,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some interesting patents filed by Sony here.

1290
01:27:55,946 --> 01:28:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, people are speculating it's for the next PSP or whatever system they're going to be calling it.

1291
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:12,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the patent was granted for a handheld device with touchscreen and digital tactile pixels.

1292
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting.

1293
01:28:17,614 --> 01:28:21,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea what they claim digital tactile pixels are.

1294
01:28:22,056 --> 01:28:32,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, as for digital tactile pixels, claims 19 through 30 of the patent suggests that vibration acts as a tactile response.

1295
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:35,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, a PSP with a touch screen?

1296
01:28:36,562 --> 01:28:38,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like you would touch it and it would vibrate or something.

1297
01:28:39,323 --> 01:28:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1298
01:28:39,763 --> 01:28:40,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Tickling game.

1299
01:28:42,264 --> 01:28:43,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it might be fun.

1300
01:28:43,505 --> 01:28:44,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1301
01:28:46,448 --> 01:28:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: well who knows what that's going to be but something's in the works which is not surprising very interesting um

1302
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:01,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, and I apologize because this link here on our roll is broken.

1303
01:29:02,198 --> 01:29:04,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, maybe Loki can help me out a little bit here.

1304
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 3 apparently was rumored to be in the next Nintendo Power.

1305
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:08,220
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up with that?

1306
01:29:09,461 --> 01:29:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we already kind of talked about that, actually.

1307
01:29:12,002 --> 01:29:12,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 3?

1308
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:17,604
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we only talked about some of the other stuff in the Nintendo Power League, but apparently they're saying something about Kingdom Hearts 3?

1309
01:29:18,044 --> 01:29:19,484
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was a thing that was rumored.

1310
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:23,606
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a sword in the new... I remember Jamie talked about it, actually.

1311
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:24,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

1312
01:29:24,126 --> 01:29:24,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1313
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:25,871
[SPEAKER_02]: KingHeart3

1314
01:29:48,715 --> 01:29:49,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I get it.

1315
01:29:50,697 --> 01:29:53,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see, because that happens in the comments to this little news story here.

1316
01:29:53,859 --> 01:29:55,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, who knows?

1317
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:01,584
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think... They've already got two Kingdom Hearts games in the pipeline that aren't even out yet, so you're full of crap.

1318
01:30:02,245 --> 01:30:02,545
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1319
01:30:04,206 --> 01:30:04,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm full of crap?

1320
01:30:04,886 --> 01:30:05,347
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not you.

1321
01:30:05,727 --> 01:30:10,970
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who are trying to say Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out on the Wii.

1322
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally doubt that.

1323
01:30:12,932 --> 01:30:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see you next month.

1324
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:14,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's true.

1325
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:25,979
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some news regarding Crave and the ESA, as in Crave said bye to the ESA, which is the Entertainment Software Association.

1326
01:30:27,139 --> 01:30:40,867
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sent a report into... They actually confirmed, sorry, a report on Game Politics that Crave Entertainment was basically splitting, that they decided not to renew their membership, and they're off to, I guess...

1327
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:42,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Do their own thing.

1328
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:46,832
[SPEAKER_00]: The other departures that left were the Vendy Activision, LucasArts.

1329
01:30:49,634 --> 01:30:51,676
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of those other things you were talking about previously.

1330
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting that one more has now joined them.

1331
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:57,001
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, I try to think, what has Crave done lately?

1332
01:30:58,442 --> 01:30:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing I can think of.

1333
01:30:59,844 --> 01:31:01,025
[SPEAKER_00]: World Championship Poker.

1334
01:31:01,745 --> 01:31:02,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee.

1335
01:31:02,706 --> 01:31:02,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1336
01:31:02,886 --> 01:31:03,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1337
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:12,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess this isn't exactly, it's not nearly as big as Activision Vivendi not going, but it is interesting that the exodus continues nonetheless.

1338
01:31:12,714 --> 01:31:12,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1339
01:31:15,723 --> 01:31:21,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that's been gone for a while that's actually just come back is Nestor.

1340
01:31:22,148 --> 01:31:24,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Nestor from Nintendo Power.

1341
01:31:25,111 --> 01:31:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Nestor and Howard.

1342
01:31:28,073 --> 01:31:28,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1343
01:31:28,494 --> 01:31:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Howard and Nestor, I guess.

1344
01:31:30,155 --> 01:31:33,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And their exploits and, you know, chronicled in Nintendo Power.

1345
01:31:33,498 --> 01:31:40,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, after a, you know, hiatus of quite a long time, he's back and grown up.

1346
01:31:41,644 --> 01:31:43,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because now he's...

1347
01:31:45,526 --> 01:31:45,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1348
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:48,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Losing at Mario Kart apparently from the picture.

1349
01:31:50,489 --> 01:31:51,049
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1350
01:32:21,557 --> 01:32:28,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I told everyone I'm going to give everybody a hard time because they kept ragging on me for Saturn games and for Sega love.

1351
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked a Sega Saturn game.

1352
01:32:31,202 --> 01:32:31,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1353
01:32:32,362 --> 01:32:35,504
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked Astal, which is known as... Oh, awesome.

1354
01:32:35,564 --> 01:32:36,405
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's known as?

1355
01:32:38,446 --> 01:32:39,406
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awesome, I know.

1356
01:32:40,106 --> 01:32:44,849
[SPEAKER_00]: It's... Kisui Shodensetsu Astaru.

1357
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is the fucking shit, is what it is.

1358
01:32:49,825 --> 01:32:53,101
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 2D side-scroller, and listen to this music, isn't it pretty?

1359
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:07,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those gorgeous 2D games that came out fairly early in the Saturn's life.

1360
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:17,494
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is just a beautiful game that really shows just the amazing 2D capabilities that the Saturn had.

1361
01:33:17,755 --> 01:33:21,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the PlayStation would not have been able to make this game look this gorgeous.

1362
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:22,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1363
01:33:22,617 --> 01:33:25,059
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the 2D capability of...

1364
01:33:26,886 --> 01:33:27,607
[SPEAKER_00]: A Snotty Nose

1365
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:53,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as you go through the game, you actually get a little partner that goes with you called Lita.

1366
01:33:54,523 --> 01:33:57,906
[SPEAKER_00]: That you'd be able to...

1367
01:33:59,907 --> 01:34:00,207
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

1368
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:27,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you could also, um, you know, punch things and jump things and you could, you know, stun your enemies by punching them and you can throw objects and lift humongous things.

1369
01:34:28,303 --> 01:34:35,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also had this sort of super breath attack that you would inhale and then just blow it all out and blow all the enemies away.

1370
01:34:36,387 --> 01:34:40,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a really, really, really cool game.

1371
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you have it.

1372
01:34:45,061 --> 01:34:53,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just to mention, if anyone read the Sonic the Hedgehog comic books that Archie Comics did, Astall shows up a whole bunch in the background.

1373
01:34:54,393 --> 01:35:00,240
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can find a YouTube of there's a volcano level, it's fucking awesome.

1374
01:35:01,021 --> 01:35:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Best music in the game, I think.

1375
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:05,967
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first level of the game.

1376
01:35:22,128 --> 01:35:26,589
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually another couple of neat trivia things about it.

1377
01:35:26,649 --> 01:35:27,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, go ahead.

1378
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:33,332
[SPEAKER_00]: The US release of the game has it where the title does not appear on the side of the case.

1379
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:35,712
[SPEAKER_00]: All you get is the Sega Saturn logo.

1380
01:35:37,133 --> 01:35:46,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has music hidden in the game, which is basically the music from the intro, where you can just put it in a CD player and listen to it.

1381
01:35:47,416 --> 01:35:49,457
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lyrics in the Japanese version.

1382
01:35:49,517 --> 01:35:49,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just...

1383
01:35:50,817 --> 01:35:51,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Instrumental in the US one.

1384
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:55,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also in the game's graphic files is a sprite of Mario.

1385
01:35:59,884 --> 01:36:01,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's your trivia.

1386
01:36:01,825 --> 01:36:02,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

1387
01:36:02,926 --> 01:36:04,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out on the Sega Saturn.

1388
01:36:04,707 --> 01:36:07,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a pretty easy game to find or kind of hard at this point?

1389
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:11,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard at this point, but if you can find it, definitely go for it.

1390
01:36:12,252 --> 01:36:14,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are images of it available.

1391
01:36:15,017 --> 01:36:16,538
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're finally going to take a break here.

1392
01:36:16,578 --> 01:36:18,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pretty long this segment here, over an hour and a half.

1393
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:20,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take a break here.

1394
01:36:21,003 --> 01:36:22,664
[SPEAKER_03]: When we come back, more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1395
01:36:22,704 --> 01:36:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot in our next segment news-wise because we're going to have a nice long interview with Tommy Tallarico.

1396
01:36:27,428 --> 01:36:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be here to talk about Video Games Live, the gang audio network guild that's going to be pretty cool.

1397
01:36:34,595 --> 01:36:37,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1398
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:38,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned.
