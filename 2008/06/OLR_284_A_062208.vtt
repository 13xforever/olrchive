00:07.000 --> 00:12.000

00:13.000 --> 00:26.000
Tonight, June 22, 2008, the PSP gets new 4.0 firmware, the ESRB makes plans to stop early game announcements, and we celebrate six years of Orange Lounge Radio being on the air

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
Hello everybody out there once again and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio for the 284th time in a row if you've been a long time listener

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you for the next three hours to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hi

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
How are you?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm here

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Nah, it's all good

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, it's all good?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
It's all good at Camp Jamie

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm recovering from my milkshake

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Did your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
It brought something

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Alright

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
It brought gas

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Say hello to as well TechMaster

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
You're so gross

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Say hello as well to TechMaster Loki

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
How would a milkshake bring you gas?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't know, it's just the first thing my toilet brain went to

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Alright, I too finished the milkshake

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Did you?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I went and got my, cause I went and stopped by Burger King and I got a large milkshake and a large soda

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And what did it bring you?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Uh, cooling

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Cooling?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Alright

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, cause I'm not so hot anymore

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Alright, sounds good

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Are you seriously freaking cold?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I mean

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
I just, I need like something to cover up while I'm under all of this

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Let me introduce, since Loki's already yelling at somebody, he has not been on our show in quite some time

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
About a year

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
But he's, well a year is quite some time

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I was just quantifying it

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Alright

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But Miklotov is here tonight

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
And Miklotov ran away from our program to go be in Kansas for a little while, right?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Alright

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
And he walked into the studio tonight wearing a blanket

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Cause it feels cozy after you eat a lot of food, it's like oh I'm just gonna relax

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I would like to point out it's over a hundred degrees outside here in lovely Sacramento, California

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
It feels, this is like a nice blanket, it's not heavy so it feels fine

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
But I'm just saying it's like a, it's a hundred degrees outside

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Hold on

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And we had to have the lights off before the show to keep it cool in here

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
We have like two fans going, the door open to the house

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, we might return the lights off, screw Justin TV, it's not a, it's not a video show

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
And

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
And I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a shirt underneath

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
And shorts

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
And now a blanket

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
And a blanket

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
And why, just because

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Because it feels nice

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Because it's, yeah if you eat a lot of food and then you're like oh I'm so stuffed and

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
you don't want to move

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It always feels better to just have something that you kind of wrap yourself up in

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Like you were the food and this is your shell, like a tostada or something

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Okay, uh, tell us what you've been up to for the past year, anything exciting?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Hmm, no

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Okay

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I almost got hit by a tornado

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
That's, I think that's kind of cool

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
That's what happens in Kansas, huh?

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, it interrupted wow and it wasn't very fun because I had to stop playing wow for

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
a minute

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Gotcha

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
And go check on the tornado

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Are you still in touch, you used to work at the Konami building but then they don't have

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
their offices here in NorCal

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I don't know what you can or can't say about the past or the future

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Oh, I'm working for them as an independent contractor

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Ah, very cool

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Can you talk about anything, probably not, huh?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Stuff

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
No, it's whatever I always do

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Alright

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
You doing stuff?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
As arrows

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Alright

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Hey, those lights went off

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Alright, let's change the topic and talk about our gaming weeks

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
We always like to start the show off talking about what we've been playing in our weeks

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
and we'll start it off ladies first, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Um, I played Ragnarok and Pinball, as usual

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm still waiting for Dan to bring me back, the world ends with you

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
so I have no idea what's going on

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
That's it

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Alrighty, Loki

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Um, I got an R4 this week so I was playing some DS games

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
and I tried playing, um, what was it, uh, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
but that game is boring, absolutely boring since it's all in Japanese and I can't read any of it

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm like, seriously, when am I gonna get to the boob poking, okay?

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
But, uh, yeah, just, it's, uh, One Trick Pony it seems like

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
Um, and then, uh, I tried a bit of, um, Band Brothers

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
which is actually pretty, pretty neat

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Um, a little difficult to figure out how to play it though

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
but, um, still a pretty cool music game, it'd be nice to see that brought over here

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Um, then also played, um, Jump Ultra Superstars

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
which, um, I guess people compare it to Smash Brothers a little bit

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I wouldn't say it's quite like Smash Brothers

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
There's a lot of characters in it for sure and I like how you can, um,

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
kind of combine different pieces of artwork and stuff to, you know, allow you to switch characters

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
and add abilities and stuff like that

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
So I'd say it's more like Marvel vs. Capcom or something like that

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
which is pretty cool

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And then, um, played a little bit of that Still Live game

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, it's pretty much very similar to the, uh, Flash Portal games

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
so if you've played that you, you know, pretty much have played this game as well

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And, um, Point Blank DS because I was trying to find that everywhere

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
and no one sold it and just kind of gave up on it

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
I mean, Point Blank DS is pretty much, you know, just like Point Blank without a gun

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and just using the stylus and actually pretty fun

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So, uh, too bad that that didn't do very well

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
And then of course on top of all that stuff I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Because that's fun

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
So, what does this device do, this R4, for those that don't know?

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
It allows you to run homebrew on your DS and also you can, you know, run ROMs as well

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
for DS games

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Basically it uses a micro SD card and you can throw stuff on there

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
It's good for, like, playing import stuff, you know, especially if you're just looking to try out a game

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
and don't actually plan on buying it

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
What the hell is this?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Aw, I was waiting for the singing to start

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Yo ho yo ho, a pirate's life for me, bad joke

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You need to queue up your jokes next time

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Terrible, I know

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Aw, that one would have been better

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm glad to know after six years things still don't work right on this program

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Awesome

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And then other, well, I was working on some other things

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
I posted a video on Game Trail, because I mean the post-it on the YouTube community we have

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
But I forgot how to, so

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, it was like the easiest thing in the world

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
It is the easiest thing in the world, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, okay

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
So tell us a little bit, because this is kind of exciting

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Because Orange Launch Radio hasn't done anything video related

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I mean, we don't really count just in TV

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I mean, no offense to just the TV people

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
But this is just a camera pointed at people doing a radio show

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
It's really not that exciting, but you wanted it, so hey

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
But this is the first real video thing we've done in a long time

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So tell us a little more about what you did

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I actually finally got my video set up working at home

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Because I've been trying forever to get my damn capture card to work

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
And be able to play something at the same time

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It actually involved me bringing back the old TV that was in the arcade cabinet

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Back from work, and putting it on the floor next to my computer

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And actually running it from the game system to the TV

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And then the TV to the capture card

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And it actually works perfect that way

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So I captured a bunch of footage

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I've been playing around with this glitch in Grand Theft Auto 4

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
With an evil swing set

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
And I put it all to the music of Weapon of Choice

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Edited it together, and it's kind of funny

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And I know when he describes it, it doesn't sound that exciting

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
But I actually watched a video, and I'm not even that big a Grand Theft Auto person

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
I know it's a good game and all, but I just don't get into those types of games as much as everyone else

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
I kind of laughed, it was really funny, it was well done

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It fit the music so well

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
I tried, I spent long hours trying to get it to go with the music

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Making video is a bitch

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
I've done video for an online game that Shane and I are involved with

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And it's a pain in the ass

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
It took me all night to do a two and a half minute video

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, it's a three minute video, and I started with like four hours of video

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And I cut it down to three minutes

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I bet the wife loves it

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh yeah, she loves the fact that I'm sitting there doing all that stuff

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, absolutely loves it

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
No, and then after I finished that, then I started working on something else

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Which I was hoping to have done today, but it's not

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So you'll have to wait

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Can you give us any hints?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Maybe

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'll say something

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Something that people have been asking for for a long, long time

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Loki is making happen

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
We'll say that

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Alright

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So so much for your gaming week, is that it?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Why is the Unabomber at our window?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It looks like it's Andrew, not the Unabomber

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I know it's Andrew

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
I'll go next, I didn't even know he was coming

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I'll go next and talk about my gaming week

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh my god, it's the Unabomber

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Hi, how are you?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Get him on a mic somehow

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Oh, the fourth mic's not hooked up now

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I didn't know you were coming, that's alright

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I wouldn't miss it for the world

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, this is the kind of gems that Justin-

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
See, Justin TV? He does kind of look like the Unabomber

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Alright

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What's on your mind?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Andrew, welcome to the show tonight

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Oh, not much

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
You gotta get that mic like right there

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's now working right

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It's a crazy mic

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
You're here to celebrate our sixth birthday with us, I'm sure

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Of course

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And your own anniversary is tomorrow, as in your birthday

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
How old are you going to be tomorrow?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Appropriately, I'm going to be 23

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Wow, ah, oh my gosh, there's that number of coincidence again

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
That got brought up on Bobby's show earlier

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oops

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Wow

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
That means you were 17 when this show started?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yes, I was

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
God, I'm old

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
God, I am old, alright

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Let's talk about My Gaming Week

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
We'll get back to Andrew later, you can talk about his

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
My Gaming Week, I played Warcraft because I'm addicted

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
And some other stuff too

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I got into very randomly

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Like, got back into playing Guitar Hero 3

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
I don't even remember why, but I just started, like, hacking at it again

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
And some of those songs that were really holding me back

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Like, Knights of Sedonia was a song on hard

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I was having a hard time beating

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, I'm still on the hard difficulty, I can't play expert yet

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Because there's these triplets in hard mode that are so difficult in that song

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I had the hardest time getting past it, but finally I beat it this week

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
And then I started playing some other songs too

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And I even downloaded the Coldplay pack and the No Doubt pack

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because, I don't know, for some reason

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I enjoy playing Guitar Hero more than I enjoy playing Rock Band

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Which I know is weird

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Because you would think, like, Rock Band's kind of the better game

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And in a lot of ways it is

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But since I don't really like to play drums

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And I'm not going to sing in my house

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Like, especially when nobody's around

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's kind of like a party where I can use alcohol as an excuse

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
It's, I don't know, there's nothing to play but guitar

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And I kind of like the guitar parts in Guitar Hero

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Better than I do Rock Band

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Rock Band gets kind of boring

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Because, I don't know, it's a little closer to the real thing or something

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I don't know

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
But Guitar Hero gets all crazy and I like that

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
So, Rapid Slasher and Chat Room

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com agrees

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
That section on Sedonia is tough

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
It is tough

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
There it is

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Cheeseburger in Chat says

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Hey Rob, I was 7 when the show started

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Because he's 13 now, my god

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I'm old

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I thought he was listening to the show at 7

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't think he was actually listening when he was 7

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I think he just said he was

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Happened to be 7

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Joshie16 in Chat says

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Guitar Hero is more fun alone

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, I kind of agree

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Guitar Hero may not be the better party game

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
But it's more fun to play by yourself

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So, go figure

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Alright, also in my gaming week

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I bought Space Invaders Extreme for the PSP

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Because I had played a little bit

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
When Loki had it over here

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know, whatever

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
He had it on his PSP a while ago

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
And I played it and I kind of liked it

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I was like, hey, it's like Space Invaders mixed with Rez

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
And it was kind of cool

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
So I decided I was going to get it

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Although, I don't know, it's not really like mixed with Rez

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
It just has that same like, upbeat music

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And it kind of feels like a game that would have been made by Q Entertainment

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
But it's not

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
My only kind of complaint about the game

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I mean, they made Space Invaders a heck of a lot of fun

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I mean, not only do you have

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
You know Space Invaders

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Who doesn't know that game by now

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
But now

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Like, not only is it flashy with the graphics in the background

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But the invaders come in little colors

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
And you have some red ones

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Some green ones

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
And some blue ones

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
And if you shoot four blue ones in a row

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
You get one type of weapon

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You shoot red ones in a row

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You get another

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
And so on

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
So that's kind of like a challenge-y element to it

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
If you want the good weapon

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So it's like a cross between Space Invaders

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
And Raven

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, I guess, yeah

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
It's kind of different

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
But the only thing that kind of disappointed me

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Now granted, I haven't played the game a whole lot

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Or gotten very far

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So it's probably not fair for me to say a whole lot about it right now

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
But, I mean, I've played far enough where I've started to notice this

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I don't notice a lot really change from level to level

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I mean, yeah, the aliens get smarter

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You start to fight these, like, massive aliens

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And one of the coolest things, I think, in the game is the bosses

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Like, they actually have boss aliens they have to fight

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Which is kind of cool

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And, you know, then you have the little miniature aliens

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
But it's still always blue, red, green aliens

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
And the same weapon upgrades that you had in level one

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
So I was just kind of hoping maybe some of that would change and upgrade as the game goes on

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
If it does, I haven't gotten there yet

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And I've gotten to the point where it's starting to feel a little stale

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
So, you know

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
You know, because the original Space Invaders was all white or green aliens

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
It's been 30 fucking years since the original Space Invaders

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
It ain't broke

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, but would you spend $20 to buy the original Space Invaders

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Which I think most of us now play as, you know

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, we downloaded the ROM in two seconds to play on MAME

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And we fire it up one time and go

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Oh, yeah, this game, oh, this is fun

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Ah, next game

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Pretty much

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
How many people actually sit there and play old school Space Invaders for, like, three hours

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Like they did back in the 80s

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Um

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Really?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Really?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
When?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
About two years ago

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Wow

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Why?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Were you trying to, like, break it?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
You know, okay

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I take a little bit of it back because

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
I've even found myself on GameTap going back to old Atari 2600 games

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
That were boring years ago, like Kaboom

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
And I frickin' played Kaboom for, like, an hour and a half

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Just a couple weeks ago

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
So I could, I guess I could see that

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I was trying to break my old record, though

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
But let's face it

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
We used to be really, really good at Space Invaders

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Let's face it, we're a little weird

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
You should watch King Kong, watch the guy play Crystal Castles with his feet

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I guess that's true

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Do you have any interest, then I want to ask you

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Do you have any interest in newer Space Invaders?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Or is it like, oh no, this is bastardizing a classic?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I would try it

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Alright

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I mean, I'm open to anything

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
The new Frogger made me want to throw up

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
But I'll give Space Invaders a try

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
The one on Xbox Live?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
No

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
That Frogger 2?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Oh

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
No, no, the old new Frogger

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
The old new Frogger

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, okay

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Wanna be 3D Frogger?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
It made me want to throw up

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I downloaded Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, by the way

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
The, um

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
The, uh, revamped version

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Um

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I don't think it was based on PlayStation 2

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I think it's original

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Or a PlayStation game

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I think it's an original game

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Um

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
It's

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
There was a Frogger 2, though

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
It's so cute

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
You want to throw up in your mouth

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
But the little hoppy noise gets really irritating

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
But I only played the demo

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
I didn't actually buy the full game

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
So

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Anyway, that's pretty much it for my gaming week

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Space Invaders

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Which is pretty cool

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
I mean, for 20 bucks

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
It's pretty hard to beat

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
It's a good priced game

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
And, uh

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
It's a

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
You know, PSP games are not games you'd usually

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I mean, unless you're playing Crisis Core or something

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Not something you spend hours and hours and hours doing

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I prefer playing the PSP

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
While I'm waiting at the airport for my plane

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Or while I'm waiting for something, you know, better to happen in my real life

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
So Space Invaders is a good short attention span game

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I tried playing Crisis Core

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
That game bores me

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Really?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
With all the praise and things it's gotten?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
It's boring

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I don't know

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I tried playing it twice

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Now, I've

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
I played it for a good long

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
You know, two hour session

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Was it, uh, a while ago

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
When it first came out

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
And then I played it

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Some more

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Like the end of April

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
During the plane flight

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
And

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I just couldn't get into it

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
It was so boring

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
It's just because I think you

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Kind of start off at that, like, hub there

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
And you have little places that you can explore

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
But it doesn't really feel like an actual fancy game

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
It just feels like

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Do mission

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Fight people

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Go back to the hub

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Do mission

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Fight people

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Go back

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't know

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It's just very boring for me

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Okay, I gotta go to chatroom

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Because they're talking about

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
A lot about Space Invaders here

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Um, GS68 says from Wikipedia

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Space Invaders was a very popular video game

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
That influenced the video game industry

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
In Japan, specialty arcades opened with

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Nothing but Space Invaders cabinets

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
The game is considered one of the most

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Successful arcade shooting games

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Uh, you know, so

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
We all know that

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
People went crazy about the game in Japan

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
We know that

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Um, it was much bigger over there

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Than it was over here

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
And the Kitsune in chat says

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You see Space Invaders everywhere here

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
They even have Space Invaders plushies in the arcade

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
That you can win

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
That might be kind of cute actually

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I had Space Invader

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Um, cell phone charm

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
For a while

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Now the original Space Invaders

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Can be kind of boring

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Continues Kitsune in our chatroom

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
But I played a newer version

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I loved it

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And yeah, I, I, I enjoyed

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Space Invaders Extreme

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Which is a tiny bit stale

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
But that's okay, it's a good

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Short attention span game

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Kind of like the Gradius collection

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I don't sit there and play Gradius

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
For hours and hours either

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Shooters in general

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
No comment

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Huh?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
No comment

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Shooters in general to me

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Are short attention span games

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
That's just the way I play

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
I would like a new Gradius game

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
That was actually really kickass

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
You know, cause I mean

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Gradius 5 was alright

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
It was pretty cool

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But something really like

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Oomph, like awesome

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
You need a, somehow like

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
The universe needs to collide

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
A certain way

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
And Itagaki needs to do

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Gradius 6, right?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
There wouldn't be a ship

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
It'd just be him there

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Just like

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Kicking people over and stuff

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Alright

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Putting out cigarettes

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
On like other ships or something

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Let me go over to Miklotov

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Who's reading a book

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
During our show

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I guess we're that exciting

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Miklotov, do you have anything

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
You want to say about

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Your gaming week

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Not our gaming week

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
But yours

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
My book is good

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't know what you're talking about

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
First of all

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Secondly, all I do is play WoW

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Or I play DJ Max on my PSP

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
So

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
You need to play DS games

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I have a DS with a bunch of games on it

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Including imports

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
You will play

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I play Oh And On 2

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
And Phoenix Wright games

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
And that's about it

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
And Professor Layton

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Well I have Oh And On 2 on here

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I have that with me

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
But it's not my book

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
And Band Brothers

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I have Band Brothers

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Band Brothers is a fun game

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Tell our listeners about DJ Max

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
And some of the things you enjoy about it

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
It's better than Beatmania

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
We have some listeners that really love it

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's way better than Beatmania

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Why

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Because it's fun

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And it's not insanely stupid sometimes

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Unlike Beatmania

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Which is insanely stupid most of the time

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
And it's easy to pick up and go

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And the songs are better

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And it's Korean

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
So it's better because of that

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
So in other words

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
If you can't sense

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Mikolatov's insane bias

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
For Korean based music

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
And Korean things

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Because he likes Pump It Up a lot too

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah Pump It Up is better than DDR

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah see if you can't sense his extreme bias

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
For all things Korean

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Then take what he says with the Korean stuff

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
How about Tycho No Tatrogen DS

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I've not played that

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It didn't look good

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't like the one in the arcade

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And I didn't like the one on the Playstation

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
So I don't think I like the one on the DS

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
But yeah DJ Max is cool

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Because you can customize like

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Everything in it

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
And it's fun

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
It's got stupid videos

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah I like the one video with the Power Rangers

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Smashing the girls' flowers

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
The MB Rangers are cool

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Is that what it was called?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
The MB Rangers?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Funny

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
That's it

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Back to book

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I like Burning Rangers

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Andrew how was your gaming week?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Well I could talk about other games

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
That are good for 20 bucks

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Like Hellgate London

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Which looks like it's finally out of beta

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
What six months after release

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
They're working on a 2.0 patch

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
It's an okay Diablo 2 clone

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
But it could be better

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
It could be way way better

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Other than that I've been enjoying the free weekend

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Of Team Fortress 2

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
And getting in a little day of defeat

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Not much else really

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Recently got Brawl and unlocked everything

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Within nine hours of opening the box

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Wow that's dedication

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Still haven't got all the achievements though

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Still a lot of stuff to do

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
People need to register me

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
For Brawl by the way

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It's getting a lot of-

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Do you know your friend code off the top of your head?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Off the top of my head? No

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Thank you Nintendo

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm not that dedicated

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Just go to the forums

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm there

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Look at it

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Nice plug

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Click on the forums

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Thank you

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Anything else you've been playing this week?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh that's about it

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Besides Brawl and Hellgate

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Nothing else

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
DJ Ratchet in chat says

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
And again if you want to join our chat room

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
He says

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
I hope there will eventually be an Elite Beat Agents 2

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
As much as it pains me to say at fat chance

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And Miklotov's agreeing

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Why are you agreeing Miklotov?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Cause like

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I think

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Four people bought it?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I bought it, you bought it

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Who else bought Elite Beat Agents?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
That's it, no

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
That's two, there's half

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Okay, Andrew bought

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
There's the four right there

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Obviously it was more than four people that bought it

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But the sad thing is you know like you go to Fry's

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Which is a big electronics store here in California

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
There were tons and tons of them sitting in the discount bin

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I think Nintendo just had higher hopes for the game

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
It just got so discounted so quick

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Because like people saw the music list and were like

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh it's crappy

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Well yeah the music normally would be crappy

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
But inside the game it was really good

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
September with the cutscenes made you feel epic

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
September that was the

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
That was the one about

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And she makes the best hamburgers too

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I love that one

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
That's a really good one

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
See and people just didn't give enough of a chance

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's not J-pop so why would they care

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Elite Beat Agents

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I can discount Elite Beat Agents on account of one song

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And one song only

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And that would be Canned Heat

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
It was a bad cover

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
But the story was hilarious

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It was a bad cover of a good song with a great story

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
But it was offbeat

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
It was not so badly offbeat

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Oh good job, good research Katamari's Forever

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Says the actual number of copies sold

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
16,000 per VG charts

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Wow

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
That's practically 4

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I mean when you consider that there's a lot of crappy games

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That sell way more than that

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
It's kind of sad

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah but 16,000 that's not much bigger than 4

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's really not

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Not in the scope of things

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Not for a video game

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It's 4 times 4,000

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah I was close

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
I had one number right

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Alright

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Plus Elite Beat Agents can kind of make you cry

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
You know because it has the sad stage

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
There's always the sad stage

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Which one had the chris

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
There was the Christmas one

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
You're the Inspiration

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
That's the one for that game

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
All the sad stages are sad except for Oh and Don 1

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
That one wasn't so sad

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
But DJ Ratchet's right

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
You're the Inspiration had some hilarious screw up scenes

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
It really does

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Yes

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Like when you see the dad in like a speedo

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
That cracked me up

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
The only thing that was more epic than say September in Oh and Don

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Would be doing Ready Steady Go saving the world from a giant meteor

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
That was so epic it was hilarious

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I like Oh and Don 2's epic stage

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
It was cooler

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I don't even remember what happens

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
But I just remember I liked the song better

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And it was more fun to play

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
By the way spoilers for a music game

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
That's alright

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
I was just realizing is it really 16,000 or is it 160,000

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
It can't be 16,000

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
There's no way

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Let me look hold on

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
It has to be 160

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I'm going to look

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
America

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
I'll find the answer

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
While we get into other stuff throughout the show

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
If it is 16,000

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah there's a reason right there

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Why we'll never get one

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Cause I'm thinking like

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
God I have Judgement sold more than that game

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
That's sad

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Alright

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Housekeeping tonight

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
Tonight is our sixth anniversary show

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Yay

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Orange launch

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Can I get a yay

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Yay

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Alright

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Orange launch radio started on June 23, 2008

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And it was about as exciting as this episode

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Allgames.com relaunched this week

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
They have a whole new look

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Check it out

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
www.allgames.com

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
That is of course the site

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Where we broadcast from every Sunday Night Live

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
If you've only ever listened to us on your iPod

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Or other type of portable device like PSP

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
What have you

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
You're subscribing to our feed

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Check us out live sometime

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Sunday nights

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
We tape at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
9 o'clock Eastern

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Just like

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I want to say Dreadlock Lord in chat

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Is joining us for the first time

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I think he was saying before the show

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
So welcome

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Be cool like him

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Come listen to a new show

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
And I wanted to say

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Thanks to me going back

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And playing Guitar Hero 3 this week

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I actually thought to check

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
On the Guitar Hero OL Army

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
And I had to go back

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
And approve requests to join

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
From like February

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
So if I neglected to add you to the OL Army

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
You're there now

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
And if you want to join the OL Army

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Go to the Guitar Hero community site

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And search for OLRMY

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
And you too can join our Guitar Hero OL Army

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Which I promise I will update more than once

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Every four months

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Also if you missed it in part B last week

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
We had a pretty cool announcement

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Joining us next week on the program

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Tommy Tallarico will be here

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
For an extended interview

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Where he's going to talk about video games live

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And his involvement with GANG

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Which is a big audio guild

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
For people that are into making audio for games

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Whether they're already doing it

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Or just have an interest in it

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And more video games live

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Because it's what lots of people

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Are talking about right now

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Tommy's going to be here to join us

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Talk a lot about that

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It's pretty cool

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I'll be next week here on Orange Lounge Radio

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
But for tonight

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Since this is the sixth anniversary

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
We do have some special things planned

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
For you in part B

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
We're going to bring back

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
These segments

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
From OLR's history

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
And one of them is going to be music game related

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
We're going to do a list list in part B tonight

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
And it does have to do with music games

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
So that'll be pretty exciting

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Especially for our long time listeners

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Who remember our roots

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
For now though

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Gaming news throughout the gaming world

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
We'll start it off with Loki

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Yes, this week we had a brand new firmware update

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
For the PSP

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
And it didn't really add a whole lot

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Except for the ability to search on Google

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Straight from the cross media bar

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
And also the other thing that they added along with that

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Was now that you can change the viewing speed

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
During video playback

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
By pressing the up and down buttons

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
While you're watching a video

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Yay

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
And I'm sure they also tried to fix some other holes

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That were opened up

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Allowing people to run homebrew and stuff

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
And I know that they're already working on custom firmware 4.0

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
So

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
That doesn't work

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Why is it that they're calling it 4.0?

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Probably because they had so many updates

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That were getting close to 4.0 anyways

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's like 3.96 and stuff

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Might as well just go 4.0

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Because I guess they would consider the internet search function

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
As a brand new feature or something like that

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Instead of just a little update

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I don't know, I think they're just running out of numbers

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Okay

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Going back to Elite Beat Agents for a minute

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Because this news about the 4.0 firmware kind of bores me

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Because they really didn't do much to call this 4.0

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I was expecting something a little more landmark

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Going back to Elite Beat Agents

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
It actually sold.17 million

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Which would be 170,000 copies

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Not 16,000

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
That must have been just in the first week or something

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Yay, that's still not enough to get another game

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
And that's also still not as much as

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Eye of Judgment, right?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But that is only released though in two regions though

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
So you have to also count

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Whatever

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Owen Dunn

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Eye of Judgment has sold.21 million copies

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Granted, that's worldwide

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
It didn't sell better than Crysis

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Let's see

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Comparing it to some other games

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Let's see, Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Oh, we don't have sales data for that

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Let's see, what are some of these other ones?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Maybe I can find

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Ah, there we go

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Barbie Island Princess on the DS

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
.14 million copies

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
That's only 30,000 less than Owen Dunn

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
How about Elite Beat Agents?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Let's Ride Friends Forever

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Not in the database

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Awesome, it's so crappy it's not even there

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
What about Imagine Babies?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Oh wait, I found Let's Ride Friends Forever

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Imagine Babies? You'd be surprised

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It's actually in the top selling

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
DS titles

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I honestly don't understand

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Wow, wow, wow, get this

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Do you know how many copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
sold in its first week of release?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
No

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
986

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Ok, I'm sorry

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
So yeah, you're about

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
What is it?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
200 or

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
211,000

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
copies now of Eye Judgment

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Ok, wow

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Wow

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Ok, thank god

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm sorry

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Elite Beat Agents

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
170,000 copies, right?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Imagine Babies, you ready for this?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
1.85 million copies

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
have sold

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
That's per VGCharts.com

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
That makes sense though

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It's seriously, it's weird

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
People buy it for their little girls

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Cause they want them to know how to raise their babies

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It's absolutely weird, that game right there

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
is like, seriously up in the top

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
of the DS charts and also

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Imagine Fashion Designer is up there too

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Ok, iVal

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Since I own the game thanks to somebody

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
in this room

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I'm going to play Imagine Babies

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
this week

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Come back and report on it

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
You better be good on it

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Also, Breaking a Million copies sold

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Happy Cooking

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
How many did Cookie Mama sell?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Last one

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Cookie Mama

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Elite Beat Agents sold 170,000

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Cookie Mama sold 2.74 million copies

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
What about Cookie Mama 2? Cause I don't think that did as well

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Cookie Mama 2

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
1.19 million, keep in mind these are worldwide numbers

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Crazy

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Alright, I'm done

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Thank god I wasn't like

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Imagine Babies, no one will buy that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Let's just add that to the thing

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah, see, I'm smart

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
You are very smart

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It's a good thing you didn't take that as part of the bet

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Alright, let's see

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Sony planning a clamp down on PSP

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Pirating

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
That's right, there is a piracy problem

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
on the PSP

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
said Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
President David Reeves

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And we know about it

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
We know how it's done

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
So basically they know how to

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
log on to any of the many blogs out there

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
that specifically talk about PSP hacking

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Right, they're gonna really clamp down on PSP piracy

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
These were quotes from

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Sony's Devastation

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Developer Conference

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
that was held in London

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And it's not all bad news

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
because

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
sometimes piracy, says

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
David Reeves,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
fuels the growth of hardware sales

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So people

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
buy PSP, and you know what, I actually kind of see that

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
because a lot of people bought the PSP

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
when they found out that they were able to

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
play NES games on them

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It's kind of true

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I know a lot of people that when they first got them, that's all they did

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
They had me put emulators on there for them

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
and they played NES games

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
One of my friends went right out and bought one and then modded his battery

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Here's one thing to

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
note though, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
He went on to say that

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
there are plans going on

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that will crack down on the numbers

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
of pirates out there, but

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
There is nothing they can do, absolutely

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
nothing, they have said this forever

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
and they have tried different methods

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and it's slowed people down

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
but then eventually they come back around

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
and they find a new way about it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
You have no chance, make your time

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It's just like

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
we're gonna get to another story about another system later

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and the same damn thing is going on there

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
It's ridiculous

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
People, I wish they would learn

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
there is nothing they can do

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
because as soon as they make

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
more of a bigger deal about it

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
that's when people start finding out about it

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
and then they start, oh hey I can do that now

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I didn't know

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
When was the last time that you heard about

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
hacking being done on the Playstation 3?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I've heard of them

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
actually trying things

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
but they still haven't gotten anything to work yet

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
If I'm not mistaken, Playstation 3 has a more

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
don't give a shit attitude towards like

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
installing Linux on it and all that stuff

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
That's why people don't care

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
People are looking

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
to find ways to run homebrew stuff

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
on it, I think mainly

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
they're trying to find ways to pirate stuff

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
but even stuff, even let's just say

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
you were able to pirate games on the PS3

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
it's not really

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
as easy because

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
if you dump a Playstation 3 game

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
that's upwards to 50 gigs

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
you're only going to be able to

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
throw one or two on your hard drive

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
at a time

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
it's just more cumbersome

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
just say forget it

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and they'll do it on the 360 instead

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Before we get to our next story

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
a comment from chat, Amaze Satsuma in chat

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
says there is one way to stop pirates

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
send ninjas out to kill them

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
There you have it

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
But you know what though

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
there are ninjas that are

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
you know, acting in

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
they're participating in

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
piracy actually, there's the Wii Ninja

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
which is a mod chip

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
for the Wii that allows you to play pirated games

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Sairan

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
in chat says what is a pirate

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
a miserable little pile of hacks

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
but enough talk

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
have at you

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
please save us from this

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
nonsense in our chat room

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
while we get to another story

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Rob, you killed it

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Hey, I didn't say it, Sairan said it

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Do I gotta?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Well, some news about the MMO that

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
BioWare is

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
squirting out

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
they said that it's supposed to be out

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
between April 2010 and

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
April 2011

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
um

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
well

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
the article actually said

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
that EA was funding an MMO

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
but EA owns BioWare

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
and it's in Austin

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
so that's where they got the information from

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
and um

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
there's no more uh

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
information exactly about what it's gonna be

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
but the theory is Knights of the Old Republic

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
so

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
hmm

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
possible

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
hmm, that could be interesting

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
hmm, you say

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
anyways

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
there's gonna be some pretty interesting

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
stuff coming out about Resistance 2

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
of course just recently they had some gameplay

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
videos that were premiering on

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
GameTrailersTV and

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
now GamePro has

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
the scoop on some more stuff including

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
they're gonna be giving out

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
in random issues of GamePro

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
free Resistance 2 beta codes

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
so you'll be able to get in on

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
the beta for that and they're hoping to sell

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
a few more magazines with that as well cause

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't know about you but I don't think GamePro's

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
doing that great right now. And there's some people

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
out there that would buy like 10 copies to get a

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
golden ticket quote unquote right? Yeah pretty

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
much. Did they say about how many of the magazines

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
are gonna have this? Nope.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Interesting. But they were saying that

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
there's tons of juicy

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
stuff in there and they're saying

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
it's bigger than Halo

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
bigger than Call of Duty

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I'm sorry though or you know

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
better than Halo they said

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
a lot of things are better than Halo

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
unfortunately

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
but Resistance 2

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
is gonna be awesome. Resistance 1 was

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
absolutely cool. If you loved

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Call of Duty and you want more of a

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
sci-fi game this is perfect

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
for you.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Of course and I don't think it made tonight's show

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
roll but I want to say something I read something about

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Call of Duty 6 is supposed to be like sci-fi

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
related. Is that a response

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
to this? No I would think

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
they're just getting

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
they're trying to mix it up a bit but

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
you know I don't know if that

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
worked really well for Battlefield

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
2142 either though because

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
they tried to mix it up a bit and go a little sci-fi

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and futuristic you know

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Tom Clancy's been doing that or

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
the Tom Clancy series I guess

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
you know with Hawks and

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
End War and that kind of stuff but

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
you know I honestly

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
think that Resistance 2 is gonna be awesome. Resistance

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I absolutely out of the first person shooters I've played

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Gears of War, Halo 3

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
just

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
a lot of them out there

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Resistance was my favorite

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
absolutely which is weird because you know

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
usually I'm not too favorable on

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
stuff for the Playstation 3

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
but you know it honestly is a good game

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and I'm definitely buying the next one

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Alright

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I'm just kinda reading

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
some other crazy stuff in chat

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
DJ Ratchet speculates

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
it ends up only 5 game pros have it

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
so it actually does turn into

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Willy Wonka. Well they're assuming that's gonna be over

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
60 since they're

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
obviously gonna be stress testing

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
servers so you know

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
there's gonna be 60 player online with

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Resistance 2. Will there be more

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Resistance 2 beta keys than

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
copies of Elite Beat Agents sold?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I don't think so.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Alright I promise no more

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
sales figures but I lied

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
cause this is actually something a little more current

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 should be noted

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
that Fumitsu Magazine has

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
reported that over in Japan

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
since Fumitsu Magazine is in Japan

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
476,334

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
copies were sold

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
in the first week

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
and

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
by the way 77,208

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
consoles

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
were sold that week and that is

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
like if you kinda do the math there that's

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
what about like 1 in 4

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
no 1 in 5?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
so like 1 out of every 5

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
copies of the game sold also

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
pushed a console. That's pretty

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
big. There you have it

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
over in the UK

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
cause 1 out of every 5

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
copies was probably one of those

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
consoles that included the

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
game with it possibly

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
over in the UK it should be noted that

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 well it sold well it did not

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
do quite as well as Grand Theft Auto

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
4. It was 14,000

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
copies short

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
of the Metal Gear Solid 2 release

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
in 2002

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
See I have a bad feeling

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
that they're gonna start really

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
budging their numbers with

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
oh yeah look how many consoles this

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
game pushed. Well yeah because

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
you're including it with all the consoles. Of course

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
it's gonna be

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
kind of equal with

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the console sales. You know

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
what though? We even know people that have

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
went out and bought a Playstation 3 just for this

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
game. Yeah I could believe it.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I mean it's an awesome game.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But then again when Final Fantasy 13 comes out

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I will probably buy a Playstation 3 just

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
for that game so what can you do? Well don't worry

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
about that time you know the Playstation 4

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
will be coming out so. Hurray!

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Plus maybe Sony

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Home I'll actually have to play as well

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Yeah I'm sure it'll eventually be

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
out in beta form of course.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Well

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
for other news if

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
anyone's been interested

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
in LittleBigPlanet

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the Sony experience is coming

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
by on a bunch of trucks

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
that has different kiosks

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
with games in it such as

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Turismo 5 Prologue, Metal Gear Solid 4

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
and PSP games

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and it's traveling all over

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
the country so if you go to

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
us.playstation.com

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
you can find links to

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
tour dates there. Do you happen to have the dates

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
in front of you by chance? I was just wondering if there's

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
anything local where you can go crash. There's

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
very few tour dates.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
That's alright.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So not a big tour right now. No it's like

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
each truck's doing like four different

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
cities and that's it. Huh.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Actually I have

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
three locations according to this one.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And that's just Baltimore

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
and Milwaukee. But maybe

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
more to come. Maybe.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Cause when that Rock Band tour

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
started didn't they only have a few dates and then

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
finally it like exploded into like all

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
these places before the game came out. Okay here we go.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Oh yes. The

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
PlayStation Patrol tour

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
is going to Davenport

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Iowa, Huntsville Alabama.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I should go visit my family. No.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Trevor City Michigan and

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
New York City.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Why they gotta hate the West Coast?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Not a single

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
West Coast date in there.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But the New York City date is July 11th

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
through July 15th so if any of our listeners

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
get the urge go check it out

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
for us. Yeah and please go ask them why they hate

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
us so much on the West Coast. Oh.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
They were probably

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
already here and I didn't even care.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
They've

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
been here before. They usually come to our

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
local sunrise fall every now and then.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
But you know we had the signing of the

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Metreon right? Yes that's true.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I didn't see no

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
little big planet there.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I just saw you know. Who cares about Metal Gear Solid?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
It's all about little big planets.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I'm no longer falling.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Alright go

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
follow the tour bus or something

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
and if you happen to go you know

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
take a camera or something and tell us about

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
your experience. Anyways there was a whole

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
bunch of drama last week with

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Itagaki leaving Tecmo

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
and Team Ninja behind.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I am surprised he did not tip over

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
everything on his way out.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
If he has we probably just

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
haven't heard it yet. Exactly he probably

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
just you know threw a manager through a window

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and then jumped down you know.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
While setting the building on fire and

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
it just blew up behind him in like an elaborate

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
explosion. See that's the thing

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
is you know he does it in style.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Everything. Everything he does.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Anyways

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
so they have

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
served a gag

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
order for him to

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
basically not disclose or

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
leak any Tecmo trade

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
secrets and you know

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
make any false or misleading statements

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
etc. etc. The only problem is though

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
it hasn't been signed off by the court yet so he's

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
talking now.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Yeah so Itagaki put out a press statement

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
of his own that says you don't tell me to shut the fuck

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
up.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I come back and kill you again.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I do what I want.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Now his his his press

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
statement when it was faxed out it was

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
just a big middle finger.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
And then it burst into fire.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Because he's that awesome.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
He's such a rock star.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I bet it was on paper that's

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
flammable as soon as it opened.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Have we had the

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
burning finger. Have we had the concept

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
on this show before to have a

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
game where you just you are Itagaki.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I mean this would be a great

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
now like like before it's like where what

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
could the game be like you know oh you're

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
just you're Itagaki you sleep with chicks you burn

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
hotel rooms down understand now

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
now we have a purpose because he got kicked

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
out of Tecmo now you got now you have

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
good motives yes and

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
motive well there could definitely be a game here.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
We're going to elevate him to a

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Chuck Norris status you know he's going to

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
be immortal at some point.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
He is the Chuck Norris of game designers really.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Anyways

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Itagaki. He laughs at Chuck Norris.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Yes.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
He doesn't have to do anything better than Chuck

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Norris because you think Chuck Norris is fucking funny.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Of course Tecmo

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
the man denies that

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Team Ninja is actually leaving them

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
and also

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
kind of denying different aspects about the lawsuit.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
One of the things that they say

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
was inaccurate was that all of the

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
employees were suing

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Tecmo. Well

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
yes and no it's actually two employees suing

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Tecmo on behalf of

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
all the other employees so

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I'd like some sort of convoluted class

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
action. Yeah there's a whole lot of weird

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
stuff going on there. Japanese law is

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
kind of funny anyway. Not paying overtime

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and that kind of thing you know.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I don't know.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Is this why you know

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Tecmo Bowl is just

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
taking forever to come out. Team Ninja doesn't do

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Tecmo Bowl. I understand. Team Ninja should

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
do Tecmo Bowl.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Ninja Bowl

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
that'll be fun.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Rob do you remember Battle Chess?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh yeah hell yeah. Where they would like

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
kill each other and everything. That was awesome.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
They should have like battle football.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
All right.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Well listen this is what

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Itagaki's new job is going to be

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
okay.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Basically if you imagine

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
you know like a kitchen

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
stadium except it's not

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
a kitchen stadium it's just a

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
stadium with Itagaki being

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
the chairman and he has people fight each

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
other to the death with a secret weapon

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
that is revealed on each show.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I like it.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
So Itagaki should not be so worried

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
about this divorce from Tecmo because he will be

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
a rock star elsewhere. Oh yeah they'll pick him up

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
that Microsoft will probably have him work

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
for him.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Nice.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Meanwhile in another part of the galaxy

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Sony is

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
they're kind of fiddling

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
with this whole idea of getting into the

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
gaming phone.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You know especially because

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Apple you know you heard them at the

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
conference a couple weeks ago they announced

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
you know that the iPhone is expanding into more

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
and more gaming outlets when they showed the

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
pictures of Monkey Ball and all this stuff.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
It looks like

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Sony might be getting into gaming a little more

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
themselves. It's Sony Ericsson

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
F30

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
or 05 the F305

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
is this new model of Sony Ericsson

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
it kind of sort of like

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
has this giant screen on it that's iPhone

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
ish. But here's the thing that's interesting

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
about it. There's a up down

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
left right little control maneuver. Okay

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
well whatever you probably seen those on the phone although that looks

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
kind of like a game controller. But the buttons

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
are also labeled X and O just

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
kind of like you would have on a Playstation

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
controller. And

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the system here little Sony Ericsson

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
comes with games on it.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Bowling bash fishing

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and jockey and it

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
all of them use an accelerometer

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
that is actually located inside

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
the device as well. Why in the hell does

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
your phone need an accelerometer. I'm not sure

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
unless like it knows to shut off

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
if it's falling out of your pocket or something

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I don't know. But

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
it does have one in it.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Or if it senses that you're falling

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
for a long time it's like you're falling

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
to your death. Do you wish to call loved ones.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
Yes or no.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Oh nice.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
It shouldn't

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
ask you yes or no because all it's going to get is

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
it's

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
all it's going to get

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
because I think if you're falling out of a plane

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
your death you're not going to have time to say oh

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
yes. Hey I don't know

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
are you trying to tell me though that

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
no wait I mean cake

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
are

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
you trying to tell me that crank was

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
fake. That movie was fake

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
that he couldn't like fall out of

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
a helicopter and have time to call his loved

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
one on the cell phone and then land and

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
die. It

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
was fake in the movie but it was real

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
when it got he did it

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
said he landed and he's like fuck this

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I'm too cool to die and then shot the

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
plane down. All right.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
All

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
right. Well how

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
about some completely innocent and happy

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
news. No

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Disney

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
this makes me kind of

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I just think it's funny because I'm going to have to

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
draw the parallel okay.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Disney is making a

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
game about a dog

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
who shoots laser beams

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
from his eyes and

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
barks with a sonic boom. Wait a minute

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I think I've heard

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
of this game before.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
What. Go ahead continue on.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
It's an animated movie.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
And his owner is called Penny

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
who besides me is thinking

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Inspector Gadget.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I'm sorry brain is not that cool.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Okay but

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
it's a girl named Penny who

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
who hacks. She's a hacker.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
This is Inspector Gadget

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
but with the cooler dog. Little kids are not

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
hackers. It's like you mix

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Inspector Gadget and the dog and

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
give him John Travolta's voice. Wait I have a

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
question for the nerdy wait

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I have a question for nerdy

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Yeah.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
PSP

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
and it's going to tie in with

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
a movie about a famous

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
dog with super powers

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
on a television show and gets shipped to New York

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
by accident so he's trying to get back to Hollywood

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and John Travolta is doing his

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
voice.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
And for those people who may be interested

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
still is animated by the same people

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
that did

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
or the same artist I should say that did

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Lilo and Stitch so

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
it's pretty cool. Alright let's check out

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
pigtails equals handles

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
scientific research that has to be done

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
here at Orange Lounge Radio

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
anyhow so

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
girls or animated

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
dogs you may be interested

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
in more Mortal Kombat

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
vs. DC Universe news

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
in fact

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
there are some more characters confirmed

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
for the game

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
including

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
the

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Flash, Robin

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Wonder Woman, Green

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Lantern, Black Canary

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Hawkman and Power

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Girl cool

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
she's got big boobs

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
sorry

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
no you know what I'm glad she said that because

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I don't really follow comics I have no idea who

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Power Girl is like is she a girl dressed up like

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
a Duracell battery or something I have to

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Power Girl is actually Super

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Girl from a different universe so she's exactly

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
the same person as Supergirl that has these humongous

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
boobs that's like the only difference

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Big Breasted Universe I can dig that

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I can dig that

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
anyways they're also saying

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
that there's

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
a possible two game deal

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and download content

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
as well she has big

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
boobies look at that

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
no look at the picture that Alex Ross

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
did okay I'm looking at wait now

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
but hold on on this Justice League

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Unlimited that's the stupid cartoon

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
well she does not have big boobies there

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
she has weird

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
her boobs look like a cucumber

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
stuffed down her shirt and that one

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
look at Power Girl and Alex

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Ross and look at that that's the picture he did

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
yes

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
those are

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
wow I think I saw boobs like that

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
on the Jerry Springer show once that's about it

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
alright

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
gee I have no idea why that character was

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
picked for the game I mean

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Robin I've heard of Wonder Woman I've heard

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
of pretty much every single one of those other characters

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
you've named I've heard of Power Girl

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I had never heard of but now I understand why

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
she's in the game

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I want the

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Joker though I want Harley

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I want Harley Quinn

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
what's up with that

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
what's up with that what is up with that

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
alright what's up with this

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
yeah seriously like if you look at some of these

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
just do like a

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Google image search they've got

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
one that's like

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
crap

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
wow

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
that's a little over the top

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
massive approval

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Loki had you ever heard

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
of Power Girl before tonight

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
nope

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
but now you'll never forget

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
no I probably will alright

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I'm not a big

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I've made no secret of it that I'm not

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
the world's biggest DC fan

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
but I've got characters I like

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
and I like her because she's bitchy

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
she's fair

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
and she's got boobs

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
hitstun says Harley Quinn

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
was the first character I made in Soul Calibur 3

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
in the create your own character mode

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I think the first character I made

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
was a totally naked person wearing

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
a bishop's hat

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
that did like capoeira dancing

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
or something it was crazy

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
alright

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
anyhow I have no idea

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
how to segue into this story

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
so I will just say the ESRB

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
is sadly going to

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
probably no longer be

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
leaking game announcements early

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
cause you know we find out about all these cool games

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
cause they show up on the ESRB's website

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
there was Earthbound coming to the Wii

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
we found out about that early

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Castlevania

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
the full name of that game

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
why are you still laughing Loki

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
so speaking of big boobs

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I hear giggling in my right ear

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
oh it's Andrew

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
he started off a joke

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and I don't know where it's going

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
is it from the toilet paper book

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I was going to say though

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
yeah it sucks that the ESRB

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
wait wait I didn't even say why

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
let me finish the story

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
now

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
when these companies submit the games to get the rating

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
they can actually fill in a date

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
when the title will be uploaded

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
on the ESRB's website

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
if the company for whatever reason doesn't fill it out

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
though it will automatically

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
go on the website 30 days after it's rated

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
so basically companies can now choose

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
what date the game will go on the website

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
but the ESRB is saying don't abuse this

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
which is kind of interesting

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
in the memo that went out about this

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
quote the ESRB system will not work for consumers

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
if publishers arbitrarily

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
select dates bearing no reasonable

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
relationships to consumers interest

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
in the product

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
but it should be noted this would still have

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
no effect on some of the other ways that games

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
have been leaked through official agencies

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
such as the OFLC in Australia

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
exactly

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
now Loki

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
you had a comment

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
that's exactly what I was going to say

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
well that doesn't stop everybody else from doing it

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
and besides you know

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
there's a lot of other ways to find out about leaked dates

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
but you don't know of any of them right?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
of course not

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
alright well you know what

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't know about you guys but I kind of liked

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
when the ESRB would leak things early

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
and now I feel like I'm going to be sitting in the dark

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
until they want me to know about released dates

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
and I like ruining Christmas

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I like finding out about stuff early

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
so this ESRB news

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
kind of makes me a little bit angsty

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
and when I get angsty we cue the FU music

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
music

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
just a massive FU

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
to the assholes

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
on the Ragnarok server I play on

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
who are duplicating items

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and selling them and basically

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
doing a whole bunch of shit that's now

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I wouldn't say it's completely ruined everything

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
but it's made things difficult for other people

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
so

57:28.000 --> 57:54.000
FU to them

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I have two FUs of the week

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
my first FU goes to me

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
for spending $10 to go watch The Happening

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
which was horrible

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
and not even like so bad it was good

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
like Showgirls

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
you know bad

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
but it was just bad

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
it was really really bad

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
my other FU goes to the fact

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
this is a much bigger FU

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
my other FU goes to the fact that I had to have not just one

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
but two MRIs last week

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I went in for an MRI

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
if you've been listening to this show the past three months

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I've been having issues with my pancreas

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
that kept me out a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
blah blah blah cry me a river

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
but I was having a follow up appointment to check on my pancreas

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
on Thursday I had an MRI

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
and I don't know if you've ever had an MRI done

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
but if you have to drink this really nasty stuff

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
before you have an MRI

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
it's wretched

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
this barium stuff is wretched

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
they were probably trying to eliminate your pancreas

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
well no

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
it's not so much that

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
it's horrible but having to leave work early

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
go to this place or whatever

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
so I went in on Thursday had it done

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
they called me at five o'clock at night

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
oh Rob the thing that your doctor

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
wanted to see doesn't come out

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
clear in our MRI thing

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
because we have an older MRI thing out here in Folsom

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
we need you to go to our Roseville office

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
where they have a newer MRI machine

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
things you could have told me about

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
the first time

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
it wasn't written on there what my doctor was looking for

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
or nothing I mean if you didn't think it was going to come up on the old one

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
why didn't you just tell me to go to the new place to start with

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
instead of making me miss two days of work

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
and have to drink that nasty nasty stuff twice

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
so

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
but anyway I'm hoping the MRIs

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
show that I'm healthy again

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
because otherwise I'll be filled with more FUs

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
and nobody wants that

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Andrew

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
first of all FU to GameStop

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
for closing at six on Sundays

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I was going to go in and

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
apparently they were giving away deoxys

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
at GameStop all weekend

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
just missed by two minutes

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
D'oh!

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
FU to the community

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
on Team Fortress 2

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Achievement Pack comes out for say

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Pyro, what do you have? All sorts of

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Pyros on the servers, nothing else

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
easy pickings were heavy though

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and FU to Hellgate

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
for being such a bitch and a half to install

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000

it's neat

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
kind of interesting

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I'll give it, it's different

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
it's not a bad thing

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
that the fitness craze has taken over

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
in the video game world right now

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
better than nothing

favorite Final Fantasy Tactics

The Midnight Play Pack on the DS

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000

Code Lyoko Fall of

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000

Overlord and all the other expansions for that

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Let's see here

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Elements on the

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
PC

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I think there's one other thing I missed here

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Let's see here

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Cake Mania 2 on the DS

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Deadliest Catch

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Alaskan Storm on

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Xbox 360 if you want to

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
be a crab fisher I guess

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Guitar Hero

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Aerosmith that's coming out on

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Playstation 2, Xbox 360

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
PS3 and

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
the Wii as well as

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
bundles and all those

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
and that

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
would be it

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
That's a pretty busy week for games

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
here in America even though there's not a whole lot of

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
AAA titles

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I guess maybe Guitar Hero Aerosmith and Guitar Hero

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
on tour but not a lot of huge stuff

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
but pretty busy

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Alone in the Dark was pretty awesome

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Well you know it's not been

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
getting great reviews

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I heard that it got leaked out already

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Yeah there was a little bit of controversy

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
over that because Atari is

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
accusing people of

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Well you know, fuck them, seriously

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
They were pissed off that someone was reviewing

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
the game

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
prior to being released because

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
they weren't one of their authorized reviewers

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
or whatever

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and to their offense

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
they didn't play a pirated version

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
it's just they got one that someone broke

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
street on so it's not

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
necessarily their fault but I

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
still think it's fucked up that Atari's like

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
oh we don't want any independent reviews

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
out there because god forbid it

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I would have told them I was going to give it a good

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
review but fuck you

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I don't know, it's annoying

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and let's not forget

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
though, and we do have another story about

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
this game, but let's not forget that Driver 3

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Atari paid off people

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
to give it good reviews

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Just keep that fresh in your mind

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Yikes

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Rapid Slasher in chat

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
says if you buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
you are a tool

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
My husband's buying it, take it back

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I'm thinking of buying it too

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
My husband's buying it, take it back

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
You don't want to face the wrath of Jamie

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Alright, it is a waste of money in my opinion

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
but you know, I don't care for

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
these add-on games that are coming out in the

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
middle there

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I mean, you could put that stuff out as download

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
content I think the song list

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
could have been a little better because I saw

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
the finalized song list today and you know

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I just don't understand why they can't do

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
like say like a $20 download

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
thing or something like that for

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Guitar Hero 3 and just call it

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
because they did that with was it

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Samurai Warriors 2, Empires

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
or something like that, they were going to

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
release its own 360 game for that

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
but they decided, hey, you know what

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
it's not really that much different, I mean

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
it's just kind of an add-on, so we're just going to

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
release this as download content and that's what they did

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I don't understand why they just don't do that with this

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
He took it back

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Probably because of the PS2 owners

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Damn right he took it back

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Yeah, but you can release it on those systems

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
but just don't release it

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Just like the rock band Track Packs

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
They can release that stuff

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
standalone or you can do a download

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
for cheaper

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Now Rapid Slasher clarifies the comment and says

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
it's just that the song list is really weak

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
and I kind of agree

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
My husband's favorite band is Aerosmith

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
He probably won't be too interested in

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Guitar Hero Metallica next year

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
That's for me

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Guitar Hero Tool isn't a bad idea though

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Yeah, I mean

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I like Aerosmith and all

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
but I'm more of just a fan of Guitar Hero

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and I wouldn't mind having a lot of

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
new songs to play from

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I'm not buying any of these games

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
until Guitar Hero DVDA comes out

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I kind of

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
want a new guitar too, my other one is starting

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
to break, I've had a guitar hero too

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
but I need a guitar that's going to be compatible

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
with rock band, I'm just not interested

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Well then you probably don't want a Guitar Hero

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
guitar

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
God, so stupid, I hate both of those companies

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I really shouldn't

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
buy any of these games anymore

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
until they find a way to make it work

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Well the 360 though, you do have to remember though

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
that they are at least compatible with each other

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
whereas if you had a PS3 you're fucked

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Alright

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Dark Tetsuya says Guitar Hero Journey

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Yes, I would be there first in line, I'd pre-order it

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
the minute it was announced

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Anyhow, getting over to Japanese

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
release dates, my usual source

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
of information of Japanese release dates is not working

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
right now so I have an abbreviated list for you guys

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Over in Japan this week

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
on the Xbox 360, they get Battlefield

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Bad Company comes out

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
on the Playstation 3, The Darkness finally makes its way

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
to Japan as well as Quake Wars

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
or Enemy Territory Quake Wars

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and on the Nintendo Re

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
did I say Nintendo Re?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The Re

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
The Re, the Wii, Ford Racing

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Ford Racing Offroad

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
was what I was starting to say

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
but somehow combined it all into one word

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Lovely

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Alright, that's going to do it for release dates

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Well, there's other stuff

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
in case anyone is interested

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
and I am particularly interested

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
in this myself

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Okay, you know what one of my favorite games ever is?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Custer's Revenge

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Hell no, Dragon's Lair

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and the 25th anniversary of Dragon's Lair

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
is coming about and so

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
the

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
artistic, I would say

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
well, the animator

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
that's behind it, Don Bluth

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
is

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
from what I understand

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
is going to be doing

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
an autographed

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
version of the game for

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
a week that will be on

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
DVD, PC, Blu-Ray

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
and it's also going to be designed by

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Rick Dyer who was the designer

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and two of the other animators

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Hopefully the Blu-Ray version actually

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
works this time instead of

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
it being broken

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Well, they said the

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Blu-Ray version is

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
supposed to run at 1080p

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
and play just like the

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
original coin-op version

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and there's supposed to be lobby

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
posters that are $80 each

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Geez

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Can we get Space Ace while we're at it?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I know, right? Well, maybe

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
when the anniversary for Space Ace comes about

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
How about they just animate a new

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Dragon's Lair 3

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I would like to get a

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Commodore 64 signed copy of the game

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I'll tell you what, if you've never seen

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Dragon's Lair and the Commodore 64, go check out

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
some old videos of it on YouTube

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Not only was the game insanely hard

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I mean, insanely freaking

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
hard, harder than the actual arcade game

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I will say

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It was kind of creepy

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Like, the music in it was very creepy

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Look it up

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's an animated game that's done

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
just like Dragon's Lair

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Who's driving car? Bear's driving car! Left!

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I don't know

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
There could be a clerk's game

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
somewhere, I'm just not sure that's it

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Yeah, but I don't think the market's real open for

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
in-action games

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Wah wah

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
It said it right in front of me

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
if you're looking for something a little bit more

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
action-packed, then perhaps

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
you need a game that comes

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
with a gun

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yes, actually there is a brand new

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Nerf N-Strike game

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
coming out from EA

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That will feature a gun peripheral

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
for the Wii that's kind of like, you know

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
something that you strap the remote into

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
But, when you're not playing

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
the Wii, you can actually turn it into a real

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Nerf gun and fire at people's heads

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Like God intended it

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It will be

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
$59.99

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And we'll include of course

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
the gun shell, it's due out November

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
17th

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
No word on what it is, but hey

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
it comes with a gun, so you know, if the game sucks

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
you can go play outside

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
It's Nerf the game, what else do you need to know?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Yes, the Nerf game has been

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Nerfed, I heard

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Alright, anyhow

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We're about

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
done with the first half here of episode

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
number 284, our 6th anniversary

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
show, but we could not say goodbye

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
to part A without taking a moment as we have

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
for quite a while now here on the program

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and paying respect to our elders, and we do that

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
through a little segment we like to call

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
The Classic Video Game of the Week, where Jamie's

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
going to dig through the archives

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
and pick a game in the dusty

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
corner of a closet that she thinks

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
needs a little more respect from you kids

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
that were only 7 years old when the show

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
started, and so on, so

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Dark Soccer, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
It's a game that I literally tripped on

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
this morning in the vault

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
it had fallen, and I tripped on it

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's SMK Gals Fighter

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
which was on Neo Geo

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Pocket Color in 2000

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Play some of that music

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Dig that 8-bit music

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
You know what

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
there's a

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
my friend over at the local

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
plan trade has one of those

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
and he says he'll sell it to me if

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I wanted it

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I don't know what I'd do with that

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
It has a really good version of Bubble Bobble on it

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I'm sorry, Puzzle Bobble

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I can only play so many versions

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
of Puzzle Bobble

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
We used to keep it in our bathroom

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It has Neo Geo Card Fighters

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
on it

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Card Fighters Clash was actually pretty cool

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
but anyway

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
you've got

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
basically different SMK female

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
characters, hence

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
SMK Gals Fighters

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
that are playable in the game

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
It's a 2D, sorta weird mono color

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Neo Geo Pocket Color

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
did not have that great of a color

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
capability, so

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
the characters are pretty monotone

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and they're all

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
SD sprites, so it's pretty cute

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
However

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
the characters that are in this game

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
are, you have

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Mai, Shiranui

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Athena, Yuri

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Leona, Shirmi

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
who I named my cat after

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Nakaru, Shiki, Akari

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
from The Last Blade

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Hidden are also Whip from King of Fighters

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
and Yuki Kushinata

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
from King of Fighters 97

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and your boss is Miss X

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
which I think is funny

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Rob, do you remember

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
that Margaret Cho sketch

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
she talked about being raised by drag queens

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
and one of them was named Miss X

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and Miss X is Iori Yagami in drag

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Nice

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
So I thought I would share that

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And actually

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
one of the characters

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yuki

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
is actually

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
the one I was mentioning before

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
is actually Kyo's girlfriend

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and it's the only game she's ever fought in

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
A bunch of the other guys make

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
cameos, like you have

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Kyo, Ryo, Takuma

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Seikenso

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
and

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yashiro, a few other people

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
so it's pretty cool

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and some of the moves were

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
altered to look funny

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
so

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
there you go, Gals Fighter

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Alright, your classic

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
video game of the week, Gals Fighter

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Have I given the Neo Geo Pocket Color

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
any love yet? I think that is the

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
first Neo Geo Pocket Color love we've had here

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
on the program. It was about time

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So there you have it

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in our Part B

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
and tonight, Listless

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
returns to Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
It's where you guys in chat will have a say

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Making the definitive list, and this has been a list

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
ten years in the making, we are going

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
to decide tonight the best Bamani song

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
of the past ten years. We're going back to our roots

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
