14860	19260	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19260	26660	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June 29th, 2008, for part B of our podcast.
26660	32920	Remember, Orange Lounge Radio tapes on Sunday nights live on All Games Radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
32920	36520	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at www.allgames.com
36520	41120	and then it releases in a podcast form twice a week for your entertainment.
41120	47620	And tonight for your entertainment, Tommy Tallarico is going to be here on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live very shortly.
47620	53760	But first, we're going to talk about some gaming news and I thought since we are going to be talking about music and video games,
53760	58400	how about some music news? Do you have some music game news for us, Loki, you could share?
58400	59500	Yes, I do actually.
59500	60000	Awesome.
60000	64500	There's some pretty interesting stuff we've been kind of hoping for this to actually happen.
64500	76000	But, apparently, a box shot of Samba de Amigo, a bundle with Meraka controller add-ons,
76000	76500	Yes.
76500	80900	has been seen at a UK retailer HMV's website.
80900	87200	Now, I hope they aren't the cheapy-crappy little plastic snap-on things like you've seen for Wii Golf and Wii Tennis, right?
87200	89500	Like, they need to make the shaky Meraka noise.
89500	90900	Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch when you use them.
90900	93400	It looks like that they have Meraka's on top of it.
93400	96300	I don't know if they make the shaky noise, but I don't see why they wouldn't.
96300	99700	If you're going to do Meraka controllers, do them right or don't do them at all, right?
99700	107500	And it's right now on there for 34.99 euros, which is about $70 US.
107500	114100	And we always like to read comments from Chat, the ever-present fourth guest on our show, at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, live on Sunday.
114100	117900	And J-Rod says simply, Meraka's equals win.
117900	120100	Meraka's do equal win.
120100	123100	What other games could be made better by Meraka's?
123100	124900	Dark Sakura, you think of anything?
124900	127500	Games that could be made better with Meraka's?
127500	128000	Yes.
128000	131900	Um, um...
131900	133700	Soul Calibur? I don't know.
133700	135200	Yes, Meraka Calibur!
135200	137600	Because, remember, I did Rod Calibur.
137600	138600	Yeah, you can do Rod Calibur on the Dreamcast.
138600	140000	Simple to do Meraka Calibur.
140000	140500	There you go.
140500	142300	I've got Meraka's controllers.
142300	144300	Me too, on Dreamcast, believe it or not.
144300	144800	For Dreamcast.
144800	147100	Let's try Meraka's Calibur.
147100	149900	Actually, any game can be played with the Meraka's.
149900	151100	Awesome.
151100	151600	If you think about it.
151600	153800	3rd Bullet suggests Gears of Meraka's.
153800	155500	Gears of Meraka's?
155500	158600	Miso suggests Cooking Mama is better with Meraka's.
158600	163800	The only thing that's kind of weird about the Meraka controller, though, I noticed,
163800	167600	is that, um, where's the infrared gonna come out?
167600	169600	Unless it goes all the way through the middle there.
169600	173300	Because it looks like the top's covered by the Meraka's.
173300	175100	Who knows? Who knows?
175100	180800	Well, one game that will not be made better by Meraka's is a game near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Launch Radio.
180800	182700	It's Beat Mania 2DX.
182700	185100	You know, this series has been around forever.
185100	185900	A long, long time.
185900	188000	Like, I remember when we first started this show.
188000	192400	Probably, like, Sick Style was the hot new thing that was out on the block, I think, when this show started.
192400	194100	I, I think so.
194100	199300	Believe it or not, this week was announced Beat Mania 2DX 16.
199300	202900	And, you know, ever since, uh, I wanna say Happy Sky or Red.
202900	203800	No, Red was the first one.
203800	206500	Ever since, uh, 11th Style or Red, if you will.
206500	208400	Uh, they've been given sub names.
208400	218200	And, uh, let's see, we had, what, 11 was Red, 12 was Happy Sky, 13 was, uh, Distorted, 14 was Gold, 15 was DJ Troopers.
218200	223400	Well, announced this week, Beat Mania 2DX 16 Empress.
223400	225500	That is incredibly gay looking.
225500	226200	Yes, it is.
226200	227000	Hey, wait a minute.
227000	228800	No, it, it really is.
228800	233600	Uh, it's a pink Sailor Moon looking logo, uh, 2DX 16 Empress.
233600	237200	There's a little butterfly hanging off the S, and it's pink.
237200	239200	It is very, very, very pink.
239200	243700	So, you go from the manliness of DJ Troopers to the not-so-manliness of Empress.
243700	244600	But, you know what?
244600	246900	I think the game might still be a lot of fun.
246900	252100	And, uh, there's already, uh, apparently some song names coming out from the test locations.
252100	259300	Apparently one song in Beat Mania 2DX 16 Empress, which, yes, is as pink as the, uh, little banner would have you thinking.
259300	260500	This is all over the internet.
260500	264000	Um, V2 is supposed to be in this game.
264000	266200	A sequel to V by Taka.
266200	268800	One of the most hoarded songs in Beat Mania 2DX history.
268800	272800	If you've ever walked by a Beat Mania or a DDR machine, you've probably read this one.
272800	276200	It actually is a V final from, um, that Taka album that came out.
276200	277700	Ahhh.
277700	278800	There you go.
278800	283600	So, Beat Mania 2DX Empress location testing right now, which means it'll probably be out in Japan in a couple of months.
283600	291200	And you'll probably see the home version in Japan only, sadly, early next year because, uh, they tried to release Beat Mania here.
291200	295800	And, unfortunately, it didn't do too well because people thought it was a Guitar Hero ripoff.
295800	301700	Shame on Konami for sitting on what could have been a gold mine for far, far, far too long.
301700	315000	Well, another potential, uh, gold mine, and this is one that was, uh, sent to us by the lovely and talented Sauce, is, uh, A Rumor of Guitar Hero Beatles Edition.
315000	317700	Which, actually, I think would be pretty cool.
317700	318300	Um...
318300	320800	That would be kinda neat.
320800	325000	I think that more of the young whippersnappers need to hear some Beatles music.
325000	338300	Well, um, the, uh, Sony, um, ATV CEO, uh, Marty Bond, is it Bondier or Bondier, I guess, um, said that what they, they've actually talked about putting Beatles songs in a Guitar Hero game.
338300	341900	And something that you'd like to pursue, and that's a quote.
341900	343200	So...
343200	344600	Maybe...
344600	346000	It could happen?
346000	350000	Wouldn't that be weird if Beatles were in Guitar Hero before they were on iTunes?
350000	351000	Because, you know, that's, like, the big, uh, the big thing.
351000	353000	They never can be on iTunes, I think.
353000	356300	I know, because of the whole Apple thing, but it's just kind of interesting, you know?
356300	359100	Like, eh, what's taking them so long to get on iTunes?
359100	360900	But, there you go.
360900	363800	And big, differing opinions in the chat room.
363800	366100	ThirdBullet says, I hate the Beatles.
366100	367100	Uh, Misty says, Beatles...
367100	368900	You're getting booted from the chat room.
368900	371200	Misty says, Beatles, fuck yeah.
371200	374000	Watch me do it.
374000	376100	This is not a democracy here at O.L.R.
376100	378700	This is a jameocracy.
378700	379800	Who is it, ThirdBullet?
379800	380700	I...
380700	382500	You don't have to ram.
382500	383500	Alright.
383500	384500	Jameocracy?
384500	385500	Jameocracy?
385500	386500	Jameocracy.
386500	387500	Yeah.
387500	388500	Revolution!
388500	389500	Off with her head!
389500	391500	I'm just kidding.
391500	392500	Alright.
392500	393500	Well, um...
393500	395500	I don't know if we're gonna...
395500	400200	Well, we'll probably be getting this before we'll see Beatles on any, uh, sort of system
400200	406600	for it, but, uh, Rockband is getting, um, I guess some tracks from Crewfest, which is
406600	410000	the, uh, Motley Crue tour, I guess.
410000	415100	And, um, they've got a few tracks on here, including a free one.
415100	420800	Um, part of the Crewfest pack, which is gonna be 240 Microsoft points, or $3, you've got
420800	423300	Down at the Whiskey by Motley Crue.
423300	426700	Um, you've got Time is Running Out by Papa Roach.
426700	430660	Uh, Who's Going Home with You Tonight by Trapped.
430660	438180	And also, uh, the free track, Promised Land by, um, looks like Vesuvius, I guess.
438180	442660	And that's supposedly coming from the new movie, The Rocker, which, uh, stars, uh, the
442660	445700	guy from, uh, The Office who plays Dwight.
445700	450300	Yes, I've seen those ads all over MySpace, and frankly, I'm sick of them.
450300	451580	Hey, free track!
451580	452580	It sucks!
452580	453580	Who cares?
453580	456020	Free track is free, so, uh, hey, why not?
456020	457720	It's worth checking out.
457720	459020	Do you think, uh, free track's worth...
459020	463700	I mean, it's not like it's the Yaris theme song, so it can't be all bad, right?
463700	464700	Let's hope.
464700	465700	Alright.
465700	470620	Well, that's gonna do it for some of our video game news, uh, music edition for right now,
470620	471620	but hey, you know what?
471620	474900	Earlier this week, we had the fortune to speak with Tommy Tallarico.
474900	478420	You might remember him from his appearances on G4's Judgment Day, or you probably heard
478420	481100	his music in games like Earthworm Jim, Advent Rising.
481100	485580	Well, now Tommy is best known for his work with the Video Games Live concert series.
485580	489820	Recently, Video Games Live announced an expansive world tour, so we reached out to Tommy to
489820	493940	come on the show to talk about the upcoming tour, as well as respond to some of the recent
493940	496580	emails we've gotten about Video Games Live.
496580	498820	So let's head on over to the Skype line.
498820	501380	Alright, hey, Tommy, are you there?
501380	502660	Yo, I am here!
502660	505900	Hey, Tommy Tallarico, how are you doing this fine evening?
505900	508600	I'm doing great, working as always.
508600	513040	You must be a very, very busy man traveling to all these new places on the Video Games
513040	514040	Live tour.
514040	515540	Do you actually go to all the shows yourself?
515540	522060	Oh, yeah, every single show, aside from, uh, creating and, uh, producing the show every
522060	526580	night we also, um, I also host the show and even play guitar with the symphony towards
526580	527580	the end.
527580	531700	So you've got to be pretty exhausted, because not only are you balancing Video Games Live,
531700	534500	but Video Games Live isn't the only thing you do, either, so...
534500	539540	Yeah, yeah, I mean, aside from my, you know, still working on a few game, smaller game
539540	545180	projects here and there, because VGL definitely takes up most of, uh, 95% of my time, but,
545180	552140	uh, working on a couple DS and Wii and PC products, as well as also the, uh, the Chairman
552140	555540	of the, um, the Game Audio Network Guild.
555540	556540	Excellent.
556540	559460	I definitely want to ask you about the Game Audio Network Guild, but I know the listeners
559460	562540	want to hear about Video Games Live, absolutely, because we've gotten, you know, emails and
562540	563620	calls about it.
563620	565580	Let me ask you this about Video Games Live.
565580	571460	You're going to so many new places on this, you know, 50-date city tour you just announced.
571460	575300	What can someone who has never been to Video Games Live before expect to experience?
575300	581140	Yeah, well, Video Games Live is all the greatest video game music of all time, played by a
581140	587300	full symphony and choir, but what makes it really unique is that everyb- everything is
587300	594340	completely synchronized with, uh, video and rock and roll lighting and special effects
594340	600540	and interactivity with the crowd and stage show production and we have a whole pre-show
600540	607420	festival with gaming competitions and prize giveaways and costume contests and a post-show
607420	611300	meet and greet, which is open for everyone with peo- different people in the industry
611300	614320	and famous composers and designers and things like that.
614320	619460	So it really is a complete celebration of the entire video game industry.
619460	624180	In fact, I kind of like to describe it as all of the power and emotion of a symphony
624180	630620	orchestra combined with the excitement and energy of a rock concert mixed together with
630620	637780	all of the cutting edge visuals, technology, interactivity, and fun that video games provide.
637780	641060	It's kind of like, the way you describe it, it's almost like a traveling convention of
641060	642060	sorts.
642060	643900	There's so much to see at these shows.
643900	647940	Yeah, I mean, we really wanted to create an event, you know?
647940	650300	We didn't want to create, you know, we wanted to create a show.
650300	655900	We didn't want to just create a concert or, you know, oh yeah, here's a bunch of classical
655900	659460	people in tuxedos up on a stage playing video game music.
659460	664180	I mean, you know, and that's great as well, but, you know, people have been doing that,
664180	668980	they've been doing that in Japan for almost 20 years now, so, you know, we wanted to do
668980	675020	something completely new, completely unique, and really, our goal from the beginning was
675020	679540	to create this show for the non-gamer as well.
679540	686160	You know, we wanted to create something that was, had mass appeal, and that you don't have
686160	691040	to know a darn thing at all about video games in order to come to the show and really be
691040	698140	blown away and entertained, and that's why Video Games Live has grown, you know, so quickly
698140	700300	and as big as it has.
700300	708100	We did three shows in 2005, 11 shows in 2006, 29 last year in 2007.
708100	713320	This year we have over 50 shows, next year we have over 80 shows, and the goal is to
713320	718540	build it by 2010 up to 100 and to 120 shows a year.
718540	726100	So yeah, you know, so by having all these visuals, by creating a performance and a production
726100	734660	and an event and a show, it clearly crosses over and has much more mass appeal than just,
734660	742380	you know, a hardcore gaming concert that, you know, that all the Final Fantasy fans
742380	746100	go to or all the, you know, whatever particular items.
746100	750940	We want to appeal to everybody, whether you're into video games or not, and again, that's
750940	756480	not to downplay what all of the amazing concerts in the past have done and continue to do,
756480	758700	but ours is a little different.
758700	761500	Let me go off of that a little bit because you talk about making this concert accessible
761500	765220	to even those that are non-gamers, and I know we have a lot of listeners that are a little
765220	769500	bit younger, 15, 16, 17, it's a little harder for them to just kind of get up and go get
769500	770500	a concert ticket.
770500	775260	What would you say would be the best way to sell a night at Video Games Live to my parents?
775260	776740	Yeah, oh, absolutely.
776740	782040	Well, I mean, of course there's a website, videogameslive.com, and we have a bunch of
782040	788460	trailers on there, and you'll see parents in their 40s and 50s, you'll see grandmas
788460	796620	in their 60s and 70s, you'll see little girls, 7, 8, 9 years old, all saying, oh my gosh,
796620	801980	this was the greatest night of my life, you know, oh my gosh, I've never seen a show quite
801980	804820	like this before, I was really blown away.
804820	810880	I came here because, you know, I was dragged here by my boyfriend or the grandmother saying
810880	816060	I was taking my grandson to the symphony for the first time, and those are the people most
816060	822660	blown away by the production because they're astonished at the quality of music.
822660	827180	You know, again, the reason why I created this in the beginning was to prove to the
827180	834020	world how culturally significant and artistic video games, and of course their music, have
834020	835020	become.
835020	840020	And so the best letters and emails that we get after a performance, they come pouring
840020	844460	in, they're all from non-gamers, they're all from the people who are blown away going,
844460	849620	oh my gosh, I never knew that video games were this incredible and the music was so
849620	855780	powerful and the characters and the storylines were so interesting and intense and the graphics
855780	864060	are so beautiful, I get it now, now I understand why my kids are so much into video games.
864060	865780	Thank you for opening my eyes.
865780	871540	So a lot of times, you know, on the website, we'll put in these comments and we'll put
871540	876060	in, we show all of the reviews that we've gotten for the show and all of the comments
876060	881220	and letters from people and non-gamers, and in those reviews, they all kind of follow
881220	884580	the same thing going, well, you know what, I wasn't into video games, I didn't know what
884580	886900	to expect, but wow, you know.
886900	891780	So it's word of mouth that really is the, I kind of compare us a little bit in that
891780	897180	respect to Cirque du Soleil, in that, you know, the first time people had heard of Cirque
897180	900540	du Soleil, I know I was one of them, I was kind of like, what the hell is it?
900540	904380	Is it circus animals running around, clowns?
904380	905380	I don't get it.
905380	909740	You know, it was only until you saw it with your own two eyes or somebody really close
909740	915020	to you explained it in great detail where you start to go, oh, I get it, you know.
915020	920100	So I mean, yeah, you could watch the 1,500 plus YouTube videos that are on there right
920100	921100	now.
921100	925060	You do a search for video games live and they'll all come up, but, you know, a lot of people
925060	929300	always tell us, you know, I watched all the YouTube videos, but until you're there, until
929300	936540	you're experiencing that magic of being in a room with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 people all
936540	940940	experiencing it at once, there's, you know, there's some magic that it goes on, you know.
940940	943940	YouTube is never a substitution for anything like this.
943940	944940	Absolutely.
944940	949060	Well, whatever you guys are doing, however the word is getting out there, obviously it's
949060	950060	working.
950060	954820	Video games live, it's coming up on a three-year anniversary pretty soon, if I'm not mistaken.
954820	959260	But based on what you're saying, you know, ramping up to 120 shows in 2010, it's not
959260	960860	slowing down anytime soon.
960860	964540	What would you say, Tommy, is the biggest accomplishment, the biggest thing you've accomplished
964540	967780	from video games live in its three-year history so far?
967780	978180	Well, you know, I think that I had a dream, myself and my fellow video game composer Jack
978180	983000	Wall who also conducts video games live and we kind of, you know, created the show together.
983000	989520	It took us three years to create the show and in the beginning, we started this in 2002
989520	994640	and everyone thought we were completely insane and completely crazy.
994640	1004940	So I would say that our biggest accomplishment is, you know, is getting this thing up and
1004940	1009860	running to the point where, you know, I mean, I could point to certain singular things that
1009860	1015580	happened like, for example, our first show ever was at the Hollywood Bowl on July 6,
1015580	1018100	2005 with the L.A. Phil.
1018100	1022700	Over 11,000 people showed up to that show.
1022700	1025960	People thought, you know, two or three thousand people were going to show up or whatever.
1025960	1033980	So I mean, you know, I mean, what an accomplishment to say that we, our first show ever with that
1033980	1039780	quite arguably the most famous stage in the entire planet, you know?
1039780	1040780	And there's other things.
1040780	1044500	I mean, you know, we were the first to play in Canada, the first American concert to play
1044500	1051540	in Asia, the first to play in Brazil and places like Spain and London, England and, you know,
1051540	1053540	I mean, there's New Zealand, things like that.
1053540	1059300	I mean, I could point to a lot of those things, but I just think the idea that this is, you
1059300	1064420	know, surviving and growing at the rate it is, I think when everyone in the beginning
1064420	1069200	told us we were insane and crazy and it would never work, you know, that's the greatest
1069200	1070780	accomplishment for us.
1070780	1074700	And kind of building on that, because you talk, you've talked about all these places
1074700	1079980	you've been and that you're the kind of the first video game concert in Canada and the
1079980	1082780	first concert in Asia and things kind of keep growing.
1082780	1086740	I mean, through these latest tour dates, you guys are going to Germany, China, Thailand,
1086740	1087740	Portugal.
1087740	1090100	I mean, your passport is probably very impressive.
1090100	1094700	I got to wonder, how do you select the places that you're going to go?
1094700	1098660	How do you decide we're going to do this in Asia or we're going to go to Portugal?
1098660	1100760	How do you pick where you're going?
1100760	1101760	That's a great question.
1101760	1104460	A number of different ways, actually.
1104460	1112020	We've now grown to a point where people are now, you know, knocking our doors down trying
1112020	1113020	to get us.
1113020	1122420	So, you know, the people in China contacted us and we're going to do, we're doing Beijing
1122420	1124300	and Hong Kong, multiple dates.
1124300	1128260	You know, the people from Singapore contacted us, you know.
1128260	1129260	It's a great thing.
1129260	1133200	In terms of all the places in the United States, you know, we had a really important show at
1133200	1139420	the end of April where it was our debut on Broadway in New York City, you know, and a
1139420	1143460	very important thing for any act or performance.
1143460	1146460	And we sold out the show three months in advance.
1146460	1148740	And so that was a huge accomplishment.
1148740	1155060	What that does is that sends messages to all of the other promoters and cities and symphonies
1155060	1157580	and buyers of this material.
1157580	1159380	It sends out a strong message.
1159380	1161380	And so they start knocking down our doors.
1161380	1167120	So at this point for us, all we're trying to do is, you know, kind of take all of these
1167120	1172100	things and put them in at some kind, make some kind of sensible routing or sensible
1172100	1176540	order and, you know, figuring out, okay, which ones do we pick?
1176540	1182380	Like for example, if the San Diego Symphony contacts us, oh, hey, let's do it during Comic-Con
1182380	1183580	in San Diego.
1183580	1188380	You know, the German promoters contact us, well, geez, let's do it during Leipzig Game
1188380	1189380	Convention.
1189380	1191780	Indianapolis Symphony, let's do it during Gen Con.
1191780	1198020	So we always try to, you know, work in maybe around some kind of conference.
1198020	1200620	But I'll tell you an interesting story, though.
1200620	1205860	I got an email from a 17-year-old girl in Taipei, Taiwan.
1205860	1214380	And she wrote me and said, hey, I would like to get a petition going to bring video games
1214380	1215380	live to Taiwan.
1215380	1219580	It would be the very first video game concert ever in Taiwan.
1219580	1225500	And she asked if she could use our logo and things to start a petition.
1225500	1227860	And she wanted to make up flyers and pass them on.
1227860	1228860	I said, sure, absolutely.
1228860	1233820	And I thought it was kind of cool and adorable, you know.
1233820	1242940	But two weeks later, she contacts me, and she has an Excel spreadsheet and a link that
1242940	1244480	I could follow.
1244480	1247360	And she says, hey, look, been working really hard.
1247360	1253340	We have over 2800 people who have signed up, signed the petition.
1253340	1255300	Here's all their email addresses.
1255300	1258180	Here's the link and all the comments that they've left back.
1258180	1263360	And I'm like, how the heck do people know about video games live in Taiwan?
1263360	1265160	And she says, oh, through YouTube.
1265160	1267100	We all get together and watch it.
1267100	1272580	It's kind of this underground community thing where they check your show dates.
1272580	1277380	And then the day after the show, people watch all the videos that people post on YouTube.
1277380	1280020	And they feel like they're part of the event.
1280020	1285060	So I pass this information on to one of our booking agents in Asia.
1285060	1287900	And within two weeks, we got a big promoter.
1287900	1291740	Because of this girl, we were doing two shows in Taipei now.
1291740	1296820	That's the cool thing about video games, though, if you think about it, and video game music
1296820	1303660	specifically, is that you could go, and we've hopefully proven this, you can go anywhere
1303660	1305260	in the world.
1305260	1307820	And video games are popular.
1307820	1308820	You know?
1308820	1310220	I mean, think about that for a second.
1310220	1314580	There's not a lot of music out there that you can say the same thing.
1314580	1319460	Like, for example, the Dave Matthews bands might be super popular in America.
1319460	1322840	They might sell out 20,000 seat stadiums.
1322840	1326060	But when they go to Germany, maybe not so much.
1326060	1328940	Or when they go to Spain, no one knows who they are.
1328940	1331620	Or Korea, no one's heard of them, right?
1331620	1333220	And the reverse is true.
1333220	1336980	European bands try to break you here all the time, and people have no idea who they are.
1336980	1338300	They just never really catch on.
1338300	1339300	Exactly.
1339300	1341340	And the same with Japan as well.
1341340	1344020	Whereas video games, music.
1344020	1345540	What a universal thing.
1345540	1353300	Now, although the game popularity might change from region to region, like in the US here,
1353300	1357140	we might play Halo as our big grand finale.
1357140	1362500	But maybe down in Brazil, where the PlayStation is a lot more predominant, and not so many
1362500	1368780	Xboxes, maybe a game like Castlevania or Nintendo is big down there as well.
1368780	1372780	So maybe it's Mario or Castlevania down in Brazil, you know?
1372780	1378100	And so it's really been a learning experience and an eye-opener for me.
1378100	1380820	To take Brazil, for example, is a great example.
1380820	1381820	We went down there.
1381820	1383940	We had three weeks of sold-out shows.
1383940	1388620	Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and Brasília, which is the capital.
1388620	1394260	And they, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people a night, screaming at the top of their lungs, you know,
1394260	1399900	so much so that our front-of-house mixer couldn't even hear the symphony when he was trying
1399900	1400900	to mix it.
1400900	1402100	It's like, I hope this sounds good.
1402100	1406620	I mean, the passion down there for stuff like this is off the charts.
1406620	1409900	But you never hear about gamers in Brazil over here.
1409900	1410900	Why?
1410900	1416040	Because, and you never see Brazil at the top of any, you know, marketing lists or lists
1416040	1419700	about how many gamers there are in Brazil and this and that.
1419700	1420700	Why?
1420700	1422240	Because it's all black market down there.
1422240	1427700	You know, 99% of all the games that are sold, companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft
1427700	1434980	and EA and Activision, they don't even distribute games down there because it's all, or hardware,
1434980	1436860	because it's all black market.
1436860	1442220	But because it's so easily accessible and because it's so cheap, there's more hardcore
1442220	1448880	gamers down there than I've seen and experienced in other parts of the world, you know.
1448880	1453940	And even, like, down in Mexico, we played a smaller town in Mexico a couple months ago.
1453940	1456580	It was at the end of March.
1456580	1460820	We played a 7,000 seat bull ring in Mexico, Mexicali, Mexico.
1460820	1466420	It wasn't Mexico City, which is the biggest city in the world, which people may not, 30
1466420	1468620	million people.
1468620	1469620	And same with Brazil.
1469620	1470700	We play Sao Paulo.
1470700	1475460	It's the second or third biggest city in the world, like 28 million people.
1475460	1481220	But even in a smaller town like Mexicali, Mexico, which I think has a million people,
1481220	1484980	you know, there were 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 gamers who showed up.
1484980	1486860	You know, it's funny, Tommy.
1486860	1491740	One of those people that were there at that concert in Mexicali actually called us that
1491740	1492740	next weekend.
1492740	1493740	Oh, really?
1493740	1494740	Yes.
1494740	1497180	He's one of our listeners at Deft and he said he had a great time at the show, can't wait
1497180	1498260	to go back.
1498260	1502260	And that was kind of leading to my next question, which I think you might have already answered,
1502260	1504740	talking about the girl from Taipei.
1504740	1508260	But if there's somebody who wants this event to come to their city or come back to their
1508260	1512220	city, what do you think is the best way for them to kind of go about doing this?
1512220	1515500	I mean, I don't know if you want to get a partition from every city, but what do you
1515500	1519220	think would be the best way for somebody to get this back to their town?
1519220	1524100	We actually put this in the FAQ on our website as well because we get asked that same question
1524100	1526900	by so many people.
1526900	1531980	And the other question that's asked a lot is, how do you pick which music to play for
1531980	1534540	different cities or countries that you go to?
1534540	1538360	So it's really a two-part answer.
1538360	1544500	The first question is, we have a mailing list on the front page, it's Video Games Live mailing
1544500	1545500	list.
1545500	1551020	We don't spam people, we send out something maybe once every couple of months, or if it's
1551020	1556260	coming to your area, we'll geo-target your area to let you know that pre-sale tickets
1556260	1562340	are going on so that Video Games Live folks can get them before the general public does.
1562340	1567420	But on that, there's a thing that says, let us know what games you want to hear.
1567420	1573020	And what we do is we take that list and it spits out an Excel spreadsheet for us for
1573020	1574140	that area.
1574140	1580040	So I can geo-target a 200-mile radius around the city that we're going to, and it will
1580040	1584500	show me, out of all the people who signed up for the mailing list, what they want to
1584500	1585500	hear most.
1585500	1590780	So each show we do, we have our standards, if you will.
1590780	1595980	Every show, we're going to play your Final Fantasy and Halo and Warcraft and Mario and
1595980	1600660	Zelda and Kingdom Hearts and Sonic and all that stuff.
1600660	1604880	There's certain games we like to play every single show, although we change them from
1604880	1607100	year to year.
1607100	1613180	But then when you start to replay about 20 segments in an evening, that constitutes about
1613180	1615560	a two-and-a-half hour presentation.
1615560	1624660	So one night, if we're in France, for example, and the game Beyond Good and Evil was created
1624660	1630620	by my good friend Michel Ancel at Ubisoft in France, we're going to play Beyond Good
1630620	1631620	and Evil.
1631620	1636100	And in fact, or we'll play it like we played in Montreal in February, because that's the
1636100	1638980	North American home office of Ubisoft.
1638980	1644660	We played Ubisoft games and had some of the creators there.
1644660	1649500	It will last, this past weekend we were in Las Vegas, so we did the world premiere of
1649500	1653180	Command and Conquer, because the game was made right there.
1653180	1663420	So, yeah, we have, in Asia, stuff like Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 2 hasn't even come out, but
1663420	1667180	we're already playing the music and the video.
1667180	1673660	Games like Warcraft and Starcraft are super huge over in Asia, but not so much down in
1673660	1680340	Brazil because a lot of people are less about PC gaming and more about Nintendo and Sony.
1680340	1685580	So down in Brazil, stuff like Metroid and Castlevania is huge down there.
1685580	1693660	So we vary, but we really listen to the fans from that area to decide, and if people want
1693660	1700260	to bring our show to their city, we also have an email address, info at video games live
1700260	1707060	dot com, and we collect all those emails and normally someone will get back to you within
1707060	1708060	24 hours.
1708060	1712460	Excellent, I hope not only act deaf, but all of our listeners who are hoping to get video
1712460	1716500	games live in their backyard are successful with that.
1716500	1719140	Speaking of listeners going to the show, I have to bring this up.
1719140	1722540	This might be a little silly, but I got to ask it, it's kind of funny.
1722540	1726180	One of our listeners, DJ Jenai, wrote us on a previous show and he was talking about the
1726180	1730900	video games live tour stop in Las Vegas, raved about the show, said he had a great time,
1730900	1734660	but one part that kind of cracked me up is he specifically mentioned that you change
1734660	1736940	outfits quite a bit during the show.
1736940	1740380	Are you coordinating your wardrobe to match the games?
1740380	1745620	I'll tell you exactly, and I'll explain it, and again it's a great question.
1745620	1751180	I'm Cher up in this motherfucker, no, I'm like Cher, I got to change everything, Madonna,
1751180	1758220	Britney, no, there's three times, I have two and a half hour performance, I host the show
1758220	1765220	of course, as I mentioned, and I want to be respectful to the symphony and the people
1765220	1770340	on stage, but by the same token I'm also, you know, I've been a video game composer
1770340	1776560	for 18 years, so I might come out in an Armani suit, but I might be wearing, you know, Nike
1776560	1780420	sneakers and a Spiderman shirt underneath, or a Mickey Mouse shirt underneath, or whatever,
1780420	1790420	so I don't know what you'd call it, casual, whatever, I don't know, casual talks or something,
1790420	1791420	I don't know.
1791420	1796740	But at the beginning I, you know, kind of do that, and then we have a 20 minute intermission,
1796740	1805300	and I come back and now the shirt's on buttons, the, you know, the coat tails might be off,
1805300	1812500	we're going to turn on the lights a little bit for this segment, and then at the end
1812500	1817500	I come out with a guitar, and it would look silly of me to be wearing a suit and playing
1817500	1824380	guitar, so by the encore I'm kind of in, you know, a little bit more rock and roll gear,
1824380	1830180	if you will, and so yeah, so I changed three times, once at the beginning to be kind of
1830180	1833460	more formal, and then it kind of evolves into not so formal.
1833460	1837260	Alright, well that makes sense, thank you for helping to explain that, alright, it was
1837260	1839260	a very important question about Video Games Live.
1839260	1840260	No worries, no worries.
1840260	1844260	Alright, no, this really is an important question about Video Games Live, a lot of people are
1844260	1849100	wondering, is there a CD at some point in the future, or some type of digital distribution,
1849100	1851220	iTunes, question mark?
1851220	1858060	Absolutely, in fact it's something that was supposed to come out last fall, and then we
1858060	1862500	held, we kind of, the record company made the decision that they didn't want it to come
1862500	1867940	out during Christmas, because, you know, Christmas season, because they didn't want it to get
1867940	1872260	lost and all the, you know, the great games that always come out around that time, so
1872260	1877700	then we, we're going to delay it to the first quarter of this year, you know, we're thinking,
1877700	1883500	oh, maybe come out like around, you know, February or March instead, after all the Christmas
1883500	1890340	hype had subsided, but then we're working on some new great pieces, at the time I was
1890340	1895500	working on, because a lot of people also, they email us to say, or they'll all talk
1895500	1899240	to people after the show during the meet and greet, and I always ask, hey, how can we improve
1899240	1904260	the show, is there something that you want to hear that we don't play in the show, and
1904260	1910260	I was getting just bombarded by like, you know, Metroid and Castlevania, which we hadn't,
1910260	1914300	you know, we had done an orchestral version of Castlevania, but I was never happy with
1914300	1919740	it, because I think, you know, Castlevania music needs to really be like a combination
1919740	1924100	of symphony and rock and roll, that's how I wanted to present it in my mind, and so
1924100	1930380	I was working on this Castlevania thing, and I was just like, man, I really want to, I
1930380	1939300	want to get this on the album, so I asked, you know, I asked EMI, who's one of the biggest
1939300	1943180	record companies in the world who's putting the album out, you know, I kind of begged
1943180	1947940	and pleaded to say, hey, could we, you know, could we delay this again and add a couple
1947940	1952980	more tracks to the album that I think will be really special to gamers, you know, including
1952980	1959020	this, you know, this Castlevania piece, and they said, yeah, no problem, sure, you know,
1959020	1965220	so the album is officially going to be released in physical form around the world, too, not
1965220	1971140	just in America, not just on iTunes, I'm talking about all over Europe, all over Asia, it's
1971140	1978580	the first time ever that a video game compilation album is being released by a major record
1978580	1984020	company around the world, it's never happened before, and the licensing, if you can imagine
1984020	1990820	the licensing, you know, going through companies like Halo, I mean, Microsoft for Halo, and
1990820	1996220	Ubisoft for Myst, and, you know, Konami for Castlevania, I mean, it got to be, you know,
1996220	2001040	it was a bit of a nightmare at first, because no one had ever really done anything like
2001040	2005500	this before, same thing we encountered, that's why it took us three years to get the first
2005500	2009300	concert in order, because no one had ever done it to the scale and size that we were
2009300	2015580	doing, but, so, it's going to be released all over the world, July 22nd is the release
2015580	2021380	date here in America, which we're coinciding, and another reason we wanted to delay it is
2021380	2028560	because we wanted to, we wanted to launch it at a special, for different special events,
2028560	2033620	so for example, the reason it's being released in July, that's the week of Comic Con, and
2033620	2040060	we're opening Comic Con with the San Diego Symphony, right there on the grounds of Comic
2040060	2046260	Con, right next, at the Embarcadero, on the water, outside shows, San Diego Symphony,
2046260	2052540	so many special guests, but we're also having synchronized fireworks as well for that show,
2052540	2058100	and so this is all in celebration as well of our album being released that week, so
2058100	2061900	we wanted to wait for something big, and that was the one.
2061900	2068220	In terms of our European release, we're going to do that, we're playing a 7,000 seat stadium
2068220	2074700	in Leipzig, it's the Leipzig Arena, right there during the Games Convention in August,
2074700	2079380	so we're going to wait to release the album in August in Europe, you know, have it be
2079380	2085140	around a big press and marketing event and things like that, and then in Asia, we're
2085140	2088500	going to be releasing it right around the time of the Olympics, where we're playing
2088500	2092980	in Taipei in the beginning of August, and that's when we're going to do the big release
2092980	2099860	there, the very first video game concert ever in those countries, China and Taiwan, so,
2099860	2106700	but that being said, it's also going to be available for download on iTunes before the
2106700	2113320	physical release comes out, and it's also going to have special content and special
2113320	2120960	songs that are not on the physical CD as a kind of a special bonus.
2120960	2125820	Very cool, and you know, we here at OLR, I think we can all agree we're very comfortable
2125820	2130820	with you delaying the CD to incorporate Castlevania, because that game is incredible, and the music
2130820	2133740	is awesome, so we're fine.
2133740	2141180	It's like when Miyamoto, I worked with Miyamoto on Metroid Prime, and I've known him for many
2141180	2148240	years, he's such a great guy, and he once told me, you know, when I said, well how do
2148240	2153620	you know when the game is done, you know, like do you have a schedule, he says, you
2153620	2162400	know, the game is released when I'm finished with it, you know, and that's why Halo 2 gets
2162400	2168140	delayed a couple years, Zelda gets delayed a couple years, Half Life 2 comes out two
2168140	2174520	years, three years later, whatever it is, but you know what, don't you wish all game
2174520	2179960	companies and game makers and game developers had that same sense about it.
2179960	2186840	Why is Halo Halo, and Half Life Half Life, and why any Miyamoto product is what it is,
2186840	2193980	it's because they refuse to let anything out that's not perfect, you know, or the best
2193980	2195900	it could possibly be at that time.
2195900	2200360	We feel the same way, we don't want to just rush out an album, we were making Castlevania,
2200360	2206440	it's like, man, I gotta get this on, it's a really popular track that we love to perform.
2206440	2210200	And you're absolutely right, in gaming, you know, a lot of people get very frustrated
2210200	2213600	with these delays sometimes, but you know what, sometimes it's for a good reason.
2213600	2217040	So you know the funny thing about that too is that you'll notice like people will bitch
2217040	2222920	and moan like crazy when it keeps getting delayed, and then the second those games come
2222920	2226760	out, I worked on Metroid Prime, I think we were working on it for five freaking years
2226760	2230560	or something, with Miyamoto, right?
2230560	2236200	But the thing you'll notice though is when the game comes out, and it's freaking perfect,
2236200	2239400	you never hear any complaints ever again about it being delayed, right?
2239400	2244560	It's very true, everybody seems to forget, everyone seems to forget the second the day
2244560	2245560	comes out.
2245560	2249400	Well Tommy, I know it might be a little late for requests for Video Games Live CD Volume
2249400	2254280	1, but seeing as this thing's going into 2010, I think a Volume 2 is going to be an inevitability
2254280	2255280	at some point.
2255280	2257740	A Silent Hill, keep that in mind.
2257740	2259680	We love Silent Hill here at OLR.
2259680	2267280	Akira is a very good friend of mine, he's joined us on stage a few times, most recently
2267280	2274360	in Los Angeles last year during the E4ALL Expo, and we did a big show there, 5,000 people
2274360	2284760	where we opened the Nokia, it's called, LA Live is the area, but the Nokia Center.
2284760	2289720	I remember that Tommy, I was in LA, and I wanted to go to the show, I was stuck doing
2289720	2290720	work, I couldn't do it.
2290720	2292480	I was so mad.
2292480	2297160	Well you could have met Akira right there, if you like Silent Hill, he was part of our
2297160	2298420	meet and greet as well.
2298420	2303680	Not only Akira, I had him on stage, I also had the creator of Dance Dance Revolution,
2303680	2310360	and also the dude who created Castlevania as well, Iga, was also part of the meet and
2310360	2311400	greet there as well.
2311400	2316560	But yes, Silent Hill, get a little, what do you think, in Laura's theme?
2316560	2320400	Maybe just the theme from the very first game, that really haunting little melody in the
2320400	2325320	beginning, and the kind of like, upbeat as it goes through, just the classic, or, I don't
2325320	2329220	know, I'm kind of partial to the soundtrack for Silent Hill 4, I don't know what my co-host
2329220	2332160	would say about that, I think they're all about Silent Hill 2, but...
2332160	2338880	You know the tough part, it's something to think about too, from my end, is that, like
2338880	2344740	the music from Silent Hill is a perfect example, where certain games, it's very hard to translate
2344740	2349960	to a live performance, especially when you're talking about a symphony on stage, Silent
2349960	2352000	Hill is one of those games, you know?
2352000	2355920	I'll tell you, the other game that was very, very challenging, and I didn't want to put
2355920	2360040	it in the show until I figured it out, was Metroid, right?
2360040	2364480	Because everyone loves Metroid, and we were getting so many requests for it, but it's
2364480	2368720	like, how do you do Metroid with a symphony, you know?
2368720	2373560	And so what we, I mean I don't want to spoil it, but people can check it out on YouTube
2373560	2379500	or whatever anyway, but what we did with Metroid is we decided to, let's try to create that
2379500	2384880	beginning, that everyone knows and loves so much, let's try to kind of recreate those
2384880	2392840	electronics and bleeps and bloops with the symphony, you know, and add in the electronics,
2392840	2398100	add in the original sounds from the game, and play those live with the symphony as well,
2398100	2403360	to kind of give it this really super-duper retro feel, because if you try to just do
2403360	2408960	it with instruments, it sometimes doesn't translate, you know, so we're really happy
2408960	2414240	with the way the Metroid segment turned out, and it's been a really popular segment for
2414240	2415240	us.
2415240	2416240	Excellent.
2416240	2417240	Excellent.
2417240	2420960	I can't wait to see it myself, hopefully in San Jose.
2420960	2424840	One thing, I want to kind of ask you about some of the other stuff outside of Video Games
2424840	2427920	Live, I know we're kind of longer than we anticipated in the beginning, that's alright,
2427920	2430400	we're having a good time, I wanted to ask you about some of your other stuff besides
2430400	2433480	just Video Games Live, let me take another listener question here.
2433480	2437720	One of our listeners, Dark Tetsuya, wanted to know, do you have a favorite piece that
2437720	2440760	you've ever worked on for the video game music that you've composed?
2440760	2442040	Sure, yeah.
2442040	2445320	There's actually two, I'm going to go with two, actually.
2445320	2453920	The stuff that I did for Earthworm Jim is some of my favorite stuff, and more so, not
2453920	2460800	necessarily even from a composing standpoint, but from a, just a silliness standpoint in
2460800	2466080	terms of like, when we were working on Earthworm Jim, there was like ten guys in a room, all
2466080	2468040	trying to make each other laugh.
2468040	2472960	That was Video, or that was Earthworm Jim, that's what we did, we had a year to make
2472960	2473960	each other laugh.
2473960	2477080	And you totally can't tell from the way it turned out.
2477080	2478960	Yeah, right?
2478960	2484920	And so, you know, that was such a great experience, and just doing it so, so differently, of course
2484920	2490000	that team had been together for a long time, we worked on the original Terminator game,
2490000	2494760	we did Global Gladiators for the Genesis, then we did Cool Spot, then we did Disney's
2494760	2499680	Aladdin, and then we did Earthworm Jim 1 and 2, and then MDK after that, before everyone
2499680	2505760	kind of started their own companies, but that was such a great experience, so I would say
2505760	2510320	if I had a personal favorite, that would be it.
2510320	2517980	But in terms of composition, though, I feel as a composer that the favorite stuff that
2517980	2523600	I've composed is probably Advent Rising, and some of the music in there, because I've always
2523600	2529100	wanted to write like an Italian opera, and so when Advent Rising came across, and it's
2529100	2538400	too bad that the game didn't do well at all, and it's a shame, but I was really happy with
2538400	2542560	the way the music composition turned out in that, and it was something I've always wanted
2542560	2547000	to do my whole life, and so I really put my heart and soul into that score.
2547000	2549960	Well, hopefully people will get a second chance to check that out if it ever makes its way
2549960	2550960	to the Xbox originals.
2550960	2551960	Yeah, there you go.
2551960	2556400	All right, well, one other thing I want to ask you about, we mentioned kind of towards
2556400	2559780	the beginning of the interview, you also, you know, not just do this Video Games Live,
2559780	2564720	you also are the chairman of Game Audio Network Guild, or GANG, it's like a network of people
2564720	2569520	basically involved with gaming music, voiceovers, sound designers, what's GANG up to this year?
2569520	2570520	What is GANG doing this year?
2570520	2577440	Well, the biggest thing, the biggest thing that GANG has just done, last week in fact,
2577440	2586280	was launch version 3.0 of our website, which is a complete networking mass, I mean it really,
2586280	2592360	you know, the third word in GANG, network, right, the Game Audio Network Guild, this
2592360	2597000	was always our dream to have this kind of portal and website available, I mean think
2597000	2607760	of like, you know, Myspace meets, you know, the Game Developers Association, you know,
2607760	2615280	the IGDA or, you know, gamasutra.com, right, those great websites out there, so, I mean,
2615280	2620960	you know, networking is so important in our industry where, you know, so much so that
2620960	2625160	I always, when I talk to people about, you know, people trying to get in the industry
2625160	2630200	or give speeches at schools or whatever, is that I always say that, you know, the creative
2630200	2638600	aspect of what you do is only about 50% of it, the other 50% is networking, so instead
2638600	2644520	of, you know, and I say that to any, you know, musician, instead of practicing piano for
2644520	2650640	ten hours a day, if you practice that for five hours a day and then you take the other
2650640	2657320	five hours and use that to network and to get to know people and to send emails or to,
2657320	2662760	you know, help better yourself or your personality or, you know, whatever, so, you know, people
2662760	2668960	have to, you know, I think one thing that I've learned is that it, you don't necessarily,
2668960	2675600	it's not all about talent, you know, it's about 50-50, so, you know, gang launching
2675600	2682680	this new website is really, you know, we have over 2,500 members in over 30 countries around
2682680	2687720	the world, we have scholarship programs for people looking to get in the industry, we
2687720	2695000	focus not only on the creative aspects of video game audio but also the technical aspects
2695000	2699840	and the business aspects as well because that's also very, very important and those three
2699840	2706240	things are key to being, you know, successful in the game audio industry but, you know,
2706240	2712000	there's apprenticeships and mentorships and, you know, for people looking to get in as
2712000	2718240	well, so that's our biggest thing is launching this new site, we're always working with schools
2718240	2725120	and universities all over the world on creating game audio curriculums for colleges and universities
2725120	2730480	and, by the way, some of these colleges and universities are places like Berklee School
2730480	2736960	of Music in Boston, places like UCLA and USC, I mean, some of the finest schools in the
2736960	2743240	world and even some specialized colleges, accredited colleges, you know, places like
2743240	2749960	Full Sail in Florida, for example, or Guildhall in Texas or Expressions in San Francisco,
2749960	2755600	so, you know, working, it's been a passion of mine from the beginning to really, you
2755600	2763240	know, help the game audio industry have more respect and to educate not only each other
2763240	2768120	as composers and sound designers but also to educate the developers and the publishers
2768120	2773640	as well because when I first got in this industry almost 20 years ago, they didn't care, they
2773640	2779080	didn't give a crap about video game audio, you know, it was so like, you know, I mean,
2779080	2784320	a typical day in the office, you know, back in the early 90s would be somebody walking
2784320	2790880	in my office saying, okay, the game's done, we don't have any music, we don't have any
2790880	2796040	money or budget, we don't have any space left on the cartridge and, oh, yeah, we got to
2796040	2800880	submit this in two days so we don't have any time either, can you make something sound
2800880	2806000	like something, whatever, here, you know, that was basically how you did game audio
2806000	2811480	back then. Now, of course, you know, it's completely changed and I think one thing that
2811480	2816840	you'll notice in the industry is that since Gang's inception back in, you know, the turn
2816840	2824080	of the century, you've seen the quality of audio and music go through the roof and that's
2824080	2830100	not just because of the technology, you know, you know, Gang, you know, should take a lot
2830100	2836120	of credit for that, for educating all those things, for educating them about, you know,
2836120	2842480	5.1 audio or, you know, budgets for live orchestras and how and why it makes a difference and
2842480	2847720	being involved from a project from the beginning, not just tailing it off at the end, it's not
2847720	2852620	post-production like film and television, what we do is so much different and so much
2852620	2859220	more interactive and providing the proper tools for sound designers and composers to
2859220	2865040	do what we need to do. These are all things that Gang does on a constant basis behind
2865040	2870520	the scenes, you know, some of our sponsors are EA and Dolby and some of these colleges
2870520	2877880	and schools and THX and, you know, all these DTS and, you know, all these amazing companies,
2877880	2884320	Microsoft and Intel and AMD and, you know, chip manufacturers and things. So, you know,
2884320	2889920	everybody believes in the message, it was just a matter of everyone banding together
2889920	2894940	and coming together as one to get that message out there as a group of people and that's
2894940	2899780	really what Gang is all about. Of course, we have our Gang Awards as well each year
2899780	2905640	where we have about 25 different categories, you know, everything from best sound design
2905640	2912300	of the year to best music of the year or best song for a video game, best licensed music
2912300	2918600	for a game, you know, there's best cinematic sound in a game, so there's all sorts of different
2918600	2923240	things that we award as well. And Bioshock cleaned up pretty much last year.
2923240	2926800	Yeah, I read that well deserved on them though.
2926800	2927800	Absolutely.
2927800	2931640	If we have any musically inclined folks listening to the program, I know we have a few that
2931640	2935160	are interested in this, it's audiogang.org, correct?
2935160	2940280	That is it, audiogang.org. If you're looking to get in the industry doing game audio, that's
2940280	2942400	the first great place to start.
2942400	2946760	All right, well, Tommy, I got one more question for you and thank you so much for spending
2946760	2950720	the time here with us tonight, but we always ask this, all of our guests we bring on the
2950720	2954600	program, it's the way we start off our show every week, we always talk about our gaming
2954600	2959120	weeks and the types of games we've been playing this week and what we've been enjoying. So,
2959120	2962760	Tommy, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games you've been into lately?
2962760	2972800	Fantastic. No, it's funny because yesterday was Father's Day. We're taping this interview,
2972800	2979520	but I don't know if I said it or not, but yesterday was Father's Day. And so, me and
2979520	2988000	my dad and my brother, we played the game Buzz on PlayStation 2. It's just basically
2988000	2993200	a trivia game. My dad isn't a huge gamer these days. He was when I was growing up. We'd always
2993200	2997880	go to the arcade and play Asteroids and Space Invaders together in the late 70s when I was
2997880	3006200	like 10. And he was a huge kick-my-ass and Pac-Man every night. But now, he's gotten
3006200	3012440	out of it. So, we played Buzz. I played Buzz this week. I played a little rock band this
3012440	3019720	week. But also, this might get people a little jealous. I've been playing Metal Gear Solid
3019720	3027120	4, of course. I've been playing that for a couple weeks due to having some friends in
3027120	3033720	some high places and getting versions before other folks. But the thing I've really been
3033720	3039320	playing because I've been working on putting this segment together for Video Games Live
3039320	3044520	is Guitar Hero Aerosmith, which hasn't hit the shelves yet, but I've been playing a lot
3044520	3046080	of that lately as well.
3046080	3049120	So something Guitar Hero related is coming to Video Games Live?
3049120	3055480	An interactive segment with Guitar Hero and Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. His real name
3055480	3061680	is Steven Telerico. He's my cousin. We've been always talking about doing something
3061680	3068680	together and ended up getting them hooked up with Activision to get that product on
3068680	3075800	the market the first time ever. A band has its own music video game with Guitar Hero,
3075800	3078520	so we're all really proud of that.
3078520	3083880	Yeah, I'm going to put together, wouldn't it be cool if somebody could come up on stage
3083880	3092360	and play a song from Guitar Hero Aerosmith while playing along on the big screen with
3092360	3097600	the orchestra and with some live musicians on stage as well? Wouldn't that be cool?
3097600	3101920	That would be awesome, and thankfully it's Aerosmith and not that Dragonforce song from
3101920	3105800	Guitar Hero 3, because then I think we'd all like, you know, I would want to lose in front
3105800	3110240	of all those people. Aerosmith I think I could probably handle. I know those songs pretty
3110240	3111240	well.
3111240	3117480	Well, Tommy Telerico, the man behind Video Games Live, the man behind Gang, and the soundtrack
3117480	3120480	to so many video games. Thank you so much for spending the time tonight here on Orange
3120480	3125560	Lawns Radio talking about everything, and best of luck to you through the next few dates
3125560	3126560	of your tour.
3126560	3132800	Thank you, and I really appreciate you taking the time to help spread the word, because
3132800	3140760	I think what you guys are doing are so important to us and the growth of this thing, and talking
3140760	3146200	about it really helps us out in helping to spread the word, so thank you.
3146200	3148480	No problem, Tommy. Best of luck to you.
3148480	3150680	Okay, thanks.
3150680	3154640	Thank you so much to Tommy for taking the time to talk to us here at Orange Lawns Radio.
3154640	3159640	It was a lot of fun. He's pretty chatty, but a lot of really insightful information about
3159640	3161000	how the whole process works.
3161000	3166720	And it's funny, because I didn't believe it when he said it, Steven Tyler's last name
3166720	3167920	is actually Telerico.
3167920	3171040	Yeah, I kind of thought it was a joke when I first heard it too. That's why I didn't
3171040	3176380	follow up on that at all, but no, it is true. He is actually related to Steven Tyler, which
3176380	3178480	means he's also related to Liv Tyler.
3178480	3180640	All right, anyhow.
3180640	3181640	Hey.
3181640	3182640	What?
3182640	3184880	So, you can be related.
3184880	3190400	Yeah, it's just kind of neat. I kind of thought he was joking. Like, oh yeah, he's my bro.
3190400	3194080	He's my cousin. You know, that type of thing. I was just very surprised.
3194080	3197360	And it's so funny, because, you know, Loki, you exclaimed something like, if it's not
3197360	3202840	on Wikipedia, it's not true. And then he went to Wikipedia, and I just heard, oh. I guess
3202840	3203840	it is true.
3203840	3210360	All right, anyhow, we've got some more gaming news to cover. I know you guys on Skype are
3210360	3213360	eager to call in, so we want to get to you guys as well. We have a few more stories for
3213360	3215320	you guys quick, though. We'll start off with Loki.
3215320	3220120	Okay, well, last week, you know, the PSP got firmware 4.0. Well, of course, they couldn't
3220120	3227240	leave it just like that, so they put out 4.01, which, you know, is just, I guess, to make
3227240	3234560	sure that 4.0 was working correctly. And updates as far as, doesn't really say what, they improved
3234560	3237920	some of the search features, I guess. And that's about it.
3237920	3242360	Well, I don't know if they were trying to stop the homebrew stuff, but, like, pretty
3242360	3248400	much the very next day, the custom firmware 4.01 was released, so.
3248400	3256360	Yeah, Peaker Junior92 in chat says, or PK Junior, I want to say it really fast, 4.01
3256360	3257360	is a joke.
3257360	3258360	Yeah.
3258360	3264640	Just like 911 is a joke. 4.01 is a joke. Maybe that could be a hit new song. 4.01 is a joke.
3264640	3271080	Oh, I forget it. Not a joke. The whole annoying digital rights management thing on the Xbox
3271080	3277400	Live, guess what? They have finally fixed it. There is a new DRM tool, digital rights
3277400	3284440	management tool that is available on Xbox site, on the Microsoft site. This is originally
3284440	3288440	going to be a part of the next patch or the next release, but it's actually available
3288440	3293740	now. It's available on Xbox.com. You can manage the digital rights contents of arcade titles
3293740	3297920	that you've downloaded and so on. I haven't used this myself, but I should, because my
3297920	3302560	original Xbox 360 died of the red rings of death, so I have this awkward digital management
3302560	3306680	thing with Geometry Wars and Joust, which were the first two arcade titles I ever bought.
3306680	3309840	So I should go in and try to fix that. So now you don't have to go through this whole
3309840	3313680	mess of getting the points credited back to you and all this stuff. In fact, you can see
3313680	3317560	the three-step process here. Make sure you've signed into Xbox Live with this account and
3317560	3321480	whatever your name is. Go to the Xbox Live Marketplace and select Account Management,
3321480	3325840	Download History. Select an item and then select Download again. Repeat step three for
3325840	3330640	each item in your download history. There you go. So if you're willing to re-download
3330640	3337320	the stuff, you can use the tool on Xbox.com to do it for you. And certainly that saves
3337320	3345480	customer service, a crap load of phone calls. So everybody wins in this scenario. Yay.
3345480	3351240	I win. What did you win? I win a story. Oh, and what would this story be about?
3351240	3357680	Well, okay, everyone knows that one of the coolest voice actors in the world, in my opinion
3357680	3364080	anyway, is David Hader. You know, he has written movies, done a fairly good job with the first
3364080	3369880	X-Men movie, actually with the first two X-Men movies since he did the screenplays. But he
3369880	3375720	is actually looking for a petition out to get all of the fans to sign so that he writes
3375720	3383440	the Metal Gear movie. Interesting. Well, honestly, I would have to think that he would know Snake
3383440	3390680	better than just about anybody except maybe Kojima. Or so many other people on Kojima's
3390680	3395320	team. But I think, though, that when you're the person who puts the personality into the
3395320	3402760	character, I think that you would have a bit of insight into how to properly write for
3402760	3410240	that character. So I think it's pretty cool. Well, I kind of wonder, what kind of writing
3410240	3415480	creds does he have? Well, I just said that he wrote the screenplays for the first two
3415480	3424920	X-Men movies. Oh, sorry. It's okay. And he's doing an adaptation of Watchmen. But he's
3424920	3435680	actually looking to have everyone actually email a rep at Sony Pictures. The address
3435680	3439080	is, and I'm going to go ahead and say it on the air, because honestly, I would love for
3439080	3447880	him to write the movie. He does a good job. But it's Matt, M-A-T-T underscore T-O-L-M-A-C-H
3447880	3455040	at S-P-E dot Sony dot com. So send those emails in and actually use good grammar. Please spell
3455040	3460080	check for the win. This is a really good opportunity for us to try and get David Hader on the show.
3460080	3463320	I know I'm going to email. I'm gonna see if you realize I'm going to be sitting in the
3463320	3468520	corner fan gasming the whole fanning yourself actually really good looking to see what we
3468520	3474620	can do about that. In a reference to the video that we saw the other day and no one else
3474620	3482720	will get blurred fluids. Nobody's going to understand that. What? YouTube joke. What
3482720	3487560	was I going to say here? Some comments here in the chat room. DJ Dark Knight says as long
3487560	3494700	as he plays him. You never know. Going back to the last story, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf,
3494700	3497420	our next door neighbor on All Games wanted to point out about the whole digital right
3497420	3501480	management tool. You can only use it once every 12 months. You have to manually re-download
3501480	3505000	every title. If you have a lot of titles, it's going to take you a couple hours to get
3505000	3508720	all that stuff. Again, you can only use the tool once every 12 months. But that should
3508720	3512480	be enough. I mean, how many people get more than one Xbox a year unless you really get
3512480	3516900	screwed with the red rings of death? I mean, certainly it could happen. But iTunes has
3516900	3520600	a similar policy. I think you can reset your iTunes digital rights management like once
3520600	3524640	a year as well. But of course, then again, you can also install the music on like four
3524640	3531640	different computers. Something like that. Awesome. Well, remember there was a big to-do
3531880	3537760	about the whole hot coffee crap in Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas. And then there was a settlement
3537760	3542320	where people could possibly get money for not even having purchased Grand Theft Auto.
3542320	3547860	But you know, you just have to pretend that you did. Well, the response to the whole thing
3547860	3554860	was really only 2,676 claims. You didn't say 26,000, you said 2,000. 2,676. And how many
3557960	3562740	people bought Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas? Approximately 12 million. Eleventy billion?
3562740	3569740	So that apparently is approximately 0.022% of the consumers that actually were offended
3571260	3575720	and upset from the content in the game. In other words, people looking for a free lunch,
3575720	3581160	courtesy of Take-Two from McDonald's. And essentially that equals up to about only $1.3
3581160	3588160	million in fees. Oh, I'm sorry. Only about $30,000 in claims from all that. And apparently
3591680	3598680	the suit seeking $1.3 million in legal fees. That's funny. Wow. Just wow. If I had the
3598680	3605680	stupid award music still cute, I'd probably play it right about now, but unfortunately
3606040	3610360	I left that party. See, everyone was complaining that it was such a big deal and everyone was
3610360	3616360	making a big deal. You know who that 0.22% or 0.022% was? Jack Thompson and his family.
3616360	3619360	Fucking media. And just people blowing the shit out of proportion. People wanting to
3619360	3623680	see if it worked or not. Yeah. Seriously, out of those 2,000, how many just wanted to
3623680	3627960	see if it would work? That's what I'm curious about. If they got money. Did anybody in our
3627960	3632400	chat room do it? Probably not. Alright, well one other bit of news for you and then we're
3632400	3637760	going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio and
3637760	3642800	it is a PlayStation story and it's about the PlayStation Network specifically. I'm surprised
3642800	3646840	neither one of these games has been the classic game of the week yet, but maybe soon. After
3646840	3652700	all, they are going to make a resurgence pretty soon. Einhonder and Xenogears are now going
3652700	3657200	to be on the PlayStation Network. I like Einhonder. I'm surprised. We still need Zweihander.
3657200	3663640	I'm surprised Xenogears is on there since I think it's a multiple disc game. Well, hey,
3663640	3669040	they've got a lot of storage space on that PlayStation 3. So anyhow, you can now download
3669040	3673840	these songs. You can download these games on the PlayStation Network and there you have
3673840	3677640	it. They're being sold right now in Japan. Sorry, you can't do it here. It's being sold
3677640	3683440	for 600 yen a piece. That's about $5.56. Not bad. But unfortunately, both these games are
3683440	3688320	pretty text heavy, so you would probably need to understand Japanese. Not Einhonder. You
3688320	3692960	just fucking kill things. I'm looking right at Xenogears as I'm saying. Xenogears. Xenogears,
3692960	3698360	yeah. But if you know Japanese, hey, there you go. By the way, Squeenix USA has commented
3698360	3702480	there is currently no plans to bring this to the American Network. Yeah, well, we'll
3702480	3708720	see. Money talks, people. Money talks. And now you talk. 1877 Game OLR. Our username
3708720	3711920	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to the Skype line. The calls are already coming
3711920	3715920	in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? There is currently no plans to bring
3715920	3720240	this to the American Network. I'm hearing myself. Are you there? Talks, people. Money
3720240	3727800	talks. Okay. Please call Echo 1-2-3. If I hear myself or Dark Soccer or Loki on the
3727800	3732560	call, that's grounds for immediate hang up. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3732560	3737440	Hey, hey, it's Ranma. Hey, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy? Hello. Hey, everyone. I
3737440	3740960	know what you were doing last night. I know what you were doing last night, too. Tell
3740960	3747600	us about it. I know what you did last night. Well, besides getting, uh, drunk with freeze
3747600	3752960	pop. Wait, so, when you say, you don't mean you were actually getting drunk at a freeze
3752960	3757220	pop concert, although that is probably true as well. You actually went out and got drunk
3757220	3762640	with freeze pop the band. Yes, this is what actually happened. I was at a broom party
3762640	3767300	having a good time and I left, you know, to bring some more alcohol up and I was going
3767300	3771880	up the stairs and I saw them and the girl, I think it was Elizabeth, she said, um, is
3771880	3777720	there a party going on? I'm like, yeah, follow me. Follow me right into the, um, party and
3777720	3781440	we've been partying ever since. And right now I'm actually downloading all the pictures
3781440	3786760	from the party with them as we speak. Did you remind them that OLR loves them muchly?
3786760	3793440	Yes, I did. In between shots. Nice. I doubt they even remember us. Only one of them came
3793440	3797680	on the show, but you never know. So that's what, were you just Liz or the whole band
3797680	3802560	or what? The whole band. That's awesome. So there you have it. Doing shots with the band.
3802560	3806280	Did they happen to let slip any, uh, things they might have coming up in the game world?
3806280	3808940	You know, I read recently one of their emails that went out to everybody, there was a little
3808940	3812880	bit of freeze pop controversy about the fact that their song, uh, I am not your game boy
3812880	3818680	is on guitar hero DS because it's actually not by harmonics anymore. Right. But, and
3818680	3822360	so they wanted to kind of clear the air that, Hey, they're loaning their songs out to, you
3822360	3826720	know, or no, the deal was that I think if I remember I read it on their site, they don't
3826720	3831320	get paid when they're in their harmonics games. Um, they do it just, you know, for the love
3831320	3834840	of harmonics for the love of those games, but they were getting paid by Konami when
3834840	3840760	it was in DDR by Sony, you know, branded games and by, you know, the folks who did guitar
3840760	3846360	hero on tour. So yeah, a little, a little freeze pop controversy. I thought I'd clear
3846360	3851400	up. Well, they really are talented. I mean, after seeing him the second time, it was really
3851400	3856800	awesome. They really deserve more. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. That's yeah. They they're
3856800	3860400	destined for stardom eventually, you know, they're, they're on the brain. Everybody knows
3860400	3866360	some of their songs from rock band and all that stuff. So, well, they did a new song
3866360	3872040	at the concert. Oh really? Yeah. They covered a popular song from the eighties as an encore
3872040	3881040	song. What was it? The final countdown. Nice. And um, that's definitely key to our friendly.
3881040	3886920	Definitely. Hey, that could be, you never know rock band too. Maybe who knows? Um, Hey,
3886920	3889720	here's the thing though. Next time you go drinking with Liz, since now you like have
3889720	3894080	her number in your black book or whatever, tell them that a OLR would love a new theme
3894080	3897320	song, you know, no disrespect to midi head, but we've been using the opening song now
3897320	3902960	for like two years. So we're looking for something new. So just the thought, I may be able to
3902960	3907040	do something. I know somebody knows somebody, so I may be able to cash in a favor. So I
3907040	3909720	would love you forever. All right. What else is going on in your world? Anything else you
3909720	3914680	want to update our listeners on real quick? Well, you're ready to drink this weekend.
3914680	3918400	Oh my God. That's right. You're coming to town. No, I can't drink. I could drink cider
3918400	3922560	and milk. Okay. I'll drink cider with you. Okay. I can't hear your cider will probably
3922560	3930520	be special cider. Oh, we'll get the, uh, the, um, uh, Blackthorn for us. No, I'm looking
3930520	3934240	forward to you being in town and uh, I'm looking forward to the 4th of July party when we're
3934240	3941120	going to set things on fire. Yes. Oh yeah. Rob. Yes. I have a surprise for you. Yay.
3941120	3946000	I like surprises. I'm going to present it next week. If I can be on the show, of course
3946000	3949460	you can be on the show. I thought you were already coming to the show. Just want to make
3949460	3955560	sure, you know, so Rama will be here in studio next week. All right. So until then I'm hanging
3955560	3962140	up on you. Cause you have all next week to talk to us. All right. Later. That's right.
3962140	3967520	That is next week. Isn't it? God time flies. That means I have to do, I'm going to be busy
3967520	3974080	this time to clean the house. Well, I already, I, my house is pretty clean. I just got to
3974080	3980280	change the cat litter. You okay over there, Loki? Sorry. I'm just getting this working.
3980280	3985520	I heard myself. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Uh, J rod. Hey, Jay rod.
3985520	3990260	What's on your mind, buddy? Uh, just asking you guys, what are you looking forward to
3990260	3994320	for you three of the most. So it's right around the corner. What am I looking forward to E3
3994320	3997940	the most? You know me personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how much of Microsoft press
3997940	4002640	conference really did get spoiled. I'm looking forward to all the press conferences. I love
4002640	4007360	sitting there not working and reading the press conferences. I really am looking forward
4007360	4011820	to seeing if animal crossing MMO or we or whatever. I'm looking forward to seeing if
4011820	4014780	animal if it is true that animal crossing is coming back to Nintendo and what they're
4014780	4019640	doing with it. I J I am so freaking curious is killing me. And of course I want it to
4019640	4022760	address the space issues so I gotta say Nintendo's press conference I'm
4022760	4024100	definitely looking forward to
4024100	4028360	Sony I don't know what I'm looking forward to hearing from Sony but
4028360	4031100	sometimes they really surprise you on left field so I don't think you can
4031100	4031960	predict Sony
4031960	4035520	Microsoft if the rumors are true they're gonna have an interesting press
4035520	4036320	conference ahead of them
4036320	4040640	I'm also looking forward to seeing how the absence of these companies is gonna
4040640	4042880	play into the E3 reports this year with all these
4042880	4046560	companies dropping out. Loki, Dark Sakura, anything you wanna add?
4046560	4050880	No, they'll just have pretty much like Activision so since they're not gonna be
4050880	4053000	there they'll probably have their own little press conference that'll
4053000	4056720	take place at the same time. I mean it'll pretty much be the same damn coverage.
4056720	4061160	I still think that they made a mistake with cutting out the
4061160	4063880	fanfare I just think they should have been a bit more discerning as to
4063880	4065240	invitations that's all.
4065240	4069000	Very disappointing but have you looked at the Penny Arcade
4069000	4072840	exhibitor list? Now that I'm happy about. That's doing it right.
4072840	4076040	You wanna hear something that really would piss you off?
4076040	4079880	My company got one invite to E3 and they said oh forget it we're not going.
4079880	4083440	I'm like you fuckers. You fucking whores.
4083440	4087320	Okay Jayrod I'm turning the tables a little bit what are you looking forward
4087320	4088360	to seeing at E3?
4088360	4093860	I am looking forward to Gears of War 2. That is my main game for this year.
4093860	4098160	Gears of War 2 and I wanna see how the new Silent Hill is turning out.
4098160	4101320	Oh I'm kinda iffy about that one. Apparently
4101320	4104040	and I haven't seen this myself but a buddy was telling me about this that
4104040	4106880	apparently the first 10 minutes of the game are out there on the internet and it
4106880	4107720	looks pretty good.
4107720	4111080	I don't wanna spoil anything. I'm gonna have to pass on that.
4111080	4114320	I don't either but you know I'm curious. But yeah Gears of War oh man people are
4114320	4115480	just loving that first game.
4115480	4119520	That'll definitely be a centerpiece of Microsoft's press conference. Probably the big final
4119520	4121040	thing they'll show since there's no
4121040	4124120	Halo this year. That's probably their second biggest franchise I can think of.
4124120	4127280	Chat room is asking about Kid Icarus Wii.
4127280	4132040	If it's true which I think it might be I'm definitely curious. That is another
4132040	4132880	curiosity.
4132880	4136120	I'm trying not to get my hopes up too high because I just have this really bad
4136120	4137800	feeling. I'm gonna look at it and go
4137800	4141040	ew it's so different.
4141040	4145600	Something tells me they're not going the Mega Man 9 route and giving us a new
4145600	4146640	retro game.
4146640	4150200	So that's what I think about Kid Icarus.
4150200	4154200	Alright well J-Rod thanks so much for the call. Anything else you want to share
4154200	4155280	really quickly?
4155280	4158120	Alright well have a good one.
4158120	4162120	Appreciate it. I had Italian today.
4162120	4165240	Did you? Yes I had Mary's Pizza Shack.
4165240	4168640	I thought you couldn't have pizza. Well I can't but on
4168640	4172360	they have pasta dishes there and there was a pasta dish with marinara because I can
4172360	4174560	usually have like light marinara pastas.
4174560	4177800	So it was good times. Alright I better hang up on J-Rod. Bye bye.
4177800	4181960	Thank you very much. Did you really want to hear us talk about Italian food the whole time?
4181960	4186200	Osfer says I saw a trailer for the new Silent Hill. It looked really scary.
4186200	4190120	I hope so. There's not
4190120	4193320	that many games I'm excited about right now but that Silent Hill 5 is one of
4193320	4196920	them. That game is supposed to be out sooner rather than later so we shall see
4196920	4198000	very soon.
4198000	4201960	What do you guys think? You want to do one more call? One more quick call?
4201960	4205120	Alright. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
4205120	4211240	Hola. Bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio.
4211240	4215120	Echo 123. Is it that hard?
4215120	4220800	Alright. That's it. We're closing the Skype line.
4220800	4225760	I can't deal with the lack of Echo 123 tonight.
4225760	4229200	Alright. I guess that's gonna do it.
4229200	4232800	We're gonna go around and wrap it up. First we gotta get some last minute stories.
4232800	4236800	Do I have a last minute story? I see you giggling over there. I'm just in a giggle
4236800	4240760	giggle mood. Why? Because I am. You can't be happy.
4240760	4244480	It's not allowed. I can be as happy as I want to be Rob.
4244480	4248400	And I'm gonna whine so that you have to put up with it.
4248400	4252000	No I don't. Neener. Loki you have any last minute stories?
4252000	4256120	Uh. You did? Yes. Alright then read it. Stop your bitching.
4256120	4260120	This is
4260120	4263360	a story that Sauce gave me
4263360	4266720	like an hour ago or so that
4266720	4270040	Apple Corps has given the okay
4270040	4275240	for a computer game to be released based on the Beatles.
4275240	4278800	Since they own the master recordings. Really? Yep.
4278800	4283160	Very interesting. And they are
4283160	4286960	trying to decide who's gonna get it and they are between Activision and MTV
4286960	4288000	games.
4288000	4291480	Oh snap.
4291480	4295040	Is that for real? That is crazy. Alright.
4295040	4297920	We'll see. Loki you have any last minute stories?
4297920	4301040	Um. I don't know.
4301040	4305640	No. Not really. Really? Wow. Yeah well I haven't been looking at
4305640	4309480	last minute stories. I've been working on other crap. Apparently Catwoman is gonna be
4309480	4312800	Marvel vs. DC Universe and she has
4312800	4316160	a lot of cleavage apparently. Surprise.
4316160	4319880	Tigerclaw mentions in chatroom. By the way Sky you know that Bill Gates
4319880	4321440	officially retired.
4321440	4326080	Yes. But he'll still always be kind of like a mascot of sorts to that company
4326080	4327880	don't you think?
4327880	4331320	I mean he's gone but he's not. You know what I mean? Well didn't he drop out of
4331320	4334640	high school and start his own company?
4334640	4338040	Hey you know what? Just a day's dedication. Seriously?
4338040	4341280	Just a day's dedication. Alright well. He dropped out of college that was it.
4341280	4344880	Yeah. Well so did I and look at me I'm on the internet with the
4344880	4348880	radio program with my friends. Hey. Winners don't use drugs.
4348880	4352160	Alright let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4352160	4356120	Loki what's your final thought tonight? I fucking hate
4356120	4359200	PHP.
4359200	4362320	My final thought is I
4362320	4365400	really want another piece of ice cream cake
4365400	4368560	because the one I cheated with on my birthday and had was really
4368560	4373560	really really fucking good. Dark Soccer your final thought tonight.
4373560	4378120	I really want some creme brulee right now. Oh my fucking god creme brulee is the shit.
4378120	4382040	I'm gonna go get some creme brulee ice cream I think.
4382040	4386720	Since we are orange lounge foodie-o I have to mention real quick. This is our first mention of food tonight.
4386720	4391160	Olive Garden. Yeah we did have Olive Garden. Here's the thing. Did you know that Claim
4391160	4393040	Jumper now has like a healthy menu with
4393040	4397320	foods under 600 calories a dish or something? Under 600 calories a dish.
4397320	4401480	Look for them. Half a day food. For them that's that's really good.
4401480	4405120	Well a bowl of soup and some of their garlic toast is under 600.
4405120	4407960	Yeah but now they have like salads and stuff that are really good and under
4407960	4411760	under 600 calories. What was I gonna say?
4411760	4414840	I don't know but they're really good. Oh they have the creme brulee. They have like a new dessert dish
4414840	4417240	that's three of different flavors of creme brulee.
4417240	4420520	Like the green tea and all that stuff and the little tiny dishes. Do you want?
4420520	4425040	My god so I do kinda want actually. Although I probably should be good after
4425040	4426600	massively cheating on my birthday.
4426600	4432360	This isn't really a last minute story but it's it's interesting nonetheless.
4432360	4436840	But apparently there's a price drop on a cat skin for your Wii.
4436840	4441920	Yes it's a cute little kitten that you can put on your Wii.
4441920	4447280	I will post it in chat. There you have it.
