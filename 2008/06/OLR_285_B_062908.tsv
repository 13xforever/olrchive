449	5515	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5876	14726	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15426	19070	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20199	20680	We'll be right back.
41443	58302	and tonight for your entertainment Tommy Tallarico is going to be here on Orange Laundry to talk about video games live very shortly but first we're going to talk about some gaming news and I thought since you know we are going to be talking about music and video games how about some music news you have some music game news for us Loki you could share
58582	59922	Yes, I do actually.
60563	61863	There's some pretty interesting stuff.
61883	64444	We've been kind of hoping for this to actually happen.
65004	80869	But apparently a box shot of Samba de Amigo, a bundle with Maraca controller add-ons, has been seen at UK retailer HMV's website.
81149	87334	Now, I hope they aren't the cheapy, crappy little plastic snap-on things like you've seen for Wii Golf and Wii Tennis, right?
87354	89596	Like, they need to make the shaky maraca noise.
90597	93459	It looks like that they have maracas on top of it.
93639	96321	I don't know if they make the shaky noise, but I don't see why they wouldn't.
96341	99824	If you're going to do maraca controllers, do them right, or don't do them at all, right?
100044	103227	And it's right now on there for €34.99, which is about $70.
103267	103367	Yeah.
107831	109512	And we always like to read comments from chat.
109652	114195	The ever-present fourth guest on our show at chat.orangeloungeradio.com live on Sunday.
114235	117798	And J-Rod says simply, Maracas equals win.
118959	120080	Maracas do equal win.
121141	123142	What other games could be made better by Maracas?
123322	124964	DarkSakura, you think of anything?
125564	127546	Games that could be made better with Maracas?
127626	127886	Yes.
128927	129107	Um... Um...
132577	133158	Soul Calibur?
133318	133618	I don't know.
133958	135240	Yes, Maraca Calibur.
135640	137162	Because remember, I did Rod Calibur.
137182	138603	Yeah, you do Rod Calibur on the Dreamcast.
138623	139924	Simply be Maraca Calibur.
139944	140325	There you go.
140685	142287	I've got Maraca's controllers.
142847	145830	Me too, on Dreamcast, believe it or not.
145850	147052	Let's try Maraca's Calibur.
147272	149794	Actually, any game can be played with the Maraca's...
151883	153824	3rdBullet suggests Gears of Maracas.
154385	155565	Gears of Maracas?
156046	158587	Miso suggests Cooking Mama is better with Maracas.
159128	167594	The only thing that's kind of weird about the Maraca controller, though, I noticed, is that... Where's the infrared going to come out?
167794	169635	Unless it goes all the way through the middle there.
170055	173318	Because it looks like the top's covered by the Maracas.
173918	174358	Who knows?
174719	175019	Who knows?
175905	180849	Well, one game that will not be made better by Maracas is a game near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Launch Radio.
180909	182730	It's Beatmania 2DX.
182770	185992	You know, this series has been around forever, a long, long time.
186032	192377	Like, I remember when we first started this show, probably like Six Style was the hot new thing that was out on the block, I think, when this show started.
193237	193858	I think so.
194338	194658	Beatmania 2DX16
223726	225527	That is incredibly gay looking.
225567	226087	Yes, it is.
226367	226888	Hey, wait a minute.
227848	228829	No, it really is.
229149	232871	It's a pink Sailor Moon looking logo with a butterfly.
232951	233511	2DX16 Empress.
233771	237133	There's a little butterfly hanging off the S and it's pink.
237533	239094	It is very, very, very pink.
239474	239494	V2
262859	264081	is supposed to be in this game.
264241	266103	A sequel to V by Taka.
266443	268866	One of the most horrid songs in Beatmania 2DX history.
269707	273071	If you've ever walked by a Beatmania or a DDR machine, you've probably heard this one.
273091	276234	It actually is a V final from that Taka album that came out.
277095	277195	Ah.
277776	278376	There you go.
278916	294861	So Beatmania 2DX Empress location testing right now, which means they'll probably be out in Japan in a couple months, and you'll probably see the home version in Japan only, sadly, early next year because they tried to release Beatmania here, and unfortunately it didn't do too well because people thought it was a Guitar Hero ripoff.
295942	300303	Shame on Konami for sitting on what could have been a gold mine for far, far, far too long.
301786	316995	Well, another potential goldmine, and this is one that was sent to us by the lovely and talented Sauce, is a Rumor of Guitar Hero Beatles edition, which actually I think would be pretty cool.
318356	319517	That would be kind of neat.
320918	323960	I think that more of the young whippersnappers need to hear some Beatles music.
325197	341428	Well, the Sony ATV CEO, Marty Bondier, I guess, said that they've actually talked about putting Beatles songs in a Guitar Hero game as something that you'd like to pursue, and that's a quote.
342169	345391	So, maybe it could happen?
346209	347550	You're getting booted from the chat room.
347610	348050	Watch me do it.
374093	376154	This is not a democracy here at OLR.
376174	377615	This is a Jamieocracy.
378795	379235	Who is it?
379315	379876	Third Bullet?
380736	381597	You have to read.
382597	382957	All right.
383017	383698	Jamocracy?
384058	385038	Jamocracy?
385458	386019	Jamocracy.
386039	386359	Yeah.
386679	387259	Revolution!
388260	388840	Off with her head.
389660	390121	I'm just kidding.
390501	390761	All right.
392717	400646	Well, um... I don't know if we're gonna... We'll probably be getting this before we'll see Beatles on any sort of system for it.
400767	409056	But Rock Band is getting, um... I guess some tracks from Crew Fest, which is the Motley Crue tour, I guess.
409837	410418	And, um...
411764	414666	They've got a few tracks on here, including a free one.
415807	419969	Part of the CrewFest pack, which is going to be 240 Microsoft points, or $3.
420410	422891	You've got Down at the Whiskey by Motley Crue.
423932	426493	You've got Time is Running Out by Papa Roach.
427214	430116	Who's Going Home With You Tonight by Trapped.
430556	434298	And also the free track, Promised Land by...
435766	437327	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
466263	466803	G4's Judgment Day
488712	500961	So we reached out to Tommy to come on the show to talk about the upcoming tour As well as respond to some of the recent emails we've gotten about Video Games Live So let's head on over to the Skype line Alright, hey Tommy, are you there?
501622	505344	Yo, I am here Hey Tommy Tallarico, how are you doing this fine evening?
506205	515312	I'm doing great, working as always You must be a very, very busy man traveling to all these new places on the Video Games Live tour Do you actually go to all the shows yourself?
516024	522366	Oh yeah, every single show aside from creating and producing the show every night.
522466	526968	I also host the show and even play guitar with the symphony towards the end.
527608	533851	So you've got to be pretty exhausted because not only are you balancing video games live, but video games live isn't the only thing you do either.
535020	555326	Yeah, I mean, aside from still working on a few smaller game projects here and there, because VGL definitely takes up most of 95% of my time, but working on a couple DS and Wii and PC products, as well as also the chairman of the Game Audio Network Guild.
555806	556067	Excellent.
556087	563175	Well, I definitely want to ask you about the Game Audio Network Guild, but I know the listeners want to hear about Video Games Live, absolutely, because we've gotten emails and calls about it.
563556	565438	Let me ask you this about Video Games Live.
565478	570865	You're going to so many new places on this 50-day city tour you just announced.
571325	575130	What can someone who has never been to Video Games Live before expect to experience?
576299	604445	Video Games Live is all the greatest video game music of all time played by a full symphony and choir but what makes it really unique is that everything is completely synchronized with video and rock and roll lighting and special effects and interactivity with the crowd and stage show production and we have a whole pre-show festival with gaming competitions and prize giveaways and
604805	619375	Costume Contest, Post Show, Meet & Greet It really is a complete celebration of the entire video game industry.
619455	628942	In fact, I like to describe it as all of the power and emotion of a symphony orchestra combined with the excitement and energy of a rock concert
629480	630822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
644891	647412	We really wanted to create an event.
647472	650153	We wanted to create a show.
650253	659437	We didn't want to just create a concert or, oh yeah, here's a bunch of classical people in tuxedos up on a stage playing video game music.
660377	667480	That's great as well, but people have been doing that in Japan for almost 20 years now.
668481	672126	We wanted to do something completely new, completely unique.
672567	677314	And really, our goal from the beginning was to create this show for...
677864	679425	The Non-Gamer as well.
679726	693078	We wanted to create something that had mass appeal and that you don't have to know a darn thing at all about video games in order to come to the show and really be blown away and entertained.
693338	700225	And that's why Video Games Live has grown so quickly and as big as it has.
700265	701386	We did three shows in 2005.
703520	707241	11 shows in 2006, 29 last year in 2007.
707981	710082	This year we have over 50 shows.
710602	712603	Next year we have over 80 shows.
712663	718304	And the goal is to build it by 2010 up to 100 and to 120 shows a year.
718464	727707	So by having all these visuals and by creating a performance and a production and an event and a show,
728365	729245	and many more.
750409	757971	And again, that's not to downplay what all of the amazing concerts in the past have done and continue to do, but ours is a little different.
758671	763613	Let me go off of that a little bit, because you talk about making this concert accessible to even those that are non-gamers.
763633	765813	And I know we have a lot of listeners that are a little bit younger, 15, 16, 17.
767214	770235	It's a little harder for them to just kind of get up and go get a concert ticket.
770275	774976	What would you say would be the best way to sell a night at Video Games Live to my parents?
775697	777058	Yeah, oh, absolutely.
777118	783202	Well, I mean, of course, there's a website, videogameslive.com, and we have a bunch of trailers on there.
783602	787185	And you'll see parents in their 40s and 50s.
787225	790307	You'll see grandmas in their 60s and 70s.
790547	793229	You'll see little girls, 7, 8, 9 years old, all saying,
795640	796200	www.DarkSakura.com
824264	834470	Why I created this in the beginning was to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games and of course their music have become.
834870	840073	And so the best letters and emails that we get after a performance, they come pouring in.
840293	841834	They're all from non-gamers.
842154	853060	They're all from the people who are blown away going, oh my gosh, I never knew that video games were this incredible and the music was so powerful and the characters and the storylines were so
853510	854150	www.DarkSakura.com
869642	878604	We'll put in these comments and we'll put in, we show all of the reviews that we've gotten for the show and all of the comments and letters from people and non-gamers.
878644	886746	And in those reviews, they all kind of, you know, follow the same thing going, well, you know what, I wasn't into video games, I didn't know what to expect, but wow, you know.
886846	896168	So it's word of mouth that really is, I kind of compare us a little bit in that respect to Cirque du Soleil in that, you know, the first time people had
896448	897769	I've heard of Cirque du Soleil.
897809	898749	I know I was one of them.
898790	900350	I was kind of like, what the hell is it?
900531	903272	Is it circus animals running around?
903332	904033	Clowns?
904533	905413	I don't get it.
905454	914559	It was only until you saw it with your own two eyes or somebody really close to you explained it in great detail where you start to go, oh, I get it.
914979	920463	So, I mean, yeah, you could watch the 1,500 plus YouTube videos that are on there right now.
920503	922764	You do a search for video games live and they'll all come up.
923462	940268	But a lot of people always tell us, you know, I watched all the YouTube videos, but until you're there, until you're experiencing that magic of being in a room with 3, 4, 5,000 people all experiencing it at once, there's some magic that goes on.
940868	943469	YouTube is never a substitution for anything like this.
944229	944749	Absolutely.
945409	949310	Whatever you guys are doing, however the word is getting out there, obviously it's working.
949630	954232	Video Games Live is coming up on its three-year anniversary pretty soon, if I'm not mistaken.
955492	960614	Based on what you're saying, ramping up to 120 shows in 2010, it's not slowing down anytime soon.
961054	967156	What would you say, Tommy, is the biggest accomplishment, the biggest thing you've accomplished from Video Games Live in its three-year history so far?
968116	969936	Well, you know, I think that...
972597	973597	I had a dream.
973918	982922	Myself and my fellow video game composer, Jack Wall, who also conducts video games live, and we kind of created the show together.
982982	985943	It took us three years to create the show.
986063	994567	And in the beginning, we started this in 2002, and everyone thought we were completely insane and completely crazy.
994607	997548	So I would say that our biggest... Show them.
1002510	1010412	is getting this thing up and running to the point where... I could point to certain singular things that happened.
1010452	1017673	For example, our first show ever was at the Hollywood Bowl on July 6, 2005 with the LA Phil.
1017994	1022094	Over 11,000 people showed up to that show.
1022494	1026355	People thought 2,000 or 3,000 people were going to show up or whatever.
1027496	1029336	What an accomplishment to say that
1030237	1033439	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1045524	1053548	The First to Play in Brazil and places like Spain and London, England, New Zealand, things like that.
1053768	1070255	I can point to a lot of those things, but I just think the idea that this is surviving and growing at the rate it is, I think when everyone in the beginning told us we were insane and crazy and it would never work, that's the greatest accomplishment for us.
1070697	1083000	And kind of building on that, because you've talked about all these places you've been, and that you're kind of the first video game concert in Canada, and the first concert in Asia, and things kind of keep growing.
1083080	1087041	I mean, through these latest tour dates, you guys are going to Germany, China, Thailand, Portugal.
1087061	1090062	I mean, your passport is probably very impressive.
1090082	1094503	I got to wonder, how do you select the places that you're going to go?
1094644	1098305	How do you decide, we're going to do this in Asia, or we're going to go to Portugal?
1098625	1100005	How do you pick where you're going?
1100700	1101641	It's a great question.
1102182	1103783	A number of different ways, actually.
1104324	1113394	We've now grown to a point where people are now knocking our doors down, trying to get us.
1114314	1115556	The people in China...
1116112	1117593	Contacted us.
1118993	1124456	We're doing Beijing and Hong Kong, multiple dates.
1124476	1127357	The people from Singapore contacted us.
1128218	1128898	It's a great thing.
1128918	1138083	In terms of all the places in the United States, we had a really important show at the end of April where it was our debut on Broadway in New York City.
1139443	1143105	A very important thing for any actor performance is
1143405	1148569	and we sold out the show three months in advance and so that was a huge accomplishment.
1148669	1156975	What that does is that sends messages to all of the other promoters and cities and symphonies and buyers of this material.
1157596	1162720	It sends out a strong message and so they start knocking down our doors so at this point for us
1163360	1176610	All we're trying to do is take all of these things and make some kind of sensible routing or sensible order and figuring out, okay, which ones do we pick?
1177110	1183454	For example, if the San Diego Symphony contacts us, oh, hey, let's do it during Comic-Con in San Diego.
1184235	1186396	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1208827	1215649	I would like to get a petition going to bring video games live to Taiwan.
1215669	1218750	It would be the very first video game concert ever in Taiwan.
1219891	1223572	She asked if she could use our logo and things.
1224291	1225532	to start a petition.
1225572	1227873	She wanted to make up flyers and pass them out.
1227913	1229374	I said, sure, absolutely.
1229574	1232756	I thought it was kind of cool and adorable.
1235038	1243923	Two weeks later, she contacts me and she has an Excel spreadsheet and a link that I could follow.
1244563	1247005	She says, hey, look, been working really hard.
1247305	1247826	www.DarkSakura.com
1267904	1268705	www.DarkSakura.com
1289500	1290600	Dave Matthews Vans
1317403	1322224	might be super popular in America and they might sell out 20,000 seat stadiums.
1322724	1325665	But when they go to Germany, maybe not so much.
1325985	1328826	Or when they go to Spain, no one knows who they are.
1328906	1331286	Or Korea, no one's heard of them, right?
1331526	1332547	And the reverse is true.
1333107	1336828	European bands try to break you here all the time and people have no idea who they are.
1336868	1337928	They just never really catch on.
1338562	1340865	Exactly, and the same with Japan as well.
1341166	1345351	Whereas video games, music, what a universal thing.
1345411	1347955	Now, although the game popularity might
1348305	1350486	might change from region to region.
1351126	1352487	Like in the U.S.
1352607	1368693	here, we might play Halo as our big grand finale, but maybe down in Brazil, where the PlayStation is a lot more predominant and not so many Xboxes, maybe a game like Castlevania or Nintendo is big down there as well.
1368733	1371674	So maybe it's Mario or Castlevania down in Brazil.
1371774	1371934	And so...
1373895	1375657	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1391650	1392371	and many more.
1415547	1416388	www.DarkSakura.com
1443724	1448306	than I've seen and experienced in other parts of the world.
1449166	1453927	Even down in Mexico, we played a smaller town in Mexico a couple months ago.
1454207	1455828	It was at the end of March.
1456508	1461070	We played a 7,000-seat bullring in Mexico, Mexicali, Mexico.
1461110	1465651	It wasn't Mexico City, which is the biggest city in the world, which people may not be aware of.
1465931	1466472	Thanks for watching!
1481427	1484708	There were 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 gamers who showed up.
1484908	1486408	You know what's funny, Tommy?
1486828	1492730	One of those people that were there at that concert in Mexicali actually called us that next weekend.
1493230	1493730	Oh, really?
1493890	1497831	Yes, he's one of our listeners, Actdeft, and he said he had a great time at the show, can't wait to go back.
1498171	1501852	And that was going to kind of lead into my next question, which I think you might have already answered.
1502132	1512197	Talk about the girl from Taipei, but if there's somebody who wants this event to come to their city or come back to their city, what do you think is the best way for them to go about doing this?
1512477	1518701	I don't know if you want to get a petition from every city, but what do you think would be the best way for somebody to get this back to their town?
1519141	1525084	We actually put this in the FAQ on our website as well because we get asked that same question by so many people.
1526805	1534409	and the other question that's asked a lot is how do you pick which music to play for different cities or countries that you go to?
1534489	1537251	So it's really a two-part answer.
1538311	1543054	The first question is we have a mailing list on the front page.
1543214	1545776	It's Video Games Live mailing list and we don't spam people.
1545816	1554561	We send out something maybe once every couple of months or if it's coming to your area, we'll geotarget your area to let you know that
1554961	1555902	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1572942	1585173	for that area so I can geo-target like a 200 mile radius around the city that we're going to and it will show me out of all the people who signed up for the mailing list what they want to hear most.
1585293	1588156	So, you know, each show we do we have our
1588556	1588976	and so on.
1608094	1612159	Then when you start to, we play about 20 segments in an evening.
1612179	1615002	That constitutes about a two and a half hour presentation.
1615502	1629497	So, you know, so one night we might, you know, if we're in France, for example, and, you know, the game Beyond Good and Evil was created by my good friend Michelle Ancel at Ubisoft in France, we're going to play
1630297	1630578	and so on.
1653536	1666011	Yeah, you know, we have, you know, in Asia, you know, stuff like StarCraft II and WarCraft, and StarCraft II hasn't even come out, but we're still, we're already playing the music and the video.
1666472	1671138	And games like WarCraft and StarCraft are super huge over in Asia.
1672359	1680182	But not so much down in Brazil, because a lot of people are less about PC gaming and more about Nintendo and Sony.
1680242	1685363	So down in Brazil, stuff like Metroid and Castlevania is huge down there.
1685463	1692465	So we vary, but we really listen to the fans from that area to decide.
1692886	1693826	And if people want to...
1694446	1696549	bring our show to their city.
1696810	1707024	We also have an email address info at videogameslive.com and we collect all those emails and normally someone will get back to you within 24 hours.
1707788	1708888	Alright, excellent.
1709129	1715251	I hope not only Actdeft, but all of our listeners who are hoping to get video games live in their backyard are successful with that.
1716532	1719093	Speaking of listeners going to this show, I have to bring this up.
1719133	1721073	This might be a little silly, but I gotta ask it.
1721213	1721814	It's kind of funny.
1722554	1728156	One of our listeners, DJ Jani, wrote us on a previous show, and he was talking about the Video Games Live tour stop in Las Vegas.
1728576	1736900	Raved about the show, said he had a great time, but one part that kind of cracked me up is he specifically mentioned that you change outfits quite a bit during the show.
1736980	1737180	Are you...
1737640	1741921	Are you coordinating your wardrobe to match the games, or what's up?
1741961	1745202	I'll tell you exactly, and I'll explain it, and it's, again, a great question.
1745222	1747223	Yeah, I'm Cher up in this motherfucker.
1747263	1749023	No, I'm like Cher.
1749043	1749944	I've got to change everyone.
1749984	1751524	Madonna, you know, Britney.
1751584	1754705	No, there's three times.
1754765	1757566	I have a two-and-a-half-hour performance.
1757626	1761027	I host the show, of course, as I mentioned, and...
1761927	1766050	I want to be respectful to the symphony and the people on stage.
1766650	1771353	But by the same token, I've been a video game composer for 18 years.
1771453	1780379	So I might come out in an Armani suit, but I might be wearing Nike sneakers and a Spider-Man shirt underneath or a Mickey Mouse shirt underneath or whatever.
1780399	1783981	So I don't know what you'd call it.
1784481	1788183	Casual whatever.
1788263	1788604	I don't know.
1789224	1790485	Casual tux or something.
1790505	1790785	I don't know.
1791226	1793888	But at the beginning, I kind of do that.
1794128	1801614	And then we have a 20-minute intermission, and I come back, and now the shirt's on buttons.
1801674	1805436	The coattails might be off.
1805476	1807658	We're going to turn down the lights a little bit for this segment.
1808899	1818166	And then at the end, I come out with a guitar, and it would look silly of me to be wearing a suit and playing guitar, so...
1819008	1820208	by The Encore.
1820368	1825069	I'm kind of in, you know, a little bit more rock and roll gear, if you will.
1825289	1828430	And so, yeah, so I changed three times.
1828750	1833371	Once at the beginning to be kind of more formal, and then it kind of evolves into not so formal.
1833651	1833871	All right.
1833891	1834732	Well, that makes sense.
1834772	1836392	Thank you for helping to explain that.
1836432	1836732	All right.
1837172	1838993	It was a very important question about being in his life.
1839013	1839613	No worries.
1839653	1840093	No worries.
1841115	1843359	This really is an important question about Video Games Live.
1843439	1846746	A lot of people are wondering, is there a CD at some point in the future?
1846866	1848810	Some type of digital distribution?
1848991	1849692	iTunes?
1850013	1850534	Question mark?
1851517	1852818	Absolutely.
1853258	1856320	In fact, it's something that was supposed to come out last fall.
1857581	1871649	The record company made the decision that they didn't want it to come out during Christmas season because they didn't want it to get lost in all the great games that always come out around that time.
1872153	1876895	So then we're going to delay it to the first quarter of this year.
1876955	1882238	You know, we're thinking, oh, maybe come out like around, you know, February or March instead.
1882778	1885059	After all the Christmas hype had subsided.
1885539	1889201	But then we're working on some new great pieces.
1889321	1893523	At the time I was working on, because a lot of people also, they email us.
1893871	1895612	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1923943	1944365	and so I was working on this Castlevania thing and I was just like man I really want to get this on the album so I asked EMI who's one of the biggest record companies in the world who's putting the album out I kind of begged and pleaded I said hey can we
1944875	1946116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1967830	1997302	I'm talking about all over Europe all over Asia it's the first time ever that a video game compilation album is being released by a major record company around the world it's never happened before and the licensing if you can imagine the licensing you know going through companies like Halo and I mean Microsoft for Halo and Ubisoft for Myst and you know Konami for Castlevania I mean it got to be you know it was a bit of a
1998041	2001862	Nightmare at first because no one had ever really done anything like this before.
2002102	2003142	Same thing we encountered.
2003162	2010024	That's why it took us three years to get the first concert in order because no one had ever done it to the scale and size that we were doing.
2011324	2013164	It's going to be released all over the world.
2013584	2018225	July 22nd is the release date here in America, which we're coinciding.
2019346	2020966	Another reason we wanted to delay it
2021206	2021947	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2043850	2047554	Outside Show, San Diego Symphony, so many special guests.
2048234	2052198	But we're also having synchronized fireworks as well for that show.
2052498	2057943	And so this is all in celebration as well of our album being released that week.
2057983	2061527	So we wanted to wait for something big, and that was the one.
2061887	2065050	In terms of our European release, we're going to do that.
2065090	2068974	We're playing a 7,000-seat stadium in Leipzig.
2069014	2070215	It's the Leipzig Arena.
2070995	2074616	Right there during the Games Convention in August.
2074656	2078937	So we're going to wait to release the album in August in Europe.
2079037	2083519	Have it be around a big press and marketing event and things like that.
2083719	2090601	And then in Asia, we're going to be releasing it right around the time of the Olympics where we're playing in Taipei in the beginning of August.
2091001	2095742	And that's when we're going to do the big release there, the very first video game concert ever in Asia.
2095902	2096563	China, Taiwan, etc.
2120799	2121319	Very cool.
2121379	2131643	And we here at OLR, I think we can all agree we're very comfortable with you delaying the CD to incorporate Castlevania because that game is incredible and the music is awesome.
2132483	2141366	It's like when Miyamoto – I worked with Miyamoto on Metroid Prime and I've known him for many years.
2141426	2144767	He's such a great guy and he once told me –
2146548	2147529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2172568	2179552	Don't you wish all game companies and game makers and game developers had that same sense about them?
2179892	2186376	Why is Halo Halo and Half-Life Half-Life and why any Miyamoto product is what it is?
2186777	2191379	It's because they refuse to let anything out that's not perfect.
2191680	2195582	Or the best it could possibly be at that time.
2195882	2196803	We feel the same way.
2196823	2198524	We don't want to just rush out an album and
2199133	2200274	We were making Castlevania.
2200294	2201775	It's like, man, I got to get this on.
2201815	2206317	It's a really popular track that we love to perform.
2206377	2207298	And you're absolutely right.
2207778	2211340	In gaming, a lot of people get very frustrated with these delays sometimes.
2211380	2211840	But you know what?
2211880	2213101	Sometimes it's for a good reason.
2213561	2220125	Well, you know the funny thing about that, too, is that you'll notice people will bitch and moan like crazy when it keeps getting delayed.
2220545	2224527	And then the second those games come out – I worked on Metroid Prime.
2224547	2227309	I think we were working on it for five freaking years or something –
2228111	2229013	with Miyamoto, right?
2230458	2235372	But the thing you'll notice though is when the game comes out and it's freaking perfect.
2236129	2237149	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2259355	2260697	Thank you for having me.
2275777	2276318	I remember that, Tommy.
2276338	2276919	I was in L.A.
2277039	2278421	and I wanted to go to the show.
2278441	2280344	I was stuck doing work.
2280824	2281425	I couldn't do it.
2281566	2282086	I was so mad.
2292361	2293502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2316399	2318840	Maybe just the theme from the very first game.
2318880	2323261	That really haunting little melody in the beginning and the kind of upbeat as it goes through.
2323341	2324421	Just the classic.
2325161	2325502	I don't know.
2325722	2328362	I'm kind of partial to the soundtrack for Silent Hill 4.
2328402	2329963	I don't know what my co-host would say about that.
2330003	2331023	I think they're all about Silent Hill 2.
2332103	2333084	You know the tough part?
2333144	2334004	You know the tough part?
2334024	2336905	It's something to think about too from my end is that
2338903	2349551	The music from Silent Hill is a perfect example where certain games, it's very hard to translate to a live performance, especially when you're talking about a symphony on stage.
2349631	2351892	Silent Hill is one of those games.
2352153	2356876	I'll tell you the other game that was very, very challenging and I didn't want to put in the show until I...
2357264	2357985	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2375672	2382901	What we did with Metroid is we decided to, let's try to create that beginning that everyone knows and loves so much.
2383201	2389549	Let's try to kind of recreate those electronics and bleeps and bloops with the symphony.
2390430	2393694	And add in the electronics, add in the original...
2394335	2409750	Sounds from the game and play those live with the symphony as well to kind of give it this really super duper retro feel because if you try to just do it with instruments, it sometimes doesn't translate, you know, so we're really happy with with
2410949	2419815	I can't wait to see it myself, hopefully in San Jose.
2420956	2425199	One thing, I want to kind of ask you about some of the other stuff outside of Video Games Live.
2425239	2427520	I know we're kind of longer than we anticipated in the beginning.
2427540	2427940	That's all right.
2427961	2428581	We're having a good time.
2428661	2431263	I want to ask you about some of your other stuff besides just Video Games Live.
2431283	2432544	Let me take another listener question here.
2433504	2440509	One of our listeners, DarkTetsuya, wanted to know, do you have a favorite piece that you've ever worked on for the video game music that you've composed?
2441290	2442491	Sure, yeah.
2442851	2444492	I'm going to go with two, actually.
2445433	2451897	The stuff that I did for Earthworm Jim is some of my favorite stuff.
2452098	2457241	And more so, not necessarily even from a composing standpoint, but from a...
2459042	2467506	Just a silliness standpoint in terms of like when we were working on Earthworm Jim, there was like 10 guys in a room all trying to make each other laugh.
2467946	2470648	That was Earthworm Jim.
2470708	2471968	That's what we did.
2471988	2473929	We had a year to make each other laugh.
2474249	2476470	And you totally can't tell from the way it turned out.
2476730	2478131	Yeah, right?
2478911	2484674	And so that was such a great experience and just doing it so, so differently.
2484714	2487035	Of course, that team had been together for a long time.
2487095	2487956	We worked on –
2488536	2489917	The original Terminator game.
2489957	2492220	We did Global Gladiators for the Genesis.
2492300	2493561	Then we did Cool Spot.
2493861	2495383	Then we did Disney's Aladdin.
2495423	2496744	And then we did Earthworm Jim 1 and 2.
2497224	2501068	And then MDK after that before everyone kind of started their own companies.
2501148	2504491	But that was such a great experience.
2504551	2510057	So I would say if I had a personal favorite, that would be it.
2510157	2512479	But in terms of composition, though...
2513760	2514681	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2536917	2547011	but I was really happy with the way the music composition turned out in that and it was something I've always wanted to do my whole life and so I really put my heart and soul into that score.
2547291	2551177	Well, hopefully people will get a second chance to check that out if it ever makes its way to the Xbox Originals.
2552018	2552619	Yeah, there you go.
2552879	2555222	Game Audio Network Guild or GANG What's GANG up to this year?
2571001	2585470	Well, the biggest thing, the biggest thing that the gang has just done last week, in fact, was launched the version 3.0 of our website, which is a complete networking mass.
2585550	2589473	I mean, it really, you know, the third word in gang, network, right?
2589513	2591614	The Game Audio Network Guild.
2592194	2596219	This was always our dream to have this kind of portal and website available.
2596499	2612738	I mean, think of like, you know, MySpace meets, you know, the Game Developers Association, you know, or the IGDA or, you know, Gamasutra.com or any of those great websites out there.
2615040	2618803	Networking is so important in our industry.
2618883	2633734	When I talk to people about people trying to get in the industry or give speeches at schools or whatever, I always say that the creative aspect of what you do is only about 50% of it.
2633754	2634535	The other 50% is networking.
2634555	2635095	I say that to any...
2642381	2643021	Musician.
2643081	2662458	Instead of practicing piano for 10 hours a day, if you practice that for 5 hours a day and then you take the other 5 hours and use that to network and to get to know people or to send emails or to help better yourself or your personality or whatever.
2662638	2663179	People have to
2663905	2664465	www.DarkSakura.com
2680937	2681397	and many more.
2698228	2699969	Game Audio Curriculum for Colleges and Universities
2725573	2735333	And by the way, some of these colleges and universities are places like Berklee School of Music in Boston, places like UCLA and USC.
2735393	2737437	I mean, some of the finest schools in the world.
2738327	2749792	and even some specialized colleges, accredited colleges, you know, places like Full Sail in Florida, for example, or Guild Hall in Texas or Expressions in San Francisco.
2749892	2765179	So, you know, working, it's been a passion of mine from the beginning to really, you know, help the game audio industry have more respect and to educate not only each other as composers and sound designers but
2765404	2768626	But also to educate the developers and the publishers as well.
2768646	2773549	Because when I first got in this industry almost 20 years ago, they didn't care.
2773629	2776350	They didn't give a crap about video game audio.
2776410	2786296	It was so like – I mean a typical day in the office back in the early 90s would be somebody walking in my office saying, okay –
2787608	2798936	The game's done, we don't have any music, we don't have any money or budget, we don't have any space left on the cartridge, and oh yeah, we gotta submit this in two days, so we don't have any time either.
2799366	2799886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2821531	2823795	and music go through the roof.
2823835	2827722	And that's not just because of the technology.
2827902	2834914	Gang should take a lot of credit for that, for educating all those things, for educating them about
2835253	2835453	5.1 Audio
2856848	2860711	Sound designers and composers to do what we need to do.
2860751	2865574	These are all things that gang does on a constant basis behind the scenes.
2865855	2880605	Some of our sponsors are EA and Dolby and some of these colleges and schools and THX and all these DTS and all these amazing companies, Microsoft and Intel and AMD and
2881862	2895281	Chip manufacturers and things so everybody believes in the message it was just a matter of everyone banding together to get that and coming together as one to get that message out there as a group of people and that's really
2895886	2903291	And of course we have our gang awards as well each year where we have about 25 different categories.
2903331	2913097	Everything from best sound design of the year to best music of the year or best song written for a video game, best licensed music for a game.
2913597	2918000	There's best cinematic sound in a game, so there's all sorts of different categories.
2918260	2918600	AudioGang.org
2942677	2945018	All right, well, Tommy, I got one more question for you.
2945178	2947979	And thank you so much for spending the time here with us tonight.
2948619	2951300	But we always ask this, all of our guests we bring on the program.
2951640	2953300	It's the way we start off our show every week.
2953320	2958562	We always talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games we've been playing this week and what we've been enjoying.
2958622	2960622	So, Tommy, how was your gaming week?
2960642	2962063	What kind of video games you've been into lately?
2962963	2963703	Fantastic.
2963723	2968285	You know, it's funny because yesterday I played.
2969025	2969546	Father's Day, Buzz,
2985089	2985890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3010687	3012869	I played a little rock band this week.
3013950	3020894	But also, this might get people a little jealous, I've been playing Metal Gear Solid 4, of course.
3021154	3022715	I've been playing that for a couple weeks.
3024915	3026036	Guitar Hero Aerosmith
3041701	3045582	Which hasn't hit the shelves yet, but I've been playing a lot of that lately as well.
3045982	3048582	So something Guitar Hero related is coming to Video Games Live.
3049283	3054884	An interactive segment with Guitar Hero and Stephen Tyler from Aerosmith.
3054924	3057144	His real name is Stephen Tallarico.
3057184	3058144	He's my cousin.
3059705	3070307	We've been always talking about doing something together and ended up getting them hooked up with Activision to get that product on the market the first time ever.
3071147	3097528	A band has its own music video game with Guitar Hero, so we're all really proud of that Wouldn't it be cool if somebody could come up on stage and play a song from Guitar Hero Aerosmith While playing along on the big screen with the orchestra And with some live musicians on stage as well, wouldn't that be cool?
3097776	3106503	That would be awesome, and thankfully it's Aerosmith and not that Dragon Force song from Guitar Hero 3, because then I'd be, I think we'd all like, you know, I would want to lose in front of all those people.
3107244	3110366	Aerosmith I think I could probably handle, I know those songs pretty well.
3111807	3126299	Well, Tommy Tallarico, the man behind Video Games Live, the man behind Gang, and the soundtrack to so many video games, thank you so much for spending the time tonight here on Orange Launch Radio, talking about everything, and best of luck to you through the next few dates of your tour.
3127076	3144706	Thank you, and I really appreciate you taking the time to help spread the word because I think what you guys are doing are so important to us and the growth of this thing, and talking about it really helps us out in helping to spread the word.
3144766	3145667	So thank you.
3146187	3147168	No problem, Tommy.
3147208	3147848	Best of luck to you.
3148529	3149049	Okay, thanks.
3150560	3154761	Thank you so much to Tommy for taking the time to talk to us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3154841	3156002	It was a lot of fun.
3156162	3160783	He's pretty chatty, but a lot of really insightful information about how the whole process works.
3160903	3163804	And it's funny because I didn't believe it when he said it.
3165604	3168005	Steven Tyler's last name is actually Tallarico.
3168105	3170406	Yeah, I kind of thought it was a joke when I first heard it too.
3170426	3172446	That's why I didn't follow up on that at all.
3172526	3173587	But no, it is true.
3173627	3178048	He is actually related to Steven Tyler, which means he's also related to Liv Tyler.
3180754	3181414	Alright, anyhow.
3181854	3182174	Hey.
3182475	3182735	What?
3183955	3184855	So you can be related.
3185155	3186456	Yeah, it's just kind of neat.
3186636	3188437	I kind of thought he was joking.
3188497	3192058	Like, oh yeah, he's my bro, he's my cousin, you know, that type of thing.
3192078	3193678	I was just very surprised.
3193998	3198780	And it's so funny because, you know, Loki exclaims something like, if it's not on Wikipedia, it's not true.
3199120	3201161	And then he went to Wikipedia and I just heard, oh.
3202581	3203361	I guess it is true.
3206269	3208791	All right, anyhow, we got some more gaming news to cover.
3208831	3212295	I know you guys on Skype are eager to call in, so we want to get to you guys as well.
3212315	3214136	We have a few more stories for you guys quick, though.
3214296	3215077	We'll start off with Loki.
3215357	3218040	Okay, well, last week, you know, the PSP got firmware 4.0.
3218840	3231392	Well, of course, they couldn't leave it just like that, so they put out 4.01, which, you know, is just, I guess, to make sure that 4.0 was working correctly and updates as far as...
3233133	3236174	They improved some of the search features, I guess.
3236954	3237595	That's about it.
3237995	3246037	Well, I don't know if they were trying to stop the homebrew stuff, but pretty much the very next day, the custom firmware 4.01 was released.
3246158	3249899	Yeah, PKJr92 in chat says, 4.01 is a joke.
3249939	3250879	Just like 9-1-1 is a joke.
3250899	3251359	4.01 is a joke.
3251379	3253500	Maybe that could be a hit new song.
3263603	3264684	4.01 is a joke.
3266605	3267305	Not a joke.
3267385	3271547	The whole annoying digital rights management thing on the Xbox Live.
3271587	3272067	Guess what?
3272107	3274428	They have finally fixed it.
3275048	3282091	There is a new DRM tool, digital rights management tool, that is available on Xbox site, on the Microsoft site.
3283752	3288616	This is originally going to be a part of the next patch or the next release, but it's actually available now.
3288656	3290117	It's available on Xbox.com.
3290678	3295282	You can manage the digital rights contents of arcade titles that you've downloaded and so on.
3295702	3300546	I haven't used this myself, but I should because my original Xbox 360 died of the Red Rings of Death.
3300886	3306328	So I have this awkward digital management thing with Geometry Wars and Joust, which were the first two arcade titles I ever bought.
3306648	3307968	So I should go in and try to fix that.
3308528	3312449	So now you don't have to go through this whole mess of getting the points credited back to you and all this stuff.
3313130	3314990	In fact, you can see the three-step process here.
3315370	3318251	Make sure you've signed into Xbox Live with this account, or whatever your name is.
3318611	3321952	Go to the Xbox Live Marketplace and select Account Management, Download History.
3322332	3324333	Select an item and then select Download Again.
3324713	3327394	Repeat Step 3 for each item in your download history.
3328703	3328923	I win.
3328943	3329964	What did you win?
3330004	3330325	I win a story.
3330345	3331226	And what would this story be about?
3352006	3359652	Well, everyone knows that one of the coolest voice actors in the world, in my opinion anyway, is David Hayter.
3359712	3364777	He has written movies, done a fairly good job with the first X-Men movie.
3365097	3368340	Actually, with the first two X-Men movies since he did the screenplays.
3369621	3376967	But he is actually looking for a petition out to get all of the fans to sign so that he writes the Metal Gear movie.
3378590	3379351	Interesting.
3379571	3387335	Well, honestly, I would have to think that he would know Snake better than just about anybody except maybe Kojima.
3387455	3390817	Or some of the other people on Kojima's team.
3391197	3403525	But I think, though, that when you're the person who puts the personality into the character, I think that you would have a bit of insight into how to properly write for that character.
3403625	3405406	So I think it's pretty cool.
3409599	3411662	What kind of writing creds does he have?
3414184	3418990	He wrote the screenplays for the first two X-Men movies.
3419770	3421753	He's doing an adaptation of Watchmen.
3424663	3434189	But he's actually looking to have everyone actually email a rep at Sony Pictures.
3435190	3439893	The address is, and I'm going to go ahead and say it on the air because honestly I would love for him to write the movie.
3439913	3441434	He does a good job.
3442115	3450260	But it's Matt, M-A-T-T underscore T-O-L-M-A-C-H at S-P-E dot Sony dot com.
3451161	3452662	So send those emails in.
3452762	3454402	And actually use good grammar, please.
3454442	3455803	Spell check for the win.
3456163	3459464	This is a really good opportunity for us to try and get David Hayter on the show.
3460205	3460725	I know.
3460845	3461385	I'm going to email.
3461405	3462265	I'm going to see if I can get an email.
3462285	3464946	You realize I'm going to be sitting in the corner fangasming the whole time.
3465887	3466707	Fanning yourself.
3466727	3467827	He's actually really good looking, too.
3467847	3469068	We'll have to see what we can do about that.
3469828	3476511	In a reference to the video that we saw the other day, and no one else will get, Blurred Fluids.
3477907	3479628	Nobody's going to understand that.
3480429	3481109	YouTube joke.
3482611	3483531	What was I going to say here?
3483932	3485453	Some comments here in the chat room.
3485953	3488335	DJ Dark Knight says as long as he plays him.
3491135	3491635	You never know.
3515925	3542758	but iTunes has a similar policy I think you can reset your iTunes digital rights management like once a year as well but of course then again you can also install the music on like four different computers something like that awesome well remember there was a big to do about the whole hot coffee crap in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and then there was a settlement where people could possibly get money for not even having purchased Grand Theft Auto but you know
3543424	3545445	You just have to pretend that you did.
3545965	3549547	Well, the response to the whole thing was really only 2,676 claims.
3549567	3550087	You didn't say 26,000, right?
3550107	3550307	You said 2,000.
3550347	3550307	2,676.
3550407	3553129	And how many people bought Grand Theft Auto?
3553149	3553629	Approximately 12 million.
3553649	3553809	11 billion?
3562213	3573486	So that apparently is approximately 0.022% of the consumers that actually were offended and upset from the content in the game.
3573526	3577411	In other words, people looking for a free lunch, courtesy of Take-Two from McDonald's.
3577431	3578392	And essentially that...
3578852	3579353	That's funny.
3579393	3579993	Wow, just wow.
3602089	3605332	If I had the stupid award music still queued, I'd probably play it right about now.
3605372	3610816	But unfortunately, I left that in Part A. Everyone was complaining that it was such a big deal and everyone was making a big deal.
3611056	3614759	You know who that .22% or .022% was?
3614899	3616160	Jack Thompson and his family.
3616741	3619042	And just people blowing the shit out of proportion.
3619062	3620544	People wanted to see if it worked or not.
3621244	3624627	Seriously, out of those 2,000, how many just wanted to see if it would work?
3625648	3626588	That's what I'm curious about.
3626608	3627249	If they got money.
3627429	3628850	Did anybody in our chat room do it?
3629591	3630051	Probably not.
3630683	3633244	Einhander and Xenogears are now going to be on the PlayStation Network.
3633264	3634025	I like Einhander.
3634045	3634705	We still need Zweihander.
3657896	3661860	I'm surprised Xenogears is on there since I think it's a multiple disc game.
3662240	3666544	Well, hey, you know, they've got a lot of storage space on that PlayStation 3, you know.
3667805	3670208	So anyhow, you can now download these songs.
3670248	3672410	You can download these games on the PlayStation Network.
3672950	3674051	And there you have it.
3674432	3676354	They're being sold right now in Japan.
3676454	3677214	Sorry, you can't do it here.
3677274	3678756	It's being sold for 600 yen apiece.
3679076	3679396	That's about $5.56.
3679476	3679737	Not bad.
3682284	3682904	Money Talks, people.
3682924	3683185	Money Talks.
3706001	3706781	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
3706801	3707902	Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?
3707962	3708262	Hello!
3736380	3737180	Hey everyone!
3737420	3738621	I know what you were doing last night.
3739501	3741562	I know what you were doing last night too, tell us about it.
3742783	3743883	I know what you did last night.
3745324	3748025	Well, besides getting drunk with Freeze Pop.
3749405	3755608	Wait, so when you say that, you don't mean you were actually getting drunk at a Freeze Pop concert, although that is probably true as well.
3755948	3758469	You actually went out and got drunk with Freeze Pop the band.
3759400	3761020	Yes, this is what actually happened.
3761040	3761621	Please tell the story.
3761641	3772883	I was at a room party having a good time, and I left, you know, to bring some more alcohol up, and I was going up the stairs, and I saw them, and the girl, I think her name was Elizabeth, she said, is there a party going on?
3772903	3774484	I'm like, yeah, follow me.
3775744	3783346	Follow me right into the party, and we've been partying ever since, and right now I'm actually downloading all the pictures from the party with them as we speak.
3784206	3786367	Did you remind them that OLR loves them muchly?
3787745	3789141	Yes I did, in between shots.
3789343	3789606	Nice.
3791657	3792798	I doubt they even remember us.
3792858	3794878	Only one of them came on the show, but you never know.
3795999	3797279	That's where you just list?
3797299	3798099	The whole band or what?
3798500	3799220	The whole band.
3799320	3800060	That's awesome.
3800620	3801381	So there you have it.
3801441	3802521	Doing shots with the band.
3802741	3806062	Did they happen to let slip any things they might have coming up in the game world?
3806282	3808603	You know, I read recently one of their emails that went out to everybody.
3808623	3814625	There was a little bit of freeze pop controversy about the fact that their song I Am Not Your Game Boy is on Guitar Hero DS.
3815426	3818267	Because it's actually not by Harmonix anymore, right?
3818687	3818947	And so
3819267	3822548	They wanted to kind of clear the air that, hey, they're loaning their songs out to, you know.
3822908	3829430	Or, no, the deal was that, I think if I remember right reading on their site, they don't get paid when they're in the Harmonix games.
3830170	3832790	They do it just, you know, for the love of Harmonix, for the love of those games.
3832830	3841533	But they were getting paid by Konami when it was in DDR, by Sony, you know, branded games, and by, you know, the folks who did Guitar Hero on tour.
3844113	3846614	Yeah, a little freeze-pop controversy I thought I'd clear up.
3847383	3848703	Well, they really are talented.
3848763	3851825	I mean, after seeing them a second time, it was really awesome.
3851845	3856066	They really deserve more, you know what I'm saying?
3856186	3858387	Yeah, they're destined for stardom eventually.
3859787	3862608	Everybody knows some of their songs from Rock Band and all that stuff.
3863249	3867110	Well, they did a new song at the concert.
3867310	3867650	Oh, really?
3868610	3872272	Yeah, they covered a popular song from the 80s as an encore song.
3872332	3872792	What was it?
3873632	3874713	The Final Countdown.
3874993	3875433	Nice!
3878339	3879802	That's definitely keytar friendly.
3882062	3882482	Definitely.
3882522	3883563	Hey, you never know.
3883643	3884564	Rock Band 2, maybe?
3884684	3885044	Who knows?
3886605	3887466	Hey, here's the thing, though.
3887506	3894170	Next time you go drinking with Liz, since now you have her number in your black book or whatever, tell them that OLR would love a new theme song.
3894450	3899614	No disrespect to Middie Head, but we've been using the opening song now for like two years, so we're looking for something new.
3900875	3901355	Just a thought.
3902396	3903597	I may be able to do something.
3903637	3906939	I know somebody that knows somebody, so I may be able to cash in a favor or something.
3906959	3907840	Oh, I would love you forever.
3907860	3909321	All right, what else is going on in your world?
3909361	3911242	Anything else you want to update our listeners on real quick?
3912967	3914688	Well, are you ready to drink this weekend?
3914868	3916188	Oh my god, that's right, you're coming to town.
3916228	3917149	No, I can't drink.
3917209	3918849	I can drink cider and milk.
3918949	3920510	Okay, I'll drink cider with you.
3920590	3923391	Okay, your cider will probably be special cider.
3924111	3927513	We'll get the Blackthorn for us.
3929713	3935296	No, I'm looking forward to you being in town, and I'm looking forward to the Fourth of July party when we're going to set things on fire.
3935756	3936036	Yes!
3937574	3938094	Oh yeah, Rob.
3938355	3938555	Yes.
3939496	3940537	I have a surprise for you.
3940877	3941938	Yay, I like surprises.
3942619	3945221	I'm going to present it next week if I can be on the show.
3945761	3946642	Of course you can be on the show.
3946662	3947923	I thought you were already coming to the show.
3948964	3950506	Just wanted to make sure, you know.
3950986	3953048	So Ranma will be here in studio next week.
3954318	3957501	All right, so until then, I'm hanging up on you because you have all next week to talk to us.
3958282	3958883	All right, then.
3959123	3960544	Later, Ranma.
3961626	3962046	Later.
3962066	3963347	That is next week, isn't it?
3963387	3964308	God, time flies.
3964569	3968132	That means I have to do... I'm going to be busy this week.
3968152	3969334	It's time to clean the house.
3970815	3973238	Well, I already... My house is pretty clean.
3973298	3974939	I just got to change the cat litter.
3975480	3976421	You okay over there, Loki?
3977517	3979859	Sorry, I'm just frustrated getting this working.
3980359	3980980	I heard myself.
3981740	3982761	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3982781	3983161	Who's this?
3983982	3984683	It's J-Rod.
3984883	3985443	Hey, J-Rod.
3985463	3986104	What's on your mind, buddy?
3986984	3991508	I'm just asking you guys, what are you looking forward to for E3 the most?
3991768	3992709	It's right around the corner.
3993194	3994615	What am I looking forward to E3 the most?
3994655	3999839	You know, me personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how much of Microsoft's press conference really did get spoiled.
3999979	4000599	Yeah.
4000839	4002420	I'm looking forward to all the press conferences.
4002480	4005702	I love sitting there not working and reading the press conferences.
4006103	4010546	I really am looking forward to seeing if Animal Crossing MMO or Wii or whatever.
4010666	4015389	I'm looking forward to seeing if it is true that Animal Crossing is coming back to Nintendo and what they're doing with it.
4015969	4043749	I'm so freaking curious it's killing me and of course I want Nintendo to address the space issues so I gotta say Nintendo's press conference I'm definitely looking forward to Sony I don't know what I'm looking forward to hearing from Sony but sometimes they really surprise you out of left field so I don't think you can predict Sony Microsoft if the rumors are true they're gonna have an interesting press conference ahead of them I'm also looking forward to seeing how the absence of these companies is gonna play into the E3 reports this year with all these companies dropping out
4044833	4046434	Loki, DarkSakura, anything you want to add?
4046654	4054179	No, they'll just have pretty much Activision, so since they're not going to be there, they'll probably have their own little press conference that'll take place at the same time.
4054860	4056621	I mean, it'll pretty much be the same damn coverage.
4057161	4057622	Yeah, true.
4058522	4061705	I still think that they made a mistake with cutting out the fanfare.
4061745	4064667	I just think that they should have been a bit more discerning as to invitations.
4064707	4065107	That's all.
4065501	4069842	Very disappointing, but have you looked at the Penny Arcade exhibitor list?
4069862	4071163	Now that I'm happy about.
4071983	4072803	That's doing it right.
4072823	4074764	You want to hear something that really would piss you off?
4074784	4079806	Okay, so my company got one invite to E3, and they said, oh, forget it, we're not going.
4080086	4081106	I'm like, you fuckers.
4081466	4083227	I'm like, you fucking whores.
4084676	4086657	Okay, J-Rod, I'm turning the tables a little bit.
4086697	4088258	What are you looking forward to seeing at E3?
4088718	4091659	I am looking forward to Gears of War 2.
4091719	4098683	That is my main game for this year, is Gears of War 2, and I want to see how the new Silent Hill is turning out.
4098723	4100223	I'm kind of iffy about that one.
4100423	4107627	Apparently, and I haven't seen this myself, but a buddy was telling me about this, that apparently the first 10 minutes of the game are out there on the internet, and it looks pretty good.
4108788	4110008	Oh, I don't want to spoil anything.
4110028	4111089	I'm going to have to pass on that.
4128681	4128921	All right.
4151371	4153211	All right, well, J-Rod, thanks so much for the call.
4153271	4154652	Anything else you want to share really quickly?
4154672	4155152	That's it.
4155352	4156212	All right, well, have a good one.
4156232	4157992	This phone call is brought to you by the Olive Garden.
4158212	4158932	All right.
4158992	4159773	Appreciate it.
4160053	4160873	Let's go to the Olive Garden.
4160913	4161933	I had Italian today.
4162193	4162533	Did you?
4162713	4164533	Yes, I had Mary's Pizza Shack.
4165334	4166854	I thought you couldn't have pizza.
4167174	4174015	Well, I can't, but they have pasta dishes there, and there was a pasta dish with marinara, because I can usually have light marinara pastas.
4174675	4175635	So it was good times.
4175996	4177056	All right, I better hang up on J-Rod.
4177196	4177516	Bye-bye.
4177816	4178316	Thank you very much.
4179724	4181766	Did you really want to hear us talk about Italian food the whole time?
4182206	4184348	Osfer says, I saw a trailer for the new Silent Hill.
4184408	4185590	It looked really scary.
4186370	4186991	I hope so.
4189453	4193497	There's not that many games I'm excited about right now, but that Silent Hill 5 is one of them.
4193517	4195739	And that game is supposed to be out sooner rather than later.
4195859	4197861	So we shall see very soon.
4198882	4199363	What do you guys think?
4199383	4200744	You want to do one more call?
4201164	4201845	One more quick call?
4201865	4202786	Sure.
4202806	4203086	All right.
4203727	4204608	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
4204628	4204948	Who's this?
4209195	4211076	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Sounds Radio.
4212876	4213157	Echo 1, 2, 3.
4213557	4215858	Is it that hard?
4217458	4217738	All right.
4219359	4219679	That's it.
4219699	4220759	We're closing the Skype line.
4223641	4225701	I can't deal with the lack of Echo 1, 2, 3 tonight.
4226422	4226742	All right.
4228142	4229103	I guess that's going to do it.
4229423	4230503	We're going to go around and wrap it up.
4231243	4232624	First, we've got to get some last-minute stories.
4232904	4233985	DarkSakura, you have a last-minute story?
4234045	4234965	I see you giggling over there.
4235632	4237434	I'm just in a giggle mood.
4237714	4237974	Why?
4238735	4239636	Because I am.
4239656	4240637	You can't be happy.
4240757	4241438	It's not allowed.
4241918	4244441	I can be as happy as I want to be, Rob.
4244761	4248305	And I'm going to whine so that you have to put up with it.
4248785	4249366	No, I don't.
4249546	4249946	Neener.
4250247	4251428	Loki, you have any last minute stories?
4251488	4252089	I did have a story.
4252949	4253290	You did?
4253570	4253950	Yes.
4254051	4255152	All right, then read it.
4255292	4256013	Stop your bitching.
4259515	4265459	This is a story that Sauce gave me like an hour ago or so.
4266160	4273284	That AppleCore has given the okay for a computer game to be released based on the Beatles.
4275326	4276967	Since they own the master recordings.
4277047	4277507	Really?
4278168	4278388	Yep.
4279008	4279709	Very interesting.
4281554	4287359	and they are trying to decide who's going to get it and they are between Activision and MTV Games.
4288240	4288981	Oh, snap.
4291603	4292504	Is that for real?
4293284	4294205	That is crazy.
4294385	4294766	All right.
4295106	4295566	We'll see.
4295706	4297068	Loki, have any last minute stories?
4297088	4299950	I don't know.
4301171	4302172	No, not really.
4302192	4302272	Okay.
4302717	4302977	Really?
4303017	4303297	Wow.
4303678	4306680	Yeah, well, I haven't been looking at last-minute stories.
4306700	4307701	I've been working on other stuff.
4308061	4308521	That's all right.
4308541	4314205	Apparently, Catwoman's going to be in Marvel vs. DC Universe, and she has a lot of cleavage, apparently.
4315326	4315807	Surprise.
4316867	4320890	Tigerclaw mentions in chatroom, by the way, Sky, you know that Bill Gates officially retired?
4321571	4321771	Yes.
4321871	4326795	But he'll still always be kind of like a mascot of sorts to that company, don't you think?
4327975	4329176	I mean, he's gone, but he's not.
4329417	4329857	You know what I mean?
4330419	4333842	Didn't he drop out of high school and start his own company?
4334722	4335543	Hey, you know what?
4335563	4336704	Just takes dedication.
4337164	4337725	Seriously.
4338145	4339006	Just takes dedication.
4339746	4340767	He dropped out of college.
4340807	4341227	That was it.
4341407	4341688	Yeah.
4342468	4343909	Well, so did I. And look at me.
4343969	4346231	I'm on the internet with a radio program with my friends.
4346331	4346771	Hey.
4347652	4348593	Winners don't use drugs.
4349033	4349333	All right.
4349674	4351895	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4352335	4353717	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
4354797	4356679	I fucking hate PHP.
4358853	4371181	Um, my final thought is I really want another piece of ice cream cake because the one I cheated with on my birthday and had was really, really, really fucking good.
4372222	4373523	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
4374003	4376064	I really want some creme brulee right now.
4376084	4378086	Oh my fucking god, creme brulee is the shit.
4378506	4381828	I'm gonna go get some creme brulee ice cream, I think.
4382242	4384964	Since we are Orange Lounge Foodio, I have to mention real quick.
4384984	4386745	This is our first mention of food tonight.
4387546	4388046	Olive Garden.
4388146	4389247	Yeah, we did have Olive Garden.
4389267	4389647	Here's the thing.
4389948	4392750	Did you know that Claim Jumper now has a healthy menu?
4393010	4393470	Do they?
4393510	4396112	Food under 600 calories a dish or something?
4396272	4397353	Under 600 calories a dish.
4397393	4398974	Half a day food, right?
4398994	4401015	For them, that's really good.
4401956	4404198	A bowl of soup and some of their garlic toast is under 600.
4404398	4408321	Yeah, but now they have salads and stuff that are really good and under 600 calories.
4408361	4408461	Yeah.
4410865	4411626	What was I going to say?
4411886	4412666	I don't know, but they're really good.
4412706	4413707	Oh, they have the creme brulee.
4413767	4417149	They have like a new dessert dish that's three of different flavors of creme brulee.
4417409	4418830	Like the green tea and all that stuff.
4419211	4420091	And the little tiny dishes.
4420111	4420452	Do you want?
4420472	4421512	Oh my god, so.
4421632	4423013	I do kind of want, actually.
4423434	4426516	Although, I probably should be good after massively cheating on my birthday.
4426956	4428037	Because I don't want to die.
4428417	4432280	This isn't really a last minute story, but it's interesting nonetheless.
4432760	4436743	But apparently there was a price drop on a cat skin for your Wii.
4437423	4440045	Yes, it's a cute little kitten that you can put on your Wii.
4442085	4443086	I will post it in chat
4472068	4474870	So I'm not DarkSakura.
4474890	4475790	She's DarkSakura.
4476211	4476951	I'm Rob Roberts.
4476971	4477631	He's Loki.
4478092	4479012	And that's the ferret.
4479172	4481294	And that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
4481314	4482394	We will see you next week.
4482474	4484335	Same bat time, same bat channel.
4484796	4485176	Good night.
4485976	4488677	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
