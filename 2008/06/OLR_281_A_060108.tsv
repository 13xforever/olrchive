13817	15040	Tonight, June 1st, 2008.
15981	18988	Could achievement like trophies be coming to PlayStation Network?
19168	21593	A homebrew version of Portal shows up on the DS.
22034	24900	And could a video game soon teach you to stop smoking?
31348	35693	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35733	43763	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and occasionally food.
44264	48870	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49520	50220	I had a hamburger.
51641	52842	It was delicious.
53082	54003	My husband cooked it.
54363	57325	He had Worcestershire sauce cooked into it.
58486	61668	Every time I hear Worcestershire sauce, I think of that one episode of South Park.
63857	64277	Forget it.
64377	64757	Forget it.
65178	67358	I watched the end of the Imaginationland episode.
67758	69239	That was kind of cool.
69259	71160	The Worcestershire sauce was like a long time ago.
71180	72020	I had to do with zombies.
72300	72540	Okay.
72720	73080	Forget it.
73420	73700	Anyway.
74901	75681	Is that like pink eye?
76101	76361	Sorry.
76901	80983	If the Worcestershire sauce has caused you to become a zombie, I don't remember what it was.
81003	82263	I just remember when they called the company.
82703	83003	Forget it.
83063	83303	Forget it.
83584	84764	My burger was great.
84904	85124	Okay.
85144	87345	I have to tell everybody about this because it was really delicious.
88165	90886	I had a wheat bun and a little bit of mayonnaise and I put garlic.
91827	97434	on the bun, like chopped garlic, and mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese.
98275	99457	And it was a delicious burger.
99497	100017	It was tasty.
100117	102601	I also have Guinness, but I don't think I like beer anymore.
103533	105595	Oh, that's... Well, Guinness isn't beer, thankfully.
105855	111019	But it's... I think that I've just lost my taste for a lot of alcoholic beverages.
111339	111659	Alright.
112200	112540	For now.
112780	114481	I had a good food week, too, yesterday.
115042	120266	You know, I've had to really eat a lot of very bland, low-fat food, thanks to the pancreas issues I had a couple weeks ago.
120826	126251	Whereas the bright side is I've lost almost 30 pounds now and haven't even had to play an ounce of Wii Fit.
127351	129513	The downside is I don't get to eat food I like.
129553	130434	But yesterday...
131074	135760	We were driving to the Bay and I got to go by one of my favorite places in the entire world, Mary's Pizza Shack.
136161	136802	I love that place.
137282	141868	And I actually ate like a pasta dish and the bread and I seem to be okay.
141888	142770	So I'm good.
142950	146935	I found something that I think that you might be able to partake of at California Pizza Kitchen.
147015	147416	Oh, what's that?
147896	156021	is that if you have them do light cheese on your pizza and get the wheat crust, you should be able to get away with pizza every now and again.
156321	159683	But you can make it yourself, and I will give you recipes, but not on the air.
160003	160283	All right.
161043	162824	Yes, because we do have video games to get to.
163365	165126	Also say hello to the other co-host, Loki.
165706	165946	Hello.
166126	167907	Three minutes into the show and I hadn't introduced you yet.
167927	169447	I'm so sorry, but food, Loki, food.
169548	170648	I'm so tired today.
170668	171368	Are you tired?
171568	172069	I don't know why.
172109	173489	I just feel all, like, drained.
173509	174529	Like, I have no energy.
174730	176170	Is it, like, lethargic, tired?
176210	176510	Yeah.
176530	179231	Like, I have a birthday coming soon.
179271	180352	I'm getting older.
180512	181932	No, I just, you know, exhausted.
181972	183473	I literally feel like I have no energy.
183533	183973	It's weird.
184233	184673	Ah, okay.
184874	189555	But speaking of food, I saw this thing on the Food Network, actually.
189615	190516	It's a local place.
190616	192677	It's a dive called the Squeeze In.
192737	193477	Have you ever heard of that?
194497	195698	I think I have, actually.
196059	203487	Well, they have a burger that's a third pound of beef with a third pound of cheese on it, and it's just huge.
204087	205068	I have to eat that.
207150	208572	That sounds like too much.
210013	210774	It literally is.
210914	214258	You have the patty, and then there's an extra inch of cheese around the outside.
214278	215479	Is that a knife and fork burger?
216480	216600	No.
216620	217321	Oh, all right.
218462	220184	All right, anyhow, look, enough food.
220644	229433	We've got to get to our gaming week, so I do want to introduce the ever-present other host on our show, you, the chatters, chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join our chat room.
229894	232957	Or, of course, you can wait until we open up the Skype line later in the show.
233017	235019	There's our mailbag that's already pretty full.
235379	236900	We'll see you next time.
257699	261901	I wanted to point out some comments in chat at chat.orangelongeradio.com.
262521	264642	Dark Tetsuya was expressing surprise.
264722	264982	What?
265062	266303	Jamie doesn't like beer anymore?
266503	266823	Wow.
268164	270085	It's not really so much that I don't like it.
270205	275767	It's just that I'll go ahead and say this right now.
275908	285252	The past couple of weeks, like I was telling you earlier today, I've been having digestion problems of my own and beer has been making me very pained.
285848	289029	Well, alcohol is just bad for your digestion system in general.
289329	289430	It is.
289470	289610	It is.
289630	290130	That's one thing.
290810	294292	I will probably not be able to drink alcohol for like a year if ever again.
294312	295652	I think I mentioned this on last week's show.
295712	296593	So, you know.
296793	297853	But it's not the end of the world.
297873	299954	I found I'm okay with like a little bit of wine.
301355	302195	But like.
303912	305773	DarkSakura's Poo in a few hours
331991	332471	Gross!
333532	342218	Well, that's the other reason I actually ate my cheeseburger is I'm experimenting with my food because I'm actually writing down everything I eat so I can see what hurts.
343218	345980	DarkSakura gave me that look of, why did you read that comment?
347421	355066	Geekboy2424 says that he just recently watched the YouTube video this week of Loki drunk playing Mario Kart.
355546	360549	Remember we have a YouTube channel and there's things like, that was you at your bachelor party quite some time ago playing Mario Kart drunk.
360589	360930	Good times.
360950	361110	Yes.
361650	364071	I'm hoping that we'll have more things on YouTube soon.
364471	366412	The bad news is that we have no webcam tonight.
366432	367333	There's no Justin TV.
367353	367853	Bad news?
367973	373155	The webcam broke, and so the audio doesn't work anymore.
373316	377457	And yeah, I can use the built-in speaker on the Mac, but listening to last week's show, it sucked.
377898	379158	So here's the thing, though.
379238	381479	I've picked out the video camera I want to get.
381819	388903	And the good news is that the video camera can also double as a webcam, but it can also be a video camera to go out and shoot more shenanigans.
389423	398992	You should get that one that they had at, what was it, at the lounge that All Games used to be in where they could control it and turn it and stuff.
399032	399813	No, it's not a webcam.
399853	401014	It's an actual video camera.
401435	403076	Remember, it's not porn unless you tape it.
404137	408261	Yeah, and then I can also start my amateur porn studio with my new video camera.
408321	408962	No, just kidding.
409322	410263	All right, okay.
411472	413715	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
427975	428315	Nice.
429416	430937	That story is for later, but anyway.
431918	440043	I've been trying to also, I've been getting on my husband because he's supposed to be getting me The World Ends With You, and every time he says he's gonna do it, oh, the store doesn't have it.
441344	444026	So you can't go to another?
444966	445807	Okay.
446788	448129	Then I'll have to suffer.
449489	450050	Evil man!
450350	451571	So The World Ends With Dan.
454873	455934	But, but, but, but, but.
456727	460129	I did have a really, really awesome game of World Cup Soccer Pinball.
461070	461250	Excellent.
461270	462591	And he's working on our Black Knight 2000!
463071	463611	I'm so happy!
463812	464092	Sweet.
464712	466293	You were telling me a funny story about Grand Theft Auto.
466313	467554	I don't know if you want to talk about it now or later.
467914	468154	Okay.
468274	468695	It's funny.
469675	470516	Okay.
470616	472057	I was watching Will play.
472397	474659	Will is Dan's, pretty much his best buddy.
474779	475159	BFF.
476998	484000	Anyway, I was watching him play right before I left, just like as I was leaving with my hamburger in hand.
485981	488462	He was ordering from Burger King in the game.
489682	490642	Burger Shot.
491023	492543	Or whatever the crap it is.
493043	493763	Burger Hell.
494664	496784	So we were talking about Falling Down, though.
496964	498765	You know that movie, what was it, Kurt Russell?
499639	500119	Michael Douglas
523584	527228	So, he gets his burger, holds out the gun, and she's like, oh shit.
527528	533494	Because, you know, they, I guess it's like, they instantly go into this panic, deer in the headlights look.
533554	537778	And I would too, I mean, I've had a gun pointed at my face before, so I know the thing.
537798	541101	And then he shoots her, and then like five other people pull up behind him and pull out guns.
541141	541381	It's like...
542462	555373	I'm leaving, bye and then he also made a motorcycle appear from nowhere and promptly crashed it and his friend landed on his head and we thought he died but he got up and I was like, your friend's really thick
557675	566023	So... Part of me does want to pick up Grand Theft Auto just for the lulz alone in situations like that, but I have this bad feeling it'll wear off quickly.
566204	567985	I get more amusement watching other people play it.
568025	571589	You guys have to remember, Grand Theft Auto is not usually my thing, you know?
572029	576193	But, I don't know, I guess I really should... I enjoyed watching Loki play it, so I should probably get it.
576754	577094	We'll see.
577234	578676	The multiplayer is probably fun, too.
580723	581104	Let's see.
581224	582987	What did somebody say in chat here?
583648	586853	Oh, SJ100Matt says, Jamie gets into her house by playing pinball.
586993	588035	Awesome security system.
588155	589417	Okay, okay, okay.
589457	589918	The story.
590539	590960	Real quick.
591761	593364	I got locked out of my house yesterday.
594774	596595	Okay, I have this little pouch on the side of my purse.
596615	598855	I put my keys in and my keys fell out.
598915	604897	So I get outside, shut the security door, make sure it's locked, and then realize when I'm reaching in my purse, I do not have my keys on me.
605537	607917	And Dan can't leave the store to come help me in.
608017	614359	And I can't get a hold of anybody who either A, has the keys to some part of my house, or can take me to go get Dan's.
615099	622001	So I'm going around the house and I found out that one of the screens actually didn't have the little protective tab in it, which we are going to remedy.
622641	637688	and I got the screen out, climbed up on this chair that we have outside for some unknown reason had to contort to freaking get in the window because I'm still too short and slid down a pinball machine the only window that I could get in was the one that Dan has the no fear pinball backed up against so I had to actually push it
638752	640614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
657299	657619	Alright.
658140	660562	Please do not be breaking into DarkSakura's house.
660582	661082	Okay, thanks.
661482	662383	No, because I'll kill you.
662743	662964	Alright.
663244	665005	Loki, how was your gaming week?
666687	668228	Well, I played more Grand Theft Auto 4.
668748	669249	Of course.
669689	671971	Well, I'm just working towards 100% stuff.
671991	673212	Did you shoot anyone in the face?
674033	675913	Yes, I'm pretty sure I did.
677774	681515	Anyways, so I finished all the pigeons.
681855	682755	I killed all the pigeons.
682895	684115	I did all the stunt jumps today.
685435	690116	And now I'm doing the random friends, I guess is what they call it.
690396	691777	But it's random people you meet on the street.
691817	692737	They have different missions.
692817	696118	But I can't get this one to trigger because I think I passed it up somewhere.
696278	696598	I don't know.
697258	700178	So that's kind of annoying because if I can't get the trigger, then I can't get 100%.
700218	702119	And that would really suck.
703580	704841	and then I played this game.
705101	708925	It's a demo for a game called Crash Time because I thought, hey, this is going to be cool.
708965	715191	It's like a European game that looks really cheesy and it was cheap and I tried it out and it's not very good.
715211	717854	It's basically like an arcade chase game.
717934	721718	You are the police and you have to do different things.
721898	725081	They'll have it where you have to do 30% damage to the person you're chasing and
725902	729104	MakeEmStop for three seconds or something like that.
729604	731825	So I tried that, and I just didn't care for it.
731945	732465	It's kind of dumb.
733706	736227	Nothing will replace my Earth Defense Force 2017.
737808	739728	And then, let's see.
740809	744030	You know, actually, I think that was about it for my gaming week.
744551	746692	Pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.
748793	749873	I don't think I played anything else.
750833	751074	Nice.
751674	751894	All right.
752418	754501	Well, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
754541	757765	I played more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted to Warcraft.
757845	758126	Thank you.
759568	764334	But I would like to announce that our guild finally full cleared Karazhan this week.
764535	765756	We did a full clear of Karazhan.
765776	767419	You have to be a WoW nerd to understand what that means.
767999	770840	So that's a full clear on Kara and one boss down in Zolomon.
770860	776683	And considering there aren't 25 of us to run the big raids, we have to do the little raids, it's great.
776743	781945	And I'm very excited at the news that Wrath of the Lich King is going to have 10 mans equivalent to every 25 man.
781965	782786	That makes me very happy.
783539	785360	Anyhow, enough wow nerddom.
785380	786581	I did play some other games this week.
786681	794725	I downloaded a new game from the Steam service, which as you know is kind of like PC's answer to Xbox Live, I guess you could say.
794785	795826	It's made by Valve.
796386	797907	The company did Orange Box and all that stuff.
797927	799868	They sell a lot of other games on there, some independent games.
800829	802530	I just decided to check out Audiosurf.
803712	804393	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
832651	833351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
861348	862609	Thank you for watching!
878669	882370	And it's kind of neat because the game does come with its own soundtrack.
882410	885871	It comes with the Orange Box soundtrack because, you know, hello, it's Valve.
886211	889232	So, you know, you can play still alive in Audiosurf to your heart's content.
889552	899034	But here's one thing I thought was kind of interesting about Audiosurf is that as you're playing the game, in the results screen that comes up, it will still show you
899634	902395	and Leaderboards for the song you played.
902816	905717	In other words, it doesn't matter what song you played from your library.
906337	916522	The servers, I guess, keep track of all the file names or it must be some type of algorithm between file name and the way the music file was read by the game.
916542	918624	It's probably the CD database, how they have those.
918904	921405	Possibly, but it's not really playing off a CD either.
921425	922846	But it'll take it off the...
923966	925747	Was it the MD5 hash or whatever?
925787	926928	Yeah, kind of something like that.
927008	937155	So I thought that was really cool because I played an Echo Image song, which Echo Image is kind of an obscure band unless you're really familiar with the DDR series or synth pop in general.
937595	940917	And to my surprise, there were a couple other people that had played the same song I did.
941277	943378	So I thought that was kind of neat the way they had the leaderboards in that game.
943398	945700	And then you can have your own friends list and all that good stuff.
946240	949382	And Steam has its own achievements-like thing that you can do in AudioSurf.
949782	951504	But here's the other thing about AudioSurf is that...
952444	961350	Not only did it have, like, the Klax-style gameplay, which is kind of cool because it reads the file in advance, and the track is kind of like a giant roller coaster.
961690	968975	Like, you know, and during the really intense part of the songs, you're going, like, straight downhill, and you're going really fast, and you have to collect these blocks really fast.
969255	974999	And then during the more slow build-up parts of the songs, you know, like, you know the song Skulk by Echo Image?
975259	979382	You know, like, during that little, like, tiny instrumental part, like, it's just building up, do-do-do.
979622	980323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
997705	1001966	The thing is that you can pick different types of ships as well that you can control.
1002006	1003927	And it kind of changes the core element of the game.
1004247	1011829	Like if the Klax thing is too confusing for you, there's like a simple ship that you can pick where the blocks are either gray or they're colored.
1012169	1015510	And it is collect colored blocks, avoid gray blocks.
1015630	1016630	It makes it very easy.
1017170	1019391	And you can kind of step up the different types.
1019491	1024872	Or you can do like a ship that will shuffle the colors occasionally or a ship where you can hold blocks individually.
1025172	1025853	It's kind of neat.
1026493	1027554	I really enjoyed the game.
1028876	1038724	The only thing is that I didn't think a lot of times the music making algorithm that made the tracks and the blocks wasn't often really in time with the music.
1038784	1047192	I mean, you're not going to have something as spot on as Beatmania 2DX or DDR or Rock Band or any of those things that are pre-programmed for the songs in it.
1047552	1055735	But, you know, I cut it a little slack because considering you can play any song in the world, you know, there's only so much you can do to get it accurate.
1056175	1064358	And for what it's worth, I did think the uphill-downhill things, like it's very good at detecting, you know, lots of volume, little volume, and kind of building the course that way.
1064438	1066559	So I give it props for that.
1066599	1068140	And I would recommend the game because it's only $10.
1069505	1070186	So there you have it.
1070848	1080986	And if you want to, you can hopefully hope that this game is going to come out on Xbox Live because there's rumors that the game might be coming out on Xbox Live and I think that's a really good place for it is Xbox Live.
1081046	1081948	But here's the problem.
1083208	1089631	I think the reason why it works so well as a PC game is the fact that you can use any MP3 you want or any song you want directly from your drive.
1090171	1096314	Yes, on Xbox you can import your own music files, yeah, but do the masses really know how to do that?
1096775	1097915	Probably not so much.
1098476	1101937	So I don't know how successful the game would be on Xbox Live, but I'd still be all for it.
1101997	1107800	I mean, it's not like there aren't other games that do use the extended soundtrack, every Extend Extra Extreme.
1108000	1108300	Hello.
1108961	1109461	So there you have it.
1111128	1112469	Let's see, reading some comments in chats.
1112989	1118112	Gold Banjo asks, Sky, can't people just edit the ID3 tags and cheat the leaderboards?
1118452	1122614	Gold Banjo, I don't think so because the leaderboards are independent for each song.
1122894	1124775	I didn't notice any type of comprehensive leaderboard.
1125015	1127256	So if you edit the ID3 tag, then you're on a new song.
1127376	1128857	I don't even think it's the ID3 tag.
1128897	1130017	I think it may be just...
1131318	1134681	HitStun says, actually it only looks at the artist and song title tags.
1134721	1138704	No hash checking is done and people cheat by playing 20 minute songs tagged to look like other songs.
1138724	1139304	Well, that's messed up.
1155717	1160980	So maybe Audiosurf needs to consider the length of the MP3 as well.
1161000	1162121	That would probably be a good idea.
1162661	1163582	So there you have it.
1163802	1165103	So Audiosurf, I liked.
1165283	1166944	And that was really the only new game I played this week.
1166984	1167604	Oh, I take that back.
1167884	1171046	I played that new Sudoku game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.
1171226	1171626	I'm sorry.
1175327	1176147	It's Sudoku, folks.
1176187	1182570	I mean, really, if you haven't played Sudoku and you're a big Sudoku fan... Here's the thing.
1182930	1183890	I've abstained by choice.
1184310	1192473	I give Xbox Live props for trying to put games out there that are going to appeal to other people than just hardcore gamers.
1193093	1194394	But I don't know if this is it.
1194634	1195014	That's okay.
1195054	1196334	It'll be delisted soon.
1196414	1197775	It'll be delisted in six months anyway.
1198435	1201337	And then I played the Warlords game as well, which was... I'm sorry.
1201357	1205741	I had a little more fun with that because I remember the old school Warlords game, but they really kind of changed it.
1206581	1212346	And you can notice for yourself, play the new, because you can do the demo, play the evolved version versus the old version.
1212666	1214507	The way it works is kind of different.
1214867	1220492	The new version is more like Breakout, which, yeah, the old version was too, but the ways the castles were shaped were even different.
1220812	1223834	And I don't know, it plays a lot differently and not as fast.
1224134	1224655	It's weird.
1224835	1225795	No thanks, I think I'll skip it.
1225815	1226116	It was weird.
1226716	1235245	I mean, at least it's only five bucks, and I bet Xbox Live is kind of fun, but I think Warlords is one of those games you best remember as something that was at Chuck E. Cheese when you were a kid.
1236266	1239409	And sadly, this one I'm noticing about a lot of the retro titles on Xbox Live.
1239469	1243413	Like, I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but Discs of Tron.
1244034	1248318	That was kind of disappointing to play on Xbox Live, because that was one of those games that's best left in my childhood.
1249099	1249540	What can you do?
1250253	1254657	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into tonight's news.
1254977	1264284	Really only a little bit of housekeeping tonight, and that is that if you are unaware, our 6th anniversary show is coming up in 3 weeks, if you can believe it or not.
1264684	1271630	Orange Lounge Radio started on June 23rd of 2002, and so in about 3 weeks we're going to be looking at our 6th anniversary show.
1272150	1273872	We have no idea what to do.
1274352	1274892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1297611	1309285	and we'll see because the show has always been about the chatters and the listeners and interacting so why not we'll be your monkeys this anniversary within reason I mean if you know the suggestion is you know naked show that's probably not going to happen
1309730	1313172	Okay, Actdeft, we're not having a fuck show until we don't say we are.
1313673	1314093	Exactly.
1314133	1315434	The fuck show is a surprise.
1315974	1318155	First rule about fuck show, you don't talk about fuck show.
1318456	1321978	And we haven't really made up any other rules beyond that because we have to have rules for that.
1322158	1322398	Yes.
1323759	1325420	Somebody has to moderate and all that fun stuff.
1325440	1326201	So we'll plan it.
1326221	1326621	Don't worry.
1327061	1328562	No, that's the first thing.
1328602	1330623	The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.
1330663	1331224	That's for sure.
1332978	1335059	and Brad from PodCulture says, drunk fuck show.
1335599	1338520	I can't get drunk right now because of everything else going on.
1339280	1339561	All right.
1340361	1340741	Anyhow.
1341421	1342722	We could give you some LSD.
1343822	1344943	Oh, I could probably smoke pot.
1344963	1345463	I'd be okay.
1345483	1346603	You could.
1346623	1347824	Pot's not bad.
1347844	1348824	No, drugs are bad, okay?
1349544	1350305	Drugs are bad, okay?
1350905	1351225	All right.
1351945	1352286	Forget it.
1352926	1354126	Let's get into some gaming news.
1354166	1355887	Please, Loki, save the show from drug talk.
1356189	1371661	All right, this week there was an event being held in France for Ubi Days 2008, where they were showing off a bunch of their titles, and one that they showed off only in trailer form, and it was kind of at the closing of the conference.
1372282	1372402	It's...
1373903	1374923	Beyond Good and Evil 2.
1375564	1380825	It's being reimagined now for the next-gen consoles, and I'd imagine probably the PC as well.
1381466	1385707	And they had a little teaser trailer, which you can see Uncle Page.
1386147	1387708	So, I don't know.
1387848	1388328	It looks cool.
1388488	1393450	I never really played the first Beyond Good and Evil, so I don't really know what to expect from this.
1393530	1401432	Beyond Good and Evil is one of those really cult hits kind of things, so I know there's a lot of people very excited about this, because I think a lot of people didn't think it would ever happen.
1401972	1402473	So there you have it.
1402913	1403413	Looks good, though.
1404793	1405113	Alright.
1405894	1408895	Hopefully we'll probably find out more about this during E3.
1409535	1412457	That little pig guy thing kind of scared me, just so you know.
1413477	1414477	Did you see the pictures of that?
1414697	1414918	Yeah.
1414958	1415858	That was very scary.
1415878	1416498	That's Uncle Paige.
1416818	1417799	Yeah, that scared me.
1419311	1423733	Also coming to the PlayStation pretty soon because Beyond Good and Evil 2 is PS3, right?
1424214	1425394	All the next-gen systems, right?
1425414	1425934	Yeah, I think so.
1426054	1432337	Well, also coming to the PlayStation 3 sometime eventually will be Home, Sony Home.
1432758	1436839	Well, Ubisoft has announced that they are going to be doing something special for Home.
1437240	1440721	They are going to be doing one of their events online.
1441302	1441782	Here's the thing.
1443403	1449446	In the PlayStation Home media and events space, they're going to be showing off all these new Ubisoft titles.
1450027	1454029	Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, HAWX, Hawks or whatever.
1454389	1455370	Soul Calibur 4.
1455710	1456550	But here's the thing.
1456790	1459092	You can only get there if you have a closed beta account.
1459112	1459972	Soul Calibur 4?
1461113	1461613	That's weird.
1461653	1463014	Yeah, that's not an Ubisoft title.
1463054	1464095	I don't know why that's on the list.
1464835	1466496	I guess maybe that's sharing the space.
1466536	1466936	Who knows?
1467657	1467797	Okay.
1468530	1471932	But whatever, there are these other games at least as well that are going to be in the space.
1472712	1478956	Well, that's cool, yeah, because I know right now it's only open, or I should say it's closed beta right now, so those are the only people that are able to enjoy that.
1479256	1485600	And prior to this, they did a recreation of the Sony, I think they call it PlayStation Day.
1486180	1494645	So they're kind of showing what it would look like for future events, which I think is pretty cool that they have this whole interactive thing going on.
1494985	1497287	It's definitely a different way to approach it.
1498027	1499028	Kind of interesting.
1499068	1507715	I mean, since the rest of us can't go to E3 anymore because we're not in the Cool Kids Club, you know, we could go to E3 in home, which I think is kind of interesting.
1507815	1512379	You know, the more I think of it, the more I don't really care that we're in the good graces of publishers.
1514220	1516342	Because we get to say whatever we want in the show.
1516962	1517683	I don't mind either.
1518383	1519384	So, screw it.
1520205	1521226	Yeah, the hell with them.
1522527	1525089	We can say something sucks as much as we want to.
1525189	1525849	Exactly.
1527273	1529739	If we want to review Metal Gear Solid 4 early, we can.
1530741	1534029	Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake is old.
1534630	1536856	We'll talk about the hard drive space all we want.
1537662	1540324	Yeah, that's probably why we don't have advanced screeners.
1540364	1542505	Yeah, that's probably why we don't get advanced screeners.
1542525	1545007	This is coming out though on the Japanese PlayStation Store.
1545247	1545427	What?
1545447	1546928	This is on the 26th of June.
1547408	1550170	And when I read this, my response was LOL what?
1551971	1553232	They're doing a gardening game.
1554353	1555454	It's called Shikitei.
1556314	1563119	And basically you can go outside and plant trees and plant flowers and watch them grow.
1565415	1586948	and it's supposed to be um 1600 yen and it's supposed to be relaxing for the older gamer there's no word if we're ever getting it but i i was just like what and it made me think about the saturn game that came out that was all audio and it came with seeds and he was and it was supposed to help your plant grow
1588615	1591496	Okay, so correct me if I'm wrong.
1591936	1592216	Always.
1592276	1597919	But you are saying now that I can use my PlayStation 3 to watch the grass grow.
1598159	1598419	Yes.
1600339	1606282	You don't even get the benefit of insects or animals to scamper through your garden and eat the leaves off of your petunias.
1606902	1607162	Nice.
1608122	1609923	But you can plant cherry trees.
1610483	1611924	Why don't you just go plant real trees?
1613086	1614347	That's the beauty of video games
1635126	1635466	I don't know.
1635546	1638207	How about spend the 1600 yen on something better?
1639428	1641488	Like tacos.
1643029	1644450	I don't know.
1644470	1651832	I'm sure you can find tacos in Japan, but if I had 1600 yen, I would just go be buying maybe some Anpan or something.
1652233	1652933	Anpan is delicious.
1652953	1655074	I'm having a dream game brainstorm.
1655894	1658135	What kind of video game could they make about tacos?
1659571	1660572	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1686713	1687874	I love chicken sauce tacos.
1687895	1688675	Tacos are not lame.
1688876	1689597	You know what's lame?
1689637	1690157	You're lame.
1690337	1691559	Tacos are not lame.
1692240	1693361	You know what's lame?
1693801	1694442	Your butt.
1694502	1695243	You know what's lame?
1695263	1697546	A gardening game on any system.
1698207	1700369	It's like Viva Pinata minus the pinatas.
1701290	1702292	Or the Viva.
1703393	1704214	Or the Viva, yes.
1706277	1707318	Pinata Verte.
1707838	1710739	I had to cover that for the, what the hell are they thinking?
1711019	1713421	And it's only in Japan, right?
1713481	1717603	Okay, it's a neat idea that they're putting out a game that's different.
1717623	1718323	For old people!
1718343	1721445	For old people that will buy practically anything, I guess.
1722845	1725487	But 1,600 yen seems... It was 1,600 yen?
1725567	1726007	Yeah.
1726867	1728108	That seems kind of expensive.
1728228	1730049	It's like seven bucks.
1730549	1731190	That's still expensive.
1731210	1732490	I mean, why am I saying seven bucks?
1732931	1733251	It's like...
1734953	1735394	Maybe $16.50.
1736276	1738901	Yeah, it's like $15 about, right?
1738921	1739402	Okay, that's lame.
1741513	1742593	Let's have tea agrees.
1742633	1744775	Taco Time would be an amazing name for a game.
1744815	1745555	I mean, honestly.
1747116	1752980	We won't officially add anything to the Dream Games list yet, but be thinking about Taco Time.
1753521	1754701	There's a game in there somewhere.
1755462	1756102	More tacos, less drugs.
1756122	1759485	You can do a remake of Burger Time and add other food to it.
1759745	1761006	That you create other things.
1761326	1763908	Not only burgers, but other meals and stuff.
1764048	1765389	Nah, bored now.
1765969	1767670	Well, that's because it was a bad idea anyway.
1767750	1768911	So there's your Taco Time.
1768951	1769331	Bad idea.
1769411	1770272	I have a Dream Game.
1771072	1771273	What?
1771933	1772994	Action Bastard the game.
1774215	1774316	No.
1774556	1775497	No Dream Games tonight.
1776157	1782643	Unfortunately, one game that's not being included in the new firmware for the PS3 is Taco Time.
1783184	1785266	But some other things are going to be added in there.
1785706	1790471	And these are all, of course, rumors, but there's a lot of, I don't know...
1791693	1793114	Evidence to point towards it.
1794314	1808862	So the rumor is that they're adding both the in-game cross-media bar, which is something that should have been there, I don't know, from the start, and trophies, which, you know, is Sony's way of saying, hey, we like achievements, but how can we get around a lawsuit?
1809623	1811824	So those will be coming very soon.
1812745	1816086	In fact, they have been spotted already in...
1817427	1845864	a video showing the new Bioshock for Playstation 3 apparently a member of MaxConsoleForums has posted some images and video during Bioshock that they found so interesting but either way you know these are coming because you know they've announced this previously it's just a matter of time but then again it could get delayed forever like Home has and everything else Sony related so
1848357	1848697	All right.
1849218	1849498	I don't know.
1849518	1850499	Do you think this is a good idea?
1850539	1851800	Is this something PlayStation needs?
1852041	1852401	Yeah, sure.
1852601	1856825	I mean, because I know achievements have gotten me to play games I probably wouldn't normally play.
1857085	1859227	So, I mean, it's only a good thing for them.
1860308	1862850	I think, I mean, sure, we'll get over it.
1862971	1867054	But right now, since we haven't gotten over it yet, I still think it's a cheap ripoff.
1867194	1869757	But, you know, more power to them, I guess.
1871872	1878897	By the way, I got a private message from Cheeseburger in chat who's suggesting that Taco Time could be like Taco Mama instead of Cooking Mama.
1878937	1879457	Taco Mama.
1879477	1881859	That would be Cooking Mama Junk Food Edition.
1881979	1884501	Besides, they do have a restaurant called Taco Time.
1885261	1888964	Let's have Tia saying, is everyone else seriously missing the sexual euphemism?
1889504	1890745	I'm not at all.
1890805	1892526	But that would be Fish Taco Time.
1893927	1895268	That could be the bonus stage.
1897890	1898470	All right, forget it.
1898510	1899531	Enough about tacos.
1899911	1899991	No.
1902262	1904785	That's actually an in-joke amongst me and some other people.
1905866	1906226	Forget it.
1906486	1906767	Okay.
1909729	1910971	Now they're talking about muffins.
1911071	1911671	What's up with that?
1911892	1913333	Muffins are also sexual.
1914234	1915155	Muffins!
1915815	1916516	Banana muffins.
1919279	1920200	Blood muffins.
1920620	1921401	Blood muffin?
1922081	1922442	Forget it.
1922802	1925004	Have you seen the YouTube thing about... Forget it.
1926205	1926546	Anyhow...
1928530	1934271	The PlayStation 3 game End War is going to be getting some very interesting types of controls.
1934771	1940833	Gesture-activated commands are coming soon to the End War game, which is a Tom Clancy game.
1941153	1949554	Here's the thing, you actually use the PlayStation Eye to do it, and you can wave your hands, like if you wave your hand underneath the camera, then you get the game's overhead map.
1950475	1951895	And, I don't know, it's kind of...
1952535	1953837	Thank you for watching!
1963314	1965595	Yeah, that's why Par Par Paradise really took off, huh?
1965675	1972476	Strangely enough, nothing about a 360 equivalent because there is that whole vision camera, but no word yet about that.
1972496	1977218	Yeah, but the vision camera sucks and the PlayStation Eye is supposed to be a little bit more detailed.
1977838	1982139	How much different are they really besides maybe resolution?
1982679	1983059	I don't know.
1983219	1986520	I know my vision camera hasn't been used ever since I got it.
1987380	1989861	I took my picture with it and I was about as far as I went.
1989981	1992523	Oh, and I tried playing Totem Ball and then that sucked too.
1993063	1995584	But the PlayStation Eye, I guess it's a good use of it.
1995804	2001827	Although I'd rather see those, you know, other games that they had that they were showing off little tech demos for.
2002367	2013292	But hey, I mean, if you want some crappy use for a $30 camera, then sure, let's just make it so I can wave my hand under the camera instead of, I don't know, pushing a button.
2015029	2015650	What's easier?
2015930	2019693	Seriously, if we're going to be lazy here, pushing a button or waving your hand?
2019933	2020873	I think pushing the button.
2021994	2025997	Just so you know, this is still in development and may not actually make the final cut of the game.
2026017	2027918	It's just something that's being played with right now.
2027938	2031420	I would think it'd be gesture control, like flipping off the enemy or something.
2031460	2041347	Well, now if they had it where you're actually... Because the article referred the control to being similar to Total Recall.
2041747	2042428	Or not Total Recall...
2043456	2044217	Minority Report.
2044257	2045397	Why the hell?
2045978	2046478	Wrong movie there.
2046618	2054543	Anyways, if it was more like that where you're actually using your hands to move a map around and stuff like that, that'd be kind of cool.
2054623	2058065	But just to wave your hand to bring up a map is kind of stupid.
2060462	2073412	Sully907 is commenting on the previous story about the firmware once firmware 2.4 comes out the PlayStation Network becomes on par with Xbox Live Xbox Live is still slightly better but not enough to justify $50 anymore agree or disagree?
2075357	2082381	I wouldn't agree, because I still think as far as content that's on there, there's a lot less content on the PlayStation Network.
2082881	2095288	I mean, download content's a little on par, especially with some of the games that are coming out in both systems, but as far as original games and new PlayStation Network games, there really hasn't been that many that have come out.
2095328	2097529	It's not every week like Xbox Live Arcade.
2098070	2101872	True, although I do think maybe it's time for Xbox Live to get a little price cut.
2102612	2102973	Who knows?
2103333	2103593	We'll see.
2103613	2104974	But they do tend to update a lot more.
2105034	2107557	I think they should, too, especially since they're advertising on there.
2107697	2109278	True.
2109819	2112101	I don't pay a monthly subscription to watch ads.
2112121	2114343	When has that ever stopped other games from doing the same thing?
2114403	2115104	Yeah.
2115624	2117566	Now they're talking about motion-based games in chat.
2117586	2120149	They're talking about Power, Power, Power Dice and all this stuff.
2120209	2121050	Crunky Boy Jr.
2121110	2126034	says they should have a spin-off of the Wii Fit hula hoop game where you put symbols in your ass.
2127042	2129123	I'm not really sure how that works, but okay.
2130204	2136568	Speaking of Wii Fit and the hula hoop game, I doubt you've seen this, DarkSakura, but Loki, did you see the YouTube this week?
2137049	2138570	It was posted on Dig.
2139050	2143333	It was some guy taping his girlfriend playing the Wii Fit hula hoop game.
2143613	2144213	But here's the thing.
2144253	2148536	She was a nice-looking gal, and she had a nice little booty on her, right?
2149937	2151098	She was wearing nothing but panties.
2151398	2152759	Well, she was wearing panties and a T-shirt.
2154600	2177971	and the thing is that while she's playing the hula hoop game the boyfriend like zooms in on her butt and put it on the internet for everybody to see and now it's everywhere and at the very end of the video like the guy puts the camera on himself and he gives one of those like yeah type of looks if you haven't seen it it's hilarious I'm gonna find it I can't believe you guys haven't seen it I'm gonna find it
2178291	2179771	I will play it in studio after the next story.
2179791	2186513	I don't really look at Dig anymore because, well, especially their gaming topics, I've already seen most of that, step by time.
2186553	2191395	There's a lot of crap on there, but there's some decent stories that sometimes slip under the radar, like this one.
2191455	2194355	So I'll find it on YouTube for you guys while we cover the next story.
2194556	2195496	How is that decent?
2195536	2196616	That sounds indecent.
2197216	2198477	Well, I have something more decent.
2198517	2203638	It has to do with the PAL PSN update of stuff-ness.
2204618	2205579	They got something good.
2206119	2206779	Like, one good thing.
2207799	2213625	Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix MatchingService.com
2225147	2251214	it's £6.99 over there so everyone download it they also have Rayman on the PS3 and PC store for PSP for £3.49 also Medieval Resurrection for PSP out for £14.99 and Go Sudoku packs at £1.99 or you can download the whole thing for £4.99 and the Army of Two Veteran Map Pack
2252230	2257357	There's also Prince of Persia wallpaper, like you care, but hey.
2258639	2259180	So that's all.
2260582	2263846	So I guess there are quite a few things coming to PlayStation Network after all.
2263906	2264227	Who knew?
2264948	2267131	Yeah, well, late at least.
2267491	2267772	I don't know.
2269099	2270860	Better eventually than not at all.
2271240	2272520	Search for a user on YouTube.
2272560	2273460	His name is Tinsley Advertising.
2273560	2274220	T-I-N-S-L-E-Y Advertising.
2274240	2275040	All one word there.
2275060	2277201	Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit.
2297180	2299341	So here's the girl.
2299861	2301101	She's starting to play Wii Fit.
2303142	2304042	And look at that.
2305543	2309624	I mean, and she's kind of like, you can tell she's kind of one of those cute nerdy girls too.
2309664	2312485	She's wearing glasses and got a little ponytail, right?
2312985	2316626	And then she has this little booty on her.
2316706	2317787	And she's playing Wii Fit.
2317807	2319607	What do you think, Loki?
2322909	2323809	Yeah.
2323989	2325309	Loki gave thumbs up.
2325549	2329071	Sorry we don't have just the TV tonight so you can see how Loki gave the thumbs up there.
2329391	2331171	DarkSakura, offensive or funny?
2332632	2335193	I'm apathetic towards it.
2335453	2335993	Ambivalent.
2336073	2336773	Ambivalent would work.
2336873	2338134	It was her idea.
2338254	2339314	I'm sure it was.
2339534	2342335	Oh, I didn't know you were filming me.
2342495	2346016	I'm going to the end of the video just because you have to see this guy when he looks at the camera.
2346637	2348537	He's like, yeah.
2350118	2350398	Yeah.
2351385	2355468	Well, yeah, you put the link in the chat room, so.
2355968	2356688	There you have it.
2357349	2357769	Just look.
2359770	2362532	See, now we're going to get a whole bunch of the chat room going.
2364013	2365433	You know, I'm not even going to look at the chat room.
2365454	2365654	Whatever.
2365774	2370236	Okay, Actdeft is questioning my sexuality because, you know, I'm the gay one on the show, but I like girls.
2370256	2372718	But I have an appreciation for the female form.
2372758	2377181	I can see the, you know, I can see why people like this video.
2377221	2378842	She's taking it as a compliment.
2378942	2379082	Yeah.
2379762	2382584	Are they releasing it in Africa?
2382624	2382724	Huh?
2408228	2411249	I would assume so, since that's not Europe.
2411869	2413630	So, I don't know, maybe.
2414771	2417752	That would be really bad if Africa was excluded from their own game.
2418492	2420053	I want to be able to run over the animals.
2420073	2421873	That's the only way I will buy this game.
2422354	2424114	They just need to do a new Jumbo Safari.
2427116	2433378	But hey, if you ever wanted to go to a virtual safari, then Africa is the game for you.
2433398	2435559	It's supposed to be coming out in August.
2437122	2438782	Do we know what Africa is yet?
2439523	2440283	Anything about it?
2440363	2441863	Isn't it a taking pictures game?
2442703	2443183	I think so.
2443363	2445444	Pokemon Snap, but not with Pokemon?
2448344	2448704	I don't know.
2448744	2451065	Let's look at the other games that have come out that have been very similar.
2451545	2452165	Endless Ocean.
2453185	2454106	No one bought that.
2455466	2457306	Wild Earth African Safari.
2458526	2459387	No one bought that.
2461227	2462107	Pokemon Snap.
2462647	2464648	Long time ago, people bought it because it's Pokemon.
2465268	2465948	And it's fun!
2466857	2467418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2483876	2489619	There was also a Sakura Taisen game, I think, that came out that had a bunch of weird, bizarre shit in it.
2489699	2497665	But the good thing is, though, if you are in Europe and you really, really, really want to play Africa... Region free, right?
2497825	2498365	Exactly.
2498525	2499906	So just import the US one.
2500206	2500707	Africa.
2500947	2501908	If you have an HDTV.
2502968	2503489	There you have it.
2504709	2505090	All right.
2505690	2506190	Let's see.
2508092	2508572	Moving on.
2509304	2510545	Bioshock Bioshock
2531898	2538605	New features and content that will make this a must-have game for its new audience as well as for those who enjoyed it on other platforms.
2538945	2542809	I don't know if that means additional levels or weapons or other types of things.
2543750	2546773	God, I hope it's not multiplayer finally or something, you know?
2547053	2549836	Can you imagine if PlayStation 3 had like the Deathmatch exclusive?
2549876	2550036	No.
2550516	2551916	No, they won't do that.
2552677	2554717	I don't think that games and mechanics were built for that.
2554737	2561079	If anything, if they were talking about new content in there, I bet you it's the download content that was already available on the Xbox and PC.
2562079	2564520	Maybe like a bonus level or something, right?
2565340	2566480	I don't even think they're going to do that.
2566520	2568261	Maybe another difficulty or something like that.
2568321	2571502	What would make me want to re-buy it if I already had it on the other systems?
2571582	2573682	Unless there was some really good extras.
2574302	2576123	It's not like we're talking about a cheap game here.
2577312	2577552	I don't know.
2577572	2578352	Maybe the game will be cheap.
2578372	2579473	Maybe that'll be the kicker.
2579493	2579733	I don't know.
2579753	2596036	What they could do, they could do like some of the other cheap stuff that some other first person shooters have done like a survival mode where they just keep sending enemies at you and see how long you can survive or I don't know more plasmids I guess they could add to it.
2597677	2601218	WhatUpG in chat is asking when is Bioshock 2 due out?
2601258	2602738	Do we know anything about Bioshock 2?
2603218	2603458	No.
2603758	2604478	I think 09 holiday.
2604498	2604558	Huh.
2607950	2608230	Alright.
2609491	2610432	Well, we'll see what happens.
2612093	2615556	I'm still shaking my head over this next story.
2616177	2616377	Why?
2616877	2620020	Because people are so gullible.
2622345	2631891	I don't know if anyone has seen the Fallout 3 screenshots that were out that shows basically Washington turned into a big, you know, soot-covered smoking crater.
2633452	2640977	But an intelligence contractor called SITE, S-I-T-E, Intel Group...
2642657	2646598	Thought that they were Al-Qaeda images, you know, propaganda.
2647379	2650499	And a few, I guess, anti-U.S.
2651240	2659862	sites posted them up, you know, and had chat logs and everything about it, saying that this was their big dream to see or whatever.
2660703	2662506	There were screens for Fallout 3.
2662546	2666472	They haven't heard any word back officially.
2668155	2674445	One thing that I did think was funny in this article on Kotaku is that Sight is based in Bethesda.
2676337	2682581	Well, I mean, it's actually terrorists are using those images from Fallout 3 or supposed terrorists.
2682621	2684642	Well, I think they're just affiliated sites.
2684682	2687824	I don't think they're actually... I think they're just like terrorist fanboys or something.
2688644	2690285	Terrorist fanboys?
2690705	2699170	Oh, you know, any political faction is gonna have their little follower, so... And just to kind of go back a few... Well, it's not even really a story, but...
2700331	2704616	That YouTube that you were talking about there, apparently there were some comments on the dig for it.
2705256	2713485	And Tinsley Advertising actually replied back and said, Sorry guys, I got on our dig front page and well, my girlfriend found out and she's a tiny bit upset.
2713886	2720693	I thought it was cute and it actually, or it was done with good intentions if she ever doubted how hot she is.
2721897	2724239	Over 1 million views on that YouTube, though.
2724559	2728282	I mean, she's an internet star, at least her buddy is.
2728302	2730123	I mean, because you never see her face.
2730924	2733446	Can you imagine walking by her on the street?
2733806	2735067	Where do I know you from?
2735107	2735988	Where do I know you from?
2736048	2738009	And then as she's leaving, I remember!
2742273	2742753	Forget it.
2743554	2743914	All right.
2744654	2748978	That's kind of, you know, if Dan did that, I'd have to smack him.
2750057	2756621	Amaze Satsuma in chat says, I would buy Bioshock again if it came with the living Big Daddy than just the statue.
2757101	2757661	It's pretty awesome.
2758702	2762624	About the Fallout things, though, I saw that picture of the whole Washington, D.C.
2762684	2767667	looking destroyed thing, and it is pretty scary how realistic some of these games are getting.
2767687	2770789	But then again, I mean, remember Independence Day?
2771786	2772627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2795899	2796640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2827878	2844873	Which I thought was funny Okay, the chatroom agrees it was 1995 So, I mean, it's not like we haven't seen these horrific images, quote-unquote, before But, you know, at least when you're watching a movie trailer, you know you're watching a movie trailer But when you see these random images on the internet of Washington, D.C.
2844913	2849757	looking all destroyed It's kind of scary if you don't know what it is, you know what I mean?
2851440	2851740	I guess.
2853021	2858306	Well, this game may not be as cool as Fallout 3, but definitely one that I'm looking forward to.
2858386	2860629	Splatterhouse, the brand new remake.
2861249	2863732	They've got some interesting features that they've been talking about.
2864372	2873041	One of which is the fact that your limbs can basically be taken off, but after a short bit they will actually regrow back.
2873701	2876504	So that's kind of cool and very detailed.
2876824	2883750	I guess instead of like a health system, your skin will start coming off, then your flesh, and then your bones will break.
2884271	2886413	And all that stuff will kind of just grow right back.
2886913	2887534	Sounds lovely.
2887974	2888174	Yes.
2888775	2889595	And then apparently...
2891309	2898695	The Killzone script writer, Gordon Rennie, and I guess he did Judge Dredd and the Necronauts comics.
2899555	2902938	He's signed on to do the story for this game as well.
2903058	2904859	So that's pretty cool.
2906200	2910183	And the graphics on it so far look pretty good and very bloody.
2911684	2912785	Much like the original.
2913045	2914026	Yay, violence!
2915027	2915808	I like violence.
2916528	2917669	Violence is fantastic.
2918229	2918910	And sells stuff.
2919258	2921579	DarkSakura should get in panties and do the hula hoop game No
2948223	2949825	Just kidding, I'm not actually going to do that.
2952227	2953148	Little creepy!
2953969	2954730	Little creepy!
2955290	2957092	Alright, moving on.
2957513	2959375	Talking about Metal Gear Solid 4.
2959435	2963839	We kind of referenced this earlier because Konami's telling some people to put a lid on it.
2965404	2968926	Minor, minor spoilers here from Metal Gear Solid 4.
2969306	2973187	So if you don't want to know, skip ahead in the podcast by about a minute.
2973207	2974548	But these are just minor spoilers.
2974628	2975028	Don't worry.
2975568	2976068	Here's the thing.
2976809	2984791	Rosemary from Metal Gear Solid 2 is supposed to make an appearance, as well as Mei Ling from Metal Gear Solid the original.
2985112	2987733	They are going to be some characters in Metal Gear Solid 4.
2988213	2994175	So if you are looking forward to being reunited with some of your favorite females from Metal Gear history, there you go.
2996508	2999591	And maybe you can convince Mei Ling to get in her panties and play Wii Fit.
2999631	2999951	I don't know.
3001512	3001733	No.
3001933	3003114	You'll have to write a letter to Konami.
3003823	3004424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3027383	3029665	You can actually get it, I think, from PlayAsia for $28.
3031686	3037230	But there are spoilers on the track listing, so if you don't want spoilers, then don't get it.
3038311	3043655	However, if you do get the limited edition of the game, you will get a copy of the soundtrack too.
3046004	3053547	By the way, for Bomani fans, fans of Konami's music game series, I did notice one familiar name showed up on the soundtrack.
3054267	3057108	Soda Fujimori apparently contributed to a couple tracks too.
3058088	3060509	And he did some of the remixes in Beatmania 2DX.
3060669	3063150	So a little Konami connection there.
3063290	3063790	There you have it.
3064690	3065791	Konami connection.
3066131	3066331	I know.
3067487	3068428	One big happy family.
3068628	3074816	They kind of do that though with a lot of their soundtracks, especially like Contra and stuff has a lot of Konami artists on there.
3075717	3078841	You always see Akira and Suda.
3080140	3080800	Hulk Smash!
3109669	3111370	And it's the only reason I'd buy this game.
3111390	3114973	It's supposed to not suck that bad, but, you know, we'll have to see.
3115834	3121858	And then there's, of course, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360, which looks pretty awesome.
3122899	3128383	And also coming out on practically everything, Lego Indiana Jones.
3129063	3130264	So that looks pretty cool.
3130744	3134747	And Kung Fu Panda, yet another movie tie-in.
3135588	3137249	The trailer for that looks kind of funny, actually.
3138459	3145784	I don't know, I do and I don't want a game called Kung Fu Panda because on one hand it sounds really awesome and on one hand it sounds like a lot could go wrong.
3148086	3149126	It's based on a movie, right?
3149507	3150547	Yes.
3151548	3156251	Then on the Wii, there's Cabela's Trophy Bucks, which looks like crap.
3157632	3160635	On the PSP, Hot Shots Golf Open T2.
3161795	3166579	On the DS, Summon Night Twin Age, which looks like a pretty cool Atlus RPG.
3168109	3171613	God of War PSP Bundle Grid on PS3, Xbox 360, PC The Grid
3187097	3187477	Forget it.
3188358	3189839	Okay, well this game looks awesome.
3190059	3192081	This game's probably a lot better than The Grid.
3193302	3196225	But I am surprised we haven't seen that come to home consoles.
3196625	3197146	Me too.
3197746	3199448	Maybe they should make that for Xbox Live or something.
3200729	3201890	And let's see here.
3201910	3208096	And finally, next Sunday, the Metallic Rose DS Lite will be coming out.
3209097	3210138	More colors, yay!
3210896	3213418	It's metallic pink-ish.
3214018	3214859	It's light-ish red.
3215580	3216040	Yay!
3216620	3219202	Replacing the normal pink.
3221604	3224186	So now everyone's going to go scramble over themselves to get that?
3225407	3226708	Apparently, yes.
3227209	3228009	Can't wait.
3228069	3228510	Special.
3229324	3232546	Alright, let's talk about what's coming out in Japan overseas.
3232966	3242013	Coming out on June 5th for the Xbox 360, FIFA Street 3 as well as Ninja Gaiden 2 finally makes its way out in Japan on the Xbox 360.
3242513	3248937	Going over to the PlayStation 3, Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit makes its way as well as another port of FIFA Street 3.
3250218	3259104	And if we head on over to the Nintendo Wii, Fushugi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 3, Karakuri Yashiki no Nemuri Hime.
3259564	3263049	I have no idea what that game is, but it's being made by Sega.
3264190	3265932	And let's see, it is an RPG.
3265972	3266573	That's about all I know.
3266593	3268335	I'm trying to see if we have any screenshots of this game.
3268735	3269596	And sadly we do not.
3269636	3270557	We just have box art.
3271462	3274865	Dude, the guy looks like he has a little ferret as a companion.
3275185	3276006	Ferrets are great!
3276566	3277727	This might be a winner already.
3277767	3278588	Look at the box art.
3278888	3279629	I can't see.
3279869	3280970	It's Shirin the Wanderer.
3281310	3285673	It's a series that's ran since Saturn, I want to say.
3285954	3288456	They just had one that came out on the DS in the US.
3288956	3290918	Well, it's Shirin the Wanderer 3 then.
3291098	3293239	But dude, he's got a little ferret companion on his shoulder.
3293259	3294060	It's a dungeon crawler.
3294260	3295401	So did Beastmaster.
3295461	3296262	He had two ferrets.
3299076	3301236	And of course we endorse any game with ferrets in it.
3301576	3301957	That we do.
3301977	3302457	Absolutely.
3302697	3303357	Rob, ferret!
3304657	3305137	I'm trying.
3306257	3307538	I don't know where the ferret is.
3308158	3308518	Hide it.
3310278	3310658	Give.
3311478	3311858	Woohoo!
3312538	3312798	Alright.
3314239	3314579	Let's see.
3314639	3316219	Moving on to other Japanese releases.
3316259	3317599	That was it for the Nintendo Wii.
3318019	3321440	On the PlayStation 2, Ukuki is coming out.
3321920	3322180	What?
3322900	3323500	Ukuki.
3324261	3325401	That's what I say all the time.
3325641	3326101	Ukuki.
3327557	3328538	I don't think it's that.
3328598	3333761	This is an adventure game from Global A Entertainment.
3334222	3335483	And no screenshots or nothing.
3335523	3337044	I couldn't tell you exactly what this game is.
3337084	3338745	But the box art is very artistic.
3339245	3340706	Looks kind of hand-drawn almost.
3341747	3342147	Ukuki.
3343889	3348392	Yamasod, DG World, Collaboration SP, Pachislot Ridge Racer.
3350201	3352062	You can just imagine what that is.
3352142	3354945	I'll just leave it at that.
3355525	3356686	Pachinko for Ridge Racer.
3357667	3359209	It's a pachinko slot machine.
3359489	3362592	On the Nintendo DS, Deep Aquarium.
3364926	3366026	What is Deep Aquarium?
3366286	3367467	It's exactly what it sounds like.
3367507	3368247	It's an aquarium.
3368547	3369187	I'll be damned.
3369347	3369947	It really is.
3371107	3372208	No, it looks like the bottom.
3372228	3374988	It looks like Titanic imagery there on the cover.
3375188	3376849	Deep Titanic Aquarium.
3377569	3380650	Yes, you too can take care of your frozen corpses.
3380830	3384310	At first I thought it was an insane aquarium, but I was sadly mistaken.
3384831	3386971	And nothing this week on the Sony PSP.
3387271	3388791	Sorry, PSP fans in Japan.
3388831	3390872	That's it for release dates overseas in Japan.
3391448	3399936	Well, back to a different side of overseas, we have our UK release dates, and there's not a whole bunch of stuff, but hey, it's stuff still.
3400697	3403260	One that Rob would probably be interested in.
3404381	3408645	I just have to say really quick, HitStun has played that series of games, and it is a ferret.
3413142	3428994	On DS comes Etrian Odyssey, Everybody's Golf 2 for PSP, Lego Indiana Jones for a whole crap ton of everything else, Mass Effect on PC, Ninja Gaiden 2, Xbox 360, and Civilization Revolution for Rob.
3432574	3433174	Hooray!
3433295	3439659	Except I heard it got pushed back here in America at the very last minute, so I'm wondering if the same thing didn't happen over in Japan.
3439679	3440339	It only got pushed back a week.
3440399	3441040	Or over in Europe.
3441240	3442421	It's the second week in July.
3443802	3444642	No, that's more than a week.
3444662	3445863	It was supposed to be out the first week in June.
3445883	3447865	It's supposed to be the first week in... Oh, yeah.
3447945	3449366	It'll be out the first week of June in...
3451534	3453015	I knew about that a long time ago.
3453035	3454897	It just got delayed like a couple days ago.
3455057	3455537	No, it didn't.
3455597	3457038	It's been that date for a long time.
3457058	3458119	Well, that's when I heard about it.
3458139	3459760	Well, people just didn't know about it.
3460240	3462322	But there's also a bunch of good stuff, though, coming out this month.
3462342	3464944	If Europe gets that, too, I'm going to cry because I love Civilization.
3464984	3473350	I'm actually probably going to get this game because it seems like it really simplified what was becoming a very... Oh, God, I sound so dumb and babyish when I say this.
3473370	3475912	Are you going to get it for the 360 or DS?
3475932	3475912	360.
3476612	3477012	Achievements.
3477873	3478113	Why?
3478593	3479054	Achievements.
3479775	3480896	Yeah, that's what I said.
3481256	3481476	Why not?
3481536	3482277	And Xbox Live.
3482317	3483798	I'm assuming there's something for Xbox Live.
3485158	3485959	Remember CivNet?
3485979	3486699	That game was the shit.
3486739	3487520	I love CivNet.
3487860	3490562	If I could find a copy of CivNet that still worked, I'd actually probably play it.
3491122	3491603	It's awesome.
3493644	3493824	Cool.
3494124	3494524	There you go.
3495125	3499548	Akuma, JP, and Chat, by the way, just linked the official website for that game.
3500208	3504431	Because he actually lives in Japan, so he knows a little bit about some of the releases going on over there.
3504451	3505692	Is he going to get the gardening game?
3506432	3506772	No, nothing.
3507092	3508313	Oh, is he going to get the gardening game?
3508513	3509094	I somehow doubt it.
3510578	3516860	You know, if you really want the gardening game, you can just do a Japanese account and buy them.
3518741	3519201	Back to news.
3520642	3524803	Anyways, if gardening's not your thing, then perhaps Red vs. Blue is your thing.
3525484	3530425	And Red vs. Blue just released their brand new series, Reconstruction.
3531046	3536008	Now, it's a little bit more serious and less funny than the original.
3536548	3538849	Actually, it's not even really that funny at all, but...
3540129	3540769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3568462	3597616	which of course is set in Halo 3 very nice well one of these days there ought to be a Halo movie I know that's been all going back and forth and video game movies seem to be all the rage right now and now throwing their hat into the ring Brett Ratner he's a pretty famous Hollywood director he did the Rush Hour trilogy he did the third part in the X-Men series so take that however you want so do we stab him with our plastic knives yet?
3598147	3599868	I remember watching the first episode and saying, this is lame.
3616840	3617120	That's it.
3617180	3618861	I watched the first episode too and went, this is lame.
3619302	3626186	Anyhow, here's the thing is that apparently he is saying that he's going to be getting into gaming.
3626787	3630089	He says he'll, quote, be doing movies that come from video games.
3631070	3636133	He also is mentioning that he has ties to the Activision catalogs.
3636453	3638374	So possibly Call of Duty.
3638655	3639175	That'd be lame.
3639675	3640636	Soldier of Fortune.
3640756	3641156	Who knows?
3641737	3642257	I can't see it.
3642277	3643218	Guitar Hero, the movie.
3643498	3646180	I can see them doing something original, but Call of Duty, I mean.
3646920	3648001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3671341	3674807	I also heard a rumor that he's probably that he may be doing the God of War movie.
3675127	3676990	I also heard a rumor that he sucks.
3678672	3678973	Rumor?
3680135	3681296	Well, that may be fact.
3682791	3686453	Geekboy2424 says, like the Zelda movie, please make it happen.
3686473	3687013	Please, please, please.
3687433	3688433	In true fanboy fashion.
3689214	3690994	Wasn't that IGN thing good enough?
3691635	3693595	I think that that was all that there needs to be.
3693615	3696496	Yes, the IGN thing is all you're ever going to get, probably.
3697297	3698837	When has Nintendo ever... Oh, wait.
3699498	3705040	I take that back before it comes up because I remember I was going to say, when has Nintendo ever let any of their properties become movies?
3705560	3708641	And that's because for quite a while I had the Super Mario Bros.
3708701	3710582	movie erased from my memory.
3711246	3712326	I was just thinking that actually.
3712346	3713987	And I just brought it back for all the rest of you.
3714047	3715548	Remember Dennis Hopper as Bowser?
3715868	3717108	No, I didn't actually see that movie.
3717328	3717849	Good times.
3717889	3718669	John Leguizamo?
3718689	3719909	I actually have not seen that movie.
3720770	3721930	Oh, we need to have a movie night.
3722670	3724531	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3724631	3733134	Speaking of movies, before we get into the next story, Loki, you didn't talk about it during your gaming week, but you got to take a sneak peek at a recent movie, right?
3733575	3735455	Yes, I was screen number 14 for...
3737594	3738535	for Postal.
3739075	3740636	Actually, I've been watching that.
3740796	3747320	We got legitimate screener copies at our place of employment and got to check it out.
3747420	3750742	It's actually watchable, I guess.
3751603	3753344	They're trying to be controversial.
3753564	3758347	I don't know if I'm just desensitized to a lot of this stuff or if it just really falls flat, but...
3759919	3762380	There's some funny parts.
3762400	3775243	There's a part that I laughed at where he's at a job interview and they're asking him all these really stupid questions and then the very final question they ask him is this woman and she's like, what is the difference between a duck?
3778964	3779764	It makes no sense.
3780484	3786446	And he just blows up at her and his day kind of gets worse from there.
3786846	3786966	But
3788482	3790402	I don't know, there's funny parts, I guess, in it.
3790462	3798444	I mean, there's a part where Uwe Boll gets his nuts blown off, and he falls down dead saying, I hate video games.
3798964	3799704	Nice!
3800685	3803665	But any time that he was on screen, he wasn't even funny.
3803725	3807686	He was trying to be funny, you know, where, oh, I finance my movies with Nazi gold, huh?
3807846	3809026	I like children, huh?
3810206	3812007	And, you know, it just wasn't very funny.
3812247	3812627	And then...
3813993	3819677	Other parts, like, there's a part where they use a cat as a silencer, and that was kind of funny, because it's just ridiculous.
3820277	3826361	I don't know, there's a lot of ridiculous stuff in it, and a lot of stuff, like, there's a... Well, Postal's a pretty ridiculous game, too.
3826381	3835627	Yeah, well, there's a gunfight where all, you know, it seems like the only people getting killed brutally is, like, children, you know, so I guess that... That's kind of sick.
3835867	3839109	And then there's a part in the beginning, you know, where they're arguing about, you know, the...
3839790	3843875	How many virgins are going to get when they blow up a plane and stuff?
3843895	3845577	Because, you know, 9-11, ha, funny.
3846398	3847239	I don't know.
3848000	3853907	The thing is, like some other movies I've seen that have tried to be controversial, it doesn't really work.
3854207	3857511	I mean, it sort of is, I guess, but it's not like, oh my god.
3858072	3858673	Thank you for watching!
3871755	3874676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3891440	3892841	But not quite as funny
3906952	3909234	It's worth like a dollar rental or something like that.
3909334	3912917	I mean, I would maybe check it out just to say you've seen it.
3913197	3916019	Don't expect it to be very controversial or anything like that.
3916259	3921503	I mean, there's parts that they just get ridiculous with, like, you know, full frontal Dave Foley and stuff like that.
3922043	3925486	But it's just... I don't know.
3925646	3930590	It kind of works, but at the same time, it's just really ridiculous and very low budget, I guess.
3931530	3931690	With...
3933406	3937167	DJ Janai in chat says Postal equals the Razzie movie of the year.
3937247	3939167	Do you think the Razzies will even remember this movie?
3939247	3941228	I don't even think it deserves a Razzie.
3941928	3948550	I mean, as it is, it's 13 screens that it's on.
3948810	3952671	Hey, that's a lot better than the 4 that was originally thought it was supposed to be on.
3953391	3953751	I don't know.
3954111	3957512	I kind of want to see it just so I can understand for myself how...
3958570	3961274	It's not coming out for a while on DVD.
3961675	3965401	Not that far away, but not for a few months.
3965721	3967744	I think I'd like to view.
3969327	3971390	Alright, let's keep moving with the news.
3971430	3973554	Some of our listeners want to break so they can go to the bathroom.
3975053	3976854	Some people do want that, don't they?
3978254	3985136	At any rate, another series that has a pretty good following is the Brothers in Arms series.
3986736	3999019	There is actually a book that was put out, a novelization, that covers two of the days that weren't covered in the ten days of the operation that the game covers.
3999599	4001740	Basically, the game itself was for when...
4002680	4006761	The Allies were trying to seize a bridge in the Netherlands in 1944.
4008821	4017423	But now there's also talks about there being a movie based off of the Hell's Highway thing.
4017443	4018603	So that might be pretty cool.
4018643	4019503	See, that could work.
4019844	4026845	Brothers in Arms actually has characters and a story that it follows instead of just war, war, war, war, shoot, shoot, kill, kill, Nazi dead.
4027435	4027795	Exactly.
4027835	4030737	They have material to work with.
4030797	4032098	They've got a good source.
4033338	4044484	One of the biggest things that bugs me about... Yeah, but Saving Private Ryan, it's not... One of the things that bugs me about movies made from video games is where they take...
4046021	4046641	SILENT HILL
4071641	4073222	I would have thrown her off the cliff myself.
4073242	4074662	I think she just said it twice.
4075002	4075983	But low, and that was a lot.
4076003	4077884	What was it she had her dream?
4077944	4082386	I'd like to point out, Silent Hill did have Pyramid Head ripping somebody's skin off, so it did deliver.
4083146	4084467	That was the fan service.
4084827	4085287	Exactly.
4086247	4088668	He made the shouty bitch shut up.
4090029	4091890	And the very end of it, too, when they killed the Borg Queen.
4092110	4093430	They need Silent Hill 2.
4093490	4094751	Pyramid Head rapes everyone.
4095214	4095615	No!
4096998	4097239	No.
4097499	4098621	Now I need dream movies.
4099123	4100065	Oh my god.
4100846	4101207	No.
4101307	4103692	Yes, Pyramid Head gets set loose on the streets of San Diego.
4104272	4105152	Silent Hill 6 The Roommate
4128482	4138224	You can actually have where it could be like a comedy, like a sitcom, you know, where some guy ends up getting this roommate because he needs an apartment and can't find any other places to rent.
4138684	4141025	And that roommate happens to be Pyramid Head.
4141105	4142525	And oh, hilarity ensues.
4142885	4146186	That sounds like it would be a cheesy YouTube series.
4146206	4146686	Pyramid Head.
4146826	4149207	Oh, man, you're leaving skins of corpses around.
4149227	4149587	What the hell?
4149727	4150648	Take WD-40 to that rusty head
4175458	4176078	Yeah, I don't know.
4176398	4177059	Anyway, but no.
4177719	4179639	Paint a face on it like Jack.
4179739	4183921	Okay, you realize I'm going to go home and draw this now, right?
4184401	4184801	Oh dear.
4185061	4187502	But anyway, but no, but do you get my point?
4188762	4188942	Yes.
4189223	4200926	Is that if they're taking something that there are already an established fan base for, I understand wanting to get more people than just the fan base to see it, but they need to stay true to their core material.
4200946	4202107	That's why I'm actually kind of...
4203402	4209768	I'm feeling actually kind of good about them doing a movie for this series because you've got something established and easy to work with, I think.
4210469	4214552	Something that there's not really too much room to fuck it up unless you let, you know, Uwe Boll do it.
4214993	4216034	Well, we'll see what happens.
4217369	4226633	Well, I don't really know how to translate, or I should say, kind of move over to this story, but hey, let's talk about something completely different, I guess.
4227373	4228273	How about something local?
4228634	4229554	Yeah, something local.
4229754	4230174	Local news.
4230194	4230594	What?
4231115	4234856	Yes, apparently someone is acknowledging Stockton, California.
4235056	4235336	Why?
4235796	4236137	I don't know.
4236617	4242859	Because apparently they wrote an article about, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 and how it's making people crazy.
4243239	4245840	But apparently, according to the Stockton record...
4247560	4248761	They have a couple quotes here.
4249121	4262146	My son Peter was never really aggressive, but once he got into the video games, GTA being one of them, he started to push, hit, talk back, and just become a different person, said Stockton parent Greg Within.
4262847	4263847	His last name is Within.
4263987	4264507	That's kind of weird.
4266188	4269310	And it doesn't really say how old his son is.
4269510	4272511	I know people that are letting their 8-year-old son play these games, so...
4273876	4299221	Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty 4 I don't get it and then anyways there's another one this other guy who's 19 said he was involved in an altercation a week after he purchased Grand Theft Auto 4 he says at the time he noticed that he had become less sensitive to violence Grand Theft Auto 4 tearing a neighborhood apart and the 19 year old says it didn't completely blame the game for his violence but it did affect him
4300413	4300813	I don't know.
4300833	4301654	It sounds retarded.
4302054	4313060	It's covered on GamePolitics and you can also find it at RecordNet.com which is the official Stockton newspaper's website.
4313921	4317703	And yes, Stockton is like the butthole of the Sacramento area.
4318343	4319744	It's not even Sacramento area.
4319824	4325487	It's more like... That space between Sacramento and LA that you drive down on the freeway.
4326628	4329069	Or worse yet, that space between Sacramento and Fresno.
4332324	4336505	And you can blame Jesse... They do have a good arcade there, though.
4337366	4340947	Corona, as... The author of the original article.
4340967	4344448	Yes, as Grand Theft Auto 4, criticized by Stockonians.
4344988	4345969	Stockonians!
4347149	4347209	Wow!
4347369	4348370	Is that what they call themselves?
4348890	4349670	That's retarded.
4351451	4352811	We should go to Stockton, why?
4369485	4370646	And don't they have an S-Mart?
4370966	4371907	Only if we get to know.
4372027	4373008	Yes, they do have an S-Mart.
4373628	4375469	I have to comment on it every time we go by there.
4375690	4376470	And you know something else?
4376490	4378352	They actually spell it out, Save Mart, now.
4378532	4378992	Oh, shoot.
4379012	4388779	And you know something that's pretty funny, though, too, is this story right here is basically written about the launch day of Grand Theft Auto 4, yet it's coming out a month afterwards.
4388979	4390901	I mean, talk about trying to fill space.
4392162	4392362	Sorry.
4393719	4400423	Let's see, SSJ100 in chat says, I heard a mother say she got the game for her kid because he was being made fun of in school for not having the game.
4400804	4401804	Meanwhile, the kid was 12.
4403425	4404366	Stupid.
4405466	4407548	Kids don't get made fun of for anything.
4407728	4412951	The color of their hair, their name, the clothes they wear, the way they walk, talk, behave.
4414792	4415873	Just get over it.
4416013	4417054	That's school for you.
4417494	4418114	Well, guess what?
4418174	4420536	I have some more Grand Theft Auto 4 related news.
4426482	4430911	Benny Hill's coming to, uh, no, it's, uh, actually has to do with, uh, kind of an idiot.
4431733	4434178	And it has to do with a 13-year-old boy...
4436230	4441735	And we can't give out his name because he's only 13, but if we could, he would win this week's Stupid Award.
4442496	4446339	This is coming from the police, Paul Shastani.
4446599	4450162	He's a lieutenant of a Massachusetts police force.
4450523	4461352	It was a male 13-year-old, and what he did, he stayed after class when other students had left the classroom, and then pulled an 11-inch knife on the teacher and asked for 20 bucks.
4462950	4465792	When the teacher refused, he lowered his demand to $1.
4465832	4466393	Give me a dollar!
4471158	4473320	The teacher then took the knife from the student.
4473340	4476503	It doesn't explain how that happened, but the teacher was able to get the knife away from the student.
4476563	4477544	And just like punched him.
4477784	4478865	But no, no, here's the thing.
4479205	4489674	The police said the boy wanted to buy the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but his mother had refused to give him the money, so he came up with an alternate plan.
4490194	4494919	So first off, why was the kid trying to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, dude?
4494939	4496180	That game's been out for like years.
4497140	4498241	Maybe he only has a PlayStation 2.
4499432	4502713	Apparently his mom's a bitch for not buying him any violent video games.
4502733	4507074	I guess that makes sense, because I think it's cheaper now, so only $20 might cover that game.
4508254	4512895	Actually, it would, and it'd be slightly short with tax, so it sucks for him.
4513335	4519417	But the moral of the story is, this guy sucks, and his parents kind of suck for letting him get away with this.
4520597	4521157	So there you have it.
4523268	4529272	And then, of course, whenever we hear these types of stories and get out stupid words, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.
4529852	4531553	And when I get angsty, people die.
4531993	4533294	Oh, and the FUs of the week happen.
4539117	4540879	Oh, this is bad.
4541099	4542680	Here is justice.
4542740	4544320	Here is punishment.
4544381	4546182	I mean, seriously, San Andreas?
4546202	4547582	This is fucked up.
4549103	4551925	You know, I don't really think I'm angsty about anything right now.
4553792	4554573	Make something up.
4556154	4558637	F you to my digestive system.
4559377	4559678	Okay.
4560639	4563161	For killing me softly with Ipsong.
4564883	4565944	Thank you, Roberta Flack.
4566704	4567305	Uh, Loki.
4567905	4569687	Uh, F you to Monster Mini Golf.
4569847	4572930	It's this chain of mini, indoor mini golf places.
4573311	4576333	Um, they opened one up here in Rancho Cordova.
4576353	4577755	I wanna go there, does it suck?
4578297	4578897	It does suck.
4579157	4583899	It's at the Nimbus Winery.
4584360	4585660	Here's my problem with it.
4586000	4589202	First off, they just put no thought into the course design whatsoever.
4589322	4591703	It kind of goes around there in a giant maze.
4592843	4597805	There are no barriers from one hole to the next, so you don't know where one course begins and another one ends.
4598526	4603248	And you practically have to search the course to find the hole that you're supposed to be knocking the ball into.
4604187	4610110	So they spent little time on the course, but they have all these cool props that are like all pneumatic and stuff like that that are really cool.
4611150	4615192	But really, I mean, indoor mini golf in this area would be a fucking awesome idea.
4615352	4617433	It's just, why isn't anyone doing it right?
4617513	4626757	I mean, if I had the money to set up something like that, I would at least put a few seconds thought into the actual course instead of just throwing some shit together.
4627678	4628478	I will not be going back.
4630770	4634972	I give an F you to driving home at 2.30 in the morning and falling asleep at the wheel.
4635412	4637353	But thankfully, somebody else was there to take over.
4637393	4642015	I didn't drive unsafe, but just F you to the fact that I thought I'd be able to stay up at night.
4642075	4642576	I couldn't.
4642956	4643636	I couldn't do it.
4644577	4645537	F you to me being weak.
4646704	4669636	Alright, one thing that we will not be giving an F you to because it's awesome is classic video games that we love and adore and we're about ready to wrap up part A but we can't do it until we pay some respect to our elders and we do that by asking the one and only DarkSakura to dig through the archives of games every week and pick out one of her favorites to be featured as the OLR Classic Game of the Week.
4669656	4671737	DarkSakura, what should the kids be checking out this week?
4672859	4682281	It's a little game called Ghouls and Ghosts, also called Dai Makai Mura, which is really, really, you know, it's Ghouls and Ghosts.
4682301	4683602	How can you go wrong with that?
4683662	4684422	It's classic.
4685102	4686763	Hence, classic game of the week.
4687223	4688763	Anyway.
4688823	4690123	Okay, the music is the best.
4693164	4693564	Okay.
4703604	4721291	Okay, anyway, you play as a knight called Arthur who has to go through a bunch of really friggin' tough stages to go rescue his woman and save a soul by Lucifer.
4722392	4726833	And I think it's funny that his bride is named Princess Prin Prin.
4727154	4727974	That's really hilarious.
4728454	4730936	But anyway, you pick up different weapons on the way.
4730976	4735058	And actually, this is a sequel to Makai Mura, which was Ghosts and Goblins over here.
4735859	4742523	And the change between this one to the last one is that you can fire up and jump and fire.
4745025	4746306	But you also get different weapons.
4746326	4747867	Never use the sword.
4747947	4748567	It sucks.
4750151	4751171	You want to get the lances.
4751471	4752072	The holy water.
4752452	4752732	Okay.
4753372	4762475	But, um, you've also got different enemies that show up, like, you know, a bunch of demon-y things, and a magician that every so often will either turn him into an old man or a duck.
4763555	4764356	Yeah.
4764376	4771578	You also get, you know, your gold armor, so you get your charge attack and one extra, I guess, hit that you can take.
4772058	4776060	The really hard part about this game is that you do have a limited number of hits you can take.
4776920	4776980	Um...
4778680	4779521	Thank you for watching!
4794639	4799285	You literally just collapse into skulls and bones, which is kind of funny.
4799385	4810380	Amiga, Armstrong, CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Saturn, which I have that copy and I actually bought it at a Babbage's.
4811886	4820232	So I bought it at an American retailer, I think it's hilarious, because it was only on the Capcom Generations that they brought out in Japan.
4820852	4828678	It came out on PlayStation Super Graphics, Master System, Genesis, Virtual Console release, and the ZX Spectrum.
4829638	4835222	But it's really freaking fun, and also this game, and I'm going to spoil it for everyone.
4835603	4837944	It's only been out, you know, 20 years.
4838064	4840006	Oh my god, it's been out 20 years, it was released in 19...
4840666	4842867	Okay, as of December, it will be out 20 years.
4843047	4843287	Okay.
4844568	4845809	It was released in December 1988.
4847390	4850551	But... I had a point.
4852713	4853613	Okay.
4854033	4857095	Just to spoil the ending, when you get to the end of the game, you have to do it again.
4857115	4858956	It's like, oh, guess what?
4859096	4861097	Remember all that sweating that you did to get through this game?
4862638	4863098	We lied.
4863178	4863698	No ending.
4863738	4864219	Do it again.
4865039	4868521	And so you have to go through the whole thing all over again.
4869742	4870682	Sadistic.
4871162	4873984	I know, really evil.
4874644	4881567	It also did have a sequel to it, which in my opinion was disappointing with Super Ghouls N' Ghosts.
4881627	4888090	It did have a very epic opening, and it was really freaking hard, but I don't think that it was as much fun as this one.
4888650	4895734	And then the one that drove me crazy at E3 two years ago, hunting down, and then they kicked me off of playing it, was Ultimate Ghosts N' Goblins.
4896674	4897774	which is a PSP release.
4897894	4901535	And it was actually really fun and just as frickin' hard as all the other of them.
4902176	4904796	So... That's your game.
4905196	4906017	That is the game.
4906417	4909338	So if you can beat this game, you have a very big EP-ing.
4910058	4910658	If you can beat this game.
4910678	4911158	I've beaten the game.
4911518	4912799	Then your EP-ing is very big.
4912859	4915359	I've seen my husband beat it on one credit.
4915899	4916800	That's crazy.
4917620	4920581	I've seen him beat a number of games on one... I've seen him beat R-Type on one credit.
4920681	4921061	Yikes.
4921932	4923733	Alright, well there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, folks.
4923893	4927455	Ghouls and Ghosts on like a million different systems.
4927735	4928496	So, check it out.
4929116	4932578	The system you would urge, though, I'm sure has got to be the Sega one, right?
4932858	4936780	Well, Saturn has the Arcade Perfect version.
4937241	4942664	However, if you're going to get it for any of the home systems, and it says Virtual Console as well, get the Genesis version.
4943464	4944845	Honestly, for any of the...
4945489	4948191	I didn't mind the Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
4949311	4954234	I know you're not a fan, but... And honestly, and this is my problem because I was always a Super Nintendo fangirl.
4954254	4958116	And I actually do like Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
4958156	4959017	Don't get me wrong at all.
4959097	4960038	I like the game.
4960178	4962359	It's just, it was a bit of a letdown.
4962839	4963259	Not as good.
4963279	4969183	It's like, you know, it's comparing vanilla ice cream to chocolate peanut butter ice cream.
