7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	16000	Tonight, June 1st, 2008.
16000	19000	Could achievement like trophies be coming to PlayStation Network?
19000	22000	A homebrew version of Portal shows up on the DS.
22000	25000	And could a video game soon teach you to stop smoking?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	42000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	44000	And occasionally food.
44000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me is always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	51000	I had a hamburger.
51000	53000	It was delicious.
53000	55000	My husband cooked it.
55000	57000	He had Worcestershire sauce cooked into it.
57000	62000	Every time I hear Worcestershire sauce I think of that one episode of South Park.
62000	65000	Forget it.
65000	67000	I watched the end of the Imaginationland episode.
67000	69000	That was kind of cool.
69000	71000	Worcestershire sauce was like a long time ago.
71000	73000	I had to do zombies.
73000	75000	Does that look like pink eye?
75000	77000	Sorry.
77000	80000	If the Worcestershire sauce is cost you to become a zombie.
80000	82000	I don't remember what it was.
82000	84000	Forget it.
84000	86000	My burger was great.
86000	88000	I have to tell everybody about this because it was really delicious.
88000	90000	I had wheat bun and a little bit of mayonnaise.
90000	92000	I put garlic on the bun.
92000	94000	Like chopped garlic.
94000	98000	And mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese.
98000	100000	And it was a delicious burger.
100000	102000	It was tasty.
102000	104000	I also have Guinness but I don't think I like beer anymore.
104000	106000	Guinness isn't beer thankfully.
106000	111000	I think I just lost my taste for a lot of alcoholic beverages.
111000	113000	For now.
113000	115000	I had a good food week too yesterday.
115000	118000	I've had to really eat a lot of very bland low fat food.
118000	120000	Thanks to the pancreas issues I had a couple weeks ago.
120000	123000	Whereas the bright side is I've lost almost 30 pounds now.
123000	126000	And haven't even had to play an ounce of Wii Fit.
126000	129000	The downside is I don't get to eat food I like.
129000	132000	But yesterday we were driving to the bay.
132000	134000	And I got to go buy one of my favorite places in the entire world.
134000	136000	Mary's Pizza Shack.
136000	138000	I love that place.
138000	141000	I actually ate like a pasta dish and the bread.
141000	143000	And I seem to be okay.
143000	147000	I found something that I think you might be able to partake of at California Pizza Kitchen.
147000	149000	What's that?
149000	152000	Is it if you have them do light cheese on your pizza and get the wheat crust?
152000	154000	Might not be bad.
154000	156000	You should be able to get away with pizza every now and again.
156000	158000	But you can make it yourself.
158000	160000	And I will give you recipes but not on the air.
160000	162000	Alright.
162000	164000	Yes because we do have video games to get to.
164000	166000	Also say hello to the other co-host, Loki.
166000	168000	I'm three minutes into the show and I hadn't introduced you yet.
168000	170000	I'm so sorry but food, Loki, food.
170000	172000	I'm so tired today.
172000	174000	Are you tired?
174000	176000	I don't know why I just feel all drained.
176000	178000	Like I have no energy.
178000	180000	Is it like lethargic tired?
180000	182000	Like I have a birthday coming soon.
182000	184000	I'm getting older.
184000	186000	I literally feel like I have no energy.
186000	188000	It's weird.
188000	190000	Speaking of food, I saw this thing on the Food Network actually.
190000	192000	It's a local place.
192000	194000	It's a dive called the Squeeze Inn.
194000	196000	I think I have actually.
196000	201000	Well they have a burger that's a third a pound of beef with a third a pound of cheese on it.
201000	204000	And it's just huge.
204000	206000	I have to eat that.
206000	209000	That sounds like too much.
209000	211000	It literally is.
211000	214000	Like you have the patty and then there's like an extra inch of cheese around the outside.
214000	216000	Is that a knife and fork burger?
216000	218000	No.
218000	220000	Alright, anyhow.
220000	222000	Look, enough food.
222000	226000	Alright guys, I do want to introduce the ever present other host on our show.
226000	228000	You, the chatters.
228000	230000	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to join our chat room.
230000	233000	Or of course you can wait until we open up the Skype line later in the show.
233000	236000	There's our mailbag that's already pretty full this week.
236000	238000	But if you do want to send an email you can do that.
238000	240000	Mailbag.OrangeLawnTrader.com
240000	244000	I did peek in there a little bit at the mailbag and you can check it out during part B.
244000	247000	I noticed for the most part a lot of the emails are getting a lot shorter.
247000	249000	So props to our listeners.
249000	253000	That's because Jamie gets laryngitis every time she tries to read them.
253000	255000	So it's good. We have some short emails this week.
255000	257000	So that's good.
257000	260000	I wanted to point out some comments in chat.
260000	262000	At chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com
262000	264000	Dark Tetsuya was expressing surprise.
264000	266000	What? Jamie doesn't like beer anymore?
266000	268000	Wow.
268000	270000	It's not really so much that I don't like it.
270000	272000	It's just that...
274000	276000	I'll go ahead and say this right now.
276000	279000	In the past couple of weeks, like I was telling you earlier today,
279000	282000	I've been having digestion problems of my own.
282000	286000	And beer has been making me very pained.
286000	289000	Well alcohol is just bad for your digestion system in general.
289000	291000	It is.
291000	294000	I will probably not be able to drink alcohol for like a year if ever again.
294000	296000	I think I mentioned this on last week's show.
296000	298000	But it's not the end of the world.
298000	301000	I found I'm okay with a little bit of wine.
301000	305000	But beer itself...
305000	310000	I can have like say a bottle of Newcastle.
310000	312000	I can have a pint of Newcastle.
312000	314000	And I'll feel uncomfortable by the time I'm done with it
314000	317000	when I used to be able to kick back a six pack all on my own with no problem.
317000	319000	Getting old sucks.
319000	322000	No. This has happened all within the last couple of weeks.
322000	326000	Amae Satsuma in chat says cheeseburger, one of our common chatters,
326000	330000	cheeseburger may have to change your name to Dark Sakura's poo in a few hours.
330000	333000	Gross.
333000	336000	That's the other reason I actually ate my cheeseburger
336000	338000	is I'm experimenting with my food
338000	340000	because I'm actually writing down everything I eat
340000	343000	so I can see what hurts.
343000	345000	Dark Sakura gave me that look of...
345000	347000	Why did you read that comment?
347000	353000	Geekboy2424 says that he just recently watched the YouTube video this week
353000	355000	of Loki drunk playing Mario Kart.
355000	357000	Remember when we have a YouTube channel and there's things like that?
357000	360000	That was you at your bachelor party quite some time ago playing Mario Kart drunk.
360000	361000	Good times.
361000	364000	I'm hoping that we'll have more things on YouTube soon.
364000	366000	The bad news is that we have no webcam tonight.
366000	368000	There's no Justin TV.
368000	373000	The webcam broke and so the audio doesn't work anymore
373000	376000	and yeah, I can use the built-in speaker on the Mac
376000	378000	but listening to last week's show, it sucked.
378000	380000	So here's the thing though.
380000	382000	I've picked out the video camera I want to get
382000	385000	and the good news is that the video camera can also double as a webcam
385000	389000	but it can also be a video camera to go out and shoot more shenanigans.
389000	397000	You should get that one that they had at the lounge that all games used to be in
397000	399000	where they could control it and turn it and stuff.
399000	401000	No, it's not a webcam. It's an actual video camera.
401000	403000	Remember, it's not porn unless you tape it.
403000	408000	Yeah, and then I can also start my amateur porn studio with my new video camera.
408000	409000	No, just kidding.
409000	411000	Alright, okay.
411000	414000	Let's go ahead and get into How Was Your Gaming Week,
414000	418000	how we always like to start off the show even though we're like seven minutes into tonight's show.
418000	420000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
420000	422000	Poor. It was poor.
422000	423000	Sorry to hear that.
423000	425000	Actually, I had drama this week.
425000	428000	I had to kick a pinball machine to break into my own house.
428000	429000	Nice.
429000	432000	That story is for later but anyway.
432000	437000	I've been getting on My Husband because he's supposed to be getting me The World Ends With You
437000	439000	and every time he says he's going to do it,
439000	441000	oh, the store doesn't have it.
441000	445000	So you can't go to another.
445000	449000	Okay, then I'll have to suffer.
449000	450000	Evil man.
450000	454000	So The World Ends With Dan.
454000	460000	But, but, but, but, but I did have a really, really awesome game of World Cup soccer pinball.
460000	461000	Excellent.
461000	463000	And he's working on our Black Knight 2000. I'm so happy.
463000	464000	Sweet.
464000	466000	You were telling me a funny story about Grand Theft Auto.
466000	467000	I don't know if you want to talk about it now or later.
467000	468000	Oh, fuck. Okay.
468000	469000	It's funny.
469000	474000	Okay, I was watching Will play and Will is Dan's pretty much his best buddy.
474000	475000	BFF.
475000	476000	Yeah.
476000	481000	Anyway, I was watching him play right before I left.
481000	485000	It just like as I was leaving with my hamburger in hand.
485000	489000	He was ordering from Burger King in the game.
489000	492000	And we were talking about shot or whatever the crap it is.
492000	494000	Burger hell.
494000	496000	So we were talking about falling down, though.
496000	497000	You know that movie?
497000	499000	What was who is with Kurt Russell?
499000	500000	Michael Douglas.
500000	501000	Michael Douglas.
501000	505000	Kurt Russell. Yeah, Michael, because we were watching that South Park episode.
505000	508000	Anyway, the Stargate thing, you know?
508000	515000	Anyway, so we were making references to falling down and I was like,
515000	517000	you should just shoot her.
517000	520000	He's like, no, I need my burger so I can regain my health.
520000	524000	I was like, well, then eat your burger and then shoot her.
524000	528000	So he gets his burger, holds out the gun and she's like, oh, shit.
528000	533000	I guess it's like they instantly go into this panic deer in the headlights look.
533000	536000	And I would do I mean, I've had a gun pointed at my face before.
536000	537000	So I know the the thing.
537000	541000	And then he shoots her and then like five other people pull up behind him and pull out guns.
541000	544000	Like, I'm leaving. Bye.
544000	551000	And then and then he also made a motorcycle appear from nowhere and promptly crashed it.
551000	554000	And his friend landed on his head and we thought he died, but he got up.
554000	557000	I was like, your friend's really thick.
557000	563000	So I part of me does want to pick up Grand Theft Auto just for the lols alone and think in situations like that.
563000	566000	But I just I have this bad feeling it'll wear off quickly.
566000	568000	I get more amusement watching other people play it.
568000	573000	You just have to remember, Grand Theft Auto is not usually my thing, you know, but I guess I really should.
573000	576000	I enjoyed watching Loki play it, so I should probably get it.
576000	580000	We'll see. The multiplayer is probably fun, too.
580000	583000	Let's see. What did somebody say in chat here?
583000	588000	Oh, SGA 100 Matt says Jamie gets into her house by playing pinball. Awesome security system.
588000	590000	OK, OK, OK, OK. The story.
590000	594000	Real quick. I got locked out of my house yesterday.
594000	599000	OK, I have this little pouch on the side of my purse. I put my keys and then my keys fell out.
599000	601000	So I get outside, shut the security door.
601000	605000	You make sure it's locked and then realize when I'm reaching in my purse, I do not have my keys on me.
605000	608000	And Dan can't leave the store to come help me in.
608000	615000	I can't get a hold of anybody who either A has the keys to some part of my house or can take me to go get Dan's.
615000	622000	So I'm going around the house and I found out that one of the screens actually didn't have the little protective tab in it, which we are going to remedy.
622000	627000	And I got the screen out, climbed up on this chair that we have outside for some unknown reason.
627000	631000	Had to contort to freaking get in the window because I'm still too short and slid down a pinball machine.
631000	636000	We know the only window that I could get in was the one that Dan has the no fear pinball backed up against.
636000	638000	So I had to actually push it.
638000	643000	And then I was like, I'm too short to jump down from here because you know how tall those windows are in the pinball room.
643000	644000	Right.
644000	646000	So I made it down and then had to push the pinball machine back.
646000	649000	And I thought I broke a leg of the pinball machine, not mine.
649000	651000	I thought I broke my ankle though.
651000	652000	And then it was just really bad.
652000	655000	I've got everything back in order and now the house is once again impregnable.
655000	657000	But still.
657000	658000	All right.
658000	660000	Please, please do not be breaking into Dark Soccer's house.
660000	661000	OK, thanks.
661000	662000	No, because I'll kill you.
662000	663000	All right.
663000	666000	Well, with the fish.
666000	668000	Well, I feel like more Grand Theft Auto 4.
668000	669000	Of course.
669000	672000	Well, I'm just working towards 100% stuff.
672000	673000	Did you shoot anyone in the face?
673000	674000	Yes.
674000	675000	All right.
675000	677000	I'm pretty sure I did.
677000	681000	Anyways, so I finished all the pigeons.
681000	683000	I killed all the pigeons.
683000	685000	I did all the stunt jumps today.
685000	690000	And now I'm doing the random friends, I guess is what they call it.
690000	692000	But it's random people you meet on the street.
692000	693000	They have different missions.
693000	696000	But I can't give this one the trigger because I think I passed it up somewhere.
696000	697000	I don't know.
697000	701000	So that's kind of annoying because if I can't get the trigger, then I can't get 100%.
701000	703000	And that would really suck.
703000	705000	And then I played this game.
705000	709000	It's a demo for a game called Crash Time because I thought, hey, this is going to be cool.
709000	713000	It's like a European game that looks really cheesy and it was cheap.
713000	715000	And I tried it out and it's not very good.
715000	718000	It's basically like an arcade chase game.
718000	723000	You are the police and you have to do different things like they'll have it where you have
723000	729000	to do 30% damage to the person you're chasing and make them stop for 3 seconds or something
729000	730000	like that.
730000	732000	So I tried that and I just didn't care for it.
732000	733000	It's kind of dumb.
733000	738000	Nothing will replace my Earth Defense Force 2017.
738000	741000	And then, let's see.
741000	744000	You know, actually I think that was about it for my gaming week.
744000	748000	Pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.
748000	750000	I don't think I played anything else.
750000	751000	Nice.
751000	752000	Alright.
752000	754000	Well, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
754000	757000	I played more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted to Warcraft.
757000	758000	Got it.
758000	759000	Thank you.
759000	760000	You're welcome.
760000	764000	But I would like to announce that our guild finally full cleared Karazhan this week.
764000	766000	We did a full clear of Karazhan.
766000	768000	You have to be a WoW nerd to understand what that means.
768000	771000	So that's a full clear on Kara and one boss down in Zolomon.
771000	776000	Considering there aren't 25 of us to run the big raids, we have to do the little raids,
776000	777000	it's great.
777000	780000	And I'm very excited at the news that Wrath of the Lich King is going to have 10 man's
780000	782000	equivalent to every 25 man.
782000	783000	That makes me very happy.
783000	785000	Anyhow, enough WoW nerddom.
785000	786000	I did play some other games this week.
786000	793000	I downloaded a new game from the Steam service which, as you know, is kind of like PC's answer
793000	794000	to Xbox Live, I guess you could say.
794000	796000	It's made by Valve.
796000	798000	The company did the orange box and all that stuff.
798000	800000	They sell a lot of other games on there, some independent games.
800000	803000	I decided to check out Audiosurf.
803000	807000	It had been recommended to me before because it's a music game, basically.
807000	810000	You know, we here at Orange Toms Radio, we love music games.
810000	811000	It's a big part of our history.
811000	812000	So I thought, why not?
812000	813000	I'm going to check this out.
813000	814000	So Audiosurf's kind of interesting.
814000	819000	From looks alone, I thought it was going to be a game like Amplitude just because it was
819000	827000	that whole traveling down a course with all the sci-fi looking things around.
827000	830000	Kind of the very similar look to what you saw in frequency of Amplitude.
830000	833000	But the gameplay itself was much different.
833000	838000	The gameplay is more like, do you remember an old school puzzle game called Klax?
838000	842000	From the early 90's, that game Klax?
842000	847000	In Klax, there were these little things that would go down a conveyor belt, these little colored blocks.
847000	850000	What you had to do is you had to put the colored blocks three in a row.
850000	853000	Either across, down, or diagonally.
853000	861000	That's kind of what Audiosurf is, except it moves much faster and the colored blocks kind of go in time with music.
861000	864000	But the music is any MP3 you want.
864000	870000	It's any MP3 you want or any iTunes file you want as long as it's not a protected file.
870000	875000	You can't use iTunes purchase files, but you can use things that you've encoded in iTunes that aren't protected.
875000	878000	And it plays a wide variety of stuff.
878000	882000	And it's kind of neat because the game does come with its own soundtrack.
882000	886000	It comes with the Orange Box soundtrack because, hello, it's Valve.
886000	889000	So you can play Still Alive and Audiosurf to your heart's content.
889000	892000	But here's one thing I thought was kind of interesting about Audiosurf.
892000	902000	As you're playing the game, in the results screen that comes up, it will still show you leaderboards for the song you played.
902000	906000	In other words, it doesn't matter what song you played from your library.
906000	916000	The servers, I guess, keep track of all the file names or it must be some type of algorithm between file name and the way the music file was read by the game.
916000	919000	Probably the CD database, how they have those.
919000	921000	Possibly, but it's not really playing off a CD either.
921000	926000	But it'll take it off the MD5 hash or whatever.
926000	927000	Yeah, kind of something like that.
927000	935000	So I thought that was really cool because I played an Echo Image song, which Echo Image is kind of an obscure band unless you're really familiar with the DDR series.
935000	937000	Or Synthpop in general.
937000	941000	And to my surprise, there were a couple other people that had played the same song I did.
941000	943000	So I thought that was kind of neat the way they had the leaderboards in that game.
943000	945000	And then you can have your own friends list and all that good stuff.
945000	949000	And Steam has its own achievements-like thing that you can do in Audiosurf.
949000	958000	But here's the other thing about Audiosurf is that not only did it have the clax-style gameplay, which is kind of cool because it reads the file in advance.
958000	961000	And the track is kind of like a giant roller coaster.
961000	967000	And during the really intense part of the songs, you're going straight downhill and you're going really fast.
967000	969000	And you have to collect these blocks really fast.
969000	975000	And then during the more slow build-up parts of the songs, like the song Skulk by Echo Image.
975000	979000	During that little tiny instrumental part, it's building up.
979000	981000	I'm not going to try to sing it.
981000	984000	You're climbing uphill slowly and the blocks are coming in slowly.
984000	989000	And then when it really builds up to the really hard part of the song.
989000	991000	Understand me now.
991000	995000	That whole part, you're going downhill like 100 miles an hour and you have to collect blocks really fast.
995000	996000	Cool.
996000	997000	It's cool.
997000	1002000	But the thing is that you can pick different types of ships as well that you can control.
1002000	1004000	And it kind of changes the core element of the game.
1004000	1012000	Like if the clax thing is too confusing for you, there's like a simple ship that you can pick where the blocks are either gray or they're colored.
1012000	1015000	And it is collect colored blocks, avoid gray blocks.
1015000	1017000	It makes it very easy.
1017000	1019000	And you can kind of step up the different types.
1019000	1023000	Or you can do like a ship that will shuffle the colors occasionally.
1023000	1025000	Or a ship where you can hold blocks.
1025000	1026000	It's kind of neat.
1026000	1028000	I really enjoyed the game.
1028000	1039000	The only thing is that I didn't think a lot of times the music making algorithm that made the tracks and the blocks wasn't often really in time with the music.
1039000	1047000	You're not going to have something as spot on as Beatmania 2DX or DDR or Rockband or any of those things that are pre-programmed for the songs in it.
1047000	1056000	But I cut it a little slack because considering you can play any song in the world, there's only so much you can do to get it accurate.
1056000	1064000	And for what it's worth, I did think the uphill downhill things, like it's very good at detecting lots of volume, little volume and kind of building the course that way.
1064000	1066000	So I give it props for that.
1066000	1069000	And I would recommend it to the game because it's only $10.
1069000	1070000	So there you have it.
1070000	1078000	And if you want to, you can hopefully hope that this game is going to come out on Xbox Live because there's rumors that the game might be coming out on Xbox Live.
1078000	1081000	And I think that's a really good place for it, is Xbox Live.
1081000	1082000	But here's the problem.
1082000	1089000	I think the reason why it works so well as a PC game is the fact that you can use any MP3 you want or any song you want directly from your drive.
1089000	1093000	Yes, on Xbox you can import your own music files, yeah.
1093000	1096000	But do the masses really know how to do that?
1096000	1098000	Probably not so much.
1098000	1102000	So I don't know how successful the game would be on Xbox Live, but I'd still be all for it.
1102000	1108000	I mean, it's not like there aren't other games that do use the extended soundtrack, every extended extra extreme.
1108000	1109000	Hello.
1109000	1110000	So there you have it.
1110000	1112000	Let's see, reading some commented chats.
1112000	1118000	Gold Banjo asks, Sky, can't people just edit the ID3 tags and cheat the leaderboards?
1118000	1122000	Gold Banjo, I don't think so because the leaderboards are independent for each song.
1122000	1125000	I didn't notice any type of comprehensive leaderboard.
1125000	1127000	So if you edit the ID3 tag, then you're on a new song.
1127000	1129000	I don't even think it's the ID3 tag.
1129000	1134000	I think it maybe just, they have, I think it's called an MD5 tag where it.
1134000	1139000	The way the algorithm's figured out is probably coded into some type of thing that is sent to the servers.
1139000	1140000	I have no idea.
1140000	1141000	No idea.
1141000	1145000	And really, are you cheating at a game that's like, I mean, come on.
1145000	1149000	Hitstun says, actually only looks at the artist and song title tags.
1149000	1154000	No hash checking is done and people cheat by playing 20 minute songs tagged to look like other songs.
1154000	1155000	Well, that's messed up.
1155000	1157000	So maybe Audio Surf needs to.
1157000	1158000	Yay, cheating.
1158000	1161000	Consider the length of the MP3 as well.
1161000	1162000	That would probably be a good idea.
1162000	1163000	So there you have it.
1163000	1165000	So Audio Surf, I liked.
1165000	1167000	And that was really the only new game I played this week.
1167000	1168000	Oh, I take that back.
1168000	1171000	I played that new Sudoku game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.
1171000	1175000	I'm sorry.
1175000	1176000	It's Sudoku, folks.
1176000	1181000	I mean, really, if you haven't played Sudoku and you're a big Sudoku fan.
1181000	1182000	Here's the thing.
1182000	1184000	I've abstained by choice.
1184000	1192000	I give Xbox Live props for trying to put games out there that are going to appeal to other people than just hardcore gamers.
1192000	1194000	But I don't know if this is it.
1194000	1195000	That's okay.
1195000	1196000	It'll be delisted soon.
1196000	1198000	It'll be delisted in six months anyway.
1198000	1201000	And then I played the Warlords game as well, which was, I'm sorry.
1201000	1205000	I had a little more fun with that because I remember the old school Warlords game, but they really kind of changed it.
1205000	1207000	And you can notice for yourself.
1207000	1209000	Play the new, because you can do the demo.
1209000	1212000	Play the evolved version versus the old version.
1212000	1214000	The way it works is kind of different.
1214000	1220000	The new version is more like Breakout, which, yeah, the old version was too, but the ways the castles were shaped were even different.
1220000	1221000	And I don't know.
1221000	1223000	It just plays a lot differently and not as fast.
1223000	1224000	It's weird.
1224000	1225000	No thanks.
1225000	1226000	I think I'll skip it.
1226000	1227000	It was weird.
1227000	1230000	I mean, at least it's only five bucks, and I bet Xbox Live is kind of fun.
1230000	1236000	But I think Warlords is one of those games you best remember as something that was at Chuck E. Cheese when you were a kid.
1236000	1239000	And sadly, this one I'm noticing about a lot of the retro titles on Xbox Live.
1239000	1241000	Like, I hate to say it.
1241000	1244000	I hate to say it, but Discs of Tron.
1244000	1249000	That was kind of disappointing to play on Xbox Live because that was one of those games that was best left in my childhood.
1249000	1250000	What can you do?
1250000	1251000	All right.
1251000	1255000	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into tonight's news.
1255000	1257000	Really only a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
1257000	1264000	And that is that if you are unaware, our sixth anniversary show is coming up in three weeks, if you can believe it or not.
1264000	1268000	Orange Lounge Radio started on June 23rd of 2002.
1268000	1272000	And so in about three weeks, we're going to be looking at our sixth anniversary show.
1272000	1275000	We have no idea what to do for our sixth anniversary.
1275000	1276000	None.
1276000	1278000	So if you have ideas, email them to us.
1278000	1280000	Don't shout them out in chat because I'll forget by tomorrow.
1280000	1287000	But send us emails or I made a thread on our Facebook forums because people were saying I don't give Facebook enough love.
1287000	1288000	So there you go.
1288000	1293000	If you go to Facebook and you look up the OL Army Club on there, we have a little thread going there, and I am watching it.
1293000	1294000	We're curious.
1294000	1296000	What do you want to see us do for our sixth anniversary?
1296000	1301000	And we'll see because the show has always been about the chatters and the listeners and interacting.
1301000	1302000	So why not?
1302000	1305000	We'll be your monkeys this anniversary within reason.
1305000	1309000	I mean, if the suggestion is naked show, that's probably not going to happen.
1309000	1310000	Okay, Actif.
1310000	1313000	We're not having a fuck show until we don't say we are.
1313000	1314000	Exactly.
1314000	1315000	The fuck show is a surprise.
1315000	1317000	First rule about fuck show.
1317000	1318000	You don't talk about fuck show.
1318000	1322000	And we haven't really made up any other rules beyond that because we have to have rules for that.
1322000	1323000	Yes.
1323000	1325000	So somebody has to moderate and all that fun stuff.
1325000	1326000	So we'll plan it.
1326000	1327000	Don't worry.
1327000	1328000	No, that's the first thing.
1328000	1330000	The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.
1330000	1331000	That's for sure.
1331000	1335000	Brad from Pod Culture says drunk fuck show.
1335000	1338000	I can't get drunk right now because of everything else going on.
1338000	1339000	All right.
1339000	1340000	Anyhow.
1340000	1342000	Okay, give you some LSD.
1342000	1344000	Oh, I could probably smoke pot.
1344000	1345000	I'd be okay.
1345000	1346000	You could.
1346000	1347000	Pots not fat.
1347000	1348000	No, drugs are bad.
1348000	1349000	Okay.
1349000	1350000	Drugs are bad.
1350000	1351000	Okay.
1351000	1352000	All right.
1352000	1353000	Forget it.
1353000	1354000	Let's get into some gaming news.
1354000	1355000	Please, Loki.
1355000	1356000	Save the show from drug talk.
1356000	1357000	All right.
1357000	1363000	This week there was an event being held in France for Ooby Days 2008 where they were
1363000	1368000	showing off a bunch of their titles and one that they showed off only in trailer form.
1368000	1372000	And it was kind of at the closing of the conference.
1372000	1375000	It's Beyond Good and Evil 2.
1375000	1380000	It's being reimagined now for the next gen consoles and I'd imagine probably the PC as
1380000	1381000	well.
1381000	1386000	And they had a little teaser trailer which you can see Uncle Page.
1386000	1387000	So I don't know.
1387000	1388000	It looks cool.
1388000	1390000	I never really played the first Beyond Good and Evil.
1390000	1394000	So I don't really know what to expect from this.
1394000	1397000	Beyond Good and Evil is one of those really like cult hits kind of thing.
1397000	1400000	So I know there's a lot of people very excited about this because I think a lot of people
1400000	1402000	didn't think it would ever happen.
1402000	1403000	So there you have it.
1403000	1404000	Looks good though.
1404000	1405000	All right.
1405000	1409000	Hopefully you'll probably find out more about this during E3.
1409000	1412000	That little pig guy thing kind of scared me.
1412000	1413000	Just so you know.
1413000	1414000	Did you see the pictures of that?
1414000	1415000	Yeah.
1415000	1416000	That was very scary.
1416000	1417000	That's Uncle Page.
1417000	1418000	Yeah.
1418000	1419000	That scared me.
1419000	1420000	Yeah.
1420000	1424000	Also coming to the PlayStation pretty soon because Beyond Good and Evil 2 is PS3, right?
1424000	1425000	All the next gen systems, right?
1425000	1426000	Yeah.
1426000	1427000	I think so.
1427000	1431000	Well, also coming to the PlayStation 3 sometime eventually will be home.
1431000	1432000	Sony Home.
1432000	1437000	Well, Ubisoft has announced that they are going to be doing something special for home.
1437000	1441000	They are going to be doing one of their events online.
1441000	1443000	Here's the thing.
1443000	1448000	In the PlayStation Home media and events space, they're going to be showing off all these
1448000	1450000	new Ubisoft titles.
1450000	1454000	Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, HAWX, Hawks or whatever.
1454000	1455000	Yeah.
1455000	1456000	Soulcalibur IV.
1456000	1457000	But here's the thing.
1457000	1459000	You can only get there if you have a closed beta account.
1459000	1460000	Soulcalibur IV?
1460000	1461000	That's weird.
1461000	1462000	Yeah.
1462000	1463000	That's not an Ubisoft title.
1463000	1464000	That's Namco.
1464000	1465000	I don't know why that's on the list.
1465000	1467000	I guess maybe that's sharing the space.
1467000	1468000	Who knows?
1468000	1469000	Huh.
1469000	1470000	But whatever.
1470000	1472000	There are these other games at least as well that are going to be in the space.
1472000	1473000	Well, that's cool.
1473000	1474000	Yeah.
1474000	1477000	Because I know right now it's only open closed or I should say it's closed beta right now.
1477000	1479000	So those are the only people that are able to enjoy that.
1479000	1485000	And prior to this, they did a recreation of the Sony, I think they call it PlayStation
1485000	1486000	Day.
1486000	1491000	So, they were kind of showing what it would look like for future events, which I think
1491000	1495000	is pretty cool that they have this whole interactive thing going on.
1495000	1498000	It's definitely a different way to approach it.
1498000	1499000	Kind of interesting.
1499000	1503000	I mean, since the rest of us can't go to E3 anymore because we're not in the cool kids
1503000	1508000	club, you know, we could go to E3 in home, which I think is kind of interesting.
1508000	1511000	You know, the more I think of it, the more I don't really care that we're in the good
1511000	1513000	graces of publishers.
1513000	1516000	Because we get to say whatever we want in the show.
1516000	1517000	Exactly.
1517000	1518000	I don't mind either.
1518000	1519000	So, screw it.
1519000	1520000	Yeah.
1520000	1522000	The hell with them.
1522000	1526000	We can say something sucks as much as we want to.
1526000	1527000	Exactly.
1527000	1530000	And you know, if we want to review Metal Gear Solid 4 early, we can.
1530000	1534000	So, Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake is old.
1534000	1537000	And we'll talk about the hard drive space all we want.
1537000	1538000	Yeah.
1538000	1540000	That's probably why we don't have advanced screeners.
1540000	1542000	Yeah, that's probably why we don't get advanced screeners.
1542000	1545000	Guess what's coming out, though, on the Japanese PlayStation Store.
1545000	1546000	What?
1546000	1547000	This is on the 26th of June.
1547000	1552000	And when I read this, my response was, LOL what?
1552000	1554000	They're doing a gardening game.
1554000	1562000	It's called Shiki Tei and basically you go outside and plant trees and plant flowers
1562000	1565000	and watch them grow.
1565000	1574000	And it's supposed to be 1600 yen and it's supposed to be relaxing for the older gamer.
1574000	1576000	There's no word if we're ever getting it.
1576000	1579000	But I was just like, what?
1579000	1583000	And it made me think about the Saturn game that came out that was all audio.
1583000	1585000	And it came with seeds.
1585000	1588000	And it was supposed to help your plant grow.
1588000	1589000	Okay.
1589000	1591000	So, correct me if I'm wrong.
1591000	1592000	Always.
1592000	1598000	But you are saying now that I can use my PlayStation 3 to watch the grass grow.
1598000	1600000	Yes.
1600000	1604000	You don't even get the benefit of insects or animals to scamper through your garden
1604000	1606000	and eat the leaves off of your petunias.
1606000	1608000	Nice.
1608000	1610000	You can plant cherry trees.
1610000	1613000	Why don't you just go plant real trees?
1613000	1616000	Because real trees take forever to grow, Loki.
1616000	1619000	You know how long a real tree takes to grow?
1619000	1620000	Fuck long time.
1620000	1622000	That's how long it takes.
1622000	1626000	But in the world of video games, such as Animal Crossing,
1626000	1629000	I can go to Jamie's neighborhood and chop down all her trees.
1629000	1630000	You can also pull all my weeds up too.
1630000	1633000	And they'll be back in three days.
1633000	1635000	That's the beauty of video games.
1635000	1636000	I don't know.
1636000	1639000	How about spend the 1600 yen on something better?
1639000	1642000	Like tacos.
1642000	1644000	I don't know.
1644000	1647000	I'm sure you can find tacos in Japan.
1647000	1652000	But if I had 1600 yen, I would just go be buying like maybe some Anpan or something.
1652000	1653000	Anpan is delicious.
1653000	1656000	I'm having a dream game brainstorm.
1656000	1659000	What kind of video game could they make about tacos?
1659000	1660000	They don't need any.
1660000	1661000	Taco time.
1661000	1662000	We don't need any dream games.
1662000	1663000	It's like a burger time.
1663000	1664000	You get taco time.
1664000	1666000	Listen, that's a great idea.
1666000	1667000	No.
1667000	1668000	They should remake burger time.
1668000	1669000	Taco time.
1669000	1670000	No, we have too many dream games.
1670000	1671000	We need to space this out.
1671000	1673000	We can't be doing one every episode.
1673000	1674000	That's retarded.
1674000	1675000	And taco time, come on.
1675000	1676000	That's a cheap ripoff.
1676000	1677000	That's lame.
1677000	1678000	That's not original.
1678000	1679000	That's stupid.
1679000	1682000	But you also have to be graded on the artistry of your tacos.
1682000	1683000	Besides, it's a taco.
1683000	1684000	No one likes tacos.
1684000	1685000	Tacos are lame.
1685000	1686000	I like tacos.
1686000	1688000	I love chicken soft tacos.
1688000	1689000	Tacos are not lame.
1689000	1690000	You know what's lame?
1690000	1691000	You're lame.
1691000	1692000	Tacos are not lame.
1692000	1693000	You know what's lame?
1693000	1694000	Your butt.
1694000	1695000	You know what's lame?
1695000	1697000	A gardening game on any system.
1697000	1698000	No.
1698000	1701000	It's like viva piñata minus the piñatas.
1701000	1703000	Or the viva.
1703000	1706000	Or the viva, yes.
1706000	1707000	Piñata fuerte.
1707000	1711000	I had to cover that for the what the hell are they thinking.
1711000	1713000	And it's only in Japan, right?
1713000	1717000	Okay, it's a neat idea that they're putting out a game that's different.
1717000	1718000	For old people.
1718000	1722000	For old people that will buy practically anything, I guess.
1722000	1724000	But 1600 yen, it seems.
1724000	1726000	Or is it 1600 yen?
1726000	1727000	Yeah.
1727000	1728000	That seems kind of expensive.
1728000	1730000	It's like seven bucks.
1730000	1731000	That's still expensive.
1731000	1733000	I mean, why am I saying seven bucks?
1733000	1736000	It's like maybe 1650.
1736000	1739000	Yeah, it's like 15 bucks about, right?
1739000	1740000	Okay, that's lame.
1740000	1741000	That game's worth a buck.
1741000	1742000	Let's have T agrees.
1742000	1745000	Taco Time would be an amazing name for a game.
1745000	1746000	I mean, honestly.
1746000	1753000	There's, okay, we won't officially add anything to the Dream Games list yet, but be thinking about Taco Time.
1753000	1755000	There's a game in there somewhere.
1755000	1756000	More tacos, less drives.
1756000	1759000	You can do a remake of Burger Time and add other food to it.
1759000	1761000	That you create other things.
1761000	1763000	Not only burgers, but like other meals and stuff.
1763000	1765000	Nah, bored now. Bored now.
1765000	1767000	Well, that's because it was a bad idea anyway.
1767000	1769000	So there's your Taco Time. Bad idea.
1769000	1770000	I have a Dream Game.
1770000	1771000	What?
1771000	1773000	Action Bastard, the game.
1773000	1775000	No. No Dream Games tonight.
1775000	1782000	Unfortunately, one game that's not being included in the new firmware for the PS3 is Taco Time.
1782000	1785000	But some other things are going to be added in there.
1785000	1793000	And these are all, of course, rumors, but there's a lot of, I don't know, evidence to point towards it.
1793000	1801000	So the rumor is that they're adding both the in-game cross-media bar, which is something that should have been there, I don't know, from the start.
1801000	1805000	And trophies, which, you know, is Sony's way of saying,
1805000	1809000	Hey, we like achievements, but how can we get around a lawsuit?
1809000	1812000	So those will be coming very soon.
1812000	1821000	In fact, they have been spotted already in a video showing the new Bioshock for PlayStation 3.
1821000	1831000	Apparently, a member of Mac's console forums has posted some images and video during, you know, Bioshock that they've found.
1831000	1833000	So, interesting.
1833000	1840000	But either way, you know these are coming because, you know, they've announced this previously.
1840000	1841000	It's just a matter of time.
1841000	1848000	But then again, it could get delayed forever like Home has and everything else Sony-related, so.
1848000	1849000	All right.
1849000	1852000	I don't know, do you think this is a good idea? Is this something PlayStation needs?
1852000	1857000	Yeah, sure. I mean, because I know achievements have gotten me to play games I probably wouldn't normally play.
1857000	1860000	So, I mean, it's only a good thing for them.
1860000	1867000	I think, I mean, sure we'll get over it, but right now, since we haven't gotten over it yet, I still think it's a cheap ripoff.
1867000	1871000	But, you know, more power to them, I guess.
1871000	1879000	By the way, I got a private message from Cheeseburger in Chat who's suggesting that Taco Time could be like Taco Mama instead of Cookie Mama, Taco Mama.
1879000	1882000	No, it would be Cookie Mama junk food edition.
1882000	1885000	Besides, they do have a restaurant called Taco Time, so.
1885000	1889000	Let's have Tia saying, Is everyone else seriously missing the sexual euphemism?
1889000	1890000	I'm not at all.
1890000	1891000	Now maybe there's the game.
1891000	1893000	But that would be fish Taco Time.
1893000	1897000	That could be the bonus stage.
1897000	1899000	All right, forget it. Enough about tacos.
1899000	1902000	No.
1902000	1905000	That's actually an in-joke amongst me and some other people.
1905000	1906000	Forget it.
1906000	1909000	Okay.
1909000	1911000	Now they're talking about muffins. What's up with that?
1911000	1914000	Muffins are also sexual.
1914000	1915000	Muffins!
1915000	1918000	Banana muffins.
1918000	1920000	Blood muffins.
1920000	1921000	Blood muffins.
1921000	1922000	Forget it.
1922000	1925000	Have you seen the YouTube thing about it? Forget it.
1925000	1934000	Anyhow, the PlayStation 3 game End War is going to be getting some very interesting types of controls.
1934000	1941000	Gesture activated commands are coming soon to the End War game, which is a Tom Clancy game.
1941000	1944000	Here's the thing. You actually use the PlayStation Eye to do it.
1944000	1950000	And you can wave your hands, like if you wave your hand underneath the camera, then you get the game's overhead map.
1950000	1953000	And I don't know, it's kind of different here.
1953000	1958000	So it's just something that I guess incorporates the eye into the game so you can use gestures to move around.
1958000	1963000	Because waving your hands around is the next gen of gaming, in case you haven't heard.
1963000	1966000	Yeah, that's why Para Para Paradise really took off, huh?
1966000	1971000	Strangely enough, nothing about a 360 equivalent because there is that whole vision camera.
1971000	1973000	But no word yet about that.
1973000	1977000	The camera sucks and the PlayStation Eye is supposed to be a little bit more detailed.
1977000	1982000	How much different are they really, besides maybe resolution?
1982000	1987000	I don't know. I know my vision camera hasn't been used ever since I got it.
1987000	1990000	I took my picture with it and I was about as far as I went.
1990000	1993000	Oh, and I tried playing Totem Ball and then that sucked too.
1993000	1996000	But the PlayStation Eye, I guess it's a good use of it.
1996000	2002000	Although I'd rather see those other games that they had that they were showing off little tech demos for.
2002000	2007000	But hey, I mean, if you want some crappy use for a $30 camera, then sure.
2007000	2014000	Let's just make it so I can wave my hand under the camera instead of, I don't know, pushing a button.
2014000	2019000	Because what's easier? I mean, seriously, if we're going to be lazy here, pushing a button or waving your hand?
2019000	2021000	I think pushing the button.
2021000	2026000	Well now, just so you know, this is still in development and may not actually make the final cut of the game.
2026000	2028000	It's just something that's being played with right now, so we will see.
2028000	2031000	I always think it'd be like gesture control, like flipping off the enemy or something.
2031000	2041000	Well now, if they had it where you're actually, because the article referred the control to being similar to Total Recall.
2041000	2046000	Or not Total Recall, Minority Report. Why the hell? Wrong movie there.
2046000	2053000	Anyways, so if it was more like that where you're actually using your hands to move a map around and stuff like that,
2053000	2058000	that'd be kind of cool, but just to wave your hand to bring up a map is kind of stupid.
2058000	2063000	Solely907 is commenting on the previous story about the firmware.
2063000	2068000	Once firmware 2.4 comes out, the PlayStation Network becomes on par with Xbox Live.
2068000	2073000	Xbox Live is still slightly better, but not enough to justify $50 anymore. Agree or disagree?
2073000	2082000	I wouldn't agree, because I still think as far as content that's on there, there's a lot less content on the PlayStation Network.
2082000	2087000	I mean, download content's a little on par, especially with some of the games that are coming out in both systems.
2087000	2095000	But as far as original games and new PlayStation Network games, there really hasn't been that many that have come out.
2095000	2097000	It's not every week like Xbox Live Arcade.
2097000	2103000	True, although I do think maybe it's time for Xbox Live to get a little price cut, but who knows.
2103000	2105000	But they do tend to update a lot more.
2105000	2112000	I think they should too, especially since they're advertising on there, so I don't pay a monthly subscription to watch ads.
2112000	2114000	When has that ever stopped other games from doing the same thing?
2114000	2120000	Yeah. Now they're talking about motion-based games in chat. They're talking about Power Power Paradise and all this stuff.
2120000	2127000	CrunkyBoyJunior says they should have a spinoff of the Wii Fit hula hoop game where you put cymbals in your ass.
2127000	2130000	I'm not really sure how that works, but okay.
2130000	2137000	Speaking of Wii Fit and the hula hoop game, I doubt you've seen this dark soccer, but Loki, did you see the YouTube this week?
2137000	2143000	It was posted on Dig. It was some guy taping his girlfriend playing the Wii Fit hula hoop game.
2143000	2149000	But here's the thing. She was a nice looking gal, and she had a nice little booty on her, right?
2149000	2154000	She was wearing nothing but panties. Well, she was wearing panties and a t-shirt.
2154000	2160000	And the thing is that while she's playing the hula hoop game, the boyfriend zooms in on her butt.
2160000	2165000	And put it on the internet for everybody to see, and now it's everywhere.
2165000	2171000	And at the very end of the video, the guy puts the camera on himself, and he gives one of those, like, yeah type of looks.
2171000	2173000	If you haven't seen it, it's hilarious. It'd be so dumped.
2173000	2177000	I'm gonna find it. Yeah, that's happening for real. I can't believe you guys haven't seen it.
2177000	2180000	I'm gonna find it. No. I will play it in the studio after the next one.
2180000	2186000	I don't really look at Dig anymore because, well, especially their gaming topics, I've already seen most of that stuff by the time.
2186000	2191000	There's a lot of crap on there, but there's some decent stories that sometimes slip under the radar, like this one.
2191000	2194000	So I'll find it on YouTube for you guys while we cover the next story.
2194000	2197000	How is that decent? That sounds indecent.
2197000	2204000	Well, I have something more decent. It has to do with the PAL PSN update of Stuff-ness.
2204000	2207000	They got something good. Like, one good thing.
2207000	2217000	They got Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix for matchingservice.com with more suffixes to the end of it.
2217000	2220000	It's so cute. I love that game.
2220000	2224000	Ooh, that's awesome. Only a few months late.
2224000	2231000	Hey, it's £6.99 over there, so everyone download it.
2231000	2238000	They also have Rayman on the PS3 and PC store for PSP for £3.49.
2238000	2243000	Also, Medieval Resurrection for PSP out for £14.99.
2243000	2249000	And Go Sudoku Packs at £1.99. Or you can download the whole thing for £4.99.
2249000	2252000	And the Army of Two Veteran Map Pack.
2252000	2258000	There's also Prince of Persia wallpaper. Like, you care, but hey.
2258000	2260000	So that's all.
2260000	2265000	So I guess there are quite a few things coming to PlayStation Network. After all, who knew?
2265000	2269000	Yeah, well, late at least. I don't know.
2269000	2271000	Better eventually than not at all.
2271000	2275000	Okay, as I promised, I'm going to show the video here, and I apologize.
2275000	2281000	I can't make it full screen because YouTube's running really slow because we're trying to broadcast a show.
2281000	2286000	I posted the link in chat, and if you guys at home want to see this video, search for a user on YouTube.
2286000	2292000	His name is Tinsley Advertising. T-I-N-S-L-E-Y Advertising. All one word there.
2292000	2297000	Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit.
2297000	2303000	So here's the girl. She's starting to play Wii Fit.
2303000	2305000	And look at that.
2305000	2311000	I mean, and she's kind of like, you can tell she's kind of one of those cute nerdy girls, too. She's wearing glasses.
2311000	2313000	Got a little ponytail, right?
2313000	2317000	And then she has this little booty on her.
2317000	2323000	And she's playing Wii Fit. What do you think, Loki?
2323000	2329000	Yeah. Loki gave thumbs up. Sorry we don't have Justice TV tonight, so you can see how Loki gave the thumbs up there.
2329000	2334000	Dark Sakura, offensive or funny?
2334000	2336000	I'm apathetic towards it.
2336000	2340000	It was her idea. I'm sure it was.
2340000	2343000	Oh, I didn't know you were filming me.
2343000	2347000	I'm going to the end of the video just because you have to see this guy when he looks at the camera.
2347000	2351000	He's like, yeah.
2351000	2356000	Well, yeah, you put the link in the chat room, so.
2356000	2359000	There you have it. Just look.
2359000	2364000	See, now we're going to get a whole bunch of the chat room going.
2364000	2366000	You know, I'm not even going to look at the chat room.
2366000	2370000	Okay, Act Deaf is questioning my sexuality because, you know, I'm the gay one on the show, but I like girls.
2370000	2377000	But I have an appreciation for the female form. I can see the, you know, I can see why people like this video.
2377000	2380000	She's taking it as a compliment.
2380000	2391000	Anyways, so when, you know, while Europe may be enjoying Puzzle Fighter on PlayStation Network, one game they will not be enjoying is Africa, or Africa.
2391000	2399000	Apparently, Sony has taken it upon themselves to say, fuck you Europe, and they're not releasing the game out there.
2399000	2402000	Although, I don't know if that's really a bad thing because the game doesn't look that good.
2402000	2404000	Especially if I can't run over the wildlife.
2404000	2407000	Are they releasing it in Africa?
2407000	2414000	I would assume so, since that's, you know, not Europe. So, well, maybe.
2414000	2418000	That would be really bad if Africa was excluded from their own game.
2418000	2422000	I want to be able to run over the animals. That is the only way I will buy this game.
2422000	2427000	They just need to do a new Jambo Safari.
2427000	2433000	But, hey, if you ever wanted to go to a virtual safari, then Africa is the game for you.
2433000	2437000	It's supposed to be coming out in August.
2437000	2440000	Do we know what Africa is yet? Anything about it.
2440000	2442000	Isn't that a Taking Pictures game?
2442000	2443000	I think so.
2443000	2447000	Pokemon Snap, but not with Pokemon?
2447000	2448000	I don't know.
2448000	2451000	I don't know. Let's look at the other games that have come out that have been very similar.
2451000	2455000	Endless Ocean. No one bought that.
2455000	2461000	Wild Earth African Safari. No one bought that.
2461000	2465000	Pokemon Snap. Long time ago, people bought it because it's Pokemon.
2465000	2467000	And it's fun!
2467000	2468000	Gotta catch them all.
2468000	2472000	But that Cardcaptor Sakura game, that sucked ass. And I should know because I have it.
2472000	2474000	But it came with a spoon.
2474000	2477000	I remember. I think you talked about that a long time ago.
2477000	2483000	It came with a spoon and a fork, a pillowcase and a clock. And a plate.
2483000	2490000	There was also a Sakura Taisen game that came out that had a bunch of weird, bizarre shit in it.
2490000	2497000	The good thing is though, if you are in Europe and you really, really, really want to play Africa.
2497000	2498000	Region free, right?
2498000	2500000	Exactly. So just import the US one.
2500000	2501000	Africa.
2501000	2503000	If you have an HDTV.
2503000	2504000	There you have it.
2504000	2508000	Alright. Let's see.
2508000	2511000	Moving on. Talking about Bioshock.
2511000	2515000	Bioshock's making its way to the PlayStation 3 if you weren't listening to last week's show.
2515000	2520000	Apparently it's actually coming out a little sooner than maybe some folks expected.
2520000	2524000	It's coming out in October is when the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock is coming out.
2524000	2530000	And apparently it's going to have all the upgrades that the Xbox 360 version got and patches and things like that.
2530000	2536000	Also, there are new features and content that will make this a must-have game for its new audience.
2536000	2539000	As well as for those who enjoyed it on other platforms.
2539000	2543000	I don't know if that means additional levels or weapons or other types of things.
2543000	2547000	God, I hope it's not multiplayer finally or something, you know?
2547000	2550000	Can you imagine if PlayStation 3 had the Deathmatch exclusive?
2550000	2552000	No. They won't do that.
2552000	2555000	Yeah, I don't think the game's mechanics were built for that.
2555000	2561000	If anything, if they were talking about new content in there, I bet you it's the download content that was already available on the Xbox and PC.
2561000	2565000	And maybe like a bonus level or something, right?
2565000	2568000	I don't even think they're going to do that. Maybe another difficulty or something like that.
2568000	2574000	What would make me want to re-buy it if I already had it on the other systems unless there was some really good extras?
2574000	2577000	Because it's not like we're talking about a cheap game here.
2577000	2580000	Maybe the game will be cheap. Maybe that'll be the kicker. I don't know.
2580000	2585000	What they could do, they could do some of the other cheap stuff that some other first-person shooters have done.
2585000	2592000	Like a survival mode where they just keep sending enemies at you and see how long you can survive.
2592000	2597000	I don't know. More plasmids, I guess, they could add to it.
2597000	2603000	WhatupG in chat is asking, when is Bioshock 2 due out? Do we know anything about Bioshock 2?
2603000	2606000	No. I think 09, holiday.
2606000	2611000	Huh. Alright. Well, we'll see what happens.
2611000	2616000	I'm still shaking my head over this next story.
2616000	2617000	Why?
2617000	2621000	Because people are so gullible.
2621000	2628000	I don't know if anyone has seen the Fallout 3 screenshots that were out that shows basically Washington
2628000	2633000	turned into a big, you know, soot-covered smoking crater.
2633000	2647000	But an intelligence contractor called SITE, S-I-T-E, Intel Group, thought that they were al-Qaeda images, you know, propaganda.
2647000	2656000	And a few, I guess, anti-US sites posted them up, you know, and had chat logs and everything about it,
2656000	2660000	saying that this was their big dream to see or whatever.
2660000	2663000	But it was, there were screens for Fallout 3.
2663000	2667000	So there hasn't been, they haven't heard any word back officially.
2667000	2676000	But one thing that I did think was funny in this article on Kotaku is that SITE is based in Bethesda.
2676000	2682000	Well, I mean, it's actually terrorists are using those images from Fallout 3 or supposed terrorists.
2682000	2688000	Well, I think they're just affiliated sites. I don't think they're actually, I think they're just like terrorist fanboys or something.
2688000	2690000	Terrorist fanboys?
2690000	2695000	Oh, you know, any political faction is gonna have their little followers, so.
2695000	2702000	And just to kind of go back a few, well, it's not even really a story, but that YouTube that you were talking about there,
2702000	2708000	apparently there was some comments on the dig for it, and Tinsley Advertising actually replied back,
2708000	2713000	says, sorry guys, I got on Dig Front Page and, well, my girlfriend found out and she's a tiny bit upset.
2713000	2721000	I thought it was cute and it actually, or it was done with good intentions if she ever doubted how hot she is.
2721000	2724000	Over one million views on that YouTube, though.
2724000	2728000	I mean, she's an internet star, at least her butt is.
2728000	2733000	I mean, she's never seen her face. Can you imagine walking by her on the street?
2733000	2736000	Where do I know you from? Where do I know you from?
2736000	2742000	And then as she's leaving, I remember.
2742000	2744000	Forget it. All right.
2744000	2750000	That's kind of, you know, if Dan did that, I'd have to smack him.
2750000	2758000	May Satsuma in chat says, I would buy Bioshock again if it came with the living Big Daddy, then just the statue. It's pretty awesome.
2758000	2764000	About the Fallout things, though, I saw that picture of the whole like Washington, D.C. looking destroyed thing.
2764000	2768000	And it is pretty scary how realistic some of these games are getting.
2768000	2772000	But then again, I mean, remember Independence Day?
2772000	2775000	Yeah. Remember when the trailers for that movie came out?
2775000	2779000	This is a long ass time ago, right? Who doesn't remember the movie Independence Day?
2779000	2783000	I guess if you were really young, you might not, because that movie came out when I was in junior high.
2783000	2786000	No way. I saw that when I was in college.
2786000	2787000	Really?
2787000	2788000	Yes.
2788000	2790000	Is it that? I thought it was like early 90s.
2790000	2796000	No, no, no, no. I was in college because I remember going to see that with my friends who lived on campus.
2796000	2798000	OK, so maybe I was like a junior or senior in high school.
2798000	2800000	Because they paid for me. Because that was the only way I'd see it.
2800000	2805000	I remember that movie where they installed Mac OS on the alien mothership and destroyed all the aliens.
2805000	2806000	Yeah, yeah.
2806000	2807000	It was like 90.
2807000	2808000	Apple blew up the aliens.
2808000	2810000	Yeah, it was right before I moved out here.
2810000	2813000	Here's the thing. I don't want to argue about the year.
2813000	2821000	What I want to talk about is, remember in the trailer for the movie, one of the things they would show is that big alien ship blowing up the White House?
2821000	2827000	The first time I saw that trailer, everybody in the audience cheered.
2827000	2829000	Which I thought was funny.
2829000	2832000	OK, the chatroom agrees it was 1995.
2832000	2838000	So, I mean, it's not like we haven't seen these horrific images, quote unquote, before.
2838000	2842000	But, you know, at least when you're watching a movie trailer, you know you're watching a movie trailer.
2842000	2849000	But when you see these random images on the internet of Washington D.C. looking all destroyed, it's kind of scary if you don't know what it is.
2849000	2851000	You know what I mean?
2851000	2853000	I guess.
2853000	2858000	Well, this game may not be as cool as Fallout 3, but definitely one that I'm looking forward to.
2858000	2861000	Splatterhouse, the brand new remake.
2861000	2864000	They've got some interesting features that they've been talking about.
2864000	2869000	One of which is the fact that your limbs can basically be taken off.
2869000	2873000	But after a short bit, they will actually regrow back.
2873000	2875000	So that's kind of cool.
2875000	2877000	And very detailed.
2877000	2884000	I guess instead of like a health system, your skin will start coming off, then your flesh and then your bones will break.
2884000	2887000	And all that stuff will kind of just grow right back.
2887000	2888000	Sounds lovely.
2888000	2899000	Yes. And then apparently the Killzone scriptwriter, Gordon Rennie, and I guess he did Judge Dredd and the Necronauts comics.
2899000	2903000	He's signed on to do the story for this game as well.
2903000	2906000	So that's pretty cool.
2906000	2911000	And the graphics on it so far look pretty good and very bloody.
2911000	2913000	Much like the original.
2913000	2915000	Yay, violence!
2915000	2916000	I like violence.
2916000	2918000	Violence is fantastic.
2918000	2919000	And sell stuff.
2919000	2923000	I hope the new Splatterhouse is kind of awesome because the old one kind of got boring fast.
2923000	2927000	I mean it was cool in theory, but it kind of got boring fast.
2927000	2929000	So, we'll see.
2929000	2933000	Geekboy2424 is being a little bit creepy in chat.
2933000	2934000	He's said this several times now.
2934000	2936000	He says he has an idea for the anniversary show.
2936000	2939000	The Dark Sakura should get in panties and do the hula hoop game.
2939000	2940000	No.
2940000	2943000	Here, I'll tell you what. We'll make a compromise.
2943000	2946000	I will get in panties and play the hula hoop game. How's that sound?
2946000	2948000	No.
2948000	2952000	Just kidding. I'm not actually going to do that.
2952000	2955000	Little creepy. Little creepy.
2955000	2956000	Alright.
2956000	2957000	Moving on.
2957000	2959000	Talking about Metal Gear Solid 4.
2959000	2965000	We kind of referenced this earlier because Konami is telling some people to put a lid on it.
2965000	2969000	Minor, minor spoilers here from Metal Gear Solid 4.
2969000	2974000	So, if you don't want to know, skip ahead in the podcast by about a minute, but these are just minor spoilers.
2974000	2975000	Don't worry.
2975000	2976000	Here's the thing.
2976000	2985000	Rosemary from Metal Gear Solid 2 is supposed to make an appearance, as well as Mei Ling from Metal Gear Solid the original.
2985000	2988000	They are going to be some characters in Metal Gear Solid 4.
2988000	2996000	So, if you are looking forward to being reunited with some of your favorite females from Metal Gear history, there you go.
2996000	3001000	And maybe you can convince Mei Ling to get in her panties and play Wii Fit. I don't know.
3001000	3002000	No.
3002000	3004000	You'll have to write a letter to Konami.
3004000	3008000	You used to be able to piss her off in the first game anyway.
3008000	3014000	Anyway, speaking of Metal Gear Solid 4, the soundtrack actually has been released in Japan.
3014000	3019000	Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake Gets Old. I'm sorry, Guns of the Patriots.
3019000	3027000	It's by Nobuko Toda and Harry Gregson Williams, who did the stuff before.
3027000	3035000	You can actually get it from Playasia for $28, but there are spoilers on the track listing.
3035000	3038000	So, if you don't want spoilers, then don't get it.
3038000	3045000	However, if you do get the limited edition of the game, you will get a copy of the soundtrack too.
3045000	3046000	So, who?
3046000	3054000	By the way, for Bomani fans, fans of Konami's music game series, I did notice one familiar name showed up on the soundtrack.
3054000	3058000	Sota Fujimori, apparently contributed to a couple tracks too.
3058000	3061000	And he did some of the remixes in BeatMania 2DX.
3061000	3064000	So, a little Konami connection there. There you have it.
3064000	3066000	Konami connection.
3066000	3067000	I know.
3067000	3069000	Just one big happy family.
3069000	3075000	They kind of do that though with a lot of their soundtracks, especially Contra and stuff has a lot of the Konami artists on there.
3075000	3079000	You always see Akira and Sota.
3079000	3087000	Anyways, one thing you will find this week is it's starting to get a little bit more packed with game releases again.
3087000	3089000	So, that's kind of good.
3089000	3091000	This week, we've got a bunch of stuff coming out.
3091000	3096000	First off, we've got Robert Lindgren's The Bourne Conspiracy.
3096000	3100000	It's coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
3100000	3107000	Also, this week, we've got the Incredible Hulk game, which is coming out on practically everything.
3107000	3109000	HULK SMASH!
3109000	3111000	It's the only reason I'd buy this game.
3111000	3115000	It's supposed to not suck that bad, but we'll have to see.
3115000	3122000	And then there's, of course, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360, which looks pretty awesome.
3122000	3128000	And also coming out on practically everything, Lego Indiana Jones.
3128000	3130000	So that looks pretty cool.
3130000	3135000	And Kung Fu Panda, yet another movie tie-in.
3135000	3138000	The trailer for that looks kind of funny, actually.
3138000	3141000	I don't know. I do and I don't want a game called Kung Fu Panda.
3141000	3146000	Because on one hand, it sounds really awesome, and on one hand, it sounds like a lot could go wrong.
3146000	3148000	Yeah.
3148000	3149000	It's based on a movie, right?
3149000	3150000	Yes.
3150000	3151000	That's what I thought.
3151000	3156000	Then on the Wii, there's Cabela's Trophy Bucks, which looks like crap.
3156000	3160000	On the PSP, Hot Shots Golf Open T2.
3160000	3166000	On the DS, Summon Knight Twin Age, which looks like a pretty cool Atlus RPG.
3166000	3175000	Let's see here. We've also got the, supposedly, the God of War PSP bundle is going to be coming out this week as well.
3175000	3181000	And Grid on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3181000	3183000	Aw, too bad it's not THE Grid.
3183000	3186000	Remember that game at Golf Land?
3186000	3187000	Uh...
3187000	3188000	Forget it.
3188000	3192000	Okay, well this game looks aw- this game's probably a lot better than THE Grid, so...
3192000	3196000	But I am surprised we haven't seen that come to, like, home consoles.
3196000	3199000	Me too. Maybe they should make that for Xbox Live or something.
3199000	3208000	And, uh, let's see here. And then finally, um, next Sunday, the Metallic Rose DS Lite will be coming out.
3208000	3210000	More colors, yay!
3210000	3213000	It's metallic pink-ish, you know.
3213000	3215000	It's light-ish red!
3215000	3216000	Yay!
3216000	3221000	Replacing the, um, normal pink, so...
3221000	3225000	So now everyone's gonna go scramble over themselves to get that?
3225000	3227000	Apparently, yes.
3227000	3228000	Can't wait.
3228000	3229000	Special.
3229000	3233000	Alright, let's talk about what's coming out in Japan overseas.
3233000	3242000	Coming out on June 5th for the Xbox 360, FIFA Street 3, as well as Ninja Gaiden 2, finally makes its way out in Japan on the Xbox 360.
3242000	3249000	Going over to the PlayStation 3, Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit makes its way, as well as another port of FIFA Street 3.
3249000	3259000	And if we head on over to the Nintendo Wii, Fushugi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 3, Karakuri Yashiki no Nimuri Hime.
3259000	3263000	I have no idea what that game is, but it's being made by Sega.
3263000	3268000	And, let's see, it is an RPG, that's about all I know, I'm trying to see if we have any screenshots of this game.
3268000	3271000	And sadly we do not, we just have box art.
3271000	3275000	Where the guy, dude, the guy looks like he has a little ferret as a companion.
3275000	3276000	Ferrets are great!
3276000	3279000	This might be a winner already, look at the box art, you can see it.
3279000	3280000	I can't see!
3280000	3281000	It's Shiren the Wanderer.
3281000	3285000	It's a series that's ran since Saturn, I wanna say.
3285000	3288000	And they just had one that came out on the DS in the US.
3288000	3291000	Well, it's Shiren the Wanderer 3 then.
3291000	3293000	But dude, he's got like a little ferret companion on his shoulder.
3293000	3294000	It's a dungeon crawler.
3294000	3296000	So did Beastmaster, he had two ferrets.
3299000	3301000	And of course we endorse any game with ferrets in it, so.
3301000	3302000	That we do.
3302000	3303000	Absolutely.
3303000	3304000	Rob Ferret!
3304000	3305000	I, um, I'm trying.
3305000	3306000	It's right in front of you.
3306000	3308000	I don't know where the ferret is.
3308000	3309000	Hide it.
3310000	3311000	Give.
3311000	3312000	Woohoo!
3312000	3318000	Alright, um, let's see, moving on to other Japanese releases, that was it for the Nintendo Wii.
3318000	3322000	On the Playstation 2, Ukuki is coming out.
3322000	3323000	What?
3323000	3324000	Ukuki.
3324000	3325000	Okay.
3325000	3326000	That's what I say all the time.
3326000	3327000	Ukuki.
3327000	3328000	I don't think it's that.
3328000	3334000	This is an adventure game from, who's making this, Global A Entertainment.
3334000	3337000	And no screenshots or nothing, I couldn't tell you exactly what this game is.
3337000	3339000	But the box art is very artistic.
3339000	3341000	Looks kinda hand drawn almost.
3341000	3342000	Uh, Ukuki.
3342000	3349000	Uh, Yamasad, Digi World, Collaboration SP, Pochi Slot Ridge Racer.
3349000	3350000	Ugh.
3350000	3352000	You can just imagine what that is.
3352000	3353000	I'll just leave it at that.
3353000	3354000	No.
3354000	3355000	I'm sure it is that.
3355000	3356000	No.
3356000	3357000	Pachinko for Ridge Racer.
3357000	3358000	I know.
3358000	3359000	It's a Pachinko slot machine.
3359000	3365000	On the Nintendo DS, Deep Aquarium.
3365000	3366000	What is Deep Aquarium?
3366000	3367000	It's exactly what it sounds like.
3367000	3368000	It's an aquarium.
3368000	3369000	I'll be damned.
3369000	3370000	It really is.
3370000	3371000	It is.
3371000	3372000	No, it looks like the bottom of these.
3372000	3375000	It looks like Titanic imagery there from the cover.
3375000	3377000	Deep Titanic Aquarium.
3377000	3378000	It's definitely.
3378000	3380000	Yes, you too can take care of your frozen corpses.
3380000	3384000	At first I thought it was in San Aquarium, but I was sadly mistaken.
3384000	3387000	And nothing this week on the Sony PSP.
3387000	3389000	Sorry PSP fans in Japan.
3389000	3391000	That's it for release dates overseas in Japan.
3391000	3395000	Well, back to a different side of overseas.
3395000	3398000	We have our UK release dates and there's not a whole bunch of stuff.
3398000	3400000	But hey, it's stuff still.
3400000	3404000	One that Rob would probably be interested in.
3404000	3405000	I just have to say really quick.
3405000	3409000	Hitstun has played that series of games and it is a ferret.
3409000	3410000	In the game.
3410000	3411000	Do want.
3411000	3412000	Okay.
3412000	3413000	Thank you chatters.
3413000	3416000	On DS comes Etrian Odyssey.
3416000	3419000	Everybody's Golf 2 for PSP.
3419000	3422000	Lego Indiana Jones for a whole crap ton of everything else.
3422000	3425000	Mass Effect on PC.
3425000	3432000	Ninja Gaiden 2, Xbox 360, and for Rob, Civilization Revolution.
3432000	3433000	Hooray!
3433000	3435000	Except I heard it got pushed back here in America.
3435000	3437000	So I'm wondering at like the very last minute.
3437000	3439000	So I'm wondering if the same thing didn't happen.
3439000	3440000	It only got pushed back a week.
3440000	3441000	Or over in Europe.
3441000	3443000	It's the second week in July.
3443000	3444000	No, that's more than a week.
3444000	3446000	It was supposed to be out the first week in June.
3446000	3447000	Supposed to be the first week in...
3447000	3448000	Oh yeah, average.
3448000	3451000	It'll be out the first week of June in...
3451000	3453000	I knew about that a long time ago.
3453000	3455000	It just got delayed like a couple days ago.
3455000	3456000	No it didn't.
3456000	3457000	It's been that date for a long time.
3457000	3458000	Well that's when I heard about it.
3458000	3460000	Well people just didn't know about it.
3460000	3461000	Well...
3461000	3462000	But there's also a bunch of good stuff though coming out this month.
3462000	3464000	If Europe gets that too, I'm gonna cry.
3464000	3465000	Because I love Civilization.
3465000	3467000	I'm actually probably gonna get this game.
3467000	3470000	Because it seems like it really simplified what was becoming a very...
3470000	3472000	Oh god, I sound so like dumb and baby.
3472000	3473000	Question though.
3473000	3475000	Are you gonna get it for the 360 or DS?
3475000	3476000	360.
3476000	3477000	Achievements.
3477000	3478000	Why?
3478000	3479000	Achievements.
3479000	3480000	Yeah.
3480000	3481000	That's what I said.
3481000	3482000	Why not?
3482000	3485000	I'm assuming there's something for Xbox Live.
3485000	3486000	Remember CivNet?
3486000	3487000	That game was the sh...
3487000	3488000	I love CivNet.
3488000	3491000	If I could find a copy of CivNet that still worked, I'd actually probably play it.
3491000	3493000	It's awesome.
3493000	3494000	Cool.
3494000	3495000	There you go.
3495000	3500000	Akuma, JP, and Chat by the way just linked the official website for that game.
3500000	3504000	Because he actually lives in Japan so he knows a little bit about some of the releases going
3504000	3505000	on over there.
3505000	3506000	Is he gonna get the gardening game?
3506000	3507000	No, nothing...
3507000	3508000	Oh, is he gonna get the gardening game?
3508000	3510000	I somehow doubt it.
3510000	3516000	You know, if you really want the gardening game, you can just do a Japanese account and
3516000	3517000	buy them.
3517000	3518000	No.
3518000	3519000	No.
3519000	3520000	Alright.
3520000	3521000	Back to news.
3521000	3526000	Anyways, if gardening's not your thing, then perhaps Red vs. Blue is your thing.
3526000	3531000	Red vs. Blue just released their brand new series, Reconstruction.
3531000	3536000	Now, it's a little bit more serious and less funny than the original.
3536000	3541000	Actually, it's not even really that funny at all, but definitely more serious now.
3541000	3547000	People aren't sure if maybe this first episode is serious as kind of like a joke that's gonna
3547000	3551000	run through the whole thing, or if this whole thing's very serious.
3551000	3552000	I don't know.
3552000	3557000	But either way, you can definitely check it out on RoosterTeeth.com.
3557000	3562000	And I'm pretty sure that stuff's also on Xbox Live, their video marketplace.
3562000	3568000	But RoosterTeeth.com for Red vs. Blue, Reconstruction.
3568000	3571000	Which, of course, is set in Halo 3.
3571000	3572000	Very nice.
3572000	3575000	Well, one of these days, there ought to be a Halo movie.
3575000	3579000	I know that's been all going back and forth, and video game movies seem to be all the rage
3579000	3580000	right now.
3580000	3584000	And now throwing their hat into the ring, Brett Ratner.
3584000	3587000	He's a pretty famous Hollywood director.
3587000	3589000	He did the Rush Hour trilogy.
3589000	3594000	He did the third part in the X-Men series, so take that however you want.
3594000	3599000	So do we stab him with our plastic knives yet?
3599000	3601000	Depending on if you liked or disliked that film.
3601000	3607000	He was also on that short-lived reality show about Hollywood that was on Fox last year.
3607000	3608000	On the Lot.
3608000	3609000	That's what it was called.
3609000	3610000	He was one of the judges on On the Lot.
3610000	3611000	That's the first time I've ever heard of that.
3611000	3612000	It's fucking sad that I know that.
3612000	3614000	That show was poorly rated, too.
3614000	3617000	I remember watching the first episode and saying, this is lame.
3617000	3619000	I watched the first episode, too, and went, this is lame.
3619000	3625000	Anyhow, here's the thing is that apparently he is saying that he's going to be getting
3625000	3626000	into gaming.
3626000	3631000	He says he'll, quote, be doing movies that come from video games.
3631000	3636000	He also is mentioning that he has ties to the Activision catalogs.
3636000	3638000	So possibly Call of Duty.
3638000	3639000	That'd be lame.
3639000	3640000	Soldier of Fortune.
3640000	3641000	Who knows?
3641000	3642000	I can't see it.
3642000	3643000	Guitar Hero, the movie.
3643000	3646000	I can see them doing something original, but Call of Duty.
3646000	3648000	I mean, there's no characters in it.
3648000	3651000	It's just a war game.
3651000	3652000	I don't know.
3652000	3653000	It would be hard for them to do that.
3653000	3655000	It'd be just like doing a war movie.
3655000	3657000	Assassin's Creed, perhaps?
3657000	3658000	Perhaps.
3658000	3661000	It might be a little while before this movie comes out, but something to consider.
3661000	3662000	Some other news that was around the internet this week.
3662000	3667000	Tigerclaw in our chat is sharing, Brett Ratner is also going to direct Beverly Hills Cop
3667000	3668000	4 with Eddie Murphy.
3668000	3671000	It was apparently announced this week.
3671000	3675000	I also heard a rumor that he may be doing the God of War movie.
3675000	3678000	I also heard a rumor that he sucks.
3678000	3679000	Rumor?
3679000	3683000	Well, that may be a fact.
3683000	3687000	Geekboy2424 says, like the Zelda movie, please make it happen.
3687000	3688000	Please, please, please.
3688000	3689000	In true fanboy fashion.
3689000	3691000	Wasn't that IGN thing good enough?
3691000	3694000	I think that that was all that there needs to be.
3694000	3697000	Yes, the IGN thing is all you're ever going to get, probably.
3697000	3698000	When has Nintendo ever...
3698000	3699000	Oh, wait.
3699000	3701000	I take that back before it comes...
3701000	3704000	Because I remember I was going to say, when has Nintendo ever let any of their properties
3704000	3705000	become movies?
3705000	3709000	And that's because for quite a while, I had the Super Mario Brothers movie erased from
3709000	3710000	my memory.
3710000	3712000	I was just thinking that, actually.
3712000	3714000	And I just brought it back for all the rest of you.
3714000	3715000	Remember Dennis Hopper's Bowser?
3715000	3717000	No, I didn't actually see that movie.
3717000	3718000	Good times.
3718000	3719000	John Leguizamo, Luigi.
3719000	3720000	I actually have not seen that movie.
3720000	3722000	Oh, we need to have a movie night.
3722000	3723000	No.
3723000	3724000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3724000	3728000	Speaking of movies, before we get into the next story, Loki, you didn't talk about it
3728000	3733000	during your gaming week, but you have to take a sneak peek at a recent movie, right?
3733000	3734000	Yes.
3734000	3738000	I was screen number 14 for Postal.
3738000	3740000	Actually, I've been watching that.
3740000	3747000	We got legitimate screener copies at our place of employment and got to check it out.
3747000	3751000	It's actually watchable, I guess.
3751000	3753000	They're trying to be controversial.
3753000	3757000	I don't know if I'm just desensitized to a lot of this stuff or if it just really falls
3757000	3762000	flat, but there's some funny parts.
3762000	3767000	There's a part that I laughed at where he's at a job interview and they're asking him
3767000	3771000	all these really stupid questions and then the very final question they ask him is this
3771000	3778000	woman and she's like, what is the difference between a duck?
3778000	3780000	It makes no sense.
3780000	3787000	He just blows up at her and his day kind of gets worse from there.
3787000	3788000	I don't know.
3788000	3790000	There's funny parts, I guess, in it.
3790000	3797000	There's a part where Uwe Abel gets his nuts blown off and he falls down dead saying I
3797000	3798000	hate video games.
3798000	3799000	Nice.
3799000	3803000	Any time that he was on screen, he wasn't even funny.
3803000	3807000	He was trying to be funny where, oh, I finance my movies with Nazi gold.
3807000	3810000	I like children.
3810000	3812000	It just wasn't very funny.
3812000	3818000	Other parts, there's a part where they use a cat as a silencer and that was kind of funny
3818000	3820000	because it's just ridiculous.
3820000	3823000	There's a lot of ridiculous stuff in it.
3823000	3827000	Well, Postal's a pretty ridiculous game, too.
3827000	3834000	There's a gunfight where it seems like the only people getting killed brutally is children.
3834000	3836000	That's kind of sick.
3836000	3841000	And then there's a part in the beginning where they're arguing about how many virgins they're
3841000	3847000	going to get when they blow up a plane and stuff because 9-11, how funny.
3847000	3848000	I don't know.
3848000	3852000	The thing is, like some other movies I've seen that have tried to be controversial,
3852000	3854000	it doesn't really work.
3854000	3860000	I mean, it sort of is, I guess, but it's not like, oh my god, this is horrible, blah blah
3860000	3861000	blah.
3861000	3864000	It's just kind of, it's such a ridiculous setting, you just kind of get desensitized
3864000	3866000	to the whole thing.
3866000	3872000	But I will say, having seen other Uwe Abel movies, it's watchable.
3872000	3876000	It's a bad movie, but you can watch it and be entertained by it, I guess.
3876000	3881000	Is it one of those movies that I'm going to be seeing at Midnight Mass several years from
3881000	3885000	now, or the trash film orgy here in SAC?
3885000	3887000	I don't know if I'd give it that much credit.
3887000	3893000	I would say that it's like Cheerleader Ninjas, but not quite as funny.
3893000	3894000	So probably not Midnight Mass.
3894000	3895000	Let me put it this way.
3895000	3898000	Midnight Mass is a thing they do in San Francisco.
3898000	3901000	It's a midnight thing they do every summer, and it's hosted by a drag queen named Peaches
3901000	3902000	Christ.
3902000	3909000	Let me put it this way, it's worth like a dollar rental or something like that.
3909000	3913000	I mean, I would maybe check it out just to say you've seen it.
3913000	3916000	Don't expect it to be very controversial or anything like that.
3916000	3921000	I mean, there's parts that they just get ridiculous with, like Full Frontal Dave Foley and stuff
3921000	3922000	like that.
3922000	3929000	But it's just, I don't know, it kind of works, but at the same time it's just really ridiculous
3929000	3931000	and very low budget, I guess.
3931000	3937000	DJ Jenai in chat says Postal equals the Razzie movie of the year.
3937000	3939000	Do you think the Razzies will even remember this movie?
3939000	3941000	I don't even think it deserves a Razzie.
3941000	3946000	I mean, as it is, it's 13 screens right now.
3946000	3947000	13 screens that it's on.
3947000	3948000	13!
3948000	3952000	Hey, that's a lot better than the 4 that was originally thought that it was supposed to
3952000	3953000	be on.
3953000	3954000	I don't know.
3954000	3958000	I kind of want to see it just so I can understand for myself how...
3958000	3961000	It's not coming out for a while, I mean, on DVD.
3961000	3965000	Not that far away, but not for a few months.
3965000	3968000	I think I'd like to view.
3968000	3971000	All right, let's keep moving with the news.
3971000	3974000	Some of our listeners want to break so they can go to the bathroom.
3974000	3977000	Yeah, some people do want that, don't they?
3977000	3978000	Yes.
3978000	3985000	At any rate, another series that has a pretty good following is the Brothers in Arms series.
3985000	3994000	There is actually a book that was put out, a novelization that covers two of the days
3994000	3999000	that weren't covered in the ten days of the operation that the game covers.
3999000	4005000	Basically, the game is selfless for when the Allies were trying to seize a bridge in the
4005000	4008000	Netherlands in 1944.
4008000	4017000	But now, there's also talks about there being a movie based off of the Hell's Highway thing,
4017000	4018000	so that might be pretty cool.
4018000	4022000	See, that could work, because Brothers in Arms actually has characters and a story that
4022000	4026000	it follows instead of just war, war, war, war, shoot, shoot, kill, kill.
4026000	4027000	Nazi dead.
4027000	4028000	Exactly.
4028000	4030000	They have material to work with.
4030000	4032000	They've got a good source.
4032000	4034000	It's one of the biggest things that bugs me about...
4034000	4037000	Yeah, but Saving Private Ryan, it's not.
4037000	4046000	One of the things that bugs me about movies made from video games is where they take material
4046000	4051000	here and they try to translate it into something that would be believable.
4051000	4054000	However, if they're going to get the fans of the game to see it, then they need to stay.
4054000	4057000	Like, Silent Hill stayed true to its roots, I thought.
4057000	4061000	And I thought, you know, how many fans of the series liked the movie?
4061000	4063000	I mean, just about everyone I talked to.
4063000	4065000	But Silent Hill did take a lot of shit as well.
4065000	4068000	I don't remember the girl whining in the Silent Hill game.
4068000	4071000	Silent Hill! Silent Hill!
4071000	4073000	I would have thrown her off the cliff myself.
4073000	4075000	I think she just said it twice.
4075000	4076000	But, no, that was a lot.
4076000	4078000	Well, it was when she had her dream.
4078000	4081000	I'd like to point out Silent Hill did have Pyramid Head ripping somebody's skin off,
4081000	4082000	so it did deliver her.
4082000	4083000	That was the greatest...
4083000	4085000	That was the fan service.
4085000	4086000	Exactly.
4086000	4090000	Like, he made the shouty bitch shut up.
4090000	4092000	And the very end of it, too, when they killed the boar queen.
4092000	4095000	They need Silent Hill 2. Pyramid Head rapes everyone.
4095000	4097000	No.
4097000	4099000	Ooh, now I need dream movies.
4099000	4101000	Oh, my God. No.
4101000	4104000	Yes, Pyramid Head gets set loose on the streets of San Diego.
4104000	4108000	But I'm saying that there's been other adaptations of, you know...
4108000	4111000	And really, I don't think it necessarily has to do with just video game adaptations,
4111000	4114000	but, like, you know, we've had comic adaptations
4114000	4119000	and we've had different types of ones where they just completely shred the, you know, original material
4119000	4122000	and try to say, oh, but we should have been this.
4122000	4124000	And I was like, no, no, no, no.
4124000	4125000	I've got it, Rob.
4125000	4128000	Silent Hill 6, The Roommate.
4128000	4130000	You can actually have where...
4130000	4132000	It could be like a comedy, like a sitcom, you know,
4132000	4135000	where some guy ends up getting this roommate because he needs an apartment
4135000	4138000	and can't find any other places to rent.
4138000	4141000	And that roommate happens to be Pyramid Head.
4141000	4143000	And, oh, hilarity ensues.
4143000	4146000	That sounds like it would be a cheesy YouTube series.
4146000	4149000	Pyramid Head. Oh, man, you're leaving skins of corpses around.
4149000	4150000	What the hell?
4150000	4154000	God, what was it? Someone linked me to a YouTube series
4154000	4160000	that had, like, a bunch of different horror movie slashers playing poker together.
4160000	4161000	Nice.
4161000	4163000	And Jason had to go home because his mother wanted him to go home.
4163000	4167000	You know, they have to dress him up for, you know, the guy's parents coming over
4167000	4169000	or something like that so they don't get all creeped out.
4169000	4171000	It's like wearing a bonnet or something.
4171000	4175000	Take WD-40 to that rusty head.
4175000	4176000	Yeah, I don't know.
4176000	4177000	Anyway, but no.
4177000	4181000	Paint a face on him like Jack.
4181000	4184000	Okay, you realize I'm going to go home and draw this now, right?
4184000	4185000	Oh, dear.
4185000	4188000	But anyway, but no, but do you get my point?
4188000	4189000	Yes.
4189000	4194000	Is that if they're taking something that there are already an established fan base for,
4194000	4198000	I understand wanting to get more people than just the fan base to see it,
4198000	4201000	but they need to stay true to their core material.
4201000	4205000	That's why I'm actually kind of, I'm feeling actually kind of good about, you know,
4205000	4208000	doing a movie for this series because you've got something established
4208000	4210000	and easy to work with, I think.
4210000	4213000	Something that there's not really too much room to fuck it up unless you let,
4213000	4215000	you know, Uwe Boll do it.
4215000	4217000	Well, we'll see what happens.
4217000	4224000	Well, I don't really know how to translate or I should say kind of move over to this story,
4224000	4227000	but hey, let's talk about something completely different, I guess.
4227000	4228000	How about something local?
4228000	4229000	Yeah, something local.
4229000	4230000	Local news.
4230000	4231000	What?
4231000	4235000	Yes, apparently someone is acknowledging Stockton, California.
4235000	4236000	Why?
4236000	4239000	I don't know because apparently they wrote an article about, you know,
4239000	4243000	Grand Theft Auto 4 and how it's making people crazy,
4243000	4249000	but apparently according to the Stockton record, they have a couple quotes here.
4249000	4253000	My son Peter was never really aggressive, but once he got into the video games,
4253000	4257000	GTA being one of them, he started to push, hit, talk back,
4257000	4259000	and just become a different person.
4259000	4263000	It said Stockton parent Greg Within.
4263000	4264000	His last name is Within.
4264000	4266000	That's kind of weird.
4266000	4269000	And it doesn't really say how old his son is.
4269000	4272000	I know people that are letting their like eight-year-old son play these games,
4272000	4275000	so like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty 4.
4275000	4276000	I don't get it.
4276000	4278000	And then anyways, there's another one.
4278000	4282000	It's all this other guy who's 19 said he was involved in an altercation a week
4282000	4284000	after he purchased Grand Theft Auto 4.
4284000	4290000	He says at the time he noticed that he had become less sensitive to violence.
4290000	4293000	Grand Theft Auto 4, tearing a neighborhood apart.
4293000	4298000	And the 19-year-old says it didn't completely blame the game for his violence,
4298000	4300000	but it did affect him.
4300000	4301000	I don't know.
4301000	4302000	It sounds retarded.
4302000	4304000	It was covered on Game Politics,
4304000	4308000	and you can also find it at recordnet.com,
4308000	4313000	which is the official Stockton newspaper's website.
4313000	4318000	And yes, Stockton is like the butthole of the Sacramento area.
4318000	4320000	It's not even Sacramento area.
4320000	4324000	It's more like that space between Sacramento and L.A.
4324000	4326000	that you drive down on the freeway.
4326000	4332000	Or worse yet, that space between Sacramento and Fresno.
4332000	4335000	And you can blame Jesse.
4335000	4337000	They do have a good arcade there, though.
4337000	4341000	Corona as the author of the original.
4341000	4345000	It's Grand Theft Auto 4, criticized by Stockonians.
4345000	4347000	Stockonians!
4347000	4348000	Wow!
4348000	4349000	Is that what they call themselves?
4349000	4351000	That's retarded.
4351000	4355000	Apologies to all of our listeners in Stockton, California.
4355000	4356000	The fact that you live there.
4356000	4358000	Do they have a good golf land?
4358000	4359000	They have a Para Para machine.
4359000	4360000	The golf land was kind of cool.
4360000	4361000	Do they still have the Para Para?
4361000	4362000	I don't know.
4362000	4364000	It's been a long time since we've been to Stockton Golf Land.
4364000	4365000	We should go to Stockton Golf Land.
4365000	4366000	Why?
4366000	4368000	You are actually suggesting we go to Stockton willingly.
4368000	4369000	To Golf Land.
4369000	4370000	We'll see.
4370000	4371000	Do they have an S Mart?
4371000	4372000	Only if we get to...
4372000	4373000	Yes, they do have an S Mart.
4373000	4376000	I have to comment on it every time we go by there.
4376000	4377000	And you know something else?
4377000	4378000	Is that they actually spell it out, Save Mart, now.
4378000	4379000	Oh, shoot.
4379000	4380000	That sucks.
4380000	4381000	And you know something that's pretty funny, though, too?
4381000	4386000	Is this story right here is basically written about the launch day of Grand Theft Auto 4.
4386000	4389000	Yet it's coming out a month afterwards.
4389000	4391000	I mean, talk about trying to fill space.
4391000	4393000	Sorry.
4393000	4394000	Let's see.
4394000	4396000	SSG100Matt in chat says,
4396000	4401000	I heard a mother say she got the game for her kid because he was being made fun of in school for not having the game.
4401000	4403000	Meanwhile, the kid was 12.
4403000	4405000	Stupid.
4405000	4406000	Wowzers.
4406000	4408000	Kids will get made fun of for anything.
4408000	4415000	The color of their hair, their name, the clothes they wear, the way they walk, talk, behave.
4415000	4416000	Just get over it.
4416000	4417000	That's school for you.
4417000	4418000	Well, guess what?
4418000	4426000	I have some more Grand Theft Auto 4 related news.
4426000	4431000	Benny Hill's coming to a no, it's actually has to do with the kind of an idiot.
4431000	4436000	And it has to do with a 13 year old boy.
4436000	4439000	And we can't give out his name because he's only 13.
4439000	4442000	But if we could, he would win this week's stupid award.
4442000	4444000	This is coming from the police.
4444000	4450000	Paul Chastani. He's a lieutenant of a Massachusetts police force.
4450000	4452000	It was a male 13 year old.
4452000	4462000	And what he did, he stayed after class when other students had left the classroom and then pulled an 11 inch knife on the teacher and asked for 20 bucks.
4462000	4468000	When the teacher refused, he lowered his demand to one dollar.
4468000	4471000	Give me a dollar.
4471000	4473000	The teacher then took the knife from the student.
4473000	4476000	It doesn't explain how that happened, but the teacher was able to get the knife away from the student.
4476000	4477000	And just like punched him.
4477000	4479000	But no, no, here's the thing.
4479000	4487000	The police said the boy wanted to buy the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but his mother had refused to give him the money.
4487000	4490000	So he came up with an alternate plan.
4490000	4494000	So first off, why was the kid trying to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas?
4494000	4497000	Dude, that game's been out for like years.
4497000	4499000	Maybe he only has a PlayStation 2.
4499000	4502000	Because apparently his mom's a bitch for not buying him any violent video games.
4502000	4507000	I guess that makes sense, because I think it's cheaper now, so only 20 bucks might cover that game.
4507000	4509000	Actually, it wouldn't.
4509000	4513000	He'd be slightly short with tax, so sucks for him.
4513000	4516000	But the moral of the story is, this guy sucks.
4516000	4520000	And his parents kind of suck for letting him get away with this.
4520000	4522000	So there you have it.
4522000	4529000	And then of course, whenever we hear these types of stories and get out stupid words, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.
4529000	4533000	And when I get angsty, people die. Oh, and the FUs of the week happen.
4545000	4547000	I mean seriously, San Andreas?
4549000	4553000	You know, I don't really think I'm angsty about anything right now.
4553000	4555000	Make something up.
4555000	4559000	FU to my digestive system.
4559000	4560000	Okay.
4560000	4564000	For killing me softly with imp song.
4564000	4566000	Thank you, Roberta Flack.
4566000	4567000	Uh, Logie?
4567000	4569000	Uh, FU to Monster Mini Golf.
4569000	4573000	It's this chain of indoor mini golf places.
4573000	4576000	They opened one up here in Rancho Cordova.
4576000	4578000	I wanna go there, does it suck?
4578000	4581000	It does suck. It's at the Nimbus Winery.
4581000	4583000	Yeah, that's where it's big eye pedigree is.
4583000	4586000	Um, so, here's my problem with it.
4586000	4589000	First off, they just put no thought into the course design whatsoever.
4589000	4592000	It just, it kinda goes around there in a giant maze.
4592000	4598000	There is, there are no barriers from one hole to the next, so you don't know where one course begins and another one ends.
4598000	4604000	And, you practically have to search the course to find the hole that you're supposed to be knocking the ball into.
4604000	4611000	So they spent little time on the course, but they have all these cool props that are like all pneumatic and stuff like that that are really cool.
4611000	4615000	But really, I mean, indoor mini golf in this area would be a fucking awesome idea.
4615000	4617000	It's just, why isn't anyone doing it right?
4617000	4627000	I mean, if I had the money to set up something like that, I would at least put a few seconds thought into the actual course instead of just throwing some shit together.
4627000	4630000	I will not be going back.
4630000	4635000	Uh, I give an FU to driving home at 2.30 in the morning and, uh, falling asleep at the wheel.
4635000	4642000	But thankfully, somebody else was there to take over. I didn't drive unsafe, but just FU to the fact that I thought I'd be able to stay up and I couldn't.
4642000	4644000	I couldn't do it.
4644000	4646000	FU to me being weak.
4646000	4647000	Alright.
4647000	4653000	One thing that we will not be giving an FU to because it's awesome is, uh, classic video games that we love and adore.
4653000	4658000	And, uh, we're about ready to wrap up part A, but we can't do it until we pay some respect to our elders.
4658000	4669000	And, uh, we do that by asking the one and only DarkSakura to dig through the archives of games every week and pick out one of her favorites to be featured as, the OLR Classic Game of the Week.
4669000	4672000	DarkSakura, what should the kids be checking out this week?
4672000	4675000	It's a little game called Ghouls and Ghosts.
4675000	4683000	Um, also called Daya Makaimura, which, um, is really, really, you know, it's Ghouls and Ghosts, how can you go wrong with that?
4683000	4687000	It's classic. Hence, Classic Game of the Week.
4687000	4688000	Anyway.
4688000	4690000	It's like, isn't it? Okay, the music is the best.
4700000	4701000	See?
4701000	4719000	Okay, anyway, you play as a knight called, uh, Arthur who has to go through a bunch of really friggin' tough stages to go rescue, um, his, uh, his woman and, uh, save, uh, souls sold by, uh, Lucifer.
4719000	4726000	And, um, I think it's funny that his bride is named Princess Prin Prin. That's really hilarious.
4726000	4744000	But anyway, um, you pick up different, um, weapons on the way, and actually this is a sequel to Makaimura, which was Ghouls and Goblins over here, um, and the change between, um, from this one to the last one is that you can fire up and, you know, jump and fire, um, um, but you also get different weapons.
4744000	4747000	Never use the sword. It sucks.
4747000	4749000	You want to get the lances.
4749000	4751000	The holy water is okay.
4751000	4761000	But, um, you've also got different enemies that show up, like, you know, a bunch of demon-y things, and a magician that every so often will either turn him into an old man or a duck.
4761000	4762000	Yeah.
4762000	4770000	Um, you also get, um, you know, your gold armor, so you get, uh, your charge attack and one extra, I guess, hit that you can take.
4770000	4775000	The really hard part about this game is that you do have a limited number of hits you can take.
4775000	4783000	Um, starting, you know, you start off with your basic armor, but if you get the gold armor, you take one hit, you go back to your basic armor.
4783000	4786000	You get one hit, you go to a man running around in his underwear.
4786000	4789000	And then one more hit, you are dust.
4789000	4793000	Um, it has come out on, um, Amiga.
4793000	4797000	You literally just collapse into skulls and bones, which is kind of funny.
4797000	4798000	Yeah.
4798000	4805000	Um, Amiga, um, Arms Shreds, uh, CPC Atari ST, Commodore 64, raw.
4805000	4806000	Nice.
4806000	4810000	Sega Saturn, which I have that copy, and I actually bought it at a Babbage's.
4810000	4820000	So, I bought it at American Retailer, I think it's hilarious, because it was only on, uh, the Capcom Generations that they brought out in Japan.
4820000	4829000	Um, it came out on Playstation Super Graphics, Master System, Genesis, Virtual Console release, and ZX Spectrum.
4829000	4835000	But, um, it's really freaking fun, and also this game, and I'm going to spoil it for everyone.
4835000	4838000	It's only been out, you know, 20 years.
4838000	4840000	Oh my god, it's been out 20 years, it was released in 1988.
4840000	4843000	Okay, as of December, it will be out 20 years.
4843000	4844000	Okay.
4844000	4846000	Um, it was released in December 1988.
4846000	4852000	Um, but, um, I had a point.
4852000	4857000	Okay, um, so to spoil the ending, um, when you get to the end of the game, you have to do it again.
4857000	4861000	It's like, oh, guess what, remember all that sweating that you did to get through this game?
4861000	4864000	Ha ha ha ha, we lied, no ending, do it again.
4864000	4868000	And so, um, you have to go through the whole thing all over.
4868000	4870000	Um, it also had-
4870000	4871000	Sadistic.
4871000	4873000	I know, really evil.
4873000	4881000	Um, it also did have, um, a sequel to it, which in my opinion was disappointing, with Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
4881000	4888000	It did have a very epic opening, and it was really freaking hard, but I don't think that it was as much fun as this one.
4888000	4896000	And then the one that drove me crazy at E3 two years ago, hunting down, and then they kicked me off of playing it, was Ultimate Ghosts of Goblins.
4896000	4898000	Um, which is a PSP release.
4898000	4902000	And it was actually really fun, and just as freaking hard as all the other of them.
4902000	4906000	So, that's your game. That is the game.
4906000	4910000	So if you can beat this game, you have a very big E-peen, if you can beat this game.
4910000	4911000	I've beaten the game.
4911000	4913000	Then your E-peen is very big, congratulations.
4913000	4915000	I've seen my husband beat it on one credit.
4915000	4917000	That's crazy.
4917000	4920000	I've seen him beat a number of games, I've seen him beat our type on one credit.
4920000	4921000	Thanks.
4921000	4928000	Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week folks, Ghouls and Ghosts, on like a million different systems, so check it out.
4928000	4932000	The system you would urge though, I'm sure, has got to be the SEGA one, right?
4932000	4941000	Well, Saturn has the arcade perfect version, however, if you're going to get it for any of the home systems, it says Virtual Console as well.
4941000	4943000	Get the Genesis version.
4943000	4945000	Honestly, for any of the...
4945000	4950000	I didn't mind the Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts, I mean, I know you're not a fan, but...
4950000	4958000	Honestly, and this is not a problem because I was always a Super Nintendo fan girl, and I actually do like Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
4958000	4962000	Don't get me wrong at all, I like the game, it's just, it was a bit of a letdown.
4962000	4963000	Not as good.
4963000	4969000	It's like, you know, it's comparing vanilla ice cream to chocolate peanut butter ice cream.
4969000	4971000	No, it's like taking like...
4971000	4973000	They're both good, but one's got peanut butter.
4973000	4977000	No, no, no, no, no, you know what it's like using the ice cream analogy, okay?
4977000	4982000	It's like getting Ben & Jerry's, and then getting Thrifty.
4982000	4984000	I love Thrifty ice cream.
4984000	4989000	I know! I love Thrifty ice cream too, but is it as good as Ben & Jerry's?
4989000	4994000	That's debatable. How about Baskin-Robbins? Baskin-Robbins is kind of frumpy. I don't know.
4994000	4996000	Baskin-Robbins has egg nog.
4996000	5001000	Here it is, here it is. Cold Stone vs. Soft Serve at McDonald's.
5001000	5003000	I wouldn't say it's that bad.
5003000	5006000	Soft Serve at McDonald's tastes like whipped cream.
5006000	5009000	Here we go with the food again. Look, we gotta take a break.
5009000	5012000	I have ice cream at home, Rob.
5012000	5015000	It's called Medieval Madness and I bought it because it's the same as a pinball machine.
5015000	5019000	I can't eat ice cream right now, but what I can have, I have had it pretty awesome.
5019000	5023000	There's a self-serve non-fat yogurt place over by William's house that's pretty awesome.
5023000	5027000	Because you get to make the yogurt yourself, and then they have toppings galore that you put on there.
5027000	5029000	There's a TCBY by my house.
5029000	5031000	Good times. Alright, look, we're gonna take a break.
5031000	5032000	Okay.
