15259	26560	The PSP gets new 4.0 firmware, the ESRB makes plans to stop early game announcements, and we celebrate six years of Orange Lounge Radio being on the air.
31636	41066	Hello everybody out there once again and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio for the 284th time in a row, if you've been a long time listener.
41847	47653	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next three hours to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
48013	51697	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51997	52677	Hi.
52978	53718	Hi.
53858	54218	How are you?
54759	55439	I'm here.
55559	56019	Yeah.
56220	57400	Nah, it's all good.
57700	58441	Yeah, it's all good?
58841	58961	Yeah.
58981	59982	It's all good at Camp Jamie.
60062	61483	I'm recovering from my milkshake.
62343	64144	Did your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?
65085	65985	It brought something.
66365	66786	All right.
69457	70137	It brought gas.
71037	74338	Say hello to, as well, Tech Master... You're so gross.
74978	77179	Say hello, as well, to Tech Master Loki.
77379	79039	How would a milkshake bring you gas?
79139	79779	I don't know.
79859	82740	It's just the first thing my toilet brain went to.
83520	83840	All right.
84200	85521	I, too, finished a milkshake.
85601	86041	Did you?
86361	91062	I went and got my... Because I went and stopped by Burger King, and I got a large milkshake and a large soda.
91182	92102	And what did it bring you?
93883	94303	Cooling.
94903	95363	Cooling?
95383	95463	Yeah.
97141	98463	I'm not so hot anymore.
98723	102469	Are you seriously freaking cold?
103070	103350	I mean...
108991	114673	Let me introduce, since Loki's already yelling at somebody, he has not been on our show in quite some time.
114913	115754	About a year.
116034	117955	Well, a year is quite some time.
118095	119415	I was just quantifying it.
119455	122256	Alright, but Miklatov is here tonight.
122456	122796	Hello.
123397	126898	And Miklatov ran away from our program to go be in Kansas for a little while, right?
127758	127999	Yeah.
128419	131540	Alright, and he walked into the studio tonight wearing a blanket.
132639	135381	Because it feels cozy after you eat a lot of food.
135441	137001	It's like, oh, I'm just going to relax.
137061	140723	I would like to point out it's over 100 degrees outside here in lovely Sacramento, California.
140804	142004	This is like a nice blanket.
142024	143545	It's not heavy, so it feels fine.
143665	146226	But I'm just saying it's like it's 100 degrees outside.
146927	147427	Hold on.
147447	150109	And we had to have the lights off before the show to keep it cool in here.
150129	151409	We have like two fans going.
151689	152730	The door opened to the house.
154271	155592	Yeah, we might return the lights off.
155612	156392	Screw Justin TV.
156432	157693	It's not a video show.
158933	161615	And I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a shirt underneath.
162921	163381	and Shorts.
163461	164242	And now a blanket.
164382	165062	And a blanket.
165322	167043	And why, just because it feels nice.
167063	174368	Because it's, yeah, if you eat a lot of food and then you're like, oh, I'm so stuffed and you don't want to move, it always feels better to just have something to kind of wrap yourself up in.
174648	177690	Like, you were the food and this is your shell.
177950	179491	Like a tostada or something.
179811	180111	Okay.
180591	182532	Tell us what you've been up to for the past year.
182572	183353	Anything exciting?
185294	186194	Hmm.
186835	186995	No.
187355	187575	Okay.
187595	189917	I almost got hit by a tornado.
189937	189977	Oh.
191986	193767	I think that's kind of cool.
194527	200368	It interrupted WoW and it wasn't very fun because I had to stop playing WoW for a minute to check on the tornado.
200568	201469	Are you still in touch?
201609	206410	You used to work at the Konami building but then they don't have their offices here in NorCal.
206970	209671	I don't know what you can or can't say about the past or the future.
209811	212772	I'm working for them as an independent contractor.
213532	214072	Very cool.
214712	215693	Can you talk about anything?
215713	216373	Probably not, huh?
217153	219234	No, it's whatever I always do.
219514	219834	Alright.
220894	222375	We're doing stuff.
222716	223036	All right.
223156	224297	Hey, those lights went off.
224617	228620	All right, let's change the topic and talk about our gaming weeks.
229621	234164	We always like to start the show off talking about what we've been playing in our weeks, and we'll start it off, ladies first.
234225	236226	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
236586	239288	I played Ragnarok and Pinball, as usual.
240489	247455	And I'm still waiting for Dan to bring me back The World Ends With You, so I have no idea what's going on.
248496	248836	That's it.
250456	250776	Alrighty.
251056	251336	Loki!
253577	265639	Um, I got an R4 this week, so I was playing some DS games, and I tried playing, um, what was it, uh, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan, but that game is boring.
266259	269300	Absolutely boring, since it's all in Japanese and I can't read any of it.
270280	272981	I'm like, seriously, when am I gonna get to the boot poking, okay?
273521	277582	But, uh, yeah, just, it's, uh, One Trick Pony, it seems like.
278962	279482	And then, uh,
280270	285594	I tried a bit of Band Brothers, which is actually pretty neat.
286155	290938	A little difficult to figure out how to play it though, but still pretty cool music game.
290978	292660	It'd be nice to see that brought over here.
293600	298244	Then also played Jump Ultra Superstars, which...
299725	302226	I guess people compare it to Smash Bros.
302246	302686	a little bit.
302766	304666	I wouldn't say it's quite like Smash Bros.
305027	314950	There's a lot of characters in it for sure, and I like how you can combine different pieces of artwork and stuff to allow you to switch characters and add abilities and stuff like that.
315350	319651	So I'd say it's more like Marvel vs. Capcom or something like that, which is pretty cool.
320874	323656	And then played a little bit of that still live game.
323936	328519	I mean, it's pretty much very similar to the Flash Portal game.
328659	331921	So if you've played that, you pretty much have played this game as well.
333082	338186	And Point Blank DS, because I was trying to find that everywhere and no one sold it.
338306	339807	And then just kind of gave up on it.
340447	346471	I mean, Point Blank DS is pretty much just like Point Blank without a gun and just using the stylus.
346531	347672	And actually, it's pretty fun.
348432	350594	So too bad that that didn't do very well.
351975	363003	And then of course on top of all that stuff I was playing Grand Theft Auto 4 Because that's fun So what does this device do, this R4 for those that don't know?
363483	374692	It allows you to run homebrew on your DS and also you can run ROMs as well for DS games Basically it uses a micro SD card and you can throw stuff on there
376448	382192	It's good for playing import stuff, especially if you're just looking to try out a game and don't actually plan on buying it.
384614	386135	What the hell is this?
388537	393000	I was waiting for the singing to start.
394861	396603	Yo-ho, yo-ho, Pirate's Life for me.
396743	397283	Bad joke.
398764	400626	You need to cue up your jokes next time.
400646	401186	Terrible, I know.
401206	403668	I wonder what would have been better.
405950	409254	I'm glad to know after six years, things still don't work right on this program.
412918	414801	I was working on some other things.
417464	419587	I posted a video on GameTrailers.
419627	425153	I mean to post it on the YouTube community we have, but I forgot how to.
426038	427699	Although it's like the easiest thing in the world.
428039	431120	It is the easiest thing in the world, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, okay?
431400	435902	So tell us a little bit, because this is kind of exciting, because Orange Lounge Radio hasn't done anything video related.
435942	437903	I mean, we don't really count Justin TV.
437943	442345	I mean, no offense to Justin TV people, but this is just a camera pointed at people doing a radio show.
442385	444586	It's really not that exciting, but you wanted it, so hey.
446127	450168	But this is the first real video thing we've done in a long time.
450248	451649	So tell us a little more about what you did.
452190	460511	I actually finally got my video set up working at home because I've been trying forever to get my damn capture card to work and be able to play something at the same time.
461113	461854	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
490471	496653	I know when he describes it, it doesn't sound that exciting, but I actually watched the video, and I'm not even that big a Grand Theft Auto person.
496713	500775	I know it's a good game and all, but I just don't get into those types of games as much as everyone else.
501175	501795	I kind of laughed.
501835	502475	It was really funny.
502635	503195	It was well done.
504776	506036	It fit the music so well.
506396	506777	It was great.
506797	507197	I tried.
507517	510978	I spent long hours trying to get it to go with the music.
511238	512499	Making video is a bitch.
512819	517961	I've done video for an online game that Shane and I are involved with and it's a pain in the ass.
517981	520182	It took me like all night to do like a two and a half minute video.
520302	526645	Yeah, it's a three minute video and I started with like four hours of video and I cut it down to three minutes.
527045	528025	I bet the wife loves it.
529246	532007	Oh yeah, she loves the fact that I'm sitting there doing all that stuff.
532067	533308	Yeah, absolutely loves it.
535819	545161	No, and then, yeah, then after I finished that, then I started working on something else, which I was hoping to have done today, but it's not, so you'll have to wait.
545461	546321	Can you give us any hints?
550542	551042	Maybe.
552002	552622	I'll say something.
553302	558103	Something that people have been asking for for a long, long time, Loki is making happen.
558803	559003	Yeah.
559423	559883	I'll say that.
560664	560924	All right.
561664	562764	So, so much for your gaming week.
562804	563184	Is that it?
563857	566038	Yeah, why is the Unabomber at our window?
566358	568759	That looks like it's Andrew, not the Unabomber.
568839	571920	I know it's Andrew.
572840	573500	I'll go next.
573861	574701	I didn't even know he was coming.
575081	576962	I'll go next to talk about my gaming week.
577302	578562	Oh my god, it's the Unabomber.
579603	580303	Hi, how are you?
582055	583016	Get him on a mic somehow.
583116	585098	Oh, we don't have the... The fourth mic's not hooked up now.
585198	585938	I didn't know you were coming.
586119	586519	That's all right.
587740	588541	Wouldn't miss it for the world.
588561	590862	Yeah, this is the kind of gems that Justin... See, Justin TV?
590902	592043	He does kind of look like the Unabomber.
592063	592304	All right.
593445	594165	What's on your mind?
594746	596187	Andrew, welcome to the show tonight.
596687	597288	Oh, not much.
598489	600090	You got to get that mic, like, right there.
600330	601131	It's now working right.
602011	602692	It's a crazy mic.
604252	607154	You're here to celebrate our sixth birthday with us, I'm sure.
607594	607954	Of course.
608234	610955	And your own anniversary is tomorrow, as in your birthday.
611196	611416	Yeah.
611716	612536	How old are you going to be tomorrow?
612736	613957	Appropriately, I'm going to be 23.
614497	615318	Wow.
615878	620140	Oh my gosh, there's that number of coincidence again that got brought up on Bobby's show earlier.
620600	620920	Wow.
621881	624262	That means you were 17 when this show started?
624602	625182	Yes, I was.
625242	625983	God, I'm old.
626923	627603	God, I am old.
627643	627903	All right.
630049	630409	My Gaming Week
650289	652170	Night of Cydonia Night of Cydonia
676761	695724	because you would think like rock band's kind of the better game and in a lot of ways it is but um since I don't really like to play drums and I'm not going to sing in my house like especially when nobody's around it's not like a party where I can use alcohol as an excuse um it's I don't know there's nothing to play but guitar and I kind of like the guitar parts and Guitar Hero better than I do rock band.
695764	704546	Rock band gets kind of boring because I don't know it's a little closer to the real thing or something I don't know but um Guitar Hero gets all crazy and I like that so um
706604	708186	Rapid Slasher in chat room.
708226	710849	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com agrees.
710969	712671	That section on Cydonia is tough.
712731	713271	It is tough.
714132	714593	There it is.
715614	719098	Cheeseburger in chat says, Hey Rob, I was 7 when the show started.
719118	720239	Because he's 13 now.
720259	721060	Oh my god.
721941	722401	I'm old.
723022	723323	Joshi...
725416	727357	I don't think he was actually listening when he was seven.
727397	729878	I think he'd just say he happened to be seven.
731499	734001	Joshi16 in chat says Guitar Hero is more fun alone.
734041	735001	Yeah, I kind of agree.
735021	737743	Guitar Hero may not be the better party game, but it's more fun to play by yourself.
738143	738963	So, go figure.
739664	748748	Also in my gaming week, I bought Space Invaders Extreme for the PSP because I had played a little bit when Loki had it over here.
748868	749809	I don't know, whatever.
750069	750669	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
777153	781216	Like, not only is it flashy with the graphics in the background, but the invaders come in little colors.
781636	784018	And you have some red ones, some green ones, and some blue ones.
784038	786700	And if you shoot four blue ones in a row, you get one type of weapon.
786740	789002	You shoot red ones in a row, you get another, and so on.
789042	792545	So that's kind of like a challenge-y element to it if you want the good weapons.
792585	796828	So it's like a cross between Space Invaders and Raven.
798135	799836	Yeah, I guess, yeah.
799896	800536	It's kind of different.
800776	808079	But the only thing that kind of disappointed me, now granted, I haven't played the game a whole lot or gotten very far, so it's probably not fair for me to say a whole lot about it right now.
808479	811060	But, I mean, I've played far enough where I've started to notice this.
811480	814402	I don't notice a lot really change from level to level.
814442	816222	I mean, yeah, the aliens get smarter.
816242	818243	You start to fight these, like, massive aliens.
818303	820824	And one of the coolest things, I think, in the game is the bosses.
820864	823045	Like, they actually have boss aliens they have to fight, which is kind of cool.
823425	824866	And, you know, then you have little miniature aliens.
825146	853655	but it's still always blue, red, green aliens and the same weapon upgrades that you had in level 1 so I was just kind of hoping maybe some of that would change and upgrade as the game goes on if it does, I haven't gotten there yet and I've gotten to the point where it's starting to feel a little stale so, you know you know, because the original Space Invaders was all white or green aliens it's been 30 fucking years since the original Space Invaders it ain't broke well, but would you spend $20 to buy the original Space Invaders
854881	855922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
878356	880137	Wow, were you trying to break it?
880458	892967	You know, okay, I take a little bit of it back because I've even found myself on GameTap going back to old Atari 2600 games that were boring years ago, like Kaboom, and I freaking played Kaboom for like an hour and a half just a couple weeks ago.
893527	895049	So I guess I could see that.
895969	898051	I was trying to break my old record, though.
898571	899952	But let's face it, we're a little weird.
904791	905751	Watch the King of Kong.
905812	907472	Watch the guy play Crystal Castles with his feet.
907952	908693	I guess that's true.
910173	912714	Then I want to ask you, do you have any interest in newer Space Invaders?
912774	914815	Or is it like, oh no, this is bastardizing a classic?
915135	915695	I would try it.
916676	918036	I mean, I'm open to anything.
918156	921298	The new Frogger made me want to throw up, but I'll give Space Invaders a try.
921458	922458	The one on Xbox Live?
922478	922518	No.
922758	923298	That Frogger 2?
923839	923939	Oh.
924099	925379	No, no, the old new Frogger.
925419	926340	The old new Frogger.
926920	927320	Oh, okay.
927340	928220	The wannabe 3D Frogger.
928240	929281	It made me want to throw up.
929301	929681	Good.
930248	933194	I downloaded Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, by the way.
933294	935939	The revamped version.
937022	938304	I don't think it was based on PlayStation 2.
938464	939366	I think it's an original game.
942779	943979	There was a frog or two, though.
944159	946220	It's so cute, you want to throw up in your mouth.
946800	949241	But the little hoppy noise gets really irritating.
949401	950361	But I only played the demo.
950381	951321	I didn't actually buy the full game.
952362	953822	Anyway, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
954102	955542	Space Invaders, which is pretty cool.
955562	958143	I mean, for $20, it's pretty hard to beat.
958243	959323	It's a good-priced game.
961204	965085	PSP games are not games you usually... I mean, unless you're playing Crisis Core or something.
965385	967165	Not something you spend hours and hours and hours doing.
967265	969066	I prefer playing the PSP while I'm...
969466	970528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
991474	993135	DOOMISSION, FIGHT PEOPLE, GO BACK TO THE HUB
1021169	1024710	Okay, I gotta go to chat room because they're talking a lot about Space Invaders here.
1025431	1030712	GS68 says, from Wikipedia, Space Invaders was a very popular video game that influenced the video game industry.
1031113	1034854	In Japan, specialty arcades opened with nothing but Space Invaders cabinets.
1034894	1037435	The game is considered one of the most successful arcade shooting games.
1039476	1042557	We all know that people went crazy about the game in Japan.
1042617	1043037	We know that.
1043817	1045658	It was much bigger over there than it was over here.
1045698	1048439	Kitsune in chat says, you see Space Invaders everywhere here.
1048959	1051984	They even have Space Invaders plushies in the arcade that you can win.
1052024	1053126	That might be kind of cute, actually.
1053146	1055790	I had Space Invader cell phone charm for a while.
1056171	1061360	Now, the original Space Invaders can be kind of boring, continues Kitsune in our chat room, but I played a newer version.
1061640	1062061	I loved it.
1063228	1066070	And yeah, I enjoyed Space Invaders Extreme.
1066110	1068511	It just got a tiny bit stale, but that's okay.
1068531	1070312	It's a good short attention span game.
1070452	1071593	Kind of like the Gradius Collection.
1071633	1073694	I don't sit there and play Gradius for hours and hours either.
1074234	1075375	Shooters in general... No comment.
1075775	1075995	Huh?
1076375	1076896	No comment.
1077216	1079477	Shooters in general to me are short attention span games.
1079517	1080418	That's just the way I play.
1080438	1081338	I realize for other people it's religion.
1081358	1083579	I would like a new Gradius game that was actually really kick-ass.
1084060	1086001	You know, because I mean, Gradius V was alright.
1086681	1087162	Thanks for watching!
1099551	1104253	There wouldn't be a ship, it'd just be him there just like kicking people over and stuff.
1104953	1105254	All right.
1105594	1108075	Put out cigarettes on like other ships or something.
1108215	1111156	Let me go over to Miklatov, who's reading a book during our show.
1111296	1112497	I guess we're that exciting.
1113377	1116338	Miklatov, do you have anything you want to say about your gaming week?
1116579	1117499	Not our gaming week, but yours.
1117952	1118833	My book is good.
1118893	1120814	I don't know what you're talking about, first of all.
1121615	1125418	Secondly, all I do is play WoW or I play DJ Max on my PSP.
1126119	1127700	You need to play DS games.
1127860	1130242	I have a DS with a bunch of games on it, including imports.
1130262	1134826	I play Owen Don 2 and Phoenix Wright games, and that's about it.
1135046	1135887	And Professor Layton.
1135967	1137408	Well, I have Owen Don 2 on here.
1137888	1138609	I have that with me.
1139562	1158386	and Band Brothers Band Brothers is a fun game tell our listeners about DJ Max and some of the things you enjoy about it we have some listeners that really love it it's way better than Beatmania because it's fun and it's not insanely stupid sometimes unlike Beatmania which is insanely stupid most of the time
1159347	1169303	and it's easy to pick up and go and the songs are better and it's Korean so it's better because of that.
1170583	1177891	So in other words, if you can't sense Miklatov's insane bias for Korean-based music and Korean things, because he likes Pump It Up a lot too.
1177911	1179152	Yeah, Pump It Up's better than DDR.
1179192	1184737	Yeah, see, if you can't sense his extreme bias for all things Korean, then take what he says with a grain of salt.
1184758	1186940	How about Taiko no Tatrajin DS?
1187560	1188421	I've not played that.
1188481	1189102	It didn't look good.
1189122	1193667	I don't like the one in the arcade, and I didn't like the one on the PlayStation, so I don't think I'll like the one on the DS.
1194762	1199807	DJ Max is cool because you can customize everything in it and it's fun.
1199867	1201068	It's got stupid videos.
1201308	1205471	Yeah, I like the one video with the Power Rangers smashing the girls' flowers.
1205672	1206672	NB Rangers are cool.
1207213	1207833	Is that what it was called?
1207914	1208454	NB Rangers?
1208674	1208854	Yeah.
1209355	1209575	Funny.
1210216	1210636	That's it.
1211156	1212277	Back to book.
1213618	1214619	I like Burning Rangers.
1215200	1216481	Andrew, how was your gaming week?
1218137	1219458	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
1242026	1244047	and getting a little Day of Defeat.
1245107	1245927	Not much else, really.
1246707	1251269	Recently got Brawl and unlocked everything within nine hours of opening the box.
1251529	1253269	Wow, that's dedication.
1255050	1259471	Still haven't got all the achievements, though, so still a lot of stuff to do.
1259731	1262112	People need to register me for Brawl, by the way.
1263932	1266073	Do you know your friend code off the top of your head?
1266613	1267293	Off the top of my head?
1267353	1267513	No.
1268034	1268534	Thank you, Nintendo.
1268554	1269234	I'm not that dedicated.
1271564	1272724	Just go to the forums.
1272824	1273245	I'm there.
1273505	1273965	Look at it.
1275045	1275725	Nice plug.
1276025	1277346	Over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1277426	1278046	Click on the forums.
1278066	1278366	Thank you.
1278906	1279966	Anything else you've been playing this week?
1280567	1281707	Oh, that's about it.
1281847	1283848	Besides Brawl and Hellgate, nothing else.
1284908	1290009	DJ Ratchet in chat says, and again, if you want to join our chatroom, chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1290109	1294251	He says, I hope there will eventually be an Elite Beat Agents 2.
1296351	1298072	As much as it pains me to say it, fat chance.
1299125	1299948	Miklatov's agreeing.
1299968	1301051	Why are you agreeing, Miklatov?
1301632	1305883	Because, like, I think four people bought it?
1307193	1308354	I bought it, you bought it.
1308954	1310155	Who else bought Elite Beat Agents?
1310276	1310636	That's it.
1311577	1314359	There's the four right there.
1315820	1323486	Obviously it was more than four people that bought it, but the sad thing is you go to Fry's, which is a big electronics store here in California, there were tons and tons of them sitting in the discount bin.
1323746	1325347	I think Nintendo just had higher hopes for the game.
1325367	1330071	It just got so discounted so quick because people saw the music list and were like, oh, it's crappy.
1330652	1334595	Well, yeah, the music normally would be crappy, but inside the game it was really good.
1335015	1337517	September with the cutscenes made you feel epic.
1337537	1340899	I can discount Elite Beat Agents on account of one song and one song only.
1341220	1342300	And that would be Canned Heat.
1358999	1361261	It was a bad cover, but the story was hilarious.
1361301	1365644	It was a bad cover of a good song with a great story, but it was offbeat.
1366664	1368966	It was not so badly offbeat.
1369166	1370327	Ooh, good job.
1370407	1371888	Good research, Katamaris Forever.
1371948	1376151	Says the actual number of copies sold, 16,000 per VG Charts.
1376451	1377251	Wow.
1377772	1379673	That's practically four.
1379933	1384676	I mean, when you consider that there's a lot of crappy games that sell way more than that, it's kind of sad.
1384837	1387839	Yeah, but 16,000, that's not much bigger than four.
1389449	1391070	It's really not in the scope of things.
1391190	1393852	It's four times four thousand.
1394372	1395613	Yeah, I was close.
1395913	1397033	I had one number right.
1400687	1404410	Plus, Elite Beat Agents can kind of make you cry, you know, because it has the sad stage.
1404430	1405571	There's always a sad stage.
1407332	1408132	Which one had the Christmas?
1408152	1410394	There was the Christmas one and there was the... You're the Inspiration.
1410414	1412195	That's the one for that game.
1412435	1414977	All the sad stages are sad, except for the Owen Don one.
1415077	1415958	That one wasn't so sad.
1416318	1417479	But DJ Ratchet's right.
1417499	1419700	You're the Inspiration had some hilarious screw-up scenes.
1419760	1420521	It really does.
1421341	1425244	Like, when you see the dad in, like, a Speedo, that cracked me up.
1425504	1434273	The only thing that was more epic than, say, September in Owen Don would be doing Ready Steady Go, saving the world from a giant meteor.
1436295	1437897	That was so epic, it was hilarious.
1438517	1440719	I like Owen Don 2's epic stage.
1440759	1441400	It was cooler.
1441540	1445664	I don't remember what happens, but I just remember I liked the song better, and it was more fun to play.
1446405	1448187	By the way, spoilers for a music game.
1450618	1450998	It's alright.
1451559	1454842	I was just realizing, is it really $16,000 or is it $160,000?
1455602	1456103	It can't be $16,000.
1456603	1457784	There's no way.
1457804	1458285	Let me look.
1458365	1458645	Hold on.
1458705	1458945	Hold on.
1459206	1459726	It has to be $160,000.
1459766	1460487	I'm going to look.
1460567	1466993	America... I'll find the answer while we get into other stuff throughout the show.
1467053	1470576	If it is $16,000, yeah, there's your reason right there why we'll never get one.
1470676	1474419	Because I'm thinking like, God, I have Judgment sold more than that game?
1475540	1476281	That's sad.
1477702	1478023	All right.
1478623	1479865	Housekeeping tonight.
1481507	1483490	Tonight is our sixth anniversary show.
1484391	1484952	Yay.
1485212	1485733	Orange Launch.
1485993	1486694	Can I get a yay?
1486714	1488276	Yay.
1488357	1488637	All right.
1488917	1493443	Orange Launch Radio started on June 23rd, 2008, and it was about as exciting as this episode.
1495347	1498128	Allgames.com relaunched this week.
1498729	1499609	They have a whole new look.
1499689	1500089	Check it out.
1500309	1501870	www.allgames.com.
1501890	1505872	That is, of course, the site where we broadcast from every Sunday night live.
1505912	1512155	If you've only ever listened to us on your iPod or other type of portable device like PSP, what have you, you're subscribing to our feed.
1512655	1513616	Check us out live sometimes.
1513656	1523421	Sunday nights we tape at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, just like I want to say Dreadlock Lord in chat is joining us for the first time, I think was saying before the show.
1523481	1523901	So welcome.
1524818	1525700	Be cool like him.
1525760	1526582	Come listen to a new show.
1529339	1555848	and I wanted to say thanks to me going back and playing Guitar Hero 3 this week I actually thought to check on the Guitar Hero OL Army and I had to go back and approve requests to join from like February so if I neglected to add you to the OL Army you're there now and if you want to join the OL Army go to the Guitar Hero community site and search for OLRMY and you too can join our Guitar Hero OL Army which I promise I will update more than once every four months
1556784	1560768	Also, if you missed it in Part B last week, we had a pretty cool announcement.
1561188	1577883	Joining us next week on the program, Tommy Tallarico will be here for an extended interview where he's going to talk about video games live and his involvement with Gang, which is a big audio guild for people that are into making audio for games, whether they're already doing it or just have an interest in it.
1578423	1594279	and more video games live because it's what lots of people are talking about right now Tommy's going to be here to join us talk a lot about that it's pretty cool I'll be next week here on Orange Lounge Radio but for tonight since this is the 6th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio we do have some special things planned for you in part B we're going to bring back a couple of segments
1595663	1599884	from OLR's history, and one of them is going to be music game related.
1600425	1604566	We're going to do a list list in Part B tonight, and it does have to do with music games.
1605186	1608887	So that'll be pretty exciting, especially for our long-time listeners who remember our roots.
1609487	1612929	For now, though, gaming news throughout the gaming world.
1612949	1613749	We'll start it off with Loki.
1614389	1626177	Yes, this week we had a brand new firmware update for the PSP and it didn't really add a whole lot except for the ability to search on Google straight from the crossmedia bar.
1627157	1639285	And also the other thing that they added along with that was now that you can change the viewing speed during video playback by pressing the up and down buttons while you're watching a video.
1641242	1642783	Yeah.
1642843	1649946	And I'm sure they also tried to fix some other holes that were opened up allowing people to run homebrew and stuff.
1650787	1654048	And I know that they're already working on a custom firmware 4.0.
1654108	1658530	So, yeah.
1659091	1659671	That doesn't work.
1662225	1663505	Why is it that they're calling it 4.0?
1663545	1669847	Probably because they had so many updates that were getting close to the 4.0 anyways.
1669927	1672228	I mean, it's like 3.96 and stuff.
1672788	1681670	Might as well just go 4.0 because I guess they would consider the internet search function as a brand new feature or something like that instead of just a little update.
1682230	1684551	So, I don't know.
1684571	1685911	I think they're just running out of numbers.
1687372	1689052	Okay.
1689272	1691093	Going back to Elite Beat Agents for a minute.
1692233	1696834	because this news about the 4.0 firmware kind of bores me because they really didn't do much to call this 4.0.
1697494	1699174	I was expecting something a little more landmark.
1699815	1708036	Going back to Elite Beat Agents, it actually sold .17 million, which would be 170,000 copies, not 16,000.
1708076	1710237	That must have been just in the first week or something.
1710257	1712557	Yay, that's still not enough to get another game.
1712697	1716878	And that's also still not as much as... Eye of Judgment, right?
1716918	1719459	But that is only released, though, in two regions, though.
1719539	1720679	So you have to also count...
1722455	1723976	Whatever, you know, Owen Dunn.
1724837	1728801	I Have Judgment has sold 0.21 million copies, granted that's worldwide.
1728861	1730142	What's the money?
1731123	1732444	It didn't sell better than Crisis.
1733464	1733924	Let's see.
1734284	1736005	Comparing it to some other games.
1736766	1737126	Let's see.
1737246	1739467	Barbie and the Twelve Dancing Princesses.
1739587	1741168	Oh, we don't have sales data for that.
1741188	1741448	Let's see.
1741468	1742349	What are some of these other ones?
1742989	1743770	Maybe I can find.
1745130	1745611	Ah, there we go.
1745991	1748052	Barbie Island Princess on the DS.
1748772	1749993	0.14 million copies.
1750033	1751974	That's only 30,000 less than Owen Don.
1752194	1755616	How about Let's Ride Friends Forever?
1761304	1762465	Not in the database, sadly.
1762525	1764307	Awesome, it's so crappy it's not even there.
1764327	1766108	What about Imagine Babies?
1767189	1768450	Oh wait, I found Let's Ride Friends Forever.
1768470	1772793	Imagine Babies, you'd be surprised, is actually in the top-selling DS titles.
1773254	1774355	I don't understand it.
1774855	1775916	I honestly don't understand it.
1775936	1777137	Wow, wow, wow, get this.
1777197	1781400	Do you know how many copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever sold in its first week of release?
1781760	1782021	No.
1782041	1782021	986.
1782481	1782721	Sweet!
1782801	1783161	Add that to the...
1789252	1798459	So, yeah, you're about, what is it, 200, or 211,000 copies now of Eye of Judgment?
1798580	1802403	Okay, wow, wow, okay.
1802683	1803223	What?
1803584	1805625	Yeah, thank God, I'm sorry.
1805925	1809288	Okay, Elite Beat Agents, 170,000 copies, right?
1809468	1811150	Imagine Babies, you ready for this?
1812711	1814993	1.85 million copies have sold.
1816104	1842221	That's pervigicharts.com That makes sense though Seriously, it's weird People buy it for their little girls because they want them to know how to raise their babies It's absolutely weird That game right there is seriously up in the top of the DS charts and also Imagine Fashion Designer is up there too I vow Since I own the game thanks to somebody in this room I'm going to play Imagine Babies next week
1843260	1844641	and come back and report on it.
1845021	1845521	You do that.
1845761	1846921	You better make good on it.
1847842	1852424	Also, breaking a million copies sold, Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Happy Cooking.
1853044	1854404	How many did Cooking Mama sell?
1854444	1854844	Last one.
1855945	1857225	Cooking Mama.
1857465	1858606	Elite Beat Agents sold 170,000.
1859606	1861227	Cooking Mama sold 2.74 million copies.
1861287	1862387	What about Cooking Mama 2?
1862787	1863828	I don't think that did as well.
1864588	1866729	Cooking Mama 2, 1.19 million.
1866769	1868150	Keep in mind these are worldwide numbers.
1871151	1871751	Crazy.
1873334	1876577	Thank God I wasn't like, imagine babies, no one will buy that.
1876637	1879720	Let's just add that to the thing.
1879740	1880060	Whoops!
1880601	1881261	I'm smart.
1881822	1882642	You are very smart.
1882923	1884564	It's a good thing you didn't take that as part of the bet.
1885285	1886606	Alright, let's see.
1886706	1892271	Sony planning a clampdown on PSP pirating.
1893305	1893785	That's right.
1893866	1899691	There is a piracy problem on the PSP, said Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe president David Reeves.
1900431	1901652	And we know about it.
1901993	1902993	We know how it's done.
1903954	1909980	So basically they know how to log on to any of the many blogs out there that specifically talk about PSP hacking.
1910859	1913461	Right, they're gonna really clamp down on PSP piracy.
1913622	1919667	These were quotes from Sony's Devastation developer conference that was held in London.
1920167	1929816	And it's not all bad news because sometimes piracy, says David Reeves, fuels the growth of hardware sales.
1931437	1932678	So people buy PSP.
1932698	1933318	And you know what?
1933338	1939021	I actually kind of see that because a lot of people bought the PSP when they found out that they were able to play NES games on them.
1939601	1940182	It's kind of true.
1940382	1947385	I know a lot of people that when they first got them, that's all they did is they had me put emulators on there for them and they played NES games.
1947626	1950127	One of my friends went right out and bought one and then modded his battery.
1950987	1954130	Here's one thing to note though, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up.
1954190	1961117	He went on to say that there are plans going on that will crack down on the numbers of pirates out there.
1961377	1963019	There is nothing they can do.
1963419	1964620	Absolutely nothing.
1964700	1973489	They have said this forever and they have tried different methods and it's slowed people down but then eventually they come back around and they find a new way about it.
1974238	1975539	You have no chance.
1975679	1976639	Make your time.
1976740	1977940	Ha ha ha ha.
2001687	2006073	When was the last time that you heard about hacking being done on the PlayStation 3?
2008596	2012621	I've heard of them actually trying things, but they still haven't gotten anything to work yet.
2012741	2018528	If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation 3 has a more don't give a shit attitude towards installing Linux on it and all that stuff, right?
2018688	2018929	Yes.
2019389	2020451	That's why people don't care.
2021846	2025447	People are looking to find ways to run homebrew stuff on it.
2025808	2027888	I think mainly they're trying to find ways to pirate stuff.
2027908	2040694	But even stuff... Even, let's just say, you were able to pirate games on the PS3, it's not really as easy because, I mean, if you dump a PlayStation 3 game, that's, like, upwards to 50 gigs.
2040774	2044335	I mean, you're only going to be able to throw, like, one or two on your hard drive at a time.
2045095	2045776	I mean, it's just...
2047088	2048409	It's just more cumbersome.
2048849	2051370	Just forget it and they'll do it on the 360 instead.
2052570	2054631	Before we get to our next story, a comment from chat.
2054671	2058353	Amaze Satsuma in chat says, There is one way to stop pirates.
2059033	2060453	Send ninjas out to kill them.
2062254	2062774	There you have it.
2063435	2064515	But you know what, though?
2064815	2071638	There are ninjas that are, you know, acting in... They're participating in piracy, actually.
2071738	2076680	There's the Wii Ninja, which is a mod chip for the Wii that allows you to play pirated games.
2078551	2081014	Siren in chat says, what is a pirate?
2081514	2082975	A miserable little pile of hacks.
2083636	2084377	But enough talk.
2085257	2085938	Have at you.
2087239	2091383	Please save us from this nonsense in our chat room while we get to another story.
2091523	2092604	Rob, you killed it.
2093905	2094646	Hey, I didn't say it.
2094686	2095286	Siren said it.
2095347	2096087	Do I gotta?
2096287	2096748	You gotta.
2097677	2103423	Well, some news about the MMO that Bioware is squirting out.
2103583	2106806	They said that it's supposed to be out between April 2010 and April 2011.
2113271	2124158	Well, the article actually said that EA was funding an MMO, but EA owns Bioware, and it's in Austin, so that's where they got the information from.
2125118	2132963	And there's no more information exactly about what it's going to be, but the theory is Knights of the Old Republic, so...
2135578	2136238	Hmm.
2136899	2137519	Possible.
2137659	2138279	Hmm.
2138679	2139539	That could be interesting.
2140320	2141320	Hmm, yes, say.
2142901	2147743	Anyways, there's going to be some pretty interesting stuff coming out about Resistance 2.
2148243	2164389	Of course, just recently they had some gameplay videos that were premiering on GameTrailersTV, and now GamePro has the scoop on some more stuff, including they're going to be giving out, in random issues of GamePro, free Resistance 2 beta codes.
2165149	2166931	So you'll be able to get in on the beta for that.
2167231	2169433	And they're hoping to sell a few more magazines with that as well.
2169453	2172776	Because I don't know about you, but I don't think GamePro is doing that great right now.
2173376	2177420	There's some people out there that would buy like 10 copies to get a golden ticket, quote unquote, right?
2177680	2178260	Yeah, pretty much.
2178320	2180442	Do they say about how many of the magazines are going to have this?
2180642	2180883	Nope.
2181815	2182255	Interesting.
2182696	2191120	But they were saying that there's tons of juicy stuff in there and they're saying it's bigger than Halo, bigger than Call of Duty.
2191841	2194522	I'm sorry though, or better than Halo.
2194542	2199125	They said a lot of things are better than Halo, unfortunately.
2199885	2202927	But Resistance 2 is going to be awesome.
2203007	2205068	Resistance 1 was absolutely cool.
2205408	2210231	If you loved Call of Duty and you want more of a sci-fi game, this is perfect for you.
2212489	2225651	of course and I don't think it made tonight's show roll but I want to say something I read something about Call of Duty 6 is supposed to be like sci-fi related yeah in response to this no I would think they're just getting you know they're trying to mix it up a bit but
2226903	2231267	You know, I don't know if that worked really well for Battlefield 2142 either, though.
2231707	2234910	Because they tried to mix it up a bit and go a little sci-fi and futuristic.
2235590	2239874	You know, and Tom Clancy's been doing that, or the Tom Clancy series, I guess.
2239894	2243256	You know, with Hawks and End War and that kind of stuff.
2243737	2247520	But, you know, I honestly think that Resistance is going to be awesome.
2247540	2251263	Resistance, I absolutely, out of the first-person shooters I've played, Gears of War, Halo 3...
2254525	2255666	Just a lot of them out there.
2256326	2257327	Resistance was my favorite.
2257787	2258187	Absolutely.
2258308	2263611	Which is weird because, you know, usually I'm not too favorable on stuff for the PlayStation 3.
2263971	2266013	But, you know, it honestly is a good game.
2266733	2268054	And I'm definitely buying the next one.
2269901	2270321	All right.
2271442	2274123	I'm just kind of reading some other crazy stuff in chat.
2274243	2278264	DJ Ratchet speculates it ends up only five game pros have it.
2278864	2280305	So it actually does turn into Willy Wonka.
2280345	2286307	Well, they're assuming that's going to be over 60 since they're obviously going to be stress testing servers.
2286407	2290268	So there's going to be 60 player online with Resistance 2.
2290788	2295150	Will there be more Resistance 2 beta keys than copies of Elite Beat Agents sold?
2296850	2300353	Metal Gear Solid 4 476,334 copies were sold in the first week
2320373	2331676	and by the way, 77,208 consoles were sold that week and that is, if you kind of do the math there, that's what about like one in four, no, one in five?
2332356	2336838	So like one out of every five copies of the game sold also pushed a console.
2337718	2338338	That's pretty big.
2339599	2340059	There you have it.
2340779	2348682	Over in the UK... Yeah, because one out of every five copies was probably one of those consoles that included the game with it.
2348862	2349302	Possibly.
2350063	2356405	Over in the UK, it should be noted that Metal Gear Solid 4, while it sold well, it did not do quite as well as Grand Theft Auto 4.
2356805	2362447	It was 14,000 copies short of the Metal Gear Solid 2 release in 2002.
2364942	2372665	See, I have a bad feeling that they're going to start really fudging their numbers with, oh yeah, look how many consoles this game pushed.
2373205	2375386	Well, yeah, because you're including it with all the consoles.
2375606	2380768	Of course it's going to be kind of equal with the console sales.
2381729	2382349	You know what, though?
2382529	2386430	We even know people that have went out and bought a PlayStation 3 just for this game.
2386931	2387931	Yeah, I can believe it.
2389107	2390068	I mean, it's an awesome game.
2390248	2395253	But then again, when Final Fantasy XIII comes out, I will probably buy a PlayStation 3 just for that game, so what can you do?
2395433	2396875	Well, don't worry about that time, you know.
2397555	2399117	PlayStation 4 will be coming out, so.
2399317	2399718	Hooray!
2401259	2404102	Plus, maybe Sony Home I'll actually have to play as well.
2404142	2407545	Yeah, I'm sure it'll eventually be out, you know, in beta form, of course.
2409108	2427432	Well, for other news, if anyone's been interested in LittleBigPlanet, the Sony Experience is coming by on a bunch of trucks that has different kiosks with games in it, such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Metal Gear Solid 4 and PSP games.
2428572	2436694	And it's traveling all over the country, so if you go to us.playstation.com you can find links to tour dates there.
2437381	2438782	Do you happen to have the dates in front of you by chance?
2439263	2441605	I was just wondering if there's anything local where you can go crash.
2441826	2444128	There's very few tour dates.
2444869	2445309	That's alright.
2445890	2447351	So not a big tour right now?
2447672	2451295	No, it's like each truck's doing like four different cities and that's it.
2452617	2455920	Actually, I have three locations according to this one.
2457181	2458843	And that's just Baltimore and Milwaukee.
2459684	2460685	But maybe more to come.
2462974	2469298	When that Rock Band tour started, didn't they only have a few dates and then finally it exploded into all these places before the game came out?
2469358	2470259	Okay, here we go.
2471760	2478884	The PlayStation Patrol tour is going to Davenport, Iowa, Huntsville, Alabama I should go visit my family.
2480425	2483387	Traverse City, Michigan and New York City.
2485068	2486249	Why do they have to hate the West Coast?
2487590	2488931	Not a single West Coast date in there.
2489984	2496509	But the New York City date is July 11th through July 15th, so if any of our listeners get the urge, go check it out for us.
2496889	2499170	Yeah, and please go ask them why they hate us so much on the West Coast.
2502573	2505955	They were probably already here, and I didn't even care.
2507856	2508937	They've been here before.
2508977	2511999	They usually come to our local Sunrise Hall every now and then.
2512019	2514621	But you know we had the signing at the Metreon, right?
2515425	2516047	Yes, that's true.
2517009	2519054	I didn't see no LittleBigPlanet there.
2520558	2522182	Who cares about Metal Gear Solid?
2522222	2523565	It's all about LittleBigPlanet.
2527236	2530078	All right, go follow the tour bus or something.
2530098	2534401	And if you happen to go, take a camera or something and tell us about your experience.
2535021	2541405	Anyways, there was a whole bunch of drama last week with Itagaki leaving Tecmo and Team Ninja behind.
2541885	2545067	I'm surprised he did not tip over everything on his way out.
2546808	2548449	If he has, we probably just haven't heard it yet.
2548710	2549270	Exactly.
2549330	2553212	He probably just threw a manager through a window and then jumped down, you know?
2554298	2555280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2565195	2580910	Uh, anyways, so they have, um, served a gag order for him to, um, basically not disclose or leak any Tecmo, uh, trade secrets and, you know, make any false or misleading statements, et cetera, et cetera.
2581170	2585574	The only problem is, though, that it hasn't been signed off by the court yet, so he's talking now.
2586355	2590379	Yeah, so Nidagaki put out a press statement of his own that says, you don't tell me to shut the fuck up.
2592403	2593603	Come back and kill you again.
2593623	2594924	He's like, I do what I want.
2614449	2616010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2637529	2638370	Yes, and Motive.
2638510	2639892	Well, there could definitely be a game here.
2639912	2643456	We're going to elevate him to a Chuck Norris status.
2643596	2645838	He's going to be immortal at some point.
2645858	2648061	He is the Chuck Norris of game designers, really.
2649943	2651104	Anyways, Itagaki.
2651204	2653046	He laughs at Chuck Norris.
2654468	2657912	He doesn't have to do anything better than Chuck Norris because you think Chuck Norris is fucking funny.
2658171	2668219	Of course, Tecmo, the man, denies that Team Ninja is actually leaving them, and also kind of denying different aspects about the lawsuit.
2668960	2674525	One of the things that they say was inaccurate was that all of the employees were suing Tecmo.
2675566	2676647	Well, yes and no.
2676727	2681210	It's actually two employees suing Tecmo on behalf of all the other employees, so...
2682375	2684376	It's like some sort of convoluted class action.
2684717	2686858	Yeah, there's a whole lot of weird stuff going on there.
2686878	2688919	Japanese law is kind of funny anyway.
2689139	2691301	Not paying overtime and that kind of thing, you know.
2692322	2692642	I don't know.
2696244	2701247	Is this why, you know, Tecmo Bowl is just taking forever to come out?
2701267	2702768	But Team Ninja doesn't do Tecmo Bowl.
2703289	2704830	Team Ninja should do Tecmo Bowl.
2706755	2707476	NinjaBowl.
2708218	2708678	I'll be fine.
2708698	2710301	There's... Rob, okay.
2710321	2711283	Do you remember Battle Chess?
2711964	2712084	Yeah.
2712164	2712525	Oh, yeah.
2712565	2712846	Hell, yeah.
2712946	2715250	Where they would, like, kill each other and everything?
2715370	2715771	That was awesome.
2715791	2717193	They should have, like, Battle Football.
2717794	2718055	All right.
2718495	2718756	All right.
2718876	2719197	Where they...
2719750	2719990	Uh-oh.
2720471	2720671	What?
2720891	2724253	Well, listen, this is what Itagaki's new job's going to be, okay?
2724614	2724974	Alright.
2725875	2742167	Basically, if you imagine, you know, like a kitchen stadium, except it's not a kitchen stadium, it's just a stadium with Itagaki being the chairman, and he has people fight each other to the death with a secret weapon that is revealed on each show.
2744509	2744909	I like it.
2746567	2750891	So Itagaki should not be so worried about this divorce from Tecmo because he will be a rock star elsewhere.
2750992	2751872	Oh yeah, they'll pick him up.
2752853	2754335	Microsoft will probably have him work for him.
2755236	2755616	I don't know.
2755836	2756077	Nice.
2757785	2758586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2781616	2782376	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2811448	2815470	and the system here, little Sony Ericsson, comes with games on it.
2816110	2818991	Bowling, Bash Fishing, and Jockey.
2819471	2824913	And all of them use an accelerometer that is actually located inside the device as well.
2825274	2827394	Why in the hell does your phone need an accelerometer?
2827495	2832156	I'm not sure, unless it knows to shut off if it's falling out of your pocket or something.
2832196	2832577	I don't know.
2833357	2833557	But...
2834733	2835673	It does have one in it.
2836874	2840515	Or if it senses that you're falling for a long time, it's like, you're falling to your death.
2840535	2841655	Do you wish to call loved ones?
2842075	2842536	Yes or no?
2847617	2847917	Nice.
2849678	2852419	It shouldn't ask you yes or no because all it's going to get is, ah!
2852439	2855380	That's all it's going to get.
2856732	2857453	Death Death Death Death Death
2879904	2883008	It was fake in the movie, but it was real when Itagaki did it.
2883969	2887253	Except he landed and he's like, fuck this, I'm too cool to die.
2887394	2888415	And then shot the plane down.
2888795	2889076	Alright.
2891979	2892400	Alright.
2893141	2896585	Well, how about some completely innocent and happy news?
2896825	2897206	No!
2898147	2898588	Disney!
2900387	2905670	This makes me kind of... I just think it's funny because I'm going to have to draw the parallel, okay?
2906551	2915257	Disney is making a game about a dog who shoots laser beams from his eyes and barks with a sonic boom.
2915657	2916217	Wait a minute.
2917558	2918839	I think I've heard of this game before.
2920760	2921041	What?
2921161	2921881	Go ahead, continue on.
2921961	2923102	It's an animated movie.
2924163	2925844	And his owner is called Penny.
2926884	2929106	Who, besides me, is singing Inspector Gadget?
2930675	2932216	I'm sorry Brain is not that cool.
2933457	2936660	Okay, but it's a girl named Penny who hacks.
2937680	2938281	She's a hacker.
2939122	2941263	This is Inspector Gadget, but with a cooler dog.
2941363	2942524	Little kids are not hackers.
2942925	2947448	It's like you mix Inspector Gadget and the dog and give him John Travolta's voice.
2947488	2954293	Wait, I have a question for the nerdy... I have a question for nerdy heterosexual straight guys in chat.
2954834	2955494	Instapoll here.
2956035	2957776	Heterosexual nerdy straight guys only.
2958336	2960138	Did you have a crush on Penny growing up?
2962495	2963376	or Lesbians.
2963876	2966198	Damn Skippy, she was hot.
2967339	2969320	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
2969401	2970682	I had my issues as a kid.
2971742	2973724	She was the only smart one in the whole damn place.
2973744	2975405	Into schoolboy lust.
2985516	2988797	To continue, the dog's name is Bolt.
2989897	2996639	And it's basically him and Penny traveling the world and taking care of shit.
2997199	3002640	But it is actually going to be on everything but the PSP.
3003880	3013803	And it's going to tie in with a movie about a famous dog with superpowers who's on a television show and gets shipped to New York by accident so he's trying to get back to Hollywood.
3014483	3016424	and John Travolta is doing his voice.
3017865	3028911	And for those people who may be interested, it was, I'm not sure if it still is, animated by the same people that did, or the same artists, I should say, that did Lilo and Stitch.
3029592	3030752	So, it's pretty cool.
3031112	3038176	All right, let's check out the results of our instant quick poll, brought to you by our chat room, chat.orangelunchradio.com.
3038216	3042399	Question was, for the heterosexual men in our chat room,
3043684	3044644	was Penny hot?
3045144	3065749	Yes, yes, hell yeah, yes, lol, Penny was cool, no, no, no, no, I thought she was awesome, I thought Brain was hotter, I was too young, what the fuck, no, yeah, Penny was hot, even for a lol, I'll say no, I didn't think she was hot, blonde pigtails, pigtails equals handles, Penny was hot.
3067210	3072375	No, I was too busy as a child crushing on Sasami from Tenshi Muyo.
3072555	3073175	Oh, wow.
3073275	3074617	That definitely dates you.
3074917	3079581	And my favorite, Vicky from Small Wonder greater than Penny from Inspector Gadget.
3079981	3082864	What, because you like a robo-chick that can, you know, not wear out?
3084105	3084425	All right.
3085366	3087488	Thank you, chat room, for participating in that.
3090168	3091950	We better have Harley!
3091970	3092130	Harley!
3117768	3129524	Including The Flash, Robin, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Black Canary, Hawkman, and Power Girl Cool!
3130024	3130926	She's got big boobs
3133448	3133708	Sorry!
3134169	3134669	No, you know what?
3134729	3137150	I'm glad she said that because I don't really follow comics.
3137170	3138591	I have no idea who Power Girl is.
3138611	3141193	Is she a girl dressed up like a Duracell battery or something?
3141253	3145115	I have to... Okay, Power Girl is actually Supergirl from a different universe.
3145355	3148637	So she's exactly the same person as Supergirl but has these humongous boobs.
3148998	3150078	That's like the only difference.
3150438	3151279	Big-breasted universe.
3151579	3152179	I can dig that.
3152199	3152860	I can dig that.
3153820	3155762	Anyways, they're also saying...
3157478	3162480	That there's a possible two-game deal and download content as well.
3162700	3164420	She has big boobies.
3164500	3165140	Look at that.
3165921	3166101	See?
3166221	3168882	No, look at the picture that Alex Ross did, okay?
3168942	3169762	I'm looking away now.
3170122	3170682	But hold on.
3170942	3174103	On this Justice League Unlimited... That's a stupid cartoon.
3174283	3176084	Well, she does not have big boobies there.
3176144	3181326	She has weird... She has... Her boobs look like a cucumber stuffed on her shirt.
3181406	3181826	Rob.
3182006	3182226	What?
3182566	3185647	Look up Power Girl and Alex Ross and look at... That's the picture he did.
3186806	3187006	Yes.
3188167	3190309	Those are... Wow.
3190990	3193232	I think I saw boobs like that on the Jerry Springer show once.
3193272	3193853	That's about it.
3196155	3196415	Alright.
3198137	3200699	Gee, I have no idea why that character was picked for the game.
3201640	3207225	I mean, Robin I've heard of, Wonder Woman I've heard of, pretty much every single one of those other characters you've named I've heard of.
3207526	3210749	Power Girl I had never heard of, but now I understand why she's in the game.
3213288	3215370	There's a few others I wouldn't mind seeing in it.
3215450	3216151	I want Harley.
3217292	3218232	I want Harley Quinn.
3218272	3218973	What's up with that?
3219914	3220554	What's up with that?
3220855	3221475	What is up with that?
3222156	3222456	All right.
3223097	3224558	What's up with this?
3224598	3229142	Seriously, if you look at some of these, just do a Google image search.
3229602	3232284	They've got one that's like, crap.
3233966	3234306	Wow.
3235187	3236388	Yeah, that's pretty busty.
3236428	3236748	Approval.
3236768	3237169	Massive approval.
3242560	3247603	Loki, have you ever heard of Power Girl before tonight?
3247703	3247863	Nope.
3248404	3249544	But now you'll never forget.
3249945	3253927	No, I probably will.
3254548	3259591	I've made no secret of it that I'm not the world's biggest DC fan, but I've got characters I like.
3260091	3261492	And I like her because she's bitchy.
3261753	3262273	Which is fair.
3263374	3264474	And she's got boobs.
3264614	3265215	She's bitchy.
3266584	3271847	Hitstun says Harley Quinn was the first character I made in Soul Calibur 3 in the create your own character mode.
3272607	3280572	I think the first character I made was a totally naked person wearing a bishop's hat that did like capoeira dancing or something.
3280592	3281272	It was crazy.
3282333	3283573	All right.
3284093	3284434	Anyhow.
3285552	3302938	I have no idea how to segue into this story so I will just say the ESRB is sadly going to probably no longer be leaking game announcements early because you know we find out about all these cool games because they show up on the ESRB's website like there was Earthbound coming to the Wii, right?
3303478	3304419	We found out about that early.
3304999	3307380	Castlevania, the full name of that game.
3307440	3310040	Why are you still laughing, Loki?
3310561	3313902	So speaking of big boobs... I hear giggling in my right ear.
3314702	3315303	Oh, it's Andrew?
3315543	3316825	He's... I don't know.
3316865	3319529	He started off a joke, and I don't know where it's going.
3319810	3319910	Right.
3319930	3321693	But anyways... Is it from the toilet paper book?
3322073	3322454	Probably.
3322915	3327461	I was gonna say, though, yeah, it sucks that the ESRB's not gonna be... Wait, wait, I didn't even say why.
3327542	3327842	Hold on.
3328603	3329404	Let me finish the story.
3329805	3330005	Fine.
3330886	3331887	I'm just excited.
3358727	3364752	If publishers arbitrarily select dates bearing no reasonable relationships to consumers' interest in the product.
3365533	3377602	But, it should be noted, this would still have no effect on some of the other ways that games have been leaked through official agencies such as the OFLC in Australia, and so on.
3377763	3378943	Now, Loki, you had a comment.
3379164	3380645	That's exactly what I was going to say.
3380765	3382847	Well, that doesn't stop everybody else from doing it.
3383827	3388011	And besides, you know, there's a lot of other ways to find out about leaked dates.
3390465	3391746	But you don't know of any of them, right?
3392146	3392606	Of course not.
3392926	3393347	Of course not.
3393887	3394227	All right.
3394267	3394888	Well, you know what?
3395768	3399970	I don't know about you guys, but I kind of liked when the ESRB would leak things early.
3400010	3404913	And now I feel like I'm going to be sitting in the dark until they want me to know about release dates.
3404933	3406754	And I like ruining Christmas.
3406814	3408515	I like finding out about stuff early.
3408595	3411236	So this ESRB news kind of makes me a little bit angsty.
3411596	3414238	And when I get angsty, we cue the FU music.
3430859	3459544	just a massive F you to the assholes on the Ragnarok server I play on who are duplicating items and selling them and basically doing a whole bunch of shit that's now I wouldn't say it's completely ruined everything but it's made things difficult for other people so fuck you to them Loki F you to PHP for being needlessly complicated and F you to my car for leaking coolant
3460714	3460994	Don't.
3461354	3462094	That's not good.
3462474	3470377	Especially when the people that flushed my radiator and checked a bunch of stuff because they thought my car had overheated, even though it hadn't.
3471117	3474678	And ever since they fixed it, it's been leaking coolant.
3477718	3477939	Nice.
3479679	3480999	I have two FUs of the week.
3481479	3487041	My first FU goes to me for spending $10 to go watch The Happening, which was horrible.
3488376	3494338	and not even like so bad it was good, like Showgirls, you know, bad, but it was just bad.
3494918	3496358	It was really, really bad.
3497859	3504741	My other FU goes to the fact, and this is a much bigger FU, my other FU goes to the fact that I had to have not just one, but two MRIs last week.
3505861	3513623	I went in for an MRI, because you know, if you've been listening to this show the past three months, you know I've been having issues with my pancreas that kept me out a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital, blah, blah, blah, cry me a river.
3514318	3516921	I don't have to They were probably trying to illuminate your pancreas
3531195	3538261	Well, no, it's not so much that drinking and stuff is horrible, but having to leave work early, go to this place, whatever.
3538521	3540183	So I went in on Thursday, had it done.
3540223	3541784	They call me at 5 o'clock at night.
3542364	3551172	Oh, Rob, the thing that your doctor wanted to see doesn't come out clear in our MRI thing because we have an older MRI thing out here in Folsom.
3551472	3554655	We need you to go to our Roseville office where they have a newer MRI machine.
3555919	3558180	Things you could have told me about the first time.
3558240	3560881	It wasn't written on there what my doctor was looking for or nothing.
3560941	3565323	I mean, if you didn't think it was going to come up on the old one, why didn't you just tell me to go to the new place to start with?
3565764	3570326	Instead of making me miss two days of work and have to drink that nasty, nasty stuff twice.
3571726	3575188	So, but anyway, I'm hoping the MRIs show that I'm healthy again.
3575528	3577469	Because otherwise I'll be filled with more FUs.
3578269	3579150	And nobody wants that.
3579290	3579530	Andrew.
3581431	3585232	First of all, FU to GameStop for closing at 6 on Sundays.
3585412	3590673	I was going to go in and apparently they were giving away Deoxys at GameStop all weekend.
3591433	3592873	Just missed it by two minutes.
3593453	3593874	D'oh!
3594914	3598274	FU to the community on Team Fortress 2.
3599575	3601575	Achievement pack comes out for, say, Pyro.
3601715	3602275	What do you have?
3602515	3604116	All sorts of Pyros on the servers.
3604376	3605096	Nothing else.
3605876	3606916	Easy pickings were heavy, though.
3607656	3611037	And FU to Hellgate for being such a bitch and a half to install.
3612984	3616365	Alright, that's going to do it then for our FUs of the Week.
3618386	3619566	Miklatov left the room.
3619706	3623127	I guess he finished the book so he had to go find something else to do.
3624268	3629229	Alright, so now we're going to move into some release dates and travel around the world and see what's coming out where.
3630049	3631870	Release dates, we'll start off with DarkSakura.
3632881	3635884	We have releases, and stuff is coming out the end.
3636144	3636564	No, I'm kidding.
3637485	3639927	On the 27th, there's a whole ton of crap for the UK.
3640387	3643890	We have Battlefield Bad Company on Xbox 360 and PS3.
3644631	3648975	Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic Games on stuff.

3656721	3658963	Harvest Fishing on DS, whatever.
3659804	3682786	Kung Fu Panda on Damn Near Everything Else, Looney Tunes Cartoon Concerto on DS, NASCAR 09 PS3, whatever, Pro Cycling Manager 2008 on PC, Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy on PS3 and Xbox 360, Summer Warriors 2 on PC, SBK08 Superbike World Championship on a ton of crap,
3684367	3690129	Sims City Society's Destinations on PC Super Smash Bros.

3721424	3727588	Also, Top Spin 3 on Xbox 360, the PS3, and the DS.
3728709	3734632	Battlefield Bad Company on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, as well as the Gold Edition for those.
3735453	3737814	The SimCity Box for PC.
3738075	3740196	I'm assuming that's just a box set of the SimCity games.
3741217	3741317	Um...
3742344	3750910	Command & Conquer 3, Kane's Wrath on the Xbox 360, or if you're looking for another strategy game, Supreme Commander on Xbox 360.

3776385	3779986	My Weight Loss Coach on the DS, which includes a free pedometer.
3780006	3781307	Yippee.
3781947	3782507	It's neat.
3783188	3784808	It's kind of interesting.
3785448	3785809	I'll give it.
3785849	3786409	It's different.
3786969	3787369	It's different.
3787389	3788210	It's not for everybody.
3788350	3792691	It's not a bad thing that the fitness craze has taken over in the video game world right now.
3793412	3794032	Better than nothing.
3794813	3799137	Gourmet Chef for the DS, which is a cookbook type of game, I think.
3799698	3802121	And it also has a cooking sim portion of it.
3802781	3805164	Political Machines 2008 on PC.
3806225	3810570	Operation Darkness on the 360, which looks pretty awesome.
3811431	3815054	Hellboy the Science of Evil on PSP, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
3816816	3817676	on the DS.

3820237	3824379	Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2, or A2.

3828901	3832842	Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2, The Phantom Fortress on the PSP.
3834363	3835883	Big Beach Sports on the Wii.
3836744	3840425	The Midnight Play Pack on the DS, which I think is a bunch of cell phone games.
3841686	3844767	Code Lyoko, Fall of Xena on the DS.
3846098	3850942	Overlord Raising Hell on the PS3 which is just Overlord and all the other expansions for that.
3853063	3854024	Let's see here.
3857367	3865212	Elements on the PC and I think there was one other thing I missed here.
3867034	3871037	Let's see here.
3871097	3873299	Cakemania 2 on the DS and
3874150	3895727	Deadliest Catch, Alaskan Storm on Xbox 360 if you want to be a crab fisher I guess Guitar Hero Aerosmith that's coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, PS3 and the Wii as well as bundles and all those and that would be it
3896923	3897303	Lone of the Dark
3917509	3921834	Yeah, there was a little bit of controversy over that, because Atari's accusing people of...
3935794	3939176	To their offense, they didn't play a pirated version.
3939196	3941637	It's just they got one that someone broke street on.
3942177	3950801	So it's not necessarily their fault, but I still think it's fucked up that Atari's like, oh, we don't want any independent reviews out there because God forbid it, you know.
3951381	3954023	I would have told them I was going to give it a good review, but fuck you.
3955504	3955885	I don't know.
3956445	3957586	It's annoying.
3958326	3966792	Let's not forget, though, and we do have another story about this game, but let's not forget that Driver 3, Atari paid off people to give it good reviews.
3967593	3969094	Just keep that fresh in your mind.
3969695	3971096	Yikes.
3972016	3975519	Rapid Slasher in chat says, if you buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith, you are a tool.
3977389	3978430	My husband's buying it.
3978610	3979511	Take it back.
3980111	3981092	My husband's buying it.
3982814	3983474	Take it back.
3985516	3986937	You don't want to face the wrath of Jamie.
3987638	3989339	It is a waste of money, in my opinion.
3990500	3993523	I don't care for these add-on games that are coming out in the middle there.
3994966	3997507	I mean, you could put that stuff out as download content.
3997607	4000068	I think the song list could have been a little better.
4000368	4015575	Because I saw the finalized song list today and, you know, it's... I just don't understand why they can't do, like, say, like a $20 download thing or something like that for Guitar Hero 3 and just call it... Because they did that with, what was it, Samurai Warriors 2 Empires or something like that.
4016095	4020397	They were going to release its own 360 game for that, but they decided, hey, you know what?
4020697	4022277	It's not really that much different.
4022317	4026579	I mean, it's just kind of an add-on, so we're just going to release this as download content, and that's what they did.
4027179	4028920	I don't understand why they just don't do that with this.
4030000	4030740	He took it back.
4030900	4032421	Probably because of the PS2 owners.
4032721	4033561	Damn right he took it back.
4033581	4034942	For you and far between as we are.
4036363	4039245	Yeah, but you can release it on those systems, but just don't release it.
4039285	4040786	Just like the Rock Band trackpacks.
4041207	4045830	They can release that stuff standalone, or you can do a download for cheaper.
4046070	4050333	Now, Rapid Slasher clarifies the comment and says it's just that the song list is really weak.
4050393	4051294	And I kind of agree.
4051474	4053035	My husband's favorite band is Aerosmith.
4054396	4055357	Well, then, there you go.
4055377	4058179	He probably won't be too interested in Guitar Hero Metallica next year.
4058860	4059600	That's for me.
4060261	4062242	Guitar Hero Tool isn't a bad idea, though.
4063003	4063063	Um...
4065058	4072265	I like Aerosmith and all, but I'm more of just a fan of Guitar Hero and I wouldn't mind having a lot of new songs to play from.
4073687	4076910	I'm not buying any of these games until Guitar Hero DVD comes out.
4078655	4080116	Well, I kind of want a new guitar, too.
4080176	4081397	My other one is starting to break.
4081437	4082458	I've had it since Guitar Hero 2.
4083379	4086982	But I need a guitar that's going to be compatible with Rock Band, or I'm just not interested.
4087162	4089544	Well, then you probably don't want a Guitar Hero guitar.
4090045	4091326	God, so stupid.
4091786	4093207	I hate both of those companies.
4093728	4098171	I really shouldn't buy any of these games anymore until they find a way to make it work.
4098191	4102235	Well, the 360, though, you do have to remember that they are at least compatible with each other.
4102795	4104397	Whereas if you had a PS3, you're fucked.
4105638	4105878	All right.
4107296	4109096	Dark Tetsuya's Guitar Hero Journey.
4109156	4110397	Yes, I would be there first in line.
4110457	4111777	I'd pre-order it the minute it was announced.
4112117	4112697	Alright, anyhow.
4114118	4115578	Getting over to Japanese release dates.
4115638	4121219	My usual source of information of Japanese release dates is not working right now, so I have an abbreviated list for you guys.
4122140	4126661	Over in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, they get Battlefield Bad Company comes out.
4126701	4132342	On the PlayStation 3, The Darkness finally makes its way to Japan, as well as Quake Wars, or Enemy Territory Quake Wars.
4132842	4136643	And on the Nintendo Re... Nintendo... Did I say Nintendo Re...
4138787	4139468	The Wii!
4139548	4140148	The Wii!
4140308	4141549	Ford Racing!
4142009	4147492	Ford Racing Off-Road was what I was starting to say, but somehow combined it all into one word.
4148372	4148752	Lovely.
4149513	4151353	Alright, that's going to do it for release dates.
4154695	4159277	Well, there's other stuff in case anyone is interested.
4159797	4161939	And I am particularly interested in this myself.
4162899	4164840	Okay, you know what one of my favorite games ever is?
4167080	4185147	um Custer's Revenge hell no Dragon's Lair and um the 25th anniversary of Dragon's Lair is coming about and so the um uh artistic uh I would say uh well the animator that's behind it Don Bluth um is uh
4186287	4196949	From what I understand, it's going to be doing an autographed version of the game for a week that will be on DVD, PC, and Blu-ray.
4197249	4204531	It's also going to be designed by Rick Dyer, who was the designer, and two of the other animators, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy.
4204711	4210332	Hopefully the Blu-ray version actually works this time instead of it being broken.
4211197	4220299	Well, they said the Blu-ray version is supposed to run at 1080p and play just like the original coin-op version.
4221059	4224900	And there's supposed to be lobby posters that are $80 each.
4225840	4226260	Jeez.
4226860	4228280	Can we get Space Ace while we're at it?
4228901	4229501	I know, right?
4229921	4233021	Well, maybe when the anniversary for Space Ace comes about.
4233081	4235082	How about they just animate a new, like, Dragon's Lair 3?
4237069	4238249	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4257595	4259097	Like, the music in it was very creepy.
4259217	4260058	You know what I want?
4260178	4264143	I want a Clerks animated game that's done just like Dragon's Lair.
4264623	4265604	You can have, who's driving car?
4265644	4266465	Bear's driving car!
4266546	4266866	Left!
4268448	4268768	I don't know.
4268968	4270049	How can this be?
4270090	4273113	There could be a Clerks game somewhere, I'm just not sure that's it, Loki.
4273133	4275696	Yeah, but I don't think the market's real open for in-action games.
4277698	4278219	Wah, wah.
4281078	4285744	Just set it right in front of you.
4298661	4305163	That will feature a gun peripheral for the Wii that's kind of like, you know, something that you strap the remote into.
4305323	4311204	But when you're not playing the Wii, you can actually turn it into a real Nerf gun and fire at people's heads.
4311944	4314085	Like God intended it.
4315145	4319827	It will be $59.99 and will include, of course, the gun shell.
4320187	4321007	It's due out November 17th.
4322813	4323174	DarkSakura.com
4338578	4343484	We're about done with the first half here of episode number 284, our sixth anniversary show.
4343845	4350132	But we could not say goodbye to Part A without taking a moment, as we have for quite a while now here on the program, and paying respect to our elders.
4350172	4356179	And we do that through a little segment we like to call the Classic Video Game of the Week, where Jamie's going to dig through the archives.
4357080	4366584	and pick a game in the dusty corner of a closet that she thinks needs a little more respect from you kids that were only seven years old when this show started and so on.
4366664	4369165	So, DarkSakura, what is this week's classic game of the week?
4369565	4372286	It's a game that I literally tripped on this morning in the vault.
4373086	4374687	It had fallen and I tripped on it.
4375807	4380909	It's SNK Gauss Fighter, which was on Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000.
4382150	4383190	Play some of that music.
4392475	4393015	You know what?
4394756	4401618	My friend over at the local plane trade has one of those and he says he'll sell it to me if I wanted it.
4401658	4404279	I'm like, I don't know what I'd do with that.
4404539	4406480	It has a really good version of Puzzle Bobble on it.
4408121	4409321	I'm sorry, Puzzle Bobble.
4409521	4411922	I can only play so many versions of Puzzle Bobble.
4412830	4414031	We used to keep it in our bathroom.
4414472	4417415	It has Neo Geo Card Fighters on it.
4418556	4419097	No thanks.
4419257	4420738	Card Fighters Clash was actually pretty cool.
4421199	4432270	But anyway, you've got basically different SNK female characters, hence SNK Gauss Fighters, that are playable in the game.
4432330	4435093	It's a 2D sort of weird monocolor...
4436214	4442416	The Neo Geo Pocket Color did not have that great of a color capability, so the characters are pretty monotone.
4443476	4446457	And they're all in SD sprites, so it's pretty cute.
4448097	4454079	However, the characters that are in this game are... You have Mai Shiranui...
4455439	4473745	Athena, Yuri, Leona, Shermie, who I named my cat after, Nakaruru, Shiki, Akari from The Last Blade, Hidden are also Whip from King of Fighters, and Yuki Kushinada from King of Fighters 97, and your boss is Miss X, which I think is funny.
4473845	4479667	Rob, do you remember that Margaret Cho sketch that she talked about being raised by drag queens?
4480228	4480428	Yes.
4480448	4482108	One of them was named Miss X. Yes.
4482368	4484069	And Miss X is Iori Agami in drag.
4485222	4485483	Nice.
4485784	4485985	Yeah.
4487008	4488052	So I thought I would share that.
4491457	4502680	And actually, one of the characters, Yuki, is actually, the one I was mentioning before, is actually Kyo's girlfriend and it's the only game she's ever fought in.
4503581	4517045	So, a bunch of the other guys make, you know, cameos, like you have Kyo, Ryo, Takuma, Seikenso, and Yashiro, a few other people, so...
4517765	4519406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4543007	4545269	Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
