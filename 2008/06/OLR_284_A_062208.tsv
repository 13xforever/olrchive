61000	62000	I'm recovering from my milkshake
62000	64000	Did your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?
65000	66000	It brought something
66000	67000	Alright
69000	70000	It brought gas
71000	73000	Say hello to as well TechMaster
73000	74000	You're so gross
74000	77000	Say hello as well to TechMaster Loki
77000	79000	How would a milkshake bring you gas?
79000	82000	I don't know, it's just the first thing my toilet brain went to
82000	84000	Alright, I too finished the milkshake
85000	86000	Did you?
86000	90000	I went and got my, cause I went and stopped by Burger King and I got a large milkshake and a large soda
91000	92000	And what did it bring you?
93000	94000	Uh, cooling
94000	95000	Cooling?
96000	97000	Alright
97000	98000	Yeah, cause I'm not so hot anymore
98000	99000	Alright, sounds good
100000	102000	Are you seriously freaking cold?
102000	103000	I mean
103000	109000	I just, I need like something to cover up while I'm under all of this
109000	115000	Let me introduce, since Loki's already yelling at somebody, he has not been on our show in quite some time
115000	116000	About a year
116000	118000	But he's, well a year is quite some time
118000	119000	I was just quantifying it
119000	120000	Alright
120000	122000	But Miklotov is here tonight
122000	123000	Hello
123000	127000	And Miklotov ran away from our program to go be in Kansas for a little while, right?
127000	128000	Yeah
128000	129000	Alright
129000	132000	And he walked into the studio tonight wearing a blanket
132000	137000	Cause it feels cozy after you eat a lot of food, it's like oh I'm just gonna relax
137000	140000	I would like to point out it's over a hundred degrees outside here in lovely Sacramento, California
140000	143000	It feels, this is like a nice blanket, it's not heavy so it feels fine
143000	146000	But I'm just saying it's like a, it's a hundred degrees outside
146000	147000	Hold on
147000	150000	And we had to have the lights off before the show to keep it cool in here
150000	153000	We have like two fans going, the door open to the house
154000	157000	Yeah, we might return the lights off, screw Justin TV, it's not a, it's not a video show
157000	158000	And
158000	162000	And I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a shirt underneath
162000	163000	And shorts
163000	164000	And now a blanket
164000	165000	And a blanket
165000	166000	And why, just because
166000	167000	Because it feels nice
167000	171000	Because it's, yeah if you eat a lot of food and then you're like oh I'm so stuffed and
171000	172000	you don't want to move
172000	174000	It always feels better to just have something that you kind of wrap yourself up in
174000	179000	Like you were the food and this is your shell, like a tostada or something
179000	183000	Okay, uh, tell us what you've been up to for the past year, anything exciting?
185000	187000	Hmm, no
187000	188000	Okay
188000	190000	I almost got hit by a tornado
190000	192000	That's, I think that's kind of cool
192000	194000	That's what happens in Kansas, huh?
194000	198000	Yeah, it interrupted wow and it wasn't very fun because I had to stop playing wow for
198000	199000	a minute
199000	200000	Gotcha
200000	201000	And go check on the tornado
201000	205000	Are you still in touch, you used to work at the Konami building but then they don't have
205000	206000	their offices here in NorCal
206000	207000	Yeah
207000	209000	I don't know what you can or can't say about the past or the future
209000	213000	Oh, I'm working for them as an independent contractor
213000	214000	Ah, very cool
214000	217000	Can you talk about anything, probably not, huh?
217000	218000	Stuff
218000	219000	No, it's whatever I always do
219000	220000	Alright
220000	221000	You doing stuff?
221000	222000	As arrows
222000	223000	Alright
223000	224000	Hey, those lights went off
224000	229000	Alright, let's change the topic and talk about our gaming weeks
229000	233000	We always like to start the show off talking about what we've been playing in our weeks
233000	236000	and we'll start it off ladies first, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
236000	240000	Um, I played Ragnarok and Pinball, as usual
240000	246000	And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm still waiting for Dan to bring me back, the world ends with you
246000	248000	so I have no idea what's going on
248000	250000	That's it
250000	253000	Alrighty, Loki
253000	257000	Um, I got an R4 this week so I was playing some DS games
257000	263000	and I tried playing, um, what was it, uh, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan
263000	270000	but that game is boring, absolutely boring since it's all in Japanese and I can't read any of it
270000	273000	I'm like, seriously, when am I gonna get to the boob poking, okay?
273000	278000	But, uh, yeah, just, it's, uh, One Trick Pony it seems like
278000	284000	Um, and then, uh, I tried a bit of, um, Band Brothers
284000	286000	which is actually pretty, pretty neat
286000	289000	Um, a little difficult to figure out how to play it though
289000	293000	but, um, still a pretty cool music game, it'd be nice to see that brought over here
293000	298000	Um, then also played, um, Jump Ultra Superstars
298000	303000	which, um, I guess people compare it to Smash Brothers a little bit
303000	305000	I wouldn't say it's quite like Smash Brothers
305000	308000	There's a lot of characters in it for sure and I like how you can, um,
308000	313000	kind of combine different pieces of artwork and stuff to, you know, allow you to switch characters
313000	315000	and add abilities and stuff like that
315000	319000	So I'd say it's more like Marvel vs. Capcom or something like that
319000	320000	which is pretty cool
320000	324000	And then, um, played a little bit of that Still Live game
324000	328000	I mean, it's pretty much very similar to the, uh, Flash Portal games
328000	332000	so if you've played that you, you know, pretty much have played this game as well
332000	337000	And, um, Point Blank DS because I was trying to find that everywhere
337000	340000	and no one sold it and just kind of gave up on it
340000	345000	I mean, Point Blank DS is pretty much, you know, just like Point Blank without a gun
345000	348000	and just using the stylus and actually pretty fun
348000	351000	So, uh, too bad that that didn't do very well
351000	355000	And then of course on top of all that stuff I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV
355000	357000	Because that's fun
357000	362000	So, what does this device do, this R4, for those that don't know?
362000	368000	It allows you to run homebrew on your DS and also you can, you know, run ROMs as well
368000	369000	for DS games
369000	374000	Basically it uses a micro SD card and you can throw stuff on there
374000	379000	It's good for, like, playing import stuff, you know, especially if you're just looking to try out a game
379000	382000	and don't actually plan on buying it
382000	386000	What the hell is this?
391000	394000	Aw, I was waiting for the singing to start
394000	398000	Yo ho yo ho, a pirate's life for me, bad joke
398000	400000	You need to queue up your jokes next time
400000	402000	Terrible, I know
402000	405000	Aw, that one would have been better
405000	409000	I'm glad to know after six years things still don't work right on this program
409000	410000	Awesome
410000	415000	And then other, well, I was working on some other things
415000	423000	I posted a video on Game Trail, because I mean the post-it on the YouTube community we have
423000	425000	But I forgot how to, so
425000	427000	Well, it was like the easiest thing in the world
427000	431000	It is the easiest thing in the world, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, okay
431000	433000	So tell us a little bit, because this is kind of exciting
433000	436000	Because Orange Launch Radio hasn't done anything video related
436000	438000	I mean, we don't really count just in TV
438000	440000	I mean, no offense to just the TV people
440000	442000	But this is just a camera pointed at people doing a radio show
442000	445000	It's really not that exciting, but you wanted it, so hey
445000	450000	But this is the first real video thing we've done in a long time
450000	452000	So tell us a little more about what you did
452000	455000	I actually finally got my video set up working at home
455000	458000	Because I've been trying forever to get my damn capture card to work
458000	461000	And be able to play something at the same time
461000	465000	It actually involved me bringing back the old TV that was in the arcade cabinet
465000	469000	Back from work, and putting it on the floor next to my computer
469000	472000	And actually running it from the game system to the TV
472000	475000	And then the TV to the capture card
475000	477000	And it actually works perfect that way
477000	479000	So I captured a bunch of footage
479000	482000	I've been playing around with this glitch in Grand Theft Auto 4
482000	484000	With an evil swing set
484000	487000	And I put it all to the music of Weapon of Choice
487000	490000	Edited it together, and it's kind of funny
490000	493000	And I know when he describes it, it doesn't sound that exciting
493000	497000	But I actually watched a video, and I'm not even that big a Grand Theft Auto person
497000	501000	I know it's a good game and all, but I just don't get into those types of games as much as everyone else
501000	504000	I kind of laughed, it was really funny, it was well done
504000	506000	It fit the music so well
506000	511000	I tried, I spent long hours trying to get it to go with the music
511000	513000	Making video is a bitch
513000	516000	I've done video for an online game that Shane and I are involved with
516000	518000	And it's a pain in the ass
518000	520000	It took me all night to do a two and a half minute video
520000	525000	Yeah, it's a three minute video, and I started with like four hours of video
525000	527000	And I cut it down to three minutes
527000	529000	I bet the wife loves it
529000	532000	Oh yeah, she loves the fact that I'm sitting there doing all that stuff
532000	534000	Yeah, absolutely loves it
536000	540000	No, and then after I finished that, then I started working on something else
540000	543000	Which I was hoping to have done today, but it's not
543000	545000	So you'll have to wait
545000	550000	Can you give us any hints?
550000	551000	Maybe
551000	553000	I'll say something
553000	557000	Something that people have been asking for for a long, long time
557000	559000	Loki is making happen
559000	560000	Yeah
560000	561000	We'll say that
561000	562000	Alright
562000	564000	So so much for your gaming week, is that it?
564000	565000	Yeah
565000	567000	Why is the Unabomber at our window?
567000	569000	It looks like it's Andrew, not the Unabomber
569000	571000	I know it's Andrew
571000	575000	I'll go next, I didn't even know he was coming
575000	577000	I'll go next and talk about my gaming week
577000	579000	Oh my god, it's the Unabomber
579000	581000	Hi, how are you?
581000	583000	Get him on a mic somehow
583000	585000	Oh, the fourth mic's not hooked up now
585000	587000	I didn't know you were coming, that's alright
587000	589000	I wouldn't miss it for the world
589000	590000	Yeah, this is the kind of gems that Justin-
590000	592000	See, Justin TV? He does kind of look like the Unabomber
592000	593000	Alright
593000	594000	What's on your mind?
594000	596000	Andrew, welcome to the show tonight
596000	598000	Oh, not much
598000	600000	You gotta get that mic like right there
600000	602000	It's now working right
602000	604000	It's a crazy mic
604000	607000	You're here to celebrate our sixth birthday with us, I'm sure
607000	608000	Of course
608000	611000	And your own anniversary is tomorrow, as in your birthday
611000	612000	Yeah
612000	613000	How old are you going to be tomorrow?
613000	615000	Appropriately, I'm going to be 23
615000	618000	Wow, ah, oh my gosh, there's that number of coincidence again
618000	620000	That got brought up on Bobby's show earlier
620000	621000	Oops
621000	622000	Wow
622000	624000	That means you were 17 when this show started?
624000	625000	Yes, I was
625000	627000	God, I'm old
627000	629000	God, I am old, alright
629000	631000	Let's talk about My Gaming Week
631000	633000	We'll get back to Andrew later, you can talk about his
633000	637000	My Gaming Week, I played Warcraft because I'm addicted
637000	639000	And some other stuff too
639000	641000	I got into very randomly
641000	643000	Like, got back into playing Guitar Hero 3
643000	647000	I don't even remember why, but I just started, like, hacking at it again
647000	650000	And some of those songs that were really holding me back
650000	653000	Like, Knights of Sedonia was a song on hard
653000	655000	I was having a hard time beating
655000	658000	Yeah, I'm still on the hard difficulty, I can't play expert yet
658000	662000	Because there's these triplets in hard mode that are so difficult in that song
662000	665000	I had the hardest time getting past it, but finally I beat it this week
665000	667000	And then I started playing some other songs too
667000	670000	And I even downloaded the Coldplay pack and the No Doubt pack
670000	672000	Because, I don't know, for some reason
672000	675000	I enjoy playing Guitar Hero more than I enjoy playing Rock Band
675000	676000	Which I know is weird
676000	678000	Because you would think, like, Rock Band's kind of the better game
678000	680000	And in a lot of ways it is
680000	682000	But since I don't really like to play drums
682000	684000	And I'm not going to sing in my house
684000	686000	Like, especially when nobody's around
686000	688000	It's kind of like a party where I can use alcohol as an excuse
688000	692000	It's, I don't know, there's nothing to play but guitar
692000	694000	And I kind of like the guitar parts in Guitar Hero
694000	696000	Better than I do Rock Band
696000	697000	Rock Band gets kind of boring
697000	699000	Because, I don't know, it's a little closer to the real thing or something
699000	700000	I don't know
700000	703000	But Guitar Hero gets all crazy and I like that
703000	708000	So, Rapid Slasher and Chat Room
708000	710000	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com agrees
710000	712000	That section on Sedonia is tough
712000	714000	It is tough
714000	715000	There it is
715000	717000	Cheeseburger in Chat says
717000	719000	Hey Rob, I was 7 when the show started
719000	721000	Because he's 13 now, my god
721000	723000	I'm old
723000	725000	I thought he was listening to the show at 7
725000	727000	I don't think he was actually listening when he was 7
727000	729000	I think he just said he was
729000	731000	Happened to be 7
731000	733000	Joshie16 in Chat says
733000	734000	Guitar Hero is more fun alone
734000	735000	Yeah, I kind of agree
735000	737000	Guitar Hero may not be the better party game
737000	738000	But it's more fun to play by yourself
738000	740000	So, go figure
740000	742000	Alright, also in my gaming week
742000	745000	I bought Space Invaders Extreme for the PSP
745000	747000	Because I had played a little bit
747000	749000	When Loki had it over here
749000	750000	I don't know, whatever
750000	752000	He had it on his PSP a while ago
752000	753000	And I played it and I kind of liked it
753000	755000	I was like, hey, it's like Space Invaders mixed with Rez
755000	756000	And it was kind of cool
756000	758000	So I decided I was going to get it
758000	760000	Although, I don't know, it's not really like mixed with Rez
760000	762000	It just has that same like, upbeat music
762000	766000	And it kind of feels like a game that would have been made by Q Entertainment
766000	767000	But it's not
767000	769000	My only kind of complaint about the game
769000	771000	I mean, they made Space Invaders a heck of a lot of fun
771000	773000	I mean, not only do you have
773000	774000	You know Space Invaders
774000	775000	Who doesn't know that game by now
775000	776000	But now
776000	779000	Like, not only is it flashy with the graphics in the background
779000	781000	But the invaders come in little colors
781000	782000	And you have some red ones
782000	783000	Some green ones
783000	784000	And some blue ones
784000	785000	And if you shoot four blue ones in a row
785000	786000	You get one type of weapon
786000	787000	You shoot red ones in a row
787000	788000	You get another
788000	789000	And so on
789000	791000	So that's kind of like a challenge-y element to it
791000	792000	If you want the good weapon
792000	794000	So it's like a cross between Space Invaders
794000	797000	And Raven
797000	799000	Yeah, I guess, yeah
799000	800000	It's kind of different
800000	802000	But the only thing that kind of disappointed me
802000	804000	Now granted, I haven't played the game a whole lot
804000	805000	Or gotten very far
805000	808000	So it's probably not fair for me to say a whole lot about it right now
808000	811000	But, I mean, I've played far enough where I've started to notice this
811000	814000	I don't notice a lot really change from level to level
814000	816000	I mean, yeah, the aliens get smarter
816000	818000	You start to fight these, like, massive aliens
818000	820000	And one of the coolest things, I think, in the game is the bosses
820000	822000	Like, they actually have boss aliens they have to fight
822000	823000	Which is kind of cool
823000	825000	And, you know, then you have the little miniature aliens
825000	828000	But it's still always blue, red, green aliens
828000	831000	And the same weapon upgrades that you had in level one
831000	834000	So I was just kind of hoping maybe some of that would change and upgrade as the game goes on
834000	836000	If it does, I haven't gotten there yet
836000	839000	And I've gotten to the point where it's starting to feel a little stale
839000	840000	So, you know
840000	843000	You know, because the original Space Invaders was all white or green aliens
843000	847000	It's been 30 fucking years since the original Space Invaders
847000	848000	It ain't broke
848000	854000	Well, but would you spend $20 to buy the original Space Invaders
854000	857000	Which I think most of us now play as, you know
857000	860000	Oh, we downloaded the ROM in two seconds to play on MAME
860000	862000	And we fire it up one time and go
862000	864000	Oh, yeah, this game, oh, this is fun
864000	865000	Ah, next game
865000	866000	Pretty much
866000	870000	How many people actually sit there and play old school Space Invaders for, like, three hours
870000	872000	Like they did back in the 80s
872000	873000	Um
873000	874000	Really?
874000	875000	Really?
875000	876000	When?
876000	877000	About two years ago
877000	878000	Wow
878000	879000	Why?
879000	880000	Were you trying to, like, break it?
880000	881000	You know, okay
881000	883000	I take a little bit of it back because
883000	887000	I've even found myself on GameTap going back to old Atari 2600 games
887000	889000	That were boring years ago, like Kaboom
889000	892000	And I frickin' played Kaboom for, like, an hour and a half
892000	893000	Just a couple weeks ago
893000	895000	So I could, I guess I could see that
895000	898000	I was trying to break my old record, though
898000	899000	But let's face it
899000	902000	We used to be really, really good at Space Invaders
902000	904000	Let's face it, we're a little weird
904000	907000	You should watch King Kong, watch the guy play Crystal Castles with his feet
907000	909000	I guess that's true
909000	911000	Do you have any interest, then I want to ask you
911000	913000	Do you have any interest in newer Space Invaders?
913000	915000	Or is it like, oh no, this is bastardizing a classic?
915000	916000	I would try it
916000	917000	Alright
917000	918000	I mean, I'm open to anything
918000	920000	The new Frogger made me want to throw up
920000	921000	But I'll give Space Invaders a try
921000	922000	The one on Xbox Live?
922000	923000	No
923000	924000	That Frogger 2?
924000	925000	Oh
925000	926000	No, no, the old new Frogger
926000	927000	The old new Frogger
927000	928000	Oh, okay
928000	929000	Wanna be 3D Frogger?
929000	930000	It made me want to throw up
930000	933000	I downloaded Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, by the way
933000	934000	The, um
934000	936000	The, uh, revamped version
936000	937000	Um
937000	938000	I don't think it was based on PlayStation 2
938000	939000	I think it's original
939000	940000	Or a PlayStation game
940000	941000	I think it's an original game
941000	942000	Um
942000	943000	It's
943000	944000	There was a Frogger 2, though
944000	945000	It's so cute
945000	946000	You want to throw up in your mouth
946000	949000	But the little hoppy noise gets really irritating
949000	950000	But I only played the demo
950000	951000	I didn't actually buy the full game
951000	952000	So
952000	954000	Anyway, that's pretty much it for my gaming week
954000	955000	Space Invaders
955000	956000	Which is pretty cool
956000	957000	I mean, for 20 bucks
957000	958000	It's pretty hard to beat
958000	959000	It's a good priced game
959000	960000	And, uh
960000	961000	It's a
961000	963000	You know, PSP games are not games you'd usually
963000	965000	I mean, unless you're playing Crisis Core or something
965000	967000	Not something you spend hours and hours and hours doing
967000	968000	I prefer playing the PSP
968000	971000	While I'm waiting at the airport for my plane
971000	974000	Or while I'm waiting for something, you know, better to happen in my real life
974000	976000	So Space Invaders is a good short attention span game
976000	977000	I tried playing Crisis Core
977000	979000	That game bores me
979000	980000	Really?
980000	981000	Yeah
981000	983000	With all the praise and things it's gotten?
983000	984000	It's boring
984000	985000	I don't know
985000	986000	I tried playing it twice
986000	987000	Now, I've
987000	988000	I played it for a good long
988000	990000	You know, two hour session
990000	992000	Was it, uh, a while ago
992000	993000	When it first came out
993000	994000	And then I played it
994000	995000	Some more
995000	996000	Like the end of April
996000	998000	During the plane flight
998000	999000	And
999000	1001000	I just couldn't get into it
1001000	1002000	It was so boring
1002000	1004000	It's just because I think you
1004000	1006000	Kind of start off at that, like, hub there
1006000	1009000	And you have little places that you can explore
1009000	1012000	But it doesn't really feel like an actual fancy game
1012000	1013000	It just feels like
1013000	1014000	Do mission
1014000	1015000	Fight people
1015000	1016000	Go back to the hub
1016000	1017000	Do mission
1017000	1018000	Fight people
1018000	1019000	Go back
1019000	1020000	I don't know
1020000	1021000	It's just very boring for me
1021000	1022000	Okay, I gotta go to chatroom
1022000	1023000	Because they're talking about
1023000	1025000	A lot about Space Invaders here
1025000	1027000	Um, GS68 says from Wikipedia
1027000	1029000	Space Invaders was a very popular video game
1029000	1031000	That influenced the video game industry
1031000	1033000	In Japan, specialty arcades opened with
1033000	1035000	Nothing but Space Invaders cabinets
1035000	1036000	The game is considered one of the most
1036000	1038000	Successful arcade shooting games
1038000	1039000	Uh, you know, so
1039000	1040000	We all know that
1040000	1042000	People went crazy about the game in Japan
1042000	1043000	We know that
1043000	1045000	Um, it was much bigger over there
1045000	1046000	Than it was over here
1046000	1047000	And the Kitsune in chat says
1047000	1049000	You see Space Invaders everywhere here
1049000	1051000	They even have Space Invaders plushies in the arcade
1051000	1052000	That you can win
1052000	1053000	That might be kind of cute actually
1053000	1054000	I had Space Invader
1054000	1055000	Um, cell phone charm
1055000	1056000	For a while
1056000	1057000	Now the original Space Invaders
1057000	1058000	Can be kind of boring
1058000	1060000	Continues Kitsune in our chatroom
1060000	1061000	But I played a newer version
1061000	1062000	I loved it
1062000	1064000	And yeah, I, I, I enjoyed
1064000	1066000	Space Invaders Extreme
1066000	1068000	Which is a tiny bit stale
1068000	1069000	But that's okay, it's a good
1069000	1070000	Short attention span game
1070000	1071000	Kind of like the Gradius collection
1071000	1072000	I don't sit there and play Gradius
1072000	1074000	For hours and hours either
1074000	1075000	Shooters in general
1075000	1076000	No comment
1076000	1077000	Huh?
1077000	1078000	No comment
1078000	1079000	Shooters in general to me
1079000	1080000	Are short attention span games
1080000	1081000	That's just the way I play
1081000	1082000	I would like a new Gradius game
1082000	1083000	That was actually really kickass
1083000	1084000	You know, cause I mean
1084000	1086000	Gradius 5 was alright
1086000	1087000	It was pretty cool
1087000	1089000	But something really like
1089000	1091000	Oomph, like awesome
1091000	1092000	You need a, somehow like
1092000	1094000	The universe needs to collide
1094000	1095000	A certain way
1095000	1096000	And Itagaki needs to do
1096000	1097000	Gradius 6, right?
1097000	1100000	There wouldn't be a ship
1100000	1101000	It'd just be him there
1101000	1102000	Just like
1102000	1104000	Kicking people over and stuff
1104000	1105000	Alright
1105000	1106000	Putting out cigarettes
1106000	1108000	On like other ships or something
1108000	1109000	Let me go over to Miklotov
1109000	1110000	Who's reading a book
1110000	1111000	During our show
1111000	1112000	I guess we're that exciting
1112000	1114000	Miklotov, do you have anything
1114000	1115000	You want to say about
1115000	1116000	Your gaming week
1116000	1117000	Not our gaming week
1117000	1118000	But yours
1118000	1119000	My book is good
1119000	1120000	I don't know what you're talking about
1120000	1121000	First of all
1121000	1123000	Secondly, all I do is play WoW
1123000	1125000	Or I play DJ Max on my PSP
1125000	1126000	So
1126000	1127000	You need to play DS games
1127000	1129000	I have a DS with a bunch of games on it
1129000	1130000	Including imports
1130000	1131000	You will play
1131000	1133000	I play Oh And On 2
1133000	1134000	And Phoenix Wright games
1134000	1135000	And that's about it
1135000	1136000	And Professor Layton
1136000	1137000	Well I have Oh And On 2 on here
1137000	1139000	I have that with me
1139000	1140000	But it's not my book
1140000	1141000	And Band Brothers
1141000	1142000	I have Band Brothers
1142000	1143000	Band Brothers is a fun game
1143000	1145000	Tell our listeners about DJ Max
1145000	1146000	And some of the things you enjoy about it
1146000	1147000	It's better than Beatmania
1147000	1148000	We have some listeners that really love it
1148000	1150000	It's way better than Beatmania
1150000	1151000	Why
1151000	1152000	Because it's fun
1152000	1154000	And it's not insanely stupid sometimes
1154000	1156000	Unlike Beatmania
1156000	1159000	Which is insanely stupid most of the time
1159000	1163000	And it's easy to pick up and go
1163000	1165000	And the songs are better
1165000	1167000	And it's Korean
1167000	1170000	So it's better because of that
1170000	1171000	So in other words
1171000	1172000	If you can't sense
1172000	1174000	Mikolatov's insane bias
1174000	1176000	For Korean based music
1176000	1177000	And Korean things
1177000	1178000	Because he likes Pump It Up a lot too
1178000	1179000	Yeah Pump It Up is better than DDR
1179000	1181000	Yeah see if you can't sense his extreme bias
1181000	1182000	For all things Korean
1182000	1184000	Then take what he says with the Korean stuff
1184000	1187000	How about Tycho No Tatrogen DS
1187000	1188000	I've not played that
1188000	1189000	It didn't look good
1189000	1190000	I don't like the one in the arcade
1190000	1192000	And I didn't like the one on the Playstation
1192000	1194000	So I don't think I like the one on the DS
1194000	1195000	But yeah DJ Max is cool
1195000	1197000	Because you can customize like
1197000	1198000	Everything in it
1198000	1199000	And it's fun
1199000	1200000	It's got stupid videos
1200000	1203000	Yeah I like the one video with the Power Rangers
1203000	1205000	Smashing the girls' flowers
1205000	1206000	The MB Rangers are cool
1206000	1207000	Is that what it was called?
1207000	1208000	The MB Rangers?
1208000	1209000	Yeah
1209000	1210000	Funny
1210000	1211000	That's it
1211000	1212000	Back to book
1212000	1214000	I like Burning Rangers
1214000	1217000	Andrew how was your gaming week?
1217000	1219000	Well I could talk about other games
1219000	1221000	That are good for 20 bucks
1221000	1223000	Like Hellgate London
1223000	1226000	Which looks like it's finally out of beta
1226000	1228000	What six months after release
1228000	1230000	They're working on a 2.0 patch
1230000	1232000	It's an okay Diablo 2 clone
1232000	1235000	But it could be better
1235000	1237000	It could be way way better
1237000	1239000	Other than that I've been enjoying the free weekend
1239000	1241000	Of Team Fortress 2
1241000	1244000	And getting in a little day of defeat
1244000	1246000	Not much else really
1246000	1249000	Recently got Brawl and unlocked everything
1249000	1251000	Within nine hours of opening the box
1251000	1254000	Wow that's dedication
1254000	1257000	Still haven't got all the achievements though
1257000	1259000	Still a lot of stuff to do
1259000	1261000	People need to register me
1261000	1263000	For Brawl by the way
1263000	1264000	It's getting a lot of-
1264000	1266000	Do you know your friend code off the top of your head?
1266000	1267000	Off the top of my head? No
1267000	1268000	Thank you Nintendo
1268000	1270000	I'm not that dedicated
1270000	1272000	Just go to the forums
1272000	1273000	I'm there
1273000	1274000	Look at it
1274000	1275000	Nice plug
1275000	1277000	Over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
1277000	1278000	Click on the forums
1278000	1279000	Thank you
1279000	1280000	Anything else you've been playing this week?
1280000	1281000	Oh that's about it
1281000	1283000	Besides Brawl and Hellgate
1283000	1284000	Nothing else
1284000	1287000	DJ Ratchet in chat says
1287000	1288000	And again if you want to join our chat room
1288000	1290000	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
1290000	1291000	He says
1291000	1295000	I hope there will eventually be an Elite Beat Agents 2
1295000	1298000	As much as it pains me to say at fat chance
1298000	1300000	And Miklotov's agreeing
1300000	1301000	Why are you agreeing Miklotov?
1301000	1303000	Cause like
1303000	1304000	I think
1304000	1306000	Four people bought it?
1306000	1308000	I bought it, you bought it
1308000	1310000	Who else bought Elite Beat Agents?
1310000	1311000	That's it, no
1311000	1312000	That's two, there's half
1312000	1313000	Okay, Andrew bought
1313000	1315000	There's the four right there
1315000	1317000	Obviously it was more than four people that bought it
1317000	1319000	But the sad thing is you know like you go to Fry's
1319000	1321000	Which is a big electronics store here in California
1321000	1323000	There were tons and tons of them sitting in the discount bin
1323000	1325000	I think Nintendo just had higher hopes for the game
1325000	1327000	It just got so discounted so quick
1327000	1329000	Because like people saw the music list and were like
1329000	1330000	Oh it's crappy
1330000	1332000	Well yeah the music normally would be crappy
1332000	1334000	But inside the game it was really good
1334000	1337000	September with the cutscenes made you feel epic
1337000	1339000	September that was the
1339000	1341000	That was the one about
1341000	1343000	And she makes the best hamburgers too
1343000	1345000	I love that one
1345000	1346000	That's a really good one
1346000	1348000	See and people just didn't give enough of a chance
1348000	1350000	It's not J-pop so why would they care
1350000	1351000	Elite Beat Agents
1351000	1355000	I can discount Elite Beat Agents on account of one song
1355000	1357000	And one song only
1357000	1359000	And that would be Canned Heat
1359000	1360000	It was a bad cover
1360000	1362000	But the story was hilarious
1362000	1364000	It was a bad cover of a good song with a great story
1364000	1366000	But it was offbeat
1366000	1369000	It was not so badly offbeat
1369000	1372000	Oh good job, good research Katamari's Forever
1372000	1374000	Says the actual number of copies sold
1374000	1376000	16,000 per VG charts
1376000	1378000	Wow
1378000	1380000	That's practically 4
1380000	1382000	I mean when you consider that there's a lot of crappy games
1382000	1384000	That sell way more than that
1384000	1385000	It's kind of sad
1385000	1388000	Yeah but 16,000 that's not much bigger than 4
1388000	1390000	It's really not
1390000	1391000	Not in the scope of things
1391000	1392000	Not for a video game
1392000	1394000	It's 4 times 4,000
1394000	1396000	Yeah I was close
1396000	1397000	I had one number right
1397000	1399000	Alright
1399000	1403000	Plus Elite Beat Agents can kind of make you cry
1403000	1405000	You know because it has the sad stage
1405000	1406000	There's always the sad stage
1406000	1408000	Which one had the chris
1408000	1409000	There was the Christmas one
1409000	1410000	You're the Inspiration
1410000	1412000	That's the one for that game
1412000	1415000	All the sad stages are sad except for Oh and Don 1
1415000	1416000	That one wasn't so sad
1416000	1417000	But DJ Ratchet's right
1417000	1419000	You're the Inspiration had some hilarious screw up scenes
1419000	1420000	It really does
1420000	1421000	Yes
1421000	1423000	Like when you see the dad in like a speedo
1423000	1425000	That cracked me up
1425000	1429000	The only thing that was more epic than say September in Oh and Don
1429000	1434000	Would be doing Ready Steady Go saving the world from a giant meteor
1434000	1438000	That was so epic it was hilarious
1438000	1440000	I like Oh and Don 2's epic stage
1440000	1441000	It was cooler
1441000	1442000	I don't even remember what happens
1442000	1444000	But I just remember I liked the song better
1444000	1446000	And it was more fun to play
1446000	1448000	By the way spoilers for a music game
1450000	1451000	That's alright
1451000	1455000	I was just realizing is it really 16,000 or is it 160,000
1455000	1457000	It can't be 16,000
1457000	1458000	There's no way
1458000	1459000	Let me look hold on
1459000	1460000	It has to be 160
1460000	1461000	I'm going to look
1461000	1462000	America
1462000	1463000	I'll find the answer
1463000	1466000	While we get into other stuff throughout the show
1466000	1468000	If it is 16,000
1468000	1469000	Yeah there's a reason right there
1469000	1470000	Why we'll never get one
1470000	1471000	Cause I'm thinking like
1471000	1474000	God I have Judgement sold more than that game
1475000	1476000	That's sad
1477000	1478000	Alright
1478000	1480000	Housekeeping tonight
1480000	1483000	Tonight is our sixth anniversary show
1484000	1485000	Yay
1485000	1486000	Orange launch
1486000	1487000	Can I get a yay
1487000	1488000	Yay
1488000	1489000	Alright
1489000	1491000	Orange launch radio started on June 23, 2008
1491000	1493000	And it was about as exciting as this episode
1495000	1498000	Allgames.com relaunched this week

1525000	1527000	Come listen to a new show

1530000	1532000	Thanks to me going back
1532000	1534000	And playing Guitar Hero 3 this week
1534000	1535000	I actually thought to check
1535000	1537000	On the Guitar Hero OL Army
1537000	1538000	And I had to go back
1538000	1539000	And approve requests to join
1539000	1541000	From like February
1542000	1545000	So if I neglected to add you to the OL Army
1545000	1546000	You're there now
1546000	1547000	And if you want to join the OL Army
1547000	1549000	Go to the Guitar Hero community site
1549000	1551000	And search for OLRMY
1551000	1553000	And you too can join our Guitar Hero OL Army
1553000	1555000	Which I promise I will update more than once
1555000	1556000	Every four months
1556000	1559000	Also if you missed it in part B last week
1559000	1561000	We had a pretty cool announcement
1561000	1562000	Joining us next week on the program
1562000	1564000	Tommy Tallarico will be here
1564000	1565000	For an extended interview
1565000	1568000	Where he's going to talk about video games live
1568000	1570000	And his involvement with GANG
1570000	1572000	Which is a big audio guild
1572000	1576000	For people that are into making audio for games
1576000	1577000	Whether they're already doing it
1577000	1578000	Or just have an interest in it
1578000	1580000	And more video games live
1580000	1581000	Because it's what lots of people
1581000	1582000	Are talking about right now
1582000	1583000	Tommy's going to be here to join us
1583000	1584000	Talk a lot about that
1584000	1585000	It's pretty cool
1585000	1587000	I'll be next week here on Orange Lounge Radio
1587000	1588000	But for tonight
1588000	1589000	Since this is the sixth anniversary
1589000	1590000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
1590000	1592000	We do have some special things planned
1592000	1593000	For you in part B
1593000	1594000	We're going to bring back
1594000	1595000	These segments
1595000	1597000	From OLR's history
1597000	1600000	And one of them is going to be music game related
1600000	1603000	We're going to do a list list in part B tonight
1603000	1605000	And it does have to do with music games
1605000	1606000	So that'll be pretty exciting
1606000	1608000	Especially for our long time listeners
1608000	1609000	Who remember our roots
1609000	1610000	For now though
1610000	1613000	Gaming news throughout the gaming world
1613000	1614000	We'll start it off with Loki
1614000	1617000	Yes, this week we had a brand new firmware update
1617000	1619000	For the PSP
1619000	1621000	And it didn't really add a whole lot
1621000	1624000	Except for the ability to search on Google
1624000	1626000	Straight from the cross media bar
1626000	1631000	And also the other thing that they added along with that
1631000	1634000	Was now that you can change the viewing speed
1634000	1635000	During video playback
1635000	1637000	By pressing the up and down buttons
1637000	1639000	While you're watching a video
1639000	1642000	Yay
1642000	1645000	And I'm sure they also tried to fix some other holes
1645000	1647000	That were opened up
1647000	1650000	Allowing people to run homebrew and stuff
1650000	1654000	And I know that they're already working on custom firmware 4.0
1654000	1656000	So
1656000	1658000	Yeah
1658000	1662000	That doesn't work
1662000	1665000	Why is it that they're calling it 4.0?
1665000	1668000	Probably because they had so many updates
1668000	1670000	That were getting close to 4.0 anyways
1670000	1672000	It's like 3.96 and stuff
1672000	1674000	Might as well just go 4.0
1674000	1677000	Because I guess they would consider the internet search function
1677000	1680000	As a brand new feature or something like that
1680000	1682000	Instead of just a little update
1682000	1684000	So
1684000	1687000	I don't know, I think they're just running out of numbers
1687000	1689000	Okay
1689000	1692000	Going back to Elite Beat Agents for a minute
1692000	1695000	Because this news about the 4.0 firmware kind of bores me
1695000	1697000	Because they really didn't do much to call this 4.0
1697000	1699000	I was expecting something a little more landmark
1699000	1701000	Going back to Elite Beat Agents
1701000	1704000	It actually sold.17 million
1704000	1707000	Which would be 170,000 copies
1707000	1708000	Not 16,000
1708000	1710000	That must have been just in the first week or something
1710000	1712000	Yay, that's still not enough to get another game
1712000	1715000	And that's also still not as much as
1715000	1717000	Eye of Judgment, right?
1717000	1719000	But that is only released though in two regions though
1719000	1721000	So you have to also count
1721000	1723000	Whatever
1723000	1725000	Owen Dunn
1725000	1727000	Eye of Judgment has sold.21 million copies
1727000	1729000	Granted, that's worldwide
1729000	1732000	It didn't sell better than Crysis
1732000	1734000	Let's see
1734000	1736000	Comparing it to some other games
1736000	1739000	Let's see, Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses
1739000	1741000	Oh, we don't have sales data for that
1741000	1743000	Let's see, what are some of these other ones?
1743000	1745000	Maybe I can find
1745000	1746000	Ah, there we go
1746000	1748000	Barbie Island Princess on the DS
1748000	1750000	.14 million copies
1750000	1752000	That's only 30,000 less than Owen Dunn
1752000	1754000	How about Elite Beat Agents?
1754000	1756000	Let's Ride Friends Forever
1756000	1758000	Let's Ride Friends Forever
1758000	1760000	Let's Ride Friends Forever
1760000	1762000	Not in the database
1762000	1764000	Awesome, it's so crappy it's not even there
1764000	1766000	What about Imagine Babies?
1766000	1768000	Oh wait, I found Let's Ride Friends Forever
1768000	1770000	Imagine Babies? You'd be surprised
1770000	1772000	It's actually in the top selling
1772000	1774000	DS titles
1774000	1776000	I honestly don't understand
1776000	1778000	Wow, wow, wow, get this
1778000	1780000	Do you know how many copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever
1780000	1782000	sold in its first week of release?
1782000	1784000	No
1784000	1786000	986
1786000	1788000	Ok, I'm sorry
1788000	1790000	So yeah, you're about
1790000	1792000	What is it?
1792000	1794000	200 or
1794000	1796000	211,000
1796000	1798000	copies now of Eye Judgment
1798000	1800000	Ok, wow
1800000	1802000	Wow
1802000	1804000	Ok, thank god
1804000	1806000	I'm sorry
1806000	1808000	Elite Beat Agents
1808000	1810000	170,000 copies, right?
1810000	1812000	Imagine Babies, you ready for this?
1812000	1814000	1.85 million copies
1814000	1816000	have sold
1816000	1818000	That's per VGCharts.com
1818000	1820000	That makes sense though
1820000	1822000	It's seriously, it's weird
1822000	1824000	People buy it for their little girls
1824000	1826000	Cause they want them to know how to raise their babies
1826000	1828000	It's absolutely weird, that game right there
1828000	1830000	is like, seriously up in the top
1830000	1832000	of the DS charts and also
1832000	1834000	Imagine Fashion Designer is up there too
1834000	1836000	Ok, iVal
1836000	1838000	Since I own the game thanks to somebody
1838000	1840000	in this room
1840000	1842000	I'm going to play Imagine Babies
1842000	1844000	this week
1844000	1846000	Come back and report on it
1846000	1848000	You better be good on it
1848000	1850000	Also, Breaking a Million copies sold
1850000	1852000	Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Happy Cooking
1852000	1854000	How many did Cookie Mama sell?
1854000	1856000	Last one
1856000	1858000	Cookie Mama
1858000	1860000	Elite Beat Agents sold 170,000
1860000	1862000	Cookie Mama sold 2.74 million copies
1862000	1864000	What about Cookie Mama 2? Cause I don't think that did as well
1864000	1866000	Cookie Mama 2
1866000	1868000	1.19 million, keep in mind these are worldwide numbers
1868000	1870000	Crazy
1870000	1872000	Alright, I'm done
1872000	1874000	Thank god I wasn't like
1874000	1876000	Imagine Babies, no one will buy that
1876000	1878000	Let's just add that to the thing
1878000	1880000	Yeah, see, I'm smart
1880000	1882000	You are very smart
1882000	1884000	It's a good thing you didn't take that as part of the bet
1884000	1886000	Alright, let's see
1886000	1890000	Sony planning a clamp down on PSP
1890000	1892000	Pirating
1892000	1894000	That's right, there is a piracy problem
1894000	1896000	on the PSP
1896000	1898000	said Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe
1898000	1900000	President David Reeves
1900000	1902000	And we know about it
1902000	1904000	We know how it's done
1904000	1906000	So basically they know how to
1906000	1908000	log on to any of the many blogs out there
1908000	1910000	that specifically talk about PSP hacking
1910000	1912000	Right, they're gonna really clamp down on PSP piracy
1912000	1914000	These were quotes from
1914000	1916000	Sony's Devastation
1916000	1918000	Developer Conference
1918000	1920000	that was held in London
1920000	1922000	And it's not all bad news
1922000	1924000	because
1924000	1926000	sometimes piracy, says
1926000	1928000	David Reeves,
1928000	1930000	fuels the growth of hardware sales
1930000	1932000	So people
1932000	1934000	buy PSP, and you know what, I actually kind of see that
1934000	1936000	because a lot of people bought the PSP
1936000	1938000	when they found out that they were able to
1938000	1940000	play NES games on them
1940000	1942000	It's kind of true
1942000	1944000	I know a lot of people that when they first got them, that's all they did
1944000	1946000	They had me put emulators on there for them
1946000	1948000	and they played NES games
1948000	1950000	One of my friends went right out and bought one and then modded his battery
1950000	1952000	Here's one thing to
1952000	1954000	note though, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up
1954000	1956000	He went on to say that
1956000	1958000	there are plans going on
1958000	1960000	that will crack down on the numbers
1960000	1962000	of pirates out there, but
1962000	1964000	There is nothing they can do, absolutely
1964000	1966000	nothing, they have said this forever
1966000	1968000	and they have tried different methods
1968000	1970000	and it's slowed people down
1970000	1972000	but then eventually they come back around
1972000	1974000	and they find a new way about it
1974000	1976000	You have no chance, make your time
1976000	1978000	It's just like
1978000	1980000	we're gonna get to another story about another system later
1980000	1982000	and the same damn thing is going on there
1982000	1984000	It's ridiculous
1984000	1986000	People, I wish they would learn
1986000	1988000	there is nothing they can do
1988000	1990000	because as soon as they make
1990000	1992000	more of a bigger deal about it
1992000	1994000	that's when people start finding out about it
1994000	1996000	and then they start, oh hey I can do that now
1996000	1998000	I didn't know
2002000	2004000	When was the last time that you heard about
2004000	2006000	hacking being done on the Playstation 3?
2006000	2008000	I've heard of them
2008000	2010000	actually trying things
2010000	2012000	but they still haven't gotten anything to work yet
2012000	2014000	If I'm not mistaken, Playstation 3 has a more
2014000	2016000	don't give a shit attitude towards like
2016000	2018000	installing Linux on it and all that stuff
2018000	2020000	That's why people don't care
2020000	2022000	People are looking
2022000	2024000	to find ways to run homebrew stuff
2024000	2026000	on it, I think mainly
2026000	2028000	they're trying to find ways to pirate stuff
2028000	2030000	but even stuff, even let's just say
2030000	2032000	you were able to pirate games on the PS3
2032000	2034000	it's not really
2034000	2036000	as easy because
2036000	2038000	if you dump a Playstation 3 game
2038000	2040000	that's upwards to 50 gigs
2040000	2042000	you're only going to be able to
2042000	2044000	throw one or two on your hard drive
2044000	2046000	at a time
2046000	2048000	it's just more cumbersome
2048000	2050000	just say forget it
2050000	2052000	and they'll do it on the 360 instead
2052000	2054000	Before we get to our next story
2054000	2056000	a comment from chat, Amaze Satsuma in chat
2056000	2058000	says there is one way to stop pirates
2058000	2060000	send ninjas out to kill them
2060000	2062000	There you have it
2062000	2064000	But you know what though
2064000	2066000	there are ninjas that are
2066000	2068000	you know, acting in
2068000	2070000	they're participating in
2070000	2072000	piracy actually, there's the Wii Ninja
2072000	2074000	which is a mod chip
2074000	2076000	for the Wii that allows you to play pirated games
2076000	2078000	Sairan
2078000	2080000	in chat says what is a pirate
2080000	2082000	a miserable little pile of hacks
2082000	2084000	but enough talk
2084000	2086000	have at you
2086000	2088000	please save us from this
2088000	2090000	nonsense in our chat room
2090000	2092000	while we get to another story
2092000	2094000	Rob, you killed it
2094000	2096000	Hey, I didn't say it, Sairan said it
2096000	2098000	Do I gotta?
2098000	2100000	Well, some news about the MMO that
2100000	2102000	BioWare is
2102000	2104000	squirting out
2104000	2106000	they said that it's supposed to be out
2106000	2108000	between April 2010 and
2108000	2110000	April 2011
2110000	2112000	um
2112000	2114000	well
2114000	2116000	the article actually said
2116000	2118000	that EA was funding an MMO
2118000	2120000	but EA owns BioWare
2120000	2122000	and it's in Austin
2122000	2124000	so that's where they got the information from
2124000	2126000	and um
2126000	2128000	there's no more uh
2128000	2130000	information exactly about what it's gonna be
2130000	2132000	but the theory is Knights of the Old Republic
2132000	2134000	so
2134000	2136000	hmm
2136000	2138000	possible
2138000	2140000	hmm, that could be interesting
2140000	2142000	hmm, you say
2142000	2144000	anyways
2144000	2146000	there's gonna be some pretty interesting
2146000	2148000	stuff coming out about Resistance 2
2148000	2150000	of course just recently they had some gameplay
2150000	2152000	videos that were premiering on
2152000	2154000	GameTrailersTV and
2154000	2156000	now GamePro has
2156000	2158000	the scoop on some more stuff including
2158000	2160000	they're gonna be giving out
2160000	2162000	in random issues of GamePro
2162000	2164000	free Resistance 2 beta codes
2164000	2166000	so you'll be able to get in on
2166000	2168000	the beta for that and they're hoping to sell
2168000	2170000	a few more magazines with that as well cause
2170000	2172000	I don't know about you but I don't think GamePro's
2172000	2174000	doing that great right now. And there's some people
2174000	2176000	out there that would buy like 10 copies to get a
2176000	2178000	golden ticket quote unquote right? Yeah pretty
2178000	2180000	much. Did they say about how many of the magazines
2180000	2182000	are gonna have this? Nope.
2182000	2184000	Interesting. But they were saying that
2184000	2186000	there's tons of juicy
2186000	2188000	stuff in there and they're saying
2188000	2190000	it's bigger than Halo
2190000	2192000	bigger than Call of Duty
2192000	2194000	I'm sorry though or you know
2194000	2196000	better than Halo they said
2196000	2198000	a lot of things are better than Halo
2198000	2200000	unfortunately
2200000	2202000	but Resistance 2
2202000	2204000	is gonna be awesome. Resistance 1 was
2204000	2206000	absolutely cool. If you loved
2206000	2208000	Call of Duty and you want more of a
2208000	2210000	sci-fi game this is perfect
2210000	2212000	for you.
2212000	2214000	Of course and I don't think it made tonight's show
2214000	2216000	roll but I want to say something I read something about
2216000	2218000	Call of Duty 6 is supposed to be like sci-fi
2218000	2220000	related. Is that a response
2220000	2222000	to this? No I would think
2222000	2224000	they're just getting
2224000	2226000	they're trying to mix it up a bit but
2226000	2228000	you know I don't know if that
2228000	2230000	worked really well for Battlefield
2230000	2232000	2142 either though because
2232000	2234000	they tried to mix it up a bit and go a little sci-fi
2234000	2236000	and futuristic you know
2236000	2238000	Tom Clancy's been doing that or
2238000	2240000	the Tom Clancy series I guess
2240000	2242000	you know with Hawks and
2242000	2244000	End War and that kind of stuff but
2244000	2246000	you know I honestly
2246000	2248000	think that Resistance 2 is gonna be awesome. Resistance
2248000	2250000	I absolutely out of the first person shooters I've played
2250000	2252000	Gears of War, Halo 3
2252000	2254000	just
2254000	2256000	a lot of them out there
2256000	2258000	Resistance was my favorite
2258000	2260000	absolutely which is weird because you know
2260000	2262000	usually I'm not too favorable on
2262000	2264000	stuff for the Playstation 3
2264000	2266000	but you know it honestly is a good game
2266000	2268000	and I'm definitely buying the next one
2268000	2270000	Alright
2270000	2272000	I'm just kinda reading
2272000	2274000	some other crazy stuff in chat
2274000	2276000	DJ Ratchet speculates
2276000	2278000	it ends up only 5 game pros have it
2278000	2280000	so it actually does turn into
2280000	2282000	Willy Wonka. Well they're assuming that's gonna be over
2282000	2284000	60 since they're
2284000	2286000	obviously gonna be stress testing
2286000	2288000	servers so you know
2288000	2290000	there's gonna be 60 player online with
2290000	2292000	Resistance 2. Will there be more
2292000	2294000	Resistance 2 beta keys than
2294000	2296000	copies of Elite Beat Agents sold?
2296000	2298000	I don't think so.
2298000	2300000	Alright I promise no more
2300000	2302000	sales figures but I lied
2302000	2304000	cause this is actually something a little more current
2304000	2306000	Metal Gear Solid 4 should be noted
2306000	2308000	that Fumitsu Magazine has
2308000	2310000	reported that over in Japan
2310000	2312000	since Fumitsu Magazine is in Japan
2312000	2314000	476,334
2314000	2316000	copies were sold
2316000	2318000	in the first week
2318000	2320000	and
2320000	2322000	by the way 77,208
2322000	2324000	consoles
2324000	2326000	were sold that week and that is
2326000	2328000	like if you kinda do the math there that's
2328000	2330000	what about like 1 in 4
2330000	2332000	no 1 in 5?
2332000	2334000	so like 1 out of every 5
2334000	2336000	copies of the game sold also
2336000	2338000	pushed a console. That's pretty
2338000	2340000	big. There you have it
2340000	2342000	over in the UK
2342000	2344000	cause 1 out of every 5
2344000	2346000	copies was probably one of those
2346000	2348000	consoles that included the
2348000	2350000	game with it possibly
2350000	2352000	over in the UK it should be noted that
2352000	2354000	Metal Gear Solid 4 well it sold well it did not
2354000	2356000	do quite as well as Grand Theft Auto
2356000	2358000	4. It was 14,000
2358000	2360000	copies short
2360000	2362000	of the Metal Gear Solid 2 release
2362000	2364000	in 2002
2364000	2366000	See I have a bad feeling
2366000	2368000	that they're gonna start really
2368000	2370000	budging their numbers with
2370000	2372000	oh yeah look how many consoles this
2372000	2374000	game pushed. Well yeah because
2374000	2376000	you're including it with all the consoles. Of course
2376000	2378000	it's gonna be
2378000	2380000	kind of equal with
2380000	2382000	the console sales. You know
2382000	2384000	what though? We even know people that have
2384000	2386000	went out and bought a Playstation 3 just for this
2386000	2388000	game. Yeah I could believe it.
2388000	2390000	I mean it's an awesome game.
2390000	2392000	But then again when Final Fantasy 13 comes out
2392000	2394000	I will probably buy a Playstation 3 just
2394000	2396000	for that game so what can you do? Well don't worry
2396000	2398000	about that time you know the Playstation 4
2398000	2400000	will be coming out so. Hurray!
2400000	2402000	Plus maybe Sony
2402000	2404000	Home I'll actually have to play as well
2404000	2406000	Yeah I'm sure it'll eventually be
2406000	2408000	out in beta form of course.
2408000	2410000	Well
2410000	2412000	for other news if
2412000	2414000	anyone's been interested
2414000	2416000	in LittleBigPlanet
2416000	2418000	the Sony experience is coming
2418000	2420000	by on a bunch of trucks
2420000	2422000	that has different kiosks
2422000	2424000	with games in it such as
2424000	2426000	Turismo 5 Prologue, Metal Gear Solid 4
2426000	2428000	and PSP games
2428000	2430000	and it's traveling all over
2430000	2432000	the country so if you go to
2432000	2434000	us.playstation.com
2434000	2436000	you can find links to
2436000	2438000	tour dates there. Do you happen to have the dates
2438000	2440000	in front of you by chance? I was just wondering if there's
2440000	2442000	anything local where you can go crash. There's
2442000	2444000	very few tour dates.
2444000	2446000	That's alright.
2446000	2448000	So not a big tour right now. No it's like
2448000	2450000	each truck's doing like four different
2450000	2452000	cities and that's it. Huh.
2452000	2454000	Actually I have
2454000	2456000	three locations according to this one.
2456000	2458000	And that's just Baltimore
2458000	2460000	and Milwaukee. But maybe
2460000	2462000	more to come. Maybe.
2462000	2464000	Cause when that Rock Band tour
2464000	2466000	started didn't they only have a few dates and then
2466000	2468000	finally it like exploded into like all
2468000	2470000	these places before the game came out. Okay here we go.
2470000	2472000	Oh yes. The
2472000	2474000	PlayStation Patrol tour
2474000	2476000	is going to Davenport
2476000	2478000	Iowa, Huntsville Alabama.
2478000	2480000	I should go visit my family. No.
2480000	2482000	Trevor City Michigan and
2482000	2484000	New York City.
2484000	2486000	Why they gotta hate the West Coast?
2486000	2488000	Not a single
2488000	2490000	West Coast date in there.
2490000	2492000	But the New York City date is July 11th
2492000	2494000	through July 15th so if any of our listeners
2494000	2496000	get the urge go check it out
2496000	2498000	for us. Yeah and please go ask them why they hate
2498000	2500000	us so much on the West Coast. Oh.
2502000	2504000	They were probably
2504000	2506000	already here and I didn't even care.
2506000	2508000	They've
2508000	2510000	been here before. They usually come to our
2510000	2512000	local sunrise fall every now and then.
2512000	2514000	But you know we had the signing of the
2514000	2516000	Metreon right? Yes that's true.
2516000	2518000	I didn't see no
2518000	2520000	little big planet there.
2520000	2522000	I just saw you know. Who cares about Metal Gear Solid?
2522000	2524000	It's all about little big planets.
2524000	2526000	I'm no longer falling.
2526000	2528000	Alright go
2528000	2530000	follow the tour bus or something
2530000	2532000	and if you happen to go you know
2532000	2534000	take a camera or something and tell us about
2534000	2536000	your experience. Anyways there was a whole
2536000	2538000	bunch of drama last week with
2538000	2540000	Itagaki leaving Tecmo
2540000	2542000	and Team Ninja behind.
2542000	2544000	I am surprised he did not tip over
2544000	2546000	everything on his way out.
2546000	2548000	If he has we probably just
2548000	2550000	haven't heard it yet. Exactly he probably
2550000	2552000	just you know threw a manager through a window
2552000	2554000	and then jumped down you know.
2554000	2556000	While setting the building on fire and
2556000	2558000	it just blew up behind him in like an elaborate
2558000	2560000	explosion. See that's the thing
2560000	2562000	is you know he does it in style.
2562000	2564000	Everything. Everything he does.
2564000	2566000	Anyways
2566000	2568000	so they have
2568000	2570000	served a gag
2570000	2572000	order for him to
2572000	2574000	basically not disclose or
2574000	2576000	leak any Tecmo trade
2576000	2578000	secrets and you know
2578000	2580000	make any false or misleading statements
2580000	2582000	etc. etc. The only problem is though
2582000	2584000	it hasn't been signed off by the court yet so he's
2584000	2586000	talking now.
2586000	2588000	Yeah so Itagaki put out a press statement
2588000	2590000	of his own that says you don't tell me to shut the fuck
2590000	2592000	up.
2592000	2594000	I come back and kill you again.
2594000	2596000	I do what I want.
2598000	2600000	Now his his his press
2600000	2602000	statement when it was faxed out it was
2602000	2604000	just a big middle finger.
2604000	2606000	And then it burst into fire.
2606000	2608000	Because he's that awesome.
2608000	2610000	He's such a rock star.
2610000	2612000	I bet it was on paper that's
2612000	2614000	flammable as soon as it opened.
2614000	2616000	Have we had the
2616000	2618000	burning finger. Have we had the concept
2618000	2620000	on this show before to have a
2620000	2622000	game where you just you are Itagaki.
2622000	2624000	I mean this would be a great
2624000	2626000	now like like before it's like where what
2626000	2628000	could the game be like you know oh you're
2628000	2630000	just you're Itagaki you sleep with chicks you burn
2630000	2632000	hotel rooms down understand now
2632000	2634000	now we have a purpose because he got kicked
2634000	2636000	out of Tecmo now you got now you have
2636000	2638000	good motives yes and
2638000	2640000	motive well there could definitely be a game here.
2640000	2642000	We're going to elevate him to a
2642000	2644000	Chuck Norris status you know he's going to
2644000	2646000	be immortal at some point.
2646000	2648000	He is the Chuck Norris of game designers really.
2648000	2650000	Anyways
2650000	2652000	Itagaki. He laughs at Chuck Norris.
2652000	2654000	Yes.
2654000	2656000	He doesn't have to do anything better than Chuck
2656000	2658000	Norris because you think Chuck Norris is fucking funny.
2658000	2660000	Of course Tecmo
2660000	2662000	the man denies that
2662000	2664000	Team Ninja is actually leaving them
2664000	2666000	and also
2666000	2668000	kind of denying different aspects about the lawsuit.
2668000	2670000	One of the things that they say
2670000	2672000	was inaccurate was that all of the
2672000	2674000	employees were suing
2674000	2676000	Tecmo. Well
2676000	2678000	yes and no it's actually two employees suing
2678000	2680000	Tecmo on behalf of
2680000	2682000	all the other employees so
2682000	2684000	I'd like some sort of convoluted class
2684000	2686000	action. Yeah there's a whole lot of weird
2686000	2688000	stuff going on there. Japanese law is
2688000	2690000	kind of funny anyway. Not paying overtime
2690000	2692000	and that kind of thing you know.
2692000	2694000	I don't know.
2696000	2698000	Is this why you know
2698000	2700000	Tecmo Bowl is just
2700000	2702000	taking forever to come out. Team Ninja doesn't do
2702000	2704000	Tecmo Bowl. I understand. Team Ninja should
2704000	2706000	do Tecmo Bowl.
2706000	2708000	Ninja Bowl
2708000	2710000	that'll be fun.
2710000	2712000	Rob do you remember Battle Chess?
2712000	2714000	Oh yeah hell yeah. Where they would like
2714000	2716000	kill each other and everything. That was awesome.
2716000	2718000	They should have like battle football.
2718000	2720000	All right.
2720000	2722000	Well listen this is what
2722000	2724000	Itagaki's new job is going to be
2724000	2726000	okay.
2726000	2728000	Basically if you imagine
2728000	2730000	you know like a kitchen
2730000	2732000	stadium except it's not
2732000	2734000	a kitchen stadium it's just a
2734000	2736000	stadium with Itagaki being
2736000	2738000	the chairman and he has people fight each
2738000	2740000	other to the death with a secret weapon
2740000	2742000	that is revealed on each show.
2744000	2746000	I like it.
2746000	2748000	So Itagaki should not be so worried
2748000	2750000	about this divorce from Tecmo because he will be
2750000	2752000	a rock star elsewhere. Oh yeah they'll pick him up
2752000	2754000	that Microsoft will probably have him work
2754000	2756000	for him.
2756000	2758000	Nice.
2758000	2760000	Meanwhile in another part of the galaxy
2760000	2762000	Sony is
2762000	2764000	they're kind of fiddling
2764000	2766000	with this whole idea of getting into the
2766000	2768000	gaming phone.
2768000	2770000	You know especially because
2770000	2772000	Apple you know you heard them at the
2772000	2774000	conference a couple weeks ago they announced
2774000	2776000	you know that the iPhone is expanding into more
2776000	2778000	and more gaming outlets when they showed the
2778000	2780000	pictures of Monkey Ball and all this stuff.
2780000	2782000	It looks like
2782000	2784000	Sony might be getting into gaming a little more
2784000	2786000	themselves. It's Sony Ericsson
2786000	2788000	F30
2788000	2790000	or 05 the F305
2790000	2792000	is this new model of Sony Ericsson
2792000	2794000	it kind of sort of like
2794000	2796000	has this giant screen on it that's iPhone
2796000	2798000	ish. But here's the thing that's interesting
2798000	2800000	about it. There's a up down
2800000	2802000	left right little control maneuver. Okay
2802000	2804000	well whatever you probably seen those on the phone although that looks
2804000	2806000	kind of like a game controller. But the buttons
2806000	2808000	are also labeled X and O just
2808000	2810000	kind of like you would have on a Playstation
2810000	2812000	controller. And
2812000	2814000	the system here little Sony Ericsson
2814000	2816000	comes with games on it.
2816000	2818000	Bowling bash fishing
2818000	2820000	and jockey and it
2820000	2822000	all of them use an accelerometer
2822000	2824000	that is actually located inside
2824000	2826000	the device as well. Why in the hell does
2826000	2828000	your phone need an accelerometer. I'm not sure
2828000	2830000	unless like it knows to shut off
2830000	2832000	if it's falling out of your pocket or something
2832000	2834000	I don't know. But
2834000	2836000	it does have one in it.
2836000	2838000	Or if it senses that you're falling
2838000	2840000	for a long time it's like you're falling
2840000	2842000	to your death. Do you wish to call loved ones.
2842000	2846000	Yes or no.
2846000	2848000	Oh nice.
2848000	2850000	It shouldn't
2850000	2852000	ask you yes or no because all it's going to get is
2852000	2854000	it's
2854000	2856000	all it's going to get
2856000	2858000	because I think if you're falling out of a plane
2858000	2860000	your death you're not going to have time to say oh
2860000	2862000	yes. Hey I don't know
2862000	2864000	are you trying to tell me though that
2864000	2866000	no wait I mean cake
2866000	2868000	are
2868000	2870000	you trying to tell me that crank was
2870000	2872000	fake. That movie was fake
2872000	2874000	that he couldn't like fall out of
2874000	2876000	a helicopter and have time to call his loved
2876000	2878000	one on the cell phone and then land and
2878000	2880000	die. It
2880000	2882000	was fake in the movie but it was real
2882000	2884000	when it got he did it
2884000	2886000	said he landed and he's like fuck this
2886000	2888000	I'm too cool to die and then shot the
2888000	2890000	plane down. All right.
2890000	2892000	All
2892000	2894000	right. Well how
2894000	2896000	about some completely innocent and happy
2896000	2898000	news. No
2898000	2900000	Disney
2900000	2902000	this makes me kind of
2902000	2904000	I just think it's funny because I'm going to have to
2904000	2906000	draw the parallel okay.
2906000	2908000	Disney is making a
2908000	2910000	game about a dog
2910000	2912000	who shoots laser beams
2912000	2914000	from his eyes and
2914000	2916000	barks with a sonic boom. Wait a minute
2916000	2918000	I think I've heard
2918000	2920000	of this game before.
2920000	2922000	What. Go ahead continue on.
2922000	2924000	It's an animated movie.
2924000	2926000	And his owner is called Penny
2926000	2928000	who besides me is thinking
2928000	2930000	Inspector Gadget.
2930000	2932000	I'm sorry brain is not that cool.
2932000	2934000	Okay but
2934000	2936000	it's a girl named Penny who
2936000	2938000	who hacks. She's a hacker.
2938000	2940000	This is Inspector Gadget
2940000	2942000	but with the cooler dog. Little kids are not
2942000	2944000	hackers. It's like you mix
2944000	2946000	Inspector Gadget and the dog and
2946000	2948000	give him John Travolta's voice. Wait I have a
2948000	2950000	question for the nerdy wait

3190000	3192000	wow I think I saw boobs like that
3192000	3194000	on the Jerry Springer show once that's about it
3196000	3198000	alright
3198000	3200000	gee I have no idea why that character was
3200000	3202000	picked for the game I mean
3202000	3204000	Robin I've heard of Wonder Woman I've heard
3204000	3206000	of pretty much every single one of those other characters
3206000	3208000	you've named I've heard of Power Girl
3208000	3210000	I had never heard of but now I understand why
3210000	3212000	she's in the game
3212000	3214000	I want the
3214000	3216000	Joker though I want Harley
3216000	3218000	I want Harley Quinn
3218000	3220000	what's up with that
3220000	3222000	what's up with that what is up with that
3222000	3224000	alright what's up with this
3224000	3226000	yeah seriously like if you look at some of these
3226000	3228000	just do like a
3228000	3230000	Google image search they've got
3230000	3232000	one that's like
3232000	3234000	crap
3234000	3236000	wow
3236000	3238000	that's a little over the top
3238000	3240000	massive approval
3242000	3244000	Loki had you ever heard
3244000	3246000	of Power Girl before tonight
3246000	3248000	nope
3248000	3250000	but now you'll never forget
3250000	3252000	no I probably will alright
3252000	3254000	I'm not a big
3254000	3256000	I've made no secret of it that I'm not
3256000	3258000	the world's biggest DC fan
3258000	3260000	but I've got characters I like
3260000	3262000	and I like her because she's bitchy
3262000	3264000	she's fair
3264000	3266000	and she's got boobs
3266000	3268000	hitstun says Harley Quinn
3268000	3270000	was the first character I made in Soul Calibur 3
3270000	3272000	in the create your own character mode
3272000	3274000	I think the first character I made
3274000	3276000	was a totally naked person wearing
3276000	3278000	a bishop's hat
3278000	3280000	that did like capoeira dancing
3280000	3282000	or something it was crazy
3282000	3284000	alright
3284000	3286000	anyhow I have no idea
3286000	3288000	how to segue into this story
3288000	3290000	so I will just say the ESRB
3290000	3292000	is sadly going to
3292000	3294000	probably no longer be
3294000	3296000	leaking game announcements early
3296000	3298000	cause you know we find out about all these cool games
3298000	3300000	cause they show up on the ESRB's website
3300000	3302000	there was Earthbound coming to the Wii
3302000	3304000	we found out about that early
3304000	3306000	Castlevania
3306000	3308000	the full name of that game
3308000	3310000	why are you still laughing Loki
3310000	3312000	so speaking of big boobs
3312000	3314000	I hear giggling in my right ear
3314000	3316000	oh it's Andrew
3316000	3318000	he started off a joke
3318000	3320000	and I don't know where it's going
3320000	3322000	is it from the toilet paper book
3322000	3324000	I was going to say though
3324000	3326000	yeah it sucks that the ESRB
3326000	3328000	wait wait I didn't even say why
3328000	3330000	let me finish the story
3330000	3332000	now
3332000	3334000	when these companies submit the games to get the rating
3334000	3336000	they can actually fill in a date
3336000	3338000	when the title will be uploaded
3338000	3340000	on the ESRB's website
3340000	3342000	if the company for whatever reason doesn't fill it out
3342000	3344000	though it will automatically
3344000	3346000	go on the website 30 days after it's rated
3346000	3348000	so basically companies can now choose
3348000	3350000	what date the game will go on the website
3350000	3352000	but the ESRB is saying don't abuse this
3352000	3354000	which is kind of interesting
3354000	3356000	in the memo that went out about this
3356000	3358000	quote the ESRB system will not work for consumers
3358000	3360000	if publishers arbitrarily
3360000	3362000	select dates bearing no reasonable
3362000	3364000	relationships to consumers interest
3364000	3366000	in the product
3366000	3368000	but it should be noted this would still have
3368000	3370000	no effect on some of the other ways that games
3370000	3372000	have been leaked through official agencies
3372000	3374000	such as the OFLC in Australia
3374000	3376000	exactly
3376000	3378000	now Loki
3378000	3380000	you had a comment
3380000	3382000	that's exactly what I was going to say
3382000	3384000	well that doesn't stop everybody else from doing it
3384000	3386000	and besides you know
3386000	3388000	there's a lot of other ways to find out about leaked dates
3390000	3392000	but you don't know of any of them right?
3392000	3394000	of course not
3394000	3396000	alright well you know what
3396000	3398000	I don't know about you guys but I kind of liked
3398000	3400000	when the ESRB would leak things early
3400000	3402000	and now I feel like I'm going to be sitting in the dark
3402000	3404000	until they want me to know about released dates
3404000	3406000	and I like ruining Christmas
3406000	3408000	I like finding out about stuff early
3408000	3410000	so this ESRB news
3410000	3412000	kind of makes me a little bit angsty
3412000	3414000	and when I get angsty we cue the FU music
3414000	3416000	music
3430000	3432000	just a massive FU
3432000	3434000	to the assholes
3434000	3436000	on the Ragnarok server I play on
3436000	3438000	who are duplicating items
3438000	3440000	and selling them and basically
3440000	3442000	doing a whole bunch of shit that's now
3442000	3444000	I wouldn't say it's completely ruined everything
3444000	3446000	but it's made things difficult for other people
3446000	3448000	so
3448000	3474000	FU to them
3479000	3481000	I have two FUs of the week
3481000	3483000	my first FU goes to me
3483000	3485000	for spending $10 to go watch The Happening
3485000	3487000	which was horrible
3487000	3489000	and not even like so bad it was good
3489000	3491000	like Showgirls
3491000	3493000	you know bad
3493000	3495000	but it was just bad
3495000	3497000	it was really really bad
3497000	3499000	my other FU goes to the fact
3499000	3501000	this is a much bigger FU
3501000	3503000	my other FU goes to the fact that I had to have not just one
3503000	3505000	but two MRIs last week
3505000	3507000	I went in for an MRI
3507000	3509000	if you've been listening to this show the past three months
3509000	3511000	I've been having issues with my pancreas
3511000	3513000	that kept me out a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital
3513000	3515000	blah blah blah cry me a river
3515000	3517000	but I was having a follow up appointment to check on my pancreas
3517000	3519000	on Thursday I had an MRI
3519000	3521000	and I don't know if you've ever had an MRI done
3521000	3523000	but if you have to drink this really nasty stuff
3523000	3525000	before you have an MRI
3525000	3527000	it's wretched
3527000	3529000	this barium stuff is wretched
3529000	3531000	they were probably trying to eliminate your pancreas
3531000	3533000	well no
3533000	3535000	it's not so much that
3535000	3537000	it's horrible but having to leave work early
3537000	3539000	go to this place or whatever
3539000	3541000	so I went in on Thursday had it done
3541000	3543000	they called me at five o'clock at night
3543000	3545000	oh Rob the thing that your doctor
3545000	3547000	wanted to see doesn't come out
3547000	3549000	clear in our MRI thing
3549000	3551000	because we have an older MRI thing out here in Folsom
3551000	3553000	we need you to go to our Roseville office
3553000	3555000	where they have a newer MRI machine
3555000	3557000	things you could have told me about
3557000	3559000	the first time
3559000	3561000	it wasn't written on there what my doctor was looking for
3561000	3563000	or nothing I mean if you didn't think it was going to come up on the old one
3563000	3565000	why didn't you just tell me to go to the new place to start with
3565000	3567000	instead of making me miss two days of work
3567000	3569000	and have to drink that nasty nasty stuff twice
3569000	3571000	so
3571000	3573000	but anyway I'm hoping the MRIs
3573000	3575000	show that I'm healthy again
3575000	3577000	because otherwise I'll be filled with more FUs
3577000	3579000	and nobody wants that
3579000	3581000	Andrew
3581000	3583000	first of all FU to GameStop
3583000	3585000	for closing at six on Sundays
3585000	3587000	I was going to go in and
3587000	3589000	apparently they were giving away deoxys
3589000	3591000	at GameStop all weekend
3591000	3593000	just missed by two minutes

3611000	3613000	alrighty
3613000	3615000	that's going to do it
3615000	3617000	then for our FUs of the week
3617000	3619000	Miek LaTov left
3619000	3621000	the room, I guess he
3621000	3623000	finished the book so he had to go find something else to do
3623000	3625000	alright so

3879000	3881000	be a crab fisher I guess
3881000	3883000	Guitar Hero
3883000	3885000	Aerosmith that's coming out on
3885000	3887000	Playstation 2, Xbox 360
3887000	3889000	PS3 and
3889000	3891000	the Wii as well as
3891000	3893000	bundles and all those
3893000	3895000	and that
3895000	3897000	would be it
3897000	3899000	That's a pretty busy week for games
3899000	3901000	here in America even though there's not a whole lot of
3901000	3903000	AAA titles
3903000	3905000	I guess maybe Guitar Hero Aerosmith and Guitar Hero
3905000	3907000	on tour but not a lot of huge stuff
3907000	3909000	but pretty busy
3909000	3911000	Alone in the Dark was pretty awesome
3911000	3913000	Well you know it's not been
3913000	3915000	getting great reviews
3915000	3917000	I heard that it got leaked out already
3917000	3919000	Yeah there was a little bit of controversy
3919000	3921000	over that because Atari is
3921000	3923000	accusing people of
3923000	3925000	Well you know, fuck them, seriously
3925000	3927000	They were pissed off that someone was reviewing
3927000	3929000	the game
3929000	3931000	prior to being released because
3931000	3933000	they weren't one of their authorized reviewers
3933000	3935000	or whatever
3935000	3937000	and to their offense
3937000	3939000	they didn't play a pirated version
3939000	3941000	it's just they got one that someone broke
3941000	3943000	street on so it's not
3943000	3945000	necessarily their fault but I
3945000	3947000	still think it's fucked up that Atari's like
3947000	3949000	oh we don't want any independent reviews
3949000	3951000	out there because god forbid it
3951000	3953000	I would have told them I was going to give it a good
3953000	3955000	review but fuck you
3955000	3957000	I don't know, it's annoying
3957000	3959000	and let's not forget
3959000	3961000	though, and we do have another story about
3961000	3963000	this game, but let's not forget that Driver 3
3963000	3965000	Atari paid off people
3965000	3967000	to give it good reviews
3967000	3969000	Just keep that fresh in your mind
3969000	3971000	Yikes
3971000	3973000	Rapid Slasher in chat
3973000	3975000	says if you buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith
3975000	3977000	you are a tool
3977000	3979000	My husband's buying it, take it back
3979000	3981000	I'm thinking of buying it too
3981000	3985000	My husband's buying it, take it back
3985000	3987000	You don't want to face the wrath of Jamie
3987000	3989000	Alright, it is a waste of money in my opinion
3989000	3991000	but you know, I don't care for
3991000	3993000	these add-on games that are coming out in the
3993000	3995000	middle there
3995000	3997000	I mean, you could put that stuff out as download
3997000	3999000	content I think the song list
3999000	4001000	could have been a little better because I saw
4001000	4003000	the finalized song list today and you know
4003000	4005000	I just don't understand why they can't do
4005000	4007000	like say like a $20 download
4007000	4009000	thing or something like that for
4009000	4011000	Guitar Hero 3 and just call it
4011000	4013000	because they did that with was it
4013000	4015000	Samurai Warriors 2, Empires
4015000	4017000	or something like that, they were going to
4017000	4019000	release its own 360 game for that
4019000	4021000	but they decided, hey, you know what
4021000	4023000	it's not really that much different, I mean
4023000	4025000	it's just kind of an add-on, so we're just going to
4025000	4027000	release this as download content and that's what they did
4027000	4029000	I don't understand why they just don't do that with this
4029000	4031000	He took it back
4031000	4033000	Probably because of the PS2 owners
4033000	4035000	Damn right he took it back
4035000	4037000	Yeah, but you can release it on those systems
4037000	4039000	but just don't release it
4039000	4041000	Just like the rock band Track Packs
4041000	4043000	They can release that stuff
4043000	4045000	standalone or you can do a download
4045000	4047000	for cheaper
4047000	4049000	Now Rapid Slasher clarifies the comment and says
4049000	4051000	it's just that the song list is really weak
4051000	4053000	and I kind of agree
4053000	4055000	My husband's favorite band is Aerosmith
4055000	4057000	He probably won't be too interested in
4057000	4059000	Guitar Hero Metallica next year
4059000	4061000	That's for me
4061000	4063000	Guitar Hero Tool isn't a bad idea though
4063000	4065000	Yeah, I mean
4065000	4067000	I like Aerosmith and all
4067000	4069000	but I'm more of just a fan of Guitar Hero
4069000	4071000	and I wouldn't mind having a lot of
4071000	4073000	new songs to play from
4073000	4075000	I'm not buying any of these games
4075000	4077000	until Guitar Hero DVDA comes out
4077000	4079000	I kind of
4079000	4081000	want a new guitar too, my other one is starting
4081000	4083000	to break, I've had a guitar hero too
4083000	4085000	but I need a guitar that's going to be compatible
4085000	4087000	with rock band, I'm just not interested
4087000	4089000	Well then you probably don't want a Guitar Hero
4089000	4091000	guitar
4091000	4093000	God, so stupid, I hate both of those companies
4093000	4095000	I really shouldn't
4095000	4097000	buy any of these games anymore
4097000	4099000	until they find a way to make it work
4099000	4101000	Well the 360 though, you do have to remember though
4101000	4103000	that they are at least compatible with each other
4103000	4105000	whereas if you had a PS3 you're fucked
4105000	4107000	Alright
4107000	4109000	Dark Tetsuya says Guitar Hero Journey
4109000	4111000	Yes, I would be there first in line, I'd pre-order it
4111000	4113000	the minute it was announced
4113000	4115000	Anyhow, getting over to Japanese
4115000	4117000	release dates, my usual source
4117000	4119000	of information of Japanese release dates is not working
4119000	4121000	right now so I have an abbreviated list for you guys
4121000	4123000	Over in Japan this week
4123000	4125000	on the Xbox 360, they get Battlefield
4125000	4127000	Bad Company comes out
4127000	4129000	on the Playstation 3, The Darkness finally makes its way
4129000	4131000	to Japan as well as Quake Wars
4131000	4133000	or Enemy Territory Quake Wars
4133000	4135000	and on the Nintendo Re
4135000	4137000	did I say Nintendo Re?
4137000	4139000	The Re
4139000	4141000	The Re, the Wii, Ford Racing
4141000	4143000	Ford Racing Offroad
4143000	4145000	was what I was starting to say
4145000	4147000	but somehow combined it all into one word
4147000	4149000	Lovely
4149000	4151000	Alright, that's going to do it for release dates
4155000	4157000	Well, there's other stuff
4157000	4159000	in case anyone is interested
4159000	4161000	and I am particularly interested
4161000	4163000	in this myself
4163000	4165000	Okay, you know what one of my favorite games ever is?
4167000	4169000	Custer's Revenge
4169000	4171000	Hell no, Dragon's Lair
4171000	4173000	and the 25th anniversary of Dragon's Lair
4173000	4175000	is coming about and so
4175000	4177000	the
4177000	4179000	artistic, I would say
4179000	4181000	well, the animator
4181000	4183000	that's behind it, Don Bluth
4183000	4185000	is
4185000	4187000	from what I understand
4187000	4189000	is going to be doing
4189000	4191000	an autographed
4191000	4193000	version of the game for
4193000	4195000	a week that will be on
4195000	4197000	DVD, PC, Blu-Ray
4197000	4199000	and it's also going to be designed by
4199000	4201000	Rick Dyer who was the designer
4201000	4203000	and two of the other animators
4203000	4205000	Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy
4205000	4207000	Hopefully the Blu-Ray version actually
4207000	4209000	works this time instead of
4209000	4211000	it being broken
4211000	4213000	Well, they said the
4213000	4215000	Blu-Ray version is
4215000	4217000	supposed to run at 1080p
4217000	4219000	and play just like the
4219000	4221000	original coin-op version
4221000	4223000	and there's supposed to be lobby
4223000	4225000	posters that are $80 each
4225000	4227000	Geez
4227000	4229000	Can we get Space Ace while we're at it?
4229000	4231000	I know, right? Well, maybe
4231000	4233000	when the anniversary for Space Ace comes about
4233000	4235000	How about they just animate a new
4235000	4237000	Dragon's Lair 3
4237000	4239000	I would like to get a
4239000	4241000	Commodore 64 signed copy of the game
4241000	4243000	I'll tell you what, if you've never seen
4243000	4245000	Dragon's Lair and the Commodore 64, go check out
4245000	4247000	some old videos of it on YouTube
4247000	4249000	Not only was the game insanely hard
4249000	4251000	I mean, insanely freaking
4251000	4253000	hard, harder than the actual arcade game
4253000	4255000	I will say
4255000	4257000	It was kind of creepy
4257000	4259000	Like, the music in it was very creepy
4259000	4261000	Look it up
4261000	4263000	It's an animated game that's done
4263000	4265000	just like Dragon's Lair
4265000	4267000	Who's driving car? Bear's driving car! Left!
4267000	4269000	I don't know
4269000	4271000	There could be a clerk's game
4271000	4273000	somewhere, I'm just not sure that's it
4273000	4275000	Yeah, but I don't think the market's real open for
4275000	4277000	in-action games
4277000	4279000	Wah wah
4281000	4283000	It said it right in front of me
4283000	4285000	So
4285000	4287000	if you're looking for something a little bit more
4287000	4289000	action-packed, then perhaps
4289000	4291000	you need a game that comes
4291000	4293000	with a gun
4293000	4295000	Yes, actually there is a brand new
4295000	4297000	Nerf N-Strike game
4297000	4299000	coming out from EA
4299000	4301000	That will feature a gun peripheral
4301000	4303000	for the Wii that's kind of like, you know
4303000	4305000	something that you strap the remote into
4305000	4307000	But, when you're not playing
4307000	4309000	the Wii, you can actually turn it into a real
4309000	4311000	Nerf gun and fire at people's heads
4311000	4313000	Like God intended it
4313000	4315000	It will be
4315000	4317000	$59.99
4317000	4319000	And we'll include of course
4319000	4321000	the gun shell, it's due out November
4321000	4323000	17th
4323000	4325000	No word on what it is, but hey
4325000	4327000	it comes with a gun, so you know, if the game sucks
4327000	4329000	you can go play outside
4329000	4331000	It's Nerf the game, what else do you need to know?
4331000	4333000	Yes, the Nerf game has been
4333000	4335000	Nerfed, I heard
4335000	4337000	Alright, anyhow
4337000	4339000	We're about
4339000	4341000	done with the first half here of episode
4341000	4343000	number 284, our 6th anniversary
4343000	4345000	show, but we could not say goodbye
4345000	4347000	to part A without taking a moment as we have
4347000	4349000	for quite a while now here on the program
4349000	4351000	and paying respect to our elders, and we do that
4351000	4353000	through a little segment we like to call
4353000	4355000	The Classic Video Game of the Week, where Jamie's
4355000	4357000	going to dig through the archives
4357000	4359000	and pick a game in the dusty
4359000	4361000	corner of a closet that she thinks
4361000	4363000	needs a little more respect from you kids
4363000	4365000	that were only 7 years old when the show
4365000	4367000	started, and so on, so
4367000	4369000	Dark Soccer, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?
4369000	4371000	It's a game that I literally tripped on
4371000	4373000	this morning in the vault
4373000	4375000	it had fallen, and I tripped on it
4375000	4377000	It's SMK Gals Fighter
4377000	4379000	which was on Neo Geo
4379000	4381000	Pocket Color in 2000
4381000	4383000	Play some of that music
4389000	4391000	Dig that 8-bit music
4391000	4393000	You know what
4393000	4395000	there's a
4395000	4397000	my friend over at the local
4397000	4399000	plan trade has one of those
4399000	4401000	and he says he'll sell it to me if
4401000	4403000	I wanted it
4403000	4405000	I don't know what I'd do with that
4405000	4407000	It has a really good version of Bubble Bobble on it
4407000	4409000	I'm sorry, Puzzle Bobble
4409000	4411000	I can only play so many versions
4411000	4413000	of Puzzle Bobble
4413000	4415000	We used to keep it in our bathroom
4415000	4417000	It has Neo Geo Card Fighters
4417000	4419000	on it
4419000	4421000	Card Fighters Clash was actually pretty cool
4421000	4423000	but anyway
4423000	4425000	you've got
4425000	4427000	basically different SMK female
4427000	4429000	characters, hence
4429000	4431000	SMK Gals Fighters
4431000	4433000	that are playable in the game
4433000	4435000	It's a 2D, sorta weird mono color
4435000	4437000	Neo Geo Pocket Color
4437000	4439000	did not have that great of a color
4439000	4441000	capability, so
4441000	4443000	the characters are pretty monotone
4443000	4445000	and they're all
4445000	4447000	SD sprites, so it's pretty cute
4447000	4449000	However
4449000	4451000	the characters that are in this game
4451000	4453000	are, you have
4453000	4455000	Mai, Shiranui
4455000	4457000	Athena, Yuri
4457000	4459000	Leona, Shirmi
4459000	4461000	who I named my cat after
4461000	4463000	Nakaru, Shiki, Akari
4463000	4465000	from The Last Blade
4465000	4467000	Hidden are also Whip from King of Fighters
4467000	4469000	and Yuki Kushinata
4469000	4471000	from King of Fighters 97
4471000	4473000	and your boss is Miss X
4473000	4475000	which I think is funny
4475000	4477000	Rob, do you remember
4477000	4479000	that Margaret Cho sketch
4479000	4481000	she talked about being raised by drag queens
4481000	4483000	and one of them was named Miss X
4483000	4485000	and Miss X is Iori Yagami in drag
4485000	4487000	Nice
4487000	4489000	So I thought I would share that
4491000	4493000	And actually
4493000	4495000	one of the characters
4495000	4497000	Yuki
4497000	4499000	is actually
4499000	4501000	the one I was mentioning before
4501000	4503000	is actually Kyo's girlfriend
4503000	4505000	and it's the only game she's ever fought in
4505000	4507000	A bunch of the other guys make
4507000	4509000	cameos, like you have
4509000	4511000	Kyo, Ryo, Takuma
4511000	4513000	Seikenso
4513000	4515000	and
4515000	4517000	Yashiro, a few other people
4517000	4519000	so it's pretty cool
