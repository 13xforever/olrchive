Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, June 1st, 2008.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Could achievement like trophies be coming to PlayStation Network?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
A homebrew version of Portal shows up on the DS.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And could a video game soon teach you to stop smoking?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And occasionally food.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me is always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I had a hamburger.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
It was delicious.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
My husband cooked it.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
He had Worcestershire sauce cooked into it.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Every time I hear Worcestershire sauce I think of that one episode of South Park.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Forget it.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I watched the end of the Imaginationland episode.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
That was kind of cool.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Worcestershire sauce was like a long time ago.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I had to do zombies.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Does that look like pink eye?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Sorry.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
If the Worcestershire sauce is cost you to become a zombie.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't remember what it was.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Forget it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
My burger was great.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I have to tell everybody about this because it was really delicious.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I had wheat bun and a little bit of mayonnaise.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I put garlic on the bun.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Like chopped garlic.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And it was a delicious burger.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
It was tasty.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I also have Guinness but I don't think I like beer anymore.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Guinness isn't beer thankfully.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
I think I just lost my taste for a lot of alcoholic beverages.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
For now.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I had a good food week too yesterday.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I've had to really eat a lot of very bland low fat food.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Thanks to the pancreas issues I had a couple weeks ago.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Whereas the bright side is I've lost almost 30 pounds now.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
And haven't even had to play an ounce of Wii Fit.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
The downside is I don't get to eat food I like.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
But yesterday we were driving to the bay.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And I got to go buy one of my favorite places in the entire world.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Mary's Pizza Shack.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I love that place.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
I actually ate like a pasta dish and the bread.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And I seem to be okay.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
I found something that I think you might be able to partake of at California Pizza Kitchen.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
What's that?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Is it if you have them do light cheese on your pizza and get the wheat crust?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Might not be bad.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You should be able to get away with pizza every now and again.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But you can make it yourself.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And I will give you recipes but not on the air.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Alright.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Yes because we do have video games to get to.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Also say hello to the other co-host, Loki.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm three minutes into the show and I hadn't introduced you yet.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm so sorry but food, Loki, food.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm so tired today.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Are you tired?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I don't know why I just feel all drained.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Like I have no energy.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Is it like lethargic tired?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Like I have a birthday coming soon.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm getting older.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I literally feel like I have no energy.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's weird.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Speaking of food, I saw this thing on the Food Network actually.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
It's a local place.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's a dive called the Squeeze Inn.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I think I have actually.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Well they have a burger that's a third a pound of beef with a third a pound of cheese on it.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And it's just huge.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I have to eat that.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
That sounds like too much.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It literally is.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Like you have the patty and then there's like an extra inch of cheese around the outside.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Is that a knife and fork burger?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
No.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Alright, anyhow.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Look, enough food.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Alright guys, I do want to introduce the ever present other host on our show.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You, the chatters.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to join our chat room.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Or of course you can wait until we open up the Skype line later in the show.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
There's our mailbag that's already pretty full this week.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
But if you do want to send an email you can do that.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Mailbag.OrangeLawnTrader.com

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I did peek in there a little bit at the mailbag and you can check it out during part B.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I noticed for the most part a lot of the emails are getting a lot shorter.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
So props to our listeners.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
That's because Jamie gets laryngitis every time she tries to read them.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So it's good. We have some short emails this week.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
So that's good.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I wanted to point out some comments in chat.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
At chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Dark Tetsuya was expressing surprise.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What? Jamie doesn't like beer anymore?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Wow.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It's not really so much that I don't like it.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's just that...

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I'll go ahead and say this right now.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
In the past couple of weeks, like I was telling you earlier today,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I've been having digestion problems of my own.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
And beer has been making me very pained.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Well alcohol is just bad for your digestion system in general.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
It is.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I will probably not be able to drink alcohol for like a year if ever again.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I think I mentioned this on last week's show.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
But it's not the end of the world.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I found I'm okay with a little bit of wine.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
But beer itself...

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
I can have like say a bottle of Newcastle.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I can have a pint of Newcastle.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And I'll feel uncomfortable by the time I'm done with it

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
when I used to be able to kick back a six pack all on my own with no problem.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Getting old sucks.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
No. This has happened all within the last couple of weeks.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Amae Satsuma in chat says cheeseburger, one of our common chatters,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
cheeseburger may have to change your name to Dark Sakura's poo in a few hours.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Gross.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
That's the other reason I actually ate my cheeseburger

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
is I'm experimenting with my food

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
because I'm actually writing down everything I eat

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
so I can see what hurts.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Dark Sakura gave me that look of...

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Why did you read that comment?

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
Geekboy2424 says that he just recently watched the YouTube video this week

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
of Loki drunk playing Mario Kart.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Remember when we have a YouTube channel and there's things like that?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
That was you at your bachelor party quite some time ago playing Mario Kart drunk.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Good times.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I'm hoping that we'll have more things on YouTube soon.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The bad news is that we have no webcam tonight.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
There's no Justin TV.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
The webcam broke and so the audio doesn't work anymore

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
and yeah, I can use the built-in speaker on the Mac

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
but listening to last week's show, it sucked.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
So here's the thing though.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I've picked out the video camera I want to get

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
and the good news is that the video camera can also double as a webcam

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
but it can also be a video camera to go out and shoot more shenanigans.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
You should get that one that they had at the lounge that all games used to be in

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
where they could control it and turn it and stuff.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
No, it's not a webcam. It's an actual video camera.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Remember, it's not porn unless you tape it.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah, and then I can also start my amateur porn studio with my new video camera.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No, just kidding.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Alright, okay.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Let's go ahead and get into How Was Your Gaming Week,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
how we always like to start off the show even though we're like seven minutes into tonight's show.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Poor. It was poor.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Sorry to hear that.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Actually, I had drama this week.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
I had to kick a pinball machine to break into my own house.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Nice.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
That story is for later but anyway.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
I've been getting on My Husband because he's supposed to be getting me The World Ends With You

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and every time he says he's going to do it,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
oh, the store doesn't have it.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So you can't go to another.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay, then I'll have to suffer.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Evil man.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
So The World Ends With Dan.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
But, but, but, but, but I did have a really, really awesome game of World Cup soccer pinball.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Excellent.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And he's working on our Black Knight 2000. I'm so happy.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Sweet.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You were telling me a funny story about Grand Theft Auto.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't know if you want to talk about it now or later.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Oh, fuck. Okay.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
It's funny.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay, I was watching Will play and Will is Dan's pretty much his best buddy.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
BFF.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Anyway, I was watching him play right before I left.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
It just like as I was leaving with my hamburger in hand.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
He was ordering from Burger King in the game.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And we were talking about shot or whatever the crap it is.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Burger hell.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So we were talking about falling down, though.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
You know that movie?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
What was who is with Kurt Russell?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Michael Douglas.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Michael Douglas.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Kurt Russell. Yeah, Michael, because we were watching that South Park episode.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Anyway, the Stargate thing, you know?

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Anyway, so we were making references to falling down and I was like,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
you should just shoot her.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
He's like, no, I need my burger so I can regain my health.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I was like, well, then eat your burger and then shoot her.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
So he gets his burger, holds out the gun and she's like, oh, shit.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
I guess it's like they instantly go into this panic deer in the headlights look.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
And I would do I mean, I've had a gun pointed at my face before.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
So I know the the thing.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And then he shoots her and then like five other people pull up behind him and pull out guns.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Like, I'm leaving. Bye.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
And then and then he also made a motorcycle appear from nowhere and promptly crashed it.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And his friend landed on his head and we thought he died, but he got up.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I was like, your friend's really thick.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
So I part of me does want to pick up Grand Theft Auto just for the lols alone and think in situations like that.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
But I just I have this bad feeling it'll wear off quickly.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I get more amusement watching other people play it.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
You just have to remember, Grand Theft Auto is not usually my thing, you know, but I guess I really should.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I enjoyed watching Loki play it, so I should probably get it.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
We'll see. The multiplayer is probably fun, too.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Let's see. What did somebody say in chat here?

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, SGA 100 Matt says Jamie gets into her house by playing pinball. Awesome security system.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
OK, OK, OK, OK. The story.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Real quick. I got locked out of my house yesterday.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
OK, I have this little pouch on the side of my purse. I put my keys and then my keys fell out.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
So I get outside, shut the security door.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
You make sure it's locked and then realize when I'm reaching in my purse, I do not have my keys on me.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And Dan can't leave the store to come help me in.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
I can't get a hold of anybody who either A has the keys to some part of my house or can take me to go get Dan's.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
So I'm going around the house and I found out that one of the screens actually didn't have the little protective tab in it, which we are going to remedy.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
And I got the screen out, climbed up on this chair that we have outside for some unknown reason.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Had to contort to freaking get in the window because I'm still too short and slid down a pinball machine.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
We know the only window that I could get in was the one that Dan has the no fear pinball backed up against.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So I had to actually push it.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
And then I was like, I'm too short to jump down from here because you know how tall those windows are in the pinball room.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Right.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So I made it down and then had to push the pinball machine back.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
And I thought I broke a leg of the pinball machine, not mine.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I thought I broke my ankle though.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And then it was just really bad.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I've got everything back in order and now the house is once again impregnable.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
But still.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
All right.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Please, please do not be breaking into Dark Soccer's house.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
OK, thanks.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
No, because I'll kill you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
All right.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, with the fish.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, I feel like more Grand Theft Auto 4.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Of course.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Well, I'm just working towards 100% stuff.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Did you shoot anyone in the face?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yes.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
All right.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm pretty sure I did.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Anyways, so I finished all the pigeons.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I killed all the pigeons.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I did all the stunt jumps today.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
And now I'm doing the random friends, I guess is what they call it.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But it's random people you meet on the street.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
They have different missions.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
But I can't give this one the trigger because I think I passed it up somewhere.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't know.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
So that's kind of annoying because if I can't get the trigger, then I can't get 100%.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
And that would really suck.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And then I played this game.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
It's a demo for a game called Crash Time because I thought, hey, this is going to be cool.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
It's like a European game that looks really cheesy and it was cheap.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And I tried it out and it's not very good.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
It's basically like an arcade chase game.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
You are the police and you have to do different things like they'll have it where you have

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
to do 30% damage to the person you're chasing and make them stop for 3 seconds or something

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
like that.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So I tried that and I just didn't care for it.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It's kind of dumb.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Nothing will replace my Earth Defense Force 2017.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And then, let's see.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
You know, actually I think that was about it for my gaming week.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't think I played anything else.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Nice.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Alright.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Well, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I played more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted to Warcraft.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Got it.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Thank you.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
You're welcome.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
But I would like to announce that our guild finally full cleared Karazhan this week.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
We did a full clear of Karazhan.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You have to be a WoW nerd to understand what that means.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
So that's a full clear on Kara and one boss down in Zolomon.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Considering there aren't 25 of us to run the big raids, we have to do the little raids,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
it's great.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And I'm very excited at the news that Wrath of the Lich King is going to have 10 man's

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
equivalent to every 25 man.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
That makes me very happy.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Anyhow, enough WoW nerddom.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I did play some other games this week.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
I downloaded a new game from the Steam service which, as you know, is kind of like PC's answer

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
to Xbox Live, I guess you could say.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It's made by Valve.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
The company did the orange box and all that stuff.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
They sell a lot of other games on there, some independent games.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I decided to check out Audiosurf.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
It had been recommended to me before because it's a music game, basically.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
You know, we here at Orange Toms Radio, we love music games.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
It's a big part of our history.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
So I thought, why not?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm going to check this out.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
So Audiosurf's kind of interesting.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
From looks alone, I thought it was going to be a game like Amplitude just because it was

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
that whole traveling down a course with all the sci-fi looking things around.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Kind of the very similar look to what you saw in frequency of Amplitude.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But the gameplay itself was much different.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
The gameplay is more like, do you remember an old school puzzle game called Klax?

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
From the early 90's, that game Klax?

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
In Klax, there were these little things that would go down a conveyor belt, these little colored blocks.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
What you had to do is you had to put the colored blocks three in a row.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Either across, down, or diagonally.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
That's kind of what Audiosurf is, except it moves much faster and the colored blocks kind of go in time with music.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
But the music is any MP3 you want.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
It's any MP3 you want or any iTunes file you want as long as it's not a protected file.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
You can't use iTunes purchase files, but you can use things that you've encoded in iTunes that aren't protected.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And it plays a wide variety of stuff.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
And it's kind of neat because the game does come with its own soundtrack.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
It comes with the Orange Box soundtrack because, hello, it's Valve.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
So you can play Still Alive and Audiosurf to your heart's content.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
But here's one thing I thought was kind of interesting about Audiosurf.

14:52.000 --> 15:02.000
As you're playing the game, in the results screen that comes up, it will still show you leaderboards for the song you played.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
In other words, it doesn't matter what song you played from your library.

15:06.000 --> 15:16.000
The servers, I guess, keep track of all the file names or it must be some type of algorithm between file name and the way the music file was read by the game.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Probably the CD database, how they have those.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Possibly, but it's not really playing off a CD either.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
But it'll take it off the MD5 hash or whatever.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, kind of something like that.

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
So I thought that was really cool because I played an Echo Image song, which Echo Image is kind of an obscure band unless you're really familiar with the DDR series.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Or Synthpop in general.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
And to my surprise, there were a couple other people that had played the same song I did.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
So I thought that was kind of neat the way they had the leaderboards in that game.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And then you can have your own friends list and all that good stuff.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
And Steam has its own achievements-like thing that you can do in Audiosurf.

15:49.000 --> 15:58.000
But here's the other thing about Audiosurf is that not only did it have the clax-style gameplay, which is kind of cool because it reads the file in advance.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
And the track is kind of like a giant roller coaster.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
And during the really intense part of the songs, you're going straight downhill and you're going really fast.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And you have to collect these blocks really fast.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
And then during the more slow build-up parts of the songs, like the song Skulk by Echo Image.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
During that little tiny instrumental part, it's building up.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm not going to try to sing it.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
You're climbing uphill slowly and the blocks are coming in slowly.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And then when it really builds up to the really hard part of the song.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Understand me now.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
That whole part, you're going downhill like 100 miles an hour and you have to collect blocks really fast.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Cool.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
It's cool.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
But the thing is that you can pick different types of ships as well that you can control.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And it kind of changes the core element of the game.

16:44.000 --> 16:52.000
Like if the clax thing is too confusing for you, there's like a simple ship that you can pick where the blocks are either gray or they're colored.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
And it is collect colored blocks, avoid gray blocks.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
It makes it very easy.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And you can kind of step up the different types.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Or you can do like a ship that will shuffle the colors occasionally.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Or a ship where you can hold blocks.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
It's kind of neat.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I really enjoyed the game.

17:08.000 --> 17:19.000
The only thing is that I didn't think a lot of times the music making algorithm that made the tracks and the blocks wasn't often really in time with the music.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
You're not going to have something as spot on as Beatmania 2DX or DDR or Rockband or any of those things that are pre-programmed for the songs in it.

17:27.000 --> 17:36.000
But I cut it a little slack because considering you can play any song in the world, there's only so much you can do to get it accurate.

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
And for what it's worth, I did think the uphill downhill things, like it's very good at detecting lots of volume, little volume and kind of building the course that way.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
So I give it props for that.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And I would recommend it to the game because it's only $10.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
So there you have it.

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
And if you want to, you can hopefully hope that this game is going to come out on Xbox Live because there's rumors that the game might be coming out on Xbox Live.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And I think that's a really good place for it, is Xbox Live.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
But here's the problem.

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
I think the reason why it works so well as a PC game is the fact that you can use any MP3 you want or any song you want directly from your drive.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Yes, on Xbox you can import your own music files, yeah.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
But do the masses really know how to do that?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Probably not so much.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
So I don't know how successful the game would be on Xbox Live, but I'd still be all for it.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
I mean, it's not like there aren't other games that do use the extended soundtrack, every extended extra extreme.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Hello.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
So there you have it.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Let's see, reading some commented chats.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
Gold Banjo asks, Sky, can't people just edit the ID3 tags and cheat the leaderboards?

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Gold Banjo, I don't think so because the leaderboards are independent for each song.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I didn't notice any type of comprehensive leaderboard.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
So if you edit the ID3 tag, then you're on a new song.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I don't even think it's the ID3 tag.

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
I think it maybe just, they have, I think it's called an MD5 tag where it.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
The way the algorithm's figured out is probably coded into some type of thing that is sent to the servers.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I have no idea.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
No idea.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
And really, are you cheating at a game that's like, I mean, come on.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Hitstun says, actually only looks at the artist and song title tags.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
No hash checking is done and people cheat by playing 20 minute songs tagged to look like other songs.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, that's messed up.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So maybe Audio Surf needs to.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yay, cheating.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Consider the length of the MP3 as well.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
That would probably be a good idea.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
So there you have it.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
So Audio Surf, I liked.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And that was really the only new game I played this week.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh, I take that back.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
I played that new Sudoku game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm sorry.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
It's Sudoku, folks.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
I mean, really, if you haven't played Sudoku and you're a big Sudoku fan.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Here's the thing.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I've abstained by choice.

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
I give Xbox Live props for trying to put games out there that are going to appeal to other people than just hardcore gamers.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
But I don't know if this is it.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's okay.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
It'll be delisted soon.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It'll be delisted in six months anyway.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
And then I played the Warlords game as well, which was, I'm sorry.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I had a little more fun with that because I remember the old school Warlords game, but they really kind of changed it.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And you can notice for yourself.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Play the new, because you can do the demo.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Play the evolved version versus the old version.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The way it works is kind of different.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
The new version is more like Breakout, which, yeah, the old version was too, but the ways the castles were shaped were even different.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
And I don't know.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
It just plays a lot differently and not as fast.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
It's weird.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
No thanks.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
I think I'll skip it.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
It was weird.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
I mean, at least it's only five bucks, and I bet Xbox Live is kind of fun.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
But I think Warlords is one of those games you best remember as something that was at Chuck E. Cheese when you were a kid.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And sadly, this one I'm noticing about a lot of the retro titles on Xbox Live.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Like, I hate to say it.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I hate to say it, but Discs of Tron.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
That was kind of disappointing to play on Xbox Live because that was one of those games that was best left in my childhood.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
What can you do?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
All right.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into tonight's news.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Really only a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

20:57.000 --> 21:04.000
And that is that if you are unaware, our sixth anniversary show is coming up in three weeks, if you can believe it or not.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio started on June 23rd of 2002.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
And so in about three weeks, we're going to be looking at our sixth anniversary show.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
We have no idea what to do for our sixth anniversary.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
None.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So if you have ideas, email them to us.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Don't shout them out in chat because I'll forget by tomorrow.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
But send us emails or I made a thread on our Facebook forums because people were saying I don't give Facebook enough love.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
So there you go.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
If you go to Facebook and you look up the OL Army Club on there, we have a little thread going there, and I am watching it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
We're curious.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
What do you want to see us do for our sixth anniversary?

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
And we'll see because the show has always been about the chatters and the listeners and interacting.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
So why not?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
We'll be your monkeys this anniversary within reason.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I mean, if the suggestion is naked show, that's probably not going to happen.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Okay, Actif.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
We're not having a fuck show until we don't say we are.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Exactly.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
The fuck show is a surprise.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
First rule about fuck show.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
You don't talk about fuck show.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
And we haven't really made up any other rules beyond that because we have to have rules for that.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yes.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
So somebody has to moderate and all that fun stuff.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
So we'll plan it.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Don't worry.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
No, that's the first thing.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
That's for sure.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
Brad from Pod Culture says drunk fuck show.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I can't get drunk right now because of everything else going on.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
All right.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Anyhow.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay, give you some LSD.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Oh, I could probably smoke pot.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I'd be okay.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
You could.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Pots not fat.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
No, drugs are bad.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Okay.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Drugs are bad.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Okay.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
All right.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Forget it.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Please, Loki.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Save the show from drug talk.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
All right.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
This week there was an event being held in France for Ooby Days 2008 where they were

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
showing off a bunch of their titles and one that they showed off only in trailer form.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
And it was kind of at the closing of the conference.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
It's Beyond Good and Evil 2.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
It's being reimagined now for the next gen consoles and I'd imagine probably the PC as

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
well.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
And they had a little teaser trailer which you can see Uncle Page.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
So I don't know.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
It looks cool.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I never really played the first Beyond Good and Evil.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
So I don't really know what to expect from this.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Beyond Good and Evil is one of those really like cult hits kind of thing.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
So I know there's a lot of people very excited about this because I think a lot of people

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
didn't think it would ever happen.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
So there you have it.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Looks good though.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
All right.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Hopefully you'll probably find out more about this during E3.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
That little pig guy thing kind of scared me.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Just so you know.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Did you see the pictures of that?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
That was very scary.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
That's Uncle Page.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
That scared me.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
Also coming to the PlayStation pretty soon because Beyond Good and Evil 2 is PS3, right?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
All the next gen systems, right?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I think so.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, also coming to the PlayStation 3 sometime eventually will be home.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Sony Home.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
Well, Ubisoft has announced that they are going to be doing something special for home.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
They are going to be doing one of their events online.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Here's the thing.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
In the PlayStation Home media and events space, they're going to be showing off all these

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
new Ubisoft titles.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, HAWX, Hawks or whatever.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Soulcalibur IV.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
But here's the thing.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You can only get there if you have a closed beta account.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Soulcalibur IV?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
That's weird.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Yeah.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
That's not an Ubisoft title.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
That's Namco.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I don't know why that's on the list.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I guess maybe that's sharing the space.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Who knows?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Huh.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
But whatever.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
There are these other games at least as well that are going to be in the space.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Well, that's cool.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Because I know right now it's only open closed or I should say it's closed beta right now.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
So those are the only people that are able to enjoy that.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
And prior to this, they did a recreation of the Sony, I think they call it PlayStation

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Day.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
So, they were kind of showing what it would look like for future events, which I think

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
is pretty cool that they have this whole interactive thing going on.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
It's definitely a different way to approach it.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Kind of interesting.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
I mean, since the rest of us can't go to E3 anymore because we're not in the cool kids

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
club, you know, we could go to E3 in home, which I think is kind of interesting.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
You know, the more I think of it, the more I don't really care that we're in the good

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
graces of publishers.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Because we get to say whatever we want in the show.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Exactly.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
I don't mind either.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
So, screw it.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
The hell with them.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
We can say something sucks as much as we want to.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Exactly.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
And you know, if we want to review Metal Gear Solid 4 early, we can.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
So, Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake is old.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
And we'll talk about the hard drive space all we want.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
That's probably why we don't have advanced screeners.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Yeah, that's probably why we don't get advanced screeners.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
Guess what's coming out, though, on the Japanese PlayStation Store.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
What?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
This is on the 26th of June.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
And when I read this, my response was, LOL what?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
They're doing a gardening game.

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
It's called Shiki Tei and basically you go outside and plant trees and plant flowers

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
and watch them grow.

26:05.000 --> 26:14.000
And it's supposed to be 1600 yen and it's supposed to be relaxing for the older gamer.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
There's no word if we're ever getting it.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
But I was just like, what?

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And it made me think about the Saturn game that came out that was all audio.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And it came with seeds.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
And it was supposed to help your plant grow.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Okay.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
So, correct me if I'm wrong.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Always.

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
But you are saying now that I can use my PlayStation 3 to watch the grass grow.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Yes.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
You don't even get the benefit of insects or animals to scamper through your garden

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
and eat the leaves off of your petunias.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Nice.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You can plant cherry trees.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Why don't you just go plant real trees?

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Because real trees take forever to grow, Loki.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
You know how long a real tree takes to grow?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Fuck long time.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
That's how long it takes.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
But in the world of video games, such as Animal Crossing,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
I can go to Jamie's neighborhood and chop down all her trees.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
You can also pull all my weeds up too.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
And they'll be back in three days.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
That's the beauty of video games.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I don't know.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
How about spend the 1600 yen on something better?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Like tacos.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I don't know.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm sure you can find tacos in Japan.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
But if I had 1600 yen, I would just go be buying like maybe some Anpan or something.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Anpan is delicious.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm having a dream game brainstorm.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
What kind of video game could they make about tacos?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
They don't need any.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Taco time.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
We don't need any dream games.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
It's like a burger time.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
You get taco time.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Listen, that's a great idea.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
No.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
They should remake burger time.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Taco time.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
No, we have too many dream games.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
We need to space this out.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
We can't be doing one every episode.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
That's retarded.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
And taco time, come on.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
That's a cheap ripoff.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
That's lame.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
That's not original.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
That's stupid.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
But you also have to be graded on the artistry of your tacos.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Besides, it's a taco.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
No one likes tacos.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Tacos are lame.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
I like tacos.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I love chicken soft tacos.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Tacos are not lame.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
You know what's lame?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
You're lame.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Tacos are not lame.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
You know what's lame?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Your butt.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
You know what's lame?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
A gardening game on any system.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
No.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
It's like viva piñata minus the piñatas.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Or the viva.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Or the viva, yes.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Piñata fuerte.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
I had to cover that for the what the hell are they thinking.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And it's only in Japan, right?

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Okay, it's a neat idea that they're putting out a game that's different.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
For old people.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
For old people that will buy practically anything, I guess.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But 1600 yen, it seems.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Or is it 1600 yen?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
That seems kind of expensive.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
It's like seven bucks.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
That's still expensive.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I mean, why am I saying seven bucks?

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
It's like maybe 1650.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, it's like 15 bucks about, right?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Okay, that's lame.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
That game's worth a buck.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Let's have T agrees.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Taco Time would be an amazing name for a game.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I mean, honestly.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
There's, okay, we won't officially add anything to the Dream Games list yet, but be thinking about Taco Time.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
There's a game in there somewhere.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
More tacos, less drives.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
You can do a remake of Burger Time and add other food to it.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
That you create other things.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Not only burgers, but like other meals and stuff.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Nah, bored now. Bored now.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Well, that's because it was a bad idea anyway.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
So there's your Taco Time. Bad idea.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I have a Dream Game.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
What?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Action Bastard, the game.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
No. No Dream Games tonight.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
Unfortunately, one game that's not being included in the new firmware for the PS3 is Taco Time.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But some other things are going to be added in there.

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
And these are all, of course, rumors, but there's a lot of, I don't know, evidence to point towards it.

29:53.000 --> 30:01.000
So the rumor is that they're adding both the in-game cross-media bar, which is something that should have been there, I don't know, from the start.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
And trophies, which, you know, is Sony's way of saying,

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Hey, we like achievements, but how can we get around a lawsuit?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
So those will be coming very soon.

30:12.000 --> 30:21.000
In fact, they have been spotted already in a video showing the new Bioshock for PlayStation 3.

30:21.000 --> 30:31.000
Apparently, a member of Mac's console forums has posted some images and video during, you know, Bioshock that they've found.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
So, interesting.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
But either way, you know these are coming because, you know, they've announced this previously.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
It's just a matter of time.

30:41.000 --> 30:48.000
But then again, it could get delayed forever like Home has and everything else Sony-related, so.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
All right.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
I don't know, do you think this is a good idea? Is this something PlayStation needs?

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, sure. I mean, because I know achievements have gotten me to play games I probably wouldn't normally play.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
So, I mean, it's only a good thing for them.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
I think, I mean, sure we'll get over it, but right now, since we haven't gotten over it yet, I still think it's a cheap ripoff.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
But, you know, more power to them, I guess.

31:11.000 --> 31:19.000
By the way, I got a private message from Cheeseburger in Chat who's suggesting that Taco Time could be like Taco Mama instead of Cookie Mama, Taco Mama.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
No, it would be Cookie Mama junk food edition.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Besides, they do have a restaurant called Taco Time, so.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Let's have Tia saying, Is everyone else seriously missing the sexual euphemism?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
I'm not at all.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Now maybe there's the game.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
But that would be fish Taco Time.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
That could be the bonus stage.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
All right, forget it. Enough about tacos.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
No.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
That's actually an in-joke amongst me and some other people.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Forget it.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Okay.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Now they're talking about muffins. What's up with that?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Muffins are also sexual.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Muffins!

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Banana muffins.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Blood muffins.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Blood muffins.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Forget it.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Have you seen the YouTube thing about it? Forget it.

32:05.000 --> 32:14.000
Anyhow, the PlayStation 3 game End War is going to be getting some very interesting types of controls.

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
Gesture activated commands are coming soon to the End War game, which is a Tom Clancy game.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Here's the thing. You actually use the PlayStation Eye to do it.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
And you can wave your hands, like if you wave your hand underneath the camera, then you get the game's overhead map.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
And I don't know, it's kind of different here.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
So it's just something that I guess incorporates the eye into the game so you can use gestures to move around.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
Because waving your hands around is the next gen of gaming, in case you haven't heard.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah, that's why Para Para Paradise really took off, huh?

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
Strangely enough, nothing about a 360 equivalent because there is that whole vision camera.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
But no word yet about that.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
The camera sucks and the PlayStation Eye is supposed to be a little bit more detailed.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
How much different are they really, besides maybe resolution?

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
I don't know. I know my vision camera hasn't been used ever since I got it.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I took my picture with it and I was about as far as I went.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Oh, and I tried playing Totem Ball and then that sucked too.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
But the PlayStation Eye, I guess it's a good use of it.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
Although I'd rather see those other games that they had that they were showing off little tech demos for.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
But hey, I mean, if you want some crappy use for a $30 camera, then sure.

33:27.000 --> 33:34.000
Let's just make it so I can wave my hand under the camera instead of, I don't know, pushing a button.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
Because what's easier? I mean, seriously, if we're going to be lazy here, pushing a button or waving your hand?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I think pushing the button.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Well now, just so you know, this is still in development and may not actually make the final cut of the game.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
It's just something that's being played with right now, so we will see.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
I always think it'd be like gesture control, like flipping off the enemy or something.

33:51.000 --> 34:01.000
Well now, if they had it where you're actually, because the article referred the control to being similar to Total Recall.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Or not Total Recall, Minority Report. Why the hell? Wrong movie there.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.000
Anyways, so if it was more like that where you're actually using your hands to move a map around and stuff like that,

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
that'd be kind of cool, but just to wave your hand to bring up a map is kind of stupid.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
Solely907 is commenting on the previous story about the firmware.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
Once firmware 2.4 comes out, the PlayStation Network becomes on par with Xbox Live.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
Xbox Live is still slightly better, but not enough to justify $50 anymore. Agree or disagree?

34:33.000 --> 34:42.000
I wouldn't agree, because I still think as far as content that's on there, there's a lot less content on the PlayStation Network.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
I mean, download content's a little on par, especially with some of the games that are coming out in both systems.

34:47.000 --> 34:55.000
But as far as original games and new PlayStation Network games, there really hasn't been that many that have come out.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It's not every week like Xbox Live Arcade.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
True, although I do think maybe it's time for Xbox Live to get a little price cut, but who knows.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
But they do tend to update a lot more.

35:05.000 --> 35:12.000
I think they should too, especially since they're advertising on there, so I don't pay a monthly subscription to watch ads.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
When has that ever stopped other games from doing the same thing?

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah. Now they're talking about motion-based games in chat. They're talking about Power Power Paradise and all this stuff.

35:20.000 --> 35:27.000
CrunkyBoyJunior says they should have a spinoff of the Wii Fit hula hoop game where you put cymbals in your ass.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
I'm not really sure how that works, but okay.

35:30.000 --> 35:37.000
Speaking of Wii Fit and the hula hoop game, I doubt you've seen this dark soccer, but Loki, did you see the YouTube this week?

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
It was posted on Dig. It was some guy taping his girlfriend playing the Wii Fit hula hoop game.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
But here's the thing. She was a nice looking gal, and she had a nice little booty on her, right?

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
She was wearing nothing but panties. Well, she was wearing panties and a t-shirt.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
And the thing is that while she's playing the hula hoop game, the boyfriend zooms in on her butt.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
And put it on the internet for everybody to see, and now it's everywhere.

36:05.000 --> 36:11.000
And at the very end of the video, the guy puts the camera on himself, and he gives one of those, like, yeah type of looks.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
If you haven't seen it, it's hilarious. It'd be so dumped.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm gonna find it. Yeah, that's happening for real. I can't believe you guys haven't seen it.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
I'm gonna find it. No. I will play it in the studio after the next one.

36:20.000 --> 36:26.000
I don't really look at Dig anymore because, well, especially their gaming topics, I've already seen most of that stuff by the time.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
There's a lot of crap on there, but there's some decent stories that sometimes slip under the radar, like this one.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
So I'll find it on YouTube for you guys while we cover the next story.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
How is that decent? That sounds indecent.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
Well, I have something more decent. It has to do with the PAL PSN update of Stuff-ness.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
They got something good. Like, one good thing.

36:47.000 --> 36:57.000
They got Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix for matchingservice.com with more suffixes to the end of it.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
It's so cute. I love that game.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Ooh, that's awesome. Only a few months late.

37:04.000 --> 37:11.000
Hey, it's £6.99 over there, so everyone download it.

37:11.000 --> 37:18.000
They also have Rayman on the PS3 and PC store for PSP for £3.49.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
Also, Medieval Resurrection for PSP out for £14.99.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
And Go Sudoku Packs at £1.99. Or you can download the whole thing for £4.99.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
And the Army of Two Veteran Map Pack.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
There's also Prince of Persia wallpaper. Like, you care, but hey.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So that's all.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
So I guess there are quite a few things coming to PlayStation Network. After all, who knew?

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, well, late at least. I don't know.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Better eventually than not at all.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
Okay, as I promised, I'm going to show the video here, and I apologize.

37:55.000 --> 38:01.000
I can't make it full screen because YouTube's running really slow because we're trying to broadcast a show.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
I posted the link in chat, and if you guys at home want to see this video, search for a user on YouTube.

38:06.000 --> 38:12.000
His name is Tinsley Advertising. T-I-N-S-L-E-Y Advertising. All one word there.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
So here's the girl. She's starting to play Wii Fit.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And look at that.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
I mean, and she's kind of like, you can tell she's kind of one of those cute nerdy girls, too. She's wearing glasses.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Got a little ponytail, right?

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
And then she has this little booty on her.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
And she's playing Wii Fit. What do you think, Loki?

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah. Loki gave thumbs up. Sorry we don't have Justice TV tonight, so you can see how Loki gave the thumbs up there.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
Dark Sakura, offensive or funny?

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I'm apathetic towards it.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
It was her idea. I'm sure it was.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Oh, I didn't know you were filming me.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
I'm going to the end of the video just because you have to see this guy when he looks at the camera.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
He's like, yeah.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
Well, yeah, you put the link in the chat room, so.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
There you have it. Just look.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
See, now we're going to get a whole bunch of the chat room going.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
You know, I'm not even going to look at the chat room.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Okay, Act Deaf is questioning my sexuality because, you know, I'm the gay one on the show, but I like girls.

39:30.000 --> 39:37.000
But I have an appreciation for the female form. I can see the, you know, I can see why people like this video.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
She's taking it as a compliment.

39:40.000 --> 39:51.000
Anyways, so when, you know, while Europe may be enjoying Puzzle Fighter on PlayStation Network, one game they will not be enjoying is Africa, or Africa.

39:51.000 --> 39:59.000
Apparently, Sony has taken it upon themselves to say, fuck you Europe, and they're not releasing the game out there.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Although, I don't know if that's really a bad thing because the game doesn't look that good.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Especially if I can't run over the wildlife.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Are they releasing it in Africa?

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
I would assume so, since that's, you know, not Europe. So, well, maybe.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
That would be really bad if Africa was excluded from their own game.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
I want to be able to run over the animals. That is the only way I will buy this game.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
They just need to do a new Jambo Safari.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
But, hey, if you ever wanted to go to a virtual safari, then Africa is the game for you.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
It's supposed to be coming out in August.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Do we know what Africa is yet? Anything about it.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Isn't that a Taking Pictures game?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
I think so.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
Pokemon Snap, but not with Pokemon?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
I don't know.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
I don't know. Let's look at the other games that have come out that have been very similar.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Endless Ocean. No one bought that.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
Wild Earth African Safari. No one bought that.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Pokemon Snap. Long time ago, people bought it because it's Pokemon.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And it's fun!

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Gotta catch them all.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
But that Cardcaptor Sakura game, that sucked ass. And I should know because I have it.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
But it came with a spoon.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
I remember. I think you talked about that a long time ago.

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
It came with a spoon and a fork, a pillowcase and a clock. And a plate.

41:23.000 --> 41:30.000
There was also a Sakura Taisen game that came out that had a bunch of weird, bizarre shit in it.

41:30.000 --> 41:37.000
The good thing is though, if you are in Europe and you really, really, really want to play Africa.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Region free, right?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Exactly. So just import the US one.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Africa.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
If you have an HDTV.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
There you have it.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
Alright. Let's see.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Moving on. Talking about Bioshock.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Bioshock's making its way to the PlayStation 3 if you weren't listening to last week's show.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
Apparently it's actually coming out a little sooner than maybe some folks expected.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
It's coming out in October is when the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock is coming out.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
And apparently it's going to have all the upgrades that the Xbox 360 version got and patches and things like that.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
Also, there are new features and content that will make this a must-have game for its new audience.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
As well as for those who enjoyed it on other platforms.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
I don't know if that means additional levels or weapons or other types of things.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
God, I hope it's not multiplayer finally or something, you know?

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Can you imagine if PlayStation 3 had the Deathmatch exclusive?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
No. They won't do that.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Yeah, I don't think the game's mechanics were built for that.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
If anything, if they were talking about new content in there, I bet you it's the download content that was already available on the Xbox and PC.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
And maybe like a bonus level or something, right?

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
I don't even think they're going to do that. Maybe another difficulty or something like that.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
What would make me want to re-buy it if I already had it on the other systems unless there was some really good extras?

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Because it's not like we're talking about a cheap game here.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Maybe the game will be cheap. Maybe that'll be the kicker. I don't know.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.000
What they could do, they could do some of the other cheap stuff that some other first-person shooters have done.

43:05.000 --> 43:12.000
Like a survival mode where they just keep sending enemies at you and see how long you can survive.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
I don't know. More plasmids, I guess, they could add to it.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
WhatupG in chat is asking, when is Bioshock 2 due out? Do we know anything about Bioshock 2?

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
No. I think 09, holiday.

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
Huh. Alright. Well, we'll see what happens.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
I'm still shaking my head over this next story.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Why?

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Because people are so gullible.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
I don't know if anyone has seen the Fallout 3 screenshots that were out that shows basically Washington

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
turned into a big, you know, soot-covered smoking crater.

43:53.000 --> 44:07.000
But an intelligence contractor called SITE, S-I-T-E, Intel Group, thought that they were al-Qaeda images, you know, propaganda.

44:07.000 --> 44:16.000
And a few, I guess, anti-US sites posted them up, you know, and had chat logs and everything about it,

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
saying that this was their big dream to see or whatever.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
But it was, there were screens for Fallout 3.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
So there hasn't been, they haven't heard any word back officially.

44:27.000 --> 44:36.000
But one thing that I did think was funny in this article on Kotaku is that SITE is based in Bethesda.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
Well, I mean, it's actually terrorists are using those images from Fallout 3 or supposed terrorists.

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
Well, I think they're just affiliated sites. I don't think they're actually, I think they're just like terrorist fanboys or something.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Terrorist fanboys?

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
Oh, you know, any political faction is gonna have their little followers, so.

44:55.000 --> 45:02.000
And just to kind of go back a few, well, it's not even really a story, but that YouTube that you were talking about there,

45:02.000 --> 45:08.000
apparently there was some comments on the dig for it, and Tinsley Advertising actually replied back,

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
says, sorry guys, I got on Dig Front Page and, well, my girlfriend found out and she's a tiny bit upset.

45:13.000 --> 45:21.000
I thought it was cute and it actually, or it was done with good intentions if she ever doubted how hot she is.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Over one million views on that YouTube, though.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
I mean, she's an internet star, at least her butt is.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
I mean, she's never seen her face. Can you imagine walking by her on the street?

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Where do I know you from? Where do I know you from?

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
And then as she's leaving, I remember.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Forget it. All right.

45:44.000 --> 45:50.000
That's kind of, you know, if Dan did that, I'd have to smack him.

45:50.000 --> 45:58.000
May Satsuma in chat says, I would buy Bioshock again if it came with the living Big Daddy, then just the statue. It's pretty awesome.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
About the Fallout things, though, I saw that picture of the whole like Washington, D.C. looking destroyed thing.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
And it is pretty scary how realistic some of these games are getting.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
But then again, I mean, remember Independence Day?

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Yeah. Remember when the trailers for that movie came out?

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
This is a long ass time ago, right? Who doesn't remember the movie Independence Day?

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
I guess if you were really young, you might not, because that movie came out when I was in junior high.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
No way. I saw that when I was in college.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Really?

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Yes.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Is it that? I thought it was like early 90s.

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
No, no, no, no. I was in college because I remember going to see that with my friends who lived on campus.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
OK, so maybe I was like a junior or senior in high school.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Because they paid for me. Because that was the only way I'd see it.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
I remember that movie where they installed Mac OS on the alien mothership and destroyed all the aliens.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
It was like 90.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Apple blew up the aliens.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Yeah, it was right before I moved out here.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Here's the thing. I don't want to argue about the year.

46:53.000 --> 47:01.000
What I want to talk about is, remember in the trailer for the movie, one of the things they would show is that big alien ship blowing up the White House?

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
The first time I saw that trailer, everybody in the audience cheered.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Which I thought was funny.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
OK, the chatroom agrees it was 1995.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
So, I mean, it's not like we haven't seen these horrific images, quote unquote, before.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
But, you know, at least when you're watching a movie trailer, you know you're watching a movie trailer.

47:22.000 --> 47:29.000
But when you see these random images on the internet of Washington D.C. looking all destroyed, it's kind of scary if you don't know what it is.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
You know what I mean?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I guess.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
Well, this game may not be as cool as Fallout 3, but definitely one that I'm looking forward to.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Splatterhouse, the brand new remake.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
They've got some interesting features that they've been talking about.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
One of which is the fact that your limbs can basically be taken off.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
But after a short bit, they will actually regrow back.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
So that's kind of cool.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And very detailed.

47:57.000 --> 48:04.000
I guess instead of like a health system, your skin will start coming off, then your flesh and then your bones will break.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
And all that stuff will kind of just grow right back.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Sounds lovely.

48:08.000 --> 48:19.000
Yes. And then apparently the Killzone scriptwriter, Gordon Rennie, and I guess he did Judge Dredd and the Necronauts comics.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
He's signed on to do the story for this game as well.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
So that's pretty cool.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
And the graphics on it so far look pretty good and very bloody.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Much like the original.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Yay, violence!

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
I like violence.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Violence is fantastic.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
And sell stuff.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
I hope the new Splatterhouse is kind of awesome because the old one kind of got boring fast.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
I mean it was cool in theory, but it kind of got boring fast.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
So, we'll see.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
Geekboy2424 is being a little bit creepy in chat.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
He's said this several times now.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
He says he has an idea for the anniversary show.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
The Dark Sakura should get in panties and do the hula hoop game.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
No.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
Here, I'll tell you what. We'll make a compromise.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
I will get in panties and play the hula hoop game. How's that sound?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
No.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
Just kidding. I'm not actually going to do that.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
Little creepy. Little creepy.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Alright.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Moving on.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Talking about Metal Gear Solid 4.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
We kind of referenced this earlier because Konami is telling some people to put a lid on it.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Minor, minor spoilers here from Metal Gear Solid 4.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
So, if you don't want to know, skip ahead in the podcast by about a minute, but these are just minor spoilers.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Don't worry.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Here's the thing.

49:36.000 --> 49:45.000
Rosemary from Metal Gear Solid 2 is supposed to make an appearance, as well as Mei Ling from Metal Gear Solid the original.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
They are going to be some characters in Metal Gear Solid 4.

49:48.000 --> 49:56.000
So, if you are looking forward to being reunited with some of your favorite females from Metal Gear history, there you go.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
And maybe you can convince Mei Ling to get in her panties and play Wii Fit. I don't know.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
No.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
You'll have to write a letter to Konami.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
You used to be able to piss her off in the first game anyway.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
Anyway, speaking of Metal Gear Solid 4, the soundtrack actually has been released in Japan.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake Gets Old. I'm sorry, Guns of the Patriots.

50:19.000 --> 50:27.000
It's by Nobuko Toda and Harry Gregson Williams, who did the stuff before.

50:27.000 --> 50:35.000
You can actually get it from Playasia for $28, but there are spoilers on the track listing.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
So, if you don't want spoilers, then don't get it.

50:38.000 --> 50:45.000
However, if you do get the limited edition of the game, you will get a copy of the soundtrack too.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
So, who?

50:46.000 --> 50:54.000
By the way, for Bomani fans, fans of Konami's music game series, I did notice one familiar name showed up on the soundtrack.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
Sota Fujimori, apparently contributed to a couple tracks too.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
And he did some of the remixes in BeatMania 2DX.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
So, a little Konami connection there. There you have it.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Konami connection.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
I know.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Just one big happy family.

51:09.000 --> 51:15.000
They kind of do that though with a lot of their soundtracks, especially Contra and stuff has a lot of the Konami artists on there.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
You always see Akira and Sota.

51:19.000 --> 51:27.000
Anyways, one thing you will find this week is it's starting to get a little bit more packed with game releases again.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
So, that's kind of good.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
This week, we've got a bunch of stuff coming out.

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
First off, we've got Robert Lindgren's The Bourne Conspiracy.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
It's coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

51:40.000 --> 51:47.000
Also, this week, we've got the Incredible Hulk game, which is coming out on practically everything.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
HULK SMASH!

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It's the only reason I'd buy this game.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
It's supposed to not suck that bad, but we'll have to see.

51:55.000 --> 52:02.000
And then there's, of course, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360, which looks pretty awesome.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
And also coming out on practically everything, Lego Indiana Jones.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
So that looks pretty cool.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
And Kung Fu Panda, yet another movie tie-in.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
The trailer for that looks kind of funny, actually.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
I don't know. I do and I don't want a game called Kung Fu Panda.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
Because on one hand, it sounds really awesome, and on one hand, it sounds like a lot could go wrong.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Yeah.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
It's based on a movie, right?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Yes.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
That's what I thought.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Then on the Wii, there's Cabela's Trophy Bucks, which looks like crap.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
On the PSP, Hot Shots Golf Open T2.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.000
On the DS, Summon Knight Twin Age, which looks like a pretty cool Atlus RPG.

52:46.000 --> 52:55.000
Let's see here. We've also got the, supposedly, the God of War PSP bundle is going to be coming out this week as well.

52:55.000 --> 53:01.000
And Grid on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Aw, too bad it's not THE Grid.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
Remember that game at Golf Land?

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Uh...

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Forget it.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
Okay, well this game looks aw- this game's probably a lot better than THE Grid, so...

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
But I am surprised we haven't seen that come to, like, home consoles.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
Me too. Maybe they should make that for Xbox Live or something.

53:19.000 --> 53:28.000
And, uh, let's see here. And then finally, um, next Sunday, the Metallic Rose DS Lite will be coming out.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
More colors, yay!

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
It's metallic pink-ish, you know.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
It's light-ish red!

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Yay!

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
Replacing the, um, normal pink, so...

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
So now everyone's gonna go scramble over themselves to get that?

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Apparently, yes.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Can't wait.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Special.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
Alright, let's talk about what's coming out in Japan overseas.

53:53.000 --> 54:02.000
Coming out on June 5th for the Xbox 360, FIFA Street 3, as well as Ninja Gaiden 2, finally makes its way out in Japan on the Xbox 360.

54:02.000 --> 54:09.000
Going over to the PlayStation 3, Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit makes its way, as well as another port of FIFA Street 3.

54:09.000 --> 54:19.000
And if we head on over to the Nintendo Wii, Fushugi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 3, Karakuri Yashiki no Nimuri Hime.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
I have no idea what that game is, but it's being made by Sega.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
And, let's see, it is an RPG, that's about all I know, I'm trying to see if we have any screenshots of this game.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
And sadly we do not, we just have box art.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
Where the guy, dude, the guy looks like he has a little ferret as a companion.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Ferrets are great!

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
This might be a winner already, look at the box art, you can see it.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
I can't see!

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
It's Shiren the Wanderer.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
It's a series that's ran since Saturn, I wanna say.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
And they just had one that came out on the DS in the US.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Well, it's Shiren the Wanderer 3 then.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
But dude, he's got like a little ferret companion on his shoulder.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
It's a dungeon crawler.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
So did Beastmaster, he had two ferrets.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And of course we endorse any game with ferrets in it, so.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
That we do.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Absolutely.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Rob Ferret!

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
I, um, I'm trying.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
It's right in front of you.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I don't know where the ferret is.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Hide it.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Give.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Woohoo!

55:12.000 --> 55:18.000
Alright, um, let's see, moving on to other Japanese releases, that was it for the Nintendo Wii.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
On the Playstation 2, Ukuki is coming out.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
What?

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Ukuki.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Okay.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
That's what I say all the time.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Ukuki.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
I don't think it's that.

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
This is an adventure game from, who's making this, Global A Entertainment.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
And no screenshots or nothing, I couldn't tell you exactly what this game is.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
But the box art is very artistic.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Looks kinda hand drawn almost.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Uh, Ukuki.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
Uh, Yamasad, Digi World, Collaboration SP, Pochi Slot Ridge Racer.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Ugh.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
You can just imagine what that is.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
I'll just leave it at that.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
No.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
I'm sure it is that.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
No.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Pachinko for Ridge Racer.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
I know.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
It's a Pachinko slot machine.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
On the Nintendo DS, Deep Aquarium.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
What is Deep Aquarium?

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
It's exactly what it sounds like.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
It's an aquarium.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
I'll be damned.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
It really is.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
It is.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
No, it looks like the bottom of these.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
It looks like Titanic imagery there from the cover.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Deep Titanic Aquarium.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
It's definitely.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Yes, you too can take care of your frozen corpses.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
At first I thought it was in San Aquarium, but I was sadly mistaken.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
And nothing this week on the Sony PSP.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Sorry PSP fans in Japan.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
That's it for release dates overseas in Japan.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Well, back to a different side of overseas.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
We have our UK release dates and there's not a whole bunch of stuff.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
But hey, it's stuff still.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
One that Rob would probably be interested in.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
I just have to say really quick.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
Hitstun has played that series of games and it is a ferret.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
In the game.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Do want.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Okay.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Thank you chatters.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
On DS comes Etrian Odyssey.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
Everybody's Golf 2 for PSP.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
Lego Indiana Jones for a whole crap ton of everything else.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Mass Effect on PC.

57:05.000 --> 57:12.000
Ninja Gaiden 2, Xbox 360, and for Rob, Civilization Revolution.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Hooray!

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Except I heard it got pushed back here in America.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
So I'm wondering at like the very last minute.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
So I'm wondering if the same thing didn't happen.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
It only got pushed back a week.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Or over in Europe.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It's the second week in July.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
No, that's more than a week.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It was supposed to be out the first week in June.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Supposed to be the first week in...

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Oh yeah, average.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
It'll be out the first week of June in...

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I knew about that a long time ago.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
It just got delayed like a couple days ago.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
No it didn't.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
It's been that date for a long time.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Well that's when I heard about it.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Well people just didn't know about it.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Well...

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
But there's also a bunch of good stuff though coming out this month.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
If Europe gets that too, I'm gonna cry.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Because I love Civilization.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm actually probably gonna get this game.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
Because it seems like it really simplified what was becoming a very...

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Oh god, I sound so like dumb and baby.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Question though.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Are you gonna get it for the 360 or DS?

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
360.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Achievements.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Why?

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Achievements.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Yeah.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
That's what I said.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Why not?

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
I'm assuming there's something for Xbox Live.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Remember CivNet?

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
That game was the sh...

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
I love CivNet.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
If I could find a copy of CivNet that still worked, I'd actually probably play it.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
It's awesome.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Cool.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
There you go.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
Akuma, JP, and Chat by the way just linked the official website for that game.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
Because he actually lives in Japan so he knows a little bit about some of the releases going

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
on over there.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Is he gonna get the gardening game?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
No, nothing...

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Oh, is he gonna get the gardening game?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I somehow doubt it.

58:30.000 --> 58:36.000
You know, if you really want the gardening game, you can just do a Japanese account and

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
buy them.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
No.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
No.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Alright.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Back to news.

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
Anyways, if gardening's not your thing, then perhaps Red vs. Blue is your thing.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
Red vs. Blue just released their brand new series, Reconstruction.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
Now, it's a little bit more serious and less funny than the original.

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
Actually, it's not even really that funny at all, but definitely more serious now.

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
People aren't sure if maybe this first episode is serious as kind of like a joke that's gonna

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
run through the whole thing, or if this whole thing's very serious.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
I don't know.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
But either way, you can definitely check it out on RoosterTeeth.com.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
And I'm pretty sure that stuff's also on Xbox Live, their video marketplace.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
But RoosterTeeth.com for Red vs. Blue, Reconstruction.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
Which, of course, is set in Halo 3.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Very nice.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
Well, one of these days, there ought to be a Halo movie.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
I know that's been all going back and forth, and video game movies seem to be all the rage

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
right now.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
And now throwing their hat into the ring, Brett Ratner.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
He's a pretty famous Hollywood director.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
He did the Rush Hour trilogy.

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
He did the third part in the X-Men series, so take that however you want.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
So do we stab him with our plastic knives yet?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Depending on if you liked or disliked that film.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
He was also on that short-lived reality show about Hollywood that was on Fox last year.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
On the Lot.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That's what it was called.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
He was one of the judges on On the Lot.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
That's the first time I've ever heard of that.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It's fucking sad that I know that.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
That show was poorly rated, too.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I remember watching the first episode and saying, this is lame.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I watched the first episode, too, and went, this is lame.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Anyhow, here's the thing is that apparently he is saying that he's going to be getting

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
into gaming.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
He says he'll, quote, be doing movies that come from video games.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
He also is mentioning that he has ties to the Activision catalogs.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So possibly Call of Duty.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That'd be lame.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Soldier of Fortune.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Who knows?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I can't see it.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Guitar Hero, the movie.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I can see them doing something original, but Call of Duty.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I mean, there's no characters in it.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
It's just a war game.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I don't know.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
It would be hard for them to do that.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It'd be just like doing a war movie.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Assassin's Creed, perhaps?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Perhaps.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
It might be a little while before this movie comes out, but something to consider.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Some other news that was around the internet this week.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Tigerclaw in our chat is sharing, Brett Ratner is also going to direct Beverly Hills Cop

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
4 with Eddie Murphy.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It was apparently announced this week.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I also heard a rumor that he may be doing the God of War movie.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I also heard a rumor that he sucks.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Rumor?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Well, that may be a fact.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Geekboy2424 says, like the Zelda movie, please make it happen.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Please, please, please.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
In true fanboy fashion.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Wasn't that IGN thing good enough?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I think that that was all that there needs to be.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Yes, the IGN thing is all you're ever going to get, probably.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
When has Nintendo ever...

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Oh, wait.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I take that back before it comes...

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Because I remember I was going to say, when has Nintendo ever let any of their properties

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
become movies?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And that's because for quite a while, I had the Super Mario Brothers movie erased from

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
my memory.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I was just thinking that, actually.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And I just brought it back for all the rest of you.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Remember Dennis Hopper's Bowser?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
No, I didn't actually see that movie.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Good times.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
John Leguizamo, Luigi.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I actually have not seen that movie.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Oh, we need to have a movie night.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
No.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Speaking of movies, before we get into the next story, Loki, you didn't talk about it

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
during your gaming week, but you have to take a sneak peek at a recent movie, right?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Yes.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I was screen number 14 for Postal.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Actually, I've been watching that.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
We got legitimate screener copies at our place of employment and got to check it out.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It's actually watchable, I guess.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
They're trying to be controversial.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I don't know if I'm just desensitized to a lot of this stuff or if it just really falls

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
flat, but there's some funny parts.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
There's a part that I laughed at where he's at a job interview and they're asking him

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
all these really stupid questions and then the very final question they ask him is this

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
woman and she's like, what is the difference between a duck?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It makes no sense.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000
He just blows up at her and his day kind of gets worse from there.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I don't know.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
There's funny parts, I guess, in it.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
There's a part where Uwe Abel gets his nuts blown off and he falls down dead saying I

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
hate video games.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Nice.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Any time that he was on screen, he wasn't even funny.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
He was trying to be funny where, oh, I finance my movies with Nazi gold.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I like children.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It just wasn't very funny.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Other parts, there's a part where they use a cat as a silencer and that was kind of funny

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
because it's just ridiculous.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
There's a lot of ridiculous stuff in it.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Well, Postal's a pretty ridiculous game, too.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
There's a gunfight where it seems like the only people getting killed brutally is children.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
That's kind of sick.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And then there's a part in the beginning where they're arguing about how many virgins they're

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
going to get when they blow up a plane and stuff because 9-11, how funny.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I don't know.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
The thing is, like some other movies I've seen that have tried to be controversial,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
it doesn't really work.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I mean, it sort of is, I guess, but it's not like, oh my god, this is horrible, blah blah

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
blah.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It's just kind of, it's such a ridiculous setting, you just kind of get desensitized

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
to the whole thing.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But I will say, having seen other Uwe Abel movies, it's watchable.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It's a bad movie, but you can watch it and be entertained by it, I guess.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Is it one of those movies that I'm going to be seeing at Midnight Mass several years from

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
now, or the trash film orgy here in SAC?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I don't know if I'd give it that much credit.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I would say that it's like Cheerleader Ninjas, but not quite as funny.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So probably not Midnight Mass.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Let me put it this way.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Midnight Mass is a thing they do in San Francisco.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It's a midnight thing they do every summer, and it's hosted by a drag queen named Peaches

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Christ.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Let me put it this way, it's worth like a dollar rental or something like that.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I mean, I would maybe check it out just to say you've seen it.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Don't expect it to be very controversial or anything like that.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I mean, there's parts that they just get ridiculous with, like Full Frontal Dave Foley and stuff

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
like that.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000
But it's just, I don't know, it kind of works, but at the same time it's just really ridiculous

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
and very low budget, I guess.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
DJ Jenai in chat says Postal equals the Razzie movie of the year.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Do you think the Razzies will even remember this movie?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I don't even think it deserves a Razzie.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I mean, as it is, it's 13 screens right now.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
13 screens that it's on.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
13!

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Hey, that's a lot better than the 4 that was originally thought that it was supposed to

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
be on.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I don't know.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I kind of want to see it just so I can understand for myself how...

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It's not coming out for a while, I mean, on DVD.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Not that far away, but not for a few months.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I think I'd like to view.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
All right, let's keep moving with the news.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Some of our listeners want to break so they can go to the bathroom.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah, some people do want that, don't they?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Yes.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
At any rate, another series that has a pretty good following is the Brothers in Arms series.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:34.000
There is actually a book that was put out, a novelization that covers two of the days

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
that weren't covered in the ten days of the operation that the game covers.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Basically, the game is selfless for when the Allies were trying to seize a bridge in the

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Netherlands in 1944.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But now, there's also talks about there being a movie based off of the Hell's Highway thing,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
so that might be pretty cool.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
See, that could work, because Brothers in Arms actually has characters and a story that

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
it follows instead of just war, war, war, war, shoot, shoot, kill, kill.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Nazi dead.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Exactly.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
They have material to work with.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
They've got a good source.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It's one of the biggest things that bugs me about...

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Yeah, but Saving Private Ryan, it's not.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000
One of the things that bugs me about movies made from video games is where they take material

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
here and they try to translate it into something that would be believable.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
However, if they're going to get the fans of the game to see it, then they need to stay.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Like, Silent Hill stayed true to its roots, I thought.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And I thought, you know, how many fans of the series liked the movie?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I mean, just about everyone I talked to.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
But Silent Hill did take a lot of shit as well.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I don't remember the girl whining in the Silent Hill game.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Silent Hill! Silent Hill!

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I would have thrown her off the cliff myself.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I think she just said it twice.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But, no, that was a lot.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Well, it was when she had her dream.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I'd like to point out Silent Hill did have Pyramid Head ripping somebody's skin off,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
so it did deliver her.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That was the greatest...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That was the fan service.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Exactly.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Like, he made the shouty bitch shut up.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And the very end of it, too, when they killed the boar queen.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
They need Silent Hill 2. Pyramid Head rapes everyone.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
No.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Ooh, now I need dream movies.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Oh, my God. No.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yes, Pyramid Head gets set loose on the streets of San Diego.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But I'm saying that there's been other adaptations of, you know...

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And really, I don't think it necessarily has to do with just video game adaptations,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
but, like, you know, we've had comic adaptations

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
and we've had different types of ones where they just completely shred the, you know, original material

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and try to say, oh, but we should have been this.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And I was like, no, no, no, no.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I've got it, Rob.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Silent Hill 6, The Roommate.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
You can actually have where...

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
It could be like a comedy, like a sitcom, you know,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
where some guy ends up getting this roommate because he needs an apartment

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and can't find any other places to rent.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And that roommate happens to be Pyramid Head.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And, oh, hilarity ensues.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
That sounds like it would be a cheesy YouTube series.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Pyramid Head. Oh, man, you're leaving skins of corpses around.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
What the hell?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
God, what was it? Someone linked me to a YouTube series

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
that had, like, a bunch of different horror movie slashers playing poker together.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Nice.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And Jason had to go home because his mother wanted him to go home.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
You know, they have to dress him up for, you know, the guy's parents coming over

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
or something like that so they don't get all creeped out.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It's like wearing a bonnet or something.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Take WD-40 to that rusty head.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Anyway, but no.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Paint a face on him like Jack.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Okay, you realize I'm going to go home and draw this now, right?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Oh, dear.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
But anyway, but no, but do you get my point?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Yes.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Is that if they're taking something that there are already an established fan base for,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I understand wanting to get more people than just the fan base to see it,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
but they need to stay true to their core material.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That's why I'm actually kind of, I'm feeling actually kind of good about, you know,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
doing a movie for this series because you've got something established

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
and easy to work with, I think.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Something that there's not really too much room to fuck it up unless you let,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
you know, Uwe Boll do it.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Well, we'll see what happens.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Well, I don't really know how to translate or I should say kind of move over to this story,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
but hey, let's talk about something completely different, I guess.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
How about something local?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah, something local.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Local news.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
What?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Yes, apparently someone is acknowledging Stockton, California.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Why?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I don't know because apparently they wrote an article about, you know,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 and how it's making people crazy,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.000
but apparently according to the Stockton record, they have a couple quotes here.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
My son Peter was never really aggressive, but once he got into the video games,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
GTA being one of them, he started to push, hit, talk back,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and just become a different person.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It said Stockton parent Greg Within.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
His last name is Within.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That's kind of weird.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And it doesn't really say how old his son is.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I know people that are letting their like eight-year-old son play these games,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
so like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty 4.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I don't get it.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And then anyways, there's another one.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
It's all this other guy who's 19 said he was involved in an altercation a week

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
after he purchased Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
He says at the time he noticed that he had become less sensitive to violence.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Grand Theft Auto 4, tearing a neighborhood apart.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And the 19-year-old says it didn't completely blame the game for his violence,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
but it did affect him.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I don't know.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It sounds retarded.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
It was covered on Game Politics,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and you can also find it at recordnet.com,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
which is the official Stockton newspaper's website.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And yes, Stockton is like the butthole of the Sacramento area.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It's not even Sacramento area.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
It's more like that space between Sacramento and L.A.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
that you drive down on the freeway.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Or worse yet, that space between Sacramento and Fresno.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And you can blame Jesse.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
They do have a good arcade there, though.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Corona as the author of the original.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's Grand Theft Auto 4, criticized by Stockonians.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Stockonians!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Wow!

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Is that what they call themselves?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
That's retarded.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Apologies to all of our listeners in Stockton, California.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The fact that you live there.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Do they have a good golf land?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
They have a Para Para machine.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
The golf land was kind of cool.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Do they still have the Para Para?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I don't know.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It's been a long time since we've been to Stockton Golf Land.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
We should go to Stockton Golf Land.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Why?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
You are actually suggesting we go to Stockton willingly.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
To Golf Land.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
We'll see.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Do they have an S Mart?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Only if we get to...

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Yes, they do have an S Mart.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I have to comment on it every time we go by there.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And you know something else?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Is that they actually spell it out, Save Mart, now.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Oh, shoot.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
That sucks.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And you know something that's pretty funny, though, too?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Is this story right here is basically written about the launch day of Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yet it's coming out a month afterwards.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I mean, talk about trying to fill space.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Sorry.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Let's see.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I heard a mother say she got the game for her kid because he was being made fun of in school for not having the game.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Meanwhile, the kid was 12.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Stupid.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Wowzers.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Kids will get made fun of for anything.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000
The color of their hair, their name, the clothes they wear, the way they walk, talk, behave.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Just get over it.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
That's school for you.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Well, guess what?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I have some more Grand Theft Auto 4 related news.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Benny Hill's coming to a no, it's actually has to do with the kind of an idiot.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And it has to do with a 13 year old boy.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And we can't give out his name because he's only 13.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But if we could, he would win this week's stupid award.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
This is coming from the police.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Paul Chastani. He's a lieutenant of a Massachusetts police force.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It was a male 13 year old.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And what he did, he stayed after class when other students had left the classroom and then pulled an 11 inch knife on the teacher and asked for 20 bucks.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.000
When the teacher refused, he lowered his demand to one dollar.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Give me a dollar.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
The teacher then took the knife from the student.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
It doesn't explain how that happened, but the teacher was able to get the knife away from the student.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And just like punched him.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
But no, no, here's the thing.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.000
The police said the boy wanted to buy the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but his mother had refused to give him the money.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So he came up with an alternate plan.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
So first off, why was the kid trying to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Dude, that game's been out for like years.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Maybe he only has a PlayStation 2.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Because apparently his mom's a bitch for not buying him any violent video games.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I guess that makes sense, because I think it's cheaper now, so only 20 bucks might cover that game.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Actually, it wouldn't.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
He'd be slightly short with tax, so sucks for him.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But the moral of the story is, this guy sucks.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And his parents kind of suck for letting him get away with this.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So there you have it.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And then of course, whenever we hear these types of stories and get out stupid words, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And when I get angsty, people die. Oh, and the FUs of the week happen.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I mean seriously, San Andreas?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
You know, I don't really think I'm angsty about anything right now.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Make something up.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
FU to my digestive system.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Okay.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
For killing me softly with imp song.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Thank you, Roberta Flack.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Uh, Logie?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Uh, FU to Monster Mini Golf.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It's this chain of indoor mini golf places.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
They opened one up here in Rancho Cordova.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I wanna go there, does it suck?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It does suck. It's at the Nimbus Winery.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Yeah, that's where it's big eye pedigree is.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Um, so, here's my problem with it.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
First off, they just put no thought into the course design whatsoever.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It just, it kinda goes around there in a giant maze.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000
There is, there are no barriers from one hole to the next, so you don't know where one course begins and another one ends.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And, you practically have to search the course to find the hole that you're supposed to be knocking the ball into.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So they spent little time on the course, but they have all these cool props that are like all pneumatic and stuff like that that are really cool.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
But really, I mean, indoor mini golf in this area would be a fucking awesome idea.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It's just, why isn't anyone doing it right?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I mean, if I had the money to set up something like that, I would at least put a few seconds thought into the actual course instead of just throwing some shit together.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I will not be going back.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Uh, I give an FU to driving home at 2.30 in the morning and, uh, falling asleep at the wheel.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000
But thankfully, somebody else was there to take over. I didn't drive unsafe, but just FU to the fact that I thought I'd be able to stay up and I couldn't.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I couldn't do it.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
FU to me being weak.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Alright.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
One thing that we will not be giving an FU to because it's awesome is, uh, classic video games that we love and adore.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And, uh, we're about ready to wrap up part A, but we can't do it until we pay some respect to our elders.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And, uh, we do that by asking the one and only DarkSakura to dig through the archives of games every week and pick out one of her favorites to be featured as, the OLR Classic Game of the Week.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
DarkSakura, what should the kids be checking out this week?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
It's a little game called Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Um, also called Daya Makaimura, which, um, is really, really, you know, it's Ghouls and Ghosts, how can you go wrong with that?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
It's classic. Hence, Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Anyway.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It's like, isn't it? Okay, the music is the best.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
See?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Okay, anyway, you play as a knight called, uh, Arthur who has to go through a bunch of really friggin' tough stages to go rescue, um, his, uh, his woman and, uh, save, uh, souls sold by, uh, Lucifer.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And, um, I think it's funny that his bride is named Princess Prin Prin. That's really hilarious.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:19:04.000
But anyway, um, you pick up different, um, weapons on the way, and actually this is a sequel to Makaimura, which was Ghouls and Goblins over here, um, and the change between, um, from this one to the last one is that you can fire up and, you know, jump and fire, um, um, but you also get different weapons.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Never use the sword. It sucks.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You want to get the lances.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
The holy water is okay.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But, um, you've also got different enemies that show up, like, you know, a bunch of demon-y things, and a magician that every so often will either turn him into an old man or a duck.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Yeah.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Um, you also get, um, you know, your gold armor, so you get, uh, your charge attack and one extra, I guess, hit that you can take.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
The really hard part about this game is that you do have a limited number of hits you can take.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Um, starting, you know, you start off with your basic armor, but if you get the gold armor, you take one hit, you go back to your basic armor.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
You get one hit, you go to a man running around in his underwear.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And then one more hit, you are dust.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Um, it has come out on, um, Amiga.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
You literally just collapse into skulls and bones, which is kind of funny.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Yeah.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Um, Amiga, um, Arms Shreds, uh, CPC Atari ST, Commodore 64, raw.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Nice.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Sega Saturn, which I have that copy, and I actually bought it at a Babbage's.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:20.000
So, I bought it at American Retailer, I think it's hilarious, because it was only on, uh, the Capcom Generations that they brought out in Japan.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Um, it came out on Playstation Super Graphics, Master System, Genesis, Virtual Console release, and ZX Spectrum.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000
But, um, it's really freaking fun, and also this game, and I'm going to spoil it for everyone.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It's only been out, you know, 20 years.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Oh my god, it's been out 20 years, it was released in 1988.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Okay, as of December, it will be out 20 years.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Okay.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Um, it was released in December 1988.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Um, but, um, I had a point.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Okay, um, so to spoil the ending, um, when you get to the end of the game, you have to do it again.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
It's like, oh, guess what, remember all that sweating that you did to get through this game?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Ha ha ha ha, we lied, no ending, do it again.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And so, um, you have to go through the whole thing all over.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Um, it also had-

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Sadistic.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I know, really evil.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Um, it also did have, um, a sequel to it, which in my opinion was disappointing, with Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It did have a very epic opening, and it was really freaking hard, but I don't think that it was as much fun as this one.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And then the one that drove me crazy at E3 two years ago, hunting down, and then they kicked me off of playing it, was Ultimate Ghosts of Goblins.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Um, which is a PSP release.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And it was actually really fun, and just as freaking hard as all the other of them.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
So, that's your game. That is the game.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
So if you can beat this game, you have a very big E-peen, if you can beat this game.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I've beaten the game.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Then your E-peen is very big, congratulations.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I've seen my husband beat it on one credit.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
That's crazy.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I've seen him beat a number of games, I've seen him beat our type on one credit.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Thanks.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week folks, Ghouls and Ghosts, on like a million different systems, so check it out.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The system you would urge though, I'm sure, has got to be the SEGA one, right?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Well, Saturn has the arcade perfect version, however, if you're going to get it for any of the home systems, it says Virtual Console as well.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Get the Genesis version.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Honestly, for any of the...

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I didn't mind the Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts, I mean, I know you're not a fan, but...

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Honestly, and this is not a problem because I was always a Super Nintendo fan girl, and I actually do like Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Don't get me wrong at all, I like the game, it's just, it was a bit of a letdown.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Not as good.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It's like, you know, it's comparing vanilla ice cream to chocolate peanut butter ice cream.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
No, it's like taking like...

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
They're both good, but one's got peanut butter.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
No, no, no, no, no, you know what it's like using the ice cream analogy, okay?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
It's like getting Ben & Jerry's, and then getting Thrifty.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I love Thrifty ice cream.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I know! I love Thrifty ice cream too, but is it as good as Ben & Jerry's?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
That's debatable. How about Baskin-Robbins? Baskin-Robbins is kind of frumpy. I don't know.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Baskin-Robbins has egg nog.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Here it is, here it is. Cold Stone vs. Soft Serve at McDonald's.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I wouldn't say it's that bad.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Soft Serve at McDonald's tastes like whipped cream.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Here we go with the food again. Look, we gotta take a break.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I have ice cream at home, Rob.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
It's called Medieval Madness and I bought it because it's the same as a pinball machine.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I can't eat ice cream right now, but what I can have, I have had it pretty awesome.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
There's a self-serve non-fat yogurt place over by William's house that's pretty awesome.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Because you get to make the yogurt yourself, and then they have toppings galore that you put on there.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
There's a TCBY by my house.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Good times. Alright, look, we're gonna take a break.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Okay.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So stay tuned for more of Orange Lounge Radio. We didn't even touch Nintendo Wii News and we got a whole lot of it coming up in the next segment.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
A little bit of Xbox 360 news as well, even though it was a little slow in the house of Microsoft this week.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
We'll be talking a little bit about those systems right after a quick break. We'll see you then.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
