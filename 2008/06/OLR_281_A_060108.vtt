00:13.817 --> 00:15.040
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 1st, 2008.

00:15.981 --> 00:18.988
[SPEAKER_00]: Could achievement like trophies be coming to PlayStation Network?

00:19.168 --> 00:21.593
[SPEAKER_00]: A homebrew version of Portal shows up on the DS.

00:22.034 --> 00:24.900
[SPEAKER_00]: And could a video game soon teach you to stop smoking?

00:31.348 --> 00:35.693
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.733 --> 00:43.763
[SPEAKER_01]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and occasionally food.

00:44.264 --> 00:48.870
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.220
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hamburger.

00:51.641 --> 00:52.842
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.

00:53.082 --> 00:54.003
[SPEAKER_06]: My husband cooked it.

00:54.363 --> 00:57.325
[SPEAKER_06]: He had Worcestershire sauce cooked into it.

00:58.486 --> 01:01.668
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I hear Worcestershire sauce, I think of that one episode of South Park.

01:03.857 --> 01:04.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

01:04.377 --> 01:04.757
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

01:05.178 --> 01:07.358
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched the end of the Imaginationland episode.

01:07.758 --> 01:09.239
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of cool.

01:09.259 --> 01:11.160
[SPEAKER_01]: The Worcestershire sauce was like a long time ago.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.020
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do with zombies.

01:12.300 --> 01:12.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.080
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

01:13.420 --> 01:13.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

01:14.901 --> 01:15.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like pink eye?

01:16.101 --> 01:16.361
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

01:16.901 --> 01:20.983
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Worcestershire sauce has caused you to become a zombie, I don't remember what it was.

01:21.003 --> 01:22.263
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember when they called the company.

01:22.703 --> 01:23.003
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

01:23.063 --> 01:23.303
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.764
[SPEAKER_06]: My burger was great.

01:24.904 --> 01:25.124
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:25.144 --> 01:27.345
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to tell everybody about this because it was really delicious.

01:28.165 --> 01:30.886
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a wheat bun and a little bit of mayonnaise and I put garlic.

01:31.827 --> 01:37.434
[SPEAKER_06]: on the bun, like chopped garlic, and mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese.

01:38.275 --> 01:39.457
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a delicious burger.

01:39.497 --> 01:40.017
[SPEAKER_06]: It was tasty.

01:40.117 --> 01:42.601
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have Guinness, but I don't think I like beer anymore.

01:43.533 --> 01:45.595
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's... Well, Guinness isn't beer, thankfully.

01:45.855 --> 01:51.019
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's... I think that I've just lost my taste for a lot of alcoholic beverages.

01:51.339 --> 01:51.659
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

01:52.200 --> 01:52.540
[SPEAKER_06]: For now.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.481
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good food week, too, yesterday.

01:55.042 --> 02:00.266
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've had to really eat a lot of very bland, low-fat food, thanks to the pancreas issues I had a couple weeks ago.

02:00.826 --> 02:06.251
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the bright side is I've lost almost 30 pounds now and haven't even had to play an ounce of Wii Fit.

02:07.351 --> 02:09.513
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside is I don't get to eat food I like.

02:09.553 --> 02:10.434
[SPEAKER_01]: But yesterday...

02:11.074 --> 02:15.760
[SPEAKER_01]: We were driving to the Bay and I got to go by one of my favorite places in the entire world, Mary's Pizza Shack.

02:16.161 --> 02:16.802
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that place.

02:17.282 --> 02:21.868
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually ate like a pasta dish and the bread and I seem to be okay.

02:21.888 --> 02:22.770
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm good.

02:22.950 --> 02:26.935
[SPEAKER_06]: I found something that I think that you might be able to partake of at California Pizza Kitchen.

02:27.015 --> 02:27.416
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's that?

02:27.896 --> 02:36.021
[SPEAKER_06]: is that if you have them do light cheese on your pizza and get the wheat crust, you should be able to get away with pizza every now and again.

02:36.321 --> 02:39.683
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can make it yourself, and I will give you recipes, but not on the air.

02:40.003 --> 02:40.283
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:41.043 --> 02:42.824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because we do have video games to get to.

02:43.365 --> 02:45.126
[SPEAKER_01]: Also say hello to the other co-host, Loki.

02:45.706 --> 02:45.946
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

02:46.126 --> 02:47.907
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minutes into the show and I hadn't introduced you yet.

02:47.927 --> 02:49.447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry, but food, Loki, food.

02:49.548 --> 02:50.648
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so tired today.

02:50.668 --> 02:51.368
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you tired?

02:51.568 --> 02:52.069
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

02:52.109 --> 02:53.489
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel all, like, drained.

02:53.509 --> 02:54.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have no energy.

02:54.730 --> 02:56.170
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, like, lethargic, tired?

02:56.210 --> 02:56.510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:56.530 --> 02:59.231
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I have a birthday coming soon.

02:59.271 --> 03:00.352
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting older.

03:00.512 --> 03:01.932
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just, you know, exhausted.

03:01.972 --> 03:03.473
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally feel like I have no energy.

03:03.533 --> 03:03.973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

03:04.233 --> 03:04.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

03:04.874 --> 03:09.555
[SPEAKER_02]: But speaking of food, I saw this thing on the Food Network, actually.

03:09.615 --> 03:10.516
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a local place.

03:10.616 --> 03:12.677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dive called the Squeeze In.

03:12.737 --> 03:13.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard of that?

03:14.497 --> 03:15.698
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have, actually.

03:16.059 --> 03:23.487
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have a burger that's a third pound of beef with a third pound of cheese on it, and it's just huge.

03:24.087 --> 03:25.068
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to eat that.

03:27.150 --> 03:28.572
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like too much.

03:30.013 --> 03:30.774
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally is.

03:30.914 --> 03:34.258
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the patty, and then there's an extra inch of cheese around the outside.

03:34.278 --> 03:35.479
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a knife and fork burger?

03:36.480 --> 03:36.600
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

03:36.620 --> 03:37.321
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.

03:38.462 --> 03:40.184
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, anyhow, look, enough food.

03:40.644 --> 03:49.433
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to get to our gaming week, so I do want to introduce the ever-present other host on our show, you, the chatters, chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join our chat room.

03:49.894 --> 03:52.957
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, of course, you can wait until we open up the Skype line later in the show.

03:53.017 --> 03:55.019
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our mailbag that's already pretty full.

03:55.379 --> 03:56.900
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.

04:17.699 --> 04:21.901
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to point out some comments in chat at chat.orangelongeradio.com.

04:22.521 --> 04:24.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Tetsuya was expressing surprise.

04:24.722 --> 04:24.982
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

04:25.062 --> 04:26.303
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie doesn't like beer anymore?

04:26.503 --> 04:26.823
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

04:28.164 --> 04:30.085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really so much that I don't like it.

04:30.205 --> 04:35.767
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that I'll go ahead and say this right now.

04:35.908 --> 04:45.252
[SPEAKER_06]: The past couple of weeks, like I was telling you earlier today, I've been having digestion problems of my own and beer has been making me very pained.

04:45.848 --> 04:49.029
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, alcohol is just bad for your digestion system in general.

04:49.329 --> 04:49.430
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

04:49.470 --> 04:49.610
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

04:49.630 --> 04:50.130
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.

04:50.810 --> 04:54.292
[SPEAKER_01]: I will probably not be able to drink alcohol for like a year if ever again.

04:54.312 --> 04:55.652
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I mentioned this on last week's show.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.593
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.

04:56.793 --> 04:57.853
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the end of the world.

04:57.873 --> 04:59.954
[SPEAKER_06]: I found I'm okay with like a little bit of wine.

05:01.355 --> 05:02.195
[SPEAKER_06]: But like.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.773
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's Poo in a few hours

05:31.991 --> 05:32.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Gross!

05:33.532 --> 05:42.218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the other reason I actually ate my cheeseburger is I'm experimenting with my food because I'm actually writing down everything I eat so I can see what hurts.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.980
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura gave me that look of, why did you read that comment?

05:47.421 --> 05:55.066
[SPEAKER_01]: Geekboy2424 says that he just recently watched the YouTube video this week of Loki drunk playing Mario Kart.

05:55.546 --> 06:00.549
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember we have a YouTube channel and there's things like, that was you at your bachelor party quite some time ago playing Mario Kart drunk.

06:00.589 --> 06:00.930
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

06:00.950 --> 06:01.110
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

06:01.650 --> 06:04.071
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that we'll have more things on YouTube soon.

06:04.471 --> 06:06.412
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news is that we have no webcam tonight.

06:06.432 --> 06:07.333
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no Justin TV.

06:07.353 --> 06:07.853
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad news?

06:07.973 --> 06:13.155
[SPEAKER_01]: The webcam broke, and so the audio doesn't work anymore.

06:13.316 --> 06:17.457
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I can use the built-in speaker on the Mac, but listening to last week's show, it sucked.

06:17.898 --> 06:19.158
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing, though.

06:19.238 --> 06:21.479
[SPEAKER_01]: I've picked out the video camera I want to get.

06:21.819 --> 06:28.903
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good news is that the video camera can also double as a webcam, but it can also be a video camera to go out and shoot more shenanigans.

06:29.423 --> 06:38.992
[SPEAKER_02]: You should get that one that they had at, what was it, at the lounge that All Games used to be in where they could control it and turn it and stuff.

06:39.032 --> 06:39.813
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not a webcam.

06:39.853 --> 06:41.014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an actual video camera.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's not porn unless you tape it.

06:44.137 --> 06:48.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then I can also start my amateur porn studio with my new video camera.

06:48.321 --> 06:48.962
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just kidding.

06:49.322 --> 06:50.263
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, okay.

06:51.472 --> 06:53.715
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

07:07.975 --> 07:08.315
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

07:09.416 --> 07:10.937
[SPEAKER_06]: That story is for later, but anyway.

07:11.918 --> 07:20.043
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to also, I've been getting on my husband because he's supposed to be getting me The World Ends With You, and every time he says he's gonna do it, oh, the store doesn't have it.

07:21.344 --> 07:24.026
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't go to another?

07:24.966 --> 07:25.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

07:26.788 --> 07:28.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'll have to suffer.

07:29.489 --> 07:30.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Evil man!

07:30.350 --> 07:31.571
[SPEAKER_01]: So The World Ends With Dan.

07:34.873 --> 07:35.934
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but, but, but, but.

07:36.727 --> 07:40.129
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have a really, really awesome game of World Cup Soccer Pinball.

07:41.070 --> 07:41.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

07:41.270 --> 07:42.591
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's working on our Black Knight 2000!

07:43.071 --> 07:43.611
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy!

07:43.812 --> 07:44.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

07:44.712 --> 07:46.293
[SPEAKER_01]: You were telling me a funny story about Grand Theft Auto.

07:46.313 --> 07:47.554
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want to talk about it now or later.

07:47.914 --> 07:48.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

07:48.274 --> 07:48.695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.

07:49.675 --> 07:50.516
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

07:50.616 --> 07:52.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I was watching Will play.

07:52.397 --> 07:54.659
[SPEAKER_06]: Will is Dan's, pretty much his best buddy.

07:54.779 --> 07:55.159
[SPEAKER_01]: BFF.

07:56.998 --> 08:04.000
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I was watching him play right before I left, just like as I was leaving with my hamburger in hand.

08:05.981 --> 08:08.462
[SPEAKER_06]: He was ordering from Burger King in the game.

08:09.682 --> 08:10.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Burger Shot.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.543
[SPEAKER_06]: Or whatever the crap it is.

08:13.043 --> 08:13.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Burger Hell.

08:14.664 --> 08:16.784
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were talking about Falling Down, though.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.765
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that movie, what was it, Kurt Russell?

08:19.639 --> 08:20.119
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Douglas

08:43.584 --> 08:47.228
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he gets his burger, holds out the gun, and she's like, oh shit.

08:47.528 --> 08:53.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, they, I guess it's like, they instantly go into this panic, deer in the headlights look.

08:53.554 --> 08:57.778
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would too, I mean, I've had a gun pointed at my face before, so I know the thing.

08:57.798 --> 09:01.101
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he shoots her, and then like five other people pull up behind him and pull out guns.

09:01.141 --> 09:01.381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

09:02.462 --> 09:15.373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving, bye and then he also made a motorcycle appear from nowhere and promptly crashed it and his friend landed on his head and we thought he died but he got up and I was like, your friend's really thick

09:17.675 --> 09:26.023
[SPEAKER_01]: So... Part of me does want to pick up Grand Theft Auto just for the lulz alone in situations like that, but I have this bad feeling it'll wear off quickly.

09:26.204 --> 09:27.985
[SPEAKER_06]: I get more amusement watching other people play it.

09:28.025 --> 09:31.589
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have to remember, Grand Theft Auto is not usually my thing, you know?

09:32.029 --> 09:36.193
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, I guess I really should... I enjoyed watching Loki play it, so I should probably get it.

09:36.754 --> 09:37.094
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

09:37.234 --> 09:38.676
[SPEAKER_01]: The multiplayer is probably fun, too.

09:40.723 --> 09:41.104
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

09:41.224 --> 09:42.987
[SPEAKER_01]: What did somebody say in chat here?

09:43.648 --> 09:46.853
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, SJ100Matt says, Jamie gets into her house by playing pinball.

09:46.993 --> 09:48.035
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome security system.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

09:49.457 --> 09:49.918
[SPEAKER_06]: The story.

09:50.539 --> 09:50.960
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick.

09:51.761 --> 09:53.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I got locked out of my house yesterday.

09:54.774 --> 09:56.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I have this little pouch on the side of my purse.

09:56.615 --> 09:58.855
[SPEAKER_06]: I put my keys in and my keys fell out.

09:58.915 --> 10:04.897
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get outside, shut the security door, make sure it's locked, and then realize when I'm reaching in my purse, I do not have my keys on me.

10:05.537 --> 10:07.917
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan can't leave the store to come help me in.

10:08.017 --> 10:14.359
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't get a hold of anybody who either A, has the keys to some part of my house, or can take me to go get Dan's.

10:15.099 --> 10:22.001
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going around the house and I found out that one of the screens actually didn't have the little protective tab in it, which we are going to remedy.

10:22.641 --> 10:37.688
[SPEAKER_06]: and I got the screen out, climbed up on this chair that we have outside for some unknown reason had to contort to freaking get in the window because I'm still too short and slid down a pinball machine the only window that I could get in was the one that Dan has the no fear pinball backed up against so I had to actually push it

10:38.752 --> 10:40.614
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:57.299 --> 10:57.619
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.562
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not be breaking into DarkSakura's house.

11:00.582 --> 11:01.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks.

11:01.482 --> 11:02.383
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I'll kill you.

11:02.743 --> 11:02.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

11:03.244 --> 11:05.005
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:06.687 --> 11:08.228
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played more Grand Theft Auto 4.

11:08.748 --> 11:09.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

11:09.689 --> 11:11.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just working towards 100% stuff.

11:11.991 --> 11:13.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you shoot anyone in the face?

11:14.033 --> 11:15.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm pretty sure I did.

11:17.774 --> 11:21.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so I finished all the pigeons.

11:21.855 --> 11:22.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed all the pigeons.

11:22.895 --> 11:24.115
[SPEAKER_02]: I did all the stunt jumps today.

11:25.435 --> 11:30.116
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm doing the random friends, I guess is what they call it.

11:30.396 --> 11:31.777
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's random people you meet on the street.

11:31.817 --> 11:32.737
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different missions.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.118
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't get this one to trigger because I think I passed it up somewhere.

11:36.278 --> 11:36.598
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

11:37.258 --> 11:40.178
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of annoying because if I can't get the trigger, then I can't get 100%.

11:40.218 --> 11:42.119
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would really suck.

11:43.580 --> 11:44.841
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I played this game.

11:45.101 --> 11:48.925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a demo for a game called Crash Time because I thought, hey, this is going to be cool.

11:48.965 --> 11:55.191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a European game that looks really cheesy and it was cheap and I tried it out and it's not very good.

11:55.211 --> 11:57.854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like an arcade chase game.

11:57.934 --> 12:01.718
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the police and you have to do different things.

12:01.898 --> 12:05.081
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have it where you have to do 30% damage to the person you're chasing and

12:05.902 --> 12:09.104
[SPEAKER_02]: MakeEmStop for three seconds or something like that.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.825
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried that, and I just didn't care for it.

12:11.945 --> 12:12.465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of dumb.

12:13.706 --> 12:16.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing will replace my Earth Defense Force 2017.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.728
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see.

12:20.809 --> 12:24.030
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, actually, I think that was about it for my gaming week.

12:24.551 --> 12:26.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.

12:28.793 --> 12:29.873
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I played anything else.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.074
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

12:31.674 --> 12:31.894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.501
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

12:34.541 --> 12:37.765
[SPEAKER_01]: I played more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted to Warcraft.

12:37.845 --> 12:38.126
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

12:39.568 --> 12:44.334
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to announce that our guild finally full cleared Karazhan this week.

12:44.535 --> 12:45.756
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a full clear of Karazhan.

12:45.776 --> 12:47.419
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a WoW nerd to understand what that means.

12:47.999 --> 12:50.840
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a full clear on Kara and one boss down in Zolomon.

12:50.860 --> 12:56.683
[SPEAKER_01]: And considering there aren't 25 of us to run the big raids, we have to do the little raids, it's great.

12:56.743 --> 13:01.945
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very excited at the news that Wrath of the Lich King is going to have 10 mans equivalent to every 25 man.

13:01.965 --> 13:02.786
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me very happy.

13:03.539 --> 13:05.360
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, enough wow nerddom.

13:05.380 --> 13:06.581
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play some other games this week.

13:06.681 --> 13:14.725
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded a new game from the Steam service, which as you know is kind of like PC's answer to Xbox Live, I guess you could say.

13:14.785 --> 13:15.826
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by Valve.

13:16.386 --> 13:17.907
[SPEAKER_01]: The company did Orange Box and all that stuff.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.868
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell a lot of other games on there, some independent games.

13:20.829 --> 13:22.530
[SPEAKER_01]: I just decided to check out Audiosurf.

13:23.712 --> 13:24.393
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

13:52.651 --> 13:53.351
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

14:21.348 --> 14:22.609
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

14:38.669 --> 14:42.370
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of neat because the game does come with its own soundtrack.

14:42.410 --> 14:45.871
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with the Orange Box soundtrack because, you know, hello, it's Valve.

14:46.211 --> 14:49.232
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can play still alive in Audiosurf to your heart's content.

14:49.552 --> 14:59.034
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's one thing I thought was kind of interesting about Audiosurf is that as you're playing the game, in the results screen that comes up, it will still show you

14:59.634 --> 15:02.395
[SPEAKER_01]: and Leaderboards for the song you played.

15:02.816 --> 15:05.717
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it doesn't matter what song you played from your library.

15:06.337 --> 15:16.522
[SPEAKER_01]: The servers, I guess, keep track of all the file names or it must be some type of algorithm between file name and the way the music file was read by the game.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.624
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the CD database, how they have those.

15:18.904 --> 15:21.405
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, but it's not really playing off a CD either.

15:21.425 --> 15:22.846
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll take it off the...

15:23.966 --> 15:25.747
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the MD5 hash or whatever?

15:25.787 --> 15:26.928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of something like that.

15:27.008 --> 15:37.155
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was really cool because I played an Echo Image song, which Echo Image is kind of an obscure band unless you're really familiar with the DDR series or synth pop in general.

15:37.595 --> 15:40.917
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my surprise, there were a couple other people that had played the same song I did.

15:41.277 --> 15:43.378
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was kind of neat the way they had the leaderboards in that game.

15:43.398 --> 15:45.700
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have your own friends list and all that good stuff.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.382
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steam has its own achievements-like thing that you can do in AudioSurf.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.504
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other thing about AudioSurf is that...

15:52.444 --> 16:01.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did it have, like, the Klax-style gameplay, which is kind of cool because it reads the file in advance, and the track is kind of like a giant roller coaster.

16:01.690 --> 16:08.975
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, and during the really intense part of the songs, you're going, like, straight downhill, and you're going really fast, and you have to collect these blocks really fast.

16:09.255 --> 16:14.999
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during the more slow build-up parts of the songs, you know, like, you know the song Skulk by Echo Image?

16:15.259 --> 16:19.382
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, during that little, like, tiny instrumental part, like, it's just building up, do-do-do.

16:19.622 --> 16:20.323
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

16:37.705 --> 16:41.966
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that you can pick different types of ships as well that you can control.

16:42.006 --> 16:43.927
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of changes the core element of the game.

16:44.247 --> 16:51.829
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the Klax thing is too confusing for you, there's like a simple ship that you can pick where the blocks are either gray or they're colored.

16:52.169 --> 16:55.510
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is collect colored blocks, avoid gray blocks.

16:55.630 --> 16:56.630
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very easy.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.391
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of step up the different types.

16:59.491 --> 17:04.872
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can do like a ship that will shuffle the colors occasionally or a ship where you can hold blocks individually.

17:05.172 --> 17:05.853
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of neat.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.554
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed the game.

17:08.876 --> 17:18.724
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is that I didn't think a lot of times the music making algorithm that made the tracks and the blocks wasn't often really in time with the music.

17:18.784 --> 17:27.192
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not going to have something as spot on as Beatmania 2DX or DDR or Rock Band or any of those things that are pre-programmed for the songs in it.

17:27.552 --> 17:35.735
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I cut it a little slack because considering you can play any song in the world, you know, there's only so much you can do to get it accurate.

17:36.175 --> 17:44.358
[SPEAKER_01]: And for what it's worth, I did think the uphill-downhill things, like it's very good at detecting, you know, lots of volume, little volume, and kind of building the course that way.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.559
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give it props for that.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.140
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would recommend the game because it's only $10.

17:49.505 --> 17:50.186
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

17:50.848 --> 18:00.986
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to, you can hopefully hope that this game is going to come out on Xbox Live because there's rumors that the game might be coming out on Xbox Live and I think that's a really good place for it is Xbox Live.

18:01.046 --> 18:01.948
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the problem.

18:03.208 --> 18:09.631
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason why it works so well as a PC game is the fact that you can use any MP3 you want or any song you want directly from your drive.

18:10.171 --> 18:16.314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, on Xbox you can import your own music files, yeah, but do the masses really know how to do that?

18:16.775 --> 18:17.915
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not so much.

18:18.476 --> 18:21.937
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how successful the game would be on Xbox Live, but I'd still be all for it.

18:21.997 --> 18:27.800
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like there aren't other games that do use the extended soundtrack, every Extend Extra Extreme.

18:28.000 --> 18:28.300
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

18:28.961 --> 18:29.461
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

18:31.128 --> 18:32.469
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, reading some comments in chats.

18:32.989 --> 18:38.112
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Banjo asks, Sky, can't people just edit the ID3 tags and cheat the leaderboards?

18:38.452 --> 18:42.614
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Banjo, I don't think so because the leaderboards are independent for each song.

18:42.894 --> 18:44.775
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't notice any type of comprehensive leaderboard.

18:45.015 --> 18:47.256
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you edit the ID3 tag, then you're on a new song.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.857
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it's the ID3 tag.

18:48.897 --> 18:50.017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it may be just...

18:51.318 --> 18:54.681
[SPEAKER_02]: HitStun says, actually it only looks at the artist and song title tags.

18:54.721 --> 18:58.704
[SPEAKER_01]: No hash checking is done and people cheat by playing 20 minute songs tagged to look like other songs.

18:58.724 --> 18:59.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's messed up.

19:15.717 --> 19:20.980
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe Audiosurf needs to consider the length of the MP3 as well.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.121
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be a good idea.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.582
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

19:23.802 --> 19:25.103
[SPEAKER_01]: So Audiosurf, I liked.

19:25.283 --> 19:26.944
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really the only new game I played this week.

19:26.984 --> 19:27.604
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I take that back.

19:27.884 --> 19:31.046
[SPEAKER_01]: I played that new Sudoku game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

19:31.226 --> 19:31.626
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

19:35.327 --> 19:36.147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sudoku, folks.

19:36.187 --> 19:42.570
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, if you haven't played Sudoku and you're a big Sudoku fan... Here's the thing.

19:42.930 --> 19:43.890
[SPEAKER_05]: I've abstained by choice.

19:44.310 --> 19:52.473
[SPEAKER_01]: I give Xbox Live props for trying to put games out there that are going to appeal to other people than just hardcore gamers.

19:53.093 --> 19:54.394
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if this is it.

19:54.634 --> 19:55.014
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

19:55.054 --> 19:56.334
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be delisted soon.

19:56.414 --> 19:57.775
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be delisted in six months anyway.

19:58.435 --> 20:01.337
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played the Warlords game as well, which was... I'm sorry.

20:01.357 --> 20:05.741
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little more fun with that because I remember the old school Warlords game, but they really kind of changed it.

20:06.581 --> 20:12.346
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can notice for yourself, play the new, because you can do the demo, play the evolved version versus the old version.

20:12.666 --> 20:14.507
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it works is kind of different.

20:14.867 --> 20:20.492
[SPEAKER_01]: The new version is more like Breakout, which, yeah, the old version was too, but the ways the castles were shaped were even different.

20:20.812 --> 20:23.834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, it plays a lot differently and not as fast.

20:24.134 --> 20:24.655
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.

20:24.835 --> 20:25.795
[SPEAKER_01]: No thanks, I think I'll skip it.

20:25.815 --> 20:26.116
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.

20:26.716 --> 20:35.245
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least it's only five bucks, and I bet Xbox Live is kind of fun, but I think Warlords is one of those games you best remember as something that was at Chuck E. Cheese when you were a kid.

20:36.266 --> 20:39.409
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly, this one I'm noticing about a lot of the retro titles on Xbox Live.

20:39.469 --> 20:43.413
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but Discs of Tron.

20:44.034 --> 20:48.318
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of disappointing to play on Xbox Live, because that was one of those games that's best left in my childhood.

20:49.099 --> 20:49.540
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you do?

20:50.253 --> 20:54.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into tonight's news.

20:54.977 --> 21:04.284
[SPEAKER_01]: Really only a little bit of housekeeping tonight, and that is that if you are unaware, our 6th anniversary show is coming up in 3 weeks, if you can believe it or not.

21:04.684 --> 21:11.630
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio started on June 23rd of 2002, and so in about 3 weeks we're going to be looking at our 6th anniversary show.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.872
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no idea what to do.

21:14.352 --> 21:14.892
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:37.611 --> 21:49.285
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll see because the show has always been about the chatters and the listeners and interacting so why not we'll be your monkeys this anniversary within reason I mean if you know the suggestion is you know naked show that's probably not going to happen

21:49.730 --> 21:53.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Actdeft, we're not having a fuck show until we don't say we are.

21:53.673 --> 21:54.093
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

21:54.133 --> 21:55.434
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck show is a surprise.

21:55.974 --> 21:58.155
[SPEAKER_01]: First rule about fuck show, you don't talk about fuck show.

21:58.456 --> 22:01.978
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't really made up any other rules beyond that because we have to have rules for that.

22:02.158 --> 22:02.398
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

22:03.759 --> 22:05.420
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody has to moderate and all that fun stuff.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.201
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll plan it.

22:06.221 --> 22:06.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.

22:07.061 --> 22:08.562
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the first thing.

22:08.602 --> 22:10.623
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.224
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.

22:12.978 --> 22:15.059
[SPEAKER_01]: and Brad from PodCulture says, drunk fuck show.

22:15.599 --> 22:18.520
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get drunk right now because of everything else going on.

22:19.280 --> 22:19.561
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

22:20.361 --> 22:20.741
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow.

22:21.421 --> 22:22.722
[SPEAKER_05]: We could give you some LSD.

22:23.822 --> 22:24.943
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could probably smoke pot.

22:24.963 --> 22:25.463
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be okay.

22:25.483 --> 22:26.603
[SPEAKER_05]: You could.

22:26.623 --> 22:27.824
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot's not bad.

22:27.844 --> 22:28.824
[SPEAKER_01]: No, drugs are bad, okay?

22:29.544 --> 22:30.305
[SPEAKER_01]: Drugs are bad, okay?

22:30.905 --> 22:31.225
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

22:31.945 --> 22:32.286
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

22:32.926 --> 22:34.126
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some gaming news.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.887
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, Loki, save the show from drug talk.

22:36.189 --> 22:51.661
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this week there was an event being held in France for Ubi Days 2008, where they were showing off a bunch of their titles, and one that they showed off only in trailer form, and it was kind of at the closing of the conference.

22:52.282 --> 22:52.402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

22:53.903 --> 22:54.923
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond Good and Evil 2.

22:55.564 --> 23:00.825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being reimagined now for the next-gen consoles, and I'd imagine probably the PC as well.

23:01.466 --> 23:05.707
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a little teaser trailer, which you can see Uncle Page.

23:06.147 --> 23:07.708
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

23:07.848 --> 23:08.328
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool.

23:08.488 --> 23:13.450
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really played the first Beyond Good and Evil, so I don't really know what to expect from this.

23:13.530 --> 23:21.432
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond Good and Evil is one of those really cult hits kind of things, so I know there's a lot of people very excited about this, because I think a lot of people didn't think it would ever happen.

23:21.972 --> 23:22.473
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

23:22.913 --> 23:23.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good, though.

23:24.793 --> 23:25.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

23:25.894 --> 23:28.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll probably find out more about this during E3.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.457
[SPEAKER_01]: That little pig guy thing kind of scared me, just so you know.

23:33.477 --> 23:34.477
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the pictures of that?

23:34.697 --> 23:34.918
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

23:34.958 --> 23:35.858
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very scary.

23:35.878 --> 23:36.498
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Uncle Paige.

23:36.818 --> 23:37.799
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that scared me.

23:39.311 --> 23:43.733
[SPEAKER_01]: Also coming to the PlayStation pretty soon because Beyond Good and Evil 2 is PS3, right?

23:44.214 --> 23:45.394
[SPEAKER_01]: All the next-gen systems, right?

23:45.414 --> 23:45.934
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.

23:46.054 --> 23:52.337
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also coming to the PlayStation 3 sometime eventually will be Home, Sony Home.

23:52.758 --> 23:56.839
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ubisoft has announced that they are going to be doing something special for Home.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.721
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to be doing one of their events online.

24:01.302 --> 24:01.782
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.

24:03.403 --> 24:09.446
[SPEAKER_01]: In the PlayStation Home media and events space, they're going to be showing off all these new Ubisoft titles.

24:10.027 --> 24:14.029
[SPEAKER_01]: Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, HAWX, Hawks or whatever.

24:14.389 --> 24:15.370
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 4.

24:15.710 --> 24:16.550
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.092
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only get there if you have a closed beta account.

24:19.112 --> 24:19.972
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 4?

24:21.113 --> 24:21.613
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.

24:21.653 --> 24:23.014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not an Ubisoft title.

24:23.054 --> 24:24.095
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that's on the list.

24:24.835 --> 24:26.496
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe that's sharing the space.

24:26.536 --> 24:26.936
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

24:27.657 --> 24:27.797
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

24:28.530 --> 24:31.932
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever, there are these other games at least as well that are going to be in the space.

24:32.712 --> 24:38.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool, yeah, because I know right now it's only open, or I should say it's closed beta right now, so those are the only people that are able to enjoy that.

24:39.256 --> 24:45.600
[SPEAKER_02]: And prior to this, they did a recreation of the Sony, I think they call it PlayStation Day.

24:46.180 --> 24:54.645
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of showing what it would look like for future events, which I think is pretty cool that they have this whole interactive thing going on.

24:54.985 --> 24:57.287
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a different way to approach it.

24:58.027 --> 24:59.028
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of interesting.

24:59.068 --> 25:07.715
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, since the rest of us can't go to E3 anymore because we're not in the Cool Kids Club, you know, we could go to E3 in home, which I think is kind of interesting.

25:07.815 --> 25:12.379
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the more I think of it, the more I don't really care that we're in the good graces of publishers.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.342
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we get to say whatever we want in the show.

25:16.962 --> 25:17.683
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind either.

25:18.383 --> 25:19.384
[SPEAKER_01]: So, screw it.

25:20.205 --> 25:21.226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the hell with them.

25:22.527 --> 25:25.089
[SPEAKER_06]: We can say something sucks as much as we want to.

25:25.189 --> 25:25.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

25:27.273 --> 25:29.739
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to review Metal Gear Solid 4 early, we can.

25:30.741 --> 25:34.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake is old.

25:34.630 --> 25:36.856
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about the hard drive space all we want.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's probably why we don't have advanced screeners.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably why we don't get advanced screeners.

25:42.525 --> 25:45.007
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming out though on the Japanese PlayStation Store.

25:45.247 --> 25:45.427
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

25:45.447 --> 25:46.928
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on the 26th of June.

25:47.408 --> 25:50.170
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I read this, my response was LOL what?

25:51.971 --> 25:53.232
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a gardening game.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.454
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Shikitei.

25:56.314 --> 26:03.119
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically you can go outside and plant trees and plant flowers and watch them grow.

26:05.415 --> 26:26.948
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's supposed to be um 1600 yen and it's supposed to be relaxing for the older gamer there's no word if we're ever getting it but i i was just like what and it made me think about the saturn game that came out that was all audio and it came with seeds and he was and it was supposed to help your plant grow

26:28.615 --> 26:31.496
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so correct me if I'm wrong.

26:31.936 --> 26:32.216
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.

26:32.276 --> 26:37.919
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are saying now that I can use my PlayStation 3 to watch the grass grow.

26:38.159 --> 26:38.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

26:40.339 --> 26:46.282
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even get the benefit of insects or animals to scamper through your garden and eat the leaves off of your petunias.

26:46.902 --> 26:47.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

26:48.122 --> 26:49.923
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can plant cherry trees.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just go plant real trees?

26:53.086 --> 26:54.347
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the beauty of video games

27:15.126 --> 27:15.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

27:15.546 --> 27:18.207
[SPEAKER_02]: How about spend the 1600 yen on something better?

27:19.428 --> 27:21.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like tacos.

27:23.029 --> 27:24.450
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

27:24.470 --> 27:31.832
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you can find tacos in Japan, but if I had 1600 yen, I would just go be buying maybe some Anpan or something.

27:32.233 --> 27:32.933
[SPEAKER_06]: Anpan is delicious.

27:32.953 --> 27:35.074
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a dream game brainstorm.

27:35.894 --> 27:38.135
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of video game could they make about tacos?

27:39.571 --> 27:40.572
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

28:06.713 --> 28:07.874
[SPEAKER_06]: I love chicken sauce tacos.

28:07.895 --> 28:08.675
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacos are not lame.

28:08.876 --> 28:09.597
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's lame?

28:09.637 --> 28:10.157
[SPEAKER_01]: You're lame.

28:10.337 --> 28:11.559
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacos are not lame.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.361
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's lame?

28:13.801 --> 28:14.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Your butt.

28:14.502 --> 28:15.243
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's lame?

28:15.263 --> 28:17.546
[SPEAKER_02]: A gardening game on any system.

28:18.207 --> 28:20.369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Viva Pinata minus the pinatas.

28:21.290 --> 28:22.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the Viva.

28:23.393 --> 28:24.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Viva, yes.

28:26.277 --> 28:27.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinata Verte.

28:27.838 --> 28:30.739
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to cover that for the, what the hell are they thinking?

28:31.019 --> 28:33.421
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's only in Japan, right?

28:33.481 --> 28:37.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's a neat idea that they're putting out a game that's different.

28:37.623 --> 28:38.323
[SPEAKER_02]: For old people!

28:38.343 --> 28:41.445
[SPEAKER_02]: For old people that will buy practically anything, I guess.

28:42.845 --> 28:45.487
[SPEAKER_02]: But 1,600 yen seems... It was 1,600 yen?

28:45.567 --> 28:46.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

28:46.867 --> 28:48.108
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems kind of expensive.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like seven bucks.

28:50.549 --> 28:51.190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still expensive.

28:51.210 --> 28:52.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why am I saying seven bucks?

28:52.931 --> 28:53.251
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

28:54.953 --> 28:55.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe $16.50.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.901
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like $15 about, right?

28:58.921 --> 28:59.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's lame.

29:01.513 --> 29:02.593
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have tea agrees.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.775
[SPEAKER_01]: Taco Time would be an amazing name for a game.

29:04.815 --> 29:05.555
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly.

29:07.116 --> 29:12.980
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't officially add anything to the Dream Games list yet, but be thinking about Taco Time.

29:13.521 --> 29:14.701
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a game in there somewhere.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.102
[SPEAKER_06]: More tacos, less drugs.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.485
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a remake of Burger Time and add other food to it.

29:19.745 --> 29:21.006
[SPEAKER_02]: That you create other things.

29:21.326 --> 29:23.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only burgers, but other meals and stuff.

29:24.048 --> 29:25.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, bored now.

29:25.969 --> 29:27.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because it was a bad idea anyway.

29:27.750 --> 29:28.911
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's your Taco Time.

29:28.951 --> 29:29.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad idea.

29:29.411 --> 29:30.272
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Dream Game.

29:31.072 --> 29:31.273
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

29:31.933 --> 29:32.994
[SPEAKER_05]: Action Bastard the game.

29:34.215 --> 29:34.316
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

29:34.556 --> 29:35.497
[SPEAKER_02]: No Dream Games tonight.

29:36.157 --> 29:42.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, one game that's not being included in the new firmware for the PS3 is Taco Time.

29:43.184 --> 29:45.266
[SPEAKER_02]: But some other things are going to be added in there.

29:45.706 --> 29:50.471
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all, of course, rumors, but there's a lot of, I don't know...

29:51.693 --> 29:53.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Evidence to point towards it.

29:54.314 --> 30:08.862
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rumor is that they're adding both the in-game cross-media bar, which is something that should have been there, I don't know, from the start, and trophies, which, you know, is Sony's way of saying, hey, we like achievements, but how can we get around a lawsuit?

30:09.623 --> 30:11.824
[SPEAKER_02]: So those will be coming very soon.

30:12.745 --> 30:16.086
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they have been spotted already in...

30:17.427 --> 30:45.864
[SPEAKER_02]: a video showing the new Bioshock for Playstation 3 apparently a member of MaxConsoleForums has posted some images and video during Bioshock that they found so interesting but either way you know these are coming because you know they've announced this previously it's just a matter of time but then again it could get delayed forever like Home has and everything else Sony related so

30:48.357 --> 30:48.697
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

30:49.218 --> 30:49.498
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

30:49.518 --> 30:50.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is a good idea?

30:50.539 --> 30:51.800
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something PlayStation needs?

30:52.041 --> 30:52.401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

30:52.601 --> 30:56.825
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I know achievements have gotten me to play games I probably wouldn't normally play.

30:57.085 --> 30:59.227
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's only a good thing for them.

31:00.308 --> 31:02.850
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I mean, sure, we'll get over it.

31:02.971 --> 31:07.054
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, since we haven't gotten over it yet, I still think it's a cheap ripoff.

31:07.194 --> 31:09.757
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, more power to them, I guess.

31:11.872 --> 31:18.897
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I got a private message from Cheeseburger in chat who's suggesting that Taco Time could be like Taco Mama instead of Cooking Mama.

31:18.937 --> 31:19.457
[SPEAKER_01]: Taco Mama.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.859
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be Cooking Mama Junk Food Edition.

31:21.979 --> 31:24.501
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, they do have a restaurant called Taco Time.

31:25.261 --> 31:28.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have Tia saying, is everyone else seriously missing the sexual euphemism?

31:29.504 --> 31:30.745
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not at all.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.526
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be Fish Taco Time.

31:33.927 --> 31:35.268
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the bonus stage.

31:37.890 --> 31:38.470
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, forget it.

31:38.510 --> 31:39.531
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough about tacos.

31:39.911 --> 31:39.991
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

31:42.262 --> 31:44.785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually an in-joke amongst me and some other people.

31:45.866 --> 31:46.226
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

31:46.486 --> 31:46.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

31:49.729 --> 31:50.971
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're talking about muffins.

31:51.071 --> 31:51.671
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that?

31:51.892 --> 31:53.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Muffins are also sexual.

31:54.234 --> 31:55.155
[SPEAKER_05]: Muffins!

31:55.815 --> 31:56.516
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana muffins.

31:59.279 --> 32:00.200
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood muffins.

32:00.620 --> 32:01.401
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood muffin?

32:02.081 --> 32:02.442
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

32:02.802 --> 32:05.004
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the YouTube thing about... Forget it.

32:06.205 --> 32:06.546
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow...

32:08.530 --> 32:14.271
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation 3 game End War is going to be getting some very interesting types of controls.

32:14.771 --> 32:20.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Gesture-activated commands are coming soon to the End War game, which is a Tom Clancy game.

32:21.153 --> 32:29.554
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, you actually use the PlayStation Eye to do it, and you can wave your hands, like if you wave your hand underneath the camera, then you get the game's overhead map.

32:30.475 --> 32:31.895
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I don't know, it's kind of...

32:32.535 --> 32:33.837
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

32:43.314 --> 32:45.595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why Par Par Paradise really took off, huh?

32:45.675 --> 32:52.476
[SPEAKER_01]: Strangely enough, nothing about a 360 equivalent because there is that whole vision camera, but no word yet about that.

32:52.496 --> 32:57.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the vision camera sucks and the PlayStation Eye is supposed to be a little bit more detailed.

32:57.838 --> 33:02.139
[SPEAKER_02]: How much different are they really besides maybe resolution?

33:02.679 --> 33:03.059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

33:03.219 --> 33:06.520
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my vision camera hasn't been used ever since I got it.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.861
[SPEAKER_02]: I took my picture with it and I was about as far as I went.

33:09.981 --> 33:12.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I tried playing Totem Ball and then that sucked too.

33:13.063 --> 33:15.584
[SPEAKER_02]: But the PlayStation Eye, I guess it's a good use of it.

33:15.804 --> 33:21.827
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'd rather see those, you know, other games that they had that they were showing off little tech demos for.

33:22.367 --> 33:33.292
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, I mean, if you want some crappy use for a $30 camera, then sure, let's just make it so I can wave my hand under the camera instead of, I don't know, pushing a button.

33:35.029 --> 33:35.650
[SPEAKER_02]: What's easier?

33:35.930 --> 33:39.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, if we're going to be lazy here, pushing a button or waving your hand?

33:39.933 --> 33:40.873
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pushing the button.

33:41.994 --> 33:45.997
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, this is still in development and may not actually make the final cut of the game.

33:46.017 --> 33:47.918
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that's being played with right now.

33:47.938 --> 33:51.420
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think it'd be gesture control, like flipping off the enemy or something.

33:51.460 --> 34:01.347
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now if they had it where you're actually... Because the article referred the control to being similar to Total Recall.

34:01.747 --> 34:02.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not Total Recall...

34:03.456 --> 34:04.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Minority Report.

34:04.257 --> 34:05.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell?

34:05.978 --> 34:06.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrong movie there.

34:06.618 --> 34:14.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if it was more like that where you're actually using your hands to move a map around and stuff like that, that'd be kind of cool.

34:14.623 --> 34:18.065
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to wave your hand to bring up a map is kind of stupid.

34:20.462 --> 34:33.412
[SPEAKER_01]: Sully907 is commenting on the previous story about the firmware once firmware 2.4 comes out the PlayStation Network becomes on par with Xbox Live Xbox Live is still slightly better but not enough to justify $50 anymore agree or disagree?

34:35.357 --> 34:42.381
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't agree, because I still think as far as content that's on there, there's a lot less content on the PlayStation Network.

34:42.881 --> 34:55.288
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, download content's a little on par, especially with some of the games that are coming out in both systems, but as far as original games and new PlayStation Network games, there really hasn't been that many that have come out.

34:55.328 --> 34:57.529
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not every week like Xbox Live Arcade.

34:58.070 --> 35:01.872
[SPEAKER_02]: True, although I do think maybe it's time for Xbox Live to get a little price cut.

35:02.612 --> 35:02.973
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

35:03.333 --> 35:03.593
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

35:03.613 --> 35:04.974
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do tend to update a lot more.

35:05.034 --> 35:07.557
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should, too, especially since they're advertising on there.

35:07.697 --> 35:09.278
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

35:09.819 --> 35:12.101
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay a monthly subscription to watch ads.

35:12.121 --> 35:14.343
[SPEAKER_01]: When has that ever stopped other games from doing the same thing?

35:14.403 --> 35:15.104
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

35:15.624 --> 35:17.566
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're talking about motion-based games in chat.

35:17.586 --> 35:20.149
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about Power, Power, Power Dice and all this stuff.

35:20.209 --> 35:21.050
[SPEAKER_01]: Crunky Boy Jr.

35:21.110 --> 35:26.034
[SPEAKER_01]: says they should have a spin-off of the Wii Fit hula hoop game where you put symbols in your ass.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.123
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure how that works, but okay.

35:30.204 --> 35:36.568
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Wii Fit and the hula hoop game, I doubt you've seen this, DarkSakura, but Loki, did you see the YouTube this week?

35:37.049 --> 35:38.570
[SPEAKER_01]: It was posted on Dig.

35:39.050 --> 35:43.333
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some guy taping his girlfriend playing the Wii Fit hula hoop game.

35:43.613 --> 35:44.213
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.

35:44.253 --> 35:48.536
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a nice-looking gal, and she had a nice little booty on her, right?

35:49.937 --> 35:51.098
[SPEAKER_01]: She was wearing nothing but panties.

35:51.398 --> 35:52.759
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she was wearing panties and a T-shirt.

35:54.600 --> 36:17.971
[SPEAKER_01]: and the thing is that while she's playing the hula hoop game the boyfriend like zooms in on her butt and put it on the internet for everybody to see and now it's everywhere and at the very end of the video like the guy puts the camera on himself and he gives one of those like yeah type of looks if you haven't seen it it's hilarious I'm gonna find it I can't believe you guys haven't seen it I'm gonna find it

36:18.291 --> 36:19.771
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it in studio after the next story.

36:19.791 --> 36:26.513
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really look at Dig anymore because, well, especially their gaming topics, I've already seen most of that, step by time.

36:26.553 --> 36:31.395
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of crap on there, but there's some decent stories that sometimes slip under the radar, like this one.

36:31.455 --> 36:34.355
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll find it on YouTube for you guys while we cover the next story.

36:34.556 --> 36:35.496
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that decent?

36:35.536 --> 36:36.616
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds indecent.

36:37.216 --> 36:38.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have something more decent.

36:38.517 --> 36:43.638
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the PAL PSN update of stuff-ness.

36:44.618 --> 36:45.579
[SPEAKER_06]: They got something good.

36:46.119 --> 36:46.779
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, one good thing.

36:47.799 --> 36:53.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix MatchingService.com

37:05.147 --> 37:31.214
[SPEAKER_06]: it's £6.99 over there so everyone download it they also have Rayman on the PS3 and PC store for PSP for £3.49 also Medieval Resurrection for PSP out for £14.99 and Go Sudoku packs at £1.99 or you can download the whole thing for £4.99 and the Army of Two Veteran Map Pack

37:32.230 --> 37:37.357
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Prince of Persia wallpaper, like you care, but hey.

37:38.639 --> 37:39.180
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all.

37:40.582 --> 37:43.846
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess there are quite a few things coming to PlayStation Network after all.

37:43.906 --> 37:44.227
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knew?

37:44.948 --> 37:47.131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, late at least.

37:47.491 --> 37:47.772
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

37:49.099 --> 37:50.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Better eventually than not at all.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Search for a user on YouTube.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.460
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Tinsley Advertising.

37:53.560 --> 37:54.220
[SPEAKER_01]: T-I-N-S-L-E-Y Advertising.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.040
[SPEAKER_01]: All one word there.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.201
[SPEAKER_01]: Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.341
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the girl.

38:19.861 --> 38:21.101
[SPEAKER_01]: She's starting to play Wii Fit.

38:23.142 --> 38:24.042
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at that.

38:25.543 --> 38:29.624
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and she's kind of like, you can tell she's kind of one of those cute nerdy girls too.

38:29.664 --> 38:32.485
[SPEAKER_01]: She's wearing glasses and got a little ponytail, right?

38:32.985 --> 38:36.626
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she has this little booty on her.

38:36.706 --> 38:37.787
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's playing Wii Fit.

38:37.807 --> 38:39.607
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, Loki?

38:42.909 --> 38:43.809
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.309
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki gave thumbs up.

38:45.549 --> 38:49.071
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry we don't have just the TV tonight so you can see how Loki gave the thumbs up there.

38:49.391 --> 38:51.171
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, offensive or funny?

38:52.632 --> 38:55.193
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm apathetic towards it.

38:55.453 --> 38:55.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Ambivalent.

38:56.073 --> 38:56.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Ambivalent would work.

38:56.873 --> 38:58.134
[SPEAKER_02]: It was her idea.

38:58.254 --> 38:59.314
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was.

38:59.534 --> 39:02.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know you were filming me.

39:02.495 --> 39:06.016
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to the end of the video just because you have to see this guy when he looks at the camera.

39:06.637 --> 39:08.537
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah.

39:10.118 --> 39:10.398
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

39:11.385 --> 39:15.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you put the link in the chat room, so.

39:15.968 --> 39:16.688
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

39:17.349 --> 39:17.769
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look.

39:19.770 --> 39:22.532
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now we're going to get a whole bunch of the chat room going.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.433
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm not even going to look at the chat room.

39:25.454 --> 39:25.654
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

39:25.774 --> 39:30.236
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Actdeft is questioning my sexuality because, you know, I'm the gay one on the show, but I like girls.

39:30.256 --> 39:32.718
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have an appreciation for the female form.

39:32.758 --> 39:37.181
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the, you know, I can see why people like this video.

39:37.221 --> 39:38.842
[SPEAKER_02]: She's taking it as a compliment.

39:38.942 --> 39:39.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

39:39.762 --> 39:42.584
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they releasing it in Africa?

39:42.624 --> 39:42.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

40:08.228 --> 40:11.249
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume so, since that's not Europe.

40:11.869 --> 40:13.630
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, maybe.

40:14.771 --> 40:17.752
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really bad if Africa was excluded from their own game.

40:18.492 --> 40:20.053
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to run over the animals.

40:20.073 --> 40:21.873
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way I will buy this game.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.114
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need to do a new Jumbo Safari.

40:27.116 --> 40:33.378
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, if you ever wanted to go to a virtual safari, then Africa is the game for you.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be coming out in August.

40:37.122 --> 40:38.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know what Africa is yet?

40:39.523 --> 40:40.283
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything about it?

40:40.363 --> 40:41.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it a taking pictures game?

40:42.703 --> 40:43.183
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

40:43.363 --> 40:45.444
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Snap, but not with Pokemon?

40:48.344 --> 40:48.704
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

40:48.744 --> 40:51.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at the other games that have come out that have been very similar.

40:51.545 --> 40:52.165
[SPEAKER_02]: Endless Ocean.

40:53.185 --> 40:54.106
[SPEAKER_02]: No one bought that.

40:55.466 --> 40:57.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild Earth African Safari.

40:58.526 --> 40:59.387
[SPEAKER_02]: No one bought that.

41:01.227 --> 41:02.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Snap.

41:02.647 --> 41:04.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time ago, people bought it because it's Pokemon.

41:05.268 --> 41:05.948
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's fun!

41:06.857 --> 41:07.418
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41:23.876 --> 41:29.619
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a Sakura Taisen game, I think, that came out that had a bunch of weird, bizarre shit in it.

41:29.699 --> 41:37.665
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good thing is, though, if you are in Europe and you really, really, really want to play Africa... Region free, right?

41:37.825 --> 41:38.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

41:38.525 --> 41:39.906
[SPEAKER_02]: So just import the US one.

41:40.206 --> 41:40.707
Africa.

41:40.947 --> 41:41.908
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an HDTV.

41:42.968 --> 41:43.489
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

41:44.709 --> 41:45.090
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

41:45.690 --> 41:46.190
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

41:48.092 --> 41:48.572
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

41:49.304 --> 41:50.545
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioshock Bioshock

42:11.898 --> 42:18.605
[SPEAKER_01]: New features and content that will make this a must-have game for its new audience as well as for those who enjoyed it on other platforms.

42:18.945 --> 42:22.809
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that means additional levels or weapons or other types of things.

42:23.750 --> 42:26.773
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I hope it's not multiplayer finally or something, you know?

42:27.053 --> 42:29.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine if PlayStation 3 had like the Deathmatch exclusive?

42:29.876 --> 42:30.036
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

42:30.516 --> 42:31.916
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they won't do that.

42:32.677 --> 42:34.717
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that games and mechanics were built for that.

42:34.737 --> 42:41.079
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, if they were talking about new content in there, I bet you it's the download content that was already available on the Xbox and PC.

42:42.079 --> 42:44.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a bonus level or something, right?

42:45.340 --> 42:46.480
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think they're going to do that.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe another difficulty or something like that.

42:48.321 --> 42:51.502
[SPEAKER_01]: What would make me want to re-buy it if I already had it on the other systems?

42:51.582 --> 42:53.682
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there was some really good extras.

42:54.302 --> 42:56.123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're talking about a cheap game here.

42:57.312 --> 42:57.552
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

42:57.572 --> 42:58.352
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the game will be cheap.

42:58.372 --> 42:59.473
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that'll be the kicker.

42:59.493 --> 42:59.733
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

42:59.753 --> 43:16.036
[SPEAKER_02]: What they could do, they could do like some of the other cheap stuff that some other first person shooters have done like a survival mode where they just keep sending enemies at you and see how long you can survive or I don't know more plasmids I guess they could add to it.

43:17.677 --> 43:21.218
[SPEAKER_01]: WhatUpG in chat is asking when is Bioshock 2 due out?

43:21.258 --> 43:22.738
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know anything about Bioshock 2?

43:23.218 --> 43:23.458
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

43:23.758 --> 43:24.478
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 09 holiday.

43:24.498 --> 43:24.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

43:27.950 --> 43:28.230
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

43:29.491 --> 43:30.432
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see what happens.

43:32.093 --> 43:35.556
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still shaking my head over this next story.

43:36.177 --> 43:36.377
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

43:36.877 --> 43:40.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people are so gullible.

43:42.345 --> 43:51.891
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anyone has seen the Fallout 3 screenshots that were out that shows basically Washington turned into a big, you know, soot-covered smoking crater.

43:53.452 --> 44:00.977
[SPEAKER_06]: But an intelligence contractor called SITE, S-I-T-E, Intel Group...

44:02.657 --> 44:06.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought that they were Al-Qaeda images, you know, propaganda.

44:07.379 --> 44:10.499
[SPEAKER_06]: And a few, I guess, anti-U.S.

44:11.240 --> 44:19.862
[SPEAKER_06]: sites posted them up, you know, and had chat logs and everything about it, saying that this was their big dream to see or whatever.

44:20.703 --> 44:22.506
[SPEAKER_06]: There were screens for Fallout 3.

44:22.546 --> 44:26.472
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't heard any word back officially.

44:28.155 --> 44:34.445
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I did think was funny in this article on Kotaku is that Sight is based in Bethesda.

44:36.337 --> 44:42.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's actually terrorists are using those images from Fallout 3 or supposed terrorists.

44:42.621 --> 44:44.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think they're just affiliated sites.

44:44.682 --> 44:47.824
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're actually... I think they're just like terrorist fanboys or something.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrorist fanboys?

44:50.705 --> 44:59.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, any political faction is gonna have their little follower, so... And just to kind of go back a few... Well, it's not even really a story, but...

45:00.331 --> 45:04.616
[SPEAKER_02]: That YouTube that you were talking about there, apparently there were some comments on the dig for it.

45:05.256 --> 45:13.485
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tinsley Advertising actually replied back and said, Sorry guys, I got on our dig front page and well, my girlfriend found out and she's a tiny bit upset.

45:13.886 --> 45:20.693
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cute and it actually, or it was done with good intentions if she ever doubted how hot she is.

45:21.897 --> 45:24.239
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 1 million views on that YouTube, though.

45:24.559 --> 45:28.282
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's an internet star, at least her buddy is.

45:28.302 --> 45:30.123
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because you never see her face.

45:30.924 --> 45:33.446
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine walking by her on the street?

45:33.806 --> 45:35.067
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do I know you from?

45:35.107 --> 45:35.988
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do I know you from?

45:36.048 --> 45:38.009
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as she's leaving, I remember!

45:42.273 --> 45:42.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

45:43.554 --> 45:43.914
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

45:44.654 --> 45:48.978
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of, you know, if Dan did that, I'd have to smack him.

45:50.057 --> 45:56.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Amaze Satsuma in chat says, I would buy Bioshock again if it came with the living Big Daddy than just the statue.

45:57.101 --> 45:57.661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

45:58.702 --> 46:02.624
[SPEAKER_01]: About the Fallout things, though, I saw that picture of the whole Washington, D.C.

46:02.684 --> 46:07.667
[SPEAKER_01]: looking destroyed thing, and it is pretty scary how realistic some of these games are getting.

46:07.687 --> 46:10.789
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I mean, remember Independence Day?

46:11.786 --> 46:12.627
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:35.899 --> 46:36.640
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:07.878 --> 47:24.873
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I thought was funny Okay, the chatroom agrees it was 1995 So, I mean, it's not like we haven't seen these horrific images, quote-unquote, before But, you know, at least when you're watching a movie trailer, you know you're watching a movie trailer But when you see these random images on the internet of Washington, D.C.

47:24.913 --> 47:29.757
[SPEAKER_01]: looking all destroyed It's kind of scary if you don't know what it is, you know what I mean?

47:31.440 --> 47:31.740
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

47:33.021 --> 47:38.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this game may not be as cool as Fallout 3, but definitely one that I'm looking forward to.

47:38.386 --> 47:40.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Splatterhouse, the brand new remake.

47:41.249 --> 47:43.732
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some interesting features that they've been talking about.

47:44.372 --> 47:53.041
[SPEAKER_02]: One of which is the fact that your limbs can basically be taken off, but after a short bit they will actually regrow back.

47:53.701 --> 47:56.504
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool and very detailed.

47:56.824 --> 48:03.750
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess instead of like a health system, your skin will start coming off, then your flesh, and then your bones will break.

48:04.271 --> 48:06.413
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that stuff will kind of just grow right back.

48:06.913 --> 48:07.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds lovely.

48:07.974 --> 48:08.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

48:08.775 --> 48:09.595
[SPEAKER_02]: And then apparently...

48:11.309 --> 48:18.695
[SPEAKER_02]: The Killzone script writer, Gordon Rennie, and I guess he did Judge Dredd and the Necronauts comics.

48:19.555 --> 48:22.938
[SPEAKER_02]: He's signed on to do the story for this game as well.

48:23.058 --> 48:24.859
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

48:26.200 --> 48:30.183
[SPEAKER_02]: And the graphics on it so far look pretty good and very bloody.

48:31.684 --> 48:32.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like the original.

48:33.045 --> 48:34.026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, violence!

48:35.027 --> 48:35.808
[SPEAKER_06]: I like violence.

48:36.528 --> 48:37.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Violence is fantastic.

48:38.229 --> 48:38.910
[SPEAKER_06]: And sells stuff.

48:39.258 --> 48:41.579
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura should get in panties and do the hula hoop game No

49:08.223 --> 49:09.825
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding, I'm not actually going to do that.

49:12.227 --> 49:13.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Little creepy!

49:13.969 --> 49:14.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Little creepy!

49:15.290 --> 49:17.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on.

49:17.513 --> 49:19.375
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about Metal Gear Solid 4.

49:19.435 --> 49:23.839
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of referenced this earlier because Konami's telling some people to put a lid on it.

49:25.404 --> 49:28.926
[SPEAKER_01]: Minor, minor spoilers here from Metal Gear Solid 4.

49:29.306 --> 49:33.187
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't want to know, skip ahead in the podcast by about a minute.

49:33.207 --> 49:34.548
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are just minor spoilers.

49:34.628 --> 49:35.028
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.

49:35.568 --> 49:36.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.

49:36.809 --> 49:44.791
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosemary from Metal Gear Solid 2 is supposed to make an appearance, as well as Mei Ling from Metal Gear Solid the original.

49:45.112 --> 49:47.733
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to be some characters in Metal Gear Solid 4.

49:48.213 --> 49:54.175
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are looking forward to being reunited with some of your favorite females from Metal Gear history, there you go.

49:56.508 --> 49:59.591
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can convince Mei Ling to get in her panties and play Wii Fit.

49:59.631 --> 49:59.951
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

50:01.512 --> 50:01.733
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

50:01.933 --> 50:03.114
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to write a letter to Konami.

50:03.823 --> 50:04.424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

50:27.383 --> 50:29.665
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually get it, I think, from PlayAsia for $28.

50:31.686 --> 50:37.230
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are spoilers on the track listing, so if you don't want spoilers, then don't get it.

50:38.311 --> 50:43.655
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you do get the limited edition of the game, you will get a copy of the soundtrack too.

50:46.004 --> 50:53.547
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, for Bomani fans, fans of Konami's music game series, I did notice one familiar name showed up on the soundtrack.

50:54.267 --> 50:57.108
[SPEAKER_01]: Soda Fujimori apparently contributed to a couple tracks too.

50:58.088 --> 51:00.509
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did some of the remixes in Beatmania 2DX.

51:00.669 --> 51:03.150
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little Konami connection there.

51:03.290 --> 51:03.790
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

51:04.690 --> 51:05.791
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami connection.

51:06.131 --> 51:06.331
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

51:07.487 --> 51:08.428
[SPEAKER_01]: One big happy family.

51:08.628 --> 51:14.816
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of do that though with a lot of their soundtracks, especially like Contra and stuff has a lot of Konami artists on there.

51:15.717 --> 51:18.841
[SPEAKER_02]: You always see Akira and Suda.

51:20.140 --> 51:20.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Hulk Smash!

51:49.669 --> 51:51.370
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the only reason I'd buy this game.

51:51.390 --> 51:54.973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to not suck that bad, but, you know, we'll have to see.

51:55.834 --> 52:01.858
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, of course, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360, which looks pretty awesome.

52:02.899 --> 52:08.383
[SPEAKER_02]: And also coming out on practically everything, Lego Indiana Jones.

52:09.063 --> 52:10.264
[SPEAKER_02]: So that looks pretty cool.

52:10.744 --> 52:14.747
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kung Fu Panda, yet another movie tie-in.

52:15.588 --> 52:17.249
[SPEAKER_06]: The trailer for that looks kind of funny, actually.

52:18.459 --> 52:25.784
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I do and I don't want a game called Kung Fu Panda because on one hand it sounds really awesome and on one hand it sounds like a lot could go wrong.

52:28.086 --> 52:29.126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on a movie, right?

52:29.507 --> 52:30.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

52:31.548 --> 52:36.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the Wii, there's Cabela's Trophy Bucks, which looks like crap.

52:37.632 --> 52:40.635
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PSP, Hot Shots Golf Open T2.

52:41.795 --> 52:46.579
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, Summon Night Twin Age, which looks like a pretty cool Atlus RPG.

52:48.109 --> 52:51.613
[SPEAKER_02]: God of War PSP Bundle Grid on PS3, Xbox 360, PC The Grid

53:07.097 --> 53:07.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

53:08.358 --> 53:09.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well this game looks awesome.

53:10.059 --> 53:12.081
[SPEAKER_02]: This game's probably a lot better than The Grid.

53:13.302 --> 53:16.225
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am surprised we haven't seen that come to home consoles.

53:16.625 --> 53:17.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

53:17.746 --> 53:19.448
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they should make that for Xbox Live or something.

53:20.729 --> 53:21.890
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here.

53:21.910 --> 53:28.096
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, next Sunday, the Metallic Rose DS Lite will be coming out.

53:29.097 --> 53:30.138
[SPEAKER_05]: More colors, yay!

53:30.896 --> 53:33.418
[SPEAKER_02]: It's metallic pink-ish.

53:34.018 --> 53:34.859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's light-ish red.

53:35.580 --> 53:36.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

53:36.620 --> 53:39.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Replacing the normal pink.

53:41.604 --> 53:44.186
[SPEAKER_06]: So now everyone's going to go scramble over themselves to get that?

53:45.407 --> 53:46.708
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, yes.

53:47.209 --> 53:48.009
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait.

53:48.069 --> 53:48.510
[SPEAKER_01]: Special.

53:49.324 --> 53:52.546
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's talk about what's coming out in Japan overseas.

53:52.966 --> 54:02.013
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming out on June 5th for the Xbox 360, FIFA Street 3 as well as Ninja Gaiden 2 finally makes its way out in Japan on the Xbox 360.

54:02.513 --> 54:08.937
[SPEAKER_01]: Going over to the PlayStation 3, Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit makes its way as well as another port of FIFA Street 3.

54:10.218 --> 54:19.104
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we head on over to the Nintendo Wii, Fushugi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 3, Karakuri Yashiki no Nemuri Hime.

54:19.564 --> 54:23.049
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what that game is, but it's being made by Sega.

54:24.190 --> 54:25.932
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, it is an RPG.

54:25.972 --> 54:26.573
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all I know.

54:26.593 --> 54:28.335
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to see if we have any screenshots of this game.

54:28.735 --> 54:29.596
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly we do not.

54:29.636 --> 54:30.557
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have box art.

54:31.462 --> 54:34.865
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the guy looks like he has a little ferret as a companion.

54:35.185 --> 54:36.006
[SPEAKER_05]: Ferrets are great!

54:36.566 --> 54:37.727
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be a winner already.

54:37.767 --> 54:38.588
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the box art.

54:38.888 --> 54:39.629
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see.

54:39.869 --> 54:40.970
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Shirin the Wanderer.

54:41.310 --> 54:45.673
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a series that's ran since Saturn, I want to say.

54:45.954 --> 54:48.456
[SPEAKER_02]: They just had one that came out on the DS in the US.

54:48.956 --> 54:50.918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's Shirin the Wanderer 3 then.

54:51.098 --> 54:53.239
[SPEAKER_01]: But dude, he's got a little ferret companion on his shoulder.

54:53.259 --> 54:54.060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dungeon crawler.

54:54.260 --> 54:55.401
[SPEAKER_05]: So did Beastmaster.

54:55.461 --> 54:56.262
[SPEAKER_05]: He had two ferrets.

54:59.076 --> 55:01.236
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we endorse any game with ferrets in it.

55:01.576 --> 55:01.957
[SPEAKER_02]: That we do.

55:01.977 --> 55:02.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

55:02.697 --> 55:03.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, ferret!

55:04.657 --> 55:05.137
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying.

55:06.257 --> 55:07.538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the ferret is.

55:08.158 --> 55:08.518
[SPEAKER_01]: Hide it.

55:10.278 --> 55:10.658
[SPEAKER_06]: Give.

55:11.478 --> 55:11.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

55:12.538 --> 55:12.798
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

55:14.239 --> 55:14.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

55:14.639 --> 55:16.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to other Japanese releases.

55:16.259 --> 55:17.599
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it for the Nintendo Wii.

55:18.019 --> 55:21.440
[SPEAKER_01]: On the PlayStation 2, Ukuki is coming out.

55:21.920 --> 55:22.180
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

55:22.900 --> 55:23.500
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukuki.

55:24.261 --> 55:25.401
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say all the time.

55:25.641 --> 55:26.101
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukuki.

55:27.557 --> 55:28.538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's that.

55:28.598 --> 55:33.761
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an adventure game from Global A Entertainment.

55:34.222 --> 55:35.483
[SPEAKER_01]: And no screenshots or nothing.

55:35.523 --> 55:37.044
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you exactly what this game is.

55:37.084 --> 55:38.745
[SPEAKER_01]: But the box art is very artistic.

55:39.245 --> 55:40.706
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks kind of hand-drawn almost.

55:41.747 --> 55:42.147
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukuki.

55:43.889 --> 55:48.392
[SPEAKER_01]: Yamasod, DG World, Collaboration SP, Pachislot Ridge Racer.

55:50.201 --> 55:52.062
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine what that is.

55:52.142 --> 55:54.945
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just leave it at that.

55:55.525 --> 55:56.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Pachinko for Ridge Racer.

55:57.667 --> 55:59.209
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pachinko slot machine.

55:59.489 --> 56:02.592
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Nintendo DS, Deep Aquarium.

56:04.926 --> 56:06.026
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Deep Aquarium?

56:06.286 --> 56:07.467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what it sounds like.

56:07.507 --> 56:08.247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aquarium.

56:08.547 --> 56:09.187
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be damned.

56:09.347 --> 56:09.947
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

56:11.107 --> 56:12.208
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it looks like the bottom.

56:12.228 --> 56:14.988
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Titanic imagery there on the cover.

56:15.188 --> 56:16.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Titanic Aquarium.

56:17.569 --> 56:20.650
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you too can take care of your frozen corpses.

56:20.830 --> 56:24.310
[SPEAKER_01]: At first I thought it was an insane aquarium, but I was sadly mistaken.

56:24.831 --> 56:26.971
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing this week on the Sony PSP.

56:27.271 --> 56:28.791
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, PSP fans in Japan.

56:28.831 --> 56:30.872
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it for release dates overseas in Japan.

56:31.448 --> 56:39.936
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back to a different side of overseas, we have our UK release dates, and there's not a whole bunch of stuff, but hey, it's stuff still.

56:40.697 --> 56:43.260
[SPEAKER_06]: One that Rob would probably be interested in.

56:44.381 --> 56:48.645
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say really quick, HitStun has played that series of games, and it is a ferret.

56:53.142 --> 57:08.994
[SPEAKER_06]: On DS comes Etrian Odyssey, Everybody's Golf 2 for PSP, Lego Indiana Jones for a whole crap ton of everything else, Mass Effect on PC, Ninja Gaiden 2, Xbox 360, and Civilization Revolution for Rob.

57:12.574 --> 57:13.174
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray!

57:13.295 --> 57:19.659
[SPEAKER_01]: Except I heard it got pushed back here in America at the very last minute, so I'm wondering if the same thing didn't happen over in Japan.

57:19.679 --> 57:20.339
[SPEAKER_01]: It only got pushed back a week.

57:20.399 --> 57:21.040
[SPEAKER_01]: Or over in Europe.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.421
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the second week in July.

57:23.802 --> 57:24.642
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's more than a week.

57:24.662 --> 57:25.863
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be out the first week in June.

57:25.883 --> 57:27.865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be the first week in... Oh, yeah.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.366
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be out the first week of June in...

57:31.534 --> 57:33.015
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew about that a long time ago.

57:33.035 --> 57:34.897
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got delayed like a couple days ago.

57:35.057 --> 57:35.537
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't.

57:35.597 --> 57:37.038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been that date for a long time.

57:37.058 --> 57:38.119
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's when I heard about it.

57:38.139 --> 57:39.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people just didn't know about it.

57:40.240 --> 57:42.322
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also a bunch of good stuff, though, coming out this month.

57:42.342 --> 57:44.944
[SPEAKER_01]: If Europe gets that, too, I'm going to cry because I love Civilization.

57:44.984 --> 57:53.350
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually probably going to get this game because it seems like it really simplified what was becoming a very... Oh, God, I sound so dumb and babyish when I say this.

57:53.370 --> 57:55.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to get it for the 360 or DS?

57:55.932 --> 57:55.912
360.

57:56.612 --> 57:57.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Achievements.

57:57.873 --> 57:58.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

57:58.593 --> 57:59.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Achievements.

57:59.775 --> 58:00.896
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I said.

58:01.256 --> 58:01.476
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

58:01.536 --> 58:02.277
[SPEAKER_01]: And Xbox Live.

58:02.317 --> 58:03.798
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming there's something for Xbox Live.

58:05.158 --> 58:05.959
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember CivNet?

58:05.979 --> 58:06.699
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was the shit.

58:06.739 --> 58:07.520
[SPEAKER_01]: I love CivNet.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.562
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could find a copy of CivNet that still worked, I'd actually probably play it.

58:11.122 --> 58:11.603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

58:13.644 --> 58:13.824
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

58:14.124 --> 58:14.524
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

58:15.125 --> 58:19.548
[SPEAKER_01]: Akuma, JP, and Chat, by the way, just linked the official website for that game.

58:20.208 --> 58:24.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he actually lives in Japan, so he knows a little bit about some of the releases going on over there.

58:24.451 --> 58:25.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he going to get the gardening game?

58:26.432 --> 58:26.772
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing.

58:27.092 --> 58:28.313
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is he going to get the gardening game?

58:28.513 --> 58:29.094
[SPEAKER_01]: I somehow doubt it.

58:30.578 --> 58:36.860
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you really want the gardening game, you can just do a Japanese account and buy them.

58:38.741 --> 58:39.201
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to news.

58:40.642 --> 58:44.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if gardening's not your thing, then perhaps Red vs. Blue is your thing.

58:45.484 --> 58:50.425
[SPEAKER_02]: And Red vs. Blue just released their brand new series, Reconstruction.

58:51.046 --> 58:56.008
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's a little bit more serious and less funny than the original.

58:56.548 --> 58:58.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's not even really that funny at all, but...

59:00.129 --> 59:00.769
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

59:28.462 --> 59:57.616
[SPEAKER_01]: which of course is set in Halo 3 very nice well one of these days there ought to be a Halo movie I know that's been all going back and forth and video game movies seem to be all the rage right now and now throwing their hat into the ring Brett Ratner he's a pretty famous Hollywood director he did the Rush Hour trilogy he did the third part in the X-Men series so take that however you want so do we stab him with our plastic knives yet?

59:58.147 --> 59:59.868
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember watching the first episode and saying, this is lame.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.120
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.861
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched the first episode too and went, this is lame.

01:00:19.302 --> 01:00:26.186
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, here's the thing is that apparently he is saying that he's going to be getting into gaming.

01:00:26.787 --> 01:00:30.089
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he'll, quote, be doing movies that come from video games.

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:36.133
[SPEAKER_01]: He also is mentioning that he has ties to the Activision catalogs.

01:00:36.453 --> 01:00:38.374
[SPEAKER_01]: So possibly Call of Duty.

01:00:38.655 --> 01:00:39.175
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be lame.

01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:40.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Soldier of Fortune.

01:00:40.756 --> 01:00:41.156
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

01:00:41.737 --> 01:00:42.257
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see it.

01:00:42.277 --> 01:00:43.218
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero, the movie.

01:00:43.498 --> 01:00:46.180
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see them doing something original, but Call of Duty, I mean.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.001
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:11.341 --> 01:01:14.807
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard a rumor that he's probably that he may be doing the God of War movie.

01:01:15.127 --> 01:01:16.990
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard a rumor that he sucks.

01:01:18.672 --> 01:01:18.973
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor?

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.296
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that may be fact.

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:26.453
[SPEAKER_01]: Geekboy2424 says, like the Zelda movie, please make it happen.

01:01:26.473 --> 01:01:27.013
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, please, please.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:28.433
[SPEAKER_01]: In true fanboy fashion.

01:01:29.214 --> 01:01:30.994
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that IGN thing good enough?

01:01:31.635 --> 01:01:33.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that was all that there needs to be.

01:01:33.615 --> 01:01:36.496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the IGN thing is all you're ever going to get, probably.

01:01:37.297 --> 01:01:38.837
[SPEAKER_01]: When has Nintendo ever... Oh, wait.

01:01:39.498 --> 01:01:45.040
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that back before it comes up because I remember I was going to say, when has Nintendo ever let any of their properties become movies?

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.641
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because for quite a while I had the Super Mario Bros.

01:01:48.701 --> 01:01:50.582
[SPEAKER_01]: movie erased from my memory.

01:01:51.246 --> 01:01:52.326
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking that actually.

01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:53.987
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just brought it back for all the rest of you.

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:55.548
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Dennis Hopper as Bowser?

01:01:55.868 --> 01:01:57.108
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't actually see that movie.

01:01:57.328 --> 01:01:57.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

01:01:57.889 --> 01:01:58.669
[SPEAKER_01]: John Leguizamo?

01:01:58.689 --> 01:01:59.909
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have not seen that movie.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:01.930
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we need to have a movie night.

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.531
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:04.631 --> 01:02:13.134
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of movies, before we get into the next story, Loki, you didn't talk about it during your gaming week, but you got to take a sneak peek at a recent movie, right?

01:02:13.575 --> 01:02:15.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was screen number 14 for...

01:02:17.594 --> 01:02:18.535
[SPEAKER_02]: for Postal.

01:02:19.075 --> 01:02:20.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I've been watching that.

01:02:20.796 --> 01:02:27.320
[SPEAKER_02]: We got legitimate screener copies at our place of employment and got to check it out.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually watchable, I guess.

01:02:31.603 --> 01:02:33.344
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to be controversial.

01:02:33.564 --> 01:02:38.347
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm just desensitized to a lot of this stuff or if it just really falls flat, but...

01:02:39.919 --> 01:02:42.380
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some funny parts.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:55.243
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part that I laughed at where he's at a job interview and they're asking him all these really stupid questions and then the very final question they ask him is this woman and she's like, what is the difference between a duck?

01:02:58.964 --> 01:02:59.764
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes no sense.

01:03:00.484 --> 01:03:06.446
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just blows up at her and his day kind of gets worse from there.

01:03:06.846 --> 01:03:06.966
[SPEAKER_02]: But

01:03:08.482 --> 01:03:10.402
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's funny parts, I guess, in it.

01:03:10.462 --> 01:03:18.444
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a part where Uwe Boll gets his nuts blown off, and he falls down dead saying, I hate video games.

01:03:18.964 --> 01:03:19.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:23.665
[SPEAKER_02]: But any time that he was on screen, he wasn't even funny.

01:03:23.725 --> 01:03:27.686
[SPEAKER_02]: He was trying to be funny, you know, where, oh, I finance my movies with Nazi gold, huh?

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:29.026
[SPEAKER_02]: I like children, huh?

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.007
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it just wasn't very funny.

01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:32.627
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

01:03:33.993 --> 01:03:39.677
[SPEAKER_02]: Other parts, like, there's a part where they use a cat as a silencer, and that was kind of funny, because it's just ridiculous.

01:03:40.277 --> 01:03:46.361
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's a lot of ridiculous stuff in it, and a lot of stuff, like, there's a... Well, Postal's a pretty ridiculous game, too.

01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:55.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, there's a gunfight where all, you know, it seems like the only people getting killed brutally is, like, children, you know, so I guess that... That's kind of sick.

01:03:55.867 --> 01:03:59.109
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a part in the beginning, you know, where they're arguing about, you know, the...

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:03.875
[SPEAKER_02]: How many virgins are going to get when they blow up a plane and stuff?

01:04:03.895 --> 01:04:05.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, 9-11, ha, funny.

01:04:06.398 --> 01:04:07.239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.907
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, like some other movies I've seen that have tried to be controversial, it doesn't really work.

01:04:14.207 --> 01:04:17.511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sort of is, I guess, but it's not like, oh my god.

01:04:18.072 --> 01:04:18.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

01:04:31.755 --> 01:04:34.676
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.841
[SPEAKER_01]: But not quite as funny

01:05:06.952 --> 01:05:09.234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth like a dollar rental or something like that.

01:05:09.334 --> 01:05:12.917
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would maybe check it out just to say you've seen it.

01:05:13.197 --> 01:05:16.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect it to be very controversial or anything like that.

01:05:16.259 --> 01:05:21.503
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's parts that they just get ridiculous with, like, you know, full frontal Dave Foley and stuff like that.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:25.486
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just... I don't know.

01:05:25.646 --> 01:05:30.590
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of works, but at the same time, it's just really ridiculous and very low budget, I guess.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:31.690
[SPEAKER_01]: With...

01:05:33.406 --> 01:05:37.167
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Janai in chat says Postal equals the Razzie movie of the year.

01:05:37.247 --> 01:05:39.167
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the Razzies will even remember this movie?

01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:41.228
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it deserves a Razzie.

01:05:41.928 --> 01:05:48.550
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as it is, it's 13 screens that it's on.

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:52.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's a lot better than the 4 that was originally thought it was supposed to be on.

01:05:53.391 --> 01:05:53.751
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:05:54.111 --> 01:05:57.512
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to see it just so I can understand for myself how...

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:01.274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming out for a while on DVD.

01:06:01.675 --> 01:06:05.401
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that far away, but not for a few months.

01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:07.744
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'd like to view.

01:06:09.327 --> 01:06:11.390
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's keep moving with the news.

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.554
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our listeners want to break so they can go to the bathroom.

01:06:15.053 --> 01:06:16.854
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people do want that, don't they?

01:06:18.254 --> 01:06:25.136
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, another series that has a pretty good following is the Brothers in Arms series.

01:06:26.736 --> 01:06:39.019
[SPEAKER_06]: There is actually a book that was put out, a novelization, that covers two of the days that weren't covered in the ten days of the operation that the game covers.

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:41.740
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, the game itself was for when...

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.761
[SPEAKER_06]: The Allies were trying to seize a bridge in the Netherlands in 1944.

01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:57.423
[SPEAKER_06]: But now there's also talks about there being a movie based off of the Hell's Highway thing.

01:06:57.443 --> 01:06:58.603
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be pretty cool.

01:06:58.643 --> 01:06:59.503
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that could work.

01:06:59.844 --> 01:07:06.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers in Arms actually has characters and a story that it follows instead of just war, war, war, war, shoot, shoot, kill, kill, Nazi dead.

01:07:07.435 --> 01:07:07.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:07:07.835 --> 01:07:10.737
[SPEAKER_06]: They have material to work with.

01:07:10.797 --> 01:07:12.098
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a good source.

01:07:13.338 --> 01:07:24.484
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the biggest things that bugs me about... Yeah, but Saving Private Ryan, it's not... One of the things that bugs me about movies made from video games is where they take...

01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:26.641
[SPEAKER_06]: SILENT HILL

01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:53.222
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thrown her off the cliff myself.

01:07:53.242 --> 01:07:54.662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she just said it twice.

01:07:55.002 --> 01:07:55.983
[SPEAKER_01]: But low, and that was a lot.

01:07:56.003 --> 01:07:57.884
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it she had her dream?

01:07:57.944 --> 01:08:02.386
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to point out, Silent Hill did have Pyramid Head ripping somebody's skin off, so it did deliver.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:04.467
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the fan service.

01:08:04.827 --> 01:08:05.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:08:06.247 --> 01:08:08.668
[SPEAKER_06]: He made the shouty bitch shut up.

01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:11.890
[SPEAKER_06]: And the very end of it, too, when they killed the Borg Queen.

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:13.430
[SPEAKER_01]: They need Silent Hill 2.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.751
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyramid Head rapes everyone.

01:08:15.214 --> 01:08:15.615
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

01:08:16.998 --> 01:08:17.239
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:08:17.499 --> 01:08:18.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I need dream movies.

01:08:19.123 --> 01:08:20.065
Oh my god.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:21.207
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:08:21.307 --> 01:08:23.692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Pyramid Head gets set loose on the streets of San Diego.

01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:25.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill 6 The Roommate

01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:58.224
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually have where it could be like a comedy, like a sitcom, you know, where some guy ends up getting this roommate because he needs an apartment and can't find any other places to rent.

01:08:58.684 --> 01:09:01.025
[SPEAKER_02]: And that roommate happens to be Pyramid Head.

01:09:01.105 --> 01:09:02.525
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, hilarity ensues.

01:09:02.885 --> 01:09:06.186
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like it would be a cheesy YouTube series.

01:09:06.206 --> 01:09:06.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head.

01:09:06.826 --> 01:09:09.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, you're leaving skins of corpses around.

01:09:09.227 --> 01:09:09.587
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

01:09:09.727 --> 01:09:10.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Take WD-40 to that rusty head

01:09:35.458 --> 01:09:36.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

01:09:36.398 --> 01:09:37.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but no.

01:09:37.719 --> 01:09:39.639
[SPEAKER_02]: Paint a face on it like Jack.

01:09:39.739 --> 01:09:43.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you realize I'm going to go home and draw this now, right?

01:09:44.401 --> 01:09:44.801
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dear.

01:09:45.061 --> 01:09:47.502
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, but no, but do you get my point?

01:09:48.762 --> 01:09:48.942
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

01:09:49.223 --> 01:10:00.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that if they're taking something that there are already an established fan base for, I understand wanting to get more people than just the fan base to see it, but they need to stay true to their core material.

01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:02.107
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm actually kind of...

01:10:03.402 --> 01:10:09.768
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling actually kind of good about them doing a movie for this series because you've got something established and easy to work with, I think.

01:10:10.469 --> 01:10:14.552
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that there's not really too much room to fuck it up unless you let, you know, Uwe Boll do it.

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:16.034
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see what happens.

01:10:17.369 --> 01:10:26.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't really know how to translate, or I should say, kind of move over to this story, but hey, let's talk about something completely different, I guess.

01:10:27.373 --> 01:10:28.273
[SPEAKER_02]: How about something local?

01:10:28.634 --> 01:10:29.554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something local.

01:10:29.754 --> 01:10:30.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Local news.

01:10:30.194 --> 01:10:30.594
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:10:31.115 --> 01:10:34.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently someone is acknowledging Stockton, California.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:35.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:36.137
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:10:36.617 --> 01:10:42.859
[SPEAKER_02]: Because apparently they wrote an article about, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 and how it's making people crazy.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.840
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, according to the Stockton record...

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.761
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a couple quotes here.

01:10:49.121 --> 01:11:02.146
[SPEAKER_02]: My son Peter was never really aggressive, but once he got into the video games, GTA being one of them, he started to push, hit, talk back, and just become a different person, said Stockton parent Greg Within.

01:11:02.847 --> 01:11:03.847
[SPEAKER_02]: His last name is Within.

01:11:03.987 --> 01:11:04.507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.

01:11:06.188 --> 01:11:09.310
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't really say how old his son is.

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:12.511
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people that are letting their 8-year-old son play these games, so...

01:11:13.876 --> 01:11:39.221
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty 4 I don't get it and then anyways there's another one this other guy who's 19 said he was involved in an altercation a week after he purchased Grand Theft Auto 4 he says at the time he noticed that he had become less sensitive to violence Grand Theft Auto 4 tearing a neighborhood apart and the 19 year old says it didn't completely blame the game for his violence but it did affect him

01:11:40.413 --> 01:11:40.813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:11:40.833 --> 01:11:41.654
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds retarded.

01:11:42.054 --> 01:11:53.060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's covered on GamePolitics and you can also find it at RecordNet.com which is the official Stockton newspaper's website.

01:11:53.921 --> 01:11:57.703
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Stockton is like the butthole of the Sacramento area.

01:11:58.343 --> 01:11:59.744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even Sacramento area.

01:11:59.824 --> 01:12:05.487
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like... That space between Sacramento and LA that you drive down on the freeway.

01:12:06.628 --> 01:12:09.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Or worse yet, that space between Sacramento and Fresno.

01:12:12.324 --> 01:12:16.505
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can blame Jesse... They do have a good arcade there, though.

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:20.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Corona, as... The author of the original article.

01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:24.448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as Grand Theft Auto 4, criticized by Stockonians.

01:12:24.988 --> 01:12:25.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Stockonians!

01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.209
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow!

01:12:27.369 --> 01:12:28.370
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what they call themselves?

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:29.670
[SPEAKER_01]: That's retarded.

01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:32.811
[SPEAKER_01]: We should go to Stockton, why?

01:12:49.485 --> 01:12:50.646
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't they have an S-Mart?

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:51.907
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if we get to know.

01:12:52.027 --> 01:12:53.008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they do have an S-Mart.

01:12:53.628 --> 01:12:55.469
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to comment on it every time we go by there.

01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:56.470
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know something else?

01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:58.352
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually spell it out, Save Mart, now.

01:12:58.532 --> 01:12:58.992
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shoot.

01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:08.779
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know something that's pretty funny, though, too, is this story right here is basically written about the launch day of Grand Theft Auto 4, yet it's coming out a month afterwards.

01:13:08.979 --> 01:13:10.901
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, talk about trying to fill space.

01:13:12.162 --> 01:13:12.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:13:13.719 --> 01:13:20.423
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, SSJ100 in chat says, I heard a mother say she got the game for her kid because he was being made fun of in school for not having the game.

01:13:20.804 --> 01:13:21.804
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, the kid was 12.

01:13:23.425 --> 01:13:24.366
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid.

01:13:25.466 --> 01:13:27.548
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids don't get made fun of for anything.

01:13:27.728 --> 01:13:32.951
[SPEAKER_02]: The color of their hair, their name, the clothes they wear, the way they walk, talk, behave.

01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:35.873
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get over it.

01:13:36.013 --> 01:13:37.054
[SPEAKER_01]: That's school for you.

01:13:37.494 --> 01:13:38.114
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

01:13:38.174 --> 01:13:40.536
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some more Grand Theft Auto 4 related news.

01:13:46.482 --> 01:13:50.911
[SPEAKER_01]: Benny Hill's coming to, uh, no, it's, uh, actually has to do with, uh, kind of an idiot.

01:13:51.733 --> 01:13:54.178
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with a 13-year-old boy...

01:13:56.230 --> 01:14:01.735
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't give out his name because he's only 13, but if we could, he would win this week's Stupid Award.

01:14:02.496 --> 01:14:06.339
[SPEAKER_01]: This is coming from the police, Paul Shastani.

01:14:06.599 --> 01:14:10.162
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a lieutenant of a Massachusetts police force.

01:14:10.523 --> 01:14:21.352
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a male 13-year-old, and what he did, he stayed after class when other students had left the classroom, and then pulled an 11-inch knife on the teacher and asked for 20 bucks.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:25.792
[SPEAKER_01]: When the teacher refused, he lowered his demand to $1.

01:14:25.832 --> 01:14:26.393
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a dollar!

01:14:31.158 --> 01:14:33.320
[SPEAKER_01]: The teacher then took the knife from the student.

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:36.503
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't explain how that happened, but the teacher was able to get the knife away from the student.

01:14:36.563 --> 01:14:37.544
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like punched him.

01:14:37.784 --> 01:14:38.865
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, no, here's the thing.

01:14:39.205 --> 01:14:49.674
[SPEAKER_01]: The police said the boy wanted to buy the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but his mother had refused to give him the money, so he came up with an alternate plan.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:54.919
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, why was the kid trying to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, dude?

01:14:54.939 --> 01:14:56.180
[SPEAKER_01]: That game's been out for like years.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.241
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he only has a PlayStation 2.

01:14:59.432 --> 01:15:02.713
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently his mom's a bitch for not buying him any violent video games.

01:15:02.733 --> 01:15:07.074
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that makes sense, because I think it's cheaper now, so only $20 might cover that game.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:12.895
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it would, and it'd be slightly short with tax, so it sucks for him.

01:15:13.335 --> 01:15:19.417
[SPEAKER_01]: But the moral of the story is, this guy sucks, and his parents kind of suck for letting him get away with this.

01:15:20.597 --> 01:15:21.157
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:29.272
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, whenever we hear these types of stories and get out stupid words, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

01:15:29.852 --> 01:15:31.553
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get angsty, people die.

01:15:31.993 --> 01:15:33.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and the FUs of the week happen.

01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:40.879
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is bad.

01:15:41.099 --> 01:15:42.680
Here is justice.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.320
Here is punishment.

01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:46.182
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, San Andreas?

01:15:46.202 --> 01:15:47.582
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucked up.

01:15:49.103 --> 01:15:51.925
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't really think I'm angsty about anything right now.

01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:54.573
[SPEAKER_01]: Make something up.

01:15:56.154 --> 01:15:58.637
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to my digestive system.

01:15:59.377 --> 01:15:59.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:03.161
[SPEAKER_06]: For killing me softly with Ipsong.

01:16:04.883 --> 01:16:05.944
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Roberta Flack.

01:16:06.704 --> 01:16:07.305
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki.

01:16:07.905 --> 01:16:09.687
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, F you to Monster Mini Golf.

01:16:09.847 --> 01:16:12.930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this chain of mini, indoor mini golf places.

01:16:13.311 --> 01:16:16.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they opened one up here in Rancho Cordova.

01:16:16.353 --> 01:16:17.755
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna go there, does it suck?

01:16:18.297 --> 01:16:18.897
[SPEAKER_02]: It does suck.

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:23.899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the Nimbus Winery.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my problem with it.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.202
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, they just put no thought into the course design whatsoever.

01:16:29.322 --> 01:16:31.703
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of goes around there in a giant maze.

01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:37.805
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no barriers from one hole to the next, so you don't know where one course begins and another one ends.

01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:43.248
[SPEAKER_02]: And you practically have to search the course to find the hole that you're supposed to be knocking the ball into.

01:16:44.187 --> 01:16:50.110
[SPEAKER_02]: So they spent little time on the course, but they have all these cool props that are like all pneumatic and stuff like that that are really cool.

01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:55.192
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I mean, indoor mini golf in this area would be a fucking awesome idea.

01:16:55.352 --> 01:16:57.433
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, why isn't anyone doing it right?

01:16:57.513 --> 01:17:06.757
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I had the money to set up something like that, I would at least put a few seconds thought into the actual course instead of just throwing some shit together.

01:17:07.678 --> 01:17:08.478
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be going back.

01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:14.972
[SPEAKER_01]: I give an F you to driving home at 2.30 in the morning and falling asleep at the wheel.

01:17:15.412 --> 01:17:17.353
[SPEAKER_01]: But thankfully, somebody else was there to take over.

01:17:17.393 --> 01:17:22.015
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't drive unsafe, but just F you to the fact that I thought I'd be able to stay up at night.

01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:22.576
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't.

01:17:22.956 --> 01:17:23.636
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do it.

01:17:24.577 --> 01:17:25.537
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to me being weak.

01:17:26.704 --> 01:17:49.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one thing that we will not be giving an F you to because it's awesome is classic video games that we love and adore and we're about ready to wrap up part A but we can't do it until we pay some respect to our elders and we do that by asking the one and only DarkSakura to dig through the archives of games every week and pick out one of her favorites to be featured as the OLR Classic Game of the Week.

01:17:49.656 --> 01:17:51.737
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what should the kids be checking out this week?

01:17:52.859 --> 01:18:02.281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little game called Ghouls and Ghosts, also called Dai Makai Mura, which is really, really, you know, it's Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:03.602
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you go wrong with that?

01:18:03.662 --> 01:18:04.422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's classic.

01:18:05.102 --> 01:18:06.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence, classic game of the week.

01:18:07.223 --> 01:18:08.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

01:18:08.823 --> 01:18:10.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the music is the best.

01:18:13.164 --> 01:18:13.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:18:23.604 --> 01:18:41.291
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyway, you play as a knight called Arthur who has to go through a bunch of really friggin' tough stages to go rescue his woman and save a soul by Lucifer.

01:18:42.392 --> 01:18:46.833
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's funny that his bride is named Princess Prin Prin.

01:18:47.154 --> 01:18:47.974
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really hilarious.

01:18:48.454 --> 01:18:50.936
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you pick up different weapons on the way.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:55.058
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, this is a sequel to Makai Mura, which was Ghosts and Goblins over here.

01:18:55.859 --> 01:19:02.523
[SPEAKER_06]: And the change between this one to the last one is that you can fire up and jump and fire.

01:19:05.025 --> 01:19:06.306
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also get different weapons.

01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:07.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Never use the sword.

01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:08.567
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

01:19:10.151 --> 01:19:11.171
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get the lances.

01:19:11.471 --> 01:19:12.072
[SPEAKER_06]: The holy water.

01:19:12.452 --> 01:19:12.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:19:13.372 --> 01:19:22.475
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, you've also got different enemies that show up, like, you know, a bunch of demon-y things, and a magician that every so often will either turn him into an old man or a duck.

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:24.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:19:24.376 --> 01:19:31.578
[SPEAKER_06]: You also get, you know, your gold armor, so you get your charge attack and one extra, I guess, hit that you can take.

01:19:32.058 --> 01:19:36.060
[SPEAKER_06]: The really hard part about this game is that you do have a limited number of hits you can take.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:36.980
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

01:19:54.639 --> 01:19:59.285
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally just collapse into skulls and bones, which is kind of funny.

01:19:59.385 --> 01:20:10.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Amiga, Armstrong, CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Saturn, which I have that copy and I actually bought it at a Babbage's.

01:20:11.886 --> 01:20:20.232
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bought it at an American retailer, I think it's hilarious, because it was only on the Capcom Generations that they brought out in Japan.

01:20:20.852 --> 01:20:28.678
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on PlayStation Super Graphics, Master System, Genesis, Virtual Console release, and the ZX Spectrum.

01:20:29.638 --> 01:20:35.222
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really freaking fun, and also this game, and I'm going to spoil it for everyone.

01:20:35.603 --> 01:20:37.944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only been out, you know, 20 years.

01:20:38.064 --> 01:20:40.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's been out 20 years, it was released in 19...

01:20:40.666 --> 01:20:42.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, as of December, it will be out 20 years.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:43.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:20:44.568 --> 01:20:45.809
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released in December 1988.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:50.551
[SPEAKER_06]: But... I had a point.

01:20:52.713 --> 01:20:53.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:20:54.033 --> 01:20:57.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to spoil the ending, when you get to the end of the game, you have to do it again.

01:20:57.115 --> 01:20:58.956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, guess what?

01:20:59.096 --> 01:21:01.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember all that sweating that you did to get through this game?

01:21:02.638 --> 01:21:03.098
[SPEAKER_06]: We lied.

01:21:03.178 --> 01:21:03.698
[SPEAKER_06]: No ending.

01:21:03.738 --> 01:21:04.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it again.

01:21:05.039 --> 01:21:08.521
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you have to go through the whole thing all over again.

01:21:09.742 --> 01:21:10.682
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadistic.

01:21:11.162 --> 01:21:13.984
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, really evil.

01:21:14.644 --> 01:21:21.567
[SPEAKER_06]: It also did have a sequel to it, which in my opinion was disappointing with Super Ghouls N' Ghosts.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:28.090
[SPEAKER_06]: It did have a very epic opening, and it was really freaking hard, but I don't think that it was as much fun as this one.

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:35.734
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the one that drove me crazy at E3 two years ago, hunting down, and then they kicked me off of playing it, was Ultimate Ghosts N' Goblins.

01:21:36.674 --> 01:21:37.774
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a PSP release.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:41.535
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was actually really fun and just as frickin' hard as all the other of them.

01:21:42.176 --> 01:21:44.796
[SPEAKER_06]: So... That's your game.

01:21:45.196 --> 01:21:46.017
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the game.

01:21:46.417 --> 01:21:49.338
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can beat this game, you have a very big EP-ing.

01:21:50.058 --> 01:21:50.658
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can beat this game.

01:21:50.678 --> 01:21:51.158
[SPEAKER_01]: I've beaten the game.

01:21:51.518 --> 01:21:52.799
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your EP-ing is very big.

01:21:52.859 --> 01:21:55.359
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen my husband beat it on one credit.

01:21:55.899 --> 01:21:56.800
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.

01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:00.581
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen him beat a number of games on one... I've seen him beat R-Type on one credit.

01:22:00.681 --> 01:22:01.061
[SPEAKER_01]: Yikes.

01:22:01.932 --> 01:22:03.733
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, folks.

01:22:03.893 --> 01:22:07.455
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghouls and Ghosts on like a million different systems.

01:22:07.735 --> 01:22:08.496
[SPEAKER_01]: So, check it out.

01:22:09.116 --> 01:22:12.578
[SPEAKER_01]: The system you would urge, though, I'm sure has got to be the Sega one, right?

01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:16.780
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Saturn has the Arcade Perfect version.

01:22:17.241 --> 01:22:22.664
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you're going to get it for any of the home systems, and it says Virtual Console as well, get the Genesis version.

01:22:23.464 --> 01:22:24.845
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, for any of the...

01:22:25.489 --> 01:22:28.191
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mind the Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:34.234
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're not a fan, but... And honestly, and this is my problem because I was always a Super Nintendo fangirl.

01:22:34.254 --> 01:22:38.116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually do like Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:22:38.156 --> 01:22:39.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong at all.

01:22:39.097 --> 01:22:40.038
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the game.

01:22:40.178 --> 01:22:42.359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it was a bit of a letdown.

01:22:42.839 --> 01:22:43.259
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as good.

01:22:43.279 --> 01:22:49.183
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's comparing vanilla ice cream to chocolate peanut butter ice cream.

01:22:49.203 --> 01:22:50.384
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's like taking like...

01:22:51.611 --> 01:22:53.512
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold Stone vs. Soft Serve at McDonald's

01:23:21.778 --> 01:23:22.798
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say it's that bad.

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:25.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Soft-serving McDonald's tastes like whipped cream.

01:23:26.019 --> 01:23:26.459
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.160
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go with the food again.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we've got to take a break.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.741
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost an hour and a half into the show.

01:23:30.761 --> 01:23:32.121
[SPEAKER_01]: I have ice cream at home, Rob.

01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:32.341
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

01:23:32.361 --> 01:23:35.202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Medieval Madness, and I bought it because it's the same as a pinball machine.

01:23:35.362 --> 01:23:37.163
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't eat ice cream right now.

01:23:37.283 --> 01:23:37.983
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't eat low-fat ice cream.

01:23:38.003 --> 01:23:43.024
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I can have, I have had a pretty awesome, there's a self-serve non-fat yogurt place over by William's house.

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:47.166
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome because you get to make the yogurt yourself, and then they have toppings galore that you put on there.

01:23:47.186 --> 01:23:48.306
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a TCBY by my house.

01:23:49.175 --> 01:23:49.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

01:23:49.835 --> 01:23:51.176
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, look, we're going to take a break.

01:23:52.317 --> 01:23:54.058
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned for more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:54.078 --> 01:23:57.861
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even touch Nintendo Wii News and we got a whole lot of it coming up in the next segment.

01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:02.384
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of Xbox 360 news as well, even though it was a little slow in the house of Microsoft this week.

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:05.686
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be talking a little bit about those systems right after a quick break.

01:24:05.766 --> 01:24:06.346
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you then.

01:24:06.986 --> 01:24:11.950
