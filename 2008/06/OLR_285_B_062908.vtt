00:14.860 --> 00:19.260
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.260 --> 00:26.660
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June 29th, 2008, for part B of our podcast.

00:26.660 --> 00:32.920
Remember, Orange Lounge Radio tapes on Sunday nights live on All Games Radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

00:32.920 --> 00:36.520
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at www.allgames.com

00:36.520 --> 00:41.120
and then it releases in a podcast form twice a week for your entertainment.

00:41.120 --> 00:47.620
And tonight for your entertainment, Tommy Tallarico is going to be here on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live very shortly.

00:47.620 --> 00:53.760
But first, we're going to talk about some gaming news and I thought since we are going to be talking about music and video games,

00:53.760 --> 00:58.400
how about some music news? Do you have some music game news for us, Loki, you could share?

00:58.400 --> 00:59.500
Yes, I do actually.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.000
Awesome.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.500
There's some pretty interesting stuff we've been kind of hoping for this to actually happen.

01:04.500 --> 01:16.000
But, apparently, a box shot of Samba de Amigo, a bundle with Meraka controller add-ons,

01:16.000 --> 01:16.500
Yes.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.900
has been seen at a UK retailer HMV's website.

01:20.900 --> 01:27.200
Now, I hope they aren't the cheapy-crappy little plastic snap-on things like you've seen for Wii Golf and Wii Tennis, right?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.500
Like, they need to make the shaky Meraka noise.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.900
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch when you use them.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.400
It looks like that they have Meraka's on top of it.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.300
I don't know if they make the shaky noise, but I don't see why they wouldn't.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.700
If you're going to do Meraka controllers, do them right or don't do them at all, right?

01:39.700 --> 01:47.500
And it's right now on there for 34.99 euros, which is about $70 US.

01:47.500 --> 01:54.100
And we always like to read comments from Chat, the ever-present fourth guest on our show, at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, live on Sunday.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.900
And J-Rod says simply, Meraka's equals win.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.100
Meraka's do equal win.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.100
What other games could be made better by Meraka's?

02:03.100 --> 02:04.900
Dark Sakura, you think of anything?

02:04.900 --> 02:07.500
Games that could be made better with Meraka's?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.000
Yes.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.900
Um, um...

02:11.900 --> 02:13.700
Soul Calibur? I don't know.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.200
Yes, Meraka Calibur!

02:15.200 --> 02:17.600
Because, remember, I did Rod Calibur.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600
Yeah, you can do Rod Calibur on the Dreamcast.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.000
Simple to do Meraka Calibur.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.500
There you go.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.300
I've got Meraka's controllers.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.300
Me too, on Dreamcast, believe it or not.

02:24.300 --> 02:24.800
For Dreamcast.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.100
Let's try Meraka's Calibur.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.900
Actually, any game can be played with the Meraka's.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.100
Awesome.

02:31.100 --> 02:31.600
If you think about it.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.800
3rd Bullet suggests Gears of Meraka's.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.500
Gears of Meraka's?

02:35.500 --> 02:38.600
Miso suggests Cooking Mama is better with Meraka's.

02:38.600 --> 02:43.800
The only thing that's kind of weird about the Meraka controller, though, I noticed,

02:43.800 --> 02:47.600
is that, um, where's the infrared gonna come out?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.600
Unless it goes all the way through the middle there.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.300
Because it looks like the top's covered by the Meraka's.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.100
Who knows? Who knows?

02:55.100 --> 03:00.800
Well, one game that will not be made better by Meraka's is a game near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Launch Radio.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.700
It's Beat Mania 2DX.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.100
You know, this series has been around forever.

03:05.100 --> 03:05.900
A long, long time.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.000
Like, I remember when we first started this show.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.400
Probably, like, Sick Style was the hot new thing that was out on the block, I think, when this show started.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.100
I, I think so.

03:14.100 --> 03:19.300
Believe it or not, this week was announced Beat Mania 2DX 16.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.900
And, you know, ever since, uh, I wanna say Happy Sky or Red.

03:22.900 --> 03:23.800
No, Red was the first one.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.500
Ever since, uh, 11th Style or Red, if you will.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.400
Uh, they've been given sub names.

03:28.400 --> 03:38.200
And, uh, let's see, we had, what, 11 was Red, 12 was Happy Sky, 13 was, uh, Distorted, 14 was Gold, 15 was DJ Troopers.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.400
Well, announced this week, Beat Mania 2DX 16 Empress.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.500
That is incredibly gay looking.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.200
Yes, it is.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.000
Hey, wait a minute.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.800
No, it, it really is.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.600
Uh, it's a pink Sailor Moon looking logo, uh, 2DX 16 Empress.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.200
There's a little butterfly hanging off the S, and it's pink.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.200
It is very, very, very pink.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.700
So, you go from the manliness of DJ Troopers to the not-so-manliness of Empress.

04:03.700 --> 04:04.600
But, you know what?

04:04.600 --> 04:06.900
I think the game might still be a lot of fun.

04:06.900 --> 04:12.100
And, uh, there's already, uh, apparently some song names coming out from the test locations.

04:12.100 --> 04:19.300
Apparently one song in Beat Mania 2DX 16 Empress, which, yes, is as pink as the, uh, little banner would have you thinking.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.500
This is all over the internet.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.000
Um, V2 is supposed to be in this game.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.200
A sequel to V by Taka.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.800
One of the most hoarded songs in Beat Mania 2DX history.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.800
If you've ever walked by a Beat Mania or a DDR machine, you've probably read this one.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.200
It actually is a V final from, um, that Taka album that came out.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.700
Ahhh.

04:37.700 --> 04:38.800
There you go.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.600
So, Beat Mania 2DX Empress location testing right now, which means it'll probably be out in Japan in a couple of months.

04:43.600 --> 04:51.200
And you'll probably see the home version in Japan only, sadly, early next year because, uh, they tried to release Beat Mania here.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.800
And, unfortunately, it didn't do too well because people thought it was a Guitar Hero ripoff.

04:55.800 --> 05:01.700
Shame on Konami for sitting on what could have been a gold mine for far, far, far too long.

05:01.700 --> 05:15.000
Well, another potential, uh, gold mine, and this is one that was, uh, sent to us by the lovely and talented Sauce, is, uh, A Rumor of Guitar Hero Beatles Edition.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.700
Which, actually, I think would be pretty cool.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.300
Um...

05:18.300 --> 05:20.800
That would be kinda neat.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.000
I think that more of the young whippersnappers need to hear some Beatles music.

05:25.000 --> 05:38.300
Well, um, the, uh, Sony, um, ATV CEO, uh, Marty Bond, is it Bondier or Bondier, I guess, um, said that what they, they've actually talked about putting Beatles songs in a Guitar Hero game.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.900
And something that you'd like to pursue, and that's a quote.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.200
So...

05:43.200 --> 05:44.600
Maybe...

05:44.600 --> 05:46.000
It could happen?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Wouldn't that be weird if Beatles were in Guitar Hero before they were on iTunes?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Because, you know, that's, like, the big, uh, the big thing.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
They never can be on iTunes, I think.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.300
I know, because of the whole Apple thing, but it's just kind of interesting, you know?

05:56.300 --> 05:59.100
Like, eh, what's taking them so long to get on iTunes?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.900
But, there you go.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.800
And big, differing opinions in the chat room.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.100
ThirdBullet says, I hate the Beatles.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.100
Uh, Misty says, Beatles...

06:07.100 --> 06:08.900
You're getting booted from the chat room.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.200
Misty says, Beatles, fuck yeah.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.000
Watch me do it.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.100
This is not a democracy here at O.L.R.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.700
This is a jameocracy.

06:18.700 --> 06:19.800
Who is it, ThirdBullet?

06:19.800 --> 06:20.700
I...

06:20.700 --> 06:22.500
You don't have to ram.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.500
Alright.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
Jameocracy?

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
Jameocracy?

06:25.500 --> 06:26.500
Jameocracy.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
Yeah.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
Revolution!

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
Off with her head!

06:29.500 --> 06:31.500
I'm just kidding.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.500
Alright.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
Well, um...

06:33.500 --> 06:35.500
I don't know if we're gonna...

06:35.500 --> 06:40.200
Well, we'll probably be getting this before we'll see Beatles on any, uh, sort of system

06:40.200 --> 06:46.600
for it, but, uh, Rockband is getting, um, I guess some tracks from Crewfest, which is

06:46.600 --> 06:50.000
the, uh, Motley Crue tour, I guess.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.100
And, um, they've got a few tracks on here, including a free one.

06:55.100 --> 07:00.800
Um, part of the Crewfest pack, which is gonna be 240 Microsoft points, or $3, you've got

07:00.800 --> 07:03.300
Down at the Whiskey by Motley Crue.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.700
Um, you've got Time is Running Out by Papa Roach.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.660
Uh, Who's Going Home with You Tonight by Trapped.

07:10.660 --> 07:18.180
And also, uh, the free track, Promised Land by, um, looks like Vesuvius, I guess.

07:18.180 --> 07:22.660
And that's supposedly coming from the new movie, The Rocker, which, uh, stars, uh, the

07:22.660 --> 07:25.700
guy from, uh, The Office who plays Dwight.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.300
Yes, I've seen those ads all over MySpace, and frankly, I'm sick of them.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.580
Hey, free track!

07:31.580 --> 07:32.580
It sucks!

07:32.580 --> 07:33.580
Who cares?

07:33.580 --> 07:36.020
Free track is free, so, uh, hey, why not?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.720
It's worth checking out.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.020
Do you think, uh, free track's worth...

07:39.020 --> 07:43.700
I mean, it's not like it's the Yaris theme song, so it can't be all bad, right?

07:43.700 --> 07:44.700
Let's hope.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.700
Alright.

07:45.700 --> 07:50.620
Well, that's gonna do it for some of our video game news, uh, music edition for right now,

07:50.620 --> 07:51.620
but hey, you know what?

07:51.620 --> 07:54.900
Earlier this week, we had the fortune to speak with Tommy Tallarico.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.420
You might remember him from his appearances on G4's Judgment Day, or you probably heard

07:58.420 --> 08:01.100
his music in games like Earthworm Jim, Advent Rising.

08:01.100 --> 08:05.580
Well, now Tommy is best known for his work with the Video Games Live concert series.

08:05.580 --> 08:09.820
Recently, Video Games Live announced an expansive world tour, so we reached out to Tommy to

08:09.820 --> 08:13.940
come on the show to talk about the upcoming tour, as well as respond to some of the recent

08:13.940 --> 08:16.580
emails we've gotten about Video Games Live.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.820
So let's head on over to the Skype line.

08:18.820 --> 08:21.380
Alright, hey, Tommy, are you there?

08:21.380 --> 08:22.660
Yo, I am here!

08:22.660 --> 08:25.900
Hey, Tommy Tallarico, how are you doing this fine evening?

08:25.900 --> 08:28.600
I'm doing great, working as always.

08:28.600 --> 08:33.040
You must be a very, very busy man traveling to all these new places on the Video Games

08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
Live tour.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.540
Do you actually go to all the shows yourself?

08:35.540 --> 08:42.060
Oh, yeah, every single show, aside from, uh, creating and, uh, producing the show every

08:42.060 --> 08:46.580
night we also, um, I also host the show and even play guitar with the symphony towards

08:46.580 --> 08:47.580
the end.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.700
So you've got to be pretty exhausted, because not only are you balancing Video Games Live,

08:51.700 --> 08:54.500
but Video Games Live isn't the only thing you do, either, so...

08:54.500 --> 08:59.540
Yeah, yeah, I mean, aside from my, you know, still working on a few game, smaller game

08:59.540 --> 09:05.180
projects here and there, because VGL definitely takes up most of, uh, 95% of my time, but,

09:05.180 --> 09:12.140
uh, working on a couple DS and Wii and PC products, as well as also the, uh, the Chairman

09:12.140 --> 09:15.540
of the, um, the Game Audio Network Guild.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.540
Excellent.

09:16.540 --> 09:19.460
I definitely want to ask you about the Game Audio Network Guild, but I know the listeners

09:19.460 --> 09:22.540
want to hear about Video Games Live, absolutely, because we've gotten, you know, emails and

09:22.540 --> 09:23.620
calls about it.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.580
Let me ask you this about Video Games Live.

09:25.580 --> 09:31.460
You're going to so many new places on this, you know, 50-date city tour you just announced.

09:31.460 --> 09:35.300
What can someone who has never been to Video Games Live before expect to experience?

09:35.300 --> 09:41.140
Yeah, well, Video Games Live is all the greatest video game music of all time, played by a

09:41.140 --> 09:47.300
full symphony and choir, but what makes it really unique is that everyb- everything is

09:47.300 --> 09:54.340
completely synchronized with, uh, video and rock and roll lighting and special effects

09:54.340 --> 10:00.540
and interactivity with the crowd and stage show production and we have a whole pre-show

10:00.540 --> 10:07.420
festival with gaming competitions and prize giveaways and costume contests and a post-show

10:07.420 --> 10:11.300
meet and greet, which is open for everyone with peo- different people in the industry

10:11.300 --> 10:14.320
and famous composers and designers and things like that.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.460
So it really is a complete celebration of the entire video game industry.

10:19.460 --> 10:24.180
In fact, I kind of like to describe it as all of the power and emotion of a symphony

10:24.180 --> 10:30.620
orchestra combined with the excitement and energy of a rock concert mixed together with

10:30.620 --> 10:37.780
all of the cutting edge visuals, technology, interactivity, and fun that video games provide.

10:37.780 --> 10:41.060
It's kind of like, the way you describe it, it's almost like a traveling convention of

10:41.060 --> 10:42.060
sorts.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.900
There's so much to see at these shows.

10:43.900 --> 10:47.940
Yeah, I mean, we really wanted to create an event, you know?

10:47.940 --> 10:50.300
We didn't want to create, you know, we wanted to create a show.

10:50.300 --> 10:55.900
We didn't want to just create a concert or, you know, oh yeah, here's a bunch of classical

10:55.900 --> 10:59.460
people in tuxedos up on a stage playing video game music.

10:59.460 --> 11:04.180
I mean, you know, and that's great as well, but, you know, people have been doing that,

11:04.180 --> 11:08.980
they've been doing that in Japan for almost 20 years now, so, you know, we wanted to do

11:08.980 --> 11:15.020
something completely new, completely unique, and really, our goal from the beginning was

11:15.020 --> 11:19.540
to create this show for the non-gamer as well.

11:19.540 --> 11:26.160
You know, we wanted to create something that was, had mass appeal, and that you don't have

11:26.160 --> 11:31.040
to know a darn thing at all about video games in order to come to the show and really be

11:31.040 --> 11:38.140
blown away and entertained, and that's why Video Games Live has grown, you know, so quickly

11:38.140 --> 11:40.300
and as big as it has.

11:40.300 --> 11:48.100
We did three shows in 2005, 11 shows in 2006, 29 last year in 2007.

11:48.100 --> 11:53.320
This year we have over 50 shows, next year we have over 80 shows, and the goal is to

11:53.320 --> 11:58.540
build it by 2010 up to 100 and to 120 shows a year.

11:58.540 --> 12:06.100
So yeah, you know, so by having all these visuals, by creating a performance and a production

12:06.100 --> 12:14.660
and an event and a show, it clearly crosses over and has much more mass appeal than just,

12:14.660 --> 12:22.380
you know, a hardcore gaming concert that, you know, that all the Final Fantasy fans

12:22.380 --> 12:26.100
go to or all the, you know, whatever particular items.

12:26.100 --> 12:30.940
We want to appeal to everybody, whether you're into video games or not, and again, that's

12:30.940 --> 12:36.480
not to downplay what all of the amazing concerts in the past have done and continue to do,

12:36.480 --> 12:38.700
but ours is a little different.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.500
Let me go off of that a little bit because you talk about making this concert accessible

12:41.500 --> 12:45.220
to even those that are non-gamers, and I know we have a lot of listeners that are a little

12:45.220 --> 12:49.500
bit younger, 15, 16, 17, it's a little harder for them to just kind of get up and go get

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
a concert ticket.

12:50.500 --> 12:55.260
What would you say would be the best way to sell a night at Video Games Live to my parents?

12:55.260 --> 12:56.740
Yeah, oh, absolutely.

12:56.740 --> 13:02.040
Well, I mean, of course there's a website, videogameslive.com, and we have a bunch of

13:02.040 --> 13:08.460
trailers on there, and you'll see parents in their 40s and 50s, you'll see grandmas

13:08.460 --> 13:16.620
in their 60s and 70s, you'll see little girls, 7, 8, 9 years old, all saying, oh my gosh,

13:16.620 --> 13:21.980
this was the greatest night of my life, you know, oh my gosh, I've never seen a show quite

13:21.980 --> 13:24.820
like this before, I was really blown away.

13:24.820 --> 13:30.880
I came here because, you know, I was dragged here by my boyfriend or the grandmother saying

13:30.880 --> 13:36.060
I was taking my grandson to the symphony for the first time, and those are the people most

13:36.060 --> 13:42.660
blown away by the production because they're astonished at the quality of music.

13:42.660 --> 13:47.180
You know, again, the reason why I created this in the beginning was to prove to the

13:47.180 --> 13:54.020
world how culturally significant and artistic video games, and of course their music, have

13:54.020 --> 13:55.020
become.

13:55.020 --> 14:00.020
And so the best letters and emails that we get after a performance, they come pouring

14:00.020 --> 14:04.460
in, they're all from non-gamers, they're all from the people who are blown away going,

14:04.460 --> 14:09.620
oh my gosh, I never knew that video games were this incredible and the music was so

14:09.620 --> 14:15.780
powerful and the characters and the storylines were so interesting and intense and the graphics

14:15.780 --> 14:24.060
are so beautiful, I get it now, now I understand why my kids are so much into video games.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.780
Thank you for opening my eyes.

14:25.780 --> 14:31.540
So a lot of times, you know, on the website, we'll put in these comments and we'll put

14:31.540 --> 14:36.060
in, we show all of the reviews that we've gotten for the show and all of the comments

14:36.060 --> 14:41.220
and letters from people and non-gamers, and in those reviews, they all kind of follow

14:41.220 --> 14:44.580
the same thing going, well, you know what, I wasn't into video games, I didn't know what

14:44.580 --> 14:46.900
to expect, but wow, you know.

14:46.900 --> 14:51.780
So it's word of mouth that really is the, I kind of compare us a little bit in that

14:51.780 --> 14:57.180
respect to Cirque du Soleil, in that, you know, the first time people had heard of Cirque

14:57.180 --> 15:00.540
du Soleil, I know I was one of them, I was kind of like, what the hell is it?

15:00.540 --> 15:04.380
Is it circus animals running around, clowns?

15:04.380 --> 15:05.380
I don't get it.

15:05.380 --> 15:09.740
You know, it was only until you saw it with your own two eyes or somebody really close

15:09.740 --> 15:15.020
to you explained it in great detail where you start to go, oh, I get it, you know.

15:15.020 --> 15:20.100
So I mean, yeah, you could watch the 1,500 plus YouTube videos that are on there right

15:20.100 --> 15:21.100
now.

15:21.100 --> 15:25.060
You do a search for video games live and they'll all come up, but, you know, a lot of people

15:25.060 --> 15:29.300
always tell us, you know, I watched all the YouTube videos, but until you're there, until

15:29.300 --> 15:36.540
you're experiencing that magic of being in a room with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 people all

15:36.540 --> 15:40.940
experiencing it at once, there's, you know, there's some magic that it goes on, you know.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.940
YouTube is never a substitution for anything like this.

15:43.940 --> 15:44.940
Absolutely.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.060
Well, whatever you guys are doing, however the word is getting out there, obviously it's

15:49.060 --> 15:50.060
working.

15:50.060 --> 15:54.820
Video games live, it's coming up on a three-year anniversary pretty soon, if I'm not mistaken.

15:54.820 --> 15:59.260
But based on what you're saying, you know, ramping up to 120 shows in 2010, it's not

15:59.260 --> 16:00.860
slowing down anytime soon.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.540
What would you say, Tommy, is the biggest accomplishment, the biggest thing you've accomplished

16:04.540 --> 16:07.780
from video games live in its three-year history so far?

16:07.780 --> 16:18.180
Well, you know, I think that I had a dream, myself and my fellow video game composer Jack

16:18.180 --> 16:23.000
Wall who also conducts video games live and we kind of, you know, created the show together.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.520
It took us three years to create the show and in the beginning, we started this in 2002

16:29.520 --> 16:34.640
and everyone thought we were completely insane and completely crazy.

16:34.640 --> 16:44.940
So I would say that our biggest accomplishment is, you know, is getting this thing up and

16:44.940 --> 16:49.860
running to the point where, you know, I mean, I could point to certain singular things that

16:49.860 --> 16:55.580
happened like, for example, our first show ever was at the Hollywood Bowl on July 6,

16:55.580 --> 16:58.100
2005 with the L.A. Phil.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.700
Over 11,000 people showed up to that show.

17:02.700 --> 17:05.960
People thought, you know, two or three thousand people were going to show up or whatever.

17:05.960 --> 17:13.980
So I mean, you know, I mean, what an accomplishment to say that we, our first show ever with that

17:13.980 --> 17:19.780
quite arguably the most famous stage in the entire planet, you know?

17:19.780 --> 17:20.780
And there's other things.

17:20.780 --> 17:24.500
I mean, you know, we were the first to play in Canada, the first American concert to play

17:24.500 --> 17:31.540
in Asia, the first to play in Brazil and places like Spain and London, England and, you know,

17:31.540 --> 17:33.540
I mean, there's New Zealand, things like that.

17:33.540 --> 17:39.300
I mean, I could point to a lot of those things, but I just think the idea that this is, you

17:39.300 --> 17:44.420
know, surviving and growing at the rate it is, I think when everyone in the beginning

17:44.420 --> 17:49.200
told us we were insane and crazy and it would never work, you know, that's the greatest

17:49.200 --> 17:50.780
accomplishment for us.

17:50.780 --> 17:54.700
And kind of building on that, because you talk, you've talked about all these places

17:54.700 --> 17:59.980
you've been and that you're the kind of the first video game concert in Canada and the

17:59.980 --> 18:02.780
first concert in Asia and things kind of keep growing.

18:02.780 --> 18:06.740
I mean, through these latest tour dates, you guys are going to Germany, China, Thailand,

18:06.740 --> 18:07.740
Portugal.

18:07.740 --> 18:10.100
I mean, your passport is probably very impressive.

18:10.100 --> 18:14.700
I got to wonder, how do you select the places that you're going to go?

18:14.700 --> 18:18.660
How do you decide we're going to do this in Asia or we're going to go to Portugal?

18:18.660 --> 18:20.760
How do you pick where you're going?

18:20.760 --> 18:21.760
That's a great question.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.460
A number of different ways, actually.

18:24.460 --> 18:32.020
We've now grown to a point where people are now, you know, knocking our doors down trying

18:32.020 --> 18:33.020
to get us.

18:33.020 --> 18:42.420
So, you know, the people in China contacted us and we're going to do, we're doing Beijing

18:42.420 --> 18:44.300
and Hong Kong, multiple dates.

18:44.300 --> 18:48.260
You know, the people from Singapore contacted us, you know.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.260
It's a great thing.

18:49.260 --> 18:53.200
In terms of all the places in the United States, you know, we had a really important show at

18:53.200 --> 18:59.420
the end of April where it was our debut on Broadway in New York City, you know, and a

18:59.420 --> 19:03.460
very important thing for any act or performance.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.460
And we sold out the show three months in advance.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.740
And so that was a huge accomplishment.

19:08.740 --> 19:15.060
What that does is that sends messages to all of the other promoters and cities and symphonies

19:15.060 --> 19:17.580
and buyers of this material.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.380
It sends out a strong message.

19:19.380 --> 19:21.380
And so they start knocking down our doors.

19:21.380 --> 19:27.120
So at this point for us, all we're trying to do is, you know, kind of take all of these

19:27.120 --> 19:32.100
things and put them in at some kind, make some kind of sensible routing or sensible

19:32.100 --> 19:36.540
order and, you know, figuring out, okay, which ones do we pick?

19:36.540 --> 19:42.380
Like for example, if the San Diego Symphony contacts us, oh, hey, let's do it during Comic-Con

19:42.380 --> 19:43.580
in San Diego.

19:43.580 --> 19:48.380
You know, the German promoters contact us, well, geez, let's do it during Leipzig Game

19:48.380 --> 19:49.380
Convention.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.780
Indianapolis Symphony, let's do it during Gen Con.

19:51.780 --> 19:58.020
So we always try to, you know, work in maybe around some kind of conference.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.620
But I'll tell you an interesting story, though.

20:00.620 --> 20:05.860
I got an email from a 17-year-old girl in Taipei, Taiwan.

20:05.860 --> 20:14.380
And she wrote me and said, hey, I would like to get a petition going to bring video games

20:14.380 --> 20:15.380
live to Taiwan.

20:15.380 --> 20:19.580
It would be the very first video game concert ever in Taiwan.

20:19.580 --> 20:25.500
And she asked if she could use our logo and things to start a petition.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.860
And she wanted to make up flyers and pass them on.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.860
I said, sure, absolutely.

20:28.860 --> 20:33.820
And I thought it was kind of cool and adorable, you know.

20:33.820 --> 20:42.940
But two weeks later, she contacts me, and she has an Excel spreadsheet and a link that

20:42.940 --> 20:44.480
I could follow.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.360
And she says, hey, look, been working really hard.

20:47.360 --> 20:53.340
We have over 2800 people who have signed up, signed the petition.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.300
Here's all their email addresses.

20:55.300 --> 20:58.180
Here's the link and all the comments that they've left back.

20:58.180 --> 21:03.360
And I'm like, how the heck do people know about video games live in Taiwan?

21:03.360 --> 21:05.160
And she says, oh, through YouTube.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.100
We all get together and watch it.

21:07.100 --> 21:12.580
It's kind of this underground community thing where they check your show dates.

21:12.580 --> 21:17.380
And then the day after the show, people watch all the videos that people post on YouTube.

21:17.380 --> 21:20.020
And they feel like they're part of the event.

21:20.020 --> 21:25.060
So I pass this information on to one of our booking agents in Asia.

21:25.060 --> 21:27.900
And within two weeks, we got a big promoter.

21:27.900 --> 21:31.740
Because of this girl, we were doing two shows in Taipei now.

21:31.740 --> 21:36.820
That's the cool thing about video games, though, if you think about it, and video game music

21:36.820 --> 21:43.660
specifically, is that you could go, and we've hopefully proven this, you can go anywhere

21:43.660 --> 21:45.260
in the world.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.820
And video games are popular.

21:47.820 --> 21:48.820
You know?

21:48.820 --> 21:50.220
I mean, think about that for a second.

21:50.220 --> 21:54.580
There's not a lot of music out there that you can say the same thing.

21:54.580 --> 21:59.460
Like, for example, the Dave Matthews bands might be super popular in America.

21:59.460 --> 22:02.840
They might sell out 20,000 seat stadiums.

22:02.840 --> 22:06.060
But when they go to Germany, maybe not so much.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.940
Or when they go to Spain, no one knows who they are.

22:08.940 --> 22:11.620
Or Korea, no one's heard of them, right?

22:11.620 --> 22:13.220
And the reverse is true.

22:13.220 --> 22:16.980
European bands try to break you here all the time, and people have no idea who they are.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.300
They just never really catch on.

22:18.300 --> 22:19.300
Exactly.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.340
And the same with Japan as well.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.020
Whereas video games, music.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.540
What a universal thing.

22:25.540 --> 22:33.300
Now, although the game popularity might change from region to region, like in the US here,

22:33.300 --> 22:37.140
we might play Halo as our big grand finale.

22:37.140 --> 22:42.500
But maybe down in Brazil, where the PlayStation is a lot more predominant, and not so many

22:42.500 --> 22:48.780
Xboxes, maybe a game like Castlevania or Nintendo is big down there as well.

22:48.780 --> 22:52.780
So maybe it's Mario or Castlevania down in Brazil, you know?

22:52.780 --> 22:58.100
And so it's really been a learning experience and an eye-opener for me.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.820
To take Brazil, for example, is a great example.

23:00.820 --> 23:01.820
We went down there.

23:01.820 --> 23:03.940
We had three weeks of sold-out shows.

23:03.940 --> 23:08.620
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and Brasília, which is the capital.

23:08.620 --> 23:14.260
And they, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people a night, screaming at the top of their lungs, you know,

23:14.260 --> 23:19.900
so much so that our front-of-house mixer couldn't even hear the symphony when he was trying

23:19.900 --> 23:20.900
to mix it.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.100
It's like, I hope this sounds good.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.620
I mean, the passion down there for stuff like this is off the charts.

23:26.620 --> 23:29.900
But you never hear about gamers in Brazil over here.

23:29.900 --> 23:30.900
Why?

23:30.900 --> 23:36.040
Because, and you never see Brazil at the top of any, you know, marketing lists or lists

23:36.040 --> 23:39.700
about how many gamers there are in Brazil and this and that.

23:39.700 --> 23:40.700
Why?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.240
Because it's all black market down there.

23:42.240 --> 23:47.700
You know, 99% of all the games that are sold, companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft

23:47.700 --> 23:54.980
and EA and Activision, they don't even distribute games down there because it's all, or hardware,

23:54.980 --> 23:56.860
because it's all black market.

23:56.860 --> 24:02.220
But because it's so easily accessible and because it's so cheap, there's more hardcore

24:02.220 --> 24:08.880
gamers down there than I've seen and experienced in other parts of the world, you know.

24:08.880 --> 24:13.940
And even, like, down in Mexico, we played a smaller town in Mexico a couple months ago.

24:13.940 --> 24:16.580
It was at the end of March.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.820
We played a 7,000 seat bull ring in Mexico, Mexicali, Mexico.

24:20.820 --> 24:26.420
It wasn't Mexico City, which is the biggest city in the world, which people may not, 30

24:26.420 --> 24:28.620
million people.

24:28.620 --> 24:29.620
And same with Brazil.

24:29.620 --> 24:30.700
We play Sao Paulo.

24:30.700 --> 24:35.460
It's the second or third biggest city in the world, like 28 million people.

24:35.460 --> 24:41.220
But even in a smaller town like Mexicali, Mexico, which I think has a million people,

24:41.220 --> 24:44.980
you know, there were 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 gamers who showed up.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.860
You know, it's funny, Tommy.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.740
One of those people that were there at that concert in Mexicali actually called us that

24:51.740 --> 24:52.740
next weekend.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.740
Oh, really?

24:53.740 --> 24:54.740
Yes.

24:54.740 --> 24:57.180
He's one of our listeners at Deft and he said he had a great time at the show, can't wait

24:57.180 --> 24:58.260
to go back.

24:58.260 --> 25:02.260
And that was kind of leading to my next question, which I think you might have already answered,

25:02.260 --> 25:04.740
talking about the girl from Taipei.

25:04.740 --> 25:08.260
But if there's somebody who wants this event to come to their city or come back to their

25:08.260 --> 25:12.220
city, what do you think is the best way for them to kind of go about doing this?

25:12.220 --> 25:15.500
I mean, I don't know if you want to get a partition from every city, but what do you

25:15.500 --> 25:19.220
think would be the best way for somebody to get this back to their town?

25:19.220 --> 25:24.100
We actually put this in the FAQ on our website as well because we get asked that same question

25:24.100 --> 25:26.900
by so many people.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.980
And the other question that's asked a lot is, how do you pick which music to play for

25:31.980 --> 25:34.540
different cities or countries that you go to?

25:34.540 --> 25:38.360
So it's really a two-part answer.

25:38.360 --> 25:44.500
The first question is, we have a mailing list on the front page, it's Video Games Live mailing

25:44.500 --> 25:45.500
list.

25:45.500 --> 25:51.020
We don't spam people, we send out something maybe once every couple of months, or if it's

25:51.020 --> 25:56.260
coming to your area, we'll geo-target your area to let you know that pre-sale tickets

25:56.260 --> 26:02.340
are going on so that Video Games Live folks can get them before the general public does.

26:02.340 --> 26:07.420
But on that, there's a thing that says, let us know what games you want to hear.

26:07.420 --> 26:13.020
And what we do is we take that list and it spits out an Excel spreadsheet for us for

26:13.020 --> 26:14.140
that area.

26:14.140 --> 26:20.040
So I can geo-target a 200-mile radius around the city that we're going to, and it will

26:20.040 --> 26:24.500
show me, out of all the people who signed up for the mailing list, what they want to

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
hear most.

26:25.500 --> 26:30.780
So each show we do, we have our standards, if you will.

26:30.780 --> 26:35.980
Every show, we're going to play your Final Fantasy and Halo and Warcraft and Mario and

26:35.980 --> 26:40.660
Zelda and Kingdom Hearts and Sonic and all that stuff.

26:40.660 --> 26:44.880
There's certain games we like to play every single show, although we change them from

26:44.880 --> 26:47.100
year to year.

26:47.100 --> 26:53.180
But then when you start to replay about 20 segments in an evening, that constitutes about

26:53.180 --> 26:55.560
a two-and-a-half hour presentation.

26:55.560 --> 27:04.660
So one night, if we're in France, for example, and the game Beyond Good and Evil was created

27:04.660 --> 27:10.620
by my good friend Michel Ancel at Ubisoft in France, we're going to play Beyond Good

27:10.620 --> 27:11.620
and Evil.

27:11.620 --> 27:16.100
And in fact, or we'll play it like we played in Montreal in February, because that's the

27:16.100 --> 27:18.980
North American home office of Ubisoft.

27:18.980 --> 27:24.660
We played Ubisoft games and had some of the creators there.

27:24.660 --> 27:29.500
It will last, this past weekend we were in Las Vegas, so we did the world premiere of

27:29.500 --> 27:33.180
Command and Conquer, because the game was made right there.

27:33.180 --> 27:43.420
So, yeah, we have, in Asia, stuff like Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 2 hasn't even come out, but

27:43.420 --> 27:47.180
we're already playing the music and the video.

27:47.180 --> 27:53.660
Games like Warcraft and Starcraft are super huge over in Asia, but not so much down in

27:53.660 --> 28:00.340
Brazil because a lot of people are less about PC gaming and more about Nintendo and Sony.

28:00.340 --> 28:05.580
So down in Brazil, stuff like Metroid and Castlevania is huge down there.

28:05.580 --> 28:13.660
So we vary, but we really listen to the fans from that area to decide, and if people want

28:13.660 --> 28:20.260
to bring our show to their city, we also have an email address, info at video games live

28:20.260 --> 28:27.060
dot com, and we collect all those emails and normally someone will get back to you within

28:27.060 --> 28:28.060
24 hours.

28:28.060 --> 28:32.460
Excellent, I hope not only act deaf, but all of our listeners who are hoping to get video

28:32.460 --> 28:36.500
games live in their backyard are successful with that.

28:36.500 --> 28:39.140
Speaking of listeners going to the show, I have to bring this up.

28:39.140 --> 28:42.540
This might be a little silly, but I got to ask it, it's kind of funny.

28:42.540 --> 28:46.180
One of our listeners, DJ Jenai, wrote us on a previous show and he was talking about the

28:46.180 --> 28:50.900
video games live tour stop in Las Vegas, raved about the show, said he had a great time,

28:50.900 --> 28:54.660
but one part that kind of cracked me up is he specifically mentioned that you change

28:54.660 --> 28:56.940
outfits quite a bit during the show.

28:56.940 --> 29:00.380
Are you coordinating your wardrobe to match the games?

29:00.380 --> 29:05.620
I'll tell you exactly, and I'll explain it, and again it's a great question.

29:05.620 --> 29:11.180
I'm Cher up in this motherfucker, no, I'm like Cher, I got to change everything, Madonna,

29:11.180 --> 29:18.220
Britney, no, there's three times, I have two and a half hour performance, I host the show

29:18.220 --> 29:25.220
of course, as I mentioned, and I want to be respectful to the symphony and the people

29:25.220 --> 29:30.340
on stage, but by the same token I'm also, you know, I've been a video game composer

29:30.340 --> 29:36.560
for 18 years, so I might come out in an Armani suit, but I might be wearing, you know, Nike

29:36.560 --> 29:40.420
sneakers and a Spiderman shirt underneath, or a Mickey Mouse shirt underneath, or whatever,

29:40.420 --> 29:50.420
so I don't know what you'd call it, casual, whatever, I don't know, casual talks or something,

29:50.420 --> 29:51.420
I don't know.

29:51.420 --> 29:56.740
But at the beginning I, you know, kind of do that, and then we have a 20 minute intermission,

29:56.740 --> 30:05.300
and I come back and now the shirt's on buttons, the, you know, the coat tails might be off,

30:05.300 --> 30:12.500
we're going to turn on the lights a little bit for this segment, and then at the end

30:12.500 --> 30:17.500
I come out with a guitar, and it would look silly of me to be wearing a suit and playing

30:17.500 --> 30:24.380
guitar, so by the encore I'm kind of in, you know, a little bit more rock and roll gear,

30:24.380 --> 30:30.180
if you will, and so yeah, so I changed three times, once at the beginning to be kind of

30:30.180 --> 30:33.460
more formal, and then it kind of evolves into not so formal.

30:33.460 --> 30:37.260
Alright, well that makes sense, thank you for helping to explain that, alright, it was

30:37.260 --> 30:39.260
a very important question about Video Games Live.

30:39.260 --> 30:40.260
No worries, no worries.

30:40.260 --> 30:44.260
Alright, no, this really is an important question about Video Games Live, a lot of people are

30:44.260 --> 30:49.100
wondering, is there a CD at some point in the future, or some type of digital distribution,

30:49.100 --> 30:51.220
iTunes, question mark?

30:51.220 --> 30:58.060
Absolutely, in fact it's something that was supposed to come out last fall, and then we

30:58.060 --> 31:02.500
held, we kind of, the record company made the decision that they didn't want it to come

31:02.500 --> 31:07.940
out during Christmas, because, you know, Christmas season, because they didn't want it to get

31:07.940 --> 31:12.260
lost and all the, you know, the great games that always come out around that time, so

31:12.260 --> 31:17.700
then we, we're going to delay it to the first quarter of this year, you know, we're thinking,

31:17.700 --> 31:23.500
oh, maybe come out like around, you know, February or March instead, after all the Christmas

31:23.500 --> 31:30.340
hype had subsided, but then we're working on some new great pieces, at the time I was

31:30.340 --> 31:35.500
working on, because a lot of people also, they email us to say, or they'll all talk

31:35.500 --> 31:39.240
to people after the show during the meet and greet, and I always ask, hey, how can we improve

31:39.240 --> 31:44.260
the show, is there something that you want to hear that we don't play in the show, and

31:44.260 --> 31:50.260
I was getting just bombarded by like, you know, Metroid and Castlevania, which we hadn't,

31:50.260 --> 31:54.300
you know, we had done an orchestral version of Castlevania, but I was never happy with

31:54.300 --> 31:59.740
it, because I think, you know, Castlevania music needs to really be like a combination

31:59.740 --> 32:04.100
of symphony and rock and roll, that's how I wanted to present it in my mind, and so

32:04.100 --> 32:10.380
I was working on this Castlevania thing, and I was just like, man, I really want to, I

32:10.380 --> 32:19.300
want to get this on the album, so I asked, you know, I asked EMI, who's one of the biggest

32:19.300 --> 32:23.180
record companies in the world who's putting the album out, you know, I kind of begged

32:23.180 --> 32:27.940
and pleaded to say, hey, could we, you know, could we delay this again and add a couple

32:27.940 --> 32:32.980
more tracks to the album that I think will be really special to gamers, you know, including

32:32.980 --> 32:39.020
this, you know, this Castlevania piece, and they said, yeah, no problem, sure, you know,

32:39.020 --> 32:45.220
so the album is officially going to be released in physical form around the world, too, not

32:45.220 --> 32:51.140
just in America, not just on iTunes, I'm talking about all over Europe, all over Asia, it's

32:51.140 --> 32:58.580
the first time ever that a video game compilation album is being released by a major record

32:58.580 --> 33:04.020
company around the world, it's never happened before, and the licensing, if you can imagine

33:04.020 --> 33:10.820
the licensing, you know, going through companies like Halo, I mean, Microsoft for Halo, and

33:10.820 --> 33:16.220
Ubisoft for Myst, and, you know, Konami for Castlevania, I mean, it got to be, you know,

33:16.220 --> 33:21.040
it was a bit of a nightmare at first, because no one had ever really done anything like

33:21.040 --> 33:25.500
this before, same thing we encountered, that's why it took us three years to get the first

33:25.500 --> 33:29.300
concert in order, because no one had ever done it to the scale and size that we were

33:29.300 --> 33:35.580
doing, but, so, it's going to be released all over the world, July 22nd is the release

33:35.580 --> 33:41.380
date here in America, which we're coinciding, and another reason we wanted to delay it is

33:41.380 --> 33:48.560
because we wanted to, we wanted to launch it at a special, for different special events,

33:48.560 --> 33:53.620
so for example, the reason it's being released in July, that's the week of Comic Con, and

33:53.620 --> 34:00.060
we're opening Comic Con with the San Diego Symphony, right there on the grounds of Comic

34:00.060 --> 34:06.260
Con, right next, at the Embarcadero, on the water, outside shows, San Diego Symphony,

34:06.260 --> 34:12.540
so many special guests, but we're also having synchronized fireworks as well for that show,

34:12.540 --> 34:18.100
and so this is all in celebration as well of our album being released that week, so

34:18.100 --> 34:21.900
we wanted to wait for something big, and that was the one.

34:21.900 --> 34:28.220
In terms of our European release, we're going to do that, we're playing a 7,000 seat stadium

34:28.220 --> 34:34.700
in Leipzig, it's the Leipzig Arena, right there during the Games Convention in August,

34:34.700 --> 34:39.380
so we're going to wait to release the album in August in Europe, you know, have it be

34:39.380 --> 34:45.140
around a big press and marketing event and things like that, and then in Asia, we're

34:45.140 --> 34:48.500
going to be releasing it right around the time of the Olympics, where we're playing

34:48.500 --> 34:52.980
in Taipei in the beginning of August, and that's when we're going to do the big release

34:52.980 --> 34:59.860
there, the very first video game concert ever in those countries, China and Taiwan, so,

34:59.860 --> 35:06.700
but that being said, it's also going to be available for download on iTunes before the

35:06.700 --> 35:13.320
physical release comes out, and it's also going to have special content and special

35:13.320 --> 35:20.960
songs that are not on the physical CD as a kind of a special bonus.

35:20.960 --> 35:25.820
Very cool, and you know, we here at OLR, I think we can all agree we're very comfortable

35:25.820 --> 35:30.820
with you delaying the CD to incorporate Castlevania, because that game is incredible, and the music

35:30.820 --> 35:33.740
is awesome, so we're fine.

35:33.740 --> 35:41.180
It's like when Miyamoto, I worked with Miyamoto on Metroid Prime, and I've known him for many

35:41.180 --> 35:48.240
years, he's such a great guy, and he once told me, you know, when I said, well how do

35:48.240 --> 35:53.620
you know when the game is done, you know, like do you have a schedule, he says, you

35:53.620 --> 36:02.400
know, the game is released when I'm finished with it, you know, and that's why Halo 2 gets

36:02.400 --> 36:08.140
delayed a couple years, Zelda gets delayed a couple years, Half Life 2 comes out two

36:08.140 --> 36:14.520
years, three years later, whatever it is, but you know what, don't you wish all game

36:14.520 --> 36:19.960
companies and game makers and game developers had that same sense about it.

36:19.960 --> 36:26.840
Why is Halo Halo, and Half Life Half Life, and why any Miyamoto product is what it is,

36:26.840 --> 36:33.980
it's because they refuse to let anything out that's not perfect, you know, or the best

36:33.980 --> 36:35.900
it could possibly be at that time.

36:35.900 --> 36:40.360
We feel the same way, we don't want to just rush out an album, we were making Castlevania,

36:40.360 --> 36:46.440
it's like, man, I gotta get this on, it's a really popular track that we love to perform.

36:46.440 --> 36:50.200
And you're absolutely right, in gaming, you know, a lot of people get very frustrated

36:50.200 --> 36:53.600
with these delays sometimes, but you know what, sometimes it's for a good reason.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.040
So you know the funny thing about that too is that you'll notice like people will bitch

36:57.040 --> 37:02.920
and moan like crazy when it keeps getting delayed, and then the second those games come

37:02.920 --> 37:06.760
out, I worked on Metroid Prime, I think we were working on it for five freaking years

37:06.760 --> 37:10.560
or something, with Miyamoto, right?

37:10.560 --> 37:16.200
But the thing you'll notice though is when the game comes out, and it's freaking perfect,

37:16.200 --> 37:19.400
you never hear any complaints ever again about it being delayed, right?

37:19.400 --> 37:24.560
It's very true, everybody seems to forget, everyone seems to forget the second the day

37:24.560 --> 37:25.560
comes out.

37:25.560 --> 37:29.400
Well Tommy, I know it might be a little late for requests for Video Games Live CD Volume

37:29.400 --> 37:34.280
1, but seeing as this thing's going into 2010, I think a Volume 2 is going to be an inevitability

37:34.280 --> 37:35.280
at some point.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.740
A Silent Hill, keep that in mind.

37:37.740 --> 37:39.680
We love Silent Hill here at OLR.

37:39.680 --> 37:47.280
Akira is a very good friend of mine, he's joined us on stage a few times, most recently

37:47.280 --> 37:54.360
in Los Angeles last year during the E4ALL Expo, and we did a big show there, 5,000 people

37:54.360 --> 38:04.760
where we opened the Nokia, it's called, LA Live is the area, but the Nokia Center.

38:04.760 --> 38:09.720
I remember that Tommy, I was in LA, and I wanted to go to the show, I was stuck doing

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
work, I couldn't do it.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.480
I was so mad.

38:12.480 --> 38:17.160
Well you could have met Akira right there, if you like Silent Hill, he was part of our

38:17.160 --> 38:18.420
meet and greet as well.

38:18.420 --> 38:23.680
Not only Akira, I had him on stage, I also had the creator of Dance Dance Revolution,

38:23.680 --> 38:30.360
and also the dude who created Castlevania as well, Iga, was also part of the meet and

38:30.360 --> 38:31.400
greet there as well.

38:31.400 --> 38:36.560
But yes, Silent Hill, get a little, what do you think, in Laura's theme?

38:36.560 --> 38:40.400
Maybe just the theme from the very first game, that really haunting little melody in the

38:40.400 --> 38:45.320
beginning, and the kind of like, upbeat as it goes through, just the classic, or, I don't

38:45.320 --> 38:49.220
know, I'm kind of partial to the soundtrack for Silent Hill 4, I don't know what my co-host

38:49.220 --> 38:52.160
would say about that, I think they're all about Silent Hill 2, but...

38:52.160 --> 38:58.880
You know the tough part, it's something to think about too, from my end, is that, like

38:58.880 --> 39:04.740
the music from Silent Hill is a perfect example, where certain games, it's very hard to translate

39:04.740 --> 39:09.960
to a live performance, especially when you're talking about a symphony on stage, Silent

39:09.960 --> 39:12.000
Hill is one of those games, you know?

39:12.000 --> 39:15.920
I'll tell you, the other game that was very, very challenging, and I didn't want to put

39:15.920 --> 39:20.040
it in the show until I figured it out, was Metroid, right?

39:20.040 --> 39:24.480
Because everyone loves Metroid, and we were getting so many requests for it, but it's

39:24.480 --> 39:28.720
like, how do you do Metroid with a symphony, you know?

39:28.720 --> 39:33.560
And so what we, I mean I don't want to spoil it, but people can check it out on YouTube

39:33.560 --> 39:39.500
or whatever anyway, but what we did with Metroid is we decided to, let's try to create that

39:39.500 --> 39:44.880
beginning, that everyone knows and loves so much, let's try to kind of recreate those

39:44.880 --> 39:52.840
electronics and bleeps and bloops with the symphony, you know, and add in the electronics,

39:52.840 --> 39:58.100
add in the original sounds from the game, and play those live with the symphony as well,

39:58.100 --> 40:03.360
to kind of give it this really super-duper retro feel, because if you try to just do

40:03.360 --> 40:08.960
it with instruments, it sometimes doesn't translate, you know, so we're really happy

40:08.960 --> 40:14.240
with the way the Metroid segment turned out, and it's been a really popular segment for

40:14.240 --> 40:15.240
us.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
Excellent.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.240
Excellent.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.960
I can't wait to see it myself, hopefully in San Jose.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.840
One thing, I want to kind of ask you about some of the other stuff outside of Video Games

40:24.840 --> 40:27.920
Live, I know we're kind of longer than we anticipated in the beginning, that's alright,

40:27.920 --> 40:30.400
we're having a good time, I wanted to ask you about some of your other stuff besides

40:30.400 --> 40:33.480
just Video Games Live, let me take another listener question here.

40:33.480 --> 40:37.720
One of our listeners, Dark Tetsuya, wanted to know, do you have a favorite piece that

40:37.720 --> 40:40.760
you've ever worked on for the video game music that you've composed?

40:40.760 --> 40:42.040
Sure, yeah.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.320
There's actually two, I'm going to go with two, actually.

40:45.320 --> 40:53.920
The stuff that I did for Earthworm Jim is some of my favorite stuff, and more so, not

40:53.920 --> 41:00.800
necessarily even from a composing standpoint, but from a, just a silliness standpoint in

41:00.800 --> 41:06.080
terms of like, when we were working on Earthworm Jim, there was like ten guys in a room, all

41:06.080 --> 41:08.040
trying to make each other laugh.

41:08.040 --> 41:12.960
That was Video, or that was Earthworm Jim, that's what we did, we had a year to make

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
each other laugh.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.080
And you totally can't tell from the way it turned out.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.960
Yeah, right?

41:18.960 --> 41:24.920
And so, you know, that was such a great experience, and just doing it so, so differently, of course

41:24.920 --> 41:30.000
that team had been together for a long time, we worked on the original Terminator game,

41:30.000 --> 41:34.760
we did Global Gladiators for the Genesis, then we did Cool Spot, then we did Disney's

41:34.760 --> 41:39.680
Aladdin, and then we did Earthworm Jim 1 and 2, and then MDK after that, before everyone

41:39.680 --> 41:45.760
kind of started their own companies, but that was such a great experience, so I would say

41:45.760 --> 41:50.320
if I had a personal favorite, that would be it.

41:50.320 --> 41:57.980
But in terms of composition, though, I feel as a composer that the favorite stuff that

41:57.980 --> 42:03.600
I've composed is probably Advent Rising, and some of the music in there, because I've always

42:03.600 --> 42:09.100
wanted to write like an Italian opera, and so when Advent Rising came across, and it's

42:09.100 --> 42:18.400
too bad that the game didn't do well at all, and it's a shame, but I was really happy with

42:18.400 --> 42:22.560
the way the music composition turned out in that, and it was something I've always wanted

42:22.560 --> 42:27.000
to do my whole life, and so I really put my heart and soul into that score.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.960
Well, hopefully people will get a second chance to check that out if it ever makes its way

42:29.960 --> 42:30.960
to the Xbox originals.

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
Yeah, there you go.

42:31.960 --> 42:36.400
All right, well, one other thing I want to ask you about, we mentioned kind of towards

42:36.400 --> 42:39.780
the beginning of the interview, you also, you know, not just do this Video Games Live,

42:39.780 --> 42:44.720
you also are the chairman of Game Audio Network Guild, or GANG, it's like a network of people

42:44.720 --> 42:49.520
basically involved with gaming music, voiceovers, sound designers, what's GANG up to this year?

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
What is GANG doing this year?

42:50.520 --> 42:57.440
Well, the biggest thing, the biggest thing that GANG has just done, last week in fact,

42:57.440 --> 43:06.280
was launch version 3.0 of our website, which is a complete networking mass, I mean it really,

43:06.280 --> 43:12.360
you know, the third word in GANG, network, right, the Game Audio Network Guild, this

43:12.360 --> 43:17.000
was always our dream to have this kind of portal and website available, I mean think

43:17.000 --> 43:27.760
of like, you know, Myspace meets, you know, the Game Developers Association, you know,

43:27.760 --> 43:35.280
the IGDA or, you know, gamasutra.com, right, those great websites out there, so, I mean,

43:35.280 --> 43:40.960
you know, networking is so important in our industry where, you know, so much so that

43:40.960 --> 43:45.160
I always, when I talk to people about, you know, people trying to get in the industry

43:45.160 --> 43:50.200
or give speeches at schools or whatever, is that I always say that, you know, the creative

43:50.200 --> 43:58.600
aspect of what you do is only about 50% of it, the other 50% is networking, so instead

43:58.600 --> 44:04.520
of, you know, and I say that to any, you know, musician, instead of practicing piano for

44:04.520 --> 44:10.640
ten hours a day, if you practice that for five hours a day and then you take the other

44:10.640 --> 44:17.320
five hours and use that to network and to get to know people and to send emails or to,

44:17.320 --> 44:22.760
you know, help better yourself or your personality or, you know, whatever, so, you know, people

44:22.760 --> 44:28.960
have to, you know, I think one thing that I've learned is that it, you don't necessarily,

44:28.960 --> 44:35.600
it's not all about talent, you know, it's about 50-50, so, you know, gang launching

44:35.600 --> 44:42.680
this new website is really, you know, we have over 2,500 members in over 30 countries around

44:42.680 --> 44:47.720
the world, we have scholarship programs for people looking to get in the industry, we

44:47.720 --> 44:55.000
focus not only on the creative aspects of video game audio but also the technical aspects

44:55.000 --> 44:59.840
and the business aspects as well because that's also very, very important and those three

44:59.840 --> 45:06.240
things are key to being, you know, successful in the game audio industry but, you know,

45:06.240 --> 45:12.000
there's apprenticeships and mentorships and, you know, for people looking to get in as

45:12.000 --> 45:18.240
well, so that's our biggest thing is launching this new site, we're always working with schools

45:18.240 --> 45:25.120
and universities all over the world on creating game audio curriculums for colleges and universities

45:25.120 --> 45:30.480
and, by the way, some of these colleges and universities are places like Berklee School

45:30.480 --> 45:36.960
of Music in Boston, places like UCLA and USC, I mean, some of the finest schools in the

45:36.960 --> 45:43.240
world and even some specialized colleges, accredited colleges, you know, places like

45:43.240 --> 45:49.960
Full Sail in Florida, for example, or Guildhall in Texas or Expressions in San Francisco,

45:49.960 --> 45:55.600
so, you know, working, it's been a passion of mine from the beginning to really, you

45:55.600 --> 46:03.240
know, help the game audio industry have more respect and to educate not only each other

46:03.240 --> 46:08.120
as composers and sound designers but also to educate the developers and the publishers

46:08.120 --> 46:13.640
as well because when I first got in this industry almost 20 years ago, they didn't care, they

46:13.640 --> 46:19.080
didn't give a crap about video game audio, you know, it was so like, you know, I mean,

46:19.080 --> 46:24.320
a typical day in the office, you know, back in the early 90s would be somebody walking

46:24.320 --> 46:30.880
in my office saying, okay, the game's done, we don't have any music, we don't have any

46:30.880 --> 46:36.040
money or budget, we don't have any space left on the cartridge and, oh, yeah, we got to

46:36.040 --> 46:40.880
submit this in two days so we don't have any time either, can you make something sound

46:40.880 --> 46:46.000
like something, whatever, here, you know, that was basically how you did game audio

46:46.000 --> 46:51.480
back then. Now, of course, you know, it's completely changed and I think one thing that

46:51.480 --> 46:56.840
you'll notice in the industry is that since Gang's inception back in, you know, the turn

46:56.840 --> 47:04.080
of the century, you've seen the quality of audio and music go through the roof and that's

47:04.080 --> 47:10.100
not just because of the technology, you know, you know, Gang, you know, should take a lot

47:10.100 --> 47:16.120
of credit for that, for educating all those things, for educating them about, you know,

47:16.120 --> 47:22.480
5.1 audio or, you know, budgets for live orchestras and how and why it makes a difference and

47:22.480 --> 47:27.720
being involved from a project from the beginning, not just tailing it off at the end, it's not

47:27.720 --> 47:32.620
post-production like film and television, what we do is so much different and so much

47:32.620 --> 47:39.220
more interactive and providing the proper tools for sound designers and composers to

47:39.220 --> 47:45.040
do what we need to do. These are all things that Gang does on a constant basis behind

47:45.040 --> 47:50.520
the scenes, you know, some of our sponsors are EA and Dolby and some of these colleges

47:50.520 --> 47:57.880
and schools and THX and, you know, all these DTS and, you know, all these amazing companies,

47:57.880 --> 48:04.320
Microsoft and Intel and AMD and, you know, chip manufacturers and things. So, you know,

48:04.320 --> 48:09.920
everybody believes in the message, it was just a matter of everyone banding together

48:09.920 --> 48:14.940
and coming together as one to get that message out there as a group of people and that's

48:14.940 --> 48:19.780
really what Gang is all about. Of course, we have our Gang Awards as well each year

48:19.780 --> 48:25.640
where we have about 25 different categories, you know, everything from best sound design

48:25.640 --> 48:32.300
of the year to best music of the year or best song for a video game, best licensed music

48:32.300 --> 48:38.600
for a game, you know, there's best cinematic sound in a game, so there's all sorts of different

48:38.600 --> 48:43.240
things that we award as well. And Bioshock cleaned up pretty much last year.

48:43.240 --> 48:46.800
Yeah, I read that well deserved on them though.

48:46.800 --> 48:47.800
Absolutely.

48:47.800 --> 48:51.640
If we have any musically inclined folks listening to the program, I know we have a few that

48:51.640 --> 48:55.160
are interested in this, it's audiogang.org, correct?

48:55.160 --> 49:00.280
That is it, audiogang.org. If you're looking to get in the industry doing game audio, that's

49:00.280 --> 49:02.400
the first great place to start.

49:02.400 --> 49:06.760
All right, well, Tommy, I got one more question for you and thank you so much for spending

49:06.760 --> 49:10.720
the time here with us tonight, but we always ask this, all of our guests we bring on the

49:10.720 --> 49:14.600
program, it's the way we start off our show every week, we always talk about our gaming

49:14.600 --> 49:19.120
weeks and the types of games we've been playing this week and what we've been enjoying. So,

49:19.120 --> 49:22.760
Tommy, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games you've been into lately?

49:22.760 --> 49:32.800
Fantastic. No, it's funny because yesterday was Father's Day. We're taping this interview,

49:32.800 --> 49:39.520
but I don't know if I said it or not, but yesterday was Father's Day. And so, me and

49:39.520 --> 49:48.000
my dad and my brother, we played the game Buzz on PlayStation 2. It's just basically

49:48.000 --> 49:53.200
a trivia game. My dad isn't a huge gamer these days. He was when I was growing up. We'd always

49:53.200 --> 49:57.880
go to the arcade and play Asteroids and Space Invaders together in the late 70s when I was

49:57.880 --> 50:06.200
like 10. And he was a huge kick-my-ass and Pac-Man every night. But now, he's gotten

50:06.200 --> 50:12.440
out of it. So, we played Buzz. I played Buzz this week. I played a little rock band this

50:12.440 --> 50:19.720
week. But also, this might get people a little jealous. I've been playing Metal Gear Solid

50:19.720 --> 50:27.120
4, of course. I've been playing that for a couple weeks due to having some friends in

50:27.120 --> 50:33.720
some high places and getting versions before other folks. But the thing I've really been

50:33.720 --> 50:39.320
playing because I've been working on putting this segment together for Video Games Live

50:39.320 --> 50:44.520
is Guitar Hero Aerosmith, which hasn't hit the shelves yet, but I've been playing a lot

50:44.520 --> 50:46.080
of that lately as well.

50:46.080 --> 50:49.120
So something Guitar Hero related is coming to Video Games Live?

50:49.120 --> 50:55.480
An interactive segment with Guitar Hero and Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. His real name

50:55.480 --> 51:01.680
is Steven Telerico. He's my cousin. We've been always talking about doing something

51:01.680 --> 51:08.680
together and ended up getting them hooked up with Activision to get that product on

51:08.680 --> 51:15.800
the market the first time ever. A band has its own music video game with Guitar Hero,

51:15.800 --> 51:18.520
so we're all really proud of that.

51:18.520 --> 51:23.880
Yeah, I'm going to put together, wouldn't it be cool if somebody could come up on stage

51:23.880 --> 51:32.360
and play a song from Guitar Hero Aerosmith while playing along on the big screen with

51:32.360 --> 51:37.600
the orchestra and with some live musicians on stage as well? Wouldn't that be cool?

51:37.600 --> 51:41.920
That would be awesome, and thankfully it's Aerosmith and not that Dragonforce song from

51:41.920 --> 51:45.800
Guitar Hero 3, because then I think we'd all like, you know, I would want to lose in front

51:45.800 --> 51:50.240
of all those people. Aerosmith I think I could probably handle. I know those songs pretty

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
well.

51:51.240 --> 51:57.480
Well, Tommy Telerico, the man behind Video Games Live, the man behind Gang, and the soundtrack

51:57.480 --> 52:00.480
to so many video games. Thank you so much for spending the time tonight here on Orange

52:00.480 --> 52:05.560
Lawns Radio talking about everything, and best of luck to you through the next few dates

52:05.560 --> 52:06.560
of your tour.

52:06.560 --> 52:12.800
Thank you, and I really appreciate you taking the time to help spread the word, because

52:12.800 --> 52:20.760
I think what you guys are doing are so important to us and the growth of this thing, and talking

52:20.760 --> 52:26.200
about it really helps us out in helping to spread the word, so thank you.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.480
No problem, Tommy. Best of luck to you.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.680
Okay, thanks.

52:30.680 --> 52:34.640
Thank you so much to Tommy for taking the time to talk to us here at Orange Lawns Radio.

52:34.640 --> 52:39.640
It was a lot of fun. He's pretty chatty, but a lot of really insightful information about

52:39.640 --> 52:41.000
how the whole process works.

52:41.000 --> 52:46.720
And it's funny, because I didn't believe it when he said it, Steven Tyler's last name

52:46.720 --> 52:47.920
is actually Telerico.

52:47.920 --> 52:51.040
Yeah, I kind of thought it was a joke when I first heard it too. That's why I didn't

52:51.040 --> 52:56.380
follow up on that at all, but no, it is true. He is actually related to Steven Tyler, which

52:56.380 --> 52:58.480
means he's also related to Liv Tyler.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.640
All right, anyhow.

53:00.640 --> 53:01.640
Hey.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.640
What?

53:02.640 --> 53:04.880
So, you can be related.

53:04.880 --> 53:10.400
Yeah, it's just kind of neat. I kind of thought he was joking. Like, oh yeah, he's my bro.

53:10.400 --> 53:14.080
He's my cousin. You know, that type of thing. I was just very surprised.

53:14.080 --> 53:17.360
And it's so funny, because, you know, Loki, you exclaimed something like, if it's not

53:17.360 --> 53:22.840
on Wikipedia, it's not true. And then he went to Wikipedia, and I just heard, oh. I guess

53:22.840 --> 53:23.840
it is true.

53:23.840 --> 53:30.360
All right, anyhow, we've got some more gaming news to cover. I know you guys on Skype are

53:30.360 --> 53:33.360
eager to call in, so we want to get to you guys as well. We have a few more stories for

53:33.360 --> 53:35.320
you guys quick, though. We'll start off with Loki.

53:35.320 --> 53:40.120
Okay, well, last week, you know, the PSP got firmware 4.0. Well, of course, they couldn't

53:40.120 --> 53:47.240
leave it just like that, so they put out 4.01, which, you know, is just, I guess, to make

53:47.240 --> 53:54.560
sure that 4.0 was working correctly. And updates as far as, doesn't really say what, they improved

53:54.560 --> 53:57.920
some of the search features, I guess. And that's about it.

53:57.920 --> 54:02.360
Well, I don't know if they were trying to stop the homebrew stuff, but, like, pretty

54:02.360 --> 54:08.400
much the very next day, the custom firmware 4.01 was released, so.

54:08.400 --> 54:16.360
Yeah, Peaker Junior92 in chat says, or PK Junior, I want to say it really fast, 4.01

54:16.360 --> 54:17.360
is a joke.

54:17.360 --> 54:18.360
Yeah.

54:18.360 --> 54:24.640
Just like 911 is a joke. 4.01 is a joke. Maybe that could be a hit new song. 4.01 is a joke.

54:24.640 --> 54:31.080
Oh, I forget it. Not a joke. The whole annoying digital rights management thing on the Xbox

54:31.080 --> 54:37.400
Live, guess what? They have finally fixed it. There is a new DRM tool, digital rights

54:37.400 --> 54:44.440
management tool that is available on Xbox site, on the Microsoft site. This is originally

54:44.440 --> 54:48.440
going to be a part of the next patch or the next release, but it's actually available

54:48.440 --> 54:53.740
now. It's available on Xbox.com. You can manage the digital rights contents of arcade titles

54:53.740 --> 54:57.920
that you've downloaded and so on. I haven't used this myself, but I should, because my

54:57.920 --> 55:02.560
original Xbox 360 died of the red rings of death, so I have this awkward digital management

55:02.560 --> 55:06.680
thing with Geometry Wars and Joust, which were the first two arcade titles I ever bought.

55:06.680 --> 55:09.840
So I should go in and try to fix that. So now you don't have to go through this whole

55:09.840 --> 55:13.680
mess of getting the points credited back to you and all this stuff. In fact, you can see

55:13.680 --> 55:17.560
the three-step process here. Make sure you've signed into Xbox Live with this account and

55:17.560 --> 55:21.480
whatever your name is. Go to the Xbox Live Marketplace and select Account Management,

55:21.480 --> 55:25.840
Download History. Select an item and then select Download again. Repeat step three for

55:25.840 --> 55:30.640
each item in your download history. There you go. So if you're willing to re-download

55:30.640 --> 55:37.320
the stuff, you can use the tool on Xbox.com to do it for you. And certainly that saves

55:37.320 --> 55:45.480
customer service, a crap load of phone calls. So everybody wins in this scenario. Yay.

55:45.480 --> 55:51.240
I win. What did you win? I win a story. Oh, and what would this story be about?

55:51.240 --> 55:57.680
Well, okay, everyone knows that one of the coolest voice actors in the world, in my opinion

55:57.680 --> 56:04.080
anyway, is David Hader. You know, he has written movies, done a fairly good job with the first

56:04.080 --> 56:09.880
X-Men movie, actually with the first two X-Men movies since he did the screenplays. But he

56:09.880 --> 56:15.720
is actually looking for a petition out to get all of the fans to sign so that he writes

56:15.720 --> 56:23.440
the Metal Gear movie. Interesting. Well, honestly, I would have to think that he would know Snake

56:23.440 --> 56:30.680
better than just about anybody except maybe Kojima. Or so many other people on Kojima's

56:30.680 --> 56:35.320
team. But I think, though, that when you're the person who puts the personality into the

56:35.320 --> 56:42.760
character, I think that you would have a bit of insight into how to properly write for

56:42.760 --> 56:50.240
that character. So I think it's pretty cool. Well, I kind of wonder, what kind of writing

56:50.240 --> 56:55.480
creds does he have? Well, I just said that he wrote the screenplays for the first two

56:55.480 --> 57:04.920
X-Men movies. Oh, sorry. It's okay. And he's doing an adaptation of Watchmen. But he's

57:04.920 --> 57:15.680
actually looking to have everyone actually email a rep at Sony Pictures. The address

57:15.680 --> 57:19.080
is, and I'm going to go ahead and say it on the air, because honestly, I would love for

57:19.080 --> 57:27.880
him to write the movie. He does a good job. But it's Matt, M-A-T-T underscore T-O-L-M-A-C-H

57:27.880 --> 57:35.040
at S-P-E dot Sony dot com. So send those emails in and actually use good grammar. Please spell

57:35.040 --> 57:40.080
check for the win. This is a really good opportunity for us to try and get David Hader on the show.

57:40.080 --> 57:43.320
I know I'm going to email. I'm gonna see if you realize I'm going to be sitting in the

57:43.320 --> 57:48.520
corner fan gasming the whole fanning yourself actually really good looking to see what we

57:48.520 --> 57:54.620
can do about that. In a reference to the video that we saw the other day and no one else

57:54.620 --> 58:02.720
will get blurred fluids. Nobody's going to understand that. What? YouTube joke. What

58:02.720 --> 58:07.560
was I going to say here? Some comments here in the chat room. DJ Dark Knight says as long

58:07.560 --> 58:14.700
as he plays him. You never know. Going back to the last story, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf,

58:14.700 --> 58:17.420
our next door neighbor on All Games wanted to point out about the whole digital right

58:17.420 --> 58:21.480
management tool. You can only use it once every 12 months. You have to manually re-download

58:21.480 --> 58:25.000
every title. If you have a lot of titles, it's going to take you a couple hours to get

58:25.000 --> 58:28.720
all that stuff. Again, you can only use the tool once every 12 months. But that should

58:28.720 --> 58:32.480
be enough. I mean, how many people get more than one Xbox a year unless you really get

58:32.480 --> 58:36.900
screwed with the red rings of death? I mean, certainly it could happen. But iTunes has

58:36.900 --> 58:40.600
a similar policy. I think you can reset your iTunes digital rights management like once

58:40.600 --> 58:44.640
a year as well. But of course, then again, you can also install the music on like four

58:44.640 --> 58:51.640
different computers. Something like that. Awesome. Well, remember there was a big to-do

58:51.880 --> 58:57.760
about the whole hot coffee crap in Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas. And then there was a settlement

58:57.760 --> 59:02.320
where people could possibly get money for not even having purchased Grand Theft Auto.

59:02.320 --> 59:07.860
But you know, you just have to pretend that you did. Well, the response to the whole thing

59:07.860 --> 59:14.860
was really only 2,676 claims. You didn't say 26,000, you said 2,000. 2,676. And how many

59:17.960 --> 59:22.740
people bought Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas? Approximately 12 million. Eleventy billion?

59:22.740 --> 59:29.740
So that apparently is approximately 0.022% of the consumers that actually were offended

59:31.260 --> 59:35.720
and upset from the content in the game. In other words, people looking for a free lunch,

59:35.720 --> 59:41.160
courtesy of Take-Two from McDonald's. And essentially that equals up to about only $1.3

59:41.160 --> 59:48.160
million in fees. Oh, I'm sorry. Only about $30,000 in claims from all that. And apparently

59:51.680 --> 59:58.680
the suit seeking $1.3 million in legal fees. That's funny. Wow. Just wow. If I had the

59:58.680 --> 01:00:05.680
stupid award music still cute, I'd probably play it right about now, but unfortunately

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.360
I left that party. See, everyone was complaining that it was such a big deal and everyone was

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.360
making a big deal. You know who that 0.22% or 0.022% was? Jack Thompson and his family.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.360
Fucking media. And just people blowing the shit out of proportion. People wanting to

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.680
see if it worked or not. Yeah. Seriously, out of those 2,000, how many just wanted to

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.960
see if it would work? That's what I'm curious about. If they got money. Did anybody in our

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.400
chat room do it? Probably not. Alright, well one other bit of news for you and then we're

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.760
going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio and

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.800
it is a PlayStation story and it's about the PlayStation Network specifically. I'm surprised

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.840
neither one of these games has been the classic game of the week yet, but maybe soon. After

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.700
all, they are going to make a resurgence pretty soon. Einhonder and Xenogears are now going

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.200
to be on the PlayStation Network. I like Einhonder. I'm surprised. We still need Zweihander.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.640
I'm surprised Xenogears is on there since I think it's a multiple disc game. Well, hey,

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:09.040
they've got a lot of storage space on that PlayStation 3. So anyhow, you can now download

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.840
these songs. You can download these games on the PlayStation Network and there you have

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.640
it. They're being sold right now in Japan. Sorry, you can't do it here. It's being sold

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.440
for 600 yen a piece. That's about $5.56. Not bad. But unfortunately, both these games are

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.320
pretty text heavy, so you would probably need to understand Japanese. Not Einhonder. You

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.960
just fucking kill things. I'm looking right at Xenogears as I'm saying. Xenogears. Xenogears,

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:38.360
yeah. But if you know Japanese, hey, there you go. By the way, Squeenix USA has commented

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.480
there is currently no plans to bring this to the American Network. Yeah, well, we'll

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.720
see. Money talks, people. Money talks. And now you talk. 1877 Game OLR. Our username

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.920
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to the Skype line. The calls are already coming

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.920
in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? There is currently no plans to bring

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.240
this to the American Network. I'm hearing myself. Are you there? Talks, people. Money

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:07.800
talks. Okay. Please call Echo 1-2-3. If I hear myself or Dark Soccer or Loki on the

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.560
call, that's grounds for immediate hang up. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.440
Hey, hey, it's Ranma. Hey, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy? Hello. Hey, everyone. I

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.960
know what you were doing last night. I know what you were doing last night, too. Tell

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:27.600
us about it. I know what you did last night. Well, besides getting, uh, drunk with freeze

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.960
pop. Wait, so, when you say, you don't mean you were actually getting drunk at a freeze

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.220
pop concert, although that is probably true as well. You actually went out and got drunk

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:42.640
with freeze pop the band. Yes, this is what actually happened. I was at a broom party

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.300
having a good time and I left, you know, to bring some more alcohol up and I was going

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:51.880
up the stairs and I saw them and the girl, I think it was Elizabeth, she said, um, is

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:57.720
there a party going on? I'm like, yeah, follow me. Follow me right into the, um, party and

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.440
we've been partying ever since. And right now I'm actually downloading all the pictures

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.760
from the party with them as we speak. Did you remind them that OLR loves them muchly?

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:13.440
Yes, I did. In between shots. Nice. I doubt they even remember us. Only one of them came

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.680
on the show, but you never know. So that's what, were you just Liz or the whole band

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.560
or what? The whole band. That's awesome. So there you have it. Doing shots with the band.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.280
Did they happen to let slip any, uh, things they might have coming up in the game world?

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.940
You know, I read recently one of their emails that went out to everybody, there was a little

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.880
bit of freeze pop controversy about the fact that their song, uh, I am not your game boy

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.680
is on guitar hero DS because it's actually not by harmonics anymore. Right. But, and

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.360
so they wanted to kind of clear the air that, Hey, they're loaning their songs out to, you

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.720
know, or no, the deal was that I think if I remember I read it on their site, they don't

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.320
get paid when they're in their harmonics games. Um, they do it just, you know, for the love

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.840
of harmonics for the love of those games, but they were getting paid by Konami when

01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.760
it was in DDR by Sony, you know, branded games and by, you know, the folks who did guitar

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:06.360
hero on tour. So yeah, a little, a little freeze pop controversy. I thought I'd clear

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.400
up. Well, they really are talented. I mean, after seeing him the second time, it was really

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.800
awesome. They really deserve more. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. That's yeah. They they're

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.400
destined for stardom eventually, you know, they're, they're on the brain. Everybody knows

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:26.360
some of their songs from rock band and all that stuff. So, well, they did a new song

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:32.040
at the concert. Oh really? Yeah. They covered a popular song from the eighties as an encore

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:41.040
song. What was it? The final countdown. Nice. And um, that's definitely key to our friendly.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.920
Definitely. Hey, that could be, you never know rock band too. Maybe who knows? Um, Hey,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.720
here's the thing though. Next time you go drinking with Liz, since now you like have

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.080
her number in your black book or whatever, tell them that a OLR would love a new theme

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.320
song, you know, no disrespect to midi head, but we've been using the opening song now

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.960
for like two years. So we're looking for something new. So just the thought, I may be able to

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.040
do something. I know somebody knows somebody, so I may be able to cash in a favor. So I

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.720
would love you forever. All right. What else is going on in your world? Anything else you

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.680
want to update our listeners on real quick? Well, you're ready to drink this weekend.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.400
Oh my God. That's right. You're coming to town. No, I can't drink. I could drink cider

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.560
and milk. Okay. I'll drink cider with you. Okay. I can't hear your cider will probably

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:30.520
be special cider. Oh, we'll get the, uh, the, um, uh, Blackthorn for us. No, I'm looking

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.240
forward to you being in town and uh, I'm looking forward to the 4th of July party when we're

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:41.120
going to set things on fire. Yes. Oh yeah. Rob. Yes. I have a surprise for you. Yay.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.000
I like surprises. I'm going to present it next week. If I can be on the show, of course

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.460
you can be on the show. I thought you were already coming to the show. Just want to make

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:55.560
sure, you know, so Rama will be here in studio next week. All right. So until then I'm hanging

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:02.140
up on you. Cause you have all next week to talk to us. All right. Later. That's right.

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:07.520
That is next week. Isn't it? God time flies. That means I have to do, I'm going to be busy

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:14.080
this time to clean the house. Well, I already, I, my house is pretty clean. I just got to

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.280
change the cat litter. You okay over there, Loki? Sorry. I'm just getting this working.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.520
I heard myself. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Uh, J rod. Hey, Jay rod.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.260
What's on your mind, buddy? Uh, just asking you guys, what are you looking forward to

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.320
for you three of the most. So it's right around the corner. What am I looking forward to E3

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.940
the most? You know me personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how much of Microsoft press

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.640
conference really did get spoiled. I'm looking forward to all the press conferences. I love

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.360
sitting there not working and reading the press conferences. I really am looking forward

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.820
to seeing if animal crossing MMO or we or whatever. I'm looking forward to seeing if

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.780
animal if it is true that animal crossing is coming back to Nintendo and what they're

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.640
doing with it. I J I am so freaking curious is killing me. And of course I want it to

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.760
address the space issues so I gotta say Nintendo's press conference I'm

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.100
definitely looking forward to

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.360
Sony I don't know what I'm looking forward to hearing from Sony but

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.100
sometimes they really surprise you on left field so I don't think you can

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:11.960
predict Sony

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.520
Microsoft if the rumors are true they're gonna have an interesting press

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.320
conference ahead of them

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.640
I'm also looking forward to seeing how the absence of these companies is gonna

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.880
play into the E3 reports this year with all these

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.560
companies dropping out. Loki, Dark Sakura, anything you wanna add?

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.880
No, they'll just have pretty much like Activision so since they're not gonna be

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.000
there they'll probably have their own little press conference that'll

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.720
take place at the same time. I mean it'll pretty much be the same damn coverage.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.160
I still think that they made a mistake with cutting out the

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.880
fanfare I just think they should have been a bit more discerning as to

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.240
invitations that's all.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.000
Very disappointing but have you looked at the Penny Arcade

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.840
exhibitor list? Now that I'm happy about. That's doing it right.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.040
You wanna hear something that really would piss you off?

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.880
My company got one invite to E3 and they said oh forget it we're not going.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.440
I'm like you fuckers. You fucking whores.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.320
Okay Jayrod I'm turning the tables a little bit what are you looking forward

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.360
to seeing at E3?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.860
I am looking forward to Gears of War 2. That is my main game for this year.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:18.160
Gears of War 2 and I wanna see how the new Silent Hill is turning out.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.320
Oh I'm kinda iffy about that one. Apparently

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.040
and I haven't seen this myself but a buddy was telling me about this that

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.880
apparently the first 10 minutes of the game are out there on the internet and it

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.720
looks pretty good.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.080
I don't wanna spoil anything. I'm gonna have to pass on that.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.320
I don't either but you know I'm curious. But yeah Gears of War oh man people are

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.480
just loving that first game.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.520
That'll definitely be a centerpiece of Microsoft's press conference. Probably the big final

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.040
thing they'll show since there's no

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.120
Halo this year. That's probably their second biggest franchise I can think of.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.280
Chat room is asking about Kid Icarus Wii.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.040
If it's true which I think it might be I'm definitely curious. That is another

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.880
curiosity.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.120
I'm trying not to get my hopes up too high because I just have this really bad

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.800
feeling. I'm gonna look at it and go

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.040
ew it's so different.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.600
Something tells me they're not going the Mega Man 9 route and giving us a new

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.640
retro game.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.200
So that's what I think about Kid Icarus.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.200
Alright well J-Rod thanks so much for the call. Anything else you want to share

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.280
really quickly?

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.120
Alright well have a good one.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.120
Appreciate it. I had Italian today.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.240
Did you? Yes I had Mary's Pizza Shack.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.640
I thought you couldn't have pizza. Well I can't but on

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.360
they have pasta dishes there and there was a pasta dish with marinara because I can

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.560
usually have like light marinara pastas.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.800
So it was good times. Alright I better hang up on J-Rod. Bye bye.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.960
Thank you very much. Did you really want to hear us talk about Italian food the whole time?

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.200
Osfer says I saw a trailer for the new Silent Hill. It looked really scary.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.120
I hope so. There's not

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.320
that many games I'm excited about right now but that Silent Hill 5 is one of

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.920
them. That game is supposed to be out sooner rather than later so we shall see

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.000
very soon.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.960
What do you guys think? You want to do one more call? One more quick call?

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.120
Alright. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:11.240
Hola. Bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.120
Echo 123. Is it that hard?

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.800
Alright. That's it. We're closing the Skype line.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.760
I can't deal with the lack of Echo 123 tonight.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.200
Alright. I guess that's gonna do it.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.800
We're gonna go around and wrap it up. First we gotta get some last minute stories.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.800
Do I have a last minute story? I see you giggling over there. I'm just in a giggle

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.760
giggle mood. Why? Because I am. You can't be happy.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.480
It's not allowed. I can be as happy as I want to be Rob.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.400
And I'm gonna whine so that you have to put up with it.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.000
No I don't. Neener. Loki you have any last minute stories?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.120
Uh. You did? Yes. Alright then read it. Stop your bitching.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:00.120
This is

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:03.360
a story that Sauce gave me

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.720
like an hour ago or so that

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.040
Apple Corps has given the okay

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.240
for a computer game to be released based on the Beatles.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.800
Since they own the master recordings. Really? Yep.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.160
Very interesting. And they are

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.960
trying to decide who's gonna get it and they are between Activision and MTV

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.000
games.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.480
Oh snap.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.040
Is that for real? That is crazy. Alright.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.920
We'll see. Loki you have any last minute stories?

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.040
Um. I don't know.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.640
No. Not really. Really? Wow. Yeah well I haven't been looking at

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.480
last minute stories. I've been working on other crap. Apparently Catwoman is gonna be

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.800
Marvel vs. DC Universe and she has

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.160
a lot of cleavage apparently. Surprise.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.880
Tigerclaw mentions in chatroom. By the way Sky you know that Bill Gates

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.440
officially retired.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.080
Yes. But he'll still always be kind of like a mascot of sorts to that company

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.880
don't you think?

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.320
I mean he's gone but he's not. You know what I mean? Well didn't he drop out of

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.640
high school and start his own company?

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.040
Hey you know what? Just a day's dedication. Seriously?

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.280
Just a day's dedication. Alright well. He dropped out of college that was it.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.880
Yeah. Well so did I and look at me I'm on the internet with the

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.880
radio program with my friends. Hey. Winners don't use drugs.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.160
Alright let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.120
Loki what's your final thought tonight? I fucking hate

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.200
PHP.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.320
My final thought is I

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.400
really want another piece of ice cream cake

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.560
because the one I cheated with on my birthday and had was really

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.560
really really fucking good. Dark Soccer your final thought tonight.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.120
I really want some creme brulee right now. Oh my fucking god creme brulee is the shit.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.040
I'm gonna go get some creme brulee ice cream I think.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.720
Since we are orange lounge foodie-o I have to mention real quick. This is our first mention of food tonight.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.160
Olive Garden. Yeah we did have Olive Garden. Here's the thing. Did you know that Claim

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.040
Jumper now has like a healthy menu with

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.320
foods under 600 calories a dish or something? Under 600 calories a dish.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.480
Look for them. Half a day food. For them that's that's really good.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.120
Well a bowl of soup and some of their garlic toast is under 600.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.960
Yeah but now they have like salads and stuff that are really good and under

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.760
under 600 calories. What was I gonna say?

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.840
I don't know but they're really good. Oh they have the creme brulee. They have like a new dessert dish

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.240
that's three of different flavors of creme brulee.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.520
Like the green tea and all that stuff and the little tiny dishes. Do you want?

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:45.040
My god so I do kinda want actually. Although I probably should be good after

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.600
massively cheating on my birthday.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.360
This isn't really a last minute story but it's it's interesting nonetheless.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.840
But apparently there's a price drop on a cat skin for your Wii.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.920
Yes it's a cute little kitten that you can put on your Wii.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.280
I will post it in chat. There you have it.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.840
