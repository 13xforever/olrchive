00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Today, June 15th, 2008, does Nintendo think you are a geek?

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
How can you get your picture in Street Fighter 4?

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:29,760
And many new role-playing games get dated for the Xbox 360.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,480
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Radio.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,640
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,800
and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,520
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,480
Joining us a little late tonight is the one and only dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,240
She's not here yet, but she's en route, so we'll connect with her when she gets here

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,320
to studio.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
But already here and ready to go, the one and only tech master, Loki.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Hello.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
How you doing, Loki?

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm doing fine.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
All right.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,760
Gosh, I guess there's not a lot to say.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,560
We don't have a lot of special guests tonight.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
It's kind of a slow night.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
It was kind of a slow news week up until about two hours ago, which we'll get into in a little

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
bit.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,440
And we're just kind of sitting here waiting for next week, our sixth anniversary show.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,040
We've had some changes in studio.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
I don't know if you can see it on Justin TV.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,680
A lot of people are bitching on Justin TV because it's kind of blurry tonight because

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,360
we just don't have the bandwidth right now to put out a really clear image and the way

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,680
we have things hooked up as a crappy revolution, not revolution, yeah, JTV revolution, TV,

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
TV revolution.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't know, but it looks like complete crap, but hopefully you can make out that Loki finally

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,920
has a real chair.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,280
It's this nice blue little fluffy chair thing going on.

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,120
It's the chair that Jamie used to have.

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,520
She has a couch now.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,360
Yes, because now there is a couch over there.

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,920
Maybe I can show the people on Justin TV about the couch.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
I don't know.

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Maybe if you untangle yourself from the chair there.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
There.

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Can they see that?

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,640
Yeah, they can see that.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
It's a couch.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,760
That's the couch.

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,660
Now I have to fix the camera, so we better start off tonight's show with a little bit

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,200
of how was your gaming week, Loki?

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,320
I didn't play a whole lot this week.

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,280
I meant to, but I just got distracted.

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm 100% complete now with Grand Theft Auto IV, so I've got the achievement and all that

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
fun stuff.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,080
Now, I finally got my video set up at home working, so I'm recording video now of game

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
playing.

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,960
I can do direct feed stuff now, which is cool.

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,200
I tried all these different ways to get my video capture thing to work right, and really

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,020
the only thing that ended up is I needed to bring back my TV, which you may remember was

54
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,840
in the old arcade cabinet, back from work and put it into the computer room.

55
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,320
So now I have a TV sitting on the floor there that I play video on, and it has a video out

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,940
on the TV, and that goes straight to the capture card, and it looks pretty, and it works awesome.

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,920
So what I've been doing, because I got bored on Friday and I was watching some GameTrailers.com

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,640
videos from Grand Theft Auto IV, and some of the glitch stuff that's in there, and one

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,920
of the new glitches that someone found is the evil swing set, and what the evil swing

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,760
set does is if you drive your car up to that evil swing set and leave it there for a second,

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,240
it will fling you way into the air, and it's hilarious.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,360
So I was playing around with that most of the weekend, and recording video, and now

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,620
I've edited it down, and I'm trying to put something together coherent with it, and hopefully

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,960
we'll see a lot more of these things.

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,400
So we might actually have something on our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel.

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,980
Because we haven't had anything on there in like two years.

68
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,800
I think the last thing that's on there is when you and Jamie were interviewed by the

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,580
news station about Guitar Hero 1.

70
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
That's pretty old.

71
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,100
That's the last thing that's on there.

72
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,920
So good, I'm glad to hear we have some updates.

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
That's awesome.

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,400
And I got a video camera too, so I'm hoping I can do some stuff as well, especially with

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
Penny Arcade Expo around the corner, which I still need to book my flight for, I've been

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,880
a very bad boy, but I do plan on going.

77
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
So it'll be fun.

78
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,760
And Blizzcon, Blizzcon's definite as well.

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,700
I did pick up Blastworks this week, and I actually meant to do stuff with it, but Nelly

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,460
was playing Speed Racer a lot this week.

81
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,960
She really has found a game she loves, huh?

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,320
No, she's already bored of it, because she's gotten to a part now where it's so hard that

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,320
she can't go any further, so she's like kind of given up on it and going back to reading.

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,160
But no, I actually have Blastworks, and I meant to do some really cool stuff with it,

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,840
but I haven't quite gotten everything that I need.

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
My setup and everything's all ready to go.

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
I just need to, I don't know, actually sit down and do it.

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,240
Basically, I want to put the Star Fox ships in Blastworks, because it makes sense.

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
Star Fox, very simple looking, and you could probably recreate it pretty simple.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,180
So I'll make some levels out of that, that'd be fun.

91
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,020
But yeah, we already have a thread going on our forums, and people are exchanging stuff.

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,160
There's been some pretty cool stuff already made, like an OLR sign, and the...

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
I haven't seen that.

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,160
I saw the Phoenix Wright one, not Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, I saw the Apollo Justice

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
thing.

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah, you gotta check it out.

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,040
They have an OLR sign, and there is some other stuff on there too, that's pretty funny.

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
So definitely worth checking out.

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,480
Yeah, if you want to see that, just head on to our very archaic website at orangeloungeradio.com.

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,440
We were gonna get a new website, we really need to look into that.

101
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,800
And go to our forums, and you're gonna click on the OLR me clans, and you go to the Blastworks

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,520
custom data thread, and let's see, there's the Apollo Justice, oh look at that, that's

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
cute.

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,800
The OLR billboard made by GS68, that's pretty rad.

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,360
And then some more ships there that he made.

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,800
I like that.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
That's cool.

108
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,840
Yeah, that's one thing I think this game's gonna catch a lot of people by surprise, because

109
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,000
there's so much you can make with it, and there's that online community where you can

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,360
share stuff, download other things.

111
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,160
So once you get done playing the game and unlocking the four other games in it, I mean

112
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,680
you can practically play all new games, you know, forever.

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,320
So it's pretty awesome.

114
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Wow, sounds pretty good.

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,600
Alright, well as far as my gaming week goes, let me see, what kind of stuff have I been

116
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
playing in my gaming week?

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,360
Not a whole lot, because you know, there was World of Warcraft, and we went through all

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,080
of Karazhan in one night, because you know, we're addicted, and Irene called me, and she

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,160
was like, Rob, Karazhan.

120
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
So there was that.

121
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
But I have been playing other games.

122
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,640
I checked out the demo for Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.

123
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,760
This is a game I've been pretty excited about, because if you've listened to this show before,

124
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,160
you know I love old school Civilization, like the very first one that was on the PCs back

125
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,400
in the early 90s.

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I love this game to bits, even as much as most console games.

127
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,540
I mean, it's probably my favorite PC game of all time, certainly.

128
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,720
So I wanted to see how it translated to console, and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed.

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,840
I think they took out a lot of micromanaging that made Civilization really complicated.

130
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I mean, not to say it's bad, because playing Civilization Revolution, I also went back

131
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,000
to go play Civilization 4, which I had skipped, because I wasn't all that big on Civilization

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
3.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,720
I was like, ah, nothing's ever gonna live up to the original.

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
I actually really enjoyed Civilization 4, even though there's more of that micromanaging,

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,860
and you actually have to kind of manage your settlers and all that going on there.

136
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,060
But in Civilization Revolution, they've really kind of, I think, I guess streamlined a lot

137
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,040
of it to make it more accessible to a newbie, and made it just feel more like a casual gaming

138
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
experience.

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,080
I guess maybe that's what it is, it's more, but I feel weird calling Civilization a casual

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
game, because it's really not.

141
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,520
But they made it, I guess, a little easier, but I don't want to say they dumbed it down,

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,720
because Civilization is a very smart game.

143
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
You know what I mean?

144
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,920
I was gonna say that I'm not really looking forward to Civilization, but Red Alert 3 is

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,360
gonna be coming out later this year, and that might be something I have to look at.

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,120
Is that something that's coming out on consoles?

147
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Yes, on the Xbox 360, and I think PC.

148
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,640
So it'll be pretty awesome.

149
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Huge Red Alert fan, though.

150
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,620
I don't know, though, I'm more of the PC Red Alert, because I like cheating my ass off

151
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,680
in that game, especially playing with the rules.ini files and stuff like that, and adding

152
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,520
the school bus of death, and fun stuff like that.

153
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Hmm.

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Alright.

155
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,600
Let's see, other games I played this week, well I guess it was just the Civilization

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,080
4, and then for some reason I had a night of Atari 2600 gaming, thanks to GameTap.

157
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,920
I went back and played Kaboom, and went back and played Freeway, and all these crazy 2600

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,080
games that I remember from the past.

159
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,120
It was all good.

160
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
And that was really it.

161
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,040
I don't even remember what came out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,520
Was this Commando this week?

164
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I think it was Commando.

165
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,120
I think I wanted to check that out, but I just never got around to that.

166
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Alright.

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
Alright, so Dark Sakura is settling in, she just got here.

168
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I hate people.

169
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,520
Sorry, I hate people, too.

170
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,700
I hate people to get in my way.

171
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,040
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

172
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,400
Did you have a good gaming week?

173
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,840
We bought Crystal Castles for the Atari 2600 today, and Dragon's something that's the Genesis

174
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
equivalent of Devil's Crush.

175
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, I don't even know this game.

176
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
I forgot the name, I'm kind of...

177
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm sure a chatter will think of it, chat.orangetonstrategy.com if you want to join in the fun.

178
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,780
And I finally found the one movie I've been looking for that, you know, I've been finding

179
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,960
it expensive, even used, and I was pissed off, but I finally, finally found it for ten

180
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
bucks.

181
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah.

182
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Hypercube.

183
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Oh, okay.

184
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
That's like Cube 3, right?

185
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Cube 2.

186
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Huh.

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,920
If you haven't seen it, you can come over and watch it with me, because it's the awesome

188
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
one.

189
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,440
I haven't seen Cube 2 or Cube 3, I've seen the original Cube.

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,640
Cube would be a pretty badass video game, wouldn't it?

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
I have to tell you, someone has made a Hypercube mod for Half-Life.

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Uh-huh.

193
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Interesting.

194
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,160
I like Hypercube just because it has to do with weird physics.

195
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,200
You know, stuff that Carl Sagan talked about.

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Gameguru in our chat at chat.orangetonstrategy.com says, Keystone Capers for the win.

197
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,760
There's a lot of Atari 2600 left tonight.

198
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,160
What possessed you to go get Crystal Castles for the 2600?

199
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,920
We were at Dimple and it was there, and so we bought it.

200
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,460
Well, alrighty.

201
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,120
And I almost bought Season 5 of Bullshit.

202
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,080
How far can you get in Crystal Castles?

203
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,520
Like, I can only get to like the second set of boards, and like, I guess there's like

204
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,040
10 sets of boards, and I'm like, oh my god, this game is massive, and I really suck at

205
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
it.

206
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,120
Well, the best Crystal Castles player in the world, if you watch the King of Kong video,

207
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
he's in it.

208
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,580
At least he was the last one who got the record on it.

209
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,640
He plays it with his feet.

210
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
Wow.

211
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,680
Like with the trackball, with his feet?

212
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,080
The arcade is sitting in a chair, using his feet.

213
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
That's pretty rad.

214
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,760
I have to say that is pretty, pretty amazing on a stupid computer.

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
So we're always on the cutting edge of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio, playing Atari

216
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
2600 games this week.

217
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,920
I've had plenty of edges of stuff.

218
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,480
Usually paper cuts on the manuals.

219
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,280
Oh yeah, we also had a good bit of Metal Gear Solid 4 being beaten twice over in my house.

220
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,520
That's what the other one was, Frogger 2.

221
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
Oh god.

222
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,760
I think probably better left forgotten.

223
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
I don't know.

224
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
I don't know.

225
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
The Frogger games weren't all bad.

226
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
But I want to hear about, the hell with Frogger.

227
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,560
I want to hear about Metal Gear Solid 4, because I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner.

228
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf live, because you know, he's on live before us over at AllGames.com,

229
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,400
and one of his callers called in to just rave about the game.

230
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,760
Dark Soccer, I know you've been a Solid Snake fan for a while.

231
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
What do you think?

232
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,880
It was pretty epic.

233
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Pretty epic.

234
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,400
And Dan hurt his fingers playing.

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,520
He actually got a cramp in his middle finger.

236
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Wow.

237
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,800
I was like, my man, hardcore gamer.

238
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,680
And I'm sure he's showing it off to everybody.

239
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Look what I hurt.

240
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Look what I hurt.

241
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
No.

242
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
He's been talking about it though.

243
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,880
I have to say though, it's got like the longest fucking ending in the universe.

244
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,440
And it's also the biggest WTF ending in the universe, which I'm not going to say more

245
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
than that.

246
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Right.

247
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
But it has plenty of my man in it.

248
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Solid Snake?

249
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Because I'm like the only one that likes Raiden.

250
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,900
Oh, Raiden.

251
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,200
And on top of that, it's a lot of Raiden kicking ass until he doesn't kick ass.

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,960
And that's not all I'm going to say about that.

253
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:46,960
But I have to say that I'm overall pleased with the project and give Kojima and team

254
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,040
mad props for doing a good job.

255
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,820
I don't know if you can say this without spoiling, so you can say I can't answer.

256
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,660
But does it leave the door open to Metal Gear Solid 5?

257
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Actually yes.

258
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Okay.

259
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
And I'm not going to-

260
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Is there a dog ending?

261
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
That's Silent Hill, dummy.

262
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
It doesn't matter.

263
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
They can branch out.

264
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
All right.

265
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:14,720
But I do have to say that I was sitting in my little hole in the house being the computer

266
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
room.

267
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
You know where I'm talking about.

268
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Right.

269
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Yeah.

270
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
And all of a sudden I hear the Snake Eater theme.

271
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,160
And I'm like, what?

272
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,840
And I just have to say that for fans of the older series, there's major, major nods to

273
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,340
the old Metal Gear series.

274
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:39,720
And I'm not going to tell you what they are, but it's really, really-

275
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Fucking epic.

276
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
And-

277
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,820
The way that they do it is really cool.

278
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,480
And I can't support this game in any way also, by the way, because Solid Snake in the game

279
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,440
uses an Apple iPod.

280
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Oh shut up.

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I don't think he-

282
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,800
No, there is an Apple iPod in there.

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Just shut up.

284
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
What wonderful product placement.

285
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,880
I don't remember seeing any of that going on in the game, because they were too busy

286
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,320
shooting stuff and talking about love on the battlefield.

287
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Love on the-

288
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Love is a battlefield.

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Yeah.

290
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,020
No, it's like this constant spiritual metaphor for-

291
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,880
Do you know what would make Metal Gear Solid 4 better?

292
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Snake not being old.

293
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,560
It's a musical.

294
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Okay the whole-

295
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,120
You know what my subtitle for this game has been?

296
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
What?

297
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,680
It's Metal Gear Solid 4, damn Snake, you got old.

298
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
That's it.

299
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,760
That and WTF towards one of the female characters.

300
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Alright.

301
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I gotta say some comments from chat.

302
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
Ossifer says, I got MGS4 and it's pretty kick ass.

303
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,400
It's the first game I've ever played in the series, but damn, one word describes it.

304
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Epic.

305
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
So you know what I'm talking about, right?

306
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,040
One word goes, well, you haven't played the older ones, but you've got an idea now.

307
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
That's all I'm gonna say.

308
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,880
Careful with putting that mic there, because the fan- Our studio has been rearranged.

309
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,400
I was telling the listeners earlier.

310
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,940
Now Jamie gets her own couch.

311
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm waiting for her to kick her feet up one night and just- It doesn't work there either.

312
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,560
You gotta put it next to you or something.

313
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Where's the ferret?

314
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Where's my baby?

315
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Where's your ferret?

316
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,920
It's in- Your ferret is used in our D&D game, so it's in the house.

317
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,520
You're playing D&D and not tell me?

318
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
You wanna come play?

319
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Sure, I can invite you.

320
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Yeah?

321
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
We're like level four.

322
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh god.

323
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
What?

324
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Oh god.

325
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
I just like- I gained like- I have a level six wereweasel.

326
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,320
50,000 nerd points with our listeners, like I'm the uber nerd now.

327
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,040
I have a level six wereweasel.

328
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm a bard.

329
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I'm a level four bard.

330
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Spoonie bard?

331
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,440
Not quite a- I'm a sassy bard, not a spoonie bard.

332
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,880
My wereweasel has tasted of human before.

333
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,600
But you're- The ferret, because somebody has a ferret familiar in the game, so we actually

334
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
use the ferret as the ferret.

335
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you remember- You remember Mel and Eric from the DDR days, right?

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,320
That's what I need to deal with.

338
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,880
The ferret is Mel's companion.

339
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,280
Well, I will talk to peeps.

340
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,360
Well, if it's on Tuesday, I can't do it.

341
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
It's not Tuesday.

342
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
It's like weekends, usually.

343
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Okay.

344
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
All right.

345
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Cool.

346
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
All right.

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Yeah.

348
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Valerno in chat is asking who's breathing into their mic-

349
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,680
This is the fan thing, and I'm not gonna do anything about it, so shut up.

350
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
It's the fan.

351
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,480
All she has to do is put her mic down, like not on the arm, but on the- Yeah, just leave

352
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
it in your cleavage.

353
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
It'll be fine.

354
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Or put it- Just put it below the arm so the fan's not blowing on it.

355
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
All right.

356
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,360
My face is above the arm line, so I need like a shield over the mic.

357
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
All right.

358
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Forget it.

359
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,400
Xenocore says, Sky, you better be playing version four or you're lame.

360
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,920
We started playing before four was out, because four just came out.

361
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
You know what?

362
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,760
Fuck everybody, because it's all about version two.

363
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Oh.

364
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Two and 2.5.

365
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Why you gotta bring THAC0 into this?

366
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Hell yeah.

367
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,840
I can still calculate THAC0.

368
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,560
All right, look.

369
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,280
We've really gotta get back to video games.

370
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,760
I want to say another quick thing about Metal Gear Solid 4.

371
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,840
I just noticed this on Digg earlier today.

372
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,880
Apparently GameSpot has given Metal Gear Solid 4 a 10 out of 10.

373
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,400
It's only the sixth game in history to do so.

374
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,040
Do you think this is a game that's deserving of all the praise- What if I need to give

375
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
it?

376
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Ah, 40.

377
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
So- Do you think it's deserving- I trust- I trust

378
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,000
fund me to over GameStop- Well, they also gave Nintendogs a 40 if I remember

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
right, so I'm a little- But Nintendogs was great.

380
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
For five minutes.

381
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
But more like five days.

382
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
All right, I'll give you that.

383
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Actually more like five weeks.

384
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Five days.

385
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Because about five weeks is when I started getting tired of it, and I guarantee you a

386
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,520
month from now people are going to be Metal Gear what?

387
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,720
Because people have that kind of attention span that would be none.

388
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,800
Xenocore in chat says fuck Thacko, and Kekoman2Dx says they apparently took bards out of four.

389
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,560
Do fuck fourth edition if that's the case.

390
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,280
Dude, it's- Fuck it right and it's here.

391
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,080
It's all about second edition and playing a freaking, uh, uh, Bladesinger.

392
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
All right.

393
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,640
It's all about it.

394
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Enough D&D chat.

395
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,920
It's all about custom spells and the flesh to toast spell.

396
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
No!

397
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,760
No, the best spell ever, and I have to tell everybody about this.

398
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
My friend- Oh god.

399
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,600
My friend Derek, by the way, congrag- I know you're not listening, but congratulations for

400
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:05,800
getting married, um, last week, um, he, um, had a character named Blackstar who created

401
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,580
a spell called Blackstar's Instant Chaos.

402
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,560
And so far, I think we got to about five pages, but it was supposed to be ten pages of a hundred

403
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,960
effects so the spell would have a thousand effects, random.

404
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
We've had Jesus in our game before.

405
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,800
We've had golf umbrellas pop up.

406
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,400
We have had, um, a Mortal Kombat machine land on a lich.

407
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,580
All sorts of funny things happen in this game.

408
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,160
And also, um, one of my characters actually had a breast enlargement by accident because

409
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
of the spell.

410
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Can we talk video games now?

411
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,640
I just thought I'd share that.

412
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
All right.

413
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,200
The best spell ever.

414
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,880
I do like that and I fully endorse that in any, you know, upcoming RPG.

415
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,320
Oh my god, SSJ100Matt hit the nail on the head.

416
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,360
We substituted food talk tonight with D&D talk.

417
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
At least we're- These french fries suck, by the way.

418
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,880
At least we're getting part way there.

419
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,480
At least we're talking about games of some sort tonight.

420
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,680
I had tiramisu ice cream today.

421
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
All right.

422
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Look.

423
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
And it was great!

424
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,440
We're going to get to talking about video games, but first, some housekeeping news.

425
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,160
A very happy Father's Day to all our gamer daddies who are out there listening.

426
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,200
It is June 15th of 2008 as we're taping this live.

427
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
It is Father's Day.

428
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,240
So, uh, to all of our gamer dads who happen to be listening to the show, happy Father's

429
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,560
Day.

430
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,840
All games dot com was hack sword earlier this week, which kind of sucks.

431
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,680
I don't know why people keep hacking all games dot com because they are only doing good for

432
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,880
the gaming community, but I guess some people want to hack it just because they can and

433
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,560
like the challenge.

434
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,360
So folks are having to listen to us tonight through- directly through all games radio

435
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
dot com.

436
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,940
From what I hear though, all games dot com is completely being redesigned and there's

437
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,520
going to be a complete new site in its place soon.

438
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,560
And I wish someone would do the same for OrangeLaunchRadio dot com because damn our old site's getting

439
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
old.

440
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:01,960
So, um, next week on the show, episode number 284 is the sixth anniversary of OrangeLaunchRadio

441
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,120
if you can believe it.

442
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,840
A day early for all practical sake, but it's the closest day that falls to our anniversary.

443
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,080
The very first episode of OrangeLaunchRadio is June 23rd, 2002, where such topics included

444
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,680
us talking about keyboard mania at our local Roseville Golf Land.

445
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,560
And we've come a long, long way in six years and we're going to be talking a lot about

446
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
that next week.

447
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,320
Although I did put the word out there.

448
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,240
I asked the listeners, what do you want to see for the sixth anniversary of OrangeLaunchRadio?

449
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm very disappointed in the lack of feedback.

450
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
There were like a couple people that made suggestions and when I say a couple, I literally

451
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
mean like two.

452
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,360
So make a suggestion now.

453
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,840
I will be very, very disappointed with you.

454
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Where can they send suggestions?

455
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
In chat?

456
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Mailbag.

457
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
All right.

458
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
It's a mailbag.

459
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
It's a mailbag.

460
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
In chat.

461
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
I can't guarantee.

462
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I'll read it, but you can do it and we'll see what happens.

463
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
All right.

464
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,600
Cause right now we're just going to do the same old shit we've been doing for the past

465
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
six years.

466
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,880
Make a goddamn suggestion before I go into your dreams and stab you in your imaginations.

467
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,440
Have you had a bad day, DarkSakura?

468
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Yes.

469
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
All right.

470
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
I had to go back for my fucking laptop.

471
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,480
All right.

472
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Let's see.

473
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
Rama says, let Travis roast the host.

474
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,520
I don't know about that idea.

475
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,800
I don't know if I could take that.

476
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,520
If he hasn't enough outside the show.

477
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,280
Misty says, but I no has any ideas.

478
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Cry.

479
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Make one.

480
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,320
All right, look, we've got a lot of gaming news to get to tonight.

481
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,160
We have late breaking news.

482
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,320
For all practical purposes, this was a slow news week up until about two, three hours

483
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,520
ago when I think the roof just got blown off of something.

484
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
Now, granted, these are rumors.

485
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,200
Loki, what the hell is going on?

486
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Update us on the latest.

487
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,120
This isn't even on our list of tonight's stories, but this is huge.

488
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
This isn't even.

489
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
I wouldn't say this is rumors.

490
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,240
I would say it's a little bit above rumors since this is actually coming from a survey

491
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,560
site called Intellis, I guess, Intellisponse.com.

492
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:11,640
Apparently my guess is someone got some sort of survey based on one of these news items

493
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,560
and then figured out, hey, look, I can go back in the directories here a little bit.

494
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,040
Oh, look at all this other stuff.

495
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,640
There's everything from mainly Activision and Microsoft stuff.

496
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:32,920
The big juicy stuff, of course, number one being avatars coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.

497
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,800
They actually have a picture of some avatars, including someone that looks like they're

498
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,060
dressed up like Winnie the Pooh, which is kind of weird.

499
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:46,320
It says avatars are digital personas available this holiday for all Xbox Live connected members

500
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,200
and the spring for all new console owners.

501
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,340
Avatars will be used in place of the gamer picture you have today and give you a much

502
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:02,560
more lifelike animated, fully customizable persona for you to reflect who you are online.

503
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Oh, we're getting Miis.

504
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Pretty much.

505
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,160
I would say these are a step up from Miis, but essentially, yeah.

506
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,880
Their Miis second mix.

507
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,160
That's what it is.

508
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,640
Miis club mix.

509
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,600
Yes, exactly.

510
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,920
OK, so let's see here.

511
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,080
There's also information about Guitar Hero 4.

512
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,800
The instrument bundles are supposed to cost one hundred seventy nine dollars with, you

513
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:34,160
know, the same kind of stuff you get in like rock band, drum set, guitar, microphone and

514
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
the game.

515
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
It's supposed to be one hundred seventy nine dollars.

516
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,040
I'd say that's about right.

517
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,360
And some new information about the Guitar Hero 4 guitar.

518
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,400
It will be upgraded and will feature new touch sensitive neck, which will allow you to do

519
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,300
neck slides and opens up the entire guitar neck for unbound solos.

520
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,400
Shred how you want.

521
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,160
And then some of the artists that they mentioned for Guitar Hero 4.

522
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,680
Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne,

523
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,240
Interpol, Muse and dozens more.

524
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,960
And let's see here also, there is some information about remember a while ago, Lips appeared

525
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,760
on a press site for some Microsoft announcement.

526
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
I do.

527
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Yes.

528
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,160
Well, Lips is a music and singing game that's going to include 30 songs and two wireless

529
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,740
interactive microphones, the ability to use and sing your own music or download songs

530
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,460
from an online service.

531
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,760
It's designed to have fun with your friends.

532
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,560
Lips scores you on your singing, pitch, rhythm and tune and overall performance.

533
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,440
The wireless mics are interactive with lights on the shaft of the microphone that pulse

534
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,600
with the rhythm of your voice and motion sensors that allow you to dance and move or swing

535
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
to score points.

536
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,620
And then you can take songs from your CD or iPod and upload them into the game.

537
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:02,320
I'm sure they also mean to say Zune as well since this is an Xbox 360.

538
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,920
And the game will reduce the vocals down so that you can sing along and be heard and score

539
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,020
on whether you're in tune or not.

540
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,600
And lyrics can be added directly into the song to sing aloud.

541
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,640
There is a new Tony Hawk game that's going to be using a motion sensing board controller

542
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,320
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

543
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,200
In fact, I'm going to try to find this here real quick.

544
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,760
This is from a screenshot.

545
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,280
This is from chat while you're looking for that, Game Guru said, tomorrow's news and

546
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,360
tell a response out of business.

547
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,800
I don't know, but people are going to be pissed.

548
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,360
I mean, with all these like news stories coming out, did E3 just get ruined?

549
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,960
A lot of their big, I think big splashes may have gotten ruined a little bit.

550
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
With this whole app.

551
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,560
So we have Microsoft, OK, they've taken the Miis and made it a little better with the

552
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,600
whole avatars thing.

553
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,320
They've taken the whole karaoke revolution SingStar thing and made it a little better

554
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,920
with this lip sing and this whole like that you can put in any song, you get the vocals

555
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
taken out.

556
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,080
That's like a big freaking deal, although it probably won't work perfectly.

557
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,600
That's still kind of a neat feature that the other games don't have.

558
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,160
I mean, this is interesting.

559
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,360
Oh my God.

560
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,400
And this just in, I just saw this and tell a response has also apparently found the theme

561
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,160
song from Microsoft's press conference for E3 this year.

562
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
This is amazing.

563
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:38,280
We have a clip.

564
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
All right.

565
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,880
Anyways, the Tony Hawk game, I guess is the current name right now is Tony Hawk's Adrenaline.

566
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,300
It's going to feature a new motion sensing board controller that takes your game off

567
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,960
the couch and launches you into the ultimate skateboarding experience.

568
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,000
Thanks to an intuitive board based control scheme, it's never been easier to pull off

569
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,520
amazing tricks and feel the sensation of skateboarding.

570
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,480
Shift your weight to turn and balance grinds, kick back on the tail of the board to ollie

571
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
and lean into errors and pull off huge spins.

572
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,520
Feel the sensation of dropping the 60 foot mega ramp bombing down the world's steepest

573
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,520
streets and watching earth disappear behind your board as you launch out of a half pipe.

574
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,920
Question, graphics amplify the fun as you ride thrilling situations like these, put

575
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,000
down the controller step on the board and feel the sensation of going big.

576
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,400
And they say it's going to be 59.99 for the PS3 and Xbox 360.

577
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,560
I'm guessing if it's going to come with a board, it's not going to be that price.

578
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,640
Anyways, let's see here.

579
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,280
What else we got here?

580
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
This is interesting.

581
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,040
I'm not sure what the hell this is though.

582
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,760
It's something called Trioxide and it says, introducing the ability to play the latest

583
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,400
console games, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii on your PC.

584
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:01,280
Many of these games are only available on consoles today and with this new feature,

585
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,760
they will now be available on the PC as well.

586
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,400
This is with this feature, those console games are now playable on your PC.

587
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,120
Use the same game controllers as the original console systems.

588
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,800
All games use regular console controllers, not your computer, keyboard, or mouse.

589
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,720
Now see, I read an interesting theory on that whole thread that was going on on NeoGAF where

590
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,440
this whole thing exploded, that Trioxide was a possible codename for Xbox 360 because they

591
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,960
saw some prices in here, 49 and 299, and people were speculating that maybe 49 is the new

592
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,720
price of the controllers and 299 is this new system skew that a lot of folks are speculating

593
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,680
Microsoft's going to drop on us at E3 because I guess it's not uncommon for Xbox to use

594
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,520
names of like, chemicals, because I think helium was a codename of theirs once.

595
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:54,360
Well, Trioxide, let's see, that would be, um, Ozone, yeah, O3, no, maybe, okay, I think

596
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,200
this is why, I think this is why we're in this territory of, it's rumors, but slightly

597
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,340
above it, you know, like there's got to be some fact to this, I mean, this company is

598
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,080
legit, there's a lot of smoke coming from this, right, but there's, there's probably

599
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,560
some red herrings amongst this because what these people did is they were basically sending

600
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,400
out surveys, marketing research, and that's how this whole thing got blown, is that if

601
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:25,120
you go to one of those websites, ran this whole Avatars thing because it was, somebody

602
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,720
sent it to them confidentially from this website that they were being asked about this whole

603
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,300
Avatars thing on a research, well then that link got taken and some people blew it wide

604
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,200
open and found all the other surveys that were out there too, that's how this whole

605
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
thing started.

606
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,560
I mean, there's some legitimacy to this underneath, but there's still a lot being drafted to it.

607
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,320
Okay, let's see what else we've got here.

608
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,800
Um...

609
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,680
Scenic Pop Culture Edition makes perfect sense since they've already come out with a scenic game there.

610
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,920
The groundwork's already there, so I can see that happening.

611
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,720
Extreme Makeover Home Edition for the Wii and DS.

612
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,960
Uh, I can see that too.

613
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,840
Gossip Girl for the Wii and DS.

614
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,760
What?

615
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,720
Ultimate Band for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

616
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,160
That, if I remember correctly, Ultimate Band, I know for the Wii, is a Buena Vista game.

617
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,320
That's, um, or Disney Interactive, yes.

618
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,880
And that, it is a band game that does not use instruments, and that's something that's already been announced.

619
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,800
You can play Hannah Montana songs to your heart's content.

620
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,400
I guess, yeah.

621
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,640
Uh, Wii Yoga, which I guess is supposed to follow along an inspirational yoga guru, instructor,

622
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,840
machine, all these on-screen poses, stretches.

623
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,320
Wasn't there yoga in Wii Fit?

624
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
Well, this is something else, okay?

625
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,520
So, someone else, I mean, there's a lot of yoga games out there, trust me.

626
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,880
Um, I've seen them, I have to sell them, it sucks.

627
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,280
They have some stuff on Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

628
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,760
Um, a bunch of, you know, because this is a lot of Activision stuff on here, um, in

629
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,240
this new Marvel Ultimate Alliance action role-playing game, civil war erupts, and the world's greatest

630
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,680
heroes and villains must choose sides.

631
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,480
Select your side in the conflict and assemble your team of a roster of 20 Marvel Legends,

632
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,960
including Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, and the Human Torch.

633
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,480
Combine your team's power and the blah blah blah, it says, um, you can also fuse different

634
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,600
powers between characters, such as fusing Spider-Man's powers with Storm to give Spider-Man

635
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,200
lightning webs, so that's kind of neat.

636
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
I do not want.

637
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
That's weird.

638
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Um, so, yeah, and there's some other stuff.

639
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,960
I know, this has already been announced that's coming out, so that's not a surprise.

640
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,680
This is new, though, Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies.

641
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,120
The Marvel Zombies series is just crazy.

642
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Wow.

643
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,480
I don't know if you've read any of them, but they're nuts, and there was an Army of Darkness

644
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,040
vs. Marvel Zombies 2.

645
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
I thought you'd look like that.

646
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,680
So, there's going to be a set in the popular Marvel Zombies comic series.

647
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,960
You assume the role of Spider-Man and must save the world from zombie menaces that threaten

648
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
to destroy it.

649
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,880
Um, play this adventure game in an open city, free-swing environment, and a war-torn Earth,

650
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,240
and the game takes place in the year 2149 in the warped version of Earth.

651
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,600
Um, fight against other Marvel heroes and villains who you've already, who have already

652
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,320
succumbed to the zombie horde, or become a zombie yourself.

653
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,420
So, that's interesting.

654
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,160
I'm guessing that's probably coming out next year sometime.

655
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:21,440
Uh, Transformers 2 probably will suck, because the first one really sucked.

656
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,280
Obviously, this is something that's way far away, but probably going to come out around

657
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,960
the time of the next movie.

658
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,960
So, I think that was 2010, so, way, way off there.

659
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,840
And they have some generic stuff on that, um, let's see here, um, okay, this is a little

660
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
bit bigger.

661
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Well, actually, this is weird too.

662
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,480
They have a balance board game using, or it's a Spider-Man game using the balance board.

663
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,280
It says, um, it might be Spider-Man's heart that keeps him going, or maybe his strength.

664
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,360
Step on, or step into Spider-Man's shoes and decide for yourself.

665
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,480
One jump, leap, stomp, and kick at a time.

666
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,600
Climb atop your Wii Fit board to control Spider-Man's acrobatic abilities like never before.

667
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,160
Lean one way or the other to send Spider-Man's story into the air.

668
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,720
Jump as high as you can to propel, uh, Spider-Man off of Manhattan's tallest rooftops.

669
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,840
I don't see how you could do that, because they don't want you jumping on the Wii balance

670
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
board, so, it'll be interesting.

671
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,760
Hmm, that's true.

672
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,640
Um, let's see here, Tiger Claw says the sequel is going to be called Transformers 2 Revenge

673
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,120
of the Fallen from our chat room.

674
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,680
Uh, then they had some stuff for Call of Duty 5, mainly 5 different box shots so that they're

675
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,800
deciding between, um, what they want to use, same with the Spider-Man web of shadows.

676
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,560
Finally the biggest one, um, this is coming from Forza 3, they had some stuff on that.

677
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,800
Forza 3, of course, you know, big racing game, uh, it says do the number of cars and tracks

678
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,120
included in Forza 3, it will be sold as a 2-disc set, it says, uh, key features of Forza

679
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,760
3 include highly detailed real world cars and track models, over 400 cars and 100 tracks,

680
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,040
near limitless customization options for cartooning and custom artwork, a variety of online community

681
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,080
features, highly accurate racing simulation, including real world damage, new race modes,

682
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,560
drag, drift, oval, point to point racing, etc., uh, powerful assist system to help new

683
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,200
players get into the game quickly, and, what else?

684
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,520
But all that is subject to change, obviously, because he's probably thinking that, yeah.

685
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,200
Yeah, this is all stuff that's going on right now, and it says also imagine that an exclusive

686
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,440
Forza 3 limited collector's edition was released that would include the full version of the

687
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,480
game plus membership in a special VIP program that would entitle the buyer to all future

688
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,380
Forza 3 downloadable content, access to exclusive online race events and prizes, VIP status

689
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:59,420
on Forza auction house and community boards, extra service space for photos and videos

690
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,000
in a free month of live, and the collector's edition will also include exclusive motorsports

691
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,840
content not found anywhere else, and it says this can be anything from authentic racing

692
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,400
gear, gloves, helmets, etc., to specially created automobile and manufactured gear,

693
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,760
branded jackets, etc., to VIP motorsport event tickets.

694
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,840
See, that sounds kind of cool, but like, this stuff's so early that it's probably just,

695
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,480
you know, what they want to do, and they're also kind of getting people's opinions on

696
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
this stuff.

697
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,760
You know, and if you dig even deeper in that NeoJF thread, people kept finding more stuff

698
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,600
on that site, like, I don't know, I didn't read into how the security hole was opened

699
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
or whatever, but.

700
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,760
It basically, well, I saw it earlier before they took everything down.

701
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Oh, it's fixed now?

702
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,420
Because, yeah, it is fixed now, and there's some other stuff that was on there too, including

703
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:54,700
there's a game for, it was called Crucible that they had a video for.

704
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,920
Animal Planet Emergency Vet was a game that was on there, you know, like the show on Animal

705
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Planet.

706
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,280
Bill Nye Science Lab on the Wii, no joke, Bill Nye the Science Guy finally gets a Wii

707
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,360
game.

708
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,120
That was like one of our dream games, wasn't it, I don't know, and then get this, You Don't

709
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,480
Know Jack on the Wii, finally, finally this game's coming back, thank God.

710
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,920
I know two other games that haven't been mentioned yet.

711
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,080
Oh, really?

712
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,040
They're also based off, like, TV shows, actually.

713
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Oh.

714
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,160
Hell's Kitchen is getting a game, which I think is kind of funny, and The Price is Right.

715
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,080
Hell yeah!

716
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
What for Wii?

717
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,000
Wii and DS.

718
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,080
I don't know, though, it probably's gonna suck.

719
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,400
You just can't play Plinko at home, it's not the same, you know what I mean?

720
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
It's just not the same.

721
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,880
I don't know.

722
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Alright.

723
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,640
They had a Price is Right game on Commodore 64, didn't they?

724
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Years ago?

725
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,160
They had some pretty old ones.

726
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,240
I was seeing some other stuff on here, too, and I'm sure a lot of people now are starting

727
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:04,680
to make up stuff to go along with this, but, I don't know, it's interesting.

728
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,520
I think a lot of the stuff you're going to see at E3, and shit, it's only a few more

729
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
weeks away, really.

730
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,960
I mean, E3, what, a month away?

731
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,520
Well, I'm very curious to see what the fallout from all of this is, what the response is

732
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
from Microsoft tomorrow.

733
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,600
Oh, it's going to be a lot of do not comment shit, that's all it's going to be.

734
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,880
I'm very curious to see Microsoft's comment tomorrow, besides, you know, the standard

735
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,880
anything you can do, I can do better.

736
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
It is very interesting.

737
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,720
It sounds like they do have a lot of stuff up their sleeves.

738
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,880
And they said they had a few aces still up their sleeves for stuff, so.

739
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,600
Well, A for Ace Avatar, I don't know.

740
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Alright.

741
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,320
And after Matt says in chat, Price is Right for the Wii, Itagaki better do it, so he get

742
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,080
the bouncy titties, because you know that's why people watch the Price is Right.

743
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Oh my God.

744
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Come on down!

745
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga.

746
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
They should totally.

747
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Too bad it's all grandmas.

748
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Totally.

749
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:59,000
Like we were saying back, you know, last week, how Itagaki would do, like, you know, how

750
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,160
I appear, he would do, like, a press event or whatever, you know, kicking over stuff,

751
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,160
you know, saying things on fire, that kind of thing.

752
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,560
That would apply to Price is Right, too.

753
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,760
I think that would be pretty awesome.

754
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
That would be.

755
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
We're making a Price is Right game, bitch.

756
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Alright.

757
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
Alright, so definitely lots more to come.

758
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,760
That story, of course, all still in development, was very new.

759
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,600
We'll see how this develops throughout the week.

760
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,160
Meanwhile, let's get into the news we were going to talk about anyway tonight, even though

761
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,020
that took like 20 minutes to cover, but that's pretty big.

762
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,360
Let's quickly run through some of the other week's news and let you guys comment.

763
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
Alright.

764
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:39,920
Christopher says, Microsoft's comment, fuck, you didn't just hear that.

765
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,080
Nintendo is suing Nyko over the Comma Wireless Nunchuk, which doesn't really make much sense

766
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,800
to me when I think about it, because, you know, people put out third party accessories

767
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,920
all the time.

768
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,240
I guess Nintendo is just really super anal about people putting out, you know, third

769
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,880
party remotes and nunchucks, because actually if you think about it, I remember Mad Cats

770
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,200
was putting out a third party remote that kind of looked like a dildo, but actually

771
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,000
that's never come out yet.

772
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,640
So I'm wondering if these people are just getting blocked by Nintendo for this stuff,

773
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,680
but either way, they are suing them because apparently it appropriates the novel shape,

774
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,120
design, overall appearance, and even the colored materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuk controller.

775
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,760
Except it's also wireless, but apparently it's similar enough, and people are thinking

776
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,800
hey, maybe Nintendo is making their own wireless nunchuck.

777
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,000
I doubt that, but, I don't know, it still sucks.

778
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,120
So if you're looking to buy a wireless nunchuck, do it now, before they're pulled from shelves.

779
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,060
Do you think this has any merit on Nintendo's part?

780
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,640
It's just weird because there's tons of third party controllers out there, why this one?

781
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,400
It's true that, you know, it has merit, but at the same time though, I thought that this

782
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,120
stuff has to be approved through Nintendo first, before they make these peripherals,

783
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,360
they have to approve it with Nintendo.

784
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,240
Because the same could be said with the Wii Zapper, there's a bunch of things that came

785
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,040
out before the Wii Zapper that were pretty much exactly the same as the Wii Zapper.

786
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,060
And some things, in fact, Nyko even made a better peripheral than the Wii Zapper for

787
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,060
gun games.

788
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,240
But I don't know, it sucks.

789
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,960
I don't know, because it's something that people want, so they're going to buy it.

790
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't think they're going to lose any nunchuck sales on this, maybe they will a little bit,

791
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,980
but they're really, I don't know, money hungry if that's the case.

792
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,840
But I guess at the same time, they also have to protect their patents and stuff, so maybe

793
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,140
that's why they're doing this.

794
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:43,280
But either way though, there should have been some sort of process where they have to get

795
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,040
approval from Nintendo to put out these products, or I don't know, usually that's the way it

796
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,160
works I thought.

797
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,280
All right, well we'll see what happens if they get the pants suit off of them, or what

798
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
will happen.

799
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,120
But you think Nintendo just want to put out a wireless thing of their own, is that what's

800
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
going on?

801
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
I don't know.

802
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,760
Jamie, what do you think of this whole lawsuit stuff?

803
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,080
I think it's just Nintendo trying to keep the market under their control.

804
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,200
Well, Nintendo did this this week, and it's not Nintendo as a company, but one person

805
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,920
at Nintendo, but when you hire a person like this as your marketing director, he's speaking

806
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,900
on behalf of your company, and this guy pissed me off this week, I don't know about you guys.

807
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,920
This was in Edge Magazine, and Nintendo of Europe marketing director, Laurent Fisher,

808
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,840
was talking about the whole, he got of course, as most Nintendo people have, got kind of

809
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,120
put on the spot lately while he was talking about WiiWare games.

810
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,000
Where is the extra storage?

811
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,240
What about all these people that are filling up their Wii consoles with all this stuff?

812
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,480
Where is the extra storage?

813
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,720
Well, according to Laurent Fisher, only geeks and otaku want the issue addressed.

814
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,280
Here's the actual quote from the magazine here.

815
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,720
You can read their little site online at next-gen.biz.

816
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,400
When a question about the limited Wii system memory was raised, Nintendo's Laurent Fisher

817
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,720
slipped into talking about how geeks and otaku were the only people who would want this issue

818
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
addressed.

819
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,520
Yeah, that would be their entire fan base.

820
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,120
Duh.

821
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,440
Then he went and tried to backtrack a little later.

822
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,440
He was talking to video gaming 24-7.

823
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,680
He didn't mean to offend anyone, and it's all a misunderstanding.

824
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
You know what?

825
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:35,120
I don't know how much more cut and dry that could be, or how that could be misconstrued

826
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,520
to mean anything else.

827
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,680
Geek and otaku, first of all, apart from being slightly synonymous, except with otaku having

828
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:49,280
a slightly bigger social stigma overseas, is still...

829
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
Your freaking marketing director?

830
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,000
You want to appeal to these people.

831
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,520
I know Nintendo is trying to get the broader audience and trying to get the moms and grandmoms

832
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,800
into it, but still, their core fan base is the nerdy gamer, sorry.

833
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
And here's the problem.

834
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,360
Every particular geek has spent lots of money on these virtual console downloads, downloading

835
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,360
the same shit I played years ago, when I could be playing them for free on the internet.

836
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,880
But no, I decided to support Nintendo.

837
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,280
I decided to download these games and actually pay the price for them so I could have the

838
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,560
official emulator and support the people behind it, and this is how we get thanked?

839
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,720
I downloaded ZSNES.

840
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
I know, that's what I'm saying.

841
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,520
I could have done that, and I could have never supported the whole virtual console thing.

842
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,320
I would have the space on my drive to do more WiiWare games, and I wouldn't have to worry

843
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,520
about any of this.

844
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,000
No.

845
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,400
But then, this is the thanks we get for supporting Nintendo.

846
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,200
You're a geek.

847
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,080
So you know what?

848
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,120
Fuck you.

849
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,440
I am not downloading anything else on virtual console.

850
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I don't give a shit.

851
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,920
They could put Guardian Legend out on it tomorrow.

852
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
I'm not getting it.

853
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,840
I will play it on NES emulators, thank you very much, and be happy.

854
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,400
I will not download any more WiiWare titles.

855
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:12,640
I will not support Nintendo's download service until A, this guy is let go or shifted into

856
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,720
another position where he's not speaking on behalf of the company, or B, Nintendo addresses

857
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
this issue.

858
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
That's it.

859
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,760
Personally, I'm not going to suffer because of one idiot, but I think that it would probably

860
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,640
be a bit more, I would have to say, well, first of all, they're not going to know that

861
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,080
you're doing this if you just do it and they're not going to listen to our podcast.

862
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
I know.

863
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,780
I'm hoping maybe some of the listeners will kind of wake up as well and maybe join me

864
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,860
in this little boycott.

865
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:50,360
I think that a movement, and I'm going to use that term, has no real power unless the

866
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,440
ones you're moving against know what you're doing.

867
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:02,320
So why not put together some type of organized effort to address it?

868
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,660
It's one thing to say we're going to do this on the show, but another thing to actually

869
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:12,720
send a letter to Nintendo, to the CEO US, to the ones in the UK.

870
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,340
So are you saying I should start some type of blog where I encourage people to send letters

871
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,340
and join me in this boycott?

872
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Why not?

873
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,340
All right.

874
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
I'll do it tomorrow.

875
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,340
Okay.

876
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
All right.

877
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
We're doing it.

878
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,340
We are?

879
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,340
We are.

880
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,340
We're doing it.

881
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,340
Okay.

882
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
And you're signing it.

883
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,340
Hey, I'm fine with it.

884
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,180
I haven't really been downloading anything from Nintendo's WiiWare service anyways.

885
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,660
My download service actually isn't working, but I did want posting once now.

886
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,340
That's the thing is I've been trying to support Nintendo and that's why you might just think,

887
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:44,180
Rob, get over it, but it's one of these things where like, dude, this is the marketing director.

888
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
This is what he's going to say.

889
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,500
Isn't that marketing director UK?

890
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
It doesn't matter.

891
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:56,140
But I'm saying, you know, we're going to have to, the letters have to go to him, to whoever

892
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:05,420
his boss is in Nintendo UK, to over here and probably even to the overall head officer.

893
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,020
You know, dark Tetsuya says, Oh, please, Rob, you'll download the guardian legend if they

894
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,020
put it out tomorrow.

895
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,020
No, I won't.

896
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,680
Rob can come over to my house and play it.

897
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
I can play.

898
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,220
Go download it on an emulator and I guess I'll be just fine.

899
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,060
Just fine.

900
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,060
So there you have it.

901
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,060
Let's see.

902
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,060
What does Game Guru say?

903
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,660
Nintendo will fix the issue for Animal Crossing at E3.

904
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,540
If they don't, I will join this boycott.

905
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,580
Game Guru, I actually think my boycott will be over by E3 because I think, like I said,

906
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:42,940
I will un-boycott when they address this issue finally and stop pretending it doesn't exist.

907
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:47,580
And if it doesn't get addressed, then it just justifies the boycott even more.

908
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:54,860
So it's still one thing has got to get enough people to participate when a shadow try says,

909
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,060
Oh, now you go back on it.

910
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,060
No, I'm not.

911
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,160
I said the boycott will be over when a, this guy gets let go or B, Nintendo addresses the

912
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,860
issue and it's widely anticipated and Nintendo will address the issue at E3 with some type

913
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,340
of storage device.

914
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,940
But I don't think they're going to come out at E3 and say, Hey, just for geeks, no tacos.

915
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,660
Well, that's so fucking lame anyways, because your average, you know, anybody that's using

916
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,820
the Wii console needs the storage space because they didn't think it through very well.

917
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,260
They were trying to cut costs to make this thing very, you know.

918
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,740
Why are you bragging that there's a hundred, I'm sorry, this isn't you, this isn't Nintendo.

919
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,580
Why are you bragging there's a hundred plus different games you can download on virtual

920
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,100
console when your stupid thing won't even hold it, you know, more than 20?

921
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:38,140
Well, one other thing though that I would like to say is that Nintendo does have a track

922
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,580
record for creating the demand for something.

923
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,120
And then when people are worked up enough about it, they'll release the product.

924
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,860
So I would not be at all surprised if they didn't have something like this already in

925
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,600
mind that they put out this massive amount of downloadable content, stuff that's going

926
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,460
to fill up all this space.

927
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,380
And then when people are like, what do we do, what do we do?

928
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,140
Nintendo comes to save the day with a storage unit, you know, something like that.

929
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,580
Hit stun says, somebody called you a geek and you're going to boycott over it.

930
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,580
Um, sorta.

931
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Yeah.

932
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,420
Because if I mentioned a derogatory fashion, yes, because it was meant in a derogatory

933
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,420
fashion.

934
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,740
And if we've been supporting the company for all this years and this is the thanks we get,

935
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,420
then I'm not going to support it anymore.

936
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,980
Well, that's, that's the issue.

937
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,500
Online plays for geeks and a tacos.

938
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
I don't know.

939
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Yeah.

940
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,220
Avatars are for non-friend codes are for geeks and tacos.

941
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,220
Geeks and tacos.

942
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,220
No.

943
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Oh, tacos.

944
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,660
If he said download things were for tacos, I would be, yeah.

945
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,660
Tacos are rad.

946
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,660
Okay.

947
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,300
Um, I'm going to, I'm going to give a GameStop gift certificate to anyone who comes over

948
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,260
here and brings us chicken, soft tacos.

949
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Nobody knows where we live.

950
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,260
Some people do.

951
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,260
I live.

952
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,260
All right.

953
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,980
Look, I'm, I'm done with my rant.

954
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,260
I'm sure we'll get emails on it.

955
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,660
Let's go on to the next story.

956
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh yeah.

957
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
We have that.

958
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Don't we?

959
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yes.

960
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,780
Um, for, uh, people who are going to be downloading this stuff who may or may not be participating,

961
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,880
but only in the UK, we have, um, five new games out in virtual console.

962
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,020
We have, um, Alex Kidd Miracle World, which is a good, good game.

963
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,900
Um, and that is actually going to be 500 Wii points.

964
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:30,660
There is, um, Last Ninja and Nebulas for Commodore 64.

965
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,620
And, um, both of those are 500 Wii points.

966
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,780
And then for Neo Geo, we have Ninja Combat and Fatal Fury 2.

967
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,760
And those are going to be 900 Wii points.

968
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,980
Guess what, Rob?

969
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:48,140
You can actually come over to my house and play Fatal Fury 2 on my Neo Geo.

970
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,140
I'll do that.

971
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,140
Do you want to?

972
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,140
Yeah.

973
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,140
Okay.

974
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,940
Cause I think those Neo Geo cartridges have more storage than a Nintendo Wii.

975
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,780
512 megabytes.

976
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,180
So yeah, there's the same amount of storage in one of those fucking carts than there is

977
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,180
in the Nintendo Wii.

978
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,180
Same amount.

979
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,940
I would say that, yeah, they're 512 a piece.

980
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,780
I'm sorry, but flash memory is not that expensive.

981
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,260
And I don't understand why they couldn't have added more to this.

982
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:18,980
I think seeing as the device will already read a USB thing and or, or it will copy to

983
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,260
your SD card.

984
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,740
I don't see they could do it with a freaking patch.

985
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,140
They could patch the system there to temporarily load things off your SD card into the flash

986
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,140
memory.

987
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:32,900
I don't know about piracy, you know, with their Wii people already pirate.

988
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
Yeah, exactly.

989
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,980
People already know how to do it.

990
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,020
It's not going to matter anymore.

991
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,180
So oh well.

992
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:48,620
In other news, unrelated to Nintendo, Famitsu Magazine, you know, they're definitely one

993
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,620
of the most popular gaming magazines in Japan.

994
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,820
And if you want to get your grubby little hands on it, a subscription, it's going to

995
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,580
cost you quite a bit of money.

996
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:05,700
However, NCSX is offering import subscriptions to Famitsu Magazine, ranging anywhere and

997
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:14,420
I hope you have the money for this anywhere from $480 a year to $2,860 a year $480 per

998
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:20,740
year for issue or 52 issues because is a weekly magazine considering they're being shipped

999
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,740
from Japan.

1000
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,740
That's actually not that bad.

1001
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,740
Exactly.

1002
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:31,820
Yeah, for media mail and UPS overnight shipping would be $2,860 because it's overnight shipping

1003
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,940
that priority mail only $626 so you can do the same thing through Amazon and have been

1004
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,940
able to for a long time because I could I had a for a little while subscription to the

1005
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,620
Doctor Who magazine nerd.

1006
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:48,220
So you can also geek otaku just about whatever Rob I said it big fat.

1007
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,140
So what about that but this is nothing new.

1008
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,740
I mean, they're just doing the same thing that you've been able to do for Amazon for

1009
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,740
ages and ages.

1010
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,660
So nothing wrong with a little competition.

1011
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,340
I can get prices down.

1012
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,340
I could go to Kinokuniya and buy them every week too.

1013
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:09,500
So all right, but but there is something you know overnighting it to your door.

1014
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,980
That is kind of neat.

1015
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:17,220
But yeah, I guess Amazon huh a week later and every so often Kinokuniya will clear them

1016
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,780
out, you know, a couple weeks after that for half price.

1017
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,340
Well, hopefully something something coming to your door soon will be Mega Man 9.

1018
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:31,980
If this is to be believed Capcom apparently is recently registered Mega Man 9 under Australia's

1019
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,480
version of the ESRB.

1020
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,340
That would be the Office of Film and Literature Classification the OFLC.

1021
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,720
Apparently the game is going to be multi platform.

1022
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,460
So that could be pretty interesting especially when you consider a couple weeks ago didn't

1023
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,340
Capcom say something about reviving one of their dead franchises or there was going to

1024
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,340
be a couple.

1025
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,340
Yeah.

1026
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,780
And Mega Man 9 would be the revival of a pretty dormant franchise.

1027
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,220
I mean if you take out Battle Network and you know X and all that other stuff we haven't

1028
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,380
seen a Mega Man game since the PS1.

1029
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,900
So that would certainly be a welcome surprise I think.

1030
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,780
I certainly would love to see a Mega Man 9.

1031
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:10,060
I hope it has the cheesy anime sequences that Mega Man 8 had.

1032
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,060
You know what I want to see?

1033
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,060
Huh?

1034
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:21,020
I want to see a redo of Mega Man 2 with the higher end graphics I think as long as it

1035
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,020
plays the same way.

1036
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,780
Well there was sort of that thing on GameCube the anniversary condition.

1037
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,420
Yeah but I want shiny.

1038
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,900
Here's what I would like to see the Mega Man otaku geek in me would like to see.

1039
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:37,260
I would like to see them kind of do that like what you're saying but have the first three

1040
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:43,200
Mega Man games all combined where you could go into the different stages like let's say

1041
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,940
you could go play in Bubble Man's stage and then go to Top Man's stage and then to Cuts

1042
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,180
Man's stage and you could kind of like all of them combined.

1043
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,380
We need a new Rocket Man the power battles.

1044
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,220
That would be kind of cool.

1045
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,220
That would be hot.

1046
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,620
AJ Mix calls it Mega Man 2 HD Remix.

1047
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,620
Why not?

1048
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,620
Put it on Xbox 360.

1049
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,620
Exactly.

1050
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,620
Why not?

1051
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,620
Sounds like fun.

1052
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,620
Alright.

1053
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:10,740
You know what we should download extra stuff on Xbox 360 and put that include that in our

1054
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,740
letter.

1055
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:17,620
I already download a lot on Xbox 360 there's really that's really nothing new so I have

1056
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,740
that thing set to automatically download all demos which was a pretty brilliant idea but

1057
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,780
Xbox can do that because the hard drives are huge they're 20 gigs.

1058
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,260
I've yet to film it.

1059
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,820
And if you need more space there is a 120 gig hard drive available.

1060
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,660
Exactly that 20 gigs has been more than enough.

1061
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,660
And if you're industrious.

1062
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,540
Especially especially after I deleted Final Fantasy 11.

1063
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,540
It's been more than enough space because I don't really watch movies on it but if I did

1064
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:45,100
I could go get that 120 or you know they have the you can put stuff on USB memory card da

1065
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,740
da da da da da da.

1066
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,860
Act Def calls it kind of like the Sonic 2 HD version some guys are doing.

1067
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,180
Well kind of.

1068
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,620
Alpha Cannongram says Sky Mega Man anniversary collection for GameCube sucks.

1069
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,620
Oh yeah I forgot there's a whole GameCube versus PS2 even though the GameCube had the

1070
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,820
remix music it screwed with the buttons and all that.

1071
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,100
All right fine whatever.

1072
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,500
You know what I meant.

1073
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
I'm still excited about Mega Man 9.

1074
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,100
Well that is actually pretty cool.

1075
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,100
You know.

1076
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:17,820
But for our people who like their video games turned into movies like me as long as they're

1077
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,780
not fucked up.

1078
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:26,900
There is some news about Onimusha and Clock Tower movies and actually the Clock Tower

1079
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,060
movie still has Christoph Ganz still attached to it.

1080
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,420
So that's pretty cool.

1081
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,780
That's cool because I like Silent Hill.

1082
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,220
I for one liked it.

1083
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:44,340
And that one's got a I'm trying well I think actually that and Onimusha are set to come

1084
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,340
out 2011.

1085
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,340
So.

1086
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,740
Actually no I take that back.

1087
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:54,300
Onimusha is going to be out I'm not Onimusha will be out in 2011 and Clock Tower will be

1088
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:00,780
out next year possibly but it better not suck.

1089
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,780
Go camp out now.

1090
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,780
You know what.

1091
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,780
You know what Rob.

1092
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,780
What.

1093
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,620
We need a Fatal Frame movie.

1094
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,900
I still want to see the Silent Hill 2 movie get made.

1095
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Yes I know.

1096
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,100
I thought they were making a Fatal Frame movie.

1097
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,100
Are they?

1098
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,100
I thought.

1099
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,100
I don't know.

1100
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,100
That'd be cool.

1101
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,100
We'll see.

1102
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,100
Me too.

1103
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:27,260
So we got a lot of stuff coming out this week in game releases in the U.S. on PC.

1104
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,260
Political Machines 2008.

1105
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:36,940
Yes you too can now take part of your own I don't know political election.

1106
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:45,220
Also this week we've got the Spore Creature Creator for PC if you want to you know have

1107
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,420
a little piece of spore to play until the actual game comes out.

1108
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,220
Although apparently if you know where to look you can already get it.

1109
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,220
That's the demo.

1110
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,420
And I hear it's quite good.

1111
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,420
That's the demo.

1112
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,420
Oh.

1113
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,420
Still.

1114
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,420
I hear it's quite good.

1115
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,420
Yes.

1116
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,520
I haven't played it myself but I hear it's good.

1117
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:06,900
Also this week Space Invaders Extreme on the PSP and DS definitely worth checking out.

1118
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,100
Finally.

1119
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:14,620
Imagine Rockstar on the DS not quite as cool as Imagine Babies but whatever.

1120
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,460
Imagine Babies is still in my backpack.

1121
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,260
Special in its own way.

1122
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,020
Wacky Races Crash and Dash.

1123
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,020
Yes.

1124
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,580
That's based off of that really old cartoon series.

1125
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,740
Does anyone still remember it?

1126
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,740
I don't know.

1127
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,740
No.

1128
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:33,900
Code Lyoko, Fall of Izana is coming on the DS.

1129
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,340
Secret Agent Clank on the PSP.

1130
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,100
Ubisoft's whoring yet another pets franchise.

1131
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,380
Pets Dogs Fashion.

1132
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,380
That's right.

1133
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,500
Dogs dressed up like things.

1134
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,940
Interesting.

1135
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,020
But not.

1136
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,900
Stop anthropomorphizing our animals.

1137
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Arkanoid on the DS.

1138
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
That's pretty cool.

1139
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,380
Tamagotchi Connection Corner 3.

1140
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:05,680
We've got the Rock Band Special Edition which is coming out next Sunday on the Wii.

1141
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,500
Also Guitar Hero On Tour will be coming out on the DS as well.

1142
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,940
And I believe that's it.

1143
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:20,180
Probably slow week for game releases actually.

1144
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,660
Not too much more upbeat over in Japan either.

1145
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,420
It's kind of a slow period for release dates in Japan but on the Xbox 360 on June 19th

1146
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:31,980
you can pick up Flat Out Ultimate Carnage if you want to get that because their releases

1147
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,940
tend to be on Fridays.

1148
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:39,460
Over on the Playstation 3, not a lot coming out this week.

1149
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,060
Stay tuned for next week.

1150
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:46,020
On the Nintendo Wii you can pick up Puyo Puyo which has now been reduced in price.

1151
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:50,700
You can also get Super Mario Stadium Family Baseball is coming out on the 19th as well.

1152
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,180
Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian comes out in Japan, a localized version there.

1153
00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:01,740
And Harukanaru Jiku no Kade 4 comes out from Koei on the 19th as well.

1154
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,060
Taking a look at the PS2 for those of you that still love that.

1155
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:11,040
Another version of Harukanaru Jiku no Kade comes out on the Playstation 2.

1156
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,140
So Love Drops and Odin Sphere get moved into the best meaning they get price drops.

1157
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:20,860
And Sora Yume also comes out on the Playstation 2.

1158
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:27,820
Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS we have Nippon Shuzan Renmei Kanshu Itsu

1159
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,500
Demosoroban DS comes out.

1160
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Also another version of Puyo Puyo.

1161
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,980
The pronunciation is getting a lot better Rob.

1162
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,420
Since I've been doing this for a long time now it's getting slowly better.

1163
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,580
Just remember everything is either A, I, U, A, O.

1164
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,300
Okay, I'm trying.

1165
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,020
Spectral Force Genesis comes out on the Nintendo DS.

1166
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,140
And Watashi no Pony comes out.

1167
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,140
My Pony.

1168
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,860
Yes, it's like My Pony.

1169
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,380
It's not My Little Pony.

1170
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,380
Is this My Pony?

1171
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,040
It's just My Pony.

1172
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,580
But it is definitely a pony game for the DS.

1173
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,580
There's no mistake.

1174
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,900
There's a big old pony right there on the cover.

1175
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,500
So something to look for.

1176
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,940
And My Health Coach Weight Management comes to all Asian regions this week as well on

1177
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,940
the Nintendo DS.

1178
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,820
Although I'm thinking I don't know a lot of Husky Asians.

1179
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,060
I'm thinking that's a game they need to release over here a little quicker.

1180
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,180
I think it is out over here though.

1181
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,840
On the Sony PSP God of War Chains of Olympus comes out in Chinese.

1182
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,860
It's localized for Chinese so that's coming out this week.

1183
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,660
That's not Japan but you know Asia in general.

1184
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,840
Comes out over there.

1185
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,060
Also coming out on the Sony PSP Secret Agent Clank.

1186
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,980
Super Robot Tyson a portable.

1187
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:39,980
Sweet.

1188
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:43,820
There aren't enough Super Robot Wars.

1189
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,020
That's really it.

1190
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,580
Also the headset and remote come out for the PSP this week in Japan.

1191
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,660
There you have it.

1192
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,940
I want the one of those that has the Avas in it.

1193
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:55,940
The Robot Tyson.

1194
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,140
I think it was one of the Saturn ones.

1195
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,140
Very cool.

1196
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,140
Is it my turn?

1197
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,140
It is your turn.

1198
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,140
It's in the UK.

1199
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,140
Lots of them.

1200
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,140
Well a few of them.

1201
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,140
But on lots of systems.

1202
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,540
We have Alone in the Dark for Wii, PS2, PC and Xbox 360.

1203
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,660
Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 on PSP.

1204
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,660
About Time.

1205
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,380
Gauntlet on DS.

1206
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,940
I like Gauntlet.

1207
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:26,040
The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian on PSP, Xbox 360, DS, PS2, Wii PC, PS3 and Top

1208
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,020
Spin on Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360.

1209
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,020
Not to be confused with that really cool car show Top Gear.

1210
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,580
I'm looking at Justin TV chat right now which I don't usually watch during the show but

1211
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,900
I know we have some people who can only watch on Justin TV because for whatever reason the

1212
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,780
other ways to listen to this are banned.

1213
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,220
Ikuma JP who actually lives in Japan pays me a compliment and says I understand Skye's

1214
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,460
Japanese now.

1215
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,900
That is quite the compliment actually.

1216
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
I never had a lesson.

1217
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:57,380
I was just saying it really is I guess with practice you know and I have noticed you picking

1218
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,380
up a little vocabulary.

1219
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,380
A little.

1220
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,380
A little.

1221
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,380
A little.

1222
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,380
Rob's picking up stuff.

1223
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,540
Pretty soon I'm going to start answering my phone.

1224
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,540
Moshi Moshi.

1225
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,540
Alright.

1226
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,060
Also, Ikuma JP brings up that whole difference.

1227
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,060
Is Mega Man the same thing as Rock Man?

1228
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,060
Yes.

1229
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,700
Rock Man is what it is in Japan and Europe.

1230
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,980
I don't know why they called it Mega Man here.

1231
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,740
I'm thinking that maybe they thought if they called the game Rock Man people would have

1232
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,900
thought it was like a rock band or rock music.

1233
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,580
Well, there was the girl assistant was Roll.

1234
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,580
I know.

1235
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,580
Rock and roll.

1236
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,580
I know.

1237
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,580
It makes perfect sense.

1238
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,420
Maybe is it because like Guts Man was kind of a rock character and they didn't want people

1239
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,020
to think he was a bad guy.

1240
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,020
I don't know.

1241
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,020
I don't know.

1242
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,180
Because people don't get it.

1243
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,180
It's weird.

1244
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,300
They did have a lot of those changes back in the day.

1245
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,300
Random.

1246
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,580
And the really ugly cover that Mega Man 2 had.

1247
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,580
Oh my God.

1248
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,900
This is when Capcom was like let's Americanize all of the art.

1249
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,780
That was a pretty awesome cover.

1250
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:59,420
The only I think good one that was done was one of the Metal Gear ones that looked like

1251
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,780
it had Michael Bayne on it.

1252
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,700
I was like dude Terminator.

1253
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,380
Akuma, you got to check that out if you've never seen it.

1254
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,620
Go to Google art and search for the Mega Man 2 box art because it's pretty epic.

1255
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,420
In fact, if you live overseas and you've never seen it, it's pretty hilarious.

1256
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,660
Prepare to weep.

1257
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,780
All right.

1258
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,780
It's hideous.

1259
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,780
All right.

1260
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,780
Let's get back to some gaming news.

1261
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,780
Sorry, Loki.

1262
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,780
All right.

1263
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,340
Well, with E3 right around the corner, of course, it's about this time of the year where

1264
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:30,100
people start making their lists of games that have been announced to be discussed during

1265
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,100
E3.

1266
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:37,140
IGN, of course, is one of those websites that's doing that and some interesting things have

1267
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,180
come out of that.

1268
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:42,660
One thing that's popped up, there are two untitled Capcom projects that weren't shown

1269
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,500
off at the recent Captivate event.

1270
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,340
And they're thinking Dead Rising 2 perhaps.

1271
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,700
Oh, they're so close.

1272
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,700
They're so close.

1273
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Warmer.

1274
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,700
Getting warmer.

1275
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,700
You're so close.

1276
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,700
You're warm.

1277
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,420
I don't know what the other one is, but we know what one of them is.

1278
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,740
Bionic Commando Rearmed.

1279
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:08,460
But I guess considering that E3 is coming out mid-July, it'd probably be out before

1280
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,180
then.

1281
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:16,300
And Halo Wars was there, but Alan Wake was not.

1282
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,380
And the list is still very incomplete right now.

1283
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:23,660
So there's, you know, no Atari, Codemasters, Crave, Disney, Eidos, Konami, LucasArts,

1284
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:31,020
MTV, Nintendo, Sega, Sony Online, Square Enix, Take Two, Tecmo, THQ, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers

1285
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,380
Interactive.

1286
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:36,660
So that's a big gap right there.

1287
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,220
A big list.

1288
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:44,700
But I'm sorry, I'm reading in chat about the whole Rockman versus Mega Man thing, and GameGuru

1289
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,880
is saying Rocks is slang for crack.

1290
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,500
So maybe that's why they didn't want to release it here, because people would have thought

1291
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,500
it was Crack Man.

1292
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,700
So I don't know, if you release a game called Crack Man, I think it might actually sell

1293
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,420
pretty well.

1294
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:00,860
And then Dark Sakura, our very own, followed that up in chat, saying also Rocks would be

1295
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,860
slang for nads.

1296
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,420
Thank you for pointing that out.

1297
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:10,660
But it was pointed out by Shauron that everything is slang for either some kind of drug or something

1298
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,340
to do with sex, and I said that everyone likes sex and drugs.

1299
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,340
It's true.

1300
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,340
It can be.

1301
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,340
It's true.

1302
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,580
But not everybody, for real.

1303
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,060
Some people.

1304
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:23,860
Did you know that Pac Man overseas is called Puck Man?

1305
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,860
Yes, I did.

1306
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,860
P-U-C-K Man.

1307
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,940
And you know why they didn't release that here?

1308
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,460
Because they were afraid that people were going to take their magic markers and color

1309
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:36,100
over the P with an F. I swear to God, I read it on Wikipedia, therefore it's true.

1310
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,100
Rob.

1311
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,100
What?

1312
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,100
Rob.

1313
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,100
Rob.

1314
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,100
Rob.

1315
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,100
Rob.

1316
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,100
What?

1317
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,100
Next story.

1318
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,100
All right.

1319
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,100
Sure, we can do that.

1320
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,100
And I don't know, Jamie, this might be of interest to you.

1321
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,980
Have you ever wanted to have a life-size solid snake statue?

1322
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,380
Uh, hey?

1323
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,380
Why not?

1324
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,260
You know, shit, we ought to get one of these for the studio.

1325
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,980
That would be kind of rad, actually.

1326
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,980
It's a fucking auction.

1327
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,980
All right.

1328
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,980
Well, here's the thing.

1329
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:08,060
What Sam's Club is doing, Sam's Club is actually selling a life-size statue of the old snake,

1330
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,860
and it's being sold starting this upcoming week.

1331
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:14,760
Unfortunately, it's not something you can actually go into the store and buy.

1332
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,460
It's being auctioned.

1333
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,940
And it's actually in a Walmart blog that originally announced this called Checkout.

1334
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,540
I had no idea that there were blogs about Walmart.

1335
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:27,000
You learn new things every day.

1336
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,700
You can find it on auctions.samsclub.com, and if you search for Metal Gear Solid, you

1337
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:37,620
can find the stand-up, which I would love to have one of here in studio, but somehow

1338
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,620
I don't think that's going to happen.

1339
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,620
In fact, I want to see...

1340
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,740
I'm going to guess that's probably going to go for a lot of money.

1341
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,580
There's only one thing I've ever won on...

1342
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,700
Is the money going to charity or anything?

1343
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,920
I'm sure it will be.

1344
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,180
There's only one thing I've ever won from a charity auction, and it's a fully...

1345
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,660
I tried to search for it, and it says sold out.

1346
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,580
So what's up with that?

1347
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,100
Maybe it doesn't start until Monday or something.

1348
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,100
Yeah.

1349
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,700
I've won one thing off of a charity auction for gaming-related stuff.

1350
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,700
Really?

1351
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,700
True Crime New York City.

1352
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,460
I have a poster signed by the entire cast.

1353
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,460
Huh.

1354
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,860
It's at work, though, framed.

1355
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,980
I didn't even know that was something you were really a fan of.

1356
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:20,000
True Crime New York City, before the game actually came out and sucked, looked like

1357
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,620
a pretty cool Grand Theft Auto game, and I like True Crime L.A., and that was kind of

1358
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:24,620
fun.

1359
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,980
So, I don't know.

1360
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,300
I bought it, and it was cool.

1361
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,660
It was the poster that they had, the little teaser poster, before they announced that

1362
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,660
it was New York City.

1363
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,500
You were supposed to guess, you know, what city it was.

1364
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Right, right.

1365
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Yeah.

1366
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,420
Apparently, this auction is not up until next week, but I'll tell you what.

1367
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,620
If it's a reasonable price, I might go put a bid on it.

1368
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,620
We'll see.

1369
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,980
But I'll probably get outbid pretty quick.

1370
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,980
I think it'll be fun.

1371
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,500
Wouldn't you like to have Solid Snake sitting in the corner of the studio?

1372
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,260
Maybe Young Hot Snake.

1373
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,260
Not Old Man Snake.

1374
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,260
All right.

1375
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,260
Fine.

1376
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,260
Then I won't bid on it.

1377
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,980
If you're not going to appreciate the things I do for you...

1378
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,460
I'm not saying I wouldn't mind it, but now that it was, you know, if he had the camo

1379
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,460
mask, that'd be awesome.

1380
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,460
We'll figure something out.

1381
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,580
I could put the Dr. Dick hat on him, the little orange hat here.

1382
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:12,100
I don't even know if Justin TVers can see it because it's kind of blurry, but we could

1383
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,540
give that to Solid Snake.

1384
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,540
No.

1385
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,540
All right.

1386
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,540
Fine.

1387
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:22,260
Well, there's something else that's sort of, uh, noteworthy as, um, rumors going around

1388
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:26,420
that Sony was going to make any PS3 controller that would break into two parts so that you

1389
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:30,060
could use, uh, use it, I guess, like a Wiimote.

1390
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:35,420
Um, there was actually no real clear information given about it, but what it actually turns

1391
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:42,740
out to be, um, like I said, rumor, is that it was supposed to be a controller that has

1392
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,180
parts that will attach to it.

1393
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:50,820
I guess, you know how the, um, 360s got the keyboard attachment on the controller and

1394
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,660
the Mina mic and different stuff.

1395
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,220
The little mini board.

1396
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,220
Yeah.

1397
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,220
Yeah.

1398
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,900
But this is supposed to be just sort of like stuff that will merge with the controller

1399
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,860
and Sony hasn't confirmed or denied too much about it.

1400
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:08,540
It's like Voltron in controller form.

1401
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,100
Do not associate Voltron with anything remotely Sony.

1402
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,100
I'm sorry.

1403
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,100
By the way.

1404
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,100
Hail Jamie.

1405
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,100
By the way, Rod.

1406
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,100
What?

1407
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,100
I thought that you might think this is funny.

1408
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,300
I downloaded the entire, um, virtual, uh, vehicle Voltron series.

1409
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,300
Nice.

1410
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,300
Cause it was awesome.

1411
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,300
All right.

1412
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,300
All right.

1413
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:33,620
Um, anyways, we've got some, uh, cool stuff coming out, uh, available for download content

1414
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,820
this week for Rockband and Guitar Hero 3.

1415
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:41,300
Uh, coming to Rockband, we've got Avenged Sevenfold, Offspring, and Crooked X.

1416
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:46,460
Um, there's going to be a couple of songs here, Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, which

1417
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:52,340
is going to be 160 Microsoft points or $2, uh, Critical Acclaim by Avenged Sevenfold

1418
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:59,300
as well for 160 Microsoft points, also $2, and, uh, Hammerhead, um, by the Offspring

1419
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:06,780
for 160 Microsoft points, also $2, and finally, uh, Rock and Roll Dream by Crooked X for 80

1420
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,780
Microsoft points or a dollar.

1421
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,420
So that's, uh, what you're getting for Rockband.

1422
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:19,640
Uh, coming to Guitar Hero 3, Coldplay, and new singles and a couple more tracks coming

1423
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,360
as well, um, including, there's going to be the Coldplay Track Pack.

1424
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:29,940
It will contain Violet Hill, um, which is the first single from their, uh, Viva La Vida

1425
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:37,340
album, uh, Yellow, and God Put a Smile on Your Face from the album A Rush of Blood to

1426
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,340
the Head.

1427
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,740
Somehow, I just don't think you could jam to The Scientist, so, you know, they kind

1428
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,620
of had to put these other songs on there.

1429
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:44,620
Yeah.

1430
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,620
At least have some guitar in them.

1431
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:52,100
That's going to bring you 500 Microsoft points, um, or $6.25 via the PlayStation Network.

1432
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,100
Alright.

1433
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,780
I might actually check, I like Coldplay.

1434
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,940
They're pretty cool.

1435
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:00,620
I don't know, I don't think of myself as rocking out to them on Guitar Hero, but that could

1436
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,620
be interesting.

1437
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:05,140
Coldplay's got some pretty guitar-heavy stuff.

1438
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:10,620
I guess that's true, but maybe I think because my favorite Coldplay stuff is their more slowed-down

1439
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:14,420
stuff, like The Scientist, Fix You, I like all those really, like, slow, whiny songs.

1440
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,700
You know, that's what I like.

1441
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,700
Well, my favorite one they did is Talk.

1442
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,700
Alright.

1443
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,700
Oh, that was a good song.

1444
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,700
It was a really good song.

1445
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,700
It was my favorite one by them.

1446
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,700
Alright.

1447
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,700
Hey, why isn't that in Guitar Hero?

1448
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,700
That could be in Guitar Hero.

1449
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,700
It should be.

1450
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,700
Alright.

1451
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,660
Well, maybe, maybe in Coldplay Pack 2.

1452
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,660
Alright.

1453
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,900
Um, Rock Band 2 is going to be featuring this band.

1454
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,020
I have never heard of this band in my entire life.

1455
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,220
Their name is Turbo, Turbo Negro?

1456
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,260
Is that the name of them?

1457
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,260
I don't even know.

1458
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,500
This band, apparently, is going to be, I guess, is one of those cool, I mean, look at this

1459
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,500
guy.

1460
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:51,460
He's wearing, like, a ginormous fur, like, train, like a bride, like a bride would wear.

1461
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,380
You know what impression I'm getting of them, Rob?

1462
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,380
What?

1463
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,380
Is, um.

1464
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,380
The Village People.

1465
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,380
The Village People, right.

1466
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,380
You've got a sailor, and you've got, like, the bride.

1467
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,380
I have never.

1468
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,380
You have a pimp.

1469
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:03,340
I have never heard of, God, I feel old.

1470
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,140
I seriously have never heard of this band.

1471
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,140
Like, I'm so out of touch with you.

1472
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,140
Rob, don't feel bad.

1473
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,140
Neither have I.

1474
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,140
Alright, good.

1475
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,140
However, I see bad religion, so.

1476
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,860
Well, hold on, I'll get to that for a minute.

1477
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,860
Sorry.

1478
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:13,860
Alright.

1479
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:18,140
Here's the thing is that when Age of Conan, you know, the big MMO, apparently, they put

1480
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:21,960
out a press release here saying that, you know, because this band, I guess, is going

1481
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,340
to be doing the Age of Conan soundtrack.

1482
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,340
Well, guess what?

1483
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:31,060
They're also going to be in Rock Band 2, and bad religion is also, supposedly, supposed

1484
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,180
to be in the Rock Band sequel, even though Jamie gave that away, and I'm just kidding.

1485
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,180
Sorry.

1486
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,100
But it was in, it was, it was thanks to Twitter.

1487
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,540
The guitarist and songwriter from bad religion, Brett Gurewitz, said in his Twitter, he posted

1488
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:48,800
this twit, seven meetings and four executive decisions later, back at Sound City, putting

1489
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,220
the finishing touches on Sorrow for Rock Band 2.

1490
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,100
I'm surprised he was able to post that with Twitter being down as much as he can.

1491
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,100
Are they Nordic Death Metal?

1492
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,100
Are they?

1493
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,740
They'd better be Nordic Death Metal.

1494
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,740
That'd be awesome.

1495
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,740
They are from Oslo, Norway.

1496
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,740
Woohoo!

1497
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,340
Also, let me see if I can find them on YouTube.

1498
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,480
What's the song that's supposed to be in there?

1499
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,620
It's Death, they're Death Punk rockers.

1500
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,620
Sweet!

1501
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,260
I'll try to find a clip.

1502
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:16,100
And I totally agree with Acts Deaf, because bad religion's fucking awesome.

1503
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,540
They did, like, one of my favorite songs ever is by bad religion.

1504
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,220
Okay, here's a song called All of My Friends Are Dead.

1505
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:34,220
All of my friends are dead, got kicked in the head, all my friends are dead, all my

1506
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,220
friends are dead.

1507
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,220
I'm gonna download this right now.

1508
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,220
Jamie approves.

1509
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,220
I'm downloading it.

1510
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,220
Alright, there you go.

1511
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:42,340
But bad religion does, did I Love My Computer?

1512
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:46,660
That would work well with, like, a Grand Theft Auto IV video that I could possibly film.

1513
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:53,500
Because we like playing this game during lunch where we put friendly fire off and then we

1514
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,060
fire rockets at each other so we get rocket jumped.

1515
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,500
It's kind of fun.

1516
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,380
Xenocore says it's Nordic Punk, not Death Metal.

1517
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,780
Here's that song by bad religion, by the way, in case you were wondering.

1518
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:18,020
Now, thankfully, I have heard of bad religion.

1519
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,380
Did they have an album called Apocalypse Dudes?

1520
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,180
That's great.

1521
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,900
By the way, Dragon Force supposedly has a new album out in August, so keep an eye out

1522
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,900
for that.

1523
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,900
Alright, there you go.

1524
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:36,540
That's a rock band update, or the segment where the old hosts of OLR learn about new

1525
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,940
bands that kids are into.

1526
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,940
I just downloaded it.

1527
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:39,940
Alright, cool.

1528
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,940
That song that you played.

1529
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,940
Alright.

1530
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,820
And I Love My Computer is great, so shut up.

1531
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,820
So anyway.

1532
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,020
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1533
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,860
You downloaded that on your iPhone, didn't you?

1534
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,860
Just now.

1535
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,060
I have to ask, what did you think about the iPhone announcements on Monday, about the

1536
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,580
new sleeker, cheaper one?

1537
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:56,260
I don't care.

1538
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:04,020
I don't, I didn't want a GPS, and I already have an 8 gigabyte iPhone, and I can just

1539
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,260
update my OS on it, so I don't care.

1540
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,260
I'm gonna get one.

1541
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,260
I want one.

1542
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:13,020
I mean, I already wanted an iPhone, and that just kinda upped the ante a little bit.

1543
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,620
Here's the, and then, ah, I have to ask, kids.

1544
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:18,620
Loki, what did you think of the iPhone announcements that happened on Monday?

1545
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:22,620
I didn't really care, because it said, well, the slim thing, it's slim around the edges,

1546
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,660
but it's actually thicker.

1547
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,920
And apparently, it's gonna have that new finish on the outside, either white or black, which

1548
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,840
is supposed to be really easy to scratch, instead of, you know, how they already had

1549
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,520
it perfect, where you didn't, you know, it wouldn't scratch that easy.

1550
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,020
And also, there's supposed to be a bunch of hidden fees.

1551
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,020
Awesome!

1552
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,720
Sounds like a phone for me.

1553
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,140
Really expensive, and filled with fees.

1554
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,340
See, that was the, that was the other thing, is that if they're gonna be cutting costs

1555
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,660
in one way, they're gonna try to get it from you another way.

1556
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,500
It's, they upped the price of the plan, is what they did, or something like that.

1557
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:59,780
So I'm sitting here with my, you know, I paid $400 for my iPhone, sure, but this thing has

1558
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:05,940
fucking lasted me, and it's fallen from my pocket, and landed on the floor, and lived.

1559
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,980
Although it's been in its nice, sturdy case, I got for it, too.

1560
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:14,380
And it enables me to listen to bullshit at work, because I can't watch it, but I put

1561
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,740
my thing over it and listened to episodes of Penn & Teller's Bullshit.

1562
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:21,820
And so I kept up with American Idol, and hi, David Cook won!

1563
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:27,100
Alright, uh, Joshie16 comments on the last story, saying, you know Skye, cool kids listen

1564
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,300
to Ashlee Simpson, so you should, too.

1565
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:33,100
Huh, now look, I'm not that old, I know no one listens to Ashlee Simpson, okay?

1566
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,700
I'll tell you what was cool with her.

1567
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,700
What?

1568
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,700
Her interview on the Charlotte Church show.

1569
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,260
I've gotten to be where I like that show.

1570
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:43,340
I still can't get over that Charlotte Church had like a hip talk show overseas.

1571
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,780
It's funny!

1572
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,820
I know, she's fucking Charlotte Church!

1573
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,820
But she's hilarious!

1574
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,260
She's the 11 year old girl that sang wah wah wah wah wah wah wah!

1575
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,660
She's freaking hilarious, no you should watch the, okay, Rob Rob Rob, watch the, go on YouTube

1576
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,140
later and watch the interview.

1577
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,800
I've seen, I've seen clips of the Charlotte Church show.

1578
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,780
Did you watch the interview with John Barrowman?

1579
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,780
No.

1580
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:03,780
Watch that!

1581
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,780
Okay, I will.

1582
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,700
It is seriously, it's seriously, you know, a boy and his hag.

1583
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:12,360
I mean that's, that's the whole conversation.

1584
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,180
The whole, that's their whole conversation.

1585
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,180
Okay.

1586
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,180
It's the best.

1587
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,580
Is that show still, are they still producing it overnight?

1588
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:21,980
No, she went on, she put it on hiatus after she had her baby, but was talking about bringing

1589
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:22,980
it back up.

1590
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:23,980
Huh.

1591
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,020
Because apparently she had a blast doing it.

1592
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,020
And um.

1593
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,020
But I just, I can't get over that.

1594
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,020
She had, what's your name, who did Big Brother?

1595
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,020
That little sweet 11 year old girl singing opera.

1596
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,020
Big Brother UK as well.

1597
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,020
All right.

1598
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,020
What was your name?

1599
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,020
Davina?

1600
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,020
Um.

1601
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,020
Yeah, the host, Davina or whatever it is.

1602
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,020
Yeah.

1603
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,020
She was on there.

1604
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,020
That was a really good interview too.

1605
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,940
But, and the Ashley Simpson one was great, but the Gwen Stefani one was great.

1606
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:42,940
All right.

1607
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,960
And she wanted to get, um, I have to say this.

1608
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,940
I was reading an interview where she wanted to get Paris Hilton on the show so she could

1609
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:49,940
make fun of her.

1610
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,940
All right.

1611
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,340
So, oh, that'd be funny.

1612
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,340
We've gone, let's see.

1613
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,340
What have we talked about tonight?

1614
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:59,460
We talked about D and D. We talked about international TV.

1615
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:03,460
You know something is wrong with OLR when we're talking about Charlotte Church's life.

1616
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,460
But her show's funny.

1617
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,460
All right.

1618
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:06,460
Talk about video games, Jamie.

1619
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,460
Uh-uh.

1620
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,460
Yes.

1621
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,460
The agency.

1622
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,460
Yes.

1623
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,460
There we go.

1624
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,460
Warmer.

1625
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:16,420
It is not going to have the thing, the word that I hate that I will not use.

1626
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:21,120
It is not going to have the arbitrary transactions that occur within the game that some people

1627
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,100
have used the term micro as a prefix to.

1628
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,100
How's that?

1629
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,100
Micro machines.

1630
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,540
Shut up.

1631
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:35,260
They are not going to be using an arbitrary transition system within the agency.

1632
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:39,840
They are actually going to have an in game currency that you will use like, um, a lot

1633
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,700
of MMOs have, you know, in an auction house.

1634
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:46,640
Oh, like a microtransaction.

1635
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:53,160
You will not be using actual currency to purchase your money in game.

1636
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:58,680
You will be using the in game currency that you use, much like buying your weapons in

1637
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:05,580
Metal Gear Solid 4, which is not an arbitrary transaction because it's no money out of your

1638
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,580
pocket.

1639
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,580
The micro machine man here, aircraft carrier there, he can't have that, he can't have this.

1640
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,580
He died.

1641
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,580
The new micro machine aircraft carrier playset.

1642
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,780
The dramatically detailed, terrifically trimmed replica of the real thing that holds 25 micro

1643
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:16,140
machines with fabulous, fantastic features, two totally terrific elevators, real working

1644
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,380
hoist runway and two cargo arms.

1645
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,940
The new micro machine aircraft carrier playset from Galoob.

1646
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,420
Remember, if it doesn't say micro machines, it's not the real thing.

1647
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:27,100
It's because, you know, he figured out that, you know, in your life you can only say so

1648
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:33,180
many words before you die and well, you know, he just blew through those really quick.

1649
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,180
You are horrible.

1650
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,560
You know what though?

1651
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:40,460
He was actually, I very, very much like him though because he was also Blur in Transformers

1652
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,460
the movie.

1653
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,460
He was also the Scatman.

1654
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,460
Wasn't that the same guy?

1655
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,460
No.

1656
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,460
No.

1657
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,460
Oh.

1658
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,460
I thought it was the same guy.

1659
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,460
No.

1660
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,660
I always thought Scatman and the micro machines guy were the same fucking guy.

1661
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:56,060
However, Scatman Cruthers was Hong Kong Phooey.

1662
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,060
Well they did both die.

1663
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,060
I know.

1664
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,060
That's sad.

1665
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,060
It is sad.

1666
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,060
Maybe Loki's on to something.

1667
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,060
As I was saying.

1668
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,060
Alright, sorry.

1669
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:08,260
We're screwed too then.

1670
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:15,420
The live gamer system is going to be used basically, you know, to set up like it is

1671
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:21,100
in EverQuest 2 where they use a golden game as a transaction but they said that they were

1672
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:29,460
planning on using an, I quote, alternate mechanics to use outside of in-game play for, like,

1673
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:34,300
I guess for purchasing things that go along with it but not necessarily as an integral

1674
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,300
part of the game play.

1675
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:40,180
Like if you're going to call you on your cell phone and shit too in this game, like to tell

1676
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:47,020
you, hey, Bub's, you know, been kidnapped, do you want to, you know, do you want to pay

1677
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,020
the ransom?

1678
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,020
No.

1679
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,460
And you're like, fucking stop calling me at work.

1680
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,700
I'm not playing you anymore.

1681
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,140
I don't know.

1682
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,140
Ah, technology.

1683
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,140
God, I love it.

1684
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,140
It's...

1685
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,140
It's...

1686
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,140
Speaking of technology though.

1687
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,140
Whatever.

1688
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,140
Not you.

1689
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,140
Not you.

1690
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,140
Rob.

1691
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,140
Um...

1692
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,140
What?

1693
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:14,500
No, Rob just looks over here and he has this amused expression and I'm like, whatever.

1694
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,500
Cause I'm funny.

1695
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:20,980
You are a fun guy like a fungus, ho ho ho ho.

1696
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:21,980
Next story.

1697
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,980
Anyways.

1698
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:28,860
So speaking of technology, Capcom is offering fans of the Street Fighter series to get their

1699
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,220
face into the game.

1700
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:38,940
And according to Capcom's Unity blog, they posted a call for fans to submit their story

1701
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,760
and why they should be in Street Fighter IV.

1702
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,700
You can send them anything from a new belly dancing telegram to, you know, something a

1703
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:47,700
little bit more elaborate.

1704
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,620
Just, you have to send it by June 18th.

1705
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,620
And um...

1706
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,620
Better get started.

1707
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:54,620
Yes.

1708
01:21:54,620 --> 01:22:03,740
You email your submissions to contest at capcom dot com and along with your name, phone number,

1709
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,020
age and email address.

1710
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,060
Loki, are you going to get your face in Street Fighter IV?

1711
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,060
I don't really care.

1712
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,060
I think you should.

1713
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,060
No.

1714
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,460
Will someone else send in Loki's face?

1715
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,460
Say it's theirs?

1716
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,140
That's what I'd like to see happen.

1717
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,540
Whenever these companies have these contests for get your face in the game, I want to see

1718
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:23,420
people just send in Loki's picture.

1719
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:28,780
I know which picture they'll send, and that's not going to work.

1720
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,020
I don't think so.

1721
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,740
I will sue them.

1722
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,300
Here's another game I'd like to see Loki in.

1723
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,220
It's Rose and Camellia.

1724
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,460
Have you ever heard of this game?

1725
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,540
Yes, it's the Slap-A-Woman game.

1726
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,540
I don't know if you've seen this.

1727
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:47,920
It's not domestic violence or any of that, you know, stuff that's not cool.

1728
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:54,580
This is that old, like, you know, ladies in big, floofy dresses taking their white gloves

1729
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,740
off and slapping the other woman in a dramatic soap opera fashion.

1730
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:00,460
You might have remembered this game from a couple months ago.

1731
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:01,460
There was a Flash game.

1732
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,460
Well, guess what?

1733
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:06,060
They also have it on the DS via homebrew, too.

1734
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,060
That's awesome.

1735
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:11,340
There is a brand new sequel to Rose and Camellia.

1736
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,540
It's Rose and Camellia 2.

1737
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,020
All new women to slap, all new stages.

1738
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,420
It's just all the things you loved about the first game, but more.

1739
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:22,500
By the way, I have to retract my statement.

1740
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,140
John Maschida Jr. isn't dead.

1741
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:28,260
Oh, the guy who did the microtransactions.

1742
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,940
So you must have thought he was Skep Man John, too, subconsciously.

1743
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,940
No, Skep McRothers.

1744
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:32,940
Whatever.

1745
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:35,400
There's someone else that, whatever.

1746
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,980
That's right.

1747
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,820
We were dead.

1748
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,820
That's okay.

1749
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:40,820
Sauron is great.

1750
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:43,140
People report that celebrities are dead all the time.

1751
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,540
Anyhow, here's the thing though.

1752
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,260
You cannot just get the sequel that easy.

1753
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:56,100
You have to actually beat the original Rose and Camellia to get the sequel.

1754
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,880
But I don't think the first game was that hard, from what I remember.

1755
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,380
But it's there.

1756
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,560
All right.

1757
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,560
Let's get to it.

1758
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,420
Boys, part A has ran really long tonight, thanks to our last minute news.

1759
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,420
That's all right.

1760
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:11,060
We've talked about a lot of stuff, but we have to take a minute to respect our elders

1761
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:16,420
a little bit and take a trip down the halls of gaming infamy in a little segment we call

1762
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,460
the Classic Game of the Week.

1763
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:23,220
Our very own Dark Sakura takes a look at the archives of games and finds something that

1764
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,660
you all should be playing right now.

1765
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,100
Dark Sakura, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

1766
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:31,140
I went for obscure, as in obscure system.

1767
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,660
It's a game that came out on the 32X.

1768
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,220
Haven't done 32X games before?

1769
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,980
I don't think we've had a 32X game yet.

1770
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,020
I think I might have done, um, I haven't done Space Harrier, have I?

1771
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:43,020
Not to my knowledge.

1772
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,380
But I'm not doing Space Harrier today.

1773
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,420
I am doing Knuckles Chaotix.

1774
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,220
Knuckles Chaotix is cool.

1775
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,860
Cue that beautiful bean footage.

1776
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,860
I'm trying.

1777
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:53,860
It's going to take me a minute.

1778
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:57,420
The YouTubey is buffering, so tell us a little bit about Knuckles Chaotix.

1779
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:02,580
Knuckles Chaotix in Japan was called just Chaotix, and it does feature Knuckles and

1780
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:09,380
a bunch of his buddies, um, hanging out, um, on a, uh, different island, and Knuckles is,

1781
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,380
whoa.

1782
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,380
Sorry.

1783
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,380
Anyway.

1784
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:17,580
Um, but basically, you actually have different buddies that go along with you.

1785
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,780
It's a, it's a buddy system game where you're joined by rings, and a band joins the rings

1786
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,780
together.

1787
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:29,620
So, like, say that you are using Knuckles as your main guy, then Knuckles will be able

1788
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:33,220
to climb up walls and, and float across.

1789
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:40,820
Um, you can actually use, um, I think that Espio does, like, some type of drill move

1790
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:45,100
or something, but the whole point of the game is to use a buddy system to make it through

1791
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,700
the five different worlds in the game.

1792
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:48,700
They're called attractions.

1793
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:54,140
And, you know, get to the end and, you know, kick, you know, Mecha Sonic's ass and tell

1794
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,540
Eggman he can piss off.

1795
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:02,300
Um, some of the characters in the game actually, um, did make it into Sonic Heroes, um, that

1796
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:11,540
would be Espio, Vector, and, uh, Charmy, and, um, but every, but also the other thing about

1797
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,940
this game is that it's one of the first to have, um, at least on the 32X, I think, that

1798
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:21,580
had a battery backup on its own, um, which would save your game and you could go back

1799
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:30,500
to it at any time, um, it's really just, and I'm sure you're watching the gameplay right

1800
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,500
now, right?

1801
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,460
Yeah, and to be honest, since I never had a 32X or a Sega Genesis, I mean, sure, I played

1802
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:39,540
Sonic the Hedgehog at my friend's house, but I never really played this game, like, ever,

1803
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:44,420
so, but it looks a lot like regular Sonic, but with a little bit of his buddy action

1804
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,420
kind of going on.

1805
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:48,980
Well, the other thing about that is that you do, um, you've also got your, uh, bonus stages

1806
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:52,380
and special stages, um, your bonus stage, you collect 20 more rings by jumping through

1807
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:56,500
large rings that are hidden in the level, um, you've got, uh, spiral free falls and

1808
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:03,420
that sort of thing, um, and you also, uh, uh, have, uh, the special stages where you're

1809
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:10,100
going through a, um, hexagonal, um, 3D course, and I think that the characters in this, I

1810
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:17,900
do want to say, were, um, actually, um, rendered, um, in 3D for this game.

1811
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,380
I do want to say that they were, don't quote me on that quite yet.

1812
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:29,260
Um, also now, for the people who were into the really, really obscure, there was something

1813
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:35,340
that came out on the Genesis emulators back in the day that was called Sonic Crackers.

1814
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,540
Do you ever remember this, Rob?

1815
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,940
Uh, no.

1816
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:45,660
Sonic Crackers, um, which had also been titled the Sonic Stadium and Sonic the Hedgehog 4,

1817
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:51,460
was a game featuring Sonic and Tails linked by rings, and the very interesting thing about

1818
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:59,940
this is that it was pretty much officially called, um, a, uh, the prototype for Knuckles

1819
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:05,140
Chaotix, um, proven by the fact that in one of the early Chaotix, um, builds, actually

1820
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:10,040
the December 7th, 1994 build, the same sprites for Sonic and Tails were found, although my

1821
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:14,260
personal theory is that Sonic and Tails were just used, because it's their Sonic 1 sprites,

1822
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:18,460
were used for, um, developmental purposes, to, you know, to build the engine, and, you

1823
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:24,080
know, there's, um, levels that actually cross over that have big similarities to levels

1824
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:29,820
that were in, um, Chaotix, so, um, it's, it's very, very interesting, I mean, it's really,

1825
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:33,900
you know, half the game, you get through with repeating levels and lots of deterioration

1826
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:41,300
in the data, but, um, there's, uh, actually Amy, um, Amy Rose is in the sound test on

1827
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:45,540
Knuckles Chaotix, and there's actually a way to, on certain copies of it, to, uh, switch

1828
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:50,200
out, I don't remember which of the characters it is, but you can do a code that switches

1829
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:56,980
out, um, one of the characters for Sonic, for that same, uh, sprite, um, and then there's

1830
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:03,060
also, um, some of the level music in here, different versions of the same music was heard

1831
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:09,720
in, um, uh, Sonic Crackers, also, um, one of the Chaotix builds was labeled as Sonic

1832
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:20,260
Crackers 32X, so, alright, so we've had a, looks interesting, uh, it's one of those Sonic

1833
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:23,780
games I never really got the chance to play, so hopefully it'll come out, I mean, I know,

1834
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,180
um, game time's been adding 32X games, maybe it's on there and I just haven't noticed it,

1835
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:31,340
it might be on there, I love these stages, alright, but this is a bonus stage we're looking

1836
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:36,620
at right now, that's actually a special stage, the Hexagon 3D one, oh, cool, and, um, actually

1837
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:42,540
it's something that you might think is cool is that, uh, the stage, um, set up for this

1838
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:49,420
actually, um, made its way into Sonic Advance, something similar to this, um, I'm sorry,

1839
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:56,340
the bonus stage one that made it into Sonic Advance. Alright, there you have it, Knuckles

1840
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,460
Chaotix, your classic game of the week, check it out on the Sega 32X if you actually have

1841
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:08,900
one. I have, like, two. Can you send one to one of our listeners? Um, I'll ask. Anyhow,

1842
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:12,020
that's gonna do it for this part A of our Orange Lounge Radio, we've been running awfully

1843
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,740
long here, almost like an hour and a half into it, so we're gonna take a break, we'll
