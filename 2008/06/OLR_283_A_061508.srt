1
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:18,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 15, 2008, does Nintendo think you are a geek?

2
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:20,736
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you get your picture in Street Fighter IV?

3
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:24,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And many new role-playing games get dated for the Xbox 360.

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,260
[SPEAKER_05]: TechMasterLoki

5
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:56,581
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Loki?

6
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:57,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing fine.

7
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:14,975
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had some changes in studio.

8
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can see it on Justin TV.

9
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:27,079
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are bitching on Justin TV because it's kind of blurry tonight because we just don't have the bandwidth right now to put out a really clear image and the way we have things hooked up as a crappy resolution.

10
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:27,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Not revolution.

11
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, JTV Revolution.

12
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,983
[SPEAKER_05]: TV TV Revolution?

13
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:33,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

14
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:35,365
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like complete crap.

15
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:38,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully you can make out that Loki finally has a real chair.

16
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:42,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this nice blue little fluffy chair thing going on.

17
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the chair that Jamie used to have.

18
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:45,314
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a couch now.

19
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because now there is a couch over there.

20
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can show the people on Justin TV about the couch.

21
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you untangle yourself from the chair there.

23
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they can see that.

24
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:00,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a couch.

25
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:07,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have to fix the camera, so we better start off tonight's show with a little bit of How was your gaming week, Loki?

26
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:10,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play a whole lot this week.

27
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant to, but I just got distracted.

28
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:20,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 100% complete now with Grand Theft Auto 4, so I've got the achievement and all that fun stuff.

29
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:29,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I finally got my video set up at home working, so I'm recording video now of gameplay, and I can do direct feed stuff now.

30
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,921
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:48,375
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the evil swing set does is if you drive your car up to said evil swing set and leave it there for a second, it will fling you way into the air.

33
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hilarious.

34
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:37,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was playing around with that most of the weekend and recording video and now I've edited it down and I'm trying to put something together coherent with it and hopefully we'll see a lot more of these things.

35
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:41,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might actually have something on our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel.

36
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:41,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

37
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we haven't had anything on there in like two years.

38
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:49,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last thing that's on there is when you and Jamie were interviewed by the news station about Guitar Hero 1.

39
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:50,898
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty old.

40
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the last thing that's on there.

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.

42
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to hear we have some updates.

43
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:55,241
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

44
00:03:55,981 --> 00:04:03,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a video camera too, so I'm hoping I can do some stuff as well, especially with Penny Arcade Expo around the corner, which I still need to book my flight for.

45
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a very bad boy, but I do plan on going.

46
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:06,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be fun.

47
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And BlizzCon.

48
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:08,569
[SPEAKER_05]: BlizzCon's definite as well.

49
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:17,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I did pick up Blastworks this week, and I actually meant to do stuff with it, but Nellie was playing Speed Racer a lot this week.

50
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,574
[SPEAKER_04]: She really has found a game she loves, huh?

51
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:30,519
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's already bored of it, because she's gotten to a part now where it's so hard that she can't go any further, so she's kind of given up on it and going back to reading.

52
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,182
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no, I actually have Blastworks, and I meant to do some really cool stuff with it, but...

53
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:39,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Starfox ships in Blastworks

54
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:01,024
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So, definitely worth checking out.

56
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you want to see that, just head on to our very archaic website at orangeloungeradio.com.

57
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,621
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to get a new website.

58
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:32,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, someday.

59
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:33,882
[SPEAKER_05]: We really need to look into that.

60
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:46,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And go to our forums, and you're going to click on the OL Army clans, and you go to the Blastworks custom data thread, and let's see.

61
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's the Apollo Justice.

62
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:48,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look at that.

63
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:48,864
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cute.

64
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,425
[SPEAKER_05]: The OLR billboard made by GS68.

65
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:52,205
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.

66
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,206
[SPEAKER_05]: and some more ships there that he made.

67
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:54,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

68
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

69
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:58,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's one thing.

70
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:06,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this game is going to catch a lot of people by surprise because there's so much you can make with it and there's that online community where you can share stuff, download other things.

71
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:15,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you get done playing the game and unlocking the four other games in it, I mean, you can practically play all new games forever.

72
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:16,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty awesome.

73
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:18,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Karazhan

74
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was that, but I have been playing other games.

75
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:40,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I checked out the demo for Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.

76
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:49,103
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a game I've been pretty excited about because if you've listened to the show before, you know I love old school Civilization, like the very first one that was on the PCs back in the early 90s.

77
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:53,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this game to bits, even as much as most console games.

78
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's probably my favorite PC game of all time, certainly.

79
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:00,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to see how it translated to console, and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed.

80
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I think...

81
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:07,655
[SPEAKER_05]: They took out a lot of micromanaging that made Civilization really complicated.

82
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:18,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not to say it's bad, because playing Civilization Revolution, I also went back to go play Civilization IV, which I had skipped, because I wasn't all that big on Civilization III.

83
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:20,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, nothing's ever going to live up to the original.

84
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:28,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually really enjoyed Civilization 4, even though there's more of that micromanaging and you actually have to kind of manage your settlers and all that going on there.

85
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:39,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But in Civilization Revolution, they've really kind of, I think, I guess streamlined a lot of it to make it more accessible to a newbie and made it just feel more like a casual gaming experience.

86
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe that's what it is.

87
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel weird calling Civilization a casual game because it's really not.

88
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But they made it...

89
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess a little easier but I don't want to say they dumbed it down because Civilization is a very smart game.

90
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

91
00:07:54,255 --> 00:08:04,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that I'm not really looking forward to Civilization but Red Alert 3 is going to be coming out later this year and that might be something I have to look at.

92
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that's coming out on consoles?

93
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on the Xbox 360 and I think PC.

94
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be pretty awesome.

95
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:13,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Um

96
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:14,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge Red Alert fan, though.

97
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:15,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

98
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:20,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more of the PC Red Alert because I like cheating my ass off in that game.

99
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:27,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially playing with the rules I&I files and stuff like that and adding the school bus of death and fun stuff like that.

100
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:28,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

101
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

102
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:32,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, other games I played this week.

103
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:40,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess there was just the Civilization 4, and then for some reason I had like a night of Atari 2600 gaming, thanks to GameTap.

104
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:47,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back and played Kaboom, and went back and played Freeway, and all these just like crazy 2600 games that I remember from the past.

105
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was all good.

106
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:51,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was really it.

107
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

108
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:55,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember, what came out on Xbox Live Arcade this week?

109
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this Commando this week?

110
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:02,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I wanted to check that out, but I just never got around to that.

111
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so DarkSakura is settling in.

112
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:06,717
[SPEAKER_05]: She just got here.

113
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate people.

114
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:09,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I hate people too.

115
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:11,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate people that get in my way.

116
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,179
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

117
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:15,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a good gaming week?

118
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,441
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought Crystal Castles for the Atari 2600 today.

119
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:26,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dragon something that's the Genesis equivalent of Devil's Crush.

120
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't even know this game.

121
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:31,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot the name.

122
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of... I'm sure a chatter will think of it.

123
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:35,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orange.com if you want to join in the fun.

124
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally found the one movie I've been looking for.

125
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:44,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been finding it expensive, even used, and I was pissed off, but I finally found it for $10.

126
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:45,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what's that?

127
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:46,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypercube.

128
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:48,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

129
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,873
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Cube 3, right?

130
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:50,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Cube 2.

131
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:50,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

132
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,988
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't seen it, you can come over and watch it with me because it's the awesome one.

133
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen Cube 2 or Cube 3.

134
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the original Cube.

135
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Cube would be a pretty badass video game, wouldn't it?

136
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to tell you, someone has made a Hypercube mod for Half-Life.

137
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

138
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:13,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Hypercube just because it has to do with weird physics.

139
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that Carl Sagan talked about.

140
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:22,476
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in our chat at chat.orange.com says Keystone Capers for the win.

141
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,477
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of Atari 2600 left tonight.

142
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,579
[SPEAKER_05]: What possessed you to go get Crystal Castles for the 2600?

143
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at Dimple and it was there.

144
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:32,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we bought it.

145
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:33,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, alrighty.

146
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost bought Season 5 of Bullshit.

147
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,894
[SPEAKER_05]: How far can you get in Crystal Castles?

148
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,695
[SPEAKER_03]: is sitting in a chair using his feet.

149
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:10,656
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.

150
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:15,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that is pretty amazing.

151
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:17,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid computer.

152
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:22,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're always on the cutting edge of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio playing Atari 2600 games this week.

153
00:11:22,218 --> 00:11:23,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut plenty of edges of stuff.

154
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually paper cuts on the manuals.

155
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we also had a good bit of Metal Gear Solid 4 being beaten twice over in my house.

156
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's what the other one was.

157
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:35,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogger 2.

158
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:37,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

159
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I think probably better left forgotten.

160
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

161
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:40,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

162
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,544
[SPEAKER_05]: The Frogger games weren't all bad.

163
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,345
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to hear about... The hell with Frogger.

164
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:46,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear about Metal Gear Solid 4 because I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner.

165
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:50,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf live because, you know, he's on live before us over at allgames.com.

166
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of his callers called in to just rave about the game.

167
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,673
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I know you've been a Solid Snake fan for a while.

168
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:58,114
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

169
00:11:58,294 --> 00:11:59,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty epic.

170
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:00,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty epic.

171
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:01,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan hurt his fingers playing.

172
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,097
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually got a cramp in his middle finger.

173
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

174
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:05,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

175
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, my man, hardcore gamer.

176
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure he's showing it off to everybody.

177
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what I heard.

178
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what I heard.

179
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:12,666
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

180
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:14,467
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been talking about it, though.

181
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:19,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, though, it's got like the longest fucking ending in the universe.

182
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:23,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also the biggest WTF ending in the universe, which I'm not going to say more than that.

183
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:24,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

184
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has plenty of my man in it.

185
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:28,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm like the only one that likes Raiden.

186
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:28,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Raiden.

187
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:28,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Raiden.

188
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: and on top of that it's a lot of Raiden kicking ass until he doesn't kick ass and that's not all I'm going to say about that but I have to say that I'm overall pleased with the project and give Kojima and team mad props for doing a good job I don't know if you can say this without spoiling so you can say I can't answer but does it leave the door open to Metal Gear Solid 5?

189
00:12:58,388 --> 00:12:59,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

190
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:00,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

191
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a dog ending?

192
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,791
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Silent Hill, dummy.

193
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:04,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

194
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:05,132
[SPEAKER_05]: They can branch out.

195
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:07,873
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

196
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:14,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have to say that I was sitting in my little hole in the house, being the computer room.

197
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:16,398
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about.

198
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:16,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah.

199
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, I hear the Snake Eater theme.

200
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what?

201
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:26,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have to say that for fans of the older series...

202
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:40,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got... There's major, major nods to the old Metal Gear series, and I'm not going to tell you what they are, but it's really, really... Fucking epic.

203
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:43,449
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that they do it is really cool.

204
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:51,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't support this game in any way also, by the way, because Solid Snake in the game uses an Apple iPod.

205
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:53,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shut up.

206
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:54,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he...

207
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,754
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there is an Apple iPod in there.

208
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:57,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shut up.

209
00:13:57,234 --> 00:14:05,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't remember seeing any of that going on in the game because they were too busy shooting stuff and talking about love on the battlefield.

210
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Love is a battlefield.

211
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:16,122
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's been like this constant, you know, spiritual metaphor for... Do you know what would make Metal Gear Solid 4 better?

212
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:17,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake not being old?

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,623
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was a musical.

214
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the whole... You know what my subtitle for this game has been?

215
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:24,146
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

216
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:32,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 4, Damn Snake You Got Old Metal Gear Solid 4, Damn Snake You Got Old

217
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:55,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Careful with putting that mic there because the fan... Our studio has been rearranged, I was telling the listeners earlier.

218
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Jamie gets her own couch.

219
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:59,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for her to kick her feet up one night.

220
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:01,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work there either.

221
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:02,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to put it next to you or something.

222
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:03,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the ferret?

223
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:04,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my baby?

224
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:08,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Your ferret is used in our D&D game, so it's in the house.

225
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You're playing D&D and not tell me?

226
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanna come play?

227
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:14,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I can invite you.

228
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,030
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like level 4.

229
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

230
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a level 6 wereweasel.

231
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,051
[SPEAKER_05]: 50,000 nerd points with our listeners.

232
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the uber nerd now.

233
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a level 6 wereweasel.

234
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:25,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a bard.

235
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:26,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a level 4 bard.

236
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoonie bard?

237
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:30,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a sassy bard, not a spoonie bard.

238
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,353
[SPEAKER_03]: My wereweasel has tasted of human before.

239
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:37,994
[SPEAKER_05]: But the ferret, because somebody has a ferret familiar in the game, so we actually use the ferret as the ferret.

240
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:41,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember Mel and Eric from the DDR days, right?

241
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:42,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

242
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:43,567
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I D&D with.

243
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,588
[SPEAKER_05]: The ferret is Mel's companion.

244
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will talk to peeps.

245
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it's on Tuesday, I can't do it.

246
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:50,810
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Tuesday.

247
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like weekends usually.

248
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:52,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

249
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,091
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

250
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:53,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

251
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:54,451
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

252
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:58,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Valerno in chat is asking, who's breathing into their mic?

253
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:01,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fan thing, and I'm not going to do anything about it, so shut up.

254
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fan.

255
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:07,085
[SPEAKER_05]: All she has to do is put her mic down, like not on the arm, but on the, yeah, just leave it in your cleavage.

256
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:07,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fine.

257
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:11,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Or put it, just put it below the arm so the fan's not blowing on it.

258
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:11,449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

259
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:19,113
[SPEAKER_03]: My face is above the arm line, so I need a shield over the mic.

260
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenocore says, Sky, you better be playing version 4 or you're lame.

261
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We started playing before 4 was out, because 4 just came out.

262
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

263
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:33,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck everybody, because it's all about version 2.

264
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Why you gotta bring Thacco into this?

265
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:39,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, I can still calculate Thacco.

266
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:41,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look.

267
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:45,285
[SPEAKER_05]: We've really got to get back to video games.

268
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say another quick thing about Metal Gear Solid 4.

269
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I just noticed this on Dig earlier today.

270
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:54,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, GameSpot has given Metal Gear Solid 4 a 10 out of 10.

271
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only the sixth game in history to do so.

272
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:00,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this is a game that's deserving of all the praise?

273
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:01,314
[SPEAKER_03]: What did Famitsu give it?

274
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:02,195
[SPEAKER_05]: A 40.

275
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:04,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's deserving?

276
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust Famitsu over GameStop.

277
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:10,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they also gave Nintendogs a 40, if I remember right.

278
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendogs was great.

279
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,541
[SPEAKER_05]: For five minutes.

280
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,065
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

281
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:31,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Xenocore in chat says, fuck Thacco.

282
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:36,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, Kikoman2DX says they apparently took bards out of four.

283
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, fuck 4th edition if that's the case.

284
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it right in its ear.

285
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:39,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

286
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:43,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about 2nd edition and playing a freaking, uh, uh, Bladesinger.

287
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:44,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

288
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:45,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about it.

289
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:47,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough D&D chat.

290
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:50,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about custom spells and the flesh-to-toast spell.

291
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:51,271
What?

292
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:54,634
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, the best spell ever, and I have to tell everybody about this.

293
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:59,917
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Derek, by the way, I know you're not listening, but congratulations for getting married last week.

294
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:07,502
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a character named Blackstar who created a spell called Blackstar's Instant Chaos.

295
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:15,507
[SPEAKER_03]: and so far I think we got to about five pages but it was supposed to be ten pages of a hundred effects so the spell would have a thousand effects.

296
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:16,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Random.

297
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had Jesus in our game before.

298
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,330
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had golf umbrellas pop up.

299
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:24,213
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had a Mortal Kombat machine land on a lich.

300
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of funny things happen in this game.

301
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:33,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And also one of my characters actually had a breast enlargement by accident because of the spell.

302
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk video games now?

303
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd share that.

304
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,863
[SPEAKER_03]: The best spell ever.

305
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:43,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like that, and I fully endorse that in any upcoming RPG.

306
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:02,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Father's Day!

307
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Allgames.com was hacksword earlier this week, which kind of sucks.

308
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:34,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why people keep hacking allgames.com because they are only doing good for the gaming community, but I guess some people want to hack it just because they can and like the challenge.

309
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:40,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So folks are having to listen to us tonight directly through allgamesradio.com.

310
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:47,893
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I hear, though, allgames.com is completely being redesigned, and there's going to be a complete new site in its place soon.

311
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish someone would do the same for OrangeLoungeRadio.com because damn, our old site's getting old.

312
00:19:54,054 --> 00:20:02,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week on the show, episode number 284 is the sixth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

313
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:07,358
[SPEAKER_05]: A day early for all practical sake, but it's the closest day that falls to our anniversary.

314
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio was June 23rd, 2002.

315
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a suggestion now!

316
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

317
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:10,818
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

318
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

319
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, let Travis roast the hoats.

320
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:17,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that idea.

321
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I could take that.

322
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,707
[SPEAKER_02]: As if he hasn't enough outside the show.

323
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:25,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty says, but I know has any ideas.

324
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:25,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Cry.

325
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Make one.

326
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:32,257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, look, we got a lot of gaming news to get to tonight.

327
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We have late-breaking news.

328
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:43,449
[SPEAKER_05]: For all practical purposes, this was a slow news week up until about two, three hours ago when I think the roof just got blown off of something.

329
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:44,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, these are rumors.

330
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:46,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what the hell's going on?

331
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:46,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Update us on the latest.

332
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:47,954
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't even on our...

333
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:48,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Intela Sponce

334
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:03,409
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

335
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:24,202
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

336
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:49,193
[SPEAKER_04]: But it says, avatars are digital personas available this holiday for all Xbox Live connected members and this spring for all new console owners.

337
00:22:49,794 --> 00:23:02,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Avatars will be used in place of the gamer picture you have today and give you a much more lifelike, animated, fully customizable persona for you to reflect who you are online.

338
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,920
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting these.

339
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say these are a step up from Mii's, but essentially, yeah.

340
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,245
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Mii's second mix.

341
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:12,827
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

342
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:13,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Mii Club Mix?

343
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:14,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

344
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:15,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

345
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's see here.

346
00:23:19,753 --> 00:23:19,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 4

347
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say that's about right.

348
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:43,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And some new information about the Guitar Hero 4 guitar.

349
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:53,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be upgraded and will feature new touch sensitive neck which will allow you to do neck slides and opens up the entire guitar neck for unbound solos.

350
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:55,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Shred how you want.

351
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of the artists that they mentioned for Guitar Hero 4.

352
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:06,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, Interpol, Muse, and dozens more.

353
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:09,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here.

354
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:19,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there is some information about... Remember a while ago, Lips appeared on a press site for some Microsoft announcement or whatever?

355
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:19,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, yes.

356
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:27,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Lips is a music and singing game that's going to include 30 songs and two wireless interactive microphones.

357
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:33,045
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability to use and sing your own music or download songs from an online service.

358
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:35,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It's designed to have fun with your friends.

359
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:39,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Lips scores you on your singing, pitch, rhythm, and tune, and overall performance.

360
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:43,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The wireless mics are interactive with lights on the shaft of the microphone.

361
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:44,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

362
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:10,082
[SPEAKER_04]: The game will reduce the vocals down so that you can sing along and be heard and score on whether you're in tune or not.

363
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:13,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Lyrics can be added directly into the song to sing out loud.

364
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:20,308
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a new Tony Hawk game that's going to be using a motion sensing device.

365
00:25:20,948 --> 00:25:24,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Board Controller on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

366
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,671
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm going to try to find this here real quick.

367
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from chat while you're looking for that.

368
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:38,634
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru said, I don't know, but people are going to be pissed.

369
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:42,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with all these news stories coming out, did E3 just get ruined?

370
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:47,581
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of their big, I think, big splashes may have gotten ruined a little bit.

371
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:55,106
[SPEAKER_05]: With this whole... So, wait, we have Microsoft... Okay, they've taken the Miis and made it a little better with the whole avatars thing.

372
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:55,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

373
00:25:55,606 --> 00:26:03,411
[SPEAKER_05]: They've taken the whole Karaoke Revolution SingStar thing and made it a little better with this lips thing and this whole, like, you can put in any song, you get the vocals taken out.

374
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:06,593
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a big freaking deal, although it probably won't work perfectly.

375
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still kind of a neat feature that the other games don't have.

376
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

377
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:16,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you can do, I can do better I can do anything better than you Yes I can, yes I can Yes I can, yes I can Anything you can do

378
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:39,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

379
00:26:53,809 --> 00:27:00,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to an intuitive board-based control scheme, it's never been easier to pull off amazing tricks and feel the sensation of skateboarding.

380
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Shift your weight to turn and balance grinds.

381
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:08,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick back on the tail of the board to ollie and lean into airs and pull off huge spins.

382
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:17,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel the sensation of dropping the 60-foot mega ramp, bombing down the world's steepest streets, and watching Earth disappear behind your board as you launch out of a half-pipe.

383
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:18,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Next gen...

384
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:37,632
[SPEAKER_04]: graphics amplify the fun as you ride thrilling situations like these put down the controller step on the board and feel the sensation of going big and they say it's going to be $59.99 for the PS3 and Xbox 360 I'm guessing if it's going to come with a board it's not going to be that price anyways let's see here

385
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:40,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii on your PC.

386
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:45,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these games are only available on consoles today and with this new feature you would now be able to

387
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,415
[SPEAKER_04]: They will now be available on the PC as well.

388
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:05,698
[SPEAKER_04]: This is with this feature.

389
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Those console games are now playable on your PC.

390
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the same game controllers as the original console systems.

391
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,672
[SPEAKER_04]: All games use regular console controllers, not your computer, keyboard, or mouse.

392
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:38,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, see, I read an interesting theory on that whole thread that was going on on NeoGAF where, you know, this whole thing exploded, that Trioxide was a possible codename for Xbox 360, because they saw some prices in here, $49 and $299, and people were speculating that maybe $49 is the new price of, like, the controllers, and $299 is this new system SKU that a lot of folks are speculating Microsoft's going to drop on us at E3.

393
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I guess it's not uncommon for Xbox to use names of, like...

394
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:45,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Chemicals, because I think helium was a codename of theirs once.

395
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, trioxide, let's see, that would be... Ozone?

396
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, O3, no?

397
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:52,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

398
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

399
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:55,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is why... Yeah, that would be ozone.

400
00:28:55,752 --> 00:29:00,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is why we're in this territory of, it's rumors, but slightly above it.

401
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:03,054
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, there's gotta be some fact to this.

402
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this company is legit... There's a lot of smoke coming from this.

403
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:07,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

404
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:08,135
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's...

405
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:17,117
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably some red herrings amongst this because what these people did is they were basically sending out surveys, marketing research.

406
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:31,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how this whole thing got blown is that if you go to one of those websites, ran this whole avatars thing because somebody sent it to them confidentially from this website that they were being asked about this whole avatars thing on a research.

407
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:33,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then that link got taken and...

408
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:37,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people blew it wide open and found all the other surveys that were out there, too.

409
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:38,685
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how this whole thing started.

410
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:44,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, there's some legitimacy to this underneath, but there's still a lot being drafted, too.

411
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see what else we've got here.

412
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Scenic Pop Culture Edition.

413
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes perfect sense that they've already come out with a scenic game.

414
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:55,918
[SPEAKER_04]: The groundwork's already there, so I can see that happening.

415
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:58,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme Makeover Home Edition for the Wii and DS.

416
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:58,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

417
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:00,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that too.

418
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:02,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Gossip Girl for the Wii and DS.

419
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:03,318
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

420
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimate Band for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

421
00:30:07,802 --> 00:30:12,526
[SPEAKER_04]: That, if I remember correctly, Ultimate Band, I know for the Wii, is a Buena Vista game.

422
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:14,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Disney Interactive.

423
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:14,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

424
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:18,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a band game that does not use instruments.

425
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:19,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that's already been announced.

426
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:21,814
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play Hannah Montana songs to your heart's content.

427
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:22,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, yeah.

428
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Yoga, which I guess is supposed to follow along an inspirational yoga guru, instructor, matching machine, all these on-screen poses, stretches.

429
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there Yoga and Wii Fit?

430
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is something else.

431
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,976
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of yoga games out there, trust me.

432
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them.

433
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:39,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to sell them.

434
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:40,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

435
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some stuff on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, too.

436
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:46,443
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of... Because this is a lot of Activision stuff on here.

437
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:55,329
[SPEAKER_04]: In this new Marvel Ultimate Alliance action role-playing game, Civil War erupts, and the world's greatest heroes and villains must choose sides.

438
00:30:55,429 --> 00:31:04,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Select your side in the conflict and assemble your team of a roster of 20 Marvel Legends, including Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, and the Human Torch.

439
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Combine your team's power, blah, blah, blah.

440
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:07,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It says...

441
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:10,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies

442
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:35,032
[SPEAKER_03]: The Marvel Zombies series is just crazy.

443
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:35,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

444
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:37,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you have read any of them, but they're nuts.

445
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:40,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was an Army of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies 2.

446
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:45,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be a set in the popular Marvel Zombies comic series.

447
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:51,860
[SPEAKER_04]: You assume the role of Spider-Man and must save the world from zombie menaces that threaten to destroy it.

448
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Play this adventure game in an open city, free-swinging environment in a war-torn Earth.

449
00:31:56,822 --> 00:32:00,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game takes place in the year 2149 in a warped version of Earth.

450
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:01,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

451
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:09,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight against other Marvel heroes and villains who have already succumbed to the zombie horde, or become a zombie yourself.

452
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.

453
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:14,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing that's probably coming out next year sometime.

454
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Transformers 2.

455
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably will suck, because the first one really sucked.

456
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously this is something that's way far away, but...

457
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Spider-Man Game Using the Balance Board

458
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:55,623
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be Spider-Man's heart that keeps him going, or maybe his strength.

459
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Step into Spider-Man's shoes and decide for yourself.

460
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:03,166
[SPEAKER_04]: One jump, leap, stomp, and kick at a time.

461
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:09,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Climb atop your Wii Fit board to control Spider-Man's acrobatic abilities like never before.

462
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:13,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Lean one way or the other to send Spider-Man's story into the air.

463
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:18,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump as high as you can to propel Spider-Man off of Manhattan's tallest rooftops.

464
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:22,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see how you could do that because they don't want you jumping on the Wii balance board.

465
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:24,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting.

466
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:25,977
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

467
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:28,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

468
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:32,201
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says the sequel is going to be called Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen.

469
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:33,202
[SPEAKER_05]: From our chat room.

470
00:33:35,035 --> 00:33:36,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 5, Forza 3, Cars and Tracks

471
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:14,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Key features of Forza 3 include highly detailed real world cars and track models, over 400 cars and 100 tracks, near limitless customization options for cartooning and custom artwork, a variety of online community features, highly accurate racing simulation,

472
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:20,998
[SPEAKER_04]: including real-world damage, new race modes, drag, drift, oval, point-to-point racing, etc.

473
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:25,520
[SPEAKER_04]: A powerful assist system to help new players get into the game quickly.

474
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And... what else?

475
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:34,683
[SPEAKER_04]: But all that is subject to change, obviously, because he probably thinks... Yeah, this is all stuff that's going on right now, and it says also imagine that...

476
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:36,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

477
00:34:56,807 --> 00:35:00,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra service space for photos and videos and a free month of live.

478
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:06,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And the collector's edition will also include exclusive motorsports content not found anywhere else.

479
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:11,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says this can be anything from authentic racing gear, gloves, helmets, etc.

480
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's especially created automobile and manufactured gear, branded jackets, etc.

481
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,666
[SPEAKER_04]: to VIP motorsport event tickets.

482
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that sounds kind of cool, but this stuff is so early that it's probably just...

483
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: What they want to do, and they're also kind of getting people's opinions on this stuff.

484
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:34,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you dig even deeper in that NeoGAF thread, people kept finding more stuff on that site.

485
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:42,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know, I didn't read into how the security hole was opened or whatever, but... It basically, well, I saw it earlier before they took everything down.

486
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:43,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's fixed now?

487
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:45,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, it is fixed now.

488
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:48,593
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some other stuff that was on there, too, including there's a game for...

489
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:53,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Crucible that they had a video for.

490
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:59,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Planet Emergency Vet was a game that was on there, you know, like the show on Animal Planet.

491
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:02,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Nye Science Lab on the Wii.

492
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,369
[SPEAKER_05]: No joke, Bill Nye the Science Guy finally gets a Wii game.

493
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,849
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like one of our dream games, wasn't it?

494
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:08,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

495
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And then get this.

496
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,450
[SPEAKER_05]: You Don't Know Jack on the Wii.

497
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:12,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally.

498
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally this game's coming back.

499
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:15,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

500
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:16,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I know two other games that haven't been...

501
00:36:18,228 --> 00:36:20,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell's Kitchen The Price is Right Wii and DS

502
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,655
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't play Plinko at home.

503
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:42,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.

504
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:43,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

505
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:44,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not the same.

506
00:36:44,678 --> 00:36:45,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

507
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:46,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

508
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,781
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a Price is Right game on Commodore 64, didn't they?

509
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Years ago?

510
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:51,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some pretty old ones.

511
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:58,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seeing some other stuff on here too, and I'm sure a lot of people now are starting to make up stuff to go along with this.

512
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,111
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

513
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:04,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

514
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very interesting.

515
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:31,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they do have a lot of stuff up their sleeves.

516
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:34,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said they had a few aces still up their sleeves for stuff.

517
00:37:34,558 --> 00:37:37,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, ace avatar, I don't know.

518
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: SG100Matt says in chat, Price is right for the Wii.

519
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:43,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Itagaki better do it so he get the bouncy titties.

520
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:47,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know that's why people watch the Price is Right.

521
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:47,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

522
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on down!

523
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonga bonga bonga bonga.

524
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad it's all grandma's.

525
00:37:54,378 --> 00:38:05,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we were saying back last week, how Itagari would do, how I appear he would do a press event or kicking over stuff, setting things on fire, that kind of thing.

526
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That would apply to Price is Right, too.

527
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be pretty awesome.

528
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be.

529
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:10,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making a Price is Right game, bitch!

530
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:11,896
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

531
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:14,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely lots more to come.

532
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:17,999
[SPEAKER_05]: That story, of course, all still in development, was very new.

533
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,180
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how this develops throughout the week.

534
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, let's get into the news we were going to talk about anyway tonight, even though that took like 20 minutes to cover, but that's pretty big.

535
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:30,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's quickly run through some of the other week's news and let you guys comment.

536
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:31,004
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

537
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:33,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Ossifer says, Microsoft's comment.

538
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:34,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, you didn't just hear that.

539
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:49,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Nintendo is suing Nyko over the Comma Wireless Nunchuck, which doesn't really make much sense to me when I think about it because, you know, people put out third-party accessories all the time.

540
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:55,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Nintendo's just really super anal about people putting out, you know, third-party remotes and nunchucks.

541
00:38:56,094 --> 00:39:00,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Because actually, if you think about it, I remember Mad Catz was putting out a third-party remote that kind of looked like

542
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,439
[SPEAKER_04]: A dildo, but actually that's never come out yet.

543
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:09,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if these people are just getting blocked by Nintendo for this stuff.

544
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:22,104
[SPEAKER_04]: But either way, they are suing them because apparently it appropriates the novel shape, design, overall appearance, and even the color and materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuck controller.

545
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:29,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's also wireless, but apparently it's similar enough and people are thinking, hey, maybe Nintendo's making their own wireless Nunchuck.

546
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:33,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt that, but... I don't know.

547
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:34,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It still sucks.

548
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:40,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you're looking to buy a wireless nunchuck, do it now, before they're pulled from shelves.

549
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this has any merit on Nintendo's part?

550
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:46,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just weird, because there's tons of third-party controllers out there.

551
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Why this one?

552
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:48,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true that, you know...

553
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:55,156
[SPEAKER_04]: They have... It has merit, but at the same time, though, I thought that this stuff has to be approved through Nintendo first.

554
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:59,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, before they make these peripherals, they have to approve it with Nintendo.

555
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:03,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because the same could be said with these, like, you know, the Wii Zapper.

556
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:08,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a bunch of things that came out before the Wii Zapper that were pretty much exactly the same as the Wii Zapper.

557
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:15,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And some things, in fact, you know, Naiko even made a better, you know, peripheral than the Wii Zapper for gun games, but...

558
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:18,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

559
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:45,922
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have been some sort of process where they have to get approval from Nintendo to put out these products.

560
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:47,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I don't know.

561
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:49,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually that's the way it works, I thought.

562
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:53,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we'll see what happens.

563
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:57,969
[SPEAKER_05]: If they get the pants sued off of them or what will happen.

564
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you think Nintendo just wants to put out a wireless thing of their own?

565
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:01,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what's going on?

566
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

567
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:05,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what do you think of this whole lawsuit stuff?

568
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:09,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just Nintendo trying to keep the market under their control.

569
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:16,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Nintendo did this this week, and it's not Nintendo as a company, but one person at Nintendo.

570
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you hire a person like this as your marketing director, he's speaking on behalf of your company.

571
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:23,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy pissed me off this week.

572
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you guys.

573
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:25,249
[SPEAKER_05]: This was...

574
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,351
[SPEAKER_05]: and Edge Magazine.

575
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:39,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo of Europe marketing director, Laurent Fischer, was talking about the whole... He got, of course, as most Nintendo people have, got kind of put on the spot lately while he was talking about WiiWare games.

576
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:41,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the extra storage?

577
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:47,129
[SPEAKER_05]: What about all these people that are filling up their Wii consoles with all this stuff?

578
00:41:47,189 --> 00:41:48,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the extra storage?

579
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, according to Laurent Fischer...

580
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:55,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Only geeks and otaku want the issue addressed.

581
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:57,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the actual quote from the magazine here.

582
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,402
[SPEAKER_05]: You can read their little site online at next-gen.biz.

583
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:11,170
[SPEAKER_05]: When a question about the limited Wii system memory was raised, Nintendo's Laurent Fischer slipped into talking about how geeks and otaku were the only people who would want this issue addressed.

584
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be their entire fan base.

585
00:42:15,894 --> 00:42:16,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Duck.

586
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he went and tried to backtrack a little later.

587
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:21,983
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking to Video Gaming 24-7.

588
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:26,464
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't mean to offend anyone and it's all a misunderstanding.

589
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

590
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much more cut and dried that could be or how that could be misconstrued to mean anything else.

591
00:42:36,328 --> 00:42:46,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek and otaku, first of all, apart from being slightly synonymous except with otaku having a slight bigger social stigma overseas, is still...

592
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Your freaking marketing director?

593
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:54,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to appeal to these people.

594
00:42:54,153 --> 00:43:04,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know Nintendo was trying to get the broader audience and trying to get the moms and grandmoms into it, but still, their core fan base is the nerdy gamer.

595
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:04,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

596
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:27,458
[SPEAKER_05]: and here's the problem, this particular geek has spent lots of money on these virtual console downloads downloading the same shit I played years ago when I could be playing them for free on the internet but no, I decided to support Nintendo I decided to download these games and actually pay the price for them so I could have the official emulator and support the people behind it and this is how we get thanked?

597
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:32,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded ZSNES I know, that's what I'm saying, I could have done that

598
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: and I could have never supported the whole virtual console thing.

599
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:39,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have the space on my drive to do more WiiWare games and I wouldn't have to worry about any of this.

600
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,029
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

601
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the thanks we get for supporting Nintendo.

602
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:45,871
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a geek.

603
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:47,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what?

604
00:43:48,874 --> 00:43:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

605
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:54,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not downloading anything else on Virtual Console.

606
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit.

607
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,871
[SPEAKER_05]: They could put Guardian Legend out on it tomorrow.

608
00:43:57,991 --> 00:43:58,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not getting it.

609
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:01,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I will play it on NES emulators.

610
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:02,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much and be happy.

611
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:05,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not download any more WiiWare titles.

612
00:44:05,593 --> 00:44:10,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not support Nintendo's download service until A, this guy is...

613
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:17,212
[SPEAKER_05]: LetGo, or shifted into another position where he's not speaking on behalf of the company, or B, Nintendo addresses this issue.

614
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:18,393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

615
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:35,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I'm not going to suffer because of one idiot, but, you know, I still... I think that it would probably be a bit more... I would have to say... Well, first of all, they're not going to know that you're doing this if you just do it, and they're not going to listen to our podcast.

616
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:36,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

617
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:40,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping maybe some of the listeners will...

618
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:42,294
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

619
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not put together some type of organized effort to address it?

620
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:12,647
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing to say we're going to do this on the show, but another thing to actually send a letter to Nintendo, to the CEO US, to the ones in the UK.

621
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:18,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you saying I should start some type of blog where I encourage people to send letters and join me in this boycott?

622
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:19,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

623
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:20,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll do it tomorrow.

624
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:22,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're doing it.

625
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:24,052
[SPEAKER_04]: We are?

626
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:25,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it.

627
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:25,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

628
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:27,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're signing it.

629
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm fine with it.

630
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really been downloading anything from Nintendo's WiiWare service anyways.

631
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:35,635
[SPEAKER_03]: My download service actually isn't working, but I did want Pokemon Snap.

632
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:43,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing, is I've been trying to support Nintendo, and that's why, you know, you might just think, Rob, get over it, but it's one of these things where, like, dude, this is the marketing director.

633
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,238
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what he's going to say.

634
00:45:45,258 --> 00:45:46,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that Marketing Director UK?

635
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:48,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

636
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:49,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm saying, you know...

637
00:45:51,947 --> 00:46:05,095
[SPEAKER_03]: The letters have to go to him, to whoever his boss is in Nintendo UK, to over here, and probably even to the overall head officer.

638
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I won't.

639
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:08,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go download it on an emulator and I guess I'll be just fine.

640
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:08,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fine.

641
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you have it.

642
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:23,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what does GameGuru say?

643
00:46:24,036 --> 00:46:26,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo will fix the issue for Animal Crossing at E3.

644
00:46:26,677 --> 00:46:28,518
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't, I will join this boycott.

645
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:40,402
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru, I actually think my boycott will be over by E3 because I think, like I said, I will un-boycott when they address this issue finally and stop pretending it doesn't exist.

646
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it doesn't get addressed, then it just justifies the boycott even more.

647
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So, bleh.

648
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing is you've got to get enough people to

649
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,578
[SPEAKER_03]: to participate.

650
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:56,079
[SPEAKER_05]: ShadowTri says, oh, now you go back on it.

651
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:56,439
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

652
00:46:56,479 --> 00:47:00,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the boycott will be over when A, this guy gets let go or B, Nintendo addresses the issue.

653
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's widely anticipated that Nintendo will address the issue at E3 with some type of storage device.

654
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:10,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think they're going to come out at E3 and say, hey, just for geeks and otakus, this new storage device.

655
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's still fucking lame anyways because your average anybody that's using the Wii console needs a storage space because they didn't think it through very well.

656
00:47:18,788 --> 00:47:20,949
[SPEAKER_04]: They were trying to cut costs to make this thing very

657
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:24,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you bragging that there's a hundred... I'm sorry, this isn't you, this isn't Nintendo.

658
00:47:24,732 --> 00:47:32,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you bragging that there's a hundred plus different games you can download on virtual console when your stupid thing won't even hold more than twenty?

659
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:41,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one other thing, though, that I would like to say is that Nintendo does have a track record for creating the demand for something.

660
00:47:42,497 --> 00:47:46,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when people are worked up enough about it, they'll release the product.

661
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:58,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would not be at all surprised if they didn't have something like this already in mind, that they put out this massive amount of downloadable content, stuff that's going to fill up all this space.

662
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when people are like, what do we do?

663
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:01,431
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do?

664
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:04,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo comes to save the day with a storage unit.

665
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:05,493
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something like that.

666
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:09,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says, somebody called you a geek and you're going to boycott over it.

667
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:10,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, yeah.

668
00:48:11,296 --> 00:48:12,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It was meant in a derogatory fashion.

669
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:20,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because it was meant in a derogatory fashion and if we've been supporting the company for all these years and this is the thanks we get, then I'm not going to support it anymore.

670
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:21,881
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the issue.

671
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:26,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Online plays for Geeks in a Tacos.

672
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:28,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, a...

673
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:30,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Avatars are for geeks and tacos.

674
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:33,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-friend codes are for geeks and tacos.

675
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:34,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Geeks and tacos?

676
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:36,184
[SPEAKER_04]: No, otakus.

677
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get tacos.

678
00:48:37,425 --> 00:48:42,547
[SPEAKER_05]: If he said download things were for tacos, I would be, yeah, tacos are rad.

679
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:48,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to give a GameStop gift certificate to anyone who comes over here and brings us chicken soft tacos.

680
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm serious.

681
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows where we live.

682
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:54,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people do.

683
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I live.

684
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

685
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:57,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I'm done with my rant.

686
00:48:57,959 --> 00:48:59,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we'll get emails on it.

687
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go on to the next story.

688
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:02,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we have that, don't we?

689
00:49:03,224 --> 00:49:03,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

690
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:14,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for people who are going to be downloading this stuff, who may or may not be participating, but only in the UK, we have five new games out on Virtual Console.

691
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:19,180
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Alex Kidd Miracle World, which is a good, good game.

692
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:23,621
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is actually going to be 500 Wii Points.

693
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:38,973
[SPEAKER_03]: There is Last Ninja and Nebulas for Commodore 64 and both of those are 500 Wii Points and then for Neo Geo we have Ninja Combat and Fatal Fury 2 and those are going to be 900 Wii Points.

694
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:42,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, Rob?

695
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:48,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually come over to my house and play Fatal Fury 2 on my Neo Geo.

696
00:49:48,189 --> 00:49:48,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do that.

697
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:49,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to?

698
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:49,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

699
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:49,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

700
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:53,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think those Neo Geo cartridges have more storage than a Nintendo Wii.

701
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,810
[SPEAKER_03]: 512 megabytes.

702
00:49:55,371 --> 00:50:01,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's the same amount of storage in one of those fucking carts than there is in the Nintendo Wii.

703
00:50:01,072 --> 00:50:01,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Same amount.

704
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:04,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that, yeah, they're 512 a piece.

705
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:11,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but flash memory is not that expensive, and I don't understand why they couldn't have added more to this.

706
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:16,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I think seeing as the device will already read a USB thing...

707
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: or will copy to your SD card.

708
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:23,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see... They could do it with a freaking patch.

709
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:28,208
[SPEAKER_05]: They could patch the system to temporarily load things off your SD card into the flash memory.

710
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:29,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're worried about piracy.

711
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

712
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:32,570
[SPEAKER_04]: People are already pirating.

713
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

714
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,872
[SPEAKER_04]: People already know how to do it.

715
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:36,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to matter anymore.

716
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:38,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh well.

717
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: In other news, unrelated to Nintendo, Famitsu Magazine.

718
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:57,123
[SPEAKER_04]: They're definitely one of the most popular game magazines in Japan, and if you want to get your grubby little hands on a subscription, it's going to cost you quite a bit of money.

719
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: However, NCSX is offering import subscriptions to Famitsu Magazine, ranging anywhere in Japan.

720
00:51:05,745 --> 00:51:06,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have the money for this.

721
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:13,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywhere from $480 a year to $2,860 a year.

722
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:19,694
[SPEAKER_04]: $480 per year for 52 issues, because it is a weekly magazine.

723
00:51:19,874 --> 00:51:22,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering they're being shipped from Japan, that's actually not that bad.

724
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:22,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

725
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:23,657
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also do the same thing through Yahoo.

726
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:24,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd let you know.

727
00:51:24,597 --> 00:51:25,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for media mail.

728
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:26,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Amazon.

729
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:28,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And UPS overnight shipping would be $2,860.

730
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's overnight shipping.

731
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Priority mail is only $626, so...

732
00:51:35,273 --> 00:51:41,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the same thing through Amazon and have been able to for a long time because I had, for a little while, a subscription to the Doctor Who magazine.

733
00:51:42,818 --> 00:51:43,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

734
00:51:44,419 --> 00:51:45,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Geek, otaku.

735
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:46,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, Rob.

736
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:49,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it big fat, so what about that?

737
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:51,084
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing new.

738
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:55,487
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just doing the same thing that you've been able to do for Amazon for ages and ages.

739
00:51:57,488 --> 00:51:58,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with a little competition.

740
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:00,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go to Kinokuniya and buy them every week, too.

741
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:01,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

742
00:52:05,783 --> 00:52:06,524
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

743
00:52:06,804 --> 00:52:10,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is something, you know, overnighting it to your door that is kind of neat.

744
00:52:10,988 --> 00:52:11,869
[SPEAKER_05]: A week later.

745
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:12,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

746
00:52:12,569 --> 00:52:13,090
[SPEAKER_03]: A week later.

747
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:19,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And every so often, Kinokuniya will clear them out, you know, a couple weeks after that for half price.

748
00:52:19,756 --> 00:52:20,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully something...

749
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Something coming to your door soon will be Mega Man 9.

750
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:33,401
[SPEAKER_05]: If this is to be believed, Capcom apparently has recently registered Mega Man 9 under Australia's version of the ESRB.

751
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:37,322
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the OFLC.

752
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:41,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the game is going to be multi-platform.

753
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:48,626
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could be pretty interesting, especially when you consider a couple weeks ago, didn't Capcom say something about reviving one of their dead franchises?

754
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:49,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Or there was going to be a couple?

755
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:52,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 9 Mega Man 8 Mega Man 9

756
00:53:10,037 --> 00:53:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want to see?

757
00:53:11,298 --> 00:53:11,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

758
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:19,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a redo of Mega Man 2 with the higher-end graphics, I think.

759
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:21,802
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it plays the same way.

760
00:53:21,842 --> 00:53:24,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was sort of that thing on GameCube, the anniversary condition.

761
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but...

762
00:53:25,894 --> 00:53:27,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I want shiny.

763
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:32,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I would like to see the Mega Man, you know, otaku geek in me would like to see.

764
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:42,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see them kind of do that, like what you're saying, but have the first like three Mega Man games all combined where you could go into the different stages.

765
00:53:42,644 --> 00:53:48,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, let's say you could go play in Bubble Man stage and then go to Top Man stage and then the Cuts Man stage.

766
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,169
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could kind of like all of them combined.

767
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:51,990
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new Rockman Power Battles.

768
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of cool.

769
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:54,913
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hot.

770
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:57,476
[SPEAKER_05]: AJ Mix calls it Mega Man 2 HD Remix.

771
00:53:58,577 --> 00:53:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

772
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on Xbox 360.

773
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

774
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:01,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

775
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:03,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like fun.

776
00:54:05,025 --> 00:54:05,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

777
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:06,667
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

778
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:11,032
[SPEAKER_03]: We should download extra stuff on Xbox 360 and include that in our letter.

779
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:13,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I already download a lot on Xbox 360.

780
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:15,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really nothing new.

781
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:21,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that thing set to automatically download all demos, which was a pretty brilliant idea.

782
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But Xbox can do that because the hard drives are huge.

783
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:24,682
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 20 gigs.

784
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:29,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need more space, there is a 120 gig hard drive available.

785
00:54:29,384 --> 00:54:29,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

786
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:31,625
[SPEAKER_05]: That 20 gigs has been more than enough.

787
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're industrious.

788
00:54:33,386 --> 00:54:35,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially after I deleted Final Fantasy XI.

789
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:37,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been more than enough space.

790
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:40,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really watch movies on it, but if I did, I could go get that $120.

791
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:45,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, you can put stuff on USB, memory card, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

792
00:54:47,736 --> 00:54:51,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft calls it kind of like the Sonic 2 HD version some guys are doing.

793
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, kind of.

794
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:56,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Canogram says, Sky, Mega Man Anniversary Collection for GameCube sucks.

795
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:57,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

796
00:54:57,424 --> 00:54:59,746
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the whole GameCube versus PS2.

797
00:54:59,786 --> 00:55:03,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the GameCube had the remix music, it screwed with the buttons and all of that.

798
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all right, fine, whatever.

799
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:05,630
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I meant.

800
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:07,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still excited about Mega Man 9.

801
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:11,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is actually pretty cool.

802
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:26,085
[SPEAKER_03]: But for people who like their video games turned into movies, like me, as long as they're not fucked up, there is some news about Onimusha and Clock Tower movies.

803
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:32,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, the Clock Tower movie still has Christoph Gans still attached to it, so that's pretty cool.

804
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:34,668
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool, because I like Silent Hill.

805
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:35,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I, for one, liked it.

806
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:45,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one's got a... I think actually that and Onimusha are set to come out in 2011.

807
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:49,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I take that back.

808
00:55:49,256 --> 00:55:55,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Onimusha will be out in 2011 and Clock Tower will be out next year.

809
00:55:56,322 --> 00:55:56,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

810
00:55:58,644 --> 00:55:59,965
[SPEAKER_03]: But it better not suck.

811
00:56:00,806 --> 00:56:01,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Go camp out now.

812
00:56:01,706 --> 00:56:02,867
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob?

813
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:03,248
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

814
00:56:03,648 --> 00:56:04,809
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a Fatal Frame movie.

815
00:56:07,918 --> 00:56:09,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want to see the Silent Hill 2 movie get made.

816
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know!

817
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It better not suck.

818
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:14,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they?

819
00:56:14,562 --> 00:56:14,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought.

820
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

821
00:56:15,843 --> 00:56:16,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

822
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:17,745
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

823
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:26,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a lot of stuff coming out this week in game releases in the US on PC.

824
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:28,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Political Machines 2008.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you too can now take part of your own I don't know political election.

826
00:56:36,752 --> 00:56:48,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week we've got the Spore Creature Creator for PC if you want to have a little piece of Spore to play until the actual game comes out.

827
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Although apparently if you know where to look you can already get it.

828
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:51,763
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the demo.

829
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:52,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear it's quite good.

830
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the demo.

831
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:56,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, I hear it's quite good.

832
00:56:57,427 --> 00:56:59,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it myself, but I hear it's good.

833
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:26,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week, Space Invaders Extreme on the PSP and DS Definitely worth checking out Finally, Imagine Rockstar on the DS Not quite as cool as Imagine Babies, but whatever Imagine Babies is still in my backpack Special in its own way Wacky Races, Crash and Dash Yes, that's based off of that really old cartoon series Does anyone still remember it?

834
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,920

[SPEAKER_04]: Code Lyoko, Fall of Izana Secret Agent Clank on the PSP Ubisoft's whoring yet another Pets franchise Pets Dogs Fashion That's right, dogs dressed up like things.

836
00:57:46,048 --> 00:57:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

837
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But not.

838
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop anthropomorphizing our animals.

839
00:57:52,912 --> 00:57:54,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Arkanoid on the DS.

840
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:55,414
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:57,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Tamagotchi Connection Corner 3

[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band Special Edition Guitar Hero On Tour Game Releases

843
00:58:20,127 --> 00:58:22,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much more upbeat over in Japan either.

844
00:58:22,648 --> 00:58:24,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a slow period for release dates in Japan.

845
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:30,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the Xbox 360 on June 19th, you can pick up Flat Out Ultimate Carnage if you want to get that.

846
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:33,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Because their releases tend to be on Fridays.

847
00:58:34,893 --> 00:58:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Over on the PlayStation 3, not a lot coming out this week.

848
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:40,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned for next week.

853
00:59:10,896 --> 00:59:15,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Love Drops and Odin Sphere get moved into the best, meaning they get price drops.

854
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:18,498

[SPEAKER_03]: MyPony!

857
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:20,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking that's a game they need to release over here a little quicker.

858
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:21,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is out over here, though.

859
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:26,080
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Sony PSP, God of War, Chains of Olympus comes out in Chinese.

860
01:00:26,781 --> 01:00:28,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It's localized for Chinese, so that's coming out this week.

861
01:00:28,782 --> 01:00:32,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not Japan, but Asia in general comes out of there.

[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't enough Super Robot Wars.

865
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:44,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really it.

866
01:00:44,857 --> 01:00:48,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the headset and remote come out for the PSP this week in Japan.

867
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:49,864
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

868
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the one of those that has the Ava's in it.

869
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,454
[SPEAKER_03]: The robot Tyson.

870
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was one of the Saturn ones.

871
01:00:59,048 --> 01:00:59,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

872
01:00:59,428 --> 01:01:00,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it my turn?

873
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:00,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It is your turn.

874
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:02,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We has games over in the UK.

875
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of them.

876
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:04,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a few of them.

877
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But on lots of systems.

878
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:10,514
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Alone in the Dark for Wii, PS2, PC, and Xbox 360.

879
01:01:11,514 --> 01:01:13,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 on PSP.

880
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:15,176
[SPEAKER_03]: About Time.

881
01:01:15,897 --> 01:01:17,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Gauntlet on DS.

882
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:18,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Gauntlet.

883
01:01:18,898 --> 01:01:25,221
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian on PSP, Xbox 360, DS, PS2, Wii, PC, PS3.

884
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And Top Spin on Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

885
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:32,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be confused with that really cool car show, Top Gear.

886
01:01:34,087 --> 01:01:42,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at Justin TV chat right now, which I don't usually watch during the show, but I know we have some people who can only watch on Justin TV because, for whatever reason, the other ways to listen to this are banned.

887
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:48,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Ikuma JP, who actually lives in Japan, pays me a compliment and says, I understand Sky's Japanese now.

888
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:49,890
[SPEAKER_05]: That is quite the compliment, actually.

889
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:50,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Never had a lesson.

890
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:58,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just saying, it really is, I guess with practice, you know, and I have noticed you picking up a little vocabulary.

891
01:01:59,491 --> 01:01:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: A little.

892
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:00,311
[SPEAKER_03]: A little.

893
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:01,312
[SPEAKER_05]: A little.

894
01:02:02,312 --> 01:02:02,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's picking up stuff.

895
01:02:03,012 --> 01:02:04,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty soon I'm going to start answering my phone.

896
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:04,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Mushy, mushy.

897
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:05,633
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

898
01:02:07,173 --> 01:02:08,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, AkumaJP brings up that whole difference.

899
01:02:09,074 --> 01:02:10,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Mega Man the same thing as Rockman?

900
01:02:10,914 --> 01:02:11,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

901
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:13,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockman is what it is in Japan and Europe.

902
01:02:13,975 --> 01:02:15,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they called it Mega Man here.

903
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking that maybe they thought if they called the game Rockman, people would have thought it was like a rock band or rock music.

904
01:02:21,557 --> 01:02:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

905
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:25,238
[SPEAKER_03]: The girl assistant was Roll.

906
01:02:26,707 --> 01:02:28,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, rock and roll.

907
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:36,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe is it because Guts Man was kind of a rock character and they didn't want people to think he was a bad guy?

908
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:37,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

909
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:39,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people don't get it.

910
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:41,560
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

911
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,383
[SPEAKER_05]: They did have a lot of those changes back in the day.

912
01:02:45,259 --> 01:02:45,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Random.

913
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:48,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And the really ugly cover that Mega Man 2 had.

914
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:50,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

915
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: This is when Capcom was like, let's Americanize all of the art.

916
01:02:53,963 --> 01:02:55,344
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty awesome cover.

917
01:02:55,764 --> 01:03:00,667
[SPEAKER_03]: The only, I think, good one that was done was one of the Metal Gear ones that looked like it had Michael Biehn on it.

918
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:03,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, Terminator.

919
01:03:03,604 --> 01:03:06,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Akuma, you've got to check that out if you've never seen it.

920
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:10,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Google Art and search for the Mega Man 2 box art because it's pretty epic.

921
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:14,238
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, if you live overseas and you've never seen it, it's pretty hilarious.

922
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:15,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Prepare to weep.

923
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:17,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hideous.

924
01:03:18,404 --> 01:03:19,565
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get back to some gaming news.

925
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:50,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're so close.

926
01:03:50,588 --> 01:03:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so close.

927
01:03:51,529 --> 01:03:51,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Warmer.

928
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:52,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting warmer.

929
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:53,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So close.

930
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:54,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You're warm.

931
01:03:54,471 --> 01:03:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the other one is, but we know what one of them is.

932
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Bionic Commando Rearmed.

933
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:08,602
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess considering that E3 is coming out mid-July, it'd probably be out before then.

934
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:13,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And Halo Wars was there, but Alan Wake was not.

935
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:38,674
[SPEAKER_04]: and the list is still very incomplete right now so there's you know no Atari, Codemasters, Crave, Disney, Eidos, Konami, LucasArts, MTV, Nintendo, Sega, Sony Online, Square Enix, Take-Two, Tecmo, THQ, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers Interactive so that's a big uh gap right there a big list but um

936
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:47,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm reading in chat about the whole Rockman vs. Mega Man thing, and GameGuru is saying Rocks is slang for crack.

937
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:50,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe that's why they didn't want to release it here.

938
01:04:50,445 --> 01:04:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people would have thought it was Crackman.

939
01:04:52,386 --> 01:04:56,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I don't know, if you release a game called Crackman, I think it might actually sell pretty well.

940
01:04:57,398 --> 01:04:58,239
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

941
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that Pac-Man overseas is called Puck-Man?

942
01:05:24,263 --> 01:05:24,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

943
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:25,484
[SPEAKER_05]: P-U-C-K-Man.

944
01:05:25,764 --> 01:05:27,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know why they didn't release that here?

945
01:05:27,805 --> 01:05:35,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they were afraid that people were going to take their magic markers and color over the P with an F. I swear to God, I read it on Wikipedia, therefore it's true.

946
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:37,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

947
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:37,771
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

948
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:39,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

949
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:39,712
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

950
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:41,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story.

951
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:41,973
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

952
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:44,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, we can do that.

953
01:05:44,705 --> 01:05:46,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, Jamie, this might be of interest to you.

954
01:05:46,787 --> 01:05:49,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever wanted to have a life-size Solid Snake statue?

955
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... Hey?

956
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:54,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

957
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, we ought to get one of these for the studio.

958
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of rad, actually.

959
01:05:58,661 --> 01:05:59,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking auction.

960
01:06:00,362 --> 01:06:01,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well here's the thing.

961
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:07,448
[SPEAKER_05]: What Sam's Club is doing, Sam's Club is actually selling a life-size statue of the old snake.

962
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:10,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's being sold starting this upcoming week.

963
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it's not something you can actually go into the store and buy.

964
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:15,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being auctioned.

965
01:06:16,394 --> 01:06:43,070
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's actually in a Walmart blog that originally announced this called Checkout I had no idea there were blogs about Walmart you learn new things every day you can find it on auctions.samsclub.com and if you search for Metal Gear Solid you can find the stand-up which I would love to have one of here in studio but somehow I don't think that's going to happen I'm going to guess that's probably going to go for a lot of money

966
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,007
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one thing I've ever won.

967
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the money going to charity or anything?

968
01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:48,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will be.

969
01:06:48,788 --> 01:06:51,309
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one thing I've ever won from a charity auction.

970
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:53,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to search for it and it says sold out.

971
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's up with that?

972
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it doesn't start until Monday or something.

973
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:03,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I've won one thing off of a charity auction for gaming related stuff.

974
01:07:03,612 --> 01:07:03,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

975
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:05,452
[SPEAKER_04]: True Crime New York City.

976
01:07:05,512 --> 01:07:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a poster signed by the entire cast.

977
01:07:09,614 --> 01:07:11,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at work though, framed.

978
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: True Crime, New York City

979
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:26,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

980
01:07:27,107 --> 01:07:29,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it, and it was cool.

981
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:32,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the poster that they had, the little teaser poster, before they announced that it was New York City.

982
01:07:33,089 --> 01:07:35,130
[SPEAKER_04]: You were supposed to guess, you know, what city it was.

983
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:36,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, right, right, yeah.

984
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this auction is not up until next week, but I'll tell you what, if it's a reasonable price, I might go put a bid on it.

985
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:43,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

986
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:45,994
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll probably get outbid pretty quick.

987
01:07:47,074 --> 01:07:47,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be fun.

988
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:50,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you like to have Solid Snake sitting in the corner of the studio?

989
01:07:50,535 --> 01:07:51,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Young Hot Snake.

990
01:07:53,196 --> 01:07:54,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Old Man Snake.

991
01:07:54,476 --> 01:07:55,817
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine, then I won't bid on it.

992
01:07:56,513 --> 01:08:04,836
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not going to appreciate the things I do for you... I'm not saying I wouldn't mind it, but now if it was, you know, if he had the camo mask, that'd be awesome.

993
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll figure something out.

994
01:08:06,156 --> 01:08:07,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I could put the Dr. Dick hat on him.

995
01:08:07,657 --> 01:08:08,517
[SPEAKER_05]: The little orange hat here.

996
01:08:08,777 --> 01:08:13,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if Justin TVers can see it because it's kind of blurry, but we could give that to Solid Snake.

997
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:14,479
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

998
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:15,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

999
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:44,380
[SPEAKER_03]: well something else that's sort of noteworthy is rumors going around that Sony was going to make an EPS3 controller that would break into two parts so that you could use it I guess like a Wiimote there was actually no real clear information given about it but what it actually turns out to be like I said rumor is that it was supposed to be a controller that has parts that will attach to it

1000
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,521
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1001
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:13,980
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Rob.

1002
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Hail Jamie.

1003
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:15,342
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Rob.

1004
01:09:15,462 --> 01:09:15,662
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1005
01:09:16,043 --> 01:09:17,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that you might think this is funny.

1006
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:20,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded the entire Vehicle Voltron series.

1007
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:21,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1008
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:22,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was awesome!

1009
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:25,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1010
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:26,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1011
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:27,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1012
01:09:28,894 --> 01:09:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: AVENGED SEVENFOLD, OFFSPRING, CROOKED X

1013
01:09:50,022 --> 01:09:55,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Acclaim by Avenged Sevenfold as well for 160 Microsoft Points, also $2.

1014
01:09:56,886 --> 01:10:01,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Hammerhead by The Offspring for 160 Microsoft Points, also $2.

1015
01:10:02,189 --> 01:10:08,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, Rock and Roll Dream by CrookedX for 80 Microsoft Points or $1.

1016
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:12,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what you're getting for Rock Band.

1017
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:13,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to...

1018
01:10:14,468 --> 01:10:19,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 3, Coldplay, Violet Hill, Yellow, and God Put a Smile on Your Face

1019
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: from the album A Rush of Blood to the Head.

1020
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:40,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I just don't think you could jam to The Scientist.

1021
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:43,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they kind of had to put these other songs on there.

1022
01:10:43,693 --> 01:10:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1023
01:10:44,233 --> 01:10:45,294
[SPEAKER_04]: At least have some guitar in them.

1024
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:51,455
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to bring you 500 Microsoft points or $6.25 via the PlayStation Network.

1025
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:52,976
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1026
01:10:54,036 --> 01:10:54,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I might actually check.

1027
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:55,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Coldplay.

1028
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:56,337
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty cool.

1029
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:57,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1030
01:10:57,597 --> 01:11:01,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think of myself as rocking out to them on Guitar Hero, but that could be interesting.

1031
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:05,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Coldplay's got some pretty guitar-heavy stuff.

1032
01:11:05,389 --> 01:11:08,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true, but maybe I think... Some fairly melodious guitar, I'd have to say.

1033
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:12,410
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite Coldplay stuff is their more slowed-down stuff, like The Scientist, Fix You.

1034
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I like all those really slow, whiny songs.

1035
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:15,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I like.

1036
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my favorite one they did is Talk.

1037
01:11:17,492 --> 01:11:17,772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1038
01:11:18,632 --> 01:11:19,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was a good song.

1039
01:11:19,632 --> 01:11:20,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really good song.

1040
01:11:20,272 --> 01:11:21,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my favorite one by them.

1041
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:21,532
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1042
01:11:22,413 --> 01:11:23,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, why isn't that in Guitar Hero?

1043
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be in Guitar Hero.

1044
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:25,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be.

1045
01:11:25,253 --> 01:11:26,294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1046
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:27,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe in Coldplay Pack 2.

1047
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:32,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Rock Band 2 is going to be featuring this band.

1048
01:11:33,008 --> 01:11:35,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never heard of this band in my entire life.

1049
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Their name is Turbo Negro?

1050
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:39,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the name of them?

1051
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:41,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know.

1052
01:11:41,153 --> 01:11:45,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This band apparently is going to be... I guess it's one of those cool... I mean, look at this guy.

1053
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:48,618
[SPEAKER_05]: He's wearing like a ginormous fur, like, train.

1054
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:50,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a bride would wear.

1055
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:53,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what impression I'm getting of them, Rob?

1056
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:53,421
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1057
01:11:53,802 --> 01:11:53,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Is...

1058
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:55,183
[SPEAKER_05]: The Village People.

1059
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:56,144
[SPEAKER_03]: The Village People, right.

1060
01:11:56,184 --> 01:11:59,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a sailor and you've got like the bride.

1061
01:11:59,467 --> 01:12:00,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never... You have the pimp.

1062
01:12:00,929 --> 01:12:02,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never heard... God, I feel old.

1063
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:05,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously have never heard of this band.

1064
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:06,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm so out of touch with youth.

1065
01:12:06,214 --> 01:12:06,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, don't feel bad.

1066
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:07,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither have I. All right, good.

1067
01:12:07,796 --> 01:12:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I see bad religion, so...

1068
01:12:09,898 --> 01:12:10,538
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, hold on.

1069
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:11,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get to that for a minute.

1070
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:23,403
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here's the thing is that when Age of Conan, you know, the big MMO, apparently they put out a press release here saying that, you know, because this band, I guess, is going to be doing the Age of Conan soundtrack.

1071
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:23,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1072
01:12:23,884 --> 01:12:25,564
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to be in Rock Band 2.

1073
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:33,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bad Religion is also supposedly supposed to be in the Rock Band sequel, even though Jamie gave that away.

1074
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:34,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry!

1075
01:12:34,568 --> 01:12:35,268
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was thanks to Twitter.

1076
01:12:38,086 --> 01:12:44,132
[SPEAKER_05]: The guitarist and songwriter from Bad Religion, Brett Gurewitz, said in his Twitter, he posted this twit.

1077
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:51,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven meetings and four executive decisions later, back at Sound City, putting the finishing touches on Sorrow for Rock Band 2.

1078
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised he was able to post that with Twitter being down as much as it's down.

1079
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:57,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they?

1080
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:58,646
[SPEAKER_05]: They better be Nordic death metal.

1081
01:12:58,666 --> 01:12:59,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

1082
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:01,508
[SPEAKER_05]: They are from Oslo, Norway.

1083
01:13:01,608 --> 01:13:02,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

1084
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: All of my friends are dead All of my friends are dead

1085
01:13:33,797 --> 01:13:34,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna download this right now.

1086
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:36,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie approves.

1087
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm downloading it.

1088
01:13:37,841 --> 01:13:38,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you go.

1089
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bad Religion does... Did I Love My Computer?

1090
01:13:42,305 --> 01:13:46,088
[SPEAKER_04]: That would work well with like a Grand Theft Auto 4 video that I could possibly film.

1091
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:55,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we like playing this game during lunch where we put friendly fire off and then we fire rockets at each other so we get rocket jumped.

1092
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun.

1093
01:13:57,618 --> 01:13:59,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenocor says it's Nordic Punk, not death metal.

1094
01:14:01,298 --> 01:14:03,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's that song by Bad Religion, by the way, in case you were wondering.

1095
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, thankfully, I have heard of Bad Religion.

1096
01:14:18,424 --> 01:14:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an album called Apocalypse Dudes.

1097
01:14:21,245 --> 01:14:21,825
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1098
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:28,816
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Dragonforce supposedly has a new album out in August.

1099
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:30,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep an eye out for that.

1100
01:14:30,356 --> 01:14:31,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

1101
01:14:31,557 --> 01:14:32,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Your rock band update.

1102
01:14:33,438 --> 01:14:37,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the segment where the old hosts of OLR learn about new bands that kids are into.

1103
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:38,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I just downloaded it.

1104
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:40,140
[SPEAKER_03]: That song that you played.

1105
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my computer is great, so shut up.

1106
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway.

1107
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:45,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1108
01:14:45,942 --> 01:14:47,643
[SPEAKER_05]: You downloaded that on your iPhone, didn't you?

1109
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:48,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Just now.

1110
01:14:48,244 --> 01:14:53,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask, what did you think about the iPhone announcements on Monday about the new sleeker, cheaper one?

1111
01:14:54,685 --> 01:14:55,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1112
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:58,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... I didn't want a GPS.

1113
01:14:59,306 --> 01:15:02,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And I already have an 8GB iPhone.

1114
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:05,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can just update my OS on it.

1115
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:07,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't care.

1116
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:07,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna get one.

1117
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:08,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one.

1118
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:12,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I already wanted an iPhone, and that just kind of upped the ante a little bit.

1119
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the... And then... I have to ask kids.

1120
01:15:15,629 --> 01:15:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did you think of the iPhone announcements that happened on Monday?

1121
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:23,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really care, because it said, well, the slim thing, it's slim around the edges, but it's actually thicker.

1122
01:15:25,553 --> 01:15:39,553
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently it's going to have that new finish on the outside either white or black which is supposed to be really easy to scratch instead of how they already had it perfect where it wouldn't scratch that easy and also there's supposed to be a bunch of hidden fees

1123
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:40,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome!

1124
01:15:41,071 --> 01:15:42,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a phone for me.

1125
01:15:42,592 --> 01:15:44,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Really expensive and filled with fees.

1126
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:50,339
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that was the other thing, is that if they're going to be cutting costs in one way, they're going to try to get it from you another way.

1127
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:52,821
[SPEAKER_05]: They upped the price of the plan, is what they did.

1128
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:54,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something like that.

1129
01:15:54,482 --> 01:16:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sitting here with my, you know, I paid $400 for my iPhone, sure, but this thing has fucking lasted me, and it's fallen from my pocket and landed on the floor and lived.

1130
01:16:06,253 --> 01:16:07,233
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll see you next time.

1131
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:22,467
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1132
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:28,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Joshi16 comments on the last story saying, You know, Sky, cool kids listen to Ashley Simpson, so you should too.

1133
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Now look, I'm not that old.

1134
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:33,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I know no one listens to Ashley Simpson, okay?

1135
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what was cool with her.

1136
01:16:34,416 --> 01:16:34,596
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1137
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:37,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Her interview on the Charlotte Church show.

1138
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:39,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten to be where I like that show.

1139
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I still can't get over that Charlotte Church had like a hip talk show overseas.

1140
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:44,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny.

1141
01:16:44,944 --> 01:16:45,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1142
01:16:45,464 --> 01:16:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: She's fucking Charlotte Church.

1143
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:48,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's hilarious.

1144
01:16:48,086 --> 01:16:49,988
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the 11-year-old girl that's saying, What?

1145
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:52,770
[SPEAKER_03]: She's freaking hilarious.

1146
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,470
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you should watch the... Okay, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1147
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch the... Go on YouTube later and watch the interview.

1148
01:16:58,253 --> 01:16:59,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen clips of the Charlotte Church show.

1149
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you watch the interview with John Barrowman?

1150
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:02,175
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1151
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:03,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch that.

1152
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:04,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will.

1153
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:08,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's seriously, you know, a boy and his hag.

1154
01:17:08,799 --> 01:17:10,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the whole conversation.

1155
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,042
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their whole conversation.

1156
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1157
01:17:16,234 --> 01:17:17,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that show still producing?

1158
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:22,592
[SPEAKER_03]: She put it on hiatus after she had her baby, but was talking about bringing it back up.

1159
01:17:23,237 --> 01:17:28,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading an interview where she wanted to get Paris Hilton on the show so she could make fun of her.

1160
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:28,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1161
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I thought that'd be funny.

1162
01:17:53,223 --> 01:17:55,104
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gone, let's see, what have we talked about tonight?

1163
01:17:55,124 --> 01:17:57,546
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about D&D, we talked about international TV.

1164
01:17:59,428 --> 01:18:02,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You know something is wrong with OLR when we're talking about Charlotte Church's life.

1165
01:18:03,371 --> 01:18:05,032
[SPEAKER_03]: But her show's funny.

1166
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:06,513
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, talk about video games, Jamie.

1167
01:18:07,254 --> 01:18:07,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-uh.

1168
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:08,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1169
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:09,095
[SPEAKER_03]: The Agency.

1170
01:18:09,675 --> 01:18:11,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there we go, warmer.

1171
01:18:11,597 --> 01:18:15,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to have the thing, the word that I hate, that I will not use.

1172
01:18:16,403 --> 01:18:24,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not going to have the arbitrary transactions that occur within the game that some people have used the term micro as a prefix to.

1173
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:25,450
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

1174
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:26,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Micro machines?

1175
01:18:27,612 --> 01:18:27,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1176
01:18:29,514 --> 01:18:34,438
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not going to be using an arbitrary transition system within the agency.

1177
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:42,625
[SPEAKER_03]: They are actually going to have an in-game currency that you will use like a lot of MMOs have in an auction house.

1178
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:44,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like a microtransaction.

1179
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:50,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You will not be using actual currency to purchase your money in-game.

1180
01:18:53,107 --> 01:18:55,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be using the in-game currency that you use.

1181
01:18:56,669 --> 01:18:59,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like buying your weapons in Metal Gear Solid 4.

1182
01:19:02,312 --> 01:19:05,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is not an arbitrary transaction because it's no money out of your pocket.

1183
01:19:06,806 --> 01:19:07,106
[SPEAKER_01]: He died.

1184
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:10,229
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because he figured out that in your life, you can only say so many words before you die.

1185
01:19:10,249 --> 01:19:10,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And well...

1186
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:32,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he just blew through those real quick.

1187
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You are horrible.

1188
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:34,832
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

1189
01:19:35,552 --> 01:19:40,754
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually, I very, very much like him, though, because he was also Blur in Transformers, the movie.

1190
01:19:40,854 --> 01:19:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also the Scatman.

1191
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:46,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that the same guy?

1192
01:19:46,256 --> 01:19:46,356
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1193
01:19:46,456 --> 01:19:46,636
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1194
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:48,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was the same guy.

1195
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:48,696
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1196
01:19:50,677 --> 01:19:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I always thought Scatman and the Microchips guy were the same fucking guy.

1197
01:19:53,598 --> 01:19:55,238
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Scatman Crothers was Hong Kong Philly.

1198
01:19:55,979 --> 01:19:56,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they did both die.

1199
01:19:57,423 --> 01:19:58,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that's sad.

1200
01:19:58,164 --> 01:19:58,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sad.

1201
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Loki's on to something.

1202
01:20:02,051 --> 01:20:03,574
[SPEAKER_03]: As I was saying... Alright, sorry.

1203
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We're screwed too then.

1204
01:20:08,257 --> 01:20:35,255
[SPEAKER_03]: the live gamer system is going to be used basically to set up like it is in EverQuest 2 where they use Golden Game as a transaction but they said that they were planning on using alternate mechanics to use outside of in-game play I guess for purchasing things that go along with it but not necessarily as an integral part of the gameplay

1205
01:20:35,609 --> 01:20:46,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you're gonna call you on your cell phone and shit, too, in this game, like, tell you, hey, Bob's, you know, been kidnapped, do you want to, you know, Do you give a shit?

1206
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:47,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to pay the ransom?

1207
01:20:48,073 --> 01:20:48,273
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1208
01:20:48,353 --> 01:20:50,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, fucking stop calling me at work!

1209
01:20:51,674 --> 01:20:53,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not playing you anymore!

1210
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:54,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1211
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, technology.

1212
01:20:57,456 --> 01:20:58,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love it.

1213
01:21:00,517 --> 01:21:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of technology, though, Whatever.

1214
01:21:03,278 --> 01:21:04,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Not you, not you, Bob.

1215
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:05,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

1216
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:06,750
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1217
01:21:07,671 --> 01:21:13,417
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Rob just looks over here and he has this amused expression and I'm like, whatever.

1218
01:21:14,258 --> 01:21:15,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm funny.

1219
01:21:16,841 --> 01:21:18,683
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a fun guy like a fungus.

1220
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:21,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story.

1221
01:21:21,587 --> 01:21:30,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so speaking of technology, Capcom is offering fans of the Street Fighter series to get their face into the game.

1222
01:21:31,073 --> 01:21:41,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to Capcom's Unity blog, they posted a call for fans to submit their story and why they should be in Street Fighter 4.

1223
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:47,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send them anything from a new belly dancing telegram to something a little bit more elaborate.

1224
01:21:47,924 --> 01:21:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Just you have to send it by June 18th.

1225
01:21:52,268 --> 01:21:53,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Better get started.

1226
01:21:53,389 --> 01:21:53,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1227
01:21:54,430 --> 01:22:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And you email your submissions to contest at capcom.com along with your name, phone number, age, and email address.

1228
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, are you going to get your face in Street Fighter 4?

1229
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:07,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really care.

1230
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:08,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should.

1231
01:22:09,144 --> 01:22:09,304
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1232
01:22:09,464 --> 01:22:10,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Will someone else send in Loki's face?

1233
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:11,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Say it's theirs?

1234
01:22:14,232 --> 01:22:15,433
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'd like to see happen.

1235
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:22,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever these companies have these contests for Get Your Face in the Game, I want to see people just send in Loki's picture.

1236
01:22:23,557 --> 01:22:26,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I know which picture they'll send, and that's not going to work.

1237
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:29,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1238
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:31,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I will sue them.

1239
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:35,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another game I'd like to see Loki in.

1240
01:22:35,424 --> 01:22:37,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rose and Camellia.

1241
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:38,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever heard of this game?

1242
01:22:38,786 --> 01:22:39,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the slapping game.

1243
01:22:39,827 --> 01:22:41,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's the slap a woman game.

1244
01:22:41,568 --> 01:22:44,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've seen this.

1245
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not domestic violence or any of that stuff that's not cool.

1246
01:22:47,852 --> 01:22:57,439
[SPEAKER_05]: This is that old ladies in big floofy dresses taking their white gloves off and slapping the other woman in a dramatic soap opera fashion.

1247
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:00,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have remembered this game from a couple months ago.

1248
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:01,201
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Flash game.

1249
01:23:01,401 --> 01:23:02,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1250
01:23:02,782 --> 01:23:06,004
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have it on the DS via homebrew too, Jamie.

1251
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1252
01:23:06,804 --> 01:23:11,247
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a brand new sequel to Rose and Camellia.

1253
01:23:11,307 --> 01:23:12,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rose and Camellia 2.

1254
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:14,609
[SPEAKER_05]: All new women to slap.

1255
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:16,070
[SPEAKER_05]: All new stages.

1256
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:19,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all the things you loved about the first game, but more.

1257
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:21,873
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I have to retract my statement.

1258
01:23:22,053 --> 01:23:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1259
01:23:22,453 --> 01:23:23,194
[SPEAKER_03]: John Machida Jr.

1260
01:23:23,234 --> 01:23:23,594
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't dead.

1261
01:23:26,176 --> 01:23:27,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the guy who did the Microchips?

1262
01:23:28,257 --> 01:23:30,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So you must have thought he was Scatman John 2 subconsciously.

1263
01:23:31,018 --> 01:23:31,859
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's Scatman Crothers.

1264
01:23:32,794 --> 01:23:34,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, whatever.

1265
01:23:35,315 --> 01:23:35,655
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1266
01:23:38,696 --> 01:23:40,317
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

1267
01:23:40,477 --> 01:23:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: People report that celebrities are dead all the time.

1268
01:23:43,078 --> 01:23:45,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, here's the thing though.

1269
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:48,020
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot just get the sequel that easy.

1270
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:53,862
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to actually beat the original Rose and Camellia to get the sequel.

1271
01:23:56,043 --> 01:23:58,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think the first game was that hard from what I remember.

1272
01:23:58,864 --> 01:23:59,364
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's there.

1273
01:24:00,925 --> 01:24:01,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1274
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:04,499
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is this week's classic game of the week?

1275
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I went for Obscure, as in Obscure System.

1276
01:24:31,742 --> 01:24:34,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game that came out on the 32X.

1277
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:36,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Have I done 32X games before?

1278
01:24:36,424 --> 01:24:37,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've had a 32X game yet.

1279
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I might have done... I haven't done Space Harrier, have I?

1280
01:24:41,927 --> 01:24:42,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to my knowledge.

1281
01:24:42,487 --> 01:24:43,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not doing Space Harrier today.

1282
01:24:44,509 --> 01:24:46,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing Knuckles Chaotix.

1283
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Knuckles Chaotix is cool.

1284
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:51,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue that beautiful bean footage.

1285
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:52,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying.

1286
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:53,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take me a minute.

1287
01:24:53,475 --> 01:24:54,815
[SPEAKER_05]: The YouTube-y is buffering.

1288
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:57,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us a little bit about Knuckles Chaotix.

1289
01:24:57,456 --> 01:25:00,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Knuckles Chaotix in Japan was called just Chaotix.

1290
01:25:01,058 --> 01:25:07,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does feature Knuckles and a bunch of his buddies hanging out on a different island.

1291
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:08,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And Knuckles is...

1292
01:25:11,636 --> 01:25:11,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1293
01:25:12,336 --> 01:25:13,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1294
01:25:13,797 --> 01:25:17,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, you actually have different buddies that go along with you.

1295
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:19,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a buddy system game where you're joined by rings.

1296
01:25:20,259 --> 01:25:22,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And a band joins the rings together.

1297
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, say that you are using Knuckles as your main guy.

1298
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:32,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Knuckles will be able to climb up walls and float across.

1299
01:25:34,443 --> 01:25:35,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually use...

1300
01:25:37,938 --> 01:25:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that SPO does some type of drill move or something.

1301
01:25:41,941 --> 01:25:47,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole point of the game is to use a spuddy system to make it through the five different worlds in the game.

1302
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:48,666
[SPEAKER_03]: They're called attractions.

1303
01:25:49,306 --> 01:25:56,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, get to the end and kick MechaSonic's ass and tell Eggman he can piss off.

1304
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the characters in the game actually did make it into Sonic Heroes.

1305
01:26:02,276 --> 01:26:04,758
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be SPO, Vector, and Charmy.

1306
01:26:06,379 --> 01:26:06,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1307
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the other thing about this game is that it's one of the first to have, at least on the 32X, I think they had a battery backup on its own, which would save your game and you could go back to it at any time.

1308
01:26:27,427 --> 01:26:31,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just, and I'm sure you're watching the gameplay right now, right?

1309
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:39,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and to be honest, since I never had a 32X or a Sega Genesis, I mean, sure, I played Sonic the Hedgehog at my friend's house, but I never really played this game, like, ever.

1310
01:26:39,824 --> 01:26:45,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks a lot like regular Sonic, but with a little bit of this buddy action kind of going on.

1311
01:26:45,187 --> 01:26:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the other thing about that is that you do... You've also got your bonus stages and special stages.

1312
01:26:50,409 --> 01:26:54,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Your bonus stage, you collect 20 more rings by jumping through large rings that are hidden in the level.

1313
01:26:54,871 --> 01:26:57,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got spiral free falls and that sort of thing.

1314
01:26:58,173 --> 01:26:58,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also...

1315
01:27:00,294 --> 01:27:01,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1316
01:27:18,018 --> 01:27:19,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say that they were.

1317
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:20,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me on that quite yet.

1318
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:35,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Also now, for the people who were into the really, really obscure, there was something that came out on the Genesis emulators back in the day that was called Sonic Crackers.

1319
01:27:36,146 --> 01:27:37,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever remember this, Rob?

1320
01:27:38,868 --> 01:27:39,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.

1321
01:27:40,097 --> 01:27:48,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Crackers, which had also been titled the Sonic Stadium in Sonic the Hedgehog 4, was a game featuring Sonic and Tails linked by rings.

1322
01:27:49,687 --> 01:28:00,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And the very interesting thing about this is that it was pretty much officially called the prototype for Knuckles Chaotix.

1323
01:28:01,418 --> 01:28:09,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Proven by the fact that in one of the early Chaotix builds, actually the December 7, 1994 build, the same sprites for Sonic and Tails were found.

1324
01:28:09,801 --> 01:28:17,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Although my personal theory is that Sonic and Tails were just used, because it's their Sonic 1 sprites, were used for developmental purposes, to build the engine.

1325
01:28:18,123 --> 01:28:25,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's levels that actually cross over that have big similarities to levels that were in Chaotix.

1326
01:28:26,386 --> 01:28:28,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's very, very interesting.

1327
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really, you know, half the game.

1328
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:34,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You get through with repeating levels and lots of deterioration in the data.

1329
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:42,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, there's, uh, actually Amy Rose is in the sound test on Knuckles Chaotix.

1330
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:46,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's actually a way to, on certain copies of it, to switch out...

1331
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:54,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember which of the characters it is, but you can do a code that switches out one of the characters for Sonic for that same sprite.

1332
01:28:54,874 --> 01:28:55,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1333
01:28:56,435 --> 01:29:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also some of the level music in here.

1334
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:05,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Different versions of the same music was heard in Sonic Crackers.

1335
01:29:05,781 --> 01:29:10,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, one of the Chaotix builds was labeled as Sonic Crackers 32X.

1336
01:29:14,326 --> 01:29:14,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1337
01:29:15,066 --> 01:29:15,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had a...

1338
01:29:18,134 --> 01:29:18,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks interesting.

1339
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:22,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those Sonic games I never really got the chance to play, so hopefully it'll come out.

1340
01:29:22,998 --> 01:29:25,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know GameTap's been adding 32X games.

1341
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:27,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's on there, and I just haven't noticed it.

1342
01:29:27,262 --> 01:29:28,083
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be on there.

1343
01:29:28,123 --> 01:29:29,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I love these stages.

1344
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:31,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but this is a bonus stage we're looking at right now in the studio.

1345
01:29:31,985 --> 01:29:34,185
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a special stage, the Hexagon 3D one.

1346
01:29:34,405 --> 01:29:34,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

1347
01:29:35,285 --> 01:29:47,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it's something that you might think is cool, is that the stage setup for this actually made its way into Sonic Advance, something similar to this.

1348
01:29:48,548 --> 01:29:51,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the bonus stage one that made it into Sonic Advance.

1349
01:29:53,749 --> 01:29:55,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you have it.

1350
01:29:56,178 --> 01:29:58,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Knuckles Chaotix, your classic game of the week.

1351
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out on the Sega 32X if you actually have one.

1352
01:30:02,682 --> 01:30:03,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I have like two.

1353
01:30:04,585 --> 01:30:05,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to send one to one of our listeners?

1354
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:07,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask.

1355
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:11,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for this part A of our Orange Lounge Radio.

1356
01:30:11,429 --> 01:30:13,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been running awfully long here, almost like an hour and a half into it.

1357
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:14,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take a break.

1358
01:30:14,732 --> 01:30:18,414
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1359
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:23,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1360
01:30:24,438 --> 01:30:28,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
