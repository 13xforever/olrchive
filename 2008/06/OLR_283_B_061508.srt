00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:05,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:14,721
[SPEAKER_12]: To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:19,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:29,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio here on All Games Radio where we broadcast live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.

5
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:32,778
[SPEAKER_15]: So sometimes it's a couple minutes early, sometimes it's a couple minutes late as it was tonight.

6
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:36,939
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's alright because we have some great shows that we play with here on All Games Radio.

7
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Not just Bobby on Sunday nights but a whole sort of assortment of different podcasts and other live shows that air throughout the week.

8
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,161
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you haven't checked it out yet you definitely should.

9
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,002
[SPEAKER_15]: www.allgames.com Meanwhile

10
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:50,423
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got some other gaming news to get into, and we're going to get into that in just a minute.

11
00:00:50,443 --> 00:01:00,766
[SPEAKER_15]: But we've got to follow up with some of that hilarity from the Part A. Or I guess I shouldn't say hilarity, because somebody is going to get yelled at over all those game news things getting leaked out.

12
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:03,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you were doing some poking around on the website.

13
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,388
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of stuff were you looking at there during the break?

14
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:08,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was just trying to pull up a bunch of... What's the name of these guys again?

15
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Intellisponse?

16
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Intellisponse.

17
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:23,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny though because there was a section on the NeoGAF forum that someone had highlighted their privacy policy.

18
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:25,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the policy.

19
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:29,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority.

20
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We have taken careful measures to secure your information.

21
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from PC to our servers.

22
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:47,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Our secure server software encrypts information, ensuring that all internet transactions remain private.

23
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be so embarrassing, though.

24
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,327
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be so embarrassing.

25
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:52,268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so stupid.

26
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:57,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is secure, and it will prompt for a password and stuff like that.

27
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But, if you remove part of the URL on that, it won't.

28
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:06,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's broken.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, somebody's going to get screamed at.

30
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff, and we'll talk about it a little bit more later on.

31
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:15,767
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be curious to see if this company makes a statement, or if they just try to pretend it didn't happen.

32
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:20,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just going to pretend it didn't happen, and let Microsoft and Activision kind of

33
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the other marketing research companies today are going, Woohoo!

34
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:26,275
[SPEAKER_15]: New business is going to be coming soon.

35
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:26,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

36
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:27,096
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's stop kicking sand in these guys' faces and go back to gaming news.

38
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

39
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:33,401
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

40
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:38,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some interesting things coming out this week in Japan.

41
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what you'd call this press event, but it was basically the event where Microsoft says, Hey, look at all the Japanese RPGs that are coming our way.

42
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:46,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

43
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,619
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:18,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess apparently the game was announced back in 2007 at the Square Enix party.

45
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,046
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I don't know.

46
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:24,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny too because originally it was supposed to be a PS3 exclusive.

47
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:29,869
[SPEAKER_02]: But no word yet on when it's going to arrive on the PS3 or if it will.

48
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Tales of Vesperia Tales of Vesperia

49
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it coming out of the U.S.

50
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,033
[SPEAKER_15]: at the same time?

51
00:03:59,133 --> 00:03:59,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the same time.

52
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:01,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the same time, but we don't have it.

53
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:02,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll also be mid-August.

54
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really?

55
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:04,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

56
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:04,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So far.

57
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,685
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't part of this press release.

58
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know something I don't?

59
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's coming out mid-August.

60
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the exact date, but it's coming out mid-August.

61
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:14,913
[SPEAKER_15]: It still looks pretty cool.

62
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:19,456
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a Namco Bandai RPG, which I believe Eternal Sonata was by them as well.

63
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:24,440
[SPEAKER_15]: That game was kind of one of those games that slipped under some people's radars, but it's great.

64
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:25,801
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great game.

65
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,223
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping this game follows in that.

66
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:29,664
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be 37,800 yen for the bundle.

67
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:42,769
[SPEAKER_15]: because the game is actually going to get its own Xbox 360 bundle over in Japan to try and tap into that market that just won't pick up on Xbox 360.

68
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:52,991
[SPEAKER_15]: The Japanese are really resistant to Xbox 360, but trying to use some of these upcoming role-playing games, which all look pretty rad, to try and woo some of the Japanese players over to Xbox 360.

69
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,131
[SPEAKER_15]: It hasn't worked so far.

70
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:59,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have a feeling they're all too busy playing Metal Gear Solid 4 to care this week.

71
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:00,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry to say.

72
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:01,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll buy it.

73
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:32,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Another game that Squenix published is actually developed by TriAce for Xbox 360 Infinite Undiscovery has ship dates for North America and Europe being 9.2 and 9.5 respectively and proposed in-store dates of September 11th for Japan and Asia You can read about it if you read Japanese on Famitsu

74
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,532
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, this was like my favorite out of all those role-playing games I saw, this Infinite Undiscovery.

75
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,413
[SPEAKER_15]: This was pretty sweet.

76
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,755
[SPEAKER_09]: The name is very interesting.

77
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,616
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really weird that we're getting it before Japan.

78
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It's shipping on that day.

79
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:50,219
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still going to be there the next day.

80
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:59,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll still be able to walk into a store and get it before a Japanese listener or person, which is strange, because with role-playing games, I can't think of many times that happens.

81
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

82
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:02,565
[SPEAKER_15]: So, but that's, I mean, it's not that much.

83
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:03,305
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only like a week.

84
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:07,367
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think it's pretty cool they at least obviously developed the games at the same time.

85
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:07,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

86
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:08,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty neat.

87
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:16,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last game, of course, which we've seen a little bit of trailers on, I think during E3, and maybe the Tokyo Game Show, I don't remember.

88
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:22,074
[SPEAKER_02]: But the last title, of course, The Last Remnant, will be getting an Xbox 360 release.

89
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:26,416
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that's using the Unreal 3 engine that I'm...

90
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,483
[SPEAKER_02]: was first announced in 2007.

91
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:43,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game is supposed to be, I guess, supposed to be launching simultaneously on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan, North America, and Europe, I guess, a little bit later.

92
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:51,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it looks like they're going to get a simultaneous worldwide launch in all three territories.

93
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's supposed to come sometime this winter.

94
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:57,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

95
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,775
[SPEAKER_15]: So coming soon is basically what they've said.

96
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,035
[SPEAKER_15]: The fall.

97
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:07,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I'm actually curious, because I know a lot of our listeners are into these RPG-type games, because we are.

98
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:23,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of curious, chat room, out of these games we just talked about, Star Ocean, Tales of Vesperia, Infinite Undiscovery, Last Remnant, is there any that, and kind of including other RPGs we know are in the tailpipe for Xbox 360, such as Blue Dragon 2, I think's been confirmed, as well as the Lost Odyssey sequel.

99
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:28,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of curious, those of you guys in chat, are any of these catching your interest?

100
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:33,059
[SPEAKER_15]: And if so, which one and why?

101
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Which one do you think you're more interested in over the others?

102
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:39,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have Infinite Undiscovery on order, same with Tales.

103
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:46,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also the PS3 Sega one that's coming out that I can't remember the name off the top of my head right now.

104
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one I also have on order.

105
00:07:49,936 --> 00:08:16,814
[SPEAKER_15]: chat.orangelongeradio.com if you want to join in on the instant discussion there if you're listening live to us on this Sunday evening as well as five copies of Saints Row 2 for each one of our Xbox 360s nice we'll move you asked a question of us oh I was asking chat but certainly if you have an opinion too please I'm sort of thinking that Infinite Undiscovery but it depends on if I have time

106
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:18,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Always depends on time.

107
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:19,704
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

108
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,825
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go back to that question in just a minute.

109
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me address this, though, related to Xbox stories.

110
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:32,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, the Xbox Live Arcade game with the longest freaking title ever.

111
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:40,249
[SPEAKER_15]: You know it's going into beta, and the beta was purchased through Commando 3, which just went on Xbox Live Arcade this past week.

112
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,050
[SPEAKER_15]: That beta is going to open up on June 25th.

113
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,491
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be next Wednesday.

114
00:08:47,171 --> 00:09:02,918
[SPEAKER_15]: is when this beta is going to go live now remember about the beta though you only basically get Ken Ryu in one stage so it's not really a whole lot to the game but hey at least you do get to take a peek at what this game is going to look like so again that all starts on June 25th

115
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:09,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Going to the question that I asked earlier, looking in chat at some of the answers here.

116
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:10,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

117
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Joshi16 says, I don't have the time anymore.

118
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:14,829
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to try Eternal Sonata.

119
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:15,709
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so behind.

120
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm behind on a lot of these games too.

121
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:19,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn wow.

122
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,632
[SPEAKER_15]: GameGuru says, OLR, not really.

123
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:26,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the Blue Dragon games because Blue Dragon is from Team Chrono Trigger.

124
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:32,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to tell you though, the first Blue Dragon game, not what you would have hoped for.

125
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,033
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

126
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine a Super Nintendo classic RPG on an Xbox 360.

127
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,497
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of what Blue Dragon was.

128
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:45,679
[SPEAKER_15]: But unfortunately the story was a little generic as a lot of RPGs tended to be back then.

129
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

130
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

131
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:50,742
[SPEAKER_15]: That was really it.

132
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:52,863
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't get a whole lot of comments on that in chat.

133
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:54,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Osfer says he wants to get Eternal Sonata for PS3.

134
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:56,905
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess they do have the extra stuff.

135
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:57,445
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll see.

136
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:00,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I hadn't looked at this.

137
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:03,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wish I hadn't looked at this.

138
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:04,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what's that?

139
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to spoil it for anybody else.

140
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,203
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, this really isn't that bad of a spoiler.

141
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:13,325
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm still not going to say anything about it.

142
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:20,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there is a voice acting casting callout for a second Portal game.

143
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say anything about it.

144
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:27,419
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't know what it is or why, it's just out there.

145
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I know why, I know what it is now.

146
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,001
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's a spoilery.

147
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:31,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't want to spoil it for anybody.

148
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:40,450
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to know, you can actually hunt it down on... I hate most gaming blogs around the story this week.

149
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,531
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not going to ruin it.

150
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta say though that the premise sounds awesome.

151
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:50,311
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I read of it, it sounds very interesting.

152
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,252
[SPEAKER_15]: You knew it was coming.

153
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:52,973
[SPEAKER_15]: You knew a Portal 2 had to happen somehow.

154
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:56,517
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm glad they will make it work one way or the other.

155
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:57,938
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

156
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,780
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

157
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,700
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

158
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:25,739
[SPEAKER_02]: was a new map for Halo 3 called Cold Storage.

159
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:36,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Cold Storage is, is actually a remake, or I guess a map that resembles the Chill Out level from the first Halo game.

160
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:44,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's kind of interesting, it kind of falls in line with, you know, the other maps that have been released, kind of a lot of remakes, and that...

161
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:49,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, inspired by previous game maps and stuff like that.

162
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:54,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no word on when this will be coming to us, but probably something like in the fall or summer.

163
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, another map pack.

164
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,440
[SPEAKER_15]: But pretty cool.

165
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:00,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

166
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds interesting.

167
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:05,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I'm kind of over Halo 3.

168
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:08,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about the rest of y'all.

169
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:11,085
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't have the lasting power that Halo 2 did, sadly.

170
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,419
[SPEAKER_15]: The Maw is a new game that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

171
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:24,761
[SPEAKER_15]: The first time I look at this and I see this little creature in a little screenshot from The Maw, I think it's something I see out of Spore or something.

172
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:33,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, what Maw is, is that is kind of the little mouth creature on a pet blob that is featured in the game.

173
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:38,305
[SPEAKER_15]: You can actually use this little creature to eat a house or...

174
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

175
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:11,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Twisted Pixel is the people behind the game and they promise that they will have a lengthy single player mode, cut scenes that are described as intense and cutting edge graphics for Xbox Live Arcade.

176
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:13,365
[SPEAKER_15]: No word on when this will be out.

177
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:15,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully a little sooner than Castle Crashers.

178
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,471
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

179
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, let's take a look at what you guys have to say in our mailbag.

180
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:29,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Every week we open up our mailbag to you guys to send us your emails and your love and adoration or your hate mail.

181
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

182
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:35,384
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura's going to dive in right now, pick a few of her favorites, read them for you.

183
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,805
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a bunch of them, but they're not that long.

184
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

185
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: First one comes from...

186
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:44,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to say James.

187
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:48,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a date on how long Deoxys is available?

188
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:54,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in Germany and my cartridge is in Texas to get the event item for Darkrai.

189
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So I may need to ask someone to take the cartridge to GameStop.

190
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:00,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see.

191
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:02,363
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember seeing one either.

192
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:03,565
[SPEAKER_15]: I will try to find the answer.

193
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,310
[SPEAKER_15]: You may have to get a friend over here to get it for you or something somehow.

194
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:13,283
[SPEAKER_09]: This one comes from our friend in Kenya.

195
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, OR, I've been listening to tonight's show and I'm thrilled you read my email.

196
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, no, this guy's fake.

197
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:20,047
[SPEAKER_15]: I proved it.

198
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,028
[SPEAKER_15]: He's on our Facebook community.

199
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:30,703
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure how I'm supposed to prove who I am, but I will try and find a way to get a hold of the camera to take a picture of Samara's Cafe.

200
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:31,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

201
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,545
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in the USA from Kenya, and that's from Taiwan.

202
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,930
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to know, what the hell is this?

203
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Just come clean, I caught you.

204
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,474
[SPEAKER_15]: The name in your email is in our Facebook community.

205
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:57,636
[SPEAKER_15]: You got caught.

206
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:58,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Now admit it.

207
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, next email.

208
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:02,519
[SPEAKER_15]: But I still want to see the picture.

209
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of want to see what you were going to do.

210
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,203
[SPEAKER_09]: This one comes from the guy with the cool email.

211
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:11,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Saltech.

212
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:19,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wondering if any of you know whether Sony ever plans to let you play PSP games using your PS3 via remote play.

213
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:23,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate the PSP's control, but it seems all the games I like are coming out for it, i.e.

214
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:26,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Kingdom Hearts 3, God of War 3, Final Fantasy 7.

215
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:40,182
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like it would be smart because it would only take an update to do, and I know personally that a few of my friends would pick up both the PS3 and PSP just to do this, and the others, since they already have a PS3, would just buy the PS3.

216
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:41,863
[SPEAKER_15]: He means Crisis Core.

217
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:42,623
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I meant.

218
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:43,684
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was thinking.

219
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:47,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome Show Never Let It Stop, Salt Tech.

220
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:49,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

221
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,170
[SPEAKER_15]: So, wait, wait, was the question, should he get the PSP, or?

222
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,632
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're ever going to have the remote play.

223
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, remote play on PSP.

224
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they already had something like that.

225
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:05,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's talking about in the other direction, where you can play PSP games on your PS3.

226
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, um... Maybe someday.

227
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

228
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:41,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I can understand that, and maybe Sony will do that whole compatibility in reverse thing, but because of the video out, and because Sony doesn't feel that their controller sucks, don't hold your breath.

229
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:42,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

230
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:43,860
[SPEAKER_15]: GeekBoy

231
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:13,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR crew, I've been looking unsuccessfully for free lessons in programming languages.

232
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:18,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I've wanted to learn how to learn programming languages for some time now.

233
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:22,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to know if you knew any good websites and which languages I should learn.

234
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Geekboy.

235
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can learn to learn anything, I suppose.

236
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:33,845
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want to start off, you know, easy, try something like, you know,

237
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Visual Basic, maybe, because you can use that in Word and all kinds of other programs.

238
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,233
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

239
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,974
[SPEAKER_15]: If he ain't writing in ZZT, you ain't shit.

240
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:46,576
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just kidding.

241
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:49,938
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you need to learn Fortran.

242
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:51,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez, Pascal.

243
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:52,459
[SPEAKER_15]: How about Logo?

244
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:55,740
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:18,361
[SPEAKER_15]: That game will teach you a lot about programming, even though it's like years old.

246
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:23,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of these games that are game maker type games, it's a really good place to start.

247
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:29,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Because programming and all that is a lot about logic and a way of thinking and debugging your stuff.

248
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,490
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I don't do it.

249
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not logical.

250
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, look.

251
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:36,354
[SPEAKER_15]: When I originally went to college, I was studying originally like computer programming.

252
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,135
[SPEAKER_15]: And I started with a C++ class.

253
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:39,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I hated it.

254
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:41,478
[SPEAKER_15]: And I decided this is not for me.

255
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:48,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I quit database management because as soon as I went through the VBasic stuff, I was like, I hate this.

256
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:54,003
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of people in chat yelling C++, Java, C, Basic.

257
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:55,844
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say, honestly...

258
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:58,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Who uses basic anymore?

259
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,488
[SPEAKER_15]: But why not?

260
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:01,749
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's the thing.

261
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:09,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Start with one of these game maker type programs that teach you how to think logically and debug your games.

262
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:11,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you're ready to start with a programming language.

263
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:12,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Think about it.

264
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:28,219
[SPEAKER_15]: And seriously, check out ZZT, it rocks Xenocore says, turn him to Game Maker 7 Make a game while you learn coding techniques That's exactly the kind of thing I'm thinking is a good starting point Because if you try to just jump in and learn C You're going to be in over your head, buddy Yeah

265
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:32,748
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to have the... You always build up to whatever.

266
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:33,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

267
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:36,191
[SPEAKER_15]: And Alpha Canogram says TI-83 Basic for the win.

268
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah!

269
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:37,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one.

270
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:42,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the Texas Instruments computer that had the little cartridges that you slid on the side.

271
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:44,239
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had the Basic book.

272
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:48,203
[SPEAKER_15]: I will write you a Commodore 64 basic program right now.

273
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:48,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

274
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:55,088
[SPEAKER_15]: 10 space print space quote Rob is awesome quote enter.

275
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:58,650
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 space go to 10 enter.

276
00:19:59,371 --> 00:19:59,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Run.

277
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Programming lesson here on OLR.

278
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:05,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure you've got plenty of printer paper.

279
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:24,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, this one comes from Katamari's Forever.

280
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:29,443
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I want to thank you, OLR, for naming Space Channel 5 your classic game of the week last week.

281
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I was beaming with excitement when Jamie said those words.

282
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:34,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, thank Sauce for that, because she's the one who told me to do it.

283
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:36,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Sauce.

284
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:39,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, even though you're not listening to us to watch the Tony Awards.

285
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,738
[SPEAKER_09]: She didn't hear that now because she's watching the Tony Awards.

286
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:47,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, I want to give a shout out to an OL Army, Carizzle.

287
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:52,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice that I found him on another forum, Red Flag Deals.

288
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:55,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you get excited when you see a random OL Army around an event?

289
00:20:57,165 --> 00:21:12,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and by the way, this reminds me, I finally got around to making a character on the Ragnarok server that you have to guess which one I'm playing on, named DarkSakura with the party OL Army, so if you find me, you get a prize.

290
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:14,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to tell you where I am, though.

291
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:15,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

292
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:16,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a few people know.

293
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:21,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And third, remember when someone nuked your article from Wikipedia?

294
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:29,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I was laughing out loud when I found out that under the beautiful Katamari article was none other than you, OLR, when the article referenced the story you posted about the game.

295
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you're in places you think you're not in.

296
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:37,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, wanted to say I'm playing Space Channel 5 Part 2 now and talk to you later.

297
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:38,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Katamari's forever.

298
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:39,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

299
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:40,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

300
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:41,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob!

301
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:41,688
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

302
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:44,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that's still a live parody thread?

303
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:46,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I finished the song and put it on this email.

304
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:47,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Please listen.

305
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:48,648
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be greatly appreciated.

306
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe put in a bonus segment.

307
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,210
[SPEAKER_09]: How about we make that our fortune cookie?

308
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, better yet, so the podcast listeners can hear it.

309
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:55,753
[SPEAKER_15]: We will play it at the end of the show.

310
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even remember why, what we had to do with that game.

311
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess we were... Did we announce it earlier or something?

312
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:01,363
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember.

313
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:01,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Guitar Hero 80s Edition.

314
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: What about 80s edition?

315
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:22,063
[SPEAKER_15]: We're linked from the article in Wikipedia.

316
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, for some reason, we're referenced in the article.

317
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember why.

318
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:26,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we may have talked about it earlier.

319
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:26,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

320
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:27,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

321
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:29,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's my question.

322
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:31,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Did anyone ever try to recreate the Wiki article?

323
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:32,588
[SPEAKER_00]: They should.

324
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:33,608
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so, too.

325
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:34,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Recreate it.

326
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:42,733
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason why it got nuked is because they said it wasn't sourced or that it didn't prove its relevance or whatever.

327
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:44,434
[SPEAKER_15]: But, dude, we're coming up on our sixth birthday.

328
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:45,686
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

329
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:59,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar Hero 1980s Edition.

330
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:06,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an Activision announcement, though no other source has cited this announcement.

331
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:15,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Activision officially revealed the first details of the game as May 11, 2007, in addition to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s.

332
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And it never came out, though, in that time.

333
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:20,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember what it was, though.

334
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,152
[SPEAKER_15]: It was some type of sales presentation thing that you had.

335
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:27,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember that's what it was.

336
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,393
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why no one else would have had it.

337
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:31,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

338
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember what it was from.

339
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:38,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from Destination PlayStation because it's retailers only.

340
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:39,117
[SPEAKER_02]: No press.

341
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:40,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

342
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:44,483
[SPEAKER_09]: This one goes for the World of Warcraft players.

343
00:23:45,143 --> 00:23:45,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

344
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:47,524
[SPEAKER_09]: From Lord Katakos.

345
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,446
[SPEAKER_09]: What server do you guys play WoW on?

346
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, my 77 priest I mailed you about two months ago was hacked.

347
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:59,550
[SPEAKER_09]: But I restarted on a private server called Dagon MS, I guess.

348
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm now level 168.

349
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:03,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, you can't be that high in WoW.

350
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:05,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you sure this is about WoW or is this RagnarKrak?

351
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Horde side, Horde has cookies

352
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:41,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I looked up Dagon MS and it's a freaking MapleStory.

353
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:43,794
[SPEAKER_15]: MapleStory?

354
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:46,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Get out of here!

355
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:48,238
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just kidding.

356
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie doesn't play MapleStory.

357
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:50,500
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

358
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:52,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Help me don't play that.

359
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:55,144
[SPEAKER_15]: And, by the way, the...

360
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

361
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: if anyone wants to find out and it's only going to be a casual guild I'm not going to let anyone else invite anyone unless I trust them but find me on what is that chat thing we use?

362
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:36,736
[SPEAKER_09]: IRC and I might tell you

363
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:48,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to point out too, because this is in the JustinTV chat, going back to the kid who was asking about the programming languages, wanting to know more about where to start with that.

364
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:56,452
[SPEAKER_15]: AkumaJP, who works for game companies in Japan, suggests download the iPhone SDK.

365
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:57,112
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fun.

366
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:57,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Start from there.

367
00:25:58,113 --> 00:25:58,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Not see, though.

368
00:25:59,573 --> 00:26:00,453
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even think about that.

369
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,614
[SPEAKER_15]: There's that whole new development kit that iPhone's got.

370
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:04,574
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be kind of fun.

371
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:06,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Good suggestion.

372
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:07,715
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually officially supported now.

373
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:13,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey OLR, Amplitude here.

374
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:21,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm listening to Part B of this week's show at work, and the whole tangent on how awesome arcades used to be really got me to start thinking.

375
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:28,990
[SPEAKER_09]: We, or at least those of us from that era, certainly can name some arcades that are on the decline and what happened, but reminiscing will only get us so far.

376
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like we never quite found an explanation for this.

377
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:38,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we point fingers at corporate America and say that things were bought out and consequently ambushed?

378
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:42,255
[SPEAKER_09]: But is anyone else looking at it from a different perspective?

379
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:44,816
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the kids that go to the arcades or lack thereof?

380
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:53,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Nowadays, if you were spotted at a local arcade, you're pegged as a gamer and all the stereotypes are realized and you begin to accumulate what can only be described as loser points.

381
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the long email slash rant amplitude.

382
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:56,332
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

383
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:59,773
[SPEAKER_09]: This email brought to you by Subject Hometown here, home of the test subject here.

384
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what you did there.

385
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:19,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Good thought.

386
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:20,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

387
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:23,786
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we ever did get down to the bottom of what happened to arcades.

388
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:26,767
[SPEAKER_15]: There was money to be made in birthday parties.

389
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:28,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we should do our first investigative story.

390
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,308
[SPEAKER_15]: An OLR, investigative report.

391
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:32,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

392
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:33,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

393
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,009
[SPEAKER_08]: We should.

394
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:37,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, you head that up because I wouldn't even know where to begin.

395
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie goes to college and works full time.

396
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:42,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob works full time and Rob has other things going on too.

397
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:42,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you know.

398
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:43,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

399
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you work full time and is very busy with other things.

400
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:50,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Junami, get on that.

401
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:51,714
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

402
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:53,735
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shiny dollar in it for you.

403
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:56,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Susan B with your name on it.

404
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,702
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do want to, one part of the email said people don't go because they're afraid of being a nerd.

405
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:03,623
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

406
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:05,164
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that can't be true.

407
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:07,666
[SPEAKER_15]: People are dorks because they go to arcades?

408
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:09,575
[SPEAKER_15]: by some guy who doesn't know you

409
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:23,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

410
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just being a bitch.

411
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:29,728
[SPEAKER_15]: But seriously, you know, it's like, I don't... The hell with what they think!

412
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:31,209
[SPEAKER_15]: So what if they think you're a geek?

413
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:38,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Cheeseburger points out for programming languages, PHP, Python, C++, Java, Ruby, Perl, and if you learn HTML, it will be easier.

414
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:40,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, okay?

415
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,237
[SPEAKER_09]: HTML is freaking easy.

416
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,920
[SPEAKER_09]: So... We're almost done.

417
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:47,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray.

418
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:51,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello OLR, it is Janai from Las Vegas.

419
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:56,314
[SPEAKER_09]: As of typing this email, I have returned from the Video Game Live concert in Henderson, Nevada.

420
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,175
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a must-see event.

421
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:03,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I wore my Professor Layton costume and gave people gold coins that noticed who I was dressed as.

422
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:13,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I was backstage for the costume contest and even though I didn't win, I got to see Martin Leung, the famous piano player who played the Super Mario theme blindfolded on YouTube.

423
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I quickly said, I love your YouTube videos and he replied with a cool thank you and that made my day.

424
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:24,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome lighting, great music selection, both new and classic games, and Tommy Tallarico kept changing his clothes, which was strange.

425
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:28,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I give this show a solid 100% rating.

426
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:33,187
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's coming to your town or close by, you must see it, and yes, they have international dates this year.

427
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:37,355
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm really glad you read that email.

428
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:41,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it gives me a chance to say we have a guest coming on the show.

429
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:43,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Not next week, but the week after.

430
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,520
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to be on the show on the 29th.

431
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Sunday the 29th.

432
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:50,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Tommy Tallarico is going to be on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live.

433
00:29:50,864 --> 00:29:53,785
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will ask him for you about why the wardrobe changed.

434
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:54,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

435
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:02,980
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, and we're going to be asking you about the world tour and what people can expect this year and all that fun stuff.

436
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all expenses paid tickets to see it overseas.

437
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:07,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't push it.

438
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,809
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, Tommy Tallarico will be here in two weeks.

439
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:11,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

440
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:12,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Last one!

441
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:49,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, by the way, just to answer the questions in chat, Tommy will not actually be here in studio because he has this whole Video Games Live thing going on he's also trying to do.

442
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:52,554
[SPEAKER_15]: But he will take a little time to... We're going to have a seance and channel in.

443
00:30:52,714 --> 00:30:53,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Plug it on our show!

444
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:54,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

445
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Last one comes from our very good friend Vandalus.

446
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,062
[SPEAKER_09]: We miss you!

447
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:01,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy Father's Day, Vandalist.

448
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:02,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Father's Day to you.

449
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:04,667
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got a small army.

450
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:07,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I have lost count of how many children Vandalist has.

451
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I think five.

452
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:09,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

453
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:10,173
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at least five.

454
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Father's Day.

455
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:12,556
[SPEAKER_09]: You've earned it.

456
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:13,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you have.

457
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:14,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a bit.

458
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Several times over.

459
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:16,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And we miss you.

460
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,401
[SPEAKER_09]: We really miss you.

461
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Come back and visit us soon.

462
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:18,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Mm-hmm.

463
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:22,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey gang, it's Terry slash Vandalist.

464
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:24,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're all doing well.

465
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:31,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to pass on a news story I just blogged about in my weekend news job at www.hardocp.com

466
00:31:35,838 --> 00:32:04,078
[SPEAKER_09]: it's about the US Army's new recruitment tactic Interactive Centers and he sent me a link to it but he continues with full size mockups Apache helicopter simulations look like America's Army was just the beginning and tells us to take care and actually what it is is they're having recruitment centers set up with simulators for full scale mockups of equipment and a gaming arena that uses America's Army and

467
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:18,847
[SPEAKER_09]: so that instead of doing the whole, having a commercial to show what you might happen, they actually have something that, in fact, it was even quoted from Major Larry Dillard, who's a U.S.

468
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:20,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Army marketing executive.

469
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:24,431
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, the modeling command and control systems are like those used in Iraq.

470
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:40,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we said earlier, there's an Apache simulator for pilot and co-pilot that uses the flight and weapon system, a Black Hawk helicopter that has four door gunner positions and an armored Humvee vehicle simulator.

471
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I kind of want to do that myself.

472
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:46,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Humvee simulator?

473
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, with turrets and that type of thing.

474
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,141
[SPEAKER_09]: It just makes me think of that.

475
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:53,141
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that movie?

476
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:55,604
[SPEAKER_15]: The Army is innovative.

477
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:57,765
[SPEAKER_15]: They're very innovative at this stuff.

478
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:58,886
[SPEAKER_15]: They do their job well.

479
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:01,368
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I can really say.

480
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:02,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart folks there.

481
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using that wonderful America's Army.

482
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, whatever happened to America's Army 2?

483
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:09,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right.

484
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:10,496
[SPEAKER_02]: That game sucked.

485
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:11,877
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's still going.

486
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:13,859
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got a cult following to it.

487
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:16,061
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

488
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:18,914
[SPEAKER_15]: That it for Mailbag?

489
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:19,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes!

490
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:21,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

491
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get back to some news.

492
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:23,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

493
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:25,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of funny, though.

494
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:32,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there is a game someone noticed that's reusing Oblivion's graphics.

495
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game itself is called Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds weird anyways.

496
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:43,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is blatantly ripping off Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

497
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,044
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they had a screenshot...

498
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:54,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Comparison, and... Yeah, it's near identical, except for maybe the fire effects are shittier than the other game.

499
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:55,756
[SPEAKER_02]: No word...

500
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:01,411
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on what else they may have stolen.

501
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:05,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It says apparently also... Oh, there are some updates to the story.

502
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:10,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently also they stole an environment from Thief Deadly Shadows as well.

503
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:15,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently Joystick just heard back from the U.S.

504
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:21,187
[SPEAKER_02]: publisher TriSynergy who told them that the similarities between the two are striking...

505
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:26,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were just as shocked as anybody else and we put the line into Majestic.

506
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:32,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We had no idea that any of this had been happening in the game and things would have been different if we had known.

507
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, Bethesda is making this game themselves?

508
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:37,717
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Majestic.

509
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:45,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Majestic is the company making the game and it's being published by some company called TriSynergy.

510
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:49,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Majestic actually made a phone call to Bethesda and this is what they had to say.

511
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Except in this case, they actually can't do it that much better.

512
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,327
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they can't.

513
00:34:57,547 --> 00:34:57,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh...

514
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:09,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of funny though.

515
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:18,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what else they're going to... It says they also think that the game stole some artwork from Diablo 2.

516
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,340
[SPEAKER_02]: A shield called the Wall of Eyeless or something.

517
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:25,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

518
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,205
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stealing from everybody.

519
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:30,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Azaku says bullshit who the fuck was producing that game and greenlighted the copyrighted textures without consulting a lawyer

520
00:35:56,277 --> 00:35:56,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

521
00:35:57,898 --> 00:35:58,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it bullshit?

522
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is it the real deal?

523
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:01,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Only time will tell.

524
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:06,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, let's go back to some more gaming news.

525
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:11,851
[SPEAKER_15]: In the law world, two guys are suing EA.

526
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:14,155
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

527
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:48,118
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're saying that because of the NFL license, EA is engaging in, quote, blatantly anti-competitive conduct, and they are seeking, quote, restitution and damages for those who purchased an EA football game since August of 2005, disgorgement of all profits made as a result of anti-competitive actions, and that the infringing agreements be declared null and void.

528
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:49,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

529
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Not EA, as much as I hate to say that.

530
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:17,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And for those of you that don't understand legal translation so much, we actually had somebody try to simplify this lawsuit for us, and they translated it for us.

531
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:17,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is.

532
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:20,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Wah, wah, wah, wah.

533
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:22,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

534
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:23,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Bitch, bitch, bitch.

535
00:37:24,445 --> 00:37:24,825
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is.

536
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:26,606
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what this lawsuit's all about.

537
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:36,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, stories like this, I don't know about you guys, but whenever I hear about all these type of frivolous lawsuit type things, I get a little bit angsty.

538
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:38,511
[SPEAKER_15]: and Mad.

539
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:41,412
[SPEAKER_15]: And that always necessitates some FUs.

540
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:02,395
[SPEAKER_09]: To myself, I left my laptop at home and had to go back and get it.

541
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:05,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence my late arrival.

542
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:34,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki FD is the guy in front of me at Burger King because apparently he didn't know what he wanted to order and then he proceeded to order like half the menu because I was waiting behind him for like 10 minutes while he proceeded to wait for his food to be delivered to his car in about 5 to 6 bags Nice Yes, I love people Oh, and he was smoking right there in front of the window too Nice Which is awesome, he's a winner

543
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:42,588
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU of the week goes to the root canal I had on Thursday.

544
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:43,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Ow.

545
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:46,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Root canals are not fun.

546
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,530
[SPEAKER_15]: An FU to the fact that I think there's a problem with it.

547
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:50,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

548
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have to see the dentist next week.

549
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:53,491
[SPEAKER_15]: FU to dentistry.

550
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:55,972
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my FU of the week.

551
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:57,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get back to gaming news.

552
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:58,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we gotta?

553
00:38:58,953 --> 00:38:59,513
[SPEAKER_15]: We gotta.

554
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:00,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

555
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:02,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Penny Arcade.

556
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:04,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

557
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:05,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.

558
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:07,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, I'm wrong.

559
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, did you get ahead of yourself?

560
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:10,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did.

561
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Penny Arcade, coming up soon.

562
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:12,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

563
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:12,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Later in the program.

564
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:14,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Squeenix!

565
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:15,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

566
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:27,791
[SPEAKER_09]: There actually is a trailer up for the new MMO, Concerto Gate, and it's going to be a free MMO RPG, and it's pretty.

567
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:36,755
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually the sequel to Crossgate, which was an MMO that was in Japan since 2001.

568
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:40,104
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's just very cute.

569
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to give it a try.

570
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:45,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray for free and hooray for cute, right?

571
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,230
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as it's not MapleStory.

572
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:49,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

573
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Why all the hate for MapleStory?

574
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:52,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

575
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never even played MapleStory.

576
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look fun.

577
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:56,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

578
00:39:56,457 --> 00:39:59,620
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, spoiled Ragnarok online.

579
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Ragnarok has withstood the test of time.

580
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:03,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

581
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

582
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:05,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure has.

583
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:07,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

584
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:15,372
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing Ragnarok does not have that Dungeon Runners does have is a bling gnome.

585
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:17,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, a bling gnome.

586
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:20,614
[SPEAKER_02]: What per se is a bling gnome, you may ask?

587
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm about to tell you.

588
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,716
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a gnome with bling?

589
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:25,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sort of.

590
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:35,698
[SPEAKER_02]: A bling gnome is a pet of sorts that runs around and picks up all gold dropped from bad guys while you also kill other things.

591
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:43,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gnome also will pick up dropped items that aren't rare and eat them.

592
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:45,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he poops out gold as a reward.

593
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:47,990
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the best thing ever!

594
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a gnome that poops gold!

595
00:40:51,823 --> 00:41:15,943
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have screenshots to back it up yes, the bling gnome who either has loot or woot tattooed to his stomach I don't know but it's kind of funny and for those who may not be familiar with Dungeon Runner it is a free MMO where can you check this game out if you want to see this amazing pooping gnome?

596
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:19,967
[SPEAKER_15]: DungeonRunners.com oh well, I should have been able to figure that one out, huh?

597
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, this is the best thing ever!

598
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,172
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does have woot on him.

599
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:25,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's loot.

600
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought it was a woot.

601
00:41:27,877 --> 00:41:28,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a little of both.

602
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe woot on the front and loot on the back.

603
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:31,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's poot.

604
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:35,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he poops out, you know.

605
00:41:36,854 --> 00:41:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

606
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:00,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

607
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:21,313
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

608
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:45,659
[SPEAKER_15]: SIV4 Colonization

609
00:43:11,701 --> 00:43:13,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here it is.

610
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:15,782
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that for your tremendous long wait?

611
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:16,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

612
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:20,043
[SPEAKER_09]: The Penny Arcade game is now available on Steam.

613
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's called Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness.

614
00:43:26,965 --> 00:43:29,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode 1 is there at www.

615
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:39,473
[SPEAKER_09]: SteamGames.com and it will also be offering the future episodes there.

616
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:43,057
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are achievements available for Steam purchasers.

617
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So go check it out.

618
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,661
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, the game is very funny.

619
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:50,123
[SPEAKER_09]: There's our first review.

620
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,344
[SPEAKER_09]: You heard it here.

621
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:52,465
[SPEAKER_15]: If you haven't heard.

622
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:54,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you have.

623
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:55,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you know.

624
00:43:55,788 --> 00:43:57,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And knowing is half the battle.

625
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Or whatever.

626
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:00,877
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate you.

627
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you too.

628
00:44:04,543 --> 00:44:05,064
[SPEAKER_08]: You know me.

629
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:11,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Neverwinter Nights 2 is getting yet another expansion.

630
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:21,116
[SPEAKER_02]: The new expansion is being called Storm of Zeher, and it's going to be the second expansion for the game that came out in 2006.

631
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:27,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It will add a single-player campaign with approximately 15 hours of gameplay.

632
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:33,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It will add new classes, spells, creatures, and a new playable race system.

633
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:46,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is a new Overland map that is being introduced that will allow players to explore the Chultun Peninsula, Sword Coast, and Samarit.

634
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:54,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And looks like they also have got... Looks like that's pretty much it.

635
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's due out, I guess, the fourth quarter of this year.

636
00:44:57,642 --> 00:45:00,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So, something around Christmas, perhaps.

637
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:01,012
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

638
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:31,220
[SPEAKER_15]: One last story tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

639
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Click on Interact With Us to see all the different ways you can give us a call.

640
00:45:34,282 --> 00:45:40,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or our free 800 number for US and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

641
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:47,372
[SPEAKER_15]: But first, one more story for you guys, and it's a little bit of a retro, some retro goodness.

642
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:49,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Quick, how do you get 30 lives in Contra?

643
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:53,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

644
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:53,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

645
00:45:53,894 --> 00:45:56,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody knows the famous Konami code, right?

646
00:45:56,216 --> 00:45:59,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how do you get all of the power-ups in Gradius?

647
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,502
[SPEAKER_15]: You pause the game and then up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

648
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:03,303
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you do it in Proteus?

649
00:46:03,643 --> 00:46:04,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

650
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:05,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Backwards.

651
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:06,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

652
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:07,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

653
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,629
[SPEAKER_15]: So everybody knows that freaking Konami code.

654
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:15,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what's funny is that you can actually use this code in Google Reader.

655
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:20,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, this code works in Google Reader, presented from Google.

656
00:46:20,663 --> 00:46:35,932
[SPEAKER_15]: If you put up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A on your keyboard, and you don't have to hit start because there is no start key on your keyboard, all of your unread items will be reset to 30, and a little ninja will come on the screen to watch you surf RSS feeds.

657
00:46:38,793 --> 00:46:40,274
[SPEAKER_15]: And you might be asking, why?

658
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:43,096
[SPEAKER_15]: And to that I say, why the hell not?

659
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:45,205
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

660
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,596
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think this game is going to come out for Xbox 360?

661
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:15,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody like me who's thinking of taking the plunge to get PlayStation 3 soon to play a game like this ought to just wait?

662
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:30,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

663
00:47:31,176 --> 00:47:37,199
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the reasons why I think is because of the amount of if they don't pull the certain amount of system that they need that they're going to have to come over.

664
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:37,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Notice Bioshock.

665
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:09,130
[SPEAKER_03]: and notice Assassin's Creed that was supposed to be originally for only exclusive Xbox 360 how it goes on the other system.

666
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:15,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just think that maybe they just kept everybody quiet and hopefully it's going to come over to Xbox 360 in order for them to make money.

667
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:22,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see that little thing that was making the rounds around the internet this week about kind of the joke that's inside Metal Gear about having to change discs?

668
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:25,924
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the guy says, oh wait, no, you don't have to change discs because you're playing a Blu-ray game.

669
00:48:26,224 --> 00:48:26,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see that?

670
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:40,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

671
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

672
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:43,195
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't seen that.

673
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:47,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I try my best to ignore all my friends that actually bought into the hype.

674
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:52,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really understand because you know how Microsoft is moving over to Blu-ray.

675
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:54,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that part.

676
00:48:54,387 --> 00:48:58,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't necessarily need to be on a Blu-ray disc for it to work as well.

677
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:00,233
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm thinking that it's...

678
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:05,581
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a good chance it could... They could always revamp it and change it, you know, for it to work with 360.

679
00:49:06,302 --> 00:49:14,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but even if Microsoft came out with a Blu-ray player, which, you know, that rumor... We brought that rumor up on last week's show and then Monday came, no announcement.

680
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:19,691
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's say Microsoft did come out with a Blu-ray player, although at this point I don't think they will until their next system.

681
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:21,172
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's say they did.

682
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:22,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's say they came out with a Blu-ray player.

683
00:49:22,453 --> 00:49:26,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think they're going to start putting out games on that player because they're going to want to tap into their existing user base.

684
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:29,919
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't want to suddenly say games can only be on this... You know, I...

685
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:31,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't think there'd be enough market for that.

686
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

687
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:43,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the user base is bigger on Xbox 360, and I think they'd rather tap into that user base.

688
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they could be more influenced by Konami, because the game isn't necessarily, it's not like Sony owns Konami in any way.

689
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:53,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

690
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, I would love to see the Xbox 360 port happen as well, but I don't know.

691
00:49:58,981 --> 00:50:04,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes, for whatever reason, they like to keep these things system exclusive for whatever backdoor deals happen.

692
00:50:05,343 --> 00:50:06,143
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we'll see.

693
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:10,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Konami will keep denying it, but E3 would be a good time for them to announce it if they wanted to.

694
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:14,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right, and that didn't come up yet as well.

695
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:15,666
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

696
00:50:15,826 --> 00:50:18,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot.

697
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:19,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, take care, buddy.

698
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:19,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for calling.

699
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be crossing my fingers for you on the Xbox 360 Metal Gear.

700
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:24,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

701
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:26,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of me says not going to happen.

702
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they've denied it so many times.

703
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if they were to come out and release on 360 now, I don't know.

704
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,065
[SPEAKER_15]: They'd have to have a lot of extras or something to kind of justify it.

705
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:35,805
[SPEAKER_15]: But we'll see.

706
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:36,486
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

707
00:50:36,506 --> 00:50:36,866
[SPEAKER_15]: You never know.

708
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:38,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

709
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:39,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

710
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:41,269
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Oscar.

711
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:42,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Oscar.

712
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:42,650
[SPEAKER_15]: What's on your mind, buddy?

713
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

714
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:49,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just happy that I managed to get my hands on the Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition this week.

715
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:50,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, what'd you think?

716
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:51,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even reserve the game either.

717
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:52,647
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that?

718
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even reserve the game either, and I found it.

719
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:58,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they did a pretty good job.

720
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,211
[SPEAKER_15]: They knew the demand was going to be pretty high for this, so they made a lot of copies of it.

721
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:02,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what'd you think?

722
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Surely you've opened it up by now.

723
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:03,713
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think?

724
00:51:06,194 --> 00:51:10,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've only had time to play about three hours of it so far, and it's pretty great.

725
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:11,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like really epic.

726
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:14,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the only word you can describe it.

727
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:18,772
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's kind of the consensus around here at OLR Studios this evening.

728
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:19,592
[SPEAKER_15]: The game is epic.

729
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:21,214
[SPEAKER_15]: What makes it so epic?

730
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:22,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it just the cutscenes epic?

731
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:25,437
[SPEAKER_15]: What is it that makes the game so epic?

732
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:37,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember back when Hideo Kojima, he was all talking about how the PS3 was the only system he wanted to be in because he wanted it to be like a movie, basically.

733
00:51:37,585 --> 00:51:39,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it kind of plays like a movie to me.

734
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:40,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

735
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:48,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's my question because you have, you know, the cutscenes and we've heard a lot about the cutscenes and how they're very long and how they're very epic.

736
00:51:48,702 --> 00:51:50,663
[SPEAKER_15]: How about the game itself?

737
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:53,104
[SPEAKER_15]: The actual game that you are playing?

738
00:51:53,184 --> 00:51:54,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, is the game cool?

739
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's it considered?

740
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:01,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a... What kind of game is it even considered?

741
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a strategy shooter or something like that?

742
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,912
[SPEAKER_15]: A stealth action strategy game.

743
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:07,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

744
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

745
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:09,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

746
00:52:10,976 --> 00:52:12,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, usually the games are kind of like that.

747
00:52:13,278 --> 00:52:18,524
[SPEAKER_04]: All I can think of is Rainbow Six maybe, but I got bored with Rainbow Six.

748
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:19,445
[SPEAKER_04]: This, I didn't.

749
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:21,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very into it.

750
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:29,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it because the story really draws you in in a way that maybe Rainbow Six doesn't really have quite the same epic cutscenes?

751
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That has to be it.

752
00:52:32,377 --> 00:52:33,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Rainbow Six, the story was...

753
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:35,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, board me.

754
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:40,353
[SPEAKER_15]: As I was saying earlier in the show, Kojima's always been a bit of a storyteller, even in the NES days.

755
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:52,057
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the very, very first Metal Gear game that was on the NES, or really MSX, if you want to go that far back, kind of had depth and story that not a lot of games of that time had.

756
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Queltipo in chat says it's tactical espionage action.

757
00:52:56,779 --> 00:52:57,199
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot.

758
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,960
[SPEAKER_15]: It even says it right there on the box.

759
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,581
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be the genre the game fits into.

760
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:02,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's what I thought it was.

761
00:53:03,122 --> 00:53:03,562
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

762
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:03,802
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

763
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:32,263
[SPEAKER_15]: and there's no guard humping in this one I got Mario Kart Wii and I challenge you alright, we'll make it happen we'll have to set up a time I'll try to set up something in the forums this week because Bobby Blackwolf wants to have a go at it too so I'll try to set something up when we're both available alright we'll let you know alright, later buddy alright, see ya see ya

764
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:36,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

765
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:37,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

766
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:40,648
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Spazinator.

767
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:42,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind, buddy?

768
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just want to kind of comment on like two or three things, if I may.

769
00:53:49,012 --> 00:53:49,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

770
00:53:50,153 --> 00:53:56,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's for your little rant about Nintendo earlier in Part A. Uh-huh.

771
00:53:56,036 --> 00:53:56,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy's next.

772
00:53:57,225 --> 00:53:59,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Only thing I'm going to say is right on.

773
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:04,369
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I've been more or less boycotting them for the past 10 or 11 years.

774
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:16,376
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I can't speak for everyone out there, but personally, I feel that Nintendo really hasn't been pointing out anything for their systems.

775
00:54:16,436 --> 00:54:24,041
[SPEAKER_05]: They've really been overly compelling, aside from maybe one or two titles for the past couple systems.

776
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:48,697
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, you know, you know, of course, you know, Super, or Smash Brothers, Brawl, and whatnot, notwithstanding, but, you know, the last really truly system they really had was the Super Nintendo, uh, but, you know, you know, granted, yeah, the N64 did have a, you know, a few good games out there, you know, like GoldenEye and whatnot, but,

777
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,124
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, aside from that, ever since then, they've been going, like, downhill ever since then.

778
00:54:54,404 --> 00:55:08,537
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've cooled off a little bit since I got very hot-headed during Part A. And, you know, I'm a little regretful that the actions of this guy at Nintendo of Europe kind of hurts the company's image as a whole.

779
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:13,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Right on down, you know, from people, the president, you know, from Reggie Visamay,

780
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:19,906
[SPEAKER_15]: All the way down to the little people that work at Nintendo, you know, that probably don't deserve a boycott or what have you.

781
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:28,813
[SPEAKER_15]: But damn it, something has got to give, and we have got to show that this guy is made of suck for making this statement and needs to...

782
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:32,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Something beyond just a little apology needs to happen.

783
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:48,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Because here's the thing, and the reason why I said it's part of my boycott, that if Nintendo addresses it, I would be okay with it, and I would end my boycott, is because if Nintendo were to address it, it would invalidate everything this guy said about it being for Geeks and Otaku, and this guy would look like a moron.

784
00:55:50,174 --> 00:56:02,262
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's part of the reason why I said that, you know, I will forgive and forget if Nintendo will say, look, we are going to do something about it, and it's not just for Geeks New Taku.

785
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:14,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you know, that guy's comments kind of factors into, like, you know, my opinion that, you know, over the past few years, you know, Nintendo has been

786
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it could be termed as an over-inflated ego.

787
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:27,374
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been kind of like, I don't know if you want to call it Russ and the Laurels or whatever.

788
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:33,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely prevalent on all sides of Nintendo.

789
00:56:33,918 --> 00:56:41,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold up, since Super Nintendo, after Super Nintendo, Nintendo did not exactly enjoy world success with the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube.

790
00:56:41,623 --> 00:56:44,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Granted, those systems weren't failure per se, but...

791
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:46,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

792
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:48,326
[SPEAKER_02]: They still think they're fucking cocky.

793
00:56:49,046 --> 00:56:50,627
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it on the retail side.

794
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it also on the consumer side.

795
00:56:55,308 --> 00:57:00,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's just their mentality.

796
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:05,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They control their market with the releasing of their systems and stuff like that.

797
00:57:06,231 --> 00:57:09,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of shortage going around that's intentional.

798
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:10,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

799
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:20,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but at the same time, they're doing this stuff with suing third-party peripheral manufacturers.

800
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:29,413
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff, they have a schedule of how they're going to release this stuff, and they're going to slowly roll out stuff to keep people interested.

801
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:30,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Wii Fit and stuff.

802
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,458
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii console, people finally have it now, and they're just like...

803
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:38,792
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we get people interested in this console again like they were at launch?

804
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:39,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

805
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:42,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's release Wii Fit now and make that fucking hard to find.

806
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:43,135
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

807
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:45,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's all coming around again.

808
00:57:45,818 --> 00:57:47,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And watch when Wii Sports 2 comes out.

809
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go again.

810
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:57,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be a constant cycle and they're going to slowly roll out stuff that they should have rolled out at launch throughout the lifetime of this console.

811
00:57:57,728 --> 00:58:02,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody needs to tell Nintendo I made you and I can break you just as easily.

812
00:58:03,203 --> 00:58:08,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So much to tell Nintendo that people are going to stop waiting for stuff to happen and they're going to move on.

813
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:13,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they may buy your console, but they're not going to buy any of your games.

814
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Or buy your virtual console stuff.

815
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:19,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, they've made a little bit of money off of people from buying the console.

816
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:23,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine that they're making a ton of money on each console sales, but...

817
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:44,064
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are just staying there and playing Wii Sports and then say, forget it, this online stuff, it's not happening and I can't find space to save my games and stuff and have to re-download them later, people are just going to get confused and get overwhelmed by it and they're just going to say, forget it, I'm not going to do that.

818
00:58:44,924 --> 00:58:51,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sucks because the people that are actually supporting them and utilizing this stuff, they're just saying, you're not important.

819
00:58:53,584 --> 00:59:22,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't get me wrong, you know, at least way back in the day, I used to be a really big Nintendo fanboy and whatnot, but now once I started realizing that, you know, starting with N64, you know, relatively few games were coming out that I was particularly interested in, I kind of started, you know, slowly but surely moving over to the Sony camp, and I've been with Sony now for, you know, ever since, like, roughly when Final Fantasy VII came out.

820
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:35,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing, and in reference to what I said and stuff, is that I'm a Nintendo fanboy too, and this is what stinks about the whole thing.

821
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:44,251
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been so supportive of the Nintendo Wii, and I've spent a lot of money on those virtual console downloads to have this happen.

822
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:46,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:49,232
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of felt the same way going years back.

824
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:49,812
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's because they...

825
01:00:15,273 --> 01:00:30,499
[SPEAKER_05]: make comments, you know, because they weren't really keeping up with the times and they weren't, you know, their gains weren't really going up with the people that have been supporting them since way back when, you know.

826
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, you know, the people that grew up with the original NES or SNES, eventually their tastes and gains were going to change and

827
01:00:42,523 --> 01:00:43,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

828
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?

829
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:10,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, a lot of things.

830
01:01:11,078 --> 01:01:11,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, wait, wait.

831
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:12,839
[SPEAKER_15]: First thing I'm going to ask.

832
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:14,520
[SPEAKER_15]: You're coming out here in like two weeks, right?

833
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:15,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

834
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:15,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

835
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And you said something about you're going to fix our Justin TV cam when you're here?

836
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:21,182
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to do my best.

837
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:22,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I am very technically inclined.

838
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:23,123
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

839
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:24,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki thinks he can do it too.

840
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:28,685
[SPEAKER_15]: So between the two of you all, I think we're going to have a high-tech studio by the time the 4th of July rolls around.

841
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, believe you me.

842
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:30,845
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

843
01:01:30,865 --> 01:01:31,966
[SPEAKER_15]: You can talk about whatever you want to now.

844
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:32,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

845
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:33,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool, cool.

846
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:34,695
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of things.

847
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:40,360
[SPEAKER_14]: As for the guy from Nintendo of Europe by this comment, am I the only one that doesn't give two shits about what the hell he said?

848
01:01:42,842 --> 01:01:43,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here's the thing.

849
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

850
01:01:45,224 --> 01:01:46,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, I get called a geek.

851
01:01:46,906 --> 01:01:49,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I say thanks.

852
01:01:49,848 --> 01:01:54,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Being a geek is not a bad thing, but it's the fact that he was – and I think Jamie kind of referenced this.

853
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:58,275
[SPEAKER_15]: He was using these things as a derogatory thing, so he's basically saying –

854
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:02,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're not going to put something out because we don't really care about the people who want this.

855
01:02:02,757 --> 01:02:15,742
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's kind of like, well, F you because if I've spent $100 on all these different virtual console games I filled up and I was planning on spending even more, then if I'm just poo-poo to you, then forget it.

856
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:16,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to spend any more money.

857
01:02:17,783 --> 01:02:19,324
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a valid point.

858
01:02:19,744 --> 01:02:23,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the proper thing to say would have been Nintendo understands that this is –

859
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:30,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a problem, and we are addressing it, and we are working towards fixing said problem.

860
01:02:31,044 --> 01:02:36,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Or just say, he could have just said, unfortunately, at this time, Nintendo has no fix for this.

861
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:40,287
[SPEAKER_15]: He could have given the same BS, you know, the same line we've heard from Nintendo time and time again.

862
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:45,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, at this time, folks will have to delete the game, and they can always re-download it for free.

863
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,189
[SPEAKER_15]: He could have given that same line, and I wouldn't have cared.

864
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:53,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have still thought, Nintendo probably needs to address their storage issue at some point, but I wouldn't have cared.

865
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:54,831
[SPEAKER_15]: But the fact that he...

866
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:57,093
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it sounds like.

867
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and GameGuru says, and Iwata actually did say that, Rob, and I have nothing but nice things to say about Iwata.

868
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:18,924
[SPEAKER_15]: I have nothing but, I am a Nintendo fanboy.

869
01:03:19,224 --> 01:03:20,065
[SPEAKER_15]: The man's done a lot.

870
01:03:20,705 --> 01:03:26,929
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm fine with that line, because I understand they're dancing around the fact that their system has limitations, and that's the PC thing to say.

871
01:03:27,249 --> 01:03:30,671
[SPEAKER_15]: But for this guy to come out with guns a-blazin' is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

872
01:03:31,691 --> 01:03:32,512
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanna pick a fight?

873
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:33,572
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanna pick a fight?

874
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:35,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like the guy was PMSing.

875
01:03:36,843 --> 01:03:37,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

876
01:03:38,184 --> 01:03:38,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

877
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:40,345
[SPEAKER_15]: No more Nintendo Talk.

878
01:03:40,385 --> 01:03:40,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

879
01:03:40,805 --> 01:03:41,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done with it.

880
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:43,166
[SPEAKER_15]: So what else is on your mind?

881
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:47,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember growing up that arcades were the shit.

882
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:52,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember growing up, my aunt would take me to this place called Nathan's.

883
01:03:52,752 --> 01:03:53,592
[SPEAKER_14]: You go inside.

884
01:03:53,832 --> 01:03:55,113
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like heaven.

885
01:03:55,593 --> 01:03:59,055
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like 50, 60 different kinds of arcades you could play.

886
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:03,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I first got my hands on Final Fight and fell in love with Capcom right there.

887
01:04:03,778 --> 01:04:04,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

888
01:04:05,689 --> 01:04:12,992
[SPEAKER_14]: and nowadays it's like you go into like a little rinky-dink sports center where they have hockey, ice skating.

889
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:15,133
[SPEAKER_14]: You go upstairs, there's a concession stand.

890
01:04:15,293 --> 01:04:18,975
[SPEAKER_14]: You go around the corner, there's three arcade machines and a bootleg Cusar.

891
01:04:19,895 --> 01:04:26,998
[SPEAKER_15]: The place I remember was a little place called Nickel Mania where you would pay $2.50 to get in and then all the games ran on nickels.

892
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,439
[SPEAKER_15]: It was awesome.

893
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:30,439
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like the first place I ever played Mortal Kombat.

894
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,540
[SPEAKER_15]: That's cool.

895
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadly, it's no more.

896
01:04:35,222 --> 01:04:35,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know what?

897
01:04:36,063 --> 01:04:48,951
[SPEAKER_09]: When you make your visit out here, we're going to have to take you to Roseville Golf Land because that's really one of the last actual arcades.

898
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:51,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad you didn't throw in good in there.

899
01:04:53,753 --> 01:04:54,574
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what we got.

900
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:56,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a good way to phrase it.

901
01:04:56,755 --> 01:04:59,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan went to Scandia and he said that it's just completely meh.

902
01:05:00,878 --> 01:05:04,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Scandia is just confused on what it's trying to be anyways.

903
01:05:04,976 --> 01:05:09,620
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to take a trip to Milpitas Golf Land.

904
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:12,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that one's still fairly decent.

905
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:16,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Milpitas and Sunnyvale are still okay.

906
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:18,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunnyvale also has the test machines though.

907
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:22,672
[SPEAKER_15]: But slowly that stuff's been going out and Flamin' Fingers has been coming in.

908
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:25,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that Flamin' Fingers is a bad thing, but too much of it is.

909
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:27,076
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the jump rope game?

910
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:32,084
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have to also go to John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

911
01:05:32,585 --> 01:05:34,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we do need to go to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

912
01:05:34,688 --> 01:05:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: And you still haven't sent me a certain email, sir.

913
01:05:38,957 --> 01:05:41,459
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem, I'll resend it out.

914
01:05:42,219 --> 01:05:42,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

915
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Ranma, quickly, anything else before we end the show?

916
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:45,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, no, that's it.

917
01:05:45,682 --> 01:05:46,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, take care, buddy.

918
01:05:46,202 --> 01:05:46,442
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

919
01:05:46,462 --> 01:05:46,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye-bye.

920
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:12,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob D says, too much of the flaming finger is a bad thing.

921
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:15,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me clarify my statement.

922
01:06:15,273 --> 01:06:18,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Too much of the flaming finger requires soothing action.

923
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:21,339
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing wrong with a little flaming finger here and there.

924
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:26,404
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want to OD on flaming finger.

925
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:28,867
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to mix it up a little bit.

926
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:30,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, forget it.

927
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:32,921
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to do it for phone calls tonight.

928
01:06:32,941 --> 01:06:33,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you guys for calling in.

929
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:36,626
[SPEAKER_15]: If you didn't get through, so sorry, but send us an email or try again next week.

930
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:39,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you can always leave a voicemail.

931
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:41,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got voicemails we've got to play.

932
01:06:41,053 --> 01:06:42,455
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll try to catch up on those in a future week.

933
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,377
[SPEAKER_15]: For now, we've got to wrap it up.

934
01:06:45,504 --> 01:06:46,485
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

935
01:07:06,762 --> 01:07:07,083
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

936
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:07,563
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

937
01:07:07,603 --> 01:07:07,864
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

938
01:07:25,325 --> 01:07:31,009
[SPEAKER_02]: where it pays off to select different characters depending on the enemies you face or unique game environments you are in.

939
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:33,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Earn upgrades for each character you use.

940
01:07:33,991 --> 01:07:41,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Experience unique combos specific to two... Are they just reusing the Marvel Ultimate Alliance engine like over and over and over again?

941
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:42,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

942
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:44,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I should say X-Men Legends engine.

943
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyways.

944
01:07:48,602 --> 01:07:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else here.

945
01:07:52,244 --> 01:07:52,745
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got...

946
01:07:55,091 --> 01:08:05,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more stuff coming from this big leak list here, including... Oh, we already talked about all this stuff.

947
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,941
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the Mensa workout.

948
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:09,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this is going to be another brain training game for the Wii.

949
01:08:11,025 --> 01:08:14,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how extreme Makeover Home Edition is going to be any fun.

950
01:08:15,469 --> 01:08:15,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

951
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:21,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, there was a game I had on the Commodore 64 called like Dream House or something like that.

952
01:08:21,843 --> 01:08:28,805
[SPEAKER_15]: And pretty much all you did is you went through the house and you could paint all the, like you could paint the ceiling and the walls a different color, one of 16 colors.

953
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:32,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause you know, Commodore 64 was cutting edge and then you could put furniture in the house too.

954
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:36,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And, but you were only limited to like eight pieces of furniture in a room.

955
01:08:36,607 --> 01:08:38,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause you know, there's all those limitations on the 64.

956
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:41,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to God that half these games are fake.

957
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:46,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not really fake, but just concepts that are never going to come to pass.

958
01:08:46,092 --> 01:08:51,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if that's the case, there's going to be like 20 Spider-Man games coming out between now and probably a couple years from now.

959
01:08:51,996 --> 01:08:58,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Including Spider-Man Agile Warrior, where it lets players control Spider-Man with the Wii balance board.

960
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,702
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Spider-Man Hero Evolved for the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.

961
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:08,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Replay as the son of Spider-Man in 2064 using spider powers and future tech to battle villains.

962
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:12,929
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Spider-Man New Heights for the 360 PS3 and the Wii.

963
01:09:13,009 --> 01:09:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Upgrades Spidey's abilities as he moves from battling low-level gangs to famous foes in the New York skyline.

964
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man Gangs of New York.

965
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, seriously.

966
01:09:26,177 --> 01:09:30,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Gangs take over the whole city and Spider-Man must pit them against each other.

967
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:40,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man Adaption Spidey travels all over the globe from Tokyo to Paris to Moscow to take out foes.

968
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:42,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel Team-Up Spider-Man meets X-Men.

969
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:44,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was the one I was talking about earlier.

970
01:09:44,523 --> 01:09:47,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man Contest of Champions 360, PS3, and Wii.

971
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:52,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Destructible Fighter for 2-4 players with Spider-Man, Venom, Wolverine, Electro...

972
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:56,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Electro, Doc Ock, Carnage, and the Green Goblin.

973
01:09:56,935 --> 01:09:59,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man Mass Evolution for all three systems.

974
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:06,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Spidey skills from strength to speed to spidey sense are upgradable as you play.

975
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:07,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man Chaos.

976
01:10:10,242 --> 01:10:30,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Spidey has 8 hours of frenetic action to save from certain doom Spider-Man Tactics, a stealthy and strategic Spidey game Spider-Man Vision, first and third person gameplay Spidey style Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies Spider-Man Webmaster

977
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:44,021
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Wii, a web shooting game for a third person action, Spider-Man Web Slinger, use precision web aiming to target enemies building or build web slingshots and snipe enemies.

978
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:52,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of those are all ideas, but aren't going to come out, because that would be way too much.

979
01:10:53,743 --> 01:11:03,928
[SPEAKER_02]: The avatars, one of the things that people noticed, there were some licensed things with them as well, so maybe some licensed clothing and stuff, you'll be able to get it, because they had one of them with an Incredibles t-shirt.

980
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:07,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds kind of neat.

981
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:08,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

982
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:12,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, um...

983
01:11:13,024 --> 01:11:13,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate Band.

984
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:19,346
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing an Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version, apparently, of the game.

985
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:25,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be, to I'm sure Rob's enjoyment, compatible with Rock Band instruments.

986
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:26,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

987
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii U version, of course, does not have instruments at all.

988
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:34,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually got a video out there for it, too, on how you play it.

989
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:35,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting.

990
01:11:36,353 --> 01:11:36,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

991
01:11:37,816 --> 01:11:38,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

992
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:45,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was also one of the things was the SBGs, which is server-based gaming.

993
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:57,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it's going to be like a social networking blade or something like that that allow you to play games from game shows like Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and other things like that.

994
01:11:58,358 --> 01:11:59,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of interesting.

995
01:12:01,799 --> 01:12:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, Powers and Titans, which is a multiplayer superhero game that's apparently going to be something that Joss Whedon is going to be a part of.

996
01:12:13,282 --> 01:12:13,642
Woohoo!

997
01:12:13,942 --> 01:12:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know what exactly that is, but probably some sort of superhero game.

998
01:12:19,483 --> 01:12:20,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I'm mad at him.

999
01:12:21,084 --> 01:12:21,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1000
01:12:21,464 --> 01:12:21,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1001
01:12:21,864 --> 01:12:23,304
[SPEAKER_10]: For the end of Astonishing X-Men.

1002
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:25,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1003
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:26,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get over it.

1004
01:12:28,426 --> 01:12:29,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, you don't, that, no.

1005
01:12:31,058 --> 01:12:41,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, in unrelated news, you may remember the Wii Fit girl who's been kind of floating around.

1006
01:12:41,946 --> 01:12:44,708
[SPEAKER_02]: She had the YouTube video where she shook her ass while playing Wii Fit.

1007
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:45,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1008
01:12:45,168 --> 01:12:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Playboy's Joe Garcia has put out her own videos that are a little bit more seductive.

1009
01:12:52,353 --> 01:12:53,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Also her playing Wii Fit as well.

1010
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:55,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to cash in on that.

1011
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:55,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

1012
01:12:57,296 --> 01:13:01,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Boy, you know we've moved into a new generation where people are trying to cash in on other people's YouTube videos.

1013
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:02,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amazing.

1014
01:13:04,121 --> 01:13:04,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely amazing.

1015
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:08,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so... Alright, awesome.

1016
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki will review those videos next week on the show.

1017
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's... Well, it didn't look that interesting.

1018
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:19,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't look that interesting?

1019
01:13:19,494 --> 01:13:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't get naked, okay?

1020
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:25,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a Playboy little pictorial thing that she does not get naked.

1021
01:13:25,418 --> 01:13:26,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not approve of that.

1022
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:27,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

1023
01:13:27,739 --> 01:13:31,621
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do approve of people taking it to the next step.

1024
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:32,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1025
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:37,345
[SPEAKER_15]: To which I say, Wii Fit Girl, your rebuttal?

1026
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:46,774
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's going to do it for our last minute stories tonight, I guess we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show and bring another week of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

1027
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:51,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, our sixth anniversary show, if you can believe it.

1028
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:53,899
[SPEAKER_15]: But nothing too special going on.

1029
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:54,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Same old shit we always do.

1030
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully some guests.

1031
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:58,182
[SPEAKER_11]: No one's made any suggestions.

1032
01:13:58,382 --> 01:13:59,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Miglitov will be here next week.

1033
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I should get my husband here.

1034
01:14:01,244 --> 01:14:02,284
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll at least have him.

1035
01:14:02,884 --> 01:14:05,886
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying, by the way, I was trying to get one story we didn't get to tonight.

1036
01:14:05,906 --> 01:14:06,807
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you read this.

1037
01:14:07,727 --> 01:14:13,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you read on the gaming blogs this week about that lady who's running for state senate in Connecticut?

1038
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:19,273
[SPEAKER_15]: And how it's like this big deal like, oh, politicians are getting into games because she has a level 70 in World of Warcraft?

1039
01:14:19,653 --> 01:14:20,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see that story?

1040
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:28,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you thought of this, but the minute I read that, I'm like, what's the big freaking deal?

1041
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:33,465
[SPEAKER_15]: My boyfriend ran for state senate in 2006, and he has two level 70s in Warcraft.

1042
01:14:34,126 --> 01:14:37,128
[SPEAKER_15]: I was actually trying to get him to come to the show tonight, but he didn't want to.

1043
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:39,470
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't know what he'd say.

1044
01:14:40,231 --> 01:14:43,434
[SPEAKER_15]: He was like, what would I talk about if I went on your show?

1045
01:14:43,454 --> 01:14:45,876
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, you play more World of Warcraft than I do.

1046
01:14:45,976 --> 01:14:46,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd fit in fine.

1047
01:14:46,537 --> 01:14:51,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever you see a story like that, you just have to think of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.

1048
01:14:51,601 --> 01:14:51,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hip.

1049
01:14:52,142 --> 01:14:52,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cool.

1050
01:14:57,222 --> 01:14:57,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1051
01:14:57,982 --> 01:14:59,383
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just saying, you know what?

1052
01:14:59,443 --> 01:15:02,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Politicians come in all different flavors, just like regular people.

1053
01:15:02,785 --> 01:15:05,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does it matter what your job is and what you like to do in your spare time?

1054
01:15:05,906 --> 01:15:06,346
[SPEAKER_15]: For real.

1055
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:06,827
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

1056
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:08,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Who the hell cares?

1057
01:15:08,748 --> 01:15:12,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And what relevance does your gaming life have on your political views?

1058
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hold on.

1059
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:13,810
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair.

1060
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,112
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1061
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:44,666
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just don't see what, you know, what you like to do as a hobby.

1062
01:15:45,127 --> 01:15:49,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless, you know, you like to, you know, skin kittens in your backyard or something.

1063
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:50,952
[SPEAKER_01]: As a hobby.

1064
01:15:51,252 --> 01:15:51,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1065
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,814
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but you play video games.

1066
01:15:54,234 --> 01:15:55,055
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the problem?

1067
01:15:55,255 --> 01:15:55,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

1068
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:56,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1069
01:15:56,496 --> 01:16:01,420
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like, you know, I don't care what people's bedroom habits are.

1070
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care what their gaming habits are.

1071
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:08,806
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as long as they're not hurting anybody, what does it matter, right?

1072
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:09,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1073
01:16:09,367 --> 01:16:09,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1074
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,542
[SPEAKER_09]: and people piss me off.

1075
01:16:14,723 --> 01:16:32,279
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, speaking of not caring about what goes on behind closed doors, I do want to say, though, a very happy day tomorrow, Monday, June 15th and going on into June 16th to all the new couples who will be getting married in California who finally, finally have equality.

1076
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:35,122
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so amazing.

1077
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:36,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so happy to live in a state where that's going to be happening.

1078
01:16:36,783 --> 01:16:37,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Until they overrule it again.

1079
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:38,769
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1080
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Not if I have anything to say about it.

1081
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:47,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, did you hear from Amanda about... Um, no.

1082
01:16:47,574 --> 01:16:49,274
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a chapel open up now.

1083
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:51,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Did that actually happen?

1084
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:52,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the website.

1085
01:16:52,556 --> 01:16:54,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the friend was talking about opening one in the Castro.

1086
01:16:54,857 --> 01:16:55,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Did that actually happen?

1087
01:16:55,637 --> 01:16:56,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

1088
01:16:56,498 --> 01:16:57,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1089
01:16:58,099 --> 01:16:58,879
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to get a link from her.

1090
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, that's great if that actually happened, huh?

1091
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:02,507
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

1092
01:17:02,607 --> 01:17:09,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly think that, you know, eventually, and I think that more and more people are realizing this, that what does it matter?

1093
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:17,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and personally, and I've had this discussion with other people before, I actually think that marriage should not be a government thing.

1094
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:19,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Institution, you know what I mean?

1095
01:17:19,316 --> 01:17:21,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thankfully, and boy, we got off the topic of video games.

1096
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:22,798
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

1097
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,039
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's all right.

1098
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:25,800
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a topic that's important to me, so you know what?

1099
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Deal.

1100
01:17:27,962 --> 01:17:33,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Thankfully, the youth of America does not have their head up their ass in this regard.

1101
01:17:33,226 --> 01:17:33,886
[SPEAKER_11]: For the majority?

1102
01:17:34,146 --> 01:17:35,587
[SPEAKER_15]: In this regard, yeah, the majority.

1103
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:38,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I still know people who have their head up their ass.

1104
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:42,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's always going to be somebody with their head up their ass, but it makes me very hopeful for the future.

1105
01:17:42,552 --> 01:17:42,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1106
01:17:42,912 --> 01:17:43,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Very hopeful for the future.

1107
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:46,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, I was going to say one thing.

1108
01:17:46,254 --> 01:17:47,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I missed one last thing.

1109
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:50,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1110
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,099
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually coming from our friends over at Bawani Style.

1111
01:17:53,820 --> 01:18:07,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there was an MTV pack or an advertisement for Rock Band that they were showing a bunch of songs kind of scrolling through the song list and lo and behold, there's a bunch of songs that haven't come out yet in there.

1112
01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:11,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So, four songs that they spotted on there.

1113
01:18:11,952 --> 01:18:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: The Aesthetics of Hate by Machine Head.

1114
01:18:14,573 --> 01:18:36,965
[SPEAKER_02]: uh afterlife by avenge sevenfold which i believe is coming out this next week um breed by nirvana and burn by nine inch nails sweet sounds like fun and i i was gonna say uh i think there's a couple other stories that they had too there was something about like uh new ddr or something like that um also some um

1115
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:39,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatin' Groovy

1116
01:19:02,133 --> 01:19:02,894
[SPEAKER_02]: is what it's called.

1117
01:19:03,374 --> 01:19:06,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an E-rated Konami-published title.

1118
01:19:07,357 --> 01:19:11,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, from the sound of it, it sounds like Konami's rhythm game, of course.

1119
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:18,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It was found on Australia's ratings board webpage.

1120
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:28,495
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also another Xbox 360 title, Domino Master, which is supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1121
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:30,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's Mr. Domino, because that'd be funny.

1122
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:42,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, now that we've had the last, last, last minute stories, let's go ahead and wrap up the show.

1123
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:44,485
[SPEAKER_15]: We got all the final thoughts.

1124
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:46,406
[SPEAKER_15]: We got the last, last minute story.

1125
01:19:46,486 --> 01:19:48,526
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, Ultimate Band has Miley Cyrus in it.

1126
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's a Disney title.

1127
01:19:51,048 --> 01:19:52,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, so I was right.

1128
01:19:52,168 --> 01:19:53,089
[SPEAKER_15]: It has Hannah Montana in it.

1129
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:55,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I have ESPN.

1130
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't Dolly Parton her godmother?

1131
01:20:00,312 --> 01:20:00,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

1132
01:20:01,308 --> 01:20:01,770
[SPEAKER_15]: That's cool.

1133
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:03,057
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Dolly Parton.

1134
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,248
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like Hannah Montana, but I like Dolly Parton.

1135
01:20:06,145 --> 01:20:09,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we get out of here tonight, we have one more thing we wanted to play for you guys.

1136
01:20:10,048 --> 01:20:11,709
[SPEAKER_15]: It came up in the email earlier.

1137
01:20:11,829 --> 01:20:14,571
[SPEAKER_15]: It was what Katamaris Forever emailed us, right?

1138
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:22,917
[SPEAKER_15]: And sent us the parody of Still Alive, but it's featuring the OLR-themed lyrics.

1139
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:25,959
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're actually going to play that for the listeners before we sign off tonight.

1140
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:28,461
[SPEAKER_15]: So here it is, and then we're going to be out of here.

1141
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:33,204
[SPEAKER_15]: So a big thanks to Katamaris Forever and all the fans who got together to make the lyrics.

1142
01:20:33,264 --> 01:20:33,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't wait to hear this.

1143
01:20:34,005 --> 01:20:34,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Here you go.

1144
01:20:34,687 --> 01:20:48,490
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a triumph I'm making a flood here, brah brah brah It's hard to overstate my satisfaction

1145
01:20:50,931 --> 01:21:19,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Launch Radio We podcast the news because we can For the laws in all of us Except the ones who are banned But there's no sense crying over every darn show You just keep on talking till you're out of FU The podcast that's done and she makes a bad pun For the people who are still tuned in

1146
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:48,861

1147
01:21:51,587 --> 01:22:10,084
[SPEAKER_06]: They decayed and Rob gave him a big fat stupid award Now the spears of earth make a beautiful shine The whole thing isn't in the podcast on time But I'm five miles by six, so the podcast's here quick For the people who watch

1149
01:22:38,472 --> 01:22:51,662
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a joke, haha, mono Jamie's eating puss grumpy, but then again it's not me Look at us still singing when there's news to read

1156
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:38,182
