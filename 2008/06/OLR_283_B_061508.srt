4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,320
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,980
And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio, here on All Games Radio,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,440
where we broadcast live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,400
immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show, so sometimes it's a couple minutes early,

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,040
sometimes it's a couple minutes late, as it was tonight.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,920
But that's alright, because we have some great shows that we play with here on All Games Radio,

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,640
not just Bobby on Sunday nights, but a whole sort of assortment of different podcasts

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,480
and other live shows that air throughout the week.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,280
So if you haven't checked it out yet, you definitely should, www.allgames.com.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,400
Meanwhile, we got some other gaming news to get into, and we're gonna get into that in just a minute,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,160
but we gotta follow up with some of that hilarity from the Part A,

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,720
or I guess I shouldn't say hilarity, because somebody is gonna get yelled at

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,320
over all those game news things getting leaked out.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,760
Loke, you were doing some poking around on the website.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,400
What kind of stuff were you looking at there during the break?

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,840
Well, I was just trying to, you know, pull up a bunch of...

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
What's the name of these guys again?

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,960
The Marketing Research...?

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,000
Intellisponse.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
Okay, Intellisponse.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,880
Intellisponse.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,360
But I thought it was funny, though, because they have...

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,840
There was a section on the NeoGAF forum that they were...

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,000
Someone had highlighted their privacy policy, and it's all the policy.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,640
Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,680
We have taken careful measures to secure your information.

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,320
Whoops.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,840
We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from PC to our servers.

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,560
Our secure server software encrypts information,

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,560
ensuring that all internet transactions remain private.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
That's gotta be so embarrassing, though.

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,280
That's gotta be so embarrassing.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
So stupid.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,720
Yeah, they have, like...

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah, it is secure, and it will prompt for a password and stuff like that.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,200
But if you remove part of the URL on that, it won't...

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
So...

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
It's broken.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,960
But...

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Yeah, somebody's gonna get screamed out over that.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
Lots of stuff, and we'll talk about it a little bit more later on.

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,200
I'd be curious to see if this company makes a statement,

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,760
or if they just try to pretend it didn't happen.

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,080
I think they're just gonna pretend it didn't happen,

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,880
and let Microsoft and Activision kind of...

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,280
And all the other marketing research companies today are going,

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Woo-hoo!

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,440
New business is gonna be coming soon.

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,760
Yeah.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,600
Alright, let's stop kicking sand in these guys' faces,

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,840
and go back to gaming news.

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
Yes.

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,880
Alright.

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,520
So, there's some interesting things coming out this week in Japan.

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't really know what you'd call this press event,

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
but it was basically the event where Microsoft says,

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
Hey, look at all the Japanese RPGs that are coming our way.

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,440
So, one of which, of course, is a really cool Star Ocean 4,

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,280
which will be making its way out to the Xbox 360 in 2009.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
It's called Star Ocean The Last Hope,

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
and they had a trailer also being released for that,

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,200
and of course it's Square Enix and Tri-Aces RPG.

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,880
And I guess apparently the game was announced back in 2007

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,360
at the Square Enix party, but, you know, I don't know.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,080
And it was funny, too,

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,600
because originally it was supposed to be a PS3 exclusive,

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,880
but no word yet on when it's gonna arrive on the PS3,

71
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,160
or if it will.

72
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
If it will?

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,720
That's an interesting little footnote.

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,440
Do you think that possibly...

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
Well, I added that, so...

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay.

77
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Well, I mean, this is a Microsoft press event.

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,960
They're not gonna say, oh, it's also on PS3.

79
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
Ah, yes, it makes sense.

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
I think it's still coming to PS3,

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
probably about the same time frame

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
as a lot of these types of games do.

83
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
There's another role-playing game coming out

84
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
called Tales of Vesperia is coming out,

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,600
and it's coming out in Japan in August of 2008,

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
August 7th specifically.

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
And the US, too.

88
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Is it coming out the US the same time?

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Around the same time.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
Around the same time, but we don't have...

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,240
It'll also be mid-August.

92
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,760
Is it really?

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Yeah, so far.

94
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
That wasn't part of this press release.

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you know something I don't?

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
Oh, I know that it's coming out mid-August.

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,480
All right.

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
I don't remember the exact date,

99
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
but it's coming out mid-August.

100
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
It still looks pretty cool.

101
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,640
It's a Namco Bandai RPG,

102
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,360
which I believe Eternal Sonata was by them as well.

103
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,920
And that game was kind of one of those games

104
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
that slipped under some people's radars,

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
but it's great.

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a great game.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
So I'm hoping this game follows in that.

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,280
It's gonna be 37,800 yen for the bundle,

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
because the game is actually gonna get

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
its own Xbox 360 bundle over in Japan

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
to try and tap into that market

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,720
that just won't pick up on Xbox 360.

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,760
The Japanese are really resistant to Xbox 360,

114
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
but trying to use some of these upcoming role-playing games,

115
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,040
which all look pretty rad,

116
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
to try and woo some of the Japanese players

117
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,600
over to Xbox 360.

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
Hasn't worked so far.

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,520
Yeah, and I have a feeling they're all too busy

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
playing Metal Gear Solid 4 to care this week,

121
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
sorry to say.

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Well, another game that...

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,660
But I'll buy it.

124
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Okay.

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,920
Oh, another game that Squenix published

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,400
is actually developed by Tri-Ace for Xbox 360.

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,040
Infinite Undiscovery has ship dates

128
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,840
for North America and Europe,

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,920
being 9.2 and 9.5, respectively,

130
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,200
and proposed in-store dates of September 11th

131
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,880
for Japan and Asia.

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,880
So you can read about it if you read Japanese on Famitsu.

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,840
Oh, by the way, this was like my favorite

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
out of all those role-playing games I saw,

135
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,480
this Infinite Undiscovery.

136
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
This looks pretty sweet.

137
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
And the name is very interesting.

138
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,920
It's really weird that we're getting it before Japan.

139
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
It's shipping on that day.

140
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
But, well, it's so gonna be there next day.

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll still be able to walk into a store

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
and get it before the Japanese listener person,

143
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,760
which is strange because with role-playing games,

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,600
I can't think of many times that happens.

145
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,480
So, but that's, I mean, it's not that much.

146
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
It's only like a week.

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
But I think it's pretty cool.

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
They at least obviously develop the games at the same time.

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,240
Yes.

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,040
Pretty neat.

151
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
And then the last game, of course,

152
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
which we've seen a little bit of trailers on,

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
I think during E3 and maybe Tokyo Game Show.

154
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,320
I don't remember.

155
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,400
But the last title, of course,

156
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
The Last Remnant will be getting an Xbox 360 release.

157
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,760
This is the one that's using the Unreal 3 engine

158
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,200
that was first announced in 2007.

159
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,520
And the game is supposed to be, I guess,

160
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
supposed to be launching simultaneously

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,320
on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan,

162
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,360
North America and Europe, I guess, a little bit later.

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
But now it looks like they're gonna get

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,280
a simultaneous worldwide launch in all three territories.

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
So it's supposed to come sometime this winter.

166
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,800
Interesting.

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Interesting, so coming soon is basically what they've said.

168
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:00,960
The fall.

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,240
Interesting.

170
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
Hey, I'm actually curious because I

171
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
know a lot of our listeners are into these RPG-type games

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
because we are.

173
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm kind of curious, chat room, out of these games

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,320
we just talked about, Star Ocean, Tales of Vesperia,

175
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
Infinite Undiscovery, Last Remnant,

176
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,120
is there any that, and kind of including other RPGs

177
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
we know are in the tailpipe for Xbox 360,

178
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,440
such as Blue Dragon 2, I think, has been confirmed,

179
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
as well as the Lost Odyssey sequel.

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm kind of curious, those of you guys in chat,

181
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
are any of these catching your interest?

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
And if so, which one?

183
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
And why?

184
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
Which one do you think you're more interested in

185
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,680
over the others?

186
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
I already have Infinite Undiscovery on order,

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
same with Tales.

188
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,440
And then there's also the PS3 Sega one

189
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
that's coming out that I can't remember the name off

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
the top of my head right now.

191
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,200
But that one I also have on order.

192
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,280
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you

193
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
want to join in on the instant discussion there.

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,760
If you're listening live to us on this Sunday evening.

195
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,840
As well as five copies of Saints Row 2

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,160
for each one of our Xbox 360s.

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,660
Nice.

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,640
We'll move, we'll move.

199
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,140
Huh?

200
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,000
You asked a question of us.

201
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, I was asking chat, but certainly

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
if you have an opinion too, please.

203
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm sort of thinking that Infinite Undiscovery,

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
but it depends on if I have time.

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,200
Always depends on time.

206
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,700
That's all right.

207
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,720
We'll go back to that question in just a minute.

208
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
Let me address this though related to Xbox stories.

209
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,280
Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

210
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,360
The Xbox Live Arcade game with the longest freaking title ever.

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,800
You know it's going into beta.

212
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,760
And the beta was purchased through Commando 3,

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,160
which just went on Xbox Live Arcade this past week.

214
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
That beta is going to open up on June 25th.

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,280
That would be next Wednesday is when

216
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,560
this beta is going to go live.

217
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
Now remember about the beta though,

218
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
you only basically get Ken Ryu in one stage.

219
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,840
So it's not really a whole lot to the game.

220
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,640
But hey, at least you do get to take a peek

221
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
at what this game is going to look like.

222
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,520
So again, that all starts on June 25th.

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
Going to the question that I asked earlier,

224
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
looking in chat at some of the answers here.

225
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,880
Let's see.

226
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
Joshi16 says, I don't have the time anymore.

227
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
I want to try Eternal Sonata.

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
I'm so behind.

229
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm behind on a lot of these games

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,560
too.

231
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,120
Damn wow.

232
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,520
GameGuru says, OLR, not really.

233
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Maybe the Blue Dragon games because Blue Dragon

234
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
is from Team Chrono Trigger.

235
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,280
I got to tell you though, the first Blue Dragon game,

236
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,560
not what you would have hoped for.

237
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
It's OK.

238
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,440
It's like imagine like a Super Nintendo classic RPG

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
on an Xbox 360.

240
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,400
That's kind of what Blue Dragon was.

241
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,440
But unfortunately, the story was a little generic

242
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
as a lot of RPGs tended to be back then.

243
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,960
So sorry.

244
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,040
All right, that was really it.

245
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,960
We didn't get a whole lot of comments on that in chat.

246
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,200
Ospher says he wants to get a Eternal Sonata for PS3.

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
I guess they do have the extra stuff.

248
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,520
So we'll see.

249
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,880
I wish I hadn't looked at this.

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
I really wish I hadn't looked at this.

251
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Well, what's that?

252
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm not going to spoil it for anybody else at all.

253
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
And actually, this really isn't that bad of a spoiler.

254
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
But I'm still not going to say anything about it

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,400
because there is a voice acting casting call out

256
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
for a second Portal game.

257
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm not going to say anything about it.

258
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,400
So we don't know what it is or why.

259
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
It's just it's out there.

260
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,920
I know why.

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,880
I know what it is now.

262
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
But it's a spoilery.

263
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
I don't want to spoil it for anybody.

264
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,080
All right.

265
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,320
If you want to know, you can actually hunt it down on a...

266
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm not in most gaming blogs around the story this week.

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,200
But I'm not sure.

268
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,520
I'm not going to ruin it.

269
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,440
I got to say, though, that the premise sounds awesome.

270
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,240
From what I read of it, it sounds very interesting.

271
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
You knew it was coming.

272
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,960
You knew a Portal 2 had to happen somehow.

273
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,480
So I'm glad they will make it work one way or the other.

274
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,840
We'll see.

275
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,680
All right.

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,880
Anyways, so there's some interesting stuff coming out.

277
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
Now, probably from a very unlikely event as well.

278
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,400
The Major League of Gaming, they actually had a Halo 3 competition that's happened recently.

279
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,320
And one of the surprises that they had for their contestants was a new map for Halo 3

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
called Cold Storage.

281
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:34,720
And what Cold Storage is, is actually a remake or, I guess, a map that resembles the Chill

282
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
Out level from the first Halo games.

283
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,800
So it's kind of interesting.

284
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,560
It kind of falls in line with, you know, the other maps that have been released.

285
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,960
Kind of a lot of remakes and that, I guess, inspired by previous game maps and stuff like

286
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,360
that.

287
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,920
So no word on when this will be coming to us, but probably something like in the fall

288
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,400
or summer, you know, another map pack.

289
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,400
But pretty cool.

290
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,560
All right.

291
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,960
Sounds interesting.

292
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,600
Although, I'm kind of over Halo 3.

293
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,280
I don't know about the rest of y'all.

294
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,040
But Halo 3 didn't have the lasting power that Halo 2 did, sadly.

295
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,880
I don't know.

296
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,680
All right.

297
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,200
The Maw is a new game that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

298
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
And I don't know, the first time I look at this and I see this little creature in a little

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,400
screenshot from the Maw, I think it's like something I see out of Spore or something.

300
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,160
But actually, what Maw is, is that is kind of the little mouth creature on a pet blob

301
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,440
that is featured in the game.

302
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,080
You can actually use this little creature to eat, like, a house or just lots of little

303
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,560
different things.

304
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,880
I don't know.

305
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
It kind of sounds different, like Katamari Dimashius in a way.

306
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
It's a little alien, Frank.

307
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,640
And you use the Maw's growth and the power's M-A-W.

308
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,360
Thought so.

309
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,860
Yeah.

310
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,960
And basically, what you do, you say hello to creatures, then eat them.

311
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,560
And they double as power ups.

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
Twisted Pixel is the people behind the game.

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,480
And they promise that they will have a lengthy single player mode, cut scenes that are described

314
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,840
as intense, and cutting edge graphics for Xbox Live Arcade.

315
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
No word on when this will be out.

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,520
Hopefully a little sooner than Castle Crashers.

317
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,360
We'll see.

318
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,720
Meanwhile, let's take a look at what you guys have to say in our mailbag.

319
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,240
Every week we open up our mailbag to you guys to send us your emails and your love and adoration

320
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
or your hate mail.

321
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,240
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

322
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
Darkstalker's going to dive in right now.

323
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
Pick a few of her favorites.

324
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,680
Read them for you.

325
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,000
We got a bunch of them, but they're not that long.

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,500
OK.

327
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,480
First one comes from, I'm just going to say James.

328
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,640
Is there a date on how long Deoxys is available?

329
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm in Germany, and my cartridge is in Texas to get the event item for Darkrai.

330
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,840
So, I may need to ask someone to take the cartridge to Gamestop.

331
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Um, I didn't see.

332
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,240
I don't remember seeing one either.

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,960
I will try to find the answer for the reason next to the email.

334
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,280
You may have to get a friend over here to get it for you or something somehow.

335
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,200
This one comes from our friend in Kenya.

336
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
Hi, O.R. I've been listening to tonight's show and I'm thrilled you read my email.

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,560
Wait, no.

338
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
This guy's fake.

339
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,920
I proved it.

340
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,920
He's on our Facebook community.

341
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,520
OK. The actual name that emailed us.

342
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,560
I got you.

343
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
I caught you.

344
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,960
So, now I want to know what the hell, what is this?

345
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,920
Go ahead and read the email.

346
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,480
I'm going to read it.

347
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
That's what I said because I'm, you know.

348
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,480
All right.

349
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,080
It's like, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to prove who I am, but I will try and find a

350
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,280
way to get a hold of the camera to take a picture of Samara's Cafe.

351
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,560
Have a good night there in the USA from Kenya.

352
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,440
That's from Taiwan.

353
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
I just want to know, what the hell is this?

354
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
Just come clean.

355
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,680
I caught you.

356
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
You're, you're, the name in your email is in our Facebook community.

357
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,920
You got caught.

358
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
Now admit it.

359
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,280
All right.

360
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,920
Next email.

361
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
But I still want to see the picture.

362
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
I mean, I kind of want to see what you, what we're going to do.

363
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,520
I mean, I, I, I, I don't have a, this one comes from the guy with cool email.

364
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,000
Salt-Tec.

365
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,920
Just wondering if any of you know whether Sony ever plans to let you play PSP games

366
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
using your PS3 via remote play.

367
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
I hate the PSP's control, but it seems all the games I like are coming out for it, i.e.

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,880
Kingdom Hearts 3, God of War 3, Final Fantasy 7.

369
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,400
It just seems like it would be smart because it's only, only take an update to do.

370
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,560
And I know personally that a few of my friends would pick up both the PS3 and PSP just to

371
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,640
do this and the others, since they already have a PS3, would just buy the PSP.

372
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,760
He means Crisis Core.

373
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,720
That's what I meant.

374
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,040
Yeah.

375
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,840
That's what I was thinking.

376
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
Awesome show, never let it stop.

377
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,040
Salt-Tec.

378
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,960
Awesome show, never let it stop, Salt-Tec.

379
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:49,840
Okay.

380
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,080
So, wait, wait, was the question, should he get the PSP or?

381
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,560
If they're ever gonna have the remote play.

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Oh, remote play on PSP.

383
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
I thought they already had something like that.

384
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,160
I think he's talking about in the other direction where you can play PSP games on your PS3.

385
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,680
Oh, um, maybe someday.

386
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
You know what would be a little bit better is, well,

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,000
I guess you could emulate it, but like, that'd be kind of cool.

388
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,200
They have a little $20 peripheral or something like that that just pop the UMD into and play

389
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,680
it that way.

390
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Well, here's, here's the other thing on those new PSPs.

391
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,960
They have the video out, which is essentially playing them on your TV anyway.

392
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
That's not exactly.

393
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
The complaint was about the controller.

394
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,600
I can understand that and maybe Sony will do that whole like compatibility and reverse

395
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,400
thing, but because of the video out and because Sony doesn't feel that their controller sucks,

396
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
don't hold your breath.

397
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,640
Sorry, by the way, I'm looking at a story about that Pokemon event to go back to the

398
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,200
last email.

399
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,480
It says that it's only on the weekends of June 20th and June 27th.

400
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm sorry to say June 30th, I think is the last day that this is available.

401
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,000
So sorry to our friend in Germany.

402
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You'll have to get somebody over here to get it for you.

403
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Quick FedEx your cartridge out here or find a cheat code or something.

404
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
Yeah, sorry.

405
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
Um, this comes from Geek Boy.

406
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,680
Hey, OLR crew, I've been looking unsuccessfully for free lessons in programming languages.

407
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,520
I've wanted to learn how to learn programming languages for some time now, and I wanted

408
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
to know if you knew any good websites and which languages I should learn.

409
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,040
Thanks, Geek Boy.

410
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,240
Well, you can learn to learn anything, I suppose.

411
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,160
But if you want to start off, you know, easy, try something like, you know, Visual Basic,

412
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,680
maybe because you can use that in Word and all kinds of other programs.

413
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,160
You know what?

414
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,800
If you ain't writing in ZZT, you ain't shit.

415
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,480
I'm just kidding.

416
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
No, you need to learn Fortran.

417
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,760
Jeez, Pascal.

418
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,480
How about Logo?

419
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
No, just kidding.

420
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,520
You know, here's the thing.

421
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,120
Honestly, if you really want to start with programming, like if you don't even really

422
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,920
have your foot, because he says he doesn't really have his foot in the door at all.

423
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,160
I don't like free C. Well, not even that, but my suggestion go to one of these games

424
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
that is a make your own game.

425
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,040
And even though I kind of joke about ZZT, that game will teach you a lot about programming,

426
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,480
even though it's like years old.

427
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
And a lot of these games that are game maker type games, it's a really good place to start

428
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,280
because programming and all that is a lot about logic and a way of thinking and debugging

429
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,840
your stuff.

430
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,200
I know it's logical.

431
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,240
I hey, look, when I originally went to college, I was studying originally like computer programming

432
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
and I started with a C++ class.

433
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,680
I hated it.

434
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,440
And I decided this is not for me.

435
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,600
I quit database management because as soon as I went through the basic stuff, I was like,

436
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,160
I hate this.

437
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,840
There's a lot of people in chat yelling C++, Java, C, basic.

438
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,760
I would say honestly, I don't know who uses basic anymore, but why not?

439
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
But here's the thing.

440
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,920
Start with one of these game maker type programs that teach you how to think logically and

441
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,280
debug your games.

442
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
Then you're ready to start with a programming language.

443
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,240
Think about it.

444
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,040
And seriously, check out ZZT.

445
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,520
It rocks.

446
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,560
Xenocore says turn him to game maker seven.

447
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,320
Make a game while you learn coding techniques.

448
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
That's exactly the kind of thing I'm thinking is a good starting point because if you try

449
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,040
to just jump in and learn C, you're going to be in over your head, buddy.

450
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,720
Yeah, you've got to have the, you always build up to whatever.

451
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,120
Yeah.

452
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,160
And Alpha Canagram says TI-83 basic for the win.

453
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Hell yeah, I had one.

454
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
I had the Texas Instruments computer that had the little cartridges that you slid on

455
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,800
the side.

456
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,560
And I had the basic book.

457
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,080
I will write you a Commodore 64 basic program right now.

458
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,560
Here we go.

459
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,440
10 space, print space, quote, Rob is awesome, quote, enter.

460
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,520
20 space, go to 10, enter, run.

461
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,560
Programming lesson here on OLR.

462
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,920
Make sure you've got plenty of printer paper.

463
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,200
Exactly.

464
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
You know, I have that icon, though.

465
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,560
Did you see my icon that I made a long time ago?

466
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080
This is a 10 home.

467
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,360
Yes, sweet home.

468
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
30 go to 10.

469
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,960
Yeah, I remember that.

470
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,460
Yeah.

471
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,160
Anyway, this one comes from Katamari's Forever.

472
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,560
First of all, I want to thank you, OLR, for naming Space Channel 5 your classic game of

473
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,520
the week last week.

474
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,680
I was beaming with excitement when Jamie said those words.

475
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,160
I actually thank Sauce for that because she's the one who told me to do it.

476
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,040
Thank you, Sauce.

477
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,520
Thank you.

478
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
Even though you're not listening to us to watch Tony Awards.

479
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
She didn't hear that now because she's watching Tony Awards.

480
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,760
Second, I want to give a shout out to an OLR me, Carizzle.

481
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
It's nice that I found him on another forum, Red Flag Deals.

482
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
Do you get excited when you see a random OLR me around an event?

483
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,540
Yeah.

484
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:06,720
And by the way, this reminds me, I finally got around to making a character on the Ragnarok

485
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,880
server that you have to guess which one I'm playing on.

486
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
Named Dark Sakura with the party OLR me.

487
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
So if you find me, you get a prize.

488
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm not going to tell you where I am, though.

489
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Nice.

490
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
Only a few people know.

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,040
And third, remember when someone nuked your article from Wikipedia?

492
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,960
I was laughing out loud when I found out that under the beautiful Katamari article was none

493
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,280
other than you, OLR, when the article referenced the story you posted about the game.

494
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,160
I guess you're in place.

495
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh, yeah, that.

496
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
I guess you're in places you think you're not in.

497
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,280
Anyway, wanted to say I'm playing Space Channel 5 Part 2 now and talk to you later.

498
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,480
Katamari's forever.

499
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,980
Hey, yes.

500
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,720
Go ahead.

501
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,360
Rob.

502
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,860
What?

503
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
Remember that Still Alive parody thread?

504
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,880
Well, I finished the song and put it on this email.

505
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,360
Please listen.

506
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,920
It would be greatly appreciated or maybe put in a bonus segment.

507
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,360
How about we make that our fortune cookie?

508
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,480
We or well, better yet was so the podcast listeners can hear it.

509
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,240
We will play at the end of the show tonight because I did listen to it.

510
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,320
I can't believe somebody actually did it.

511
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
So we will definitely play it at the end of the show and you rock for doing it.

512
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
Here's what I want to ask about Wikipedia.

513
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
You know, not only were we linked from that beautiful Katamari article,

514
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,040
we were also linked from the Guitar Hero 80s edition article.

515
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,280
I don't even remember why what we had to do with that game.

516
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,400
I guess we were.

517
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,920
Did we announce it early or something?

518
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I don't remember Guitar Hero 80s edition.

519
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,760
What about 80s edition?

520
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,160
We're linked from the article in Wikipedia.

521
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,320
Like, for some reason, we're referenced in the article.

522
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,040
I don't remember why.

523
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,960
I think we may talk about it or whatever.

524
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,460
Whatever.

525
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,040
Here's my question.

526
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,840
Did anyone ever try to recreate the wiki article?

527
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,720
They should.

528
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,760
I think so, too.

529
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,400
The problem, the reason why it got nuked is because they said it wasn't sourced or that

530
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,560
it didn't prove its relevance or whatever.

531
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,320
But dude, we're coming up on our sixth birthday.

532
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,600
We're gonna be like one of the longest running shows on the net, right?

533
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,240
Right.

534
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,080
Oh, you're giving me a second, yep, I found it.

535
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,960
It's under history.

536
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,080
Guitar Hero Encore Rock C80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar

537
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Hero 1980s edition.

538
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an

539
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,960
Activision announcement, though no other source has cited this announcement.

540
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,480
Activision officially revealed the first details of the game as May 11th, 2007, in addition

541
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,760
to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rock C80s.

542
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,640
I rem- you know what, it never came out, though, in that time.

543
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,920
I remember what it was, though.

544
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,560
It was some type of, like, sales presentation thing that you- that you had that we- I remember

545
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,120
that's what it was.

546
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,320
That's why no one else would have had it.

547
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,760
Yeah.

548
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
It was from, uh, I remember what it was from.

549
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,560
It was from, uh, Destination PlayStation because that's, uh, it's retailers only.

550
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,040
No press.

551
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,320
Uh-huh.

552
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,400
This one goes for the World of Warcraft players.

553
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,600
Yay!

554
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,440
From Lord Katakos.

555
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,320
What server you guys play WoW on?

556
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,920
Also, my 77 priest I mailed you about, like, two months ago was hacked, but I restarted

557
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,280
on a private server called D- Dagon MS, I guess, and I'm now level 168.

558
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,760
Wait, you can't be that high in WoW.

559
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,560
Are you sure this is about WoW, or is this, uh, R- uh, Ragnarok?

560
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
Can you go to 168?

561
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,680
No, maybe it is.

562
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,960
No, this is what you play WoW on.

563
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,360
You can't go to level 168 in WoW.

564
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,860
Private server?

565
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,940
Maybe on a private server.

566
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,580
That's what he just said.

567
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,620
He's playing on a private server.

568
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,420
Oh.

569
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,100
I'm gonna look this- the server up.

570
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
Um, anyway, you guys are gladly set to rob.

571
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,220
He only just finished Khara.

572
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,540
Um, I would- I- we- I'm on the Ravencrest server on normal OLR.

573
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,060
I don't play on a pirated server.

574
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,220
Um, I play on Ravencrest because it sounds like Ravenclaw from Harry Potter.

575
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,780
Horde side.

576
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,900
Horde has cookies.

577
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,540
Okay, I looked up, uh, Dagon MS, and it's a freaking, um, um, MapleStory.

578
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,780
MapleStory?

579
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,340
Get out of here!

580
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm just kidding.

581
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,940
Jamie doesn't play MapleStory.

582
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,440
The end.

583
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,220
Help me don't play that.

584
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,420
And, um, by the way, the, um, uh, OL Army Guild on WoW really isn't the OL Army Guild

585
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,060
on WoW anymore.

586
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,660
It's like, uh, Rob's offline friends and their friends playing in a guild.

587
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,660
So, if you're going to join our guild, I'm all for having listeners in there because

588
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,620
we still go by the, uh, OL Army creative, uh, don't be an asshole when you play games.

589
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,460
But, um, you know, don't expect that you're going to run into a whole lot of other OLR

590
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,180
listeners on there.

591
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,300
But we have fun.

592
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,940
If any- if anyone wants to find out, wants to, um, and it's only going to be a casual

593
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,380
guild, I'm not going to let anyone else invite anyone who- unless I trust them.

594
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,460
But, um, find me on, um, uh, what is that chat thing we use?

595
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,340
IRC.

596
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,980
There you go.

597
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,340
And, um, I might tell you.

598
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,300
Um, I want to point out, too, because this is in the Justin TV chat, going back to the,

599
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,780
uh, kid who was asking about the programming languages, wanting to know more about where

600
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,820
to start with that.

601
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,420
Um, Akuma JP, who works for, like, you know, game companies in Japan, suggests, download

602
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
the iPhone SDK.

603
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,060
It's fun.

604
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,940
Start from there.

605
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,660
Not C, though.

606
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,340
I didn't even think about that.

607
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,500
There's that whole new, uh, development kit that iPhones got.

608
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
I might get the Twitter thingy for it.

609
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,500
That might be kind of fun.

610
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,260
Good suggestion.

611
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,180
It's actually officially supported now.

612
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,820
Hmm.

613
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,980
Okay, next email from Amplitude.

614
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,860
Yes, please.

615
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,620
Hey, OLR, Amplitude here.

616
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,260
I'm listening to part B of this week's show at work, and the whole tangent on how awesome

617
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,940
arcades used to really, uh, be really got me to start thinking.

618
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,860
We, or at least those of us from that era, certainly can name some arcades that are on

619
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,140
the decline, and what happened, but reminiscing will only get us so far.

620
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,660
I feel like we never quite found an explanation for this.

621
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,580
Can we point fingers at corporate America and say that things were brought, um, were

622
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,980
bought out and consequently ambushed?

623
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,100
But is anyone else looking at it from a different perspective?

624
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,060
What about the kids that go to the arcades or lack thereof?

625
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,660
Nowadays, if you were spotted at a local arcade, you're pegged as a gamer, and all the

626
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,500
stereotypes are realized, and you begin to accumulate what can only be described as

627
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,140
loser points.

628
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,220
I don't know about you, but I remember when going to the arcade with your friends was

629
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,100
the cool thing to do.

630
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,060
I guess my main point is that while arcades have gone downhill because of buyouts, no

631
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,500
one goes to them anymore, and perhaps that's the reason why they're losing interest in

632
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,220
being shut down.

633
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,100
Sorry for the long email slash rant amplitude.

634
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,420
P.S.

635
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,180
This email brought to you by subject hometown here, home of the test subject here.

636
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,780
Um, I see what you did there.

637
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,300
Uh, good thought.

638
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,580
I, I don't know.

639
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,100
I don't think we ever did get down to the bottom of what happened to arcades, and I,

640
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
there was money to be made in birthday parties.

641
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,900
Maybe we should do our first investigative story.

642
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,220
An invest, an OLR investigative report.

643
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,700
Don't don't.

644
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,740
Seriously.

645
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,380
Maybe.

646
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,940
We should.

647
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,420
Okay, Jamie, you head that up because I wouldn't even know where to begin to college and works

648
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,220
full time.

649
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,180
Rob works full time and Rob has other things going on too.

650
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,500
Okay.

651
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,500
You know, so don't you were full time and is very busy with other things.

652
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,060
You're not me.

653
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,500
Get on that.

654
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,620
All right.

655
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
There's a shiny dollar in it for you.

656
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,340
I have a Susan B with your name on it, but, but I do want to one part of the email said

657
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,580
people don't go because they're afraid of being a nerd.

658
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,700
Uh, no, no, that can't be true of people.

659
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,540
People are dorks because they go to arcades.

660
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,100
I can't believe that's true.

661
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,340
Loki Jamie and Loki Jamie and I would never have met if it wasn't for the arcade.

662
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,300
I don't, of course, you know, then again, I got called a geek earlier this week, so

663
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,980
I don't know by some guy who doesn't know you.

664
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,900
I know I'm just being a bitch, but seriously, you know, it's like, I don't the hell with

665
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,860
what they think.

666
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,020
So what if they think you're a cheeseburger points out for programming languages, PHP,

667
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,420
Python, C++, Java, Ruby, Pearl, and if you learn HTML, it will be easier.

668
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,180
Like, okay, HTML is freaking easy.

669
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,300
So we're almost done.

670
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,700
Great.

671
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:48,900
Hello.

672
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,540
All right.

673
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,860
It is Janai from Las Vegas.

674
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,780
As of typing this email, I have returned from the video game live concert in Henderson,

675
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,500
Nevada.

676
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,100
It is a must see event.

677
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,460
I wore my Professor Layton costume and gave people gold coins that noticed who I was dressed

678
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,860
as.

679
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,360
Nice.

680
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,900
I was backstage for the costume contest, and even though I didn't win, I got to see Martin

681
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,380
Leung, the famous piano player who played the Super Mario theme blindfolded on YouTube.

682
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,740
I quickly said, I love your YouTube videos and you applied with a cool thank you.

683
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,540
And that made my day.

684
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,380
Awesome lighting, great music selection, both new and classic games.

685
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,500
And Tommy Tallarico kept changing his clothes, which was strange.

686
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,620
I give the show a solid 100% rating.

687
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,180
If it's coming to your town or close by, you must see it.

688
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,260
And yes, they have international dates this year.

689
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,380
You know, I'm really glad you read that email because it gives me a chance to say we have

690
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,260
a guest coming on the show, not next week, but the week after.

691
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,460
He's going to be on the show on the 29th, Sunday, the 29th.

692
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,780
Tommy Tallarico is going to be on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live.

693
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,820
And I will ask him for you about why the wardrobe change.

694
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,900
So, yeah, and we're going to, we're going to be asking him about the world tour and,

695
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,460
uh, you know, what, what people can expect this year and all that fun stuff.

696
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,940
And then all expenses paid tickets to see it overseas.

697
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:07,300
Uh, I don't push it, but I know Tommy Tallarico will be here in two weeks.

698
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,800
Sweet.

699
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,540
Cheeseburger.

700
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,620
I'm not reading your other email, but I'll read this one.

701
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,860
It's about arcades.

702
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,220
Hey guys, last week you talked about arcades and how cool they were.

703
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,180
I am 14, so I've never really been in arcades.

704
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,660
Sky said we have cool things in our generation, but we won't realize them until 20 years from now.

705
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,660
I think we'll be telling our kids about this thing called internet radio, where everyone had a voice.

706
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,100
At least I got some OLR.

707
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,980
You know, that's a cute email.

708
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,620
That is cute.

709
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,940
It is a very good, nice email.

710
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,020
Last one.

711
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,500
Yes.

712
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,940
By the way, just to answer the questions in chat, Tommy will not actually be here in studio

713
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,340
because, you know, he has this whole video games live thing going on.

714
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,460
He's also trying to do, um, he's going to be here in two weeks.

715
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,860
Live thing going on, he's also trying to do, um, but he will take a little time to plug it on our show.

716
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,180
Yes.

717
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,820
Last one comes from our very good friend.

718
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,380
Vandalous.

719
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,380
Hooray.

720
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,940
Miss you.

721
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,660
Happy father's day.

722
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,140
Vandalous.

723
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,420
Happy father's day.

724
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,900
He's got, I think I lost count.

725
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,540
I have lost count of how many children Vandalous has.

726
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,180
I think five.

727
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,300
Yeah.

728
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,100
It's at least five.

729
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,540
Happy father's day.

730
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,740
You've earned it.

731
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,460
Yes, you have.

732
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,260
Quite a bit.

733
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,500
Several times over and we miss you.

734
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,380
We really miss you.

735
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,420
Come back and visit us soon.

736
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,300
Mm hmm.

737
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,820
Um, he says, um, Hey gang, it's, uh, Terry slash Vandalous.

738
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,500
Um, I hope you're all doing well.

739
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,020
I wanted to pass on a new story.

740
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:33,300
I just blogged about in my weekend news job at www.hardocp.com.

741
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,540
Yeah.

742
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,260
Hard OCP.

743
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,540
Um, it's about the U S army's new recruitment tactic, um, interactive centers.

744
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,780
And he sent me a link to it.

745
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,340
Um, and, but he continues with full-size mockups, Apache helicopter simulations.

746
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,180
Look like America's army was just the beginning and tells us to take care.

747
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,860
And actually, yeah, what it is, is, um, excuse me, they're having a recruitment center set

748
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,700
up with simulators for full-scale, um, mockups of equipment and a gaming arena that uses,

749
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,540
um, America's army.

750
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:11,940
Um, so that instead of doing the whole, having a commercial to sell what you might happen,

751
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,300
they actually have something that in fact is even quoted, um, from a major Larry Dillard,

752
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,020
who's, um, a U S army marketing executive.

753
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,900
He said the, um, the modeling command and control systems are like those used in Iraq.

754
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,380
Um, they said, there's a, like we said earlier, there's an Apache simulator, um, for pilot

755
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,900
and co-pilot, um, that uses the flight and weapon system, a black Hawk helicopter, um,

756
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,180
that has four door gunner positions and, um, uh, armored Humvee vehicle simulator.

757
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,740
So I think that's pretty, actually, I kind of want to do that myself.

758
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,020
Humvee simulator.

759
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,500
Yeah.

760
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,100
With, um, turrets and that type of thing.

761
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
It's, it just makes me think of that.

762
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,100
What was that?

763
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,380
You know, the army is innovative.

764
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,220
They're very innovative at this stuff.

765
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,940
They do their job.

766
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,060
Well, that's all I can really say.

767
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,340
Smart, smart folks there.

768
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,380
And they're using that wonderful America's army.

769
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,700
Wait, whatever happened to America's army?

770
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,820
I think it's, oh yeah, that's right.

771
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,340
That game sucks.

772
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,700
Is it still going?

773
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,780
It's got, it's got a cult following to it.

774
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:15,940
All right.

775
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,140
That it for mailbag?

776
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,460
Yes.

777
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,140
Mailbag orange lounge, radio.com.

778
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,100
Let's get back to some news.

779
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,620
Yes.

780
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,540
And this is kind of funny though.

781
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,420
Um, apparently there is a game.

782
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:34,980
Someone noticed that's reusing oblivion's graphics and, uh, the game itself was called

783
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:42,580
uh, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds weird anyways, and it is blatantly ripping off Elder

784
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,380
Scrolls Oblivion.

785
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,580
In fact, they had a screenshot, um, comparison and yeah, it's near identical except for maybe

786
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,980
the fire effects are shittier than the other game.

787
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:01,460
Um, no word, uh, uh, no word on what else, um, they may have stolen.

788
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,540
Um, it says, uh, apparently also, oh, there are some updates to the story.

789
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,340
Apparently also, um, they stole an environment from Thief Deadly Shadows as well.

790
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,780
And, um, apparently Joystick just heard back from the US publisher Try Synergy who told

791
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,820
them that the similarities between the two are striking, but we were just as shocked

792
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,100
as anybody else and we put the line into Majestic.

793
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,380
Um, we had no idea that any of this had been happening in, um, the game and things would

794
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,820
have been different if we had known.

795
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,100
And says, wait, Bethesda is making this game themselves?

796
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,380
No, Majestic.

797
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,260
It's Majestic.

798
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,100
The Majestic is the company making the game and it's being published by some company called

799
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,060
Try Synergy.

800
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,140
Well, Majestic actually made a phone call to Bethesda and this is what they had to say.

801
00:34:49,140 --> 00:35:02,580
Anything you can do, I can do better, I can do anything better than you, no you can't, yes I can, no you can, yes I can, no you can, yes I can, yes I can, no, anything you can be.

802
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,620
Except in this case, they actually can't do it that much better.

803
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,180
No, they can't.

804
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,860
And, uh, that's kind of funny though.

805
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,700
I wonder what else they're gonna, um, it says they also think that the game stole some, um,

806
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:22,100
artwork from Diablotube, um, a shield called the Wall of Eyeless or something.

807
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,600
Nice.

808
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,860
Very nice.

809
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,500
So they're stealing from everybody.

810
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Moogan, like a Moogan type game.

811
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,220
Doesn't it?

812
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:34,020
They could do, you know, we should have like random X-type game emulator and then let you

813
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,540
import whatever sprite or whatever the hell you want to do.

814
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,300
Yo, that kind of stuff is like semi-okay if you're making like a fan game or something

815
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,380
like that and maybe like Oblivion or something.

816
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,420
Why don't they just call this game, hi, I stole this from other games?

817
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,860
I don't know.

818
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,180
Azaku says bullshit.

819
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,540
Who the fuck was producing that game in green light at the copyrighted textures without

820
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,420
consulting a lawyer?

821
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,600
Hmm.

822
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,340
Is it bullshit?

823
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,780
Or is it the real deal?

824
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,300
Only time will tell.

825
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,660
Meanwhile, let's go back to some more gaming news.

826
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,020
In the law world, two guys are suing EA.

827
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,340
Hey, why would they sue EA?

828
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:21,060
Well, it has to do with the NFL lockout, basically, that EA has put on everybody else because

829
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,180
they have the rights.

830
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,540
They've actually filed the suit in a Northern California court.

831
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,060
It's a class action lawsuit.

832
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,220
And they're saying that because of the NFL license, EA is engaging in, quote, blatantly

833
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,020
anti-competitive conduct and they are seeking, quote, restitution and damages for those who

834
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,900
purchased an EA football game since August of 2005, disgorgement of all profits made

835
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,980
as a result of anti-competitive actions, and that the infringing agreements be declared

836
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,100
null and void.

837
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,260
They're suing the wrong people.

838
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,700
They need to be suing the NFL, not EA.

839
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,980
For signing it in the first place.

840
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:01,620
NFL was the one saying, hey, the rights for our franchise are up for grabs, OK, and then

841
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,540
EA happened to win the bid there.

842
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:09,220
It's NFL's fault and not EA as much as I hate to say that.

843
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,140
And for those of you that don't understand legal translation so much, we actually had

844
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,380
somebody try to simplify this lawsuit for us and they translated it for us.

845
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,860
Here it is.

846
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,340
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

847
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,220
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

848
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,300
There it is.

849
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,580
That's what this lawsuit is all about.

850
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,500
Anyhow, stories like this, I don't know about you guys, but whenever I hear about all these

851
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,900
like type of like frivolous lawsuit type things, I get a little bit angsty and mad.

852
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,380
And that always necessitates some FUs.

853
00:37:41,380 --> 00:38:02,340
To myself, I left my laptop at home and had to go back and get it.

854
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:14,100
All right, Loki, FUs is the guy in front of me at Burger King, because apparently he didn't

855
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,700
know what he wanted to order.

856
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,500
And then he proceeded to order like half the menu because I was waiting behind him for

857
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:26,020
like 10 minutes while he proceeded to wait for his food to be delivered to his car in

858
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
about five to six bags.

859
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,340
Nice.

860
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,420
Yes, I love people.

861
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,380
Oh, and he was smoking right there in front of the end of the window, too.

862
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,260
Nice, which is awesome.

863
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,820
He's a winner.

864
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,500
Um, my FU of the week goes to the root canal I had on Thursday.

865
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,380
Ow.

866
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,420
Root canals are not fun.

867
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,420
An FU to the fact that I think there's a problem with it.

868
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,740
I don't know.

869
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,420
I'm gonna have to see the dentist next week.

870
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,380
FU to dentistry.

871
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,860
That's my FU of the week.

872
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,220
Let's get back to gaming news.

873
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,820
Do we gotta?

874
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,940
We gotta.

875
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,260
Okay.

876
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,260
Um, Penny Arcade.

877
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,100
Cool.

878
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,780
I think.

879
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,980
Nope, I'm wrong.

880
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,460
Oh, did you get ahead of yourself?

881
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,940
Yeah.

882
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,700
Penny Arcade coming up soon.

883
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:11,940
Yes.

884
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,820
Later in the program.

885
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,500
Squeamix.

886
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,300
Yes.

887
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:23,860
Um, there actually is a trailer up for the new MMO concerto gate and it's going to be

888
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,700
a free MMORPG and it's pretty.

889
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:36,660
Um, it's actually the sequel to a cross gate, which was an MMO, um, that was in Japan since

890
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,020
2001 and it's, it's just very cute.

891
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
So I'm going to, I want to give it a try.

892
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,700
Hooray for free and hooray for cute, right?

893
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,220
As long as it's not MapleStory.

894
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,860
All right.

895
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,460
Why all the hate for MapleStory?

896
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,860
I don't know.

897
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,300
I've never even played MapleStory.

898
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,100
It doesn't look fun.

899
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

900
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,460
You know, you may have spoiled Ragnarok online.

901
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,660
Ragnarok has withstood the test of time.

902
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,140
Yeah, sure.

903
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:15,300
One thing Ragnarok does not have that Dungeon Runners does have is a bling gnome.

904
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,580
That's right.

905
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,860
A bling gnome.

906
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,500
What per se is a bling gnome you may ask?

907
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,660
Well, I'm about to tell you.

908
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,700
It's a gnome with bling?

909
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,860
Yeah, sort of.

910
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,620
A bling gnome is a pet of sorts that runs around and picks up, um, all gold dropped

911
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,020
from bad guys while you, um, also kill other things.

912
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:42,420
And, uh, the gnome also will take, um, items or picked up dropped items that aren't rare

913
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,460
and eat them.

914
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,180
Then he poops out gold as a reward.

915
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,860
That's the best thing ever.

916
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,020
I want a gnome that poops gold.

917
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,780
And they have screenshots to back it up.

918
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,300
Yes, the bling gnome who, who set, who either has loot or woot tattooed to his stomach.

919
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,900
I don't know, but, uh, it's kind of funny.

920
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,500
And, uh, for those who may not be familiar with Dungeon Runner, it is a free MMO.

921
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,620
So where can you check this game out if you want to see this, uh, amazing, um, pooping

922
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,260
gnome?

923
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,700
DungeonRunners.com.

924
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,260
Oh, well, I should have been able to figure that one out, huh?

925
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,100
Oh my God, this is the best thing ever.

926
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,860
And he says he does have woot on him.

927
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,020
And he, I think it's loot.

928
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,900
Oh, I thought it says, no, it could be a little of both.

929
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,060
Maybe woot on the front and loot on the back.

930
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:37,460
Maybe it's pooped because he poops out, you know, gold.

931
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,180
Well, um, Hey, who wouldn't want to know that poops out gold?

932
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,980
I mean, that's awesome.

933
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,940
Um, I really don't know how to follow up that story.

934
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:49,940
So I'll just say in other PC gaming news, civilization four is getting a new spinoff.

935
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,420
It's civilization four colonization.

936
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,220
It is not an expansion to the existing civilization four, um, because you're actually not going

937
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,020
to need the original Civ four to actually play this game.

938
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,460
In fact, if you think way back, if you remember old school civilization, like I do the actual

939
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,620
first sequel to civilization of sorts, wasn't civilization two, it was a game called colonization

940
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,940
where you could play as like, I think you played as the British, the French, the Spanish,

941
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,660
or the Dutch.

942
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,420
I want to say, and you could actually play to colonize the new world or America.

943
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,220
No, it wasn't Mars.

944
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,660
You were actually playing Colin.

945
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,420
You were colonizing the new world and it was kind of just a whole like different type of

946
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,580
game, but very similar to the civilization gameplay.

947
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:35,060
Well, basically they're remaking it and putting the Civ four name on it to see if it sells

948
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,100
a little better this time, I suppose, but it's kind of neat that they're going back

949
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,620
and re revisiting it.

950
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,380
So, uh, two K games is, uh, announced this and saying that the game will have all new

951
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,180
graphics, um, I guess that's all new from the previous colonization, cause honestly

952
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,340
it looks like it's just being done in the Civ four engine.

953
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,300
Not that that's a bad thing.

954
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,100
And it's going to have an improved diplomacy system.

955
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,780
So should be pretty interesting.

956
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,420
So check that out.

957
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,860
Civ four colonization.

958
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,020
I'll be very curious to see how that compares to the original.

959
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,180
Maybe it will be fun.

960
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,820
So, um, remember that thing about me seeing penny arcade earlier?

961
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,300
Well, um, here it is.

962
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,100
How's that for like your, you know, tremendous long wait, whatever.

963
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:24,020
Um, the penny arcade game is now available on steam and, um, it's called a penny arcade

964
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,820
adventures on the rain slick precipice of darkness.

965
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:33,780
Episode one is there at www dot steam games.com.

966
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,380
Um, and it will also be offering the future, um, uh, episodes there.

967
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,260
And there are achievements available for steam purchasers.

968
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,660
So, uh, go check it out.

969
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,900
And by the way, the game is very funny.

970
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,300
There's our first review.

971
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,580
You heard it here.

972
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,620
If you haven't heard.

973
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,780
Yeah, you have.

974
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,460
Now, you know, and knowing is half the battle or whatever.

975
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,100
Um, yeah, I hate you.

976
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,460
I hate you too.

977
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,660
Okay.

978
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,340
You know me.

979
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:11,460
You know me well, uh, never when your nights two is getting yet another expansion.

980
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:18,180
Um, the new expansions being called storm of Z her, and it's going to be the second

981
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:24,820
expansion, um, for the game that came out in 2006, it will add a single player campaign

982
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,780
with approximately 15 hours of gameplay.

983
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,340
It'll add a new classes, spells, creatures, and a new playable race.

984
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:38,500
Uh, also there is a new overland map that is being introduced that allow players to

985
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,220
explore, um, the shoot.

986
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,820
It looks like a Chilton peninsula sword coast and, uh, Samarit.

987
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:53,380
And it looks like they also have got, um, Hmm.

988
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,900
Looks like that's pretty much it.

989
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,540
And it's due out, I guess the fourth quarter of this year.

990
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,340
So something around Christmas, perhaps.

991
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,380
Isn't it funny that we started off tonight with the D and D story and now we're ending

992
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,340
with a, you know, game that a lot of D and D players love never winter nights.

993
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,540
Cause you can kind of make your own, um, scenarios in there.

994
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,780
Jamie's giving me the metal hand right there.

995
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,420
All right.

996
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,820
Um, w what?

997
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,140
The camera's too far over.

998
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,100
I was trying to insert my, oh no, it's way too far over.

999
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,660
You gotta be able to get to about different Rob.

1000
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,660
There you go.

1001
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,060
All right.

But first one more story for you guys.

1008
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,700
And, um, it's a little bit of a retro, uh, some retro goodness.

1009
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,260
Quick.

1010
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,780
How do you get 30 lives in Contra?

1011
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.

1012
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,700
Exactly.

1013
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,020
Everybody knows the famous Konami code, right?

1014
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,140
Well, how do you get all of the power-ups in, um, Gradius?

1015
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,340
Uh, you pause the game and then up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.

1016
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,220
How do you do it in Proteus?

1017
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,900
Uh, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.

1018
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,300
Backwards.

1019
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,340
Whatever.

1020
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,700
Here's the thing.

1021
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,780
So everybody knows that fricking Konami code.

1022
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,220
Well, what's funny is that, um, you can actually use this code in Google reader.

1023
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,500
Seriously, this code works in Google reader for presented from Google.

1024
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,340
If you put up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA on your keyboard,

1025
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,140
and you don't have to hit start because there is no start key on your keyboard.

1026
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,540
Um, all of your unread items will be reset to 30.

1027
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,860
And a little Ninja will come on the screen to watch you surf RSS feeds.

1028
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
And you might be asking why.

1029
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,980
And to that, I say, why the hell not?

1030
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,580
There you have it.

1031
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,420
Let's go to the phones and take some calls.

1032
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,580
If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1033
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,700
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1034
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,580
Who's this?

1035
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,860
Hi, this is Zorman calling in today.

1036
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,180
Hi.

1037
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,180
I'm just calling in today because I just know that never gets out before came out.

1038
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,180
And that's why you let everybody know that I'm

1039
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,540
basically not the type of person just bored into the hype.

1040
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,820
And I'm a kind of believer that I know that Loki has a little get solid and everything,

1041
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,780
but like, does anybody ever believe that there's going to be a good chance

1042
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,300
that the game's going to come out?

1043
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,780
Xbox 360.

1044
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,580
So you think this game is going to come out for Xbox 360.

1045
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,340
So somebody like me who's thinking of taking the plunge to get PlayStation 3

1046
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,660
soon to play a game like this ought to just wait.

1047
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,980
Exactly.

1048
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:35,780
OK, you know, I got to ask why, because this story comes up a lot where, you know,

1049
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,900
there's the OMG is going to come out on 360 and then Konami says, no, it's not.

1050
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,500
OMG is going to come out on 360.

1051
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,940
No, it's really not.

1052
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:47,060
So what do you think is now why it's going to come out now that it's been released?

1053
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:54,100
Well, one of the reasons why I think is because of the amount of if they don't pull the

1054
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,020
certain amount of system that they need, that they're going to have to come over and notice

1055
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:07,060
Bioshock and notice that was supposed to be originally for only exclusive Xbox 360.

1056
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,980
So I just think that maybe they just kept everybody quiet and hopefully it's going to

1057
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,540
come over to Xbox 360 to make money.

1058
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,500
Ah, so you're saying like very similar to the reasons why Bioshock and all those games

1059
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,460
were kept secret.

1060
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,140
And, you know, they swore that these that system, maybe Metal Gear Solid is going to

1061
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,020
go that same way.

1062
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,820
Did you see that little thing that was making the rounds around the Internet this week about

1063
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,580
kind of the joke that's inside Metal Gear about having to change discs?

1064
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,180
And then the guy the guy says, oh, wait, no, you don't have to change this because you're

1065
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,380
playing a Blu-ray game.

1066
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,260
You know, you see that?

1067
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,540
Oh, no, no, I haven't.

1068
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,060
But I haven't seen that.

1069
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,220
I tried my best to ignore all my friends that actually bought into the hype.

1070
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,340
I just I just really understand because you know how Microsoft is moving over the Blu-ray

1071
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,260
to understand that part.

1072
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,940
And it doesn't necessarily need to be on a Blu-ray disc for it to work as well.

1073
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,300
That's that's why I'm thinking that it's there's a good chance it could it can always

1074
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,180
revamp it and change it, you know, for it to work with 360.

1075
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,180
Yeah, but even if Microsoft came out with the Blu-ray player, which, you know, that

1076
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,420
rumor we brought that rumor up on last week's show and then Monday came no announcement.

1077
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,540
But let's say let's say Microsoft did come out with a Blu-ray player, although at this

1078
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,860
point, I don't think they will until their next system.

1079
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,980
But let's say let's say they did.

1080
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,340
Let's say they came out with a Blu-ray player.

1081
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,900
I don't think they're going to start putting out games on that player because they're

1082
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,660
going to want to tap into their existing user base.

1083
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,460
They don't want to suddenly say games can only be on this.

1084
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,860
You know, I just don't think there'd be enough market for that.

1085
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,560
Right.

1086
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:39,560
I think that the user base is bigger on Xbox 360.

1087
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,800
And I think they'd rather tap into that user base.

1088
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:48,840
And I think they could be more influenced from Konami because the game isn't necessarily

1089
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,520
it's not like they're not it's not like Sony owns Konami in any way.

1090
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:53,660
Right.

1091
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,840
Well, you know, I would love to see the Xbox 360 port happen as well, but I don't know

1092
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,480
sometimes for whatever reason, they like to keep these things system exclusive for whatever

1093
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,520
backdoor deals happen.

1094
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:05,960
So we'll see.

1095
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,440
Konami will keep tonight, but E3 would be a good time for them to announce it if they

1096
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:10,940
wanted to.

1097
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah, you're right.

1098
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,520
And that didn't come up yet as well.

1099
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,560
So we'll see.

1100
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,400
Let's just all keep our fingers together.

1101
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:17,900
Thanks a lot.

1102
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,760
All right.

1103
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,320
Take care, buddy.

1104
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,960
Thanks for calling.

1105
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,960
I'll be crossing my fingers for you on the Xbox 360 Metal Gear.

1106
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,680
I don't know.

1107
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,360
Part of me says not going to happen.

1108
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,600
I think they've denied it so many times.

1109
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,440
I think if they were to come out and release on 360 now, I don't know.

1110
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,240
They'd have to have a lot of extras or something to kind of justify it.

1111
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,040
But we'll see.

1112
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,360
We'll see.

1113
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:36,840
You never know.

1114
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1115
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,180
Who's this?

1116
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,320
This is Oscar.

1117
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,680
Hey, Oscar, what's on your mind, buddy?

1118
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,000
Not much.

1119
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,920
I'm just happy that I managed to get my hands on the Metal Gear Solid 4 limited edition

1120
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,480
this week.

1121
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,360
Ah, what'd you think?

1122
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,120
I didn't even reserve the game either.

1123
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,620
What's that?

1124
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,800
I didn't even reserve the game either, and I found it.

1125
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,960
I think they did a pretty good job.

1126
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,920
They knew the demand was going to be pretty high for this, so they made a lot of copies

1127
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,320
of it.

1128
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,040
Well, what'd you think?

1129
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,160
Surely you've opened it up by now.

1130
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,660
What do you think?

1131
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,040
Well, I've only had time to play about three hours of it so far, and it's pretty great.

1132
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,400
It's really epic.

1133
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,960
That's the only word you can describe it.

1134
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,680
I think that's kind of the consensus around here at OLR Studios this evening.

1135
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,480
The game is epic.

1136
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,080
What makes it so epic?

1137
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,520
Is it just the cutscenes epic?

1138
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,320
What is it that makes the game so epic?

1139
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,880
Well, I remember back when Hideo Kojima, he was all talking about how the

1140
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,400
PS3 was the only system he wanted to be in because he wanted to be like a movie, basically.

1141
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,120
And I don't know.

1142
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,400
It kind of plays like a movie to me.

1143
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,040
Here's my question, because you have the cutscenes, and we've heard a lot about the cutscenes,

1144
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,520
and how they're very long, and how they're very epic.

1145
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,000
How about the game itself, the actual game that you are playing?

1146
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,600
I mean, is the game cool?

1147
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,360
Well, what's it consider?

1148
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,000
Is it like a...

1149
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,560
What kind of game is it even consider?

1150
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,480
It's like a strategy shooter or something like that?

1151
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,840
A stealth action strategy game.

1152
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,240
I don't know.

1153
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,240
Okay.

1154
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,160
Well, I don't know.

1155
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,600
Usually the games are kind of like that.

1156
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,160
Like, I don't know.

1157
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,120
All I can think of is like Rainbow Six, maybe.

1158
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,520
But I got bored with Rainbow Six.

1159
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,400
This I didn't.

1160
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,160
I'm very into it.

1161
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:28,120
Is it because the story really draws you in in a way that maybe Rainbow Six doesn't really

1162
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,560
have quite the same epic cutscenes?

1163
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,320
That has to be it.

1164
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,560
Rainbow Six, the story was...

1165
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,880
I don't know, bored me.

1166
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,240
As I was saying earlier in the show, Kojima has always been a bit of a storyteller, even

1167
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,280
in the NES days.

1168
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,320
I mean, the very, very first Metal Gear game that was on the NES, or really, MSX, if you

1169
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:51,480
want to go that far back, kind of had depth and story that not a lot of games at that

1170
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:51,960
time had.

1171
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,600
Quelltippo in chat says it's tactical espionage action.

1172
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,560
I forgot that.

1173
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,840
It even says it right there on the box.

1174
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,520
That would be the genre the game fits into.

1175
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,000
Okay, that's what I thought it was.

1176
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,480
There you go.

1177
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:03,720
All right.

1178
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,160
All right.

1179
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,920
And there's no guard humping in this one.

1180
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,000
Well, Asif or anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1181
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,760
I got Mario Kart Wii, and I challenge you.

1182
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,680
All right, we'll make it happen.

1183
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,880
We'll have to set up a time.

1184
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,120
I'll try to set up something in the forums this week, like a time.

1185
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,520
Because Bobby Black Wolf wants to have a go at it, too.

1186
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,760
So I'll try to set something up when we're both available.

1187
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,360
All right.

1188
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,000
All right.

1189
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
We'll let you know.

1190
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,480
Okay.

1191
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:29,720
All right.

1192
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,200
Later, buddy.

1193
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,480
All right.

1194
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:31,880
See you.

1195
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,600
See you.

1196
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:32,920
All right.

1197
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,080
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1198
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,520
Our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

1199
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,480
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

1200
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:37,800
Who's this?

1201
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,000
This is Spazzinator.

1202
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,880
Hey, Spazzinator.

1203
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,600
What's on your mind, buddy?

1204
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,840
Well, I just want to kind of comment on two or three things, if I may.

1205
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,340
Sure.

1206
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,200
Yeah.

1207
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,400
It's for your little rant about Nintendo earlier in Parday.

1208
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,880
Uh-huh.

1209
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,840
The only thing I'm going to say is right on.

1210
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,280
In fact, I've been more or less boycotting up for the past 10 or 11 years.

1211
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,920
I can't speak for everyone out there.

1212
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:15,800
But personally, I feel that Nintendo really hasn't been pointing out anything for their

1213
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,360
systems.

1214
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,360
They've really been overly compelling, aside from maybe one or two titles for the past

1215
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,960
couple systems.

1216
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:32,600
And of course, Smash Brothers Brawl and whatnot notwithstanding.

1217
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,120
But the last really truly system they really had was the Super Nintendo.

1218
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:48,440
But granted, the N64 did have a few good games out there, like Goldeneye and whatnot.

1219
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,280
But aside from that, ever since then, they've been going downhill ever since then.

1220
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,120
You know, I've cooled off a little bit, since I got very hot-headed during Parday.

1221
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,360
And I'm a little regretful that the actions of this guy at Nintendo of Europe kind of

1222
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,840
hurts the company's image as a whole.

1223
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:15,160
Right on down from the president, from Reggie Visa May, all the way down to the little people

1224
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,800
that work at Nintendo that probably don't deserve a boycott or what have you.

1225
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,800
But damn it, something has got to give.

1226
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,400
And we have got to show that this guy is made of suck for making this statement.

1227
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,600
Something beyond just a little apology needs to happen.

1228
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,280
Because here's the thing.

1229
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,280
And the reason why I said as part of my boycott that if Nintendo addresses it, I would be

1230
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,320
OK with it.

1231
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,600
And I would end my boycott is because if Nintendo were to address it, it would invalidate

1232
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,400
everything this guy said about it being for geeks and otaku.

1233
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,680
And this guy would look like a moron.

1234
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,800
That's part of the reason why I said that I will forgive and forget if Nintendo will

1235
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,360
say, look, we are going to do something about it.

1236
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,200
And it's not just for geeks and otaku.

1237
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:13,080
Yeah, well, that guy's comments kind of factors into my opinion that over the past few years,

1238
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:19,480
you know, Nintendo has been getting like what I guess could be termed as like an overinflated

1239
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,040
ego.

1240
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:25,080
You know, they've been kind of like, I don't know if you want to call it ruffians or laurels

1241
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,000
or whatever or things then.

1242
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,720
But that's definitely prevalent on all sides of Nintendo.

1243
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,120
Hold up.

1244
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,360
Since Super Nintendo, you know, after Super Nintendo, Nintendo did not exactly enjoy world

1245
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,400
success with the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube.

1246
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,480
Granted, those systems weren't failure per se, but they weren't number one.

1247
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,120
It doesn't matter.

1248
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,960
They still think they're fucking cocky.

1249
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,520
And we see it on the retail side.

1250
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,720
We see it also on consumer side.

1251
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,720
Unfortunately, it's just, you know, I don't know their mentality.

1252
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:05,400
They have they control their market with the releasing of their systems and stuff like

1253
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,040
that.

1254
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,280
I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of shortage going around that's intentional.

1255
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,840
I mean, I don't know, but, you know, at the same time, they're doing this stuff, you know,

1256
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:22,760
with suing third party, you know, peripheral manufacturers and, you know, this stuff.

1257
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,440
They all they have a schedule of how they're going to release this stuff and they're going

1258
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,320
to slowly roll out stuff to keep people interested.

1259
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,840
It's just like, you know, Wii Fit and stuff.

1260
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:36,200
The Wii console people finally have it now and they're just like, hmm, how can we get

1261
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,760
people interested in this console again like they were at launch?

1262
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,240
Oh, I know.

1263
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,360
Let's release Wii Fit now and make that fucking hard to find.

1264
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,240
There you go.

1265
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,640
And now it's, you know, all coming around again.

1266
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,040
And watch when Wii Sports 2 comes out.

1267
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,160
Here we go again.

1268
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,640
It's just going to be, you know, a constant cycle.

1269
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,720
They're going to slowly roll out stuff that they should have rolled out at launch throughout

1270
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,560
the lifetime of this console.

1271
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:03,000
Somebody needs to tell Nintendo, I made you and I can break you just as easily.

1272
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,320
So much to tell Nintendo that people are going to stop waiting for stuff to happen and they're

1273
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:07,960
going to move on.

1274
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,760
Because they may buy your console, but they're not going to buy any of your games or buy

1275
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,440
your virtual console stuff.

1276
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,760
I mean, sure, they've made a little bit of money off of people from buying the console.

1277
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,280
I can't imagine that they're making a ton of money on each console sales.

1278
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,680
But, you know, if people are just staying there and playing Wii Sports and then say,

1279
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,120
ah, forget this online stuff, it's not happening and I can't, you know, find space to save

1280
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,280
my games and stuff and have to re-download them later.

1281
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,560
And people are just going to get confused and get overwhelmed by it and they're just

1282
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,280
going to say, forget it.

1283
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,040
I don't want to, I'm not going to do that.

1284
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,320
And it sucks because the people that are actually supporting them and utilizing this stuff,

1285
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,640
they're just saying, ah, you're not important.

1286
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,840
Don't get me wrong, you know, at least way back in the day, I used to be a really big

1288
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,360
Nintendo fanboy and whatnot.

1289
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:06,760
But, you know, once I started realizing that, you know, starting with N64, you know, relatively

1290
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,880
few games were coming out that I was particularly interested in, I kind of started, you know,

1291
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,080
fully, partially moving over to the Sony camp.

1292
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:21,880
And I've been with Sony now for, you know, ever since, like, roughly when Final Fantasy

1293
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,840
VII came out.

1294
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,920
Here's the thing, and, you know, in reference to kind of like what I said and stuff, is

1295
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,720
that, you know, I'm a Nintendo fanboy too, and this is what kind of stinks about the

1296
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,520
whole thing is that, you know, I've been so supportive of the Nintendo Wii and I've spent

1297
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:46,200
a lot, a lot of money on those virtual console downloads to kind of have this happen, sucks.

1298
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,120
So it's not about what, and if you're thinking I'm overreacting just because I was called

1299
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,840
the geek, you're not really hearing what I'm saying.

1300
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:59,160
I'm saying that why would Nintendo dismiss the people that have been supporting them

1301
00:59:59,160 --> 00:59:59,880
like this?

1302
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,800
That's what sucks about it.

1303
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:10,200
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I kind of, you know, you know, felt the same way, you know,

1304
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,200
when, you know, you know, going years back, not because, you know, they make comments,

1305
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,800
you know, you know, but because they weren't really keeping up with the times and they

1306
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,480
weren't, you know, their games weren't really going up with the people that have been supporting

1307
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,080
them since way back when, you know.

1308
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:38,200
Obviously, you know, the people that grew up with the original NES or SNES, eventually

1309
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,400
their, you know, taste and games were going to change and, you know, their selection of

1310
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,240
games, you know, didn't really change with the times, you know.

1311
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,480
All right, Spaznator, we've got to let you go so we can get to at least one more call,

1312
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,960
but thank you so much for your call and take care, okay?

1313
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,320
All right, you too.

1314
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:55,880
All right, bye-bye.

1315
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,640
All right, one more call.

1316
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,240
Boy, we didn't even have to wait.

1317
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,840
They're just calling in back to back tonight.

1318
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,640
I feel popular.

1319
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,760
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1320
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,080
Who's this?

1321
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,480
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

1322
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,680
Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?

1323
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,760
Oh, a lot of things.

1324
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,400
So what's this?

1325
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:11,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1326
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,440
First thing I want to ask, you're coming out here in like two weeks, right?

1327
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,480
Yes.

1328
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,840
Okay, and you said something about you're going to fix our Justin TV cam when you're

1329
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,340
here?

1330
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,080
I'm going to do my best.

1331
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,760
I am very technically inclined.

1332
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,440
All right, Loki thinks he can do it, too.

1333
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,480
So between the two of y'all, I think we're going to have a high-tech studio by the time

1334
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,160
the 4th of July rolls around.

1335
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,120
All right, you can talk about whatever you want to do now, sorry.

1336
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,960
Kill, kill.

1337
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,680
Couple of things.

1338
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,760
Ask for the guy from Nintendo of Europe by this comment, am I the only one that doesn't

1339
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,280
give two shits about what the hell he said?

1340
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,880
Well, here's the thing.

1341
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,080
I don't care.

1342
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,760
Look, I get called a geek.

1343
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,840
I say thanks, you know?

1344
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,000
I don't, being a geek is not a bad thing, but it's the fact that he was, and I think

1345
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Jamie kind of referenced this, he was using these things as a derogatory thing.

1346
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,760
So he's basically saying, well, we're not going to put something out because we don't

1347
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,600
really care about the people who want this.

1348
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,400
And it's kind of like, well, F you, because if I've spent $100 on all these different

1349
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,760
virtual console games I filled up and I was planning on spending even more, then if I'm

1350
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,720
just boo-boo to you, then forget it.

1351
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,920
I'm not going to spend any more money.

1352
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:25,960
Well, the proper thing to say would have been, Nintendo understands that this is definitely

1353
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,840
a problem and we are addressing it and we are working towards fixing said problem.

1354
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,520
Or just say, he could have just said, unfortunately, at this time, Nintendo has no fix for this.

1355
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,040
He could have given the same BS, the same line we've heard from Nintendo time and time

1356
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,440
again.

1357
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,080
Unfortunately, at this time, folks will have to delete the game and they can always re-download

1358
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,880
it for free.

1359
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,120
He could have given that same line and I wouldn't have cared.

1360
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,480
I would have still thought Nintendo probably needs to address their storage issue at some

1361
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,880
point, but I wouldn't have cared.

1362
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,760
But the fact that he had to be so standoffish about it just sucks.

1363
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,400
And why would you put someone like that in as your freaking VP of marketing?

1364
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,160
I mean, that's the part that appalls me.

1365
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,200
So they promote with him.

1366
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,360
Well, that's what it sounds like.

1367
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,480
Right.

1368
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,080
And Game Guru says, and Awada actually did say that, Rob, and I have nothing but nice

1369
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,840
things to say about Awada.

1370
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,000
I have nothing but I am a Nintendo fan boy.

1371
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,480
The man's done a lot and I'm fine with that line because I understand they're dancing

1372
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,080
around the fact that their system has limitations and that's the PC thing to say.

1373
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,640
But for this guy to come out with guns ablaze and is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, you

1374
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,600
want to pick a fight?

1375
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,480
You want to pick a fight?

1376
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,960
Sounds like the guy was PMSing.

1377
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,320
Seriously.

1378
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,520
Yes.

1379
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,280
I've had no more Nintendo talk.

1380
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,960
Seriously, I'm done with it.

1381
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,160
So what else is on your mind?

1382
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:47,400
I remember growing up that arcades were the shit.

1383
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,600
I remember growing up, my aunt would take me to this space called Nathan's.

1384
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,640
You go inside.

1385
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,320
It was like heaven.

1386
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,160
Hunt is like 50, 60 different kinds of arcades you can play.

1387
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,080
And that's why I first got my hands on Final Fight and fell in love with Capcom right there.

1388
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,800
And nowadays it's like you go into like a little rinky dink sports center where they

1389
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:16,040
have hockey, ice skating, you go upstairs as a concession stand, you go around the corner,

1390
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,920
there's three arcade machines and a bootleg Cuzar.

1391
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:25,080
The place I remember was a little place called Nickel Mania where you would pay $2.50 to

1392
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,000
get in and then all the games ran on nickels.

1393
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,280
It was awesome.

1394
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,360
That's like the first place I ever played Mortal Combat.

1395
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,040
That's cool.

1396
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,960
Sadly, it's no more.

1397
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:35,880
You know what?

1398
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,520
When you make your visit out here.

1399
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,480
Yeah, we're going to have to.

1400
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,440
We're going to have to take you to Roseville Golf Land because that's really one of the

1401
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,880
last actual arcades that I'm glad you didn't throwing good in there.

1402
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,600
It's it's what we got.

1403
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,040
I think that's I think that's a good way to pray.

1404
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,600
It's what we got.

1405
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,080
I went to Scandi and he said that it's just completely.

1406
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,880
Yes, yeah.

1407
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,440
Well, Scandi and Scandi is just confused on what it's trying to be anyways.

1408
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,080
But, you know, we might have to we have to actually might have to take a trip to Milpitas

1409
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,840
Golf Land because that one's still fairly decent.

1410
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,800
Yeah, Milpitas and Sunnyvale are still OK, even.

1411
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,320
But you notice it's Sunnyvale also has the test machines, though.

1412
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,600
But slowly that stuff's been going out and Flaming Fingers been coming in.

1413
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,320
Not that Flaming Fingers a bad thing, but too much of it is.

1414
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,760
What about the jump rope game again?

1415
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,120
Something we're going to have to go also go to John's incredibly mediocre pizza.

1416
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,680
Oh, we do need to go to John's incredibly shitty pizza.

1417
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,000
You haven't still haven't sent me a certain email, sir.

1418
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:38,940
I did.

1419
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,080
You did it just now.

1420
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:41,580
OK.

1421
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,280
No, like earlier last week.

1422
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,480
But God damn it.

1423
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,800
Y'all make me want to hop on a plane to come tonight.

1424
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,080
The problem is that your airline is trying to make me sign up for some mailing list so

1425
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,920
that I can actually see the email.

1426
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,520
So I just need a copy paste.

1427
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,120
No problem.

1428
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,320
I'll resend it out.

1429
01:05:59,320 --> 01:05:59,960
Thank you.

1430
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,120
All right, Rama, quickly, anything else before we end the show?

1431
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,440
No, that's it.

1432
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:05,800
All right.

1433
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,440
Take care, buddy.

1434
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,560
You too.

1435
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,520
Bye bye.

1436
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,020
Bye.

1437
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,840
Rob D says too much of the Flaming Finger is a bad thing.

1438
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,160
Let me clarify my statement.

1439
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,440
Too much of the Flaming Finger requires soothing action.

1440
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,640
There's nothing wrong with a little Flaming Finger here and there.

1441
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,280
But you don't want to OD on Flaming Finger.

1442
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,760
You need to mix it up a little bit.

1443
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,680
All right, forget it.

1444
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,760
That's going to do it for phone calls tonight.

1445
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,800
Thank you guys for calling in.

1446
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,920
If you didn't get through, so sorry.

1447
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,600
But send us an email or try again next week.

1448
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,840
Or you can always leave a voicemail.

1449
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,320
We'll catch up.

1450
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,840
I've got voicemails we got to play.

1451
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,600
We'll try to catch up on those in a future week.

1452
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,280
For now, we got to wrap it up.

1453
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,360
But not until we do some last minute stories of which I'm sure Loki has some.

1454
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:48,860
Loki?

1455
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,080
Yeah, I've just been going over the stuff that we didn't talk about.

1456
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,840
Part of the big leak list that we talked about in part A.

1457
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,640
Here's another game.

1458
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,680
I don't know what it's called.

1459
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:04,040
But it's basically Dr. Octopus and Magneto have joined forces to create the most dangerous

1460
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,560
alliance in the world ever known.

1461
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,920
And Spider-Man must team up with the X-Men to stop them.

1462
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:18,040
Choose two heroes to fight side by side across multiple levels spanning the globe from Manhattan

1463
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,400
to the Savage Lands.

1464
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:25,720
Pick Spidey or one of the dozen X-Men such as Wolverine, Cyclops, or Storm where it pays

1465
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,440
off to select different characters depending on the enemies you face or unique game environments

1466
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,240
you are in.

1467
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,800
Earn upgrades for each character you use.

1468
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,600
Experience unique combos specific to tube.

1469
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:41,000
Are they just reusing the Marvel Ultimate Alliance engine like over and over and over

1470
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,320
again?

1471
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,200
I mean seriously.

1472
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,120
Or I should say X-Men Legends engine.

1473
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,120
All right.

1474
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,720
Anyways, let's see what else here.

1475
01:07:52,120 --> 01:08:00,840
We've got some more stuff coming from this big leak list here including...

1476
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,480
Oh, we talked about all this stuff.

1477
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,240
They have the Mensa workout.

1478
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,480
I guess it's gonna be another brain training game for the Wii.

1479
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:15,320
And I don't know how Extreme Makeover Home Edition is gonna be any fun.

1480
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:15,720
We'll see.

1481
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,480
There was a game I had on the Commodore 64 called like Dream House or something like

1482
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:25,320
that and pretty much all you did is you went through the house and you could paint all

1483
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,840
the like you could paint the ceiling and the walls a different color one of 16 colors because

1484
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:32,680
you know Commodore 64 was cutting edge and then you could put furniture in the house

1485
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,320
too.

1486
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,760
And but you were only limited to like eight pieces of furniture in a room because you

1487
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,760
know there's all those limitations on the 64.

1488
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,240
I hope that God was like half these games are fake or not really fake but just like

1489
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,240
concepts that are never gonna come to you know in the past because if that's the case

1490
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,520
there's gonna be like 20 Spider-Man games coming out between now and like probably a

1491
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,800
couple years from now.

1492
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:56,920
Including Spider-Man Agile Warrior where it lets players control Spider or Spider-Man

1493
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,760
with the Wii balance board.

1494
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,000
There's Spider-Man Hero Evolved for the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.

1495
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,440
Replay as the son of Spider-Man in 2064 using spider powers and future check to battle

1496
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,920
villains.

1497
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,920
There's Spider-Man New Heights for the 360, PS3, and the Wii.

1498
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,000
Upgrade Spidey's abilities as he moves from battling low-level gangs to famous foes in

1499
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,200
the New York skyline.

1500
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,240
Spider-Man Gangs of New York.

1501
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:29,720
Okay seriously uh gangs take over the whole city and Spider-Man must pit them against

1502
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,200
each other.

1503
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,760
Spider-Man Adaption.

1504
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,720
Spidey travels all over the globe from Tokyo to Paris to Moscow to take out foes.

1505
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,440
Marvel Team-Up.

1506
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,640
Spider-Man meets X-Men.

1507
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,720
I think that was the one that I was talking about earlier.

1508
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,160
Spider-Man Contest of Champions 360, PS3, and Wii.

1509
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:53,000
Destructible fighter for two to four players with Spider-Man, Venom, Wolverine, Electro,

1510
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,120
Doc Oc, Carnage, and the Green Goblin.

1511
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,080
Spider-Man Mass Evolution for all three systems.

1512
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:05,800
Spidey skills from strength to speed to Spidey sense are upgradable as you play.

1513
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,160
Spider-Man Chaos for all three systems.

1514
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:15,000
Spidey has eight hours of frenetic action to save the safe from certain doom.

1515
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,720
Spider-Man Tactics, a stealthy and strategic Spidey game.

1516
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,760
Spider-Man Vision, first and third person gameplay Spidey style.

1517
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,760
Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies.

1518
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:34,680
Spider-Man Webmaster for the Wii, a web shooting game for a third person action.

1519
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:41,960
Spider-Man Web Slinger, use precision web aiming to target enemies building or build

1520
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,040
web slingshots and snipe enemies.

1521
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,840
I think some of those are all like ideas but aren't going to come out because that'd be

1522
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,040
way too much.

1523
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:58,040
The avatars, one of the things that people noticed, there were some licensed things with

1524
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,320
them as well so maybe some licensed clothing stuff you'll be able to get it because they

1525
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,800
had one of them with an Incredibles t-shirt.

1526
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,560
Sounds kind of neat.

1527
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,840
Let's see here.

1528
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,720
Oh, Ultimate Band.

1529
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:19,240
They're going to be doing an Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 version apparently of the game

1530
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:25,080
and it will be to, I'm sure, Rob's enjoyment, compatible with Rock Band instruments.

1531
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,800
Thank God.

1532
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,800
And the Wii U version, of course, does not have instruments at all.

1533
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,240
And it's actually got a video out there for it too on how you play.

1534
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,200
It's kind of interesting.

1535
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,560
Let's see here.

1536
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:45,080
Then there was also one of the things was the SBGs, which is server-based gaming, and

1537
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:50,600
apparently it's going to be like a social networking blade or something like that that

1538
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:56,680
allow you to play games from game shows like Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and

1539
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,560
other things like that.

1540
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,720
So that's kind of interesting.

1541
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:08,280
And finally, Powers and Titans, which is a multiplayer superhero game that's apparently

1542
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:13,160
going to be something that Joss Whedon is going to be a part of.

1543
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:13,800
Woohoo!

1544
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,240
So I don't know what exactly that is, but probably some sort of superhero game.

1545
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,280
Actually, I'm mad at him.

1546
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,320
Why?

1547
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:21,720
Why?

1548
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,240
For the end of Astonishing X-Men.

1549
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,960
Okay.

1550
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,920
I think you'll get over it.

1551
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:28,600
Oh, no.

1552
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,080
You don't.

1553
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,400
That.

1554
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:29,900
No.

1555
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:40,920
And finally, in unrelated news, you may remember the Wii Fit girl who's been kind of floating

1556
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,680
around, she had the YouTube video where she shook her ass while playing Wii Fit.

1557
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,000
Yes.

1558
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,120
Well, Playboy's Joe Garcia has put out her own videos that are a little bit more seductive,

1559
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,200
also her playing Wii Fit as well.

1560
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,240
Trying to cash in on that.

1561
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:55,560
Nice.

1562
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:00,760
Well, you know we've moved into a new generation where people are trying to cash in on other

1563
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,120
people's YouTube videos.

1564
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,760
It's amazing.

1565
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,080
Absolutely amazing.

1566
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:11,400
Yeah, so all right, awesome, and it'll be interesting.

1567
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,400
Logie will review those videos next week on the show.

1568
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,880
I don't know if there's...

1569
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,480
Well, it didn't look that interesting.

1570
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,400
I mean, she didn't look that interesting.

1571
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,080
She doesn't get naked, okay?

1572
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:25,240
I mean, this is a Playboy little pictorial thing that she does not get naked.

1573
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,680
I do not approve of that.

1574
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,180
Fine.

1575
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,960
But I do approve of people, you know, taking it to the next step.

1576
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:32,460
All right.

1577
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:37,340
To which I say, Wii Fit girl, you're a rebuttal.

1578
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:42,940
If that's going to do it for our last minute stories tonight, I guess we're going to go

1579
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:46,700
ahead and wrap up the show and bring another week of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.

1580
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,740
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, our sixth anniversary show, if you can believe it.

1581
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,740
But nothing too special going on.

1582
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,780
Same old shit we always do.

1583
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:55,980
Hopefully some guests.

1584
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,540
I know...

1585
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,220
No one's made any suggestions.

1586
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,900
Mieglatov will be here next week.

1587
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,100
I should get my husband here.

1588
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,380
So we'll at least have him.

1589
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,820
I was trying, by the way, I was trying to get one story we didn't get to tonight.

1590
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:06,700
I don't know if you read this.

1591
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,900
Did you read on the gaming blogs this week about that lady who's running for state senate

1592
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:16,940
in Connecticut and how it's like this big deal, like, oh, politicians getting into games

1593
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:19,180
because she has a level 70 in World of Warcraft.

1594
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:20,780
Did you see that story?

1595
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,300
Yeah, I think it was last week.

1596
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,100
Wasn't it fun?

1597
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,620
I don't know if you thought of this, but didn't like the minute I read that, I'm like, what's

1598
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,740
the big freaking deal?

1599
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:33,340
Like my boyfriend ran for state senate in 2006 and he has two level 70s in Warcraft.

1600
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,100
I was actually trying to get him to come to the show tonight, but he didn't want to.

1601
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:38,140
He didn't.

1602
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,340
I don't know what he'd say.

1603
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,580
He was like, I don't know if I come up.

1604
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,340
He's like, what would I talk about if I went on your show?

1605
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,820
I'm like, you play more World of Warcraft than I do.

1606
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,380
You'd fit in.

1607
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:51,420
Whenever you see a story like that, you just have to think of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.

1608
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:51,980
I'm hip.

1609
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:52,460
I'm cool.

1610
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:59,260
Yeah, but I'm just saying, you know what?

1611
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:02,620
Politicians come in all different flavors, just like regular.

1612
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:06,460
Why does it matter what your job is and what you like to do in your spare time?

1613
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:12,060
For who the hell cares and what relevance does your gaming life have on your political

1614
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:12,540
views?

1615
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,460
Well, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

1616
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,020
To be fair.

1617
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:19,660
The reason why I think it was going around is because, you know, there's been a lot of

1618
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,340
negative political, like, you know, all these politicians are trying to ban games.

1619
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:27,900
All these politicians are, you know, putting into place these, you know, that, you know,

1620
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,420
all these violent video games are going to be banned or games are like porn and all this

1621
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,660
stuff.

1622
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,100
So it was a little refreshing to hear of a politician who's like, yeah, I play World

1623
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:35,740
of Warcraft.

1624
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,340
So well, I was just thinking she's not the first.

1625
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:45,740
But I just don't see what, you know, what you like to do as a hobby unless, you know,

1626
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:51,100
you like to, you know, skin kittens in your backyard or something as a hobby.

1627
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,500
No, you know, but you play, you play video game.

1628
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,100
What's the problem?

1629
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:55,980
Who cares?

1630
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,380
I don't know.

1631
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:01,420
You know why it's like, you know, I don't care what people's bedroom habits are.

1632
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,940
I don't care what their gaming habits are.

1633
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:08,300
You know, as long as they're not hurting anybody, what does it matter?

1634
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,500
Right, right.

1635
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,500
And people piss me off.

1636
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,140
By the way, speaking of not caring about what goes on behind closed doors, I do want

1637
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:24,780
to say, though, a very happy day tomorrow, Monday, June 15th and going on into June 16th

1638
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:30,700
to all the new couples who will be getting married in California who finally, finally

1639
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,140
have a quality.

1640
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,020
It's it's it's so amazing.

1641
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,420
I'm so happy to live in a state where that's going to only overrule it again.

1642
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:38,620
You know what?

1643
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,940
Not if I have anything to say about it.

1644
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:49,180
Well, did you did you hear from Amanda about no capital open up now?

1645
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,420
Did that actually happen?

1646
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,380
I saw the website.

1647
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,700
I know the friend was talking about opening one in the Castro.

1648
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,580
Did that actually happen?

1649
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,380
I think so.

1650
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,260
Oh, my God.

1651
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:58,860
We'll have to get a link from her.

1652
01:16:59,500 --> 01:16:59,900
Wow.

1653
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,660
That's great if that actually happened, huh?

1654
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,380
But you know what?

1655
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:07,100
I honestly think that, you know, eventually and I think that more and more people are

1656
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,820
realizing this, that what does it matter?

1657
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:13,580
I mean, and personally, and I've had this discussion with other people before, I actually

1658
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:18,620
think that marriage should not be a government institution.

1659
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,180
You know what I mean?

1660
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,820
Well, thankfully, and boy, we got off topic of video games.

1661
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:22,460
That's all right.

1662
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:22,780
They know.

1663
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,500
That's all right.

1664
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,260
Thankfully, it's a topic that's important to me.

1665
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:25,740
So you know what?

1666
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:26,240
Deal.

1667
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:33,180
Thankfully, the youth of America does not have their head up their ass in this regard.

1668
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,780
The majority in this regard.

1669
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,500
Yeah, the majority.

1670
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,980
And I still know it makes me very.

1671
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,940
Yeah, there's always going to be somebody with their head up their ass, but it makes

1672
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,380
me very hopeful for the future.

1673
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,140
Yeah, very hopeful for the future.

1674
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:44,940
All right.

1675
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,140
I was going to say one thing.

1676
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:46,540
I'm sorry.

1677
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,660
I missed one last thing.

1678
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:48,800
Yeah.

1679
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,220
Confident.

1680
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:53,020
This is actually coming from our friends over at Bawani Style.

1681
01:17:53,660 --> 01:18:01,180
Apparently, there was an MTV pack or an advertisement for rock band that they were showing a bunch

1682
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,820
of songs kind of scrolling through the song list.

1683
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,100
And lo and behold, there's a bunch of songs that haven't come out yet in there.

1684
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,260
So four songs that they spotted on there.

1685
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:16,860
The Aesthetics of Hate by Machine Head, Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, which I believe is coming

1686
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:23,020
out this next week, Breed by Nirvana, and Burn by Nine Inch Nails.

1687
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:24,320
Sweet.

1688
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:25,580
Sounds like fun.

1689
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:31,260
And I was going to say, I think there's a couple other stories that they had, too.

1690
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,260
There was something about like new DDR or something like that.

1691
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:40,620
It was a DDR fitness thing.

1692
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:45,100
They had some details on Konami's website and stuff.

1693
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:53,260
And then there's also some new rhythm game that's coming to the Xbox 360 that I don't

1694
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:55,580
know what it really is yet.

1695
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:00,220
Probably something that they're going to be announcing maybe at E3 or something like that.

1696
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,180
Beat and Groovy, as it was called.

1697
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:07,180
It's an E-rated Konami published title.

1698
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:11,900
It says, from the sound of it, sounds like Konami's rhythm game, of course.

1699
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:18,220
And it was found on the Australia's ratings board webpage.

1700
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:26,300
And there is also another Xbox 360 titled Domino Master, which is supposed to be coming

1701
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,380
to Xbox Live Arcade.

1702
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:33,660
Wonder if that's Mr. Domino, because that'd be funny.

1703
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,220
All right.

1704
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:42,060
Now that we've had the last, last, last minute stories, let's go ahead and wrap up the show.

1705
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,700
We got all the final thoughts.

1706
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,380
We got the last, last minute story.

1707
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:50,060
And you know Ultimate Band has Miley Cyrus in it, because it's a Disney title.

1708
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,340
Oh my God.

1709
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:51,980
So I was right.

1710
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,020
It has Hannah Montana in it.

1711
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,580
I have ESPN.

1712
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:59,420
Isn't Dolly Parton our godmother?

1713
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,100
I think so.

1714
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:01,900
That's cool.

1715
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,140
Yeah.

1716
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,420
I like Dolly Parton.

1717
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,500
I don't like Hannah Montana, but I like Dolly Parton.

1718
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:05,740
All right.

1719
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:05,980
All right.

1720
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:09,900
Before we get out of here tonight, we have one more thing we wanted to play for you guys.

1721
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,660
It came up in the email earlier.

1722
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:14,940
It was what Katamari's Forever emailed us, right?

1723
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:22,540
And sent us the parody of Still Alive, but it's featuring the OLR themed lyrics.

1724
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,020
Yes.

1725
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:25,900
So we're actually going to play that for the listeners before we sign off tonight.

1726
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:26,860
So here it is.

1727
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,700
And then we're going to be out of here.

1728
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:33,100
So big thanks to Katamari's Forever and all the fans who got together to make the lyrics.

1729
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:33,820
I can't wait to hear this.

1730
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:56,540
Here you go.

1731
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:24,540
Yes.

1732
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,540
But is it a stereo?

1733
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,820
That was a joke.

1734
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:40,780
Haha.

1735
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,340
No, no.

1736
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:48,780
Jamie's eating a scummy, but then again it's lucky.

1737
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,300
Look at us still singing with this used to be.

1738
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,860
Told me I tore the heart, but inside here it's so clear.

1739
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,780
Let this keep on the light.

1740
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:04,700
Oh, OLR Sunday nights, it's Pacific night and we still have time.

1741
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:08,460
And believe me, no 365.

1742
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:12,460
I'm doing podcasts without 365.

1743
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:16,460
We're here on August, not 365.

1744
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:20,460
And while you're dying, we'll know it's 365.

1745
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,460
Podcasts of the year we all gonna strive.

1746
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,460
Gonna strive.

1747
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,700
Gonna strive.

1748
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,660
Yay, nice job Katamari's Forever.

1749
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,300
That was very cool.

1750
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,420
It was a little hard to hear the voice, but that's okay.

1751
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:38,140
I think on headphones, it'll come out a lot better.

1752
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:44,060
I think it'll be easier to hear on headphones, but nice job and very, very flattering, nevertheless.

1753
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,380
So thank you very much for that.

1754
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,460
And thank you to everybody who is involved with that.

1755
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:51,340
Okay, now I think we can end the show.

1756
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:55,020
So thank you very much for supporting independent podcasting as you always do.

1757
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:59,740
Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program and help

1758
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,660
spread the word because that's, you know, we don't have any big magazine or website backing

1759
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:03,820
us.

1760
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,300
So we rely on word of mouth to get the word out.

1761
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,300
We do this for free because we heart you.

1762
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,940
So we'll see you next week for our sixth anniversary show.

1763
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:12,140
That's going to do it for another OLR.

1764
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,020
Good night.

1765
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:16,220
