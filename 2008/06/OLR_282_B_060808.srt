4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,460
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,180
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,780
It is Sunday, June 8th, 2008, and if you're thinking to yourself,

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,780
that's not what day I'm listening to this on my iPod or my Zune or whatever device you use to listen to the podcast, PSP, whatever.

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,500
It's because you're not tuning in live. We tape live on Sunday nights, thanks to our friends at allgames.com.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,720
We tape at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,260
So sometimes he runs long, sometimes he runs short, just depends.

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,760
But usually he catches around 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,560
Honestly, if you get here at like 4.45, there's a great block of programming on allgames.com.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,200
It starts off with Kopackins UK Gaming News, moves on into the Bobby Black Wolf show,

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,060
and ends with us, your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,360
We're about to get into the gaming news here for part B.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,620
I just wanted to say real quick though, we got some guests coming up later this month.

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,940
I'm trying to arrange some interviews. I don't have anything sealed yet, so I'll get back to you guys on that.

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,820
But in studio, one of our long-time OLR friends who hasn't been here in a long time is going to be back in two weeks.

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,300
Mikolatov will be here visiting in two weeks, so he'll be back on the program.

20
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,300
So we'll have to play High School Musical stuff for him and get him the game.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,340
Maybe he can tell us what happened to Silent Hill Arcade.

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,860
He wanted to go to the whole Happening thing that we were going to do.

23
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,780
I think I may postpone it a week so we can include him as well.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,460
As well.

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,340
So, you know.

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,300
Because the Happening, I think it's going to suck, but it'll be like a lady in the water.

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,740
We can either go all enjoy it or all make fun of it.

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,060
Well, since the chatters have no idea what you're talking about,

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,940
you're trying to organize people to go see M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, right?

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,440
Yes.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,940
I want to see it.

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,440
This is the Happening.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,940
Yeah.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,940
I haven't seen Lady in the Water.

35
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,940
Well, consider yourself lucky then.

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,820
But I liked, I liked The Village a lot.

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,940
I liked The Village too and I thought people were really hard on that movie, but honestly.

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,220
And I really liked The Sixth Sense.

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,780
I loved The Sixth Sense. I even liked Unbreakable, but seriously, Lady in the Water was shit.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,140
My problem with The Village, my problem with The Village though is they show you what the twist is,

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,620
and then they're like, oh, pretend you didn't see that.

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,620
You know, we're going to do the twist again.

43
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
Oh, just kidding.

44
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
It's actually what it was before.

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
Yeah, that's, that's my problem with it.

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
All right.

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
So he'll be back.

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,620
I don't know if he can tell us anything about the latest and greatest.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,620
It is a video game employer he was working for for a while, but we'll see if we can prod anything out of him.

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,620
And also later this month, June 22nd is the, and I guess he'll be here for it.

51
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,620
The Orange Lounge Radio sixth anniversary show will be on June 22nd, which also happens to be around the time of my birthday.

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
I'm going to a theme park on my birthday.

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,620
Myself and the other half are going to Great America.

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:01,620
That'll be fun because he doesn't really go ride roller coasters, but I told him he has to ride everything I want him to, and he'll scream like a girl.

55
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,620
And we'll get you two.

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,620
Roller coasters are, I won't say great because I've only ever really been on one.

57
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,620
But the one I've been on is great.

58
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,620
Which one have you been on?

59
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
California Screamin'.

60
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Nice.

61
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
You were there.

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,620
Oh, I forgot that was like the only one.

63
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,620
Some of the ones they have at like Great America are awesome, like Flight Deck, which used to be top gun.

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,620
It's still, it'll always be top gun to me.

65
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
Awesomesauce.

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
But keep in mind, the only ones I will go on has me sitting over the rails, are made of metal.

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
I will not go on a wood roller coaster.

68
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,620
And have no twisties.

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,620
Well, I think Flight Deck has twisties.

70
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,620
What's that one huge arcade game that they have there also at Great America?

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,620
The one that you actually go into a separate room to play?

72
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Oh.

73
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,620
I don't remember.

74
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,620
That's when those 3D, no that was a 3D ride.

75
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
No, it's not a 3D ride.

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,620
It's a video game.

77
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,620
Yeah, it like, it would cost you like 3 bucks to play.

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,620
I forget what it's called.

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,620
It's on Wikipedia.

80
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
It might have been since the last time I've been.

81
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
I haven't been.

82
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
Kadosho says Goose and Maverick?

83
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,620
Oh, no, no.

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Sorry, that's a reference to Top Gun.

85
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
What the hell am I thinking?

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Nice one.

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
It's something 3.

88
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
I don't remember what it's called.

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
But anyways.

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

91
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,620
Enough about our personal lives.

92
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Let's talk gaming.

93
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Yes.

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:20,620
So the sci-fi channel, curator of really crappy sci-fi movies and also a variety of TV shows

95
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
and reality shows and whatnot.

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,620
They are creating a brand new, kind of a hybrid show.

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,620
It's gonna be both a TV show and it's also gonna be an MMO.

98
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,620
And it says apparently the integration with the MMO is gonna affect the stuff that happens

99
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
on air.

100
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,620
So, for example, they gave, we can tell players that there'll be an alien invasion at a certain

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,620
place in the game at a certain time.

102
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,620
And to be there, all their friends and stuff will be ready at that time.

103
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,620
And it says the outcome depends on them and then the battle will be part of the universe

104
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
in the show.

105
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,620
So if they fail and they all die, then that will be reflected on the TV show.

106
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Which I think is pretty cool.

107
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:14,620
And it says both the show and the series will be set 80 to 100 years in the future and launched

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,620
sometime sooner than summer of 2010.

109
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,620
When I read this or hear about it, I can't help but think, how awesome would the Battlestar

110
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
Galactica game have been if it was this?

111
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
You know what I mean?

112
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Like that Battlestar Galactica thing they put on Xbox was like junk.

113
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,620
But there's a great game somewhere in the Battlestar Galactica universe.

114
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,620
And something like this is like an MMO where what happens in the show happens.

115
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
That would be awesome!

116
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,620
I don't want to feel the fanboy flames or anything, but wouldn't this be funny?

117
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,620
Just throwing it out there.

118
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,620
If it was like, say, a relaunch of Firefly or something like that.

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,620
You know, and they have this whole universe that takes place at the same time and that

120
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,620
kind of thing.

121
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,620
That would be funny.

122
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,620
That would be kind of cool, but sadly I think the cast is all doing other stuff now.

123
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,620
So I guess it could be like a new generation, but I don't know.

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,620
This doesn't seem like something that Josh Whedon would be all over.

125
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
But you never know, I guess.

126
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,620
I doubt it.

127
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
It'd be probably something original.

128
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,620
Most likely.

129
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,620
Most likely.

130
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,620
Well, something else original and actually spotted in the wild this week.

131
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Duke Nukem Forever.

132
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
Yes, it exists.

133
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,620
It's out there, and you can actually see a little peek of it in this very strange place.

134
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,620
You would think if Duke Nukem Forever is going to launch its first footage ever, it's going

135
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,620
to be like a one-up exclusive or a game trailer's hot land or whatever they call it.

136
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,620
But it shows up on the Jace Hall show, which now he used to be the monolith boss, and I

137
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,620
guess he has his own little web show now.

138
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
And I guess it's kind of like parody.

139
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,620
It's like video game sitcom.

140
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
Like the offices.

141
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
It's interesting.

142
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,620
But they kind of joke about Duke Nukem Forever, and it actually is Duke Nukem Forever that

143
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
you see in the little show.

144
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,620
It's around like the 4 minute and 15 second mark.

145
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,620
And the most surprising thing about it, it actually looks kind of cool for that 30 seconds.

146
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
I don't know if it only gets worse.

147
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,620
Hell of a way to hype something up, you know?

148
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:29,620
This guy just landed a really great exclusive and a hell of a way to kick off his new show.

149
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,620
I mean, he should be...

150
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,620
I don't know what kind of ties he has to the Duke Nukem folks.

151
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
I don't know the relationships all these companies had.

152
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Well, I actually watched the show, and it was pretty funny other than that stuff.

153
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,620
They did some interviews with a guy from Heroes.

154
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
He's doing his own movie and stuff.

155
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,620
But what the focus of the show is supposed to be is on the people developing the games

156
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
and not necessarily the games themselves.

157
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,620
And celebrities who play games and stuff like that.

158
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,620
So that's their kind of spin on things.

159
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Less about the games, but more about the developers and people behind the stuff.

160
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Is it one of those things...

161
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,620
I didn't watch it, I'll be honest, because I didn't care about Duke Nukem Forever footage

162
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
because nothing will match the original to me.

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:16,620
But was it one of those things where it's kind of like self-parody

164
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,620
where you really kind of have to be in the know to understand the jokes?

165
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
Or was it really accessible?

166
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
I don't think so. It wasn't even really parody.

167
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,620
It was just an interview show.

168
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,620
They just shot it in the same way as you would shoot The Office or something like that.

169
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Lots of cuts, lots of just cutting between perspectives and stuff like that

170
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
and just talking to people.

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,620
And there was some goofy moments, but it was no different than, say, Air...

172
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Okay, I don't want to compare it to AirTainment Tonight or something like that.

173
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,620
But no different than a news show that you would see on TV when they do their news pieces.

174
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Except a little bit more knowledgeable and less cheesy.

175
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,620
But they still were playing around and stuff.

176
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,620
All right.

177
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Well, you can check that out if you're really eager to see some Duke Nukem Forever footage.

178
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,620
We're going to go over to DarkSakura next for her story.

179
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
But first, a follow-up to Part A.

180
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Hippolytus in chat has done some math regarding the Classic Games of the Week and says,

181
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,620
although only 8 of the 31 games are made by Sega, 13 are made for Sega Systems.

182
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Which actually, all things, I would have guessed it was much more.

183
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,620
That's not quite half.

184
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,620
I would have guessed it was half.

185
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,620
You know what? Here's the thing.

186
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Sega was grossly overlooked by a lot of people at the time it came out.

187
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
I think a lot of people, if they realized...

188
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,620
If you knew then what you know now about the Dreamcast, I bet you it would have done a lot better.

189
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,620
So it's okay that we highlight a lot of those games.

190
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Because a lot of people didn't give them a first look the first time around.

191
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
So, whatever.

192
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,620
That's it. Next week is another Dreamcast game.

193
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Fine.

194
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
It's going to be like Power Stone or something.

195
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
Dreamcast games until we get to half.

196
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Power Stone was awesome, wasn't it?

197
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,620
Power Stone was kind of awesome. I would approve of that, actually.

198
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,620
And you can use your save files from the Japanese version on the US version.

199
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
Alright, well keep it a surprise until next week.

200
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I might do that. I don't know.

201
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Meanwhile, more gaming news, yes?

202
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
Call of Duty 4!

203
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,620
Didn't that sound awesome? Anyway...

204
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,620
They're getting a variety pack for free for the PC version that's actually going to be offered

205
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,620
as part of a deal with Nvidia.

206
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,620
And it's coming two months after, of course, everyone got it on Xbox 360.

207
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,620
However, like I said, they don't have to pay for it.

208
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Creek and Chinatown are the highlights.

209
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,620
There are new arenas.

210
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,620
There's supposed to be Kill House and Broadcast.

211
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:02,620
And another one is Patch 1.6 that fixes a server crash exploit and a bunch of bugs.

212
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
So there you go.

213
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Hooray, bug fixes!

214
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Yay!

215
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
Bug report!

216
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Speaking of fixes and tweaks, there's going to be some new tweaks in line for Team Fortress 2.

217
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,620
The next class to be upgraded, I guess, would be the Pyro class.

218
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:28,620
They are giving them a brand new, I believe, an axe, which is going to be kind of neat.

219
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,620
Also, there are rumors that they're going to be introducing a sniper class as well.

220
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
So, that's neat.

221
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,620
I like to see games that they kind of tweak them as things come out to improve them and make them a little bit better.

222
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,620
But, unfortunately, I have not jumped on the bandwagon and haven't really played Team Fortress 2.

223
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Just mainly because, you know, I like a little single player in my multiplayer games.

224
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
But that's just me.

225
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,620
Anyways, the new weapon, as I was saying, is called the Extinguisher.

226
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:14,620
And I guess it's a weapon that deals half as much damage as a standard fire axe unless you use it against somebody engulfed in flames.

227
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,620
And it deals, I guess, a critical hit. So, that's kind of neat.

228
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,620
And then, like I said, one of the other things that they're going to be doing, I guess, is Meet the Sniper.

229
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,620
So, that's going to be a new character, hopefully.

230
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Wait, Meet the Sniper?

231
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,620
I was thinking of that movie.

232
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Meet the Parents.

233
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
No, no.

234
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Meet the Sniper.

235
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,620
They're doing it.

236
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
And maybe the sniper is already in the game.

237
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Maybe I'm just an idiot.

238
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Like I said, I don't play this game.

239
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,620
But they are giving the sniper an intro.

240
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,620
They did little intro videos for all the different classes that are in this game.

241
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,620
So, they have little funny videos that kind of explain what the class involves and that kind of thing.

242
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,620
You're not supposed to meet the sniper. They're just supposed to shoot you in the face when you're not looking.

243
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,620
Well, yes.

244
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,620
You can actually be shot in the face and live.

245
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
That is true.

246
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,620
So, a good sniper would aim for the neck or the forehead.

247
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,620
Alright, look.

248
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:24,620
Well, apparently a druid knew where to aim to kill Onyxia all by his little self.

249
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,620
Actually, it might have been a female druid, actually, that did this.

250
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,620
Let's see.

251
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Yeah, it was a female druid, Cyrenia, that did this.

252
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Was it really a female druid or was it a guy playing a female druid?

253
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Probably a guy playing a female druid, just like I am.

254
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Here's the deal. Onyxia, if you're not in the WoW, no.

255
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Onyxia used to be the boss of one of those 40-man raids.

256
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,620
She was a very, very difficult boss to fight and you had to get 40 people together to kill her.

257
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
Well, now, that was in the old WoW, before Burning Crusade.

258
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,620
Well, when Burning Crusade came out, everybody can get 10 levels higher.

259
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,620
And even though the old bosses supposedly got a little harder, I don't know.

260
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
I don't do a lot of old game content.

261
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,620
Apparently, it's much easier to get there now, getting through trash mobs.

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,620
This druid actually soloed Onyxia and was able to do it all by themselves and posted videos all over the internet.

263
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,620
And so, of course, what has to happen next right after that happens?

264
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
A paladin's got to go and do the same thing.

265
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:23,620
So, it's kind of like this druid threw down the gauntlet and then a paladin went and did the same thing.

266
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Went and slayed Onyxia all by themselves.

267
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,620
So, which is kind of a feat to kill what was once a 40-man boss all by your little self is kind of cool.

268
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,620
And I got to say, you guys have been listening to this show long enough.

269
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,620
You know that I'm getting more and more into WoW.

270
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,620
And I've been experiencing the endgame content in it, which is kind of new for me.

271
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,620
Because when I played Final Fantasy XI for all those years, I never got the endgame.

272
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
That was all a mystery for me.

273
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
But now I'm actually running the 10s and the 25s.

274
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
We've been in Serpent Shrine Cavern.

275
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,620
We've been in Tempest Keep.

276
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Now, granted, I haven't gotten to Sunwell yet.

277
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,620
But I feel like I'm making a lot more progression in this game than I ever did with any other MMO.

278
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
So, it's been very interesting.

279
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,620
The social dynamics of it is just...

280
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,620
These games are something else. Something else.

281
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,620
I would love to guest on a WoW show, by the way.

282
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,620
If you know of a Warcraft podcast that needs the Rob Roberts perspective, I'd love to go visit someday.

283
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Because WoW is fun to talk about.

284
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,620
But I'm not going to beat you over the head with it here on this show.

285
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:32,620
Well, in more World of Warcraft news, there is a 27-year-old gamer who is now in Deep Kaka.

286
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,620
He met this girl playing World of Warcraft.

287
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Fell in internet love.

288
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
And they ran away together.

289
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Less than three forever.

290
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Now the girl is 14.

291
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
Doh.

292
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Oopsie.

293
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,620
She said she was 18 online.

294
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,620
They're actually found in Franklin County, Washington in a campground.

295
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,620
In a campground? Like a KOA?

296
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Is that what it is? This guy and the girl ran off together to a KOA?

297
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
They went camping.

298
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
They were camping.

299
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Waiting for that spawn.

300
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,620
That was really good.

301
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,620
But, um, yeah.

302
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
That's just really sad.

303
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:31,620
I mean, but what really way is there to control if someone lies or not on the game, right?

304
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Well, I don't think they were lying.

305
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,620
I think she was just touched in the head and, you know, decided,

306
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
Hey, I'm going to go meet this guy.

307
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
He seems really nice.

308
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,620
But mom, I'm in love.

309
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Love does cause certain chemical reactions that have mimicked insanity.

310
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I'm not joking.

311
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,620
I don't know. I could see why he did that.

312
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,620
So what's the follow up? Is he in jail now or what happened?

313
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
Did they do it?

314
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
I don't know.

315
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Let me see.

316
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,620
It actually doesn't say. It says he's in legal trouble.

317
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
Here we go.

318
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
Well, he's in legal trouble. He must have crossed the line.

319
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,620
Um, there's likely what's really running away together is kind of just cross the line.

320
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,620
None of that physical stuff really even needs to be involved.

321
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,620
Well, it doesn't say what exactly he said.

322
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,620
Good old prison time coming in his way, it says.

323
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,620
But he's, I think, out on parole right now.

324
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Huh?

325
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
So the question is, will she wait for him?

326
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,620
And M 64 in chat changed his nickname to Chris Hansen and said, Hi there.

327
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,620
Why don't you have a seat right there?

328
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,620
Anyhow, now that's a dateline I'd like to see.

329
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Catching the wow predators.

330
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,620
He's got his hair slicked back. He's wearing a black T-shirt.

331
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,620
Yeah, it looks like it looks like the kind of guy who, uh,

332
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,620
and the sad thing is that I know people like this who just sit in front of their computer

333
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,620
and, you know, have a microwave right beside it and eat nothing but ramen.

334
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,620
You can't put a microwave next to your computer because it'll interfere with your speakers.

335
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,620
Got to put it a few feet away.

336
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,620
Bobby Blackwell has an obvious point I didn't even think about.

337
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
He says he crossed state lines with a minor. It's kidnapping.

338
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Yeah.

339
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
So that's why he's in trouble.

340
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,620
He should have done his research first, dumbass.

341
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
There's campgrounds all over the place.

342
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,620
Frisbee said, there's KOAs everywhere.

343
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Frisbee says, what level did she say she was?

344
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,620
I didn't say anything about it.

345
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
All right. She was over 18.

346
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,620
She told me she was 70.

347
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,620
All right. Well, anyway, people acting stupid and giving games like, wow, a bad name,

348
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
definitely make us a little bit angsty.

349
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,620
And when we hear about stupid people running away with 14-year-olds across state lines,

350
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
we get a little bit angsty.

351
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
And you know what that means?

352
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,620
It's time for a little segment we call F.U. of the Week.

353
00:18:49,620 --> 00:19:10,620
My F.U. of the Week.

354
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Well, really, I guess it's more, I guess, self-directed because I'm really nervous about something

355
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,620
that's going to be going on tomorrow.

356
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
And I want it to go well.

357
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,620
And I don't want to do my nervous habit of talking, like, wildly while this is going on out of nerves.

358
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,620
So F.U. to nerves.

359
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Just out of concern for the listeners, though, it's not medical.

360
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
You're not in, like, any type of...

361
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
I'm going in for a job interview, okay?

362
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Well, I just want to clarify.

363
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,620
People don't need to be worried about your health or anything.

364
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
You're fine there.

365
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,620
No, I don't have any type of degenerative diseases other than the walking pneumonia

366
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,620
and the bookies that you flew.

367
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
All right.

368
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
You didn't have to tell.

369
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
I just wanted to make sure the listeners didn't get worried.

371
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Loki.

372
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:02,620
I guess F.U. to stupid workers at Round Table for taking 40 minutes to make two-minute breadsticks.

373
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
What can I say?

374
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I used to work there, so I know how long it takes.

375
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
It does not take 40 minutes.

376
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,620
And God, hire some more intelligent people for your front counters.

377
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
I hated that shit.

378
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
My F.U. of the week goes to my tooth.

379
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,620
I've been having all this pain in my mouth, one of my teeth.

380
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
I know it's probably got to have a root canal or something.

381
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
It's got to be a bad situation.

382
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
It's been hurting a lot.

383
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
I don't think I've ever had a tooth hurt this bad.

384
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm, like, constantly having to take Tylenol or Advil or something.

385
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,620
And that means I'm actually going to have to go to the dentist on Monday.

386
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Now, here's the thing, you guys.

387
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,620
I just...

388
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
I don't like the dentist.

389
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
And a lot of people have those, like, fears of the dentist.

390
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
It's not that I'm necessarily afraid of the dentist.

391
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,620
I just hate the dentist because dentists are, like, used car salesmen.

392
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
They try to sell you stuff you don't need, I swear to God.

393
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,620
Not my dentist.

394
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,620
My last dentist, well, this is a true story about an experience I had with a dentist.

395
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Maybe it's just HMO versus PPO.

396
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Now that I have PPO, it'll be better.

397
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,620
But the last dentist I had tried to tell me I needed a replacement crown that was $1,200.

398
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,620
Now, granted, I did need the replacement crown,

399
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,620
but what they neglected to tell me was that my plan would also cover a crown that was only $300.

400
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
So they were purposely trying to rip me off.

401
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,620
You know how, like, how much that turns me off to dentists in general?

402
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Like, it makes me feel like I'm going to go buy a used car.

403
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,620
And I agree that, like, dental health is important and I'm a fucking moron for not going to the dentist more often.

404
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,620
But if that's the kind of treatment I'm going to get, do you understand why I don't like going?

405
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Exactly. I totally understand.

406
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,620
Let's see. Well, I'll tell you later.

407
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,620
I told you earlier that, you know, I'd recommend my dentist to you.

408
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Right.

409
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Because they've never...

410
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,620
And I haven't been to the dentist, except for this one, since I live, like, in the third grade,

411
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,620
because we didn't have insurance for that. We couldn't afford it.

412
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Right.

413
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,620
So, okay. Po.

414
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,620
But the dentist that I go to, they give you cookies when you leave.

415
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
Aww.

416
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,620
And they're good cookies.

417
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
How cute.

418
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,620
And the chairs, I fall asleep in their chairs. They're memory foam.

419
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,620
And both of them are professional, so they don't try to sell you shit you don't need.

420
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,620
They just put it out there and let you review it if you want it.

421
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
That's what I need. That's what I need.

422
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,620
When I got all of my fillings done, they said, you have...

423
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,620
Here's a composite. Here's this one. Here's this one. Here's this one.

424
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
This is what the pros and cons of this one are.

425
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
This is the pros and cons of this one.

426
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
That's perfect.

427
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Okay, if this... Now, see, I did end up... Before Jamie knew, I had problems.

428
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I just scheduled with somebody else. A coworker recommended him, and he's, like, right around the corner.

429
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
So, you know.

430
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,620
So I'm going to check it out and hope it's a little better, because what I like about this,

431
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,620
it's just one guy, his assistant, and the front desk lady, all in...

432
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,620
You know, it's not a big company, and those big companies tend to screw you more.

433
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Well, also, this one's not a big one, and also, if you go to my dentist, I get a $50 gift certificate for all of them.

434
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Motives.

435
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

436
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,620
But they do... But, you know, because they're a small business, they offer perks to their clients.

437
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,620
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Rob, my dad wouldn't do that to you.

438
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,620
See, that's awesome that, you know, we know somebody whose dad's a dentist.

439
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,620
I would go to a family or friend dentist in a heartbeat. I don't know any.

440
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,620
Unfortunately, SSJ100Matt's in New York City, and I can't exactly fly to New York to have my dental work done.

441
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,620
That's not very cost-effective.

442
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,620
So that's going to do it for the FUs of the week. Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

443
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,620
You know, and it doesn't really matter. I mean, we're not that rich yet to where we can fly out to New York to get your dental work done.

444
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,620
Maybe someday. When we are, you know, rich internet celebrities, I will totally fly out to New York just to see SSJ100Matt's dad.

445
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,620
Because at least I know I can, like, trust him, because Matt will put in a good word for me.

446
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Well, I'm not sure if this guy's a rich internet celebrity. I know he's probably a celebrity, at least in the gaming world.

447
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,620
But Nolan Bushnell, he has a biopic that's being made about him.

448
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,620
And, you know, must we forget that he also, you know, founded Chuck E. Cheese.

449
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Wait, they're making a biopic about Nolan Bushnell?

450
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Yes.

451
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,620
What's the story there? Just the fact that he invented all these things?

452
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,620
I mean, the story is Chuck E. Cheese is fucking awesome. Or was fucking awesome.

453
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
I stand corrected.

454
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
The pizza sucks ass.

455
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,620
It doesn't matter. They had cool arcades at one time.

456
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
In the 80s.

457
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,620
I say one time, because all those arcades have been replaced with neon lights and ticket redemption machines.

458
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
They had that Ferrari game. That Ferrari game's cool.

459
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Anyways, so apparently...

460
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,620
Dude, I should have my 30th birthday at Chuck E. Cheese. How awesome would that be?

461
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Apparently, Paramount Pictures has picked up the movie, and Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be attached to star in the movie as Nolan Bushnell.

462
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,620
That's kind of weird, in a way.

463
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
How does he look like...

464
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Makeup? I don't know.

465
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Wait, Black Wolf says, Sky, they won't let you. They won't let me.

466
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,620
What?

467
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,620
They won't let me.

468
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
You're a paying customer.

469
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,620
They won't let me have my birthday party. I've had some friends try. They got kicked out because they have no kids.

470
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
That's... It's not racist, but it's ageist.

471
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
It's because I'm gay.

472
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
No.

473
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
What?

474
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Why don't we invite people we know who have children?

475
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,620
Because I don't want no kids ruining my birthday party.

476
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,620
But people that we know would know how to raise their children, right?

477
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:17,620
I would take it to the management and just complain and then make a big fuss about it and get on the news.

478
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,620
Great. Then my fa... I would be the poster child for 30-year-olds wanting to have their birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.

479
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,620
I'm not sure I really, really want that.

480
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
You know what you do, Rob?

481
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
What?

482
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,620
You just don't tell them you're having your birthday party.

483
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Vandalous in chat says, Incredible Pizza Factory is more fun anyway.

484
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,620
I don't know if he's talking about John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

485
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,620
I don't know. Here's the thing with John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

486
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,620
I would agree that it's a pretty rad place and that the food is a slight step better, only slight.

487
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,620
You can't...

488
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,620
But here's the thing. There's no animatronic animals. And for that, it fails.

489
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,620
We could put Loki in a teagull costume.

490
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
That might be a little better.

491
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,620
I'm not an animatronic animal and normally I dress up in a teagull costume.

492
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,620
But it's my birthday!

493
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,620
I don't give a shit.

494
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Rob, Rob, Rob.

495
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,620
Ranma makes the best suggestion ever.

496
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
What?

497
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Dave and Busters.

498
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Too far! Too far!

499
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
I used to go every year.

500
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,620
I don't care.

501
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,620
I went to Disneyland last year.

502
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,620
I want to go to Disneyland for my birthday.

503
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Oh my god, Rob. Let's go to Disneyland.

504
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,620
Wait, Black Wolf finishes the story here. I know this has nothing to do with games, but I don't care.

505
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,620
Adults wanting to go to Chuck E. Cheese is a very important topic.

506
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,620
I mean, my friends were just trying to go there for lunch one day.

507
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,620
Company outing.

508
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,620
They were stopped at the door and told that they weren't welcome because they might have overrun the place for the kids.

509
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Dude, we went there in college once and they didn't say anything.

510
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
We went there on a weeknight once in college and they didn't say anything.

511
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
We've walked in the...

512
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
Don't ask me why.

513
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,620
Back when Qzar was open, someone actually ordered pizza from Chuck E. Cheese because they had takeout also.

514
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Why?

515
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
I don't know.

516
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,620
Who always said, mmm, mmm, I'm craving Chuck E. Cheese, crapola pizza?

517
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,620
I think it was mmm, mmm, I'm pole.

518
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,620
I have to say this.

519
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:11,620
And by the way, when I was in high school after I graduated, we decided to all go to Chuck E. Cheese's

520
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,620
and I got humped by the person playing Chuck E. Cheese.

521
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,620
He was also my boyfriend at the time.

522
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Oh, well, okay.

523
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,620
Ha! You were in the furries!

524
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
No.

525
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Oh, my God, you had sex with Chuck E. Cheese.

526
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,620
No.

527
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,620
It was...

528
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Furry lover!

529
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
It was silly.

530
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:36,620
But, you know, we went in there and, you know, I had a bunch of my friends there and, you know, we ate shitty pizza

531
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:42,620
and played skee-ball until we puked and it was fun and no one ever did shit about it.

532
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,620
CC's Pizza is an East Coast chain anyways.

533
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,620
There's a CC's.

534
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,620
Not around here.

535
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Oh, Black Wolf is around CC's Pizza. I've never heard of it.

536
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,620
There's a CC's Pizza.

537
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
They have this, like, thing that's on TV they're talking about.

538
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
My brother worked at CC's Pizza.

539
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,620
A buffet and stuff and it's like five bucks and the pizza looks like it's worth every penny.

540
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,620
It's like five dollar cardboard shit pizza.

541
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,620
DJ Morpheus says, there are times that Loki sounds like an animatronic animal.

542
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Well, I also have to say, Patty said in our chat room that she got kicked out of there when she was 18 and had a kid with her.

543
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Alright.

544
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
Jeez.

545
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
I have a better suggestion for you.

546
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
It's just cruddy.

547
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
It's not quite Chuck E. Cheese.

548
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,620
It's not quite...

549
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,620
Go to Scandia.

550
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,620
Not the Scandia in Sacramento, but the Scandia more towards Vallejo.

551
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,620
Okay.

552
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,620
That's where you need to go.

553
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Because there's no water park. There's no Super Ghetto Kids raining around. It's just arcade, go-karts, and golf. Like, God intended it.

554
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:43,620
And they have, like, tons of SNK machines and the Taito games.

555
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,620
I've never set foot in there. I drive by it every time I go to the bay.

556
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Oh my God, they're great.

557
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Is that what they actually advertise on the sign, Loki?

558
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Arcade, golf, and go-karts. The way God intended it.

559
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
That's the way it should be.

560
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,620
Alright.

561
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
So what, Leonardo DiCaprio, what?

562
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,620
He's gonna play, I guess, Nolan Bushnell. And I think the movie's actually entitled Atari, so...

563
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
Interesting.

564
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
Uh-huh.

565
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
Alright.

566
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Orange Lounge Fudio? No, now it's, like, Orange Lounge Chuck E. Cheesio.

567
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Uh, anyhow, let's go...

568
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,620
We were talking about games, okay? Games, Nolan Bushnell created Chuck E. Cheese. We were talking about Chuck E. Cheese.

569
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
It's still relevant.

570
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,620
This is a topic that always comes up on our show, actually, is whatever happened to awesome arcades?

571
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Right?

572
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Exactly.

573
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
It's a myth.

574
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Exactly.

575
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,620
They've fallen into obscurity.

576
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Well, it's sad that, you know, our kids are only gonna have to hear stories about, you know, the arcades.

577
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,620
It's gonna make it sound like, you know, when our parents told us about the sock-hop. Woohoo!

578
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't wanna ever hear about the sock-hop.

579
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Right.

580
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Okay, no more tangents, just...

581
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Are you sure? One more? You good for one more, Jamie?

582
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Come on, Tangent Lounge Radio.

583
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
That was the Ferret's Tangent.

584
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Continue!

585
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
You're withholding, I know it.

586
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
I am.

587
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Alright, EverQuest.

588
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
These are good cashews.

589
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
Orange Lounge EverQuest deal.

590
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
Here's the deal with EverQuest.

591
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Sony Online Entertainment, also known as SOE, or as I call it, S.O.E.

592
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,620
S.O.E. has reactivated all of the G.O.N. players.

593
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Basically, if you left, you know, if you abandoned EverQuest some time ago, S.O.E. has reactivated your account for two free months for both EverQuest and EverQuest 2.

594
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,620
That is everybody.

595
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,620
So if you left the game, it's time to come back.

596
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Here's the thing. S.O.E. also included all of EverQuest's expansions in those accounts.

597
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:38,620
And you get bonuses to help your players that are, you know, out of date, get them up to speed.

598
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,620
So, kinda interesting there. It's called the Living Legacy campaign.

599
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,620
So it's basically a way to try to sucker people back into EverCrack.

600
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Hey, it's two months for free. Just take a break from World of Warcraft and go grief some people. There you go.

601
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,620
You know what? EverQuest is one of those games I never really got into because I got into Final Fantasy XI instead.

602
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,620
Like, about the time I would have gotten into EverQuest, somebody showed me, like, Japanese Final Fantasy XI and I was like, ooh, I'm waiting for this.

603
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,620
It's Final Fantasy and it's online. What more do you want?

604
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Here's what I worry about. Final Fantasy is going to do something like this in the future and I'm going to be like, kind of want.

605
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Final Fantasy XIV.

606
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Kind of want.

607
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Actually, it's just Final Fantasy online or something.

608
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Alright. Anyhow.

609
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
Stuff.

610
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,620
Yes.

611
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,620
And nonsense.

612
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Like, this nonsense. No, I'm kidding.

613
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Can I read a comment from chat real quick? I gotta say it. Because it's about the arcade thing we're talking about.

614
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Sairan in chat says, I only hear stories about awesome arcades and it makes me cry that there are no more.

615
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:46,620
I guess we have to realize that there actually are, you know, I don't want to say younger kids, but, you know, teenagers that are now teenagers that were, like, you know, too young to remember when we were teenagers that are already going through this.

616
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,620
It kinda sucks.

617
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Yeah.

618
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,620
They will never know how awesome it was to stand on a booster seat to play Crystal Castles.

619
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Well, it's like even when I was in high school, and I'm sorry for going off on another little small thing.

620
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
It's what we do here.

621
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Because, you know, but when my little brother Matthew got hit by a car when he was six and I was still a freshman in high school.

622
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:14,620
And I remember, you know, being dropped off at the mall to go see a movie with my friend Jennifer and we went and hung out in the arcade.

623
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,620
Like, for hours!

624
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,620
Exactly! Tilt, they used to have tilts in the malls and stuff like that.

625
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,620
Which is now Hot Topic.

626
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,620
Well, Tilt got purchased by Namco.

627
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,620
I can tell you that because I worked for Namco Arcade when all this was going on.

628
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,620
But we had Aladdin's Castle inside, we actually got a cyber station later.

629
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,620
The Aladdin's Castle got turned into a cyber station and they opened an Aladdin's Castle in the mall across the street.

630
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
I worked at them both.

631
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Anyway, that was actually right around the time that arcade started, you know, sucking was when I quit working in one.

632
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,620
But anyway, I was there all day. I was playing Samurai Shodown 2.

633
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,620
We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that day.

634
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Rad.

635
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,620
Except that right when we beat the game they freaking turned off the machine.

636
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Fuckers.

637
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,620
Anyway, and these guys paid for me to play. It was awesome because they wanted to do a four person game.

638
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
They're like, here we have money.

639
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
Okay.

640
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
They paid you to do it four way?

641
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Oh baby.

642
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,620
I played Leonardo, so that's kind of cheating.

643
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,620
But anyway, and I can't believe I still remember.

644
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,620
It's because my brother was injured that that really stuck out in my mind.

645
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,620
But you know, we played, there's air hockey.

646
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Arcades, like only a few have air hockey anymore.

647
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
That is sad.

648
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
That is fucking criminal.

649
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,620
I mean, what arcade is perfect if you're not dodging air hockey pellets?

650
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Speaking of perfect arcade, and I apologize for a moment to our international audience.

651
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,620
This is a very local reference, but DJ Morpheus brought this up and I have to know if Jamie's ever been here.

652
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,620
What?

653
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Did you ever go to Sam's Town in Cameron Park when it was up and running?

654
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Oh yeah.

655
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,620
Oh my God, that place was incredible.

656
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Dan told me about the mine shaft.

657
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Oh, that was, oh, I miss arcades.

658
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
He said that part of it was underground.

659
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
Yes, the mine shaft, it was a golf course.

660
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,620
The golf course started underground.

661
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
It was like a mine shaft and you would go upstairs.

662
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
It would go above ground after like the first three holes.

663
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
I've seen the remnants of it.

664
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:11,620
There was also an part of the arcade where there was a two floor arcade upstairs had all the little kids games like Noah's arc and stuff.

665
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,620
And then downstairs, my God, they had everything, everything you can imagine.

666
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:21,620
You know what arcade, I think this is one of the last of the great arcades was the bird cage arcade that we had here.

667
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
No.

668
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
Cause the bird cage, I'm sorry for people.

669
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,620
I know this is way out of that, but this is where a lot of the new.

670
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
We're having a moment.

671
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Damn it.

672
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Bird cage arcade got all of the new fighting games.

673
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
All of them.

674
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,620
It didn't matter if they had to import them, they got them.

675
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:45,620
And, um, we actually, uh, well at the time, and I'm not going to say his name because a lot of people in the DDR community, especially doesn't, but a friend of ours, uh, worked for Capcom for awhile.

676
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:52,620
And it was funny watching him just completely hand people, their asses one handed, you know, at any of the fighting games.

677
00:34:52,620 --> 00:35:00,620
And it was just like, and that was like right when I first moved out here and then they started tearing down all the stuff that made the bird cage area cool.

678
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Like the theater where Rocky was and the arcade and they're trying to take out the element that was, they said they're trying to, to make it safer for better clientele.

679
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
But in reality, I think that it's hurt the business.

680
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,620
They're fucking rich white people ruining our culture.

681
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,620
I know, but is it just me or have you seen more business businesses there though?

682
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,620
Closed since keeping that place alive is the fact there's a Barnes and Noble.

683
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
I don't like it anymore.

684
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
There's no comic shop.

685
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:33,620
There's no bowling alley. There's no dollar store that sells t-shirts that say, fuck this.

686
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
And now international imports is going out of business.

687
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
That's sad.

688
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
I know one more thing I got to say about the local stuff.

689
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Sam's town.

690
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,620
Uh, DJ Morpheus says the mine shaft was like a third of the size of Sam town.

691
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,620
And that's true.

692
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Like, let me put it this way.

693
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,620
Sam's town.

694
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Like when you went to go spend your tickets, you spent them in a general store and you could buy like, you know, like those little candy cane things.

695
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Like some tastes like licorice and some tastes like mint.

696
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,620
Like you can spend, I mean, fond memories of that place.

697
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
That's shit.

698
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,620
Sam's town was like around since my mom was a child and stuff like that too.

699
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,620
I mean, all right.

700
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
And then they had to tear it down.

701
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Sorry for the moment of, as a, what, who is it in chat that said we were old people?

702
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Yeah.

703
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
Cason.

704
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, but you did call us old people.

705
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,620
It says an old person's moment.

706
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
All right.

707
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,620
No, it's just even the fact that we had awesome shit and you don't.

708
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Yes.

709
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
We're reminiscing about better times, kids.

710
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
All right.

711
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Except that I didn't walk to school both ways uphill.

712
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
So whatever.

713
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,620
All right.

714
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Sorry, Jamie.

715
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
You can do your story about a story, right?

716
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,620
Yeah.

717
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Strong bad game.

718
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,620
The game is called strong bad school game for attractive people made by telltale.

719
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,620
And it is going to be an episodic humor game.

720
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
But guess what?

721
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
It's delayed.

722
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:54,620
It's release has been pushed to July.

723
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
It doesn't.

724
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,620
Well, it says from June from the original release month into the next month.

725
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:05,620
So from June to July to polish it up a little bit.

726
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,620
And I really want to play this game because it's awesome.

727
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,620
And I love the trailers for it, but.

728
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,620
Well, it's obviously directed at me because it does say awesome people.

729
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
But here's this is attractive people.

730
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Here's the thing.

731
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
If you want to know a little more, that's me too.

732
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,620
If you want to know a little more about the real insight to what's going on here,

733
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,620
listen to the very end of Bobby Black Wolf show this week when we're on.

734
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
I'm not going to spoil it,

735
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,620
but he gives a little more insight as to what could be possibly up with this delay.

736
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
So I'll leave you with that little teaser.

737
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I will be sure to you do that right now.

738
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,620
Download it right now.

739
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,620
Go do it right now.

740
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Because we're broadcasting and I love fix our bandwidth.

741
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
So go now.

742
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
No.

743
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,620
Lucky saved the show from what you and I.

744
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,620
There is an interesting job posting over in Nintendo's official Web site.

745
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,620
The job posting was for a software hardware tester,

746
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,620
and their description of duties would be creating and executing a test plan for

747
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,620
Wiis USB devices.

748
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:10,620
And it goes on saying, you know, writing, testing, documentation, whatever.

749
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Anyways, but the whole fact is that there's going to be Wii USB devices.

750
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,620
Storage, perhaps?

751
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Hard drive?

752
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Hello?

753
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,620
OMG.

754
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Please?

755
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,620
That would be smart.

756
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,620
So cross your fingers that that's what that actually means.

757
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,620
I hope so.

758
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,620
DMN in chat says,

759
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Sky is so old he owes Nolan Bushnell a quarter.

760
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,620
Nice.

761
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,620
Asshole.

762
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Hey DarkSakura, you know what else I miss?

763
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
Roller rinks.

764
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,620
I've actually been to the one on Auburn, the Foothills skating rink,

765
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,620
like in the last couple of years.

766
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
I went there too.

767
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,620
And I'm still fucking awesome at it.

768
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
Alright.

769
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
I'm not going to let this show get derailed.

770
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,620
I'm just kidding.

771
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,620
Rob and I are going to go roller skating next week and video tape it.

772
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,620
I almost played DDR and roller skates once.

773
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,620
I thought you didn't want to be on camera.

774
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,620
I will be on camera.

775
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,620
I'll be video taping it.

776
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,620
Fine.

777
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
I said I wanted to go ice skating actually.

778
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
I've never been.

779
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
I hate ice skating.

780
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
Must happen.

781
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,620
I love ice skating.

782
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,620
Anyway.

783
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
Okay.

784
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Rob's story.

785
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Virtual Console.

786
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,620
SNK.

787
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
What more do you need to know?

788
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,620
There's lots of SNK stuff apparently heading to Virtual Console soon.

789
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,620
Not just Samurai Shodown as you heard in part A,

790
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,620
but apparently Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury 2, Burning Fight,

791
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,620
they are all apparently on their way to the Virtual Console.

792
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,620
This is the ESRB of course spilling all this.

793
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Also on the list, Dig Dug is on the list.

794
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,620
Now that's probably not the arcade version because you don't really see that on the Wii.

795
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,620
Probably the NES version because it didn't really come out anywhere else

796
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
that the Wii currently supports.

797
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,620
By the way, just so you know, also on the ESRB,

798
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,620
it's completely unrelated, PlayStation 3,

799
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,620
ratings for The Last Guy and Wipeout HD have both appeared

800
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,620
and hopefully that means that they are almost on their way.

801
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,620
So we'll be looking forward to seeing those games soon

802
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,620
because Wipeout is kind of cool.

803
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:07,620
For our Pokemon fans that are listening,

804
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,620
and I'm not going to say that Pokemon makes everything better,

805
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:18,620
but GameStop is going to be giving away a download of a free Pokemon.

806
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Forgive me if I mispronounce this, but Deoxys,

807
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,620
which is a psychic type Pokemon that has four different forms.

808
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,620
If you've got Pokemon Diamond or Pearl, you can go to a GameStop

809
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:39,620
and download it and then they'll harass you about pre-ordering stuff.

810
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,620
But hey, you can have Pokemons.

811
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,620
I know, it looks freaking bizarre.

812
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Very interesting comment from chat about kind of the tangent conversations we were having

813
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
and it comes from Sairan who was kind of commenting earlier

814
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
about being young and missing a lot of this.

815
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,620
It says something very interesting.

816
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,620
People robbed Jamie Matt's age, had awesome arcades.

817
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,620
People in the 60s, my mom's generation, had Woodstock,

818
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,620
the Beatles, the Summer of Love, and other cool things.

819
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,620
The majority of my generation just has the Iraq War, George Bush, and shitty music.

820
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,620
The Otaku demographic at least has somewhat of a boom of the anime industry,

821
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620
but that's about it.

822
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:19,620
That's a very, very good summary of it.

823
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
There's probably cool things about your generation,

824
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,620
but you're not really going to realize them until like 20 years later.

825
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,620
That's the thing is that right now in this 2000s,

826
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
have they ever come up with the name for the O's?

827
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
The O-O's or whatever?

828
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
The O's.

829
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
The O's.

830
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,620
Here in the O's, the 80s are making a comeback.

831
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
Just like how in the 90s, the 70s are making a comeback.

832
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
Here's the thing.

833
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,620
When we start getting into the 10s, the 90s will make a comeback

834
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620
and all those things you forgot about will be cool again.

835
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,620
So then again, it's going to be the late 60s, early 70s look again.

836
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,620
Perhaps.

837
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,620
Maybe in the 10s people are going to go back to the Victorian look,

838
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,620
which people kind of did in the early 80s now that I think about it.

839
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,620
It's kind of cool.

840
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Just something to think about.

841
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,620
I don't know.

842
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,620
Sometimes trends have a way of coming full cycle as folks that were teens become 30s.

843
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,620
I have to share this with you.

844
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,620
Sauce says it's the Ot.

845
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
I realize that's like the technical term for it,

846
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,620
but who really says that as freely as they say the 80s, the 90s?

847
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
You're not going to see it on VH1.

848
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
I love the Ot.

849
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
People in Europe?

850
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,620
I guess.

851
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,620
Because if I'm correct, zero is referred to as Ot.

852
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Alright, whatever, whatever.

853
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
Black Wolf brings up a good point.

854
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,620
In 20 years you may be telling young kids about how there was this internet

855
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,620
where you could look up anything and read about anything

856
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,620
and all the information was equal kind of referencing the net neutrality laws

857
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,620
that are kind of making waves this week.

858
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,620
That's true.

859
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
You guys did grow up in the internet age.

860
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
That is something.

861
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,620
We didn't really have that when I was in early high school.

862
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,620
It was BBS is for life, bitch.

863
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,620
When we were some of these people's age,

864
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:09,620
the internet actually was still military only and illegal for anyone else to network.

865
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,620
You totally just said when I was your age.

866
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
I understand though.

867
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,620
When we were little, it was true.

868
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:25,620
The internet has been in existence since, I do believe, 1972 or 74 around that time.

869
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,620
Whenever Al Gore invented it, right?

870
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,620
Whenever.

871
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,620
But it was military use only, and if anyone was caught networking

872
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:37,620
like in the early 80s or so, they actually could be arrested for it.

873
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:44,620
I remember my friend's dad who is in his 60s now is an engineer,

874
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,620
and he was talking about lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.

875
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,620
I thought that was pretty crazy.

876
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,620
Yeah, anyway.

877
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,620
All right.

878
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,620
Just thought that might be a little perspective.

879
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,620
Lots of reminiscing tonight.

880
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

881
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
Sorry, kids.

882
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,620
Well, a show that likes to reminisce as well, Video Games Live,

883
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,620
will be coming, or they have announced actually 50 different shows for their world tour.

884
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,620
Of course, Video Games Live, for those who may not remember,

885
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,620
is the show that has all sorts of orchestrated music from video games,

886
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,620
including Legend of Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, et cetera.

887
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,620
This year though, I'm glad to see that it looks like around August

888
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,620
they're going to be coming towards San Jose, so we'll be able to hit that up actually.

889
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:46,620
All over the place, including Canada, France, Scotland, the United States, Portugal, Brazil,

890
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:53,620
China, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Moscow, Russia, and Norway and Sweden.

891
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,620
So when they say world tour, they don't mean just like US and Canada.

892
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,620
They mean the freaking world.

893
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,620
Yes.

894
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,620
That's pretty cool.

895
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,620
That'd be fun to travel on.

896
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Like I said, for those folks local to Orange Lodge Radio here,

897
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:12,620
August 26th you've got San Jose at the Performing Arts Center during the Envision 08.

898
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,620
That convention's going to be going on.

899
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,620
And then also they're coming back around again in San Francisco.

900
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,620
No date on that though.

901
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,620
So, awesome.

902
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,620
Sorry, I was distracted because they're telling Commodore 64 jokes in chat,

903
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:35,620
and that's just all kinds of awesome.

904
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,620
But not as awesome as-

905
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,620
I used to play kicks on an Apple IIe.

906
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,620
But look, Commodore 64 and Apple IIe, not nearly as awesome as boobs.

907
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,620
And that's what the next story is about.

908
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,620
It's about boobs.

909
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,620
Mine are pretty awesome.

910
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
We have to talk about boobs in Age of Conan.

911
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,620
Here's something kind of interesting.

912
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,620
Apparently what happened is that suddenly one day in Age of Conan,

913
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,620
all the boobs like disappeared.

914
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,620
Well, they didn't like disappear, but they got really tiny.

915
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,620
I guess all the boobs shrink.

916
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,620
They shrank.

917
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,620
Apparently what happened, code from an earlier patch actually went into a new patch,

918
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,620
and it caused the morph values for certain models in the game to become altered.

919
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,620
And the only thing that people seem to be noticing though are the boobs.

920
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,620
The boobs have their own value?

921
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,620
What?

922
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,620
That's awesome.

923
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Apparently people notice, and they actually have before and after shots here on various websites.

924
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,620
Well, you know what that means.

925
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,620
If something can be shrunk, it can be made bigger.

926
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,620
This is what I love, is that the company actually posted a clarification saying,

927
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,620
quote, your breasts should be back to normal soon.

928
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,620
Well, thank you for saving the day.

929
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,620
Wow.

930
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,620
By the way, it should be noted, man boobs were not affected at all.

931
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,620
Wow.

932
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,620
Man boobs were safe.

933
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,620
Also safe this week, your emails, but not for much longer,

934
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,620
because we're about to turn Dark Sakura loose on them.

935
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,620
But not for very much longer?

936
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:04,620
Not for very much longer.

937
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,620
I've got to open the mailbag.

938
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,620
No, I am.

939
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,620
Mailbagorangelaungeradio.com, here we go, Dark Sakura, take it away.

940
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,620
Stuff.

941
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,620
This is the best, this is like my email of the week just because of how it ends.

942
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,620
Hey Rob and Dark Sakura, how goes it?

943
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,620
What about Loki?

944
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,620
Say hi to Loki too.

945
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,620
F Loki.

946
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,620
My name is Taibon and I'm currently living in Kenya with my sisters.

947
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,620
I'm sorry, I'm not going to think of power thirst.

948
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,620
The region here is really poor, but we're fortunate enough to be able to afford

949
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,620
and import video games from Europe.

950
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,620
We finally got hold of Grand Theft Auto and I've been enjoying it a lot.

951
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,620
I don't have much to say, just wanted to say hi

952
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,620
and let you guys know that you've got listeners all around the world.

953
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,620
I've been listening to the podcast every week for the past year now

954
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,620
and it's one of my favorites, Keep Up The Good Work, Taibon.

955
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:58,620
This message is brought to you by Samara's Cafe, home of the never-ending dirt.

956
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,620
That's what I thought was awesome.

957
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,620
P.S., hope you read my email on the show.

958
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,620
It'll definitely make my week.

959
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,620
Okay, look, I think you totally just got punked.

960
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,620
Here's the reason why.

961
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,620
Look, because I saw that email sitting in there.

962
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,620
Look at the sender name.

963
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,620
It does not match the person who says they are.

964
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,620
I know.

965
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:22,620
However, the reason why I thought it was awesome was because of the never-ending dirt.

966
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,620
I want this person to prove that they're actually in Kenya somehow.

967
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,620
Send us a picture of Kenya.

968
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,620
You need to be standing in front of a building flying the Kenya flag.

969
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,620
No.

970
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,620
Making a gang sign or something.

971
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,620
I don't know.

972
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,620
Making the OLR gang sign, whatever that is.

973
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,620
Take us a picture of Samara's Cafe.

974
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,620
Oh, yes, we want a picture of Samara's Cafe.

975
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,620
There you go.

976
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,620
Perfect.

977
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Perfect.

978
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
And the never-ending dirt.

979
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,620
Yes.

980
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,620
But the other reason I'm thinking it's awesome is I'm also thinking of power thirst now.

981
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,620
And then I'm thinking, why would someone send us, and I apologize if we're not getting punked.

982
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,620
Just realize my suspicions.

983
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,620
A couple things about your email.

984
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,620
Raise some eyebrows.

985
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,620
Why would you punk us with that?

986
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
You crazy kids.

987
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
Well, I'm thinking that it could be a nickname too.

988
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,620
So I'm going to suspend, you know.

989
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Well, that's right.

990
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,620
And I apologize profusely if you are the real deal.

991
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,620
If you are a legitimate person that lives in Kenya, you know what?

992
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,620
Actually, I'm going to save the email and I'm going to run it through an IP hunt.

993
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,620
Yeah.

994
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,620
Oh, there you go.

995
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,620
There you go.

996
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:29,620
Not that we are coming out and saying it was just that we never expected to get email from Kenya.

997
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,620
But then again, we have a caller who calls from...

998
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,620
We get Sweden.

999
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,620
We get Argentina.

1000
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,620
We get...

1001
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,620
Why not Kenya?

1002
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,620
I know.

1003
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,620
Why not?

1004
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,620
I want somebody from Wales to call me so I can listen to a sexy Welsh accent.

1005
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,620
Next email.

1006
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,620
Okay.

1007
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,620
Just a quick...

1008
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,620
Okay, this is from Robert M.

1009
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,620
Just a quick thought about the Wii storage.

1010
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,620
In addition to download virtual console and WiiWare titles,

1011
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,620
game saves seem to take a pretty big chunk of hard drive space.

1012
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:00,620
Elibits, for instance, uses about 100 blocks and Brawl save files well over 120.

1013
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,620
I assume that EA Sports games use large blocks as well,

1014
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,620
as most likely will the upcoming Animal Crossing game,

1015
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,620
the GameCube one actually fills an entire grey memory card

1016
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,620
and comes with a spare card for that reason.

1017
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:19,620
And if it's a game that uses WFC and you can't move the save to your SD card for backup,

1018
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,620
I have no idea what should be done about...

1019
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,620
I'm sorry, I have no idea what should be done about this.

1020
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,620
How many free blocks does a clean Wii with nothing but the disc channel

1021
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,620
and no game saves have anyway?

1022
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,620
I have Mario Kart Wii from my Gamefly list and I haven't gotten online with it yet

1023
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,620
since I've been busy with other things, mostly Dr. Mario Online RX.

1024
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,620
So anyone there or in OLR me has a chance to compete in that one?

1025
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,620
He has a good question. I'm actually not sure.

1026
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,620
How many blocks come on a brand new Wii? Isn't it like 1400 about?

1027
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,620
Maybe the chat room goes a little bit...

1028
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,620
I don't know. I think blocks are stupid for measurement anyways on there.

1029
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,620
True that.

1030
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,620
Just fucking kilobytes, man. That's what everybody uses nowadays.

1031
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,620
Megabytes.

1032
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,620
Gigabyte?

1033
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,620
You know, it's something that people can understand.

1034
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,620
This game takes a terabyte of saving space.

1035
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,620
Yeah, instead of Microsoft points and shit like that.

1036
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,620
Well...

1037
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,620
It's hard.

1038
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,620
Anyway, next email.

1039
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,620
Yes, Preeze?

1040
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
Hey, DarkSakuraSky and Loki.

1041
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,620
Hey.

1042
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,620
I was just saying hey.

1043
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,620
Hey.

1044
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,620
Hey!

1045
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,620
I'm a long time listener from Canada known as D.Vay in the chat room.

1046
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,620
Hi.

1047
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,620
Hey, Jamie.

1048
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,620
What do gay horses eat?

1049
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
Hey!

1050
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,620
Okay, I'm not gonna do the other joke.

1051
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,620
So yes, listener from Canada.

1052
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,620
Okay.

1053
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,620
I know Loki is all into PSP hacks and homebrew stuff like that,

1054
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,620
but recently I just bought myself a DS with a flash cart that I ordered online.

1055
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,620
You got a ninja pass!

1056
00:51:54,620 --> 00:52:00,620
Anyway, my question to Loki is have you experience with DS homebrew before or do you even give a shit?

1057
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:05,620
And so do you have any good links that can guide me in the right passage?

1058
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,620
Thanks guys for making my weekly days and...

1059
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,620
Weekly days? Okay.

1060
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,620
And keep up the good work.

1061
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:14,620
By the way, I was gonna submit a GTA radio entry if it weren't for my MacBook crapping out on me.

1062
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,620
This message has been brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending flow of saggy granny birthday parties.

1063
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,620
Nice.

1064
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,620
You know what? Fear not.

1065
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
I'm still trying to get that Portal win.

1066
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,620
I am told that All Games is going to be stepping up the number of contests that they do.

1067
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,620
So there will be more opportunities to get in on the fun and big prizes eventually.

1068
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:37,620
We should have like a best message brought to you by contest for our emails.

1069
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,620
We do have some stuff to give away and I think we're gonna do it next week.

1070
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,620
Okay.

1071
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,620
I have an idea.

1072
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,620
Okay. Uh-oh. Let's hide.

1073
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:54,620
But no, I still meant to download Still Alive and my week has just been in utter chaos so I haven't had a chance to do it yet.

1074
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:02,620
But I do have a Ninja Pass so as soon as I can find my SD card reader then I will be making use of the downloads and I will let you know what I think.

1075
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,620
No, I plan on buying one of these. I'm poor right now so I can't.

1076
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,620
So yeah, that's the only problem right now.

1077
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:18,620
Oh, I know someone who does regular shipments of them because if you order like ten of them you get free shipping or something.

1078
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,620
So next time this goes on I'll let you know.

1079
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,620
Well, it still doesn't make me not poor.

1080
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,620
But yeah, I plan on buying one because I mean they look cool.

1081
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:34,620
My whole thing before was if I was ever going to buy one it was just to play import games on anyways.

1082
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,620
Because I'm not going to buy every fucking import game out there.

1083
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:45,620
In fact, most of the games I do play on my PSP that are not legit are just to try them out so I can talk about them on the show.

1084
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,620
And I don't intend on keeping them because fuck, I don't play my PSP really right now anyways.

1085
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,620
I just play more of my 360 and Grand Theft Auto.

1086
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,620
But yeah, that's pretty much the only interest I have on that stuff.

1087
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,620
So yeah, we for that matter play all import games sometimes.

1088
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,620
I don't even really play that many import games.

1089
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:08,620
Just mainly, well I play Mario Kart but that's not import so.

1090
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,620
There you go.

1091
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,620
Actually, I'm going to be importing a game.

1092
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,620
What could that be?

1093
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:19,620
Because I have a new 2DX controller. I'm actually thinking about importing Happy Sky.

1094
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,620
Really?

1095
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,620
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

1096
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:28,620
Because you know, I've been wanting to get back into playing 2DX because I used to, I wasn't nearly as good as you are but.

1097
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
I was talking about that the other week actually.

1098
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:35,620
But I've got, I can start, I actually have two of the same kind of controller now and can do double.

1099
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,620
I've been trying to learn double.

1100
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:43,620
You know I still have all those arcade parts that I remember how I was going to build the controllers for the 2DX and pop music and all that stuff.

1101
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
Still have all those.

1102
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,620
I would pay you to build me an arcade style controller.

1103
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,620
For pop music?

1104
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,620
No for, well for pop music yeah too because I have a bunch of pop music too.

1105
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,620
I have the full size buttons for it. They're like 8 bucks each. Sucks.

1106
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:04,620
Well, next email comes from one of our listeners in the UK.

1107
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,620
Hi OLR, it's Guy.

1108
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,620
Hi Guy.

1109
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,620
Hi Guy.

1110
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:12,620
I once sent you a letter regarding what time I could listen live to the show. I'm in the UK.

1111
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:18,620
Now I'm back with another England slash America question. I want to know what the reception for GTA 4 was in America.

1112
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:23,620
It was really hyped in England but everyone forgot about it when it came out because it was exactly the same as the others.

1113
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Was it the same in America? I'm sorry if it's been covered but I've had school exams and haven't listened to the cast recently.

1114
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,620
Pip pip guy.

1115
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,620
He said pip pip. That's cute.

1116
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,620
Well we did kind of talk about it in part A that worldwide they've sold 8.5 million.

1117
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Was that worldwide or just here in America that they sold 8.5 million?

1118
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,620
It was probably worldwide.

1119
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,620
I think it's worldwide.

1120
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:51,620
11 million have gone to store shelves so it's been doing very well and I would tend to once say the majority of that is happening in America.

1121
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:59,620
And no I'm not really hearing a lot of it's too much like the others. I think honestly if it is too much like the others that's okay for a lot of people here.

1122
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:09,620
Well honestly and you know me I wasn't at all interested in Grand Theft Auto 4 but Dan's been borrowing our friend George's copy for a while and he's been kind of getting into it.

1123
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:17,620
You know actually doing the missions and his friend Will's been just you know fucking off on everything in that game and doing whatever the hell he wanted to and trying to get as drunk as possible.

1124
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,620
He got so drunk on his character that he couldn't walk. I thought it was funny.

1125
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:28,620
But anyway I've actually kind of gotten into watching them play it just because you know I like picking out stuff.

1126
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,620
Like the piss water reference that cracked me the hell up.

1127
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,620
Here's something else to consider. Grand Theft Auto has been selling systems here.

1128
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,620
It has.

1129
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:43,620
PlayStation 3's especially. I don't know if it's name recognition or what but there's a lot of people that have been picking up PS3's just for this game.

1130
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,620
The Sony Grill.

1131
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:50,620
And Blu-ray player too. They go oh it plays Blu-rays and Grand Theft Auto 1.

1132
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,620
And it cooks burgers.

1133
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,620
So there you go.

1134
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,620
Thank you Guy.

1135
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,620
Bye Guy.

1136
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,620
Bye Guy.

1137
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,620
Hey guys and girl.

1138
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,620
Pip pip.

1139
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,620
Thank you. I know I'm awesome. I get my own hello.

1140
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,620
Anyway I have been listening for about four years. Oh God four years.

1141
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,620
And I hardly ever email you but I thought this was worth it.

1142
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:15,620
I work in an office job and often listen to music and one time I decided I should listen to your podcast at work.

1143
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:20,620
It entertained me so well for the three hours that it makes the rest of the day pass by incredibly slowly.

1144
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,620
Not just and not even my music is working anymore.

1145
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,620
I have even dipped into some archives just to have something to listen to that good.

1146
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:33,620
I tried a few other podcasts but nothing compared to keep up the good work. I love the tangents and never let them end.

1147
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,620
Well you got a lot of them tonight.

1148
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,620
Plus he has the best email ever.

1149
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,620
And.

1150
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,620
Sorry Jamie had to whisper that to me so we did not give out the poor guy's email address.

1151
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,620
But that is a pretty radical.

1152
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,620
That's hard core dude. Hard core.

1153
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,620
Like Itagaki is probably going to kick your ass for taking that name.

1154
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
He wants it.

1155
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,620
He wants your email bad.

1156
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,620
I got to say though we've actually kind of heard a lot about.

1157
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,620
In fact when when because Part B has been kind of late the past two weeks and that's my fault.

1158
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,620
And I've actually been kind of getting flack from the people who listen to us at work.

1159
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Like why weren't we up for them to listen to Thursday or Friday at work.

1160
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:17,620
So I know there's a lot of people that use us to pass the day by at work and I really really apologize for that.

1161
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,620
Of course we are only three hours of show a week.

1162
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,620
You know hopefully maybe one day we'll be able to put out a little more other specials and things.

1163
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:29,620
But if you're looking for other shows that are quality check out our family at all games dot com.

1164
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,620
There's some great shows there. Will you like all of them.

1165
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,620
Probably not because the shows all talk about different types of games.

1166
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,620
You know and there's.

1167
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:42,620
But that's kind of what makes the network cool is that you have different gamer bases talking about all different types of things.

1168
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,620
There's bound to be at least one other show on there you're like.

1169
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,620
What were you laughing at Loki.

1170
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,620
Nothing.

1171
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,620
What is this.

1172
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,620
Read an email dark soccer I have to spy on Loki and see what he's watching.

1173
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,620
I do want to thank Rob with two B's who sent us presents.

1174
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,620
For our sixth anniversary.

1175
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:09,620
And I will check them out in a bit but I wanted to thank you very much for sending us your my cook rewards.

1176
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,620
Yes and I saw that too.

1177
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:16,620
So big thank you. We will definitely figure out a way to work those in to our anniversary show.

1178
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,620
Here's the thing he's watching that is really Tiger Claw was telling me about this before the show.

1179
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,620
But someone has done a shot for shot remake of the introduction to the naked gun.

1180
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,620
But in Grand Theft Auto 4 using the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine they have recreated the intro to the naked gun.

1181
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,620
And Loki's laughing his ass off.

1182
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,620
I'm going to have to look for that when I get home Tiger Claw give you the link.

1183
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,620
Just Tiger Claw send it to the mailbag.

1184
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,620
So Jamie can look it up at home.

1185
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,620
Thanks.

1186
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:53,620
Hey guys I'm about to get a 360.

1187
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:58,620
If I like first person shooters what would I get except for the obvious ones.

1188
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,620
Any other game recommendations will be thanked.

1189
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,620
Thanks.

1190
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,620
Keep up the great work.

1191
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,620
I'm sorry what system was it.

1192
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,620
360.

1193
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,620
360 first person shooters.

1194
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,620
Call of Duty 4.

1195
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:16,620
I don't know you kind of when you say besides the obvious ones.

1196
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Well the obvious ones are the good ones usually.

1197
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,620
That's why they're kind of obvious.

1198
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,620
So you kind of I don't know.

1199
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,620
I guess you know you're probably asking the wrong people.

1200
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,620
Because I don't think a lot of us are super into first person shooters as much as we are say RPGs and adventure games.

1201
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,620
I'm really not myself.

1202
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,620
But I will say this orange box.

1203
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,620
If you overlook that some great first for not just portal but half life.

1204
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,620
Half Life 2.

1205
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,620
Half Life 2 is freaking great.

1206
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,620
It's like the best first person shooter deal.

1207
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,620
It's a better deal than Halo.

1208
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,620
Because Halo is just one game.

1209
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,620
Orange box is like five.

1210
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,620
Otherwise I know I might take a little flack for saying this.

1211
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,620
And it's not really for hardcore first person players.

1212
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,620
But I liked Prey.

1213
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,620
There was a lot about Prey I liked.

1214
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,620
Sauce is Iron Man.

1215
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,620
And I think.

1216
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,620
Okay.

1217
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:02,620
I think one reason that I liked Prey was that since you couldn't really die in it.

1218
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,620
Like it was kind of a first person shooter for dummies.

1219
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,620
The only problem with Prey is that it ended a little early.

1220
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,620
But the music was awesome because it's.

1221
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,620
What's his name?

1222
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,620
Jeremy Sole.

1223
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,620
Sole or something like that.

1224
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,620
Jeremy Sole.

1225
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,620
The same guy who did the music for Oblivion.

1226
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,620
Did the music for Prey.

1227
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,620
The music is great.

1228
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,620
And it's like ten bucks probably at this point.

1229
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,620
So.

1230
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,620
Okay.

1231
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,620
There's my recommendation I guess.

1232
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:30,620
Well I was checking this and I think that it's because the Kenya email was a Gmail account.

1233
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,620
It's reading an America IP.

1234
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,620
Mm hmm.

1235
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:40,620
But Google is international and they do run out of the United States.

1236
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,620
So.

1237
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,620
We'll see.

1238
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,620
Send us a picture.

1239
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,620
We're waiting for the picture of the cafe.

1240
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,620
Or either.

1241
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,620
Look.

1242
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,620
Either send us a picture of the cafe or fess up that you were fake.

1243
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,620
And just tell us why.

1244
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,620
I mean we don't care at this point.

1245
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,620
We read the email.

1246
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,620
But I've got to know why that.

1247
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,620
Why did she have to read that.

1248
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,620
I mean was it a dare.

1249
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,620
I don't get it.

1250
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,620
All right.

1251
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,620
Anything else?

1252
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,620
I'm checking the inbox to see if we got it right.

1253
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,620
No but we did get one.

1254
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,620
This is pokey man's.

1255
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,620
I'm going to read next week.

1256
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,620
All right.

1257
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,620
So tune in next week for more mailbag.

1258
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:14,620
Hey speaking of interactivity the Skype line will be open very soon but we got two more

1259
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,620
stories for you before you get the Skype line which we're kind of keeping short tonight

1260
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,620
we're trying to keep our show a little short tonight because we've got other things we

1261
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:24,620
got to get to for tomorrow but we will get at least a couple of calls in after these

1262
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,620
two quick stories looking.

1263
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,620
Well home is coming out this year.

1264
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,620
So says Sony.

1265
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,620
But.

1266
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:39,620
They say now it's going to be released in the fall as an open open working beta.

1267
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,620
I guess that's a fancy way of saying well it's not really done yet but we're releasing

1268
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,620
it anyways.

1269
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,620
Really when they think about it I guess it's kind of like every single game that comes

1270
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,620
out nowadays anyway.

1271
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:53,620
Well also you know there's a lot of pretty much anything Google does and Google launches

1272
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:58,620
is a beta you know so is it kind of like that thing where it's like well we're launching

1273
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,620
this and it's going to have all these awesome features but don't blame us if it sucks because

1274
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,620
it's a beta.

1275
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:07,620
No I don't think so that that's that may work for Google because they're always improving

1276
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,620
their services and stuff.

1277
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,620
When it comes to a game company it means we're not done yet but we need to release this

1278
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:17,620
otherwise you're going to get really pissed off at us anyways because I mean same with

1279
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:23,620
games you know there is a big story going out about grid for the Xbox 360 having horrible

1280
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,620
freezing issues.

1281
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,620
Oops we didn't finish it so now we got to finish on the back end.

1282
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,620
I mean that's what it all comes down to anyways because they need to get it out you know as

1283
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:38,620
soon as possible to meet their marketing campaign or whatever whatever at least it's coming

1284
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,620
out I guess and either way people have been playing it in beta.

1285
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:46,620
I don't know I don't to be honest I don't think home is going to be as big as they're

1286
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,620
hoping it's going to be.

1287
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,620
I think people are going to find it as being a big waste of time.

1288
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,620
But we'll see.

1289
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,620
Sorry for the dead air there I was typing some things in chat real quick.

1290
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,620
He was typing of the dead.

1291
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,620
Yes I was typing of the dead and I won.

1292
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,620
I got a hundred percent.

1293
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:10,620
Resident Evil 5 you know they've kind of been accused of being a racist and so on.

1294
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,620
I don't know if you heard about that but you know because in the trailers and stuff you

1295
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,620
know whatever.

1296
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:19,620
But here's the thing is that the producer of Resident Evil 5 Jun Takushi has actually

1297
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:23,620
denied saying there is nothing racist about this game you all are just misunderstanding

1298
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,620
the original trailer which I would believe because people are too freaking sensitive

1299
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,620
nowadays.

1300
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,620
Come on.

1301
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,620
Anybody can be a zombie regardless of race.

1302
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,620
Can we all agree on that.

1303
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,620
I agree.

1304
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,620
Oh go ahead.

1305
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,620
The very first Resident Evil had zombies of all.

1306
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,620
By the time they all grayed out they look the same anyway so it doesn't matter.

1307
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:50,620
You know they had to edit the US one because of the zombie biting the head off of some

1308
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,620
guy who looked like Michael Jordan.

1309
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,620
What?

1310
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,620
Yeah.

1311
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:59,620
In the Japanese biohazard when you go you know when you go in the room and you get the

1312
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,620
I hope this is not Chris's bloodline and everything.

1313
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,620
And so you go into the other room.

1314
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:09,620
There's a zombie chewing off the neck of one of the team members who had been in there

1315
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,620
before and his head pops off and rolls off.

1316
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,620
And it looks like Michael Jordan.

1317
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,620
They were supposed to.

1318
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:23,620
And however PS1 graphics did they cut that out on the US version in that in that cinematic.

1319
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:28,620
They also cut out the part with with Chris lighting up a cigarette you know with this

1320
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:34,620
huge lighter which I've got a Japanese version of biohazard.

1321
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,620
So it's not no big freakin deal.

1322
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:41,620
But I thought that that was you know it's the same thing.

1323
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:45,620
Well I mean speaking of like characters and stuff there are going to be there is a new

1324
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:49,620
character in the game who is a black female is going to have a role in Resident Evil 5

1325
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,620
is somebody you can actually include.

1326
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,620
And see here's the thing is that the question was asked did you put this character in because

1327
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,620
of the fact that you know the trailer showed that you're you know blowing up people in

1328
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,620
Africa and that they're all the zombies and stuff.

1329
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:05,620
And to go she said no she's pretty much been there in the beginning.

1330
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,620
In terms of the reaction we're in the business of entertainment.

1331
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,620
We didn't set out to make a racist game or a political statement.

1332
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,620
We did feel there was a misunderstanding about the initial trailer which probably was just

1333
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:21,620
some people being a little bit oversensitive I think because you know anybody can be a

1334
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:26,620
zombie right.

1335
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,620
We don't see a lot of fat zombies in Resident Evil do you.

1336
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,620
Yes you do.

1337
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,620
Do you.

1338
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:38,620
There was a cop in the first one who died and then he came back as a fat zombie.

1339
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,620
OK.

1340
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,620
I know my video game trivia.

1341
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,620
All right.

1342
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,620
All right.

1343
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,620
We're going to go to the Skype line here one eight seven seven game O.L.R.

1344
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,620
But first I'm told that there is a very important voicemail we're supposed to play that was

1345
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,620
left in the box last night.

1346
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:58,620
And I'm just thinking about what goes on Saturday overnight.

1347
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:02,620
No I'm thinking about things that go on on all games radio on Saturday night.

1348
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:07,620
And I'm a little bit worried about this one so I'm going to go play this voicemail and

1349
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,620
kind of hope that it's not too strange.

1350
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,620
We'll see.

1351
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:42,620
It's downloading.

1352
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,620
I remember that.

1353
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,620
That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.

1354
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,620
I remember that commercial.

1355
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,620
That's 30 seconds of all your lives you'll never get back either.

1356
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,620
Well every second of your life is a second you'll never get back.

1357
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,620
Tiger Claw says we just got bucket rolled.

1358
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,620
What the crap.

1359
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,620
Is that the new thing now.

1360
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,620
Is that replaced Rick rolling.

1361
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,620
By the way.

1362
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,620
By the way I went to a sushi restaurant last night.

1363
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,620
My friend Jim is his birthday is turning 30.

1364
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Happy birthday Jim if you're listening.

1365
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,620
Here's the thing.

1366
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,620
They actually have a sushi roll called the Rick O roll.

1367
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,620
Can you believe that they actually now have sushi called the Rick roll.

1368
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,620
Did you get a.

1369
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,620
Screw all of you.

1370
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:30,620
Don't they have Ricky O as like a Asian kung fu.

1371
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,620
I don't know.

1372
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,620
But I just.

1373
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:35,620
But of course the whole table looked at it went ha ha ha Rick roll ha ha ha.

1374
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:38,620
And I was just like Rick rolls need to die in a boat fire.

1375
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,620
Underwater one thing.

1376
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,620
All right.

1377
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,620
We got calls.

1378
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,620
We got calls.

1379
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,620
Let's go to the Skype line.

1380
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,620
Hi you're on orange on radio.

1381
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,620
Who's this.

1382
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,620
Ravens dolphin.

1383
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,620
Long time no here.

1384
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,620
Well hello Ravens dolphin.

1385
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:54,620
Damn it's been a long time since you've managed to be the first caller here on OLR.

1386
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,620
What is on your mind.

1387
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,620
My friend.

1388
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,620
First off what the hell have you been up to.

1389
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,620
Dead Pixel Live.

1390
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,620
Oh yeah.

1391
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,620
You do a show every day here on all games.

1392
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,620
So you're like Monday through Thursday.

1393
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,620
Right.

1394
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,620
Yep.

1395
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,620
It's close enough to be in every day.

1396
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,620
How do you guys go.

1397
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,620
How long is that show.

1398
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,620
Two and a half hours after all games interactive.

1399
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,620
What in God's name do you talk about for two and a half hours every day.

1400
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,620
Whatever the hell we talk about.

1401
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,620
Sometimes we can talk about car chases.

1402
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,620
Sometimes we can talk about we fit.

1403
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,620
It's just a potpourri of whatever.

1404
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,620
All right.

1405
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,620
Well there you have it here on all games radio.

1406
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,620
What time do you start.

1407
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,620
You just start whenever all games finishes.

1408
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,620
Yeah.

1409
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,620
Whenever they reach at and they said all right.

1410
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,620
They pull the plug and then we start with our.

1411
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,620
The other host is Derek H.

1412
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,620
Very cool.

1413
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,620
I don't think Derek H. likes our show though.

1414
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,620
Which makes me a sad panda.

1415
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,620
Don't worry.

1416
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,620
One half does.

1417
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,620
Why doesn't he love me.

1418
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:45,620
I want to know why doesn't Derek H. love me.

1419
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,620
I don't know.

1420
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,620
My fault.

1421
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,620
I love him.

1422
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,620
You pass along that message.

1423
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,620
We here at O.L.R.

1424
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,620
We love Derek and we we we hope that that love is reciprocated.

1425
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:54,620
All right.

1426
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,620
Would you call in to talk to us about tonight.

1427
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,620
Do things.

1428
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,620
Yeah.

1429
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,620
It's about Microsoft and the blue ray thing.

1430
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,620
I think it's dumb.

1431
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,620
Why is it dumb.

1432
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,620
Do you think.

1433
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,620
Do you think it's B.S.

1434
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,620
Or do you think the idea itself is dumb.

1435
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,620
I just think it's dumb in general.

1436
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,620
It's like it was like hey MGS4 is coming.

1437
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,620
It's like we must combat it with a blue ray player.

1438
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:21,620
Just feels like like it just shouldn't be necessary to the Xbox 720.

1439
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:26,620
Yes and no because right now you know why why are a lot of people buying PlayStation

1440
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,620
threes right now.

1441
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:31,620
I kind of said this earlier in the show because it plays Grand Theft Auto 4 and blue rays

1442
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:35,620
Xbox 360 only plays Grand Theft Auto 4 right now it's not really a movie system you know

1443
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,620
yay DVDs but everybody has a freaking DVD player at this point right.

1444
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:44,620
Not a lot of people have that in their systems and people I think the normal average Joe

1445
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,620
I'm not a gamer but I enjoy the occasional violent video game right.

1446
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:54,620
They don't know about all this like download exclusive Xbox 360 stuff.

1447
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,620
They don't know about all that stuff.

1448
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:59,620
They just think it's the same damn game.

1449
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,620
I agree.

1450
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:03,620
So I you know just something to consider.

1451
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:08,620
I just I agree with Loki with he said if they bundle like a new one in I feel like that's

1452
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,620
suicide.

1453
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,620
That'll confuse some people.

1454
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:15,620
You mean actually actually putting a blue ray player as like in the system itself.

1455
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:18,620
Yeah I feel like that's suicide.

1456
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,620
I don't the only time I would see that happening is the holidays.

1457
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:25,620
I don't know why but isn't it ironic because don't they have to pay money to Sony for each

1458
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,620
one of these because you know blue rays like a trademark of Sony.

1459
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,620
You know at this point I think Microsoft will pay it.

1460
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,620
It's just weird.

1461
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,620
It's some odd reason.

1462
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,620
Yeah they already got a patent for this.

1463
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:42,620
They're like hey we gave the blue ray thing and like people start freaking out.

1464
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,620
All right.

1465
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,620
Well what else did you want to call us about anything else on your mind tonight before

1466
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,620
we go on.

1467
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,620
Sure thing about Okami Wii.

1468
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,620
I got that this week.

1469
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,620
And what you think.

1470
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:52,620
I like it.

1471
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,620
It's just the only thing that reminds me of Rainbow Bright.

1472
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,620
OK.

1473
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,620
How does Okami remind you of Rainbow Bright.

1474
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:03,620
Because Rainbow Bright it's all dark and gloomy and you have to fill the world with color.

1475
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,620
And this is what the game does.

1476
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,620
You fill the world with color.

1477
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:09,620
Nice.

1478
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,620
Does that.

1479
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,620
What was it.

1480
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,620
Who is the evil guy in Rainbow Bright.

1481
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,620
I can't remember his name.

1482
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,620
The murky murky murky.

1483
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,620
Yeah I'm sorry I was seeing of the peculiar purple pie man.

1484
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,620
Yeah I keep thinking strawberry shortcake.

1485
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:25,620
Yeah they're so easy to get confused I guess.

1486
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,620
All right.

1487
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,620
Forget it.

1488
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,620
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight.

1489
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,620
Dead Pixel Live right after All Games Interactive.

1490
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,620
Plug plug plug.

1491
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,620
There you go.

1492
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,620
Have a good one buddy.

1493
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,620
Bye.

1494
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,620
Somebody was looking for more podcasts.

1495
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,620
Maybe Dead Pixel Live is up your alley.

1496
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,620
All right.

1497
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,620
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1498
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,620
Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

1499
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,620
SSJ100Matt said wow Raven I never thought about it that way.

1500
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,620
Who knew that Raven's Dolphin could give such insight here on this program.

1501
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,620
Let's see if our next caller does.

1502
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,620
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1503
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,620
Who's this.

1504
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,620
Hi this is Spazinator.

1505
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,620
I'm sorry.

1506
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,620
Your name is what?

1507
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,620
Spazinator.

1508
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,620
Spazinator.

1509
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,620
You need to go buy it on the PlayStation Network.

1510
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,620
Awesome.

1511
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,620
Well what's on your mind Spazinator?

1512
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:10,620
Yeah a couple things.

1513
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:16,620
Much of which you kind of sort of touch on on tonight's show especially in part 1.

1514
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,620
Now I do have one concern about full caliber 4.

1515
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,620
Which is going to be coming out next month.

1516
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,620
Especially with all the characters from Star Wars and what not.

1517
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:34,620
If you think about it you know how at least in all the Star Wars movies supposedly the

1518
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:39,620
light sabers pretty much cut through like 99% of everything out there.

1519
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,620
Right.

1520
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:44,620
Like limbs and walls and stuff like that.

1521
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:52,620
In theory if they want the Star Wars characters in full caliber 4 to be like totally accurate

1522
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,620
and what not wouldn't they be like way overpowered and what not.

1523
01:13:56,620 --> 01:14:02,620
You know like you know cut off people's legs and totally break down the characters weapons

1524
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,620
and what not.

1525
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,620
Well I think you know they're probably just going to balance it.

1526
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,620
Just like you know when things have crossed over before.

1527
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,620
Like you know when Spawn and Link and all those characters showed up before.

1528
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,620
You know they just kind of made it work.

1529
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,620
They just balanced it.

1530
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,620
And that's just what they're going to do here.

1531
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:23,620
And all these kind of crossover games I mean like Capcom versus X-Men.

1532
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:28,620
I mean certainly super heroes would overpower these you know generic fighters right.

1533
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,620
X-Men versus Street Fighter hardcore.

1534
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,620
But they just make it work and they figure people are going to suspend disbelief.

1535
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,620
And I think that's really what it's about is that you're just supposed to say you know

1536
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:39,620
what I'm not going to pay attention to all this fact that the light sabers can like cut

1537
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,620
people into a million pieces.

1538
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,620
I'm just going to you know think how cool it is that I can play you know Soul Calibur

1539
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:49,620
or I can play Darth Vader versus Yoshimitsu and all this stuff you know.

1540
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,620
Oh yeah.

1541
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,620
Yeah I have no doubt that the game is going to be good.

1542
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:59,620
You know I'm kind of both a Soul Calibur fan and Star Wars nuts.

1543
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:04,620
So you know that thought kind of crossed my mind like a week ago.

1544
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,620
So you're okay with this because a lot of people in our chat room earlier were kind

1545
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,620
of like oh why can't they just make Star Wars it's own game.

1546
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,620
Why do they have to have all these Star Wars characters.

1547
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:16,620
You're okay with both kind of living together in the same game.

1548
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,620
Oh yeah.

1549
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:23,620
You know it's just that little you know I hate to use the word but relatively minor

1550
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:27,620
you know concerned with the balancing.

1551
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,620
Tigerclaw made a very similar observation to what you're saying.

1552
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:33,620
He says in chat here that's one of the things I noticed when I saw the gameplay footage

1553
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,620
of Vader and Soul Calibur IV.

1554
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,620
He can literally impale an opponent and throw them.

1555
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,620
Normally a light saber would cut through someone effortlessly.

1556
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,620
Oh yeah.

1557
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,620
So there you have it.

1558
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,620
It's a little wattage.

1559
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,620
Now Spazinator do you think they ought to make a new Star Wars fighting game.

1560
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,620
Like if this does really well do you think Namco needs to be paid like a lot of money

1561
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,620
to like make a new Star Wars fighting game.

1562
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,620
Like we'll just pretend the other one never happened.

1563
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:01,620
Well actually now that you mention it.

1564
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:06,620
I did buy the first one for the PlayStation 1 when it came out.

1565
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:12,620
And I wouldn't necessarily say it was like horrible like E.T. for it's 2600 bad.

1566
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:17,620
But it wasn't exactly game of the year like Final Fantasy 7 great either you know.

1567
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,620
It was kind of like low low low for me.

1568
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:26,620
So but I wouldn't necessarily you know be opposed to a new Star Wars fighting game though.

1569
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:30,620
Hopefully this is Namco putting their feet in the water a little bit and seeing if it's possible.

1570
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,620
I don't know.

1571
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,620
I don't know.

1572
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,620
We can hope.

1573
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,620
Go ahead.

1574
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,620
Oh go ahead.

1575
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,620
Sorry.

1576
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,620
I was just going to say is there anything else you want to talk about before we go Spazinator.

1577
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,620
Yeah.

1578
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:45,620
I know that you kind of got away from Final Fantasy 11 and more into WoW.

1579
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:49,620
But that was notwithstanding.

1580
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:57,620
Have you heard anything about like a fan festival like what they had in Anaheim last year.

1581
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:58,620
I have not.

1582
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:02,620
But from what I understand Squeenix usually announces those things pre last minute.

1583
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,620
I mean not like you know the day before but they only give like two months notice.

1584
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,620
Whereas with Blizzard you know they've already announced hey BlizzCon is going to happen mark the date.

1585
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:14,620
And maybe it's because BlizzCon gets a hell of a lot more people not just because they have WoW.

1586
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:21,620
They also have Starcraft and you know some of those other you know powerhouse games and Diablo 3 rumors are enough to get people to go to.

1587
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,620
I haven't heard anything though even though I left Final Fantasy 11.

1588
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:30,620
I do keep tabs on the news just to see if there's anything like really cool I'm missing out on.

1589
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,620
You know I don't know.

1590
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:35,620
I spent so much time with that freaking game you can't help but just kind of be curious about it.

1591
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,620
It's almost like a bad relationship.

1592
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:42,620
You can't help but wonder whatever happened to your ex.

1593
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,620
You know what I mean.

1594
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:51,620
Yeah honestly I've been playing the PlayStation 2 version of that game for two, two and a half years now and I'm practically addicted to it.

1595
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,620
Even now that I got PlayStation 3.

1596
01:17:54,620 --> 01:18:02,620
And the reason I ask my question is in theory if they hold the Fan Festival this year.

1597
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:09,620
You know this will be the first year I can actually afford to literally go across country and go to the Fan Festival.

1598
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:15,620
And from what I've been told some of my friends are going to be over there and I've been just starting to go to the festival.

1599
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:20,620
If they hold it in California I might actually try to go.

1600
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:25,620
Because it might be a lot of fun especially if it's within driving distance because I think they had one of them in Santa Cruz and that's not that far.

1601
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,620
So I could have gone to that.

1602
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:32,620
But I just didn't know about it until after it already happened because it was when I was you know not really playing.

1603
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:37,620
As a video game journalist to report on the event.

1604
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,620
Well thanks for taking my call.

1605
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,620
You are welcome.

1606
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:46,620
We like hearing from people that we don't get to hear from very often so take care all right.

1607
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:52,620
Oh I just saw something and then I'll let you go.

1608
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:58,620
You know earlier in the show you were asking about that new Commando 3 game.

1609
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:05,620
Yeah that's going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 next week and it's already out for the DS3.

1610
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:13,620
Already got the game and I don't know if there's going to be a difference between the two versions but at least the PlayStation 3 game is pretty good.

1611
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,620
Well that's a good sign.

1612
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:23,620
So if you guys got the 360 or the PS3 I would seriously suggest investing the $10 for the game.

1613
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:29,620
I will definitely check out the demo and see it's worth it because I am tempted by the beta of the new Street Fighter because I do heart Street Fighter.

1614
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:35,620
But yeah I guess that's true it's already out on PS3 so it's good to know that the game is not bad so that you're not like wasting your $10.

1615
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:37,620
But we'll see when that demo comes out.

1616
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,620
All right well have a good one.

1617
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,620
All right thanks spazzinator thanks for your call take care buddy.

1618
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:48,620
All right we'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we're going to call it a night.

1619
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,620
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

1620
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,620
Oh wow it's Legend of Zaku.

1621
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,620
Hey Legend of Zaku.

1622
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,620
No show is complete without a call from Legend of Zaku.

1623
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:01,620
Damn right it's been far too long what is on your mind Zaku?

1624
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:10,620
Nothing much just basically just enjoying all my usual stuff you know games on my 360 like Grand Theft Auto 4 and whatnot.

1625
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,620
That's right you upgraded to a 360 not too long ago huh?

1626
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:17,620
Yeah it's been like about six months.

1627
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,620
What kind of games you been playing?

1628
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,620
Grand Theft Auto obviously.

1629
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:28,620
I kicked the shit out of Call of Duty 4 on veterans so that boosted up my achievement scores.

1630
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:37,620
But besides that I'm just you know just trying to scrap as many games as possible since you know money's kind of tight right now.

1631
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:42,620
But you know it hasn't been so bad.

1632
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:46,620
You know the new unlock code for DDR2 came out right?

1633
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,620
I did hear something about that that there's some new unlocks.

1634
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,620
Tell us about it since we haven't reported on it tonight.

1635
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:59,620
I don't know it's like I spent the better part of Friday and Dave and Buster's trying to do that shit and we weren't able to.

1636
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,620
Huh it has to be hooked up with the emus.

1637
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,620
Are you sure?

1638
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,620
Oh snap so can't.

1639
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:15,620
Are you sure because that one actually was an unlock code in which you actually have to input certain you have to hit certain arrows after you enter your credit.

1640
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,620
I still think it had to be hooked up the emus if I remember correctly.

1641
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,620
Why is that?

1642
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,620
I don't know why. I don't know why they have this kind of.

1643
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,620
Does it download the songs or something?

1644
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:31,620
I think it's because there was some other competition thing that went along with like some Zookan Battle 3 or 2 or something like that I don't know.

1645
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:38,620
But from what I heard other machines besides the one in Illinois which is the only emus in the country managed to get the code.

1646
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,620
Managed to get it working.

1647
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,620
Well then your machine doesn't like you.

1648
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:45,620
Well it just has shitty pads but that's besides the point.

1649
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:56,620
Um yeah just looking through I don't know it's just been a rough you know down week for me I just haven't been playing as much because of other things.

1650
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:05,620
But I do want to get you know hopefully get something from my PSP probably a bigger memory card so I can start like getting more stuff on that thing.

1651
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:14,620
Hey quickly before we go since you still kind of follow the DDR scene and all that and we you know we try I still try to like load DDR Freak and look at the forums once in a while just keep tabs on what's going on.

1652
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:17,620
There have been like tournaments or big things we ought to be looking forward to?

1653
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:21,620
I maybe.

1654
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:26,620
What about digital life? Usually you're calling in digital life, digital life is that happening this year?

1655
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:29,620
It hasn't been confirmed yet that's the thing.

1656
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:38,620
Until I get confirmation I'll let you know but right now I'm not going to jump the gun quickly when I can't really confirm.

1657
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:48,620
You know the fact of the matter is I have to you know I keep tabs on the people that know and they'll let us know exactly when you know if and when it's happening this year.

1658
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:52,620
We'll tell you when we're ready dang it that's what they're saying we'll tell you when we're ready.

1659
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,620
Right.

1660
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:54,620
Alright.

1661
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:58,620
So I'm not that's it I'll let you know once I hear a word of it happening.

1662
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:04,620
Alright sounds good buddy hey we got to wrap up and close the show you got any parting words for our listener tonight?

1663
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,620
Listeners?

1664
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,620
Just hack your PSP.

1665
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,620
Hack your PSP.

1666
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:14,620
Alright buddy have a good one.

1667
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:18,620
That's some great final words hack your PSP it's awesome.

1668
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,620
Alright we're going to do some quick.

1669
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,620
This naked gun thing is great.

1670
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,620
Did you check that out?

1671
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:23,620
It's awesome.

1672
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:26,620
Alright we're going to do some last minute stories we're actually going to start with Jamie tonight.

1673
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:43,620
I just think that you know in He Who Shall Not Be Named more news about him is that he's been well it's not that it's official yet but it's been recommended for a ten year disbarment for his 27 misconduct charges.

1674
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:53,620
Also it should be noted that two of his Supreme Court cases were actually dismissed with prejudice meaning he can't file it again.

1675
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:59,620
So I'm hoping the judge says yes and goes for the ten years.

1676
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:02,620
Again this is about He Who Shall Not Be Named.

1677
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,620
Well he was very.

1678
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,620
Oh yeah they wouldn't let him read his.

1679
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:13,620
Ten years like long argument or whatever which pretty much called everyone a dumb ass and stuff like that.

1680
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,620
Real class.

1681
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:21,620
Yeah he won the judge didn't allow him to read and he had prepared in advance of course was like whatever dude.

1682
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:24,620
So yeah.

1683
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:26,620
He's I think I think it's going to go through.

1684
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,620
Prepared my speech and why I'm awesome.

1685
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,620
You want to read it.

1686
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:32,620
Anyway.

1687
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,620
All right.

1688
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:35,620
You got something for us.

1689
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,620
Yeah Loki what do you got.

1690
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:43,620
Some stuff about Halo Wars coming from GamePro.

1691
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:56,620
Apparently the latest issue had the exclusive and some magazine scans have already found their way onto the Internet and new things that we found out from it.

1692
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,620
Basically the detail the current control scheme.

1693
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:11,620
There is going to be some new UNC or UNSC vehicles including the vultures Cyclops and Cobras as well as mentions of like a campaign will be a combination of human and covenant worlds.

1694
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:15,620
Also let's see here.

1695
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:22,620
It's going to boast a six player Xbox Live multiplayer and feature two person online co-op.

1696
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:27,620
And that's all in GamePro's July issue which should be out soon.

1697
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:33,620
Also we were talking about movies earlier with Leonardo DiCaprio being in the Atari movie.

1698
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:51,620
Well now there's another movie being made Kane and Lynch with Bruce Willis going to be starring in it as Kane Marcus or Adam Kane Marcus I guess which is weird because Billy Bob Thornton apparently is in talks for the role of Lynch.

1699
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:55,620
So it's like that's going to be a classy movie.

1700
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,620
I don't know we'll see.

1701
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:06,620
Sony has apparently stopped production of a couple of games that they were showing off hell I think before the PS3 even came out including Eight Days and The Getaway.

1702
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:12,620
Eight Days I believe was that one that they showed the demo for including all the bullets ripping up a car and that kind of stuff.

1703
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:15,620
Oh well not coming out I guess.

1704
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:26,620
The Bioshock movie which we talked about I believe last week has been confirmed of course as part of the conference call following Take Two's second quarter earnings.

1705
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:44,620
They addressed the questions from different analysts about different topics and they also said that the Bioshock movie will be coming and that it's unlikely that the movie will be released alongside Bioshock 2 but it will probably make it for Bioshock 3.

1706
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:50,620
So spoiler Bioshock 2 will be getting a sequel.

1707
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:52,620
I don't know.

1708
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:56,620
And then finally I forgot to talk about this earlier.

1709
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,620
Rock Band the download content for this coming week.

1710
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:03,620
They've got the MTV 2 pack which is going to feature.

1711
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,620
Crap.

1712
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,620
Yeah.

1713
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,620
Moving to Seattle by the material.

1714
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,620
I've never heard of them.

1715
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,620
A Clean Shot by the Myriad.

1716
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:15,620
Bullets and Guns by Them Terribles.

1717
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:21,620
Those are each available for 80 Microsoft points or 240 points for the entire pack.

1718
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:28,620
And finally an individual song Girls Who Play Guitars by Maximo Park.

1719
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,620
For also 80 points.

1720
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:31,620
All right.

1721
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,620
Is that it for last minute stories.

1722
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,620
That is it.

1723
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,620
All right.

1724
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,620
Well then that's going to wind down.

1725
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,620
Oh and to answer a question you had.

1726
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:38,620
Hey wait a minute you said OK.

1727
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,620
Sorry this is answering questions it's not a story.

1728
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,620
All right.

1729
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:45,620
One block equals 128 kilobytes.

1730
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,620
So if you do the math there.

1731
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:49,620
I believe it's five.

1732
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:50,620
Five hundred blocks.

1733
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,620
I don't know.

1734
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,620
All right.

1735
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:57,620
Anyhow we're in wrap up the show now it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Laundry.

1736
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,620
Oh but not before we get everybody's final thought.

1737
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:09,620
I will start tonight with my final thought and my final thought is that these Haribo Happy Cola gummy candies that are like the little bottles of cola.

1738
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:10,620
Are like the yummiest things in the world.

1739
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,620
I love these things.

1740
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,620
And they're not fat which is awesome.

1741
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,620
Dark soccer your final thought.

1742
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,620
I want food.

1743
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,620
Real food.

1744
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,620
The kind you can eat and digest.

1745
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,620
Loki your final thought.

1746
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,620
My final thought is.

1747
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,620
God damn it.

1748
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:41,620
I got to get a hundred percent on Grand Theft Auto IV. Like one. I have to basically unlock the special ability of Packy.

1749
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:44,620
Basically when you get your friendship up a certain percentage.

1750
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:49,620
He'll allow you to call him to give you cars with bombs in them.

1751
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:55,620
And that will kick me over to a hundred percent and I get the achievement and I'm done with the story.

1752
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:59,620
Cars with bombs awesome.

1753
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:00,620
All right.

1754
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,620
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry.

1755
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:05,620

1758
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:16,620
So we really appreciate you guys supporting us and keeping us the OLR family for almost six years now.

1759
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,620
Very very close to that.

1760
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:23,620
Thank you as always if you like what you've heard all you have to do help us spread the word about Orange Laundry.

1761

Independent podcasting in general because you know as independent podcasting grows we all win.

1762
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:33,620
All you have to do tell two friends about the show and they'll check it out and then hopefully tell two more friends and so on and so on.

1763
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:37,620
Until we spread all over the world including Kenya right.

1764
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,620
He is from Kenya.

1765
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,620
All right.

1766
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,620
I'm chatting with him.

1767
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:41,620
All right.

1768
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,620
All right.

1769
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:45,620
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1770
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:46,620
Thank you guys so much.

1771
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:51,620
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio for more debauchery.

1772
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,620
And hopefully more reminiscing about better times.

1773
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,620
Yes.

1774
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,620
Absolutely.

1775
01:29:55,620 --> 01:30:24,620
We'll see you then.

1776
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:34,620
See you next week.
