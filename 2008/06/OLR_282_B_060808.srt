00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:05,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:14,723
[SPEAKER_01]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:19,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,302
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

5
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,761
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.

6
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes he runs long, sometimes he runs short, just depends.

7
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually he can catch us around 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

8
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:55,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, if you get here at like 4.45, there's a great block of programming on allgames.com.

9
00:00:55,644 --> 00:01:02,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts off with Kropotkin's UK Gaming News, moves on into the Bobby Blackwolf show, and ends with us, your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:11,370
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to get into the gaming news here for Part B. I just wanted to say real quick, though, we got some guests coming up later this month.

11
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to arrange some interviews.

12
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything sealed yet, so I'll get back to you guys on that.

13
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:23,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But in studio, one of our longtime OLR friends who hasn't been here in a long time is going to be back in two weeks.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Miklatov will be here visiting in two weeks.

15
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:27,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So he'll be back on the program.

16
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:29,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to play high school musical stuff for him and get in the game.

17
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:29,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

18
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:32,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he can tell us what happened to Silent Hill Arcade.

19
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,806
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted to go to the whole happening thing that we were going to do.

20
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:38,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I may postpone it a week so we can include him as well.

21
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,127
[SPEAKER_04]: As well.

22
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:40,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.

23
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:45,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the happening, I think it's going to suck, but it'll be like a Lady in the Water.

24
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We can either go all enjoy it or all make fun of it.

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since the chatters have no idea what you're talking about, you're trying to organize people to go see M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, right?

26
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

27
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see it.

28
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:57,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen Lady in the Water.

29
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, consider yourself lucky then.

30
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,693
[SPEAKER_00]: But I liked The Village a lot.

31
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked The Village too, and I thought people were really hard on that movie.

32
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:08,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked The Sixth Sense.

33
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved The Sixth Sense.

34
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I even liked Unbreakable, but seriously, Lady in the Water was shit.

35
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:20,571
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem with The Village, though, is they show you what the twist is, and then they're like, oh, pretend you didn't see that.

36
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,472
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do the twist again.

37
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:23,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just kidding.

38
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually what it was before.

39
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:26,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my problem with it.

40
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:28,155
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so he'll be back.

41
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:32,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he can tell us anything about the latest and greatest at his video game employer.

42
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:33,758
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be fun.

44
00:02:56,496 --> 00:03:00,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he doesn't really go ride roller coasters, but I told him he has to ride everything I want him to.

45
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'll scream like a girl.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get YouTube to... Roller coasters are... I won't say great because I've only ever really been on one.

47
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:09,965
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one I've been on is great.

48
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,933
[SPEAKER_03]: California Screamin' California Screamin'

49
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:42,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

50
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:45,314
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a 3D ride.

51
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:46,735
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not a 3D ride.

52
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:47,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a video game.

53
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It would cost you like three bucks to play.

54
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget what it's called.

55
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:54,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Wikipedia.

56
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been since the last time I've been.

57
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,119
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been.

58
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Kadosho says Goose and Maverick?

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.

60
00:03:58,561 --> 00:03:59,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's a reference to Top Gun.

61
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,642
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell am I thinking?

62
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice one.

63
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:03,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something three.

64
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:04,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it's called.

65
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:05,264
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways.

66
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,204
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get back into some gaming news.

67
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:08,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough about our personal lives.

68
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:09,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk gaming.

69
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:10,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

70
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:13,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

71
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, it says apparently the integration with the MMO is going to affect, um, the stuff that happens on air.

72
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:48,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, they gave, um, we can tell players that there'll be an alien invasion at a certain place in the game at a certain time and to be there, um,

73
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:53,014
[SPEAKER_04]: All their friends and stuff would be ready at that time.

74
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:58,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It says the outcome depends on them and then the battle will be part of the universe in the show.

75
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they fail and they all die, then that will be reflected on the TV show, which I think is pretty cool.

76
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: It says both the show and the series will be set 80 to 100 years in the future and launched sometime sooner than summer of 2010.

77
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:25,649
[SPEAKER_03]: When I read this or hear about it, I can't help but think, how awesome would the Battlestar Galactica game have been if it was this?

78
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

79
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that Battlestar Galactica thing they put on Xbox is, like, junk.

80
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,231
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a great game somewhere in the Battlestar Galactica universe.

81
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:39,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And something like this is like an MMO where, you know, what happens in the show happens... That would be awesome!

82
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:48,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to fuel the fanboy flames or anything, but wouldn't this be funny, just throwing it out there, if it was, like, say...

83
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:59,113
[SPEAKER_04]: A relaunch of like Firefly or something like that, you know, and they have this whole universe that takes place at the same time and that kind of thing.

84
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:00,374
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be funny.

85
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:07,535
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of cool, but sadly I think the cast is all doing other stuff now, so I guess it could be like a new generation, but I don't know.

86
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't seem like something that Josh Whedon would be all over, but you never know, I guess.

87
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt it.

88
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be probably something original.

89
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely.

90
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:16,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely.

91
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:24,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something else original and actually spotted in the wild this week, Duke Nukem Forever.

92
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:25,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it exists.

93
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:31,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out there, and you can actually see a little peek of it in this very strange place.

94
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:41,592
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think if Duke Nukem Forever is going to launch its first footage ever, it's going to be like a one-up exclusive or a game trailer's hot spot.

95
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: The Office sort of shot the way The Office is

96
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:00,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

97
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:07,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But they kind of joke about Duke Nukem Forever, and it actually is Duke Nukem Forever that you see in the little show.

98
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's around the 4 minute and 15 second mark, and the most surprising thing about it, it actually looks kind of cool for that 30 seconds.

99
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell of a way to hype something up, you know?

100
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:22,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I...

101
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

102
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:57,337
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're actually... What the focus of the show is supposed to be is on the people developing the games and not necessarily the games themselves and celebrities who play games and stuff like that.

103
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's their kind of spin on things.

104
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It's less about the games but more about the developers and people behind the stuff.

105
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:09,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it one of those things... I didn't watch it, I'll be honest, because I didn't care about Duke Nukem Forever footage because nothing will match the original to me.

106
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:12,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But was it one of those things where, like...

107
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:21,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's kind of like self-parody, where you really kind of have to be in the know to understand the jokes, or was it really accessible to any people?

108
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:21,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

109
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:22,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even really parody.

110
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just an interview show.

111
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: They just shot it in the same way as you would shoot, like, The Office or something like that.

112
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:42,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, lots of cuts, you know, lots of just, you know, cutting between perspectives and stuff like that, and just talking to people, and there was, you know, some goofy moments, but it was no different than, like, say, like, okay, I don't want to, you know...

113
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:42,992
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

114
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,212
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

115
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:29,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

116
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:30,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

117
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega was grossly overlooked by a lot of people at the time it came out.

118
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:43,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people, if they realized... If you knew then what you know now about the Dreamcast, I bet you it would have done a lot better.

119
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:49,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's okay that we highlight a lot of those games because a lot of people didn't give them a first look the first time around.

120
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:51,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

121
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:52,132
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

122
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week is another Dreamcast game.

123
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.

124
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:54,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

125
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like Power Stone or something.

126
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreamcast games until we get to half.

127
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Power Stone was awesome, wasn't it?

128
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:03,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Power Stone was kind of awesome.

129
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I would approve of that, actually.

130
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,773
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use your save files from the Japanese version on the US version.

131
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well keep it a surprise until next week.

132
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:11,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I might do that, I don't know.

133
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, more gaming news, yes?

134
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Duty 4!

135
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:17,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't that sound awesome?

136
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:30,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they're getting a variety pack for free for the PC version that's actually going to be offered as part of a deal with NVIDIA.

137
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:35,379
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coming two months after, of course, everyone got it on Xbox 360.

138
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,921
[SPEAKER_00]: However, like I said, they don't have to pay for it.

139
00:10:40,191 --> 00:11:08,373
[SPEAKER_00]: um it's uh Creek in Chinatown are the um highlights there are um uh new arenas they're supposed to be um Kill House and Broadcast um and uh another one is a patch 1.6 that uh fixes a server crash exploit and a bunch of bugs so there you go hooray bug fixes yay bug report

140
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:15,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of fixes and tweaks, there's going to be some new tweaks in line for Team Fortress 2.

141
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,282
[SPEAKER_04]: The next class to be upgraded, I guess, would be the Pyro class.

142
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:28,045
[SPEAKER_04]: They are giving them a brand new, I believe, an axe, which is going to be kind of neat.

143
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:34,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there are rumors that they're going to be introducing a sniper class as well.

144
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:35,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

145
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:37,684
[SPEAKER_04]: That's neat.

146
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:43,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to see games that they kind of tweak them as things come out to improve them and make them a little bit better.

147
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I have not jumped on the bandwagon.

148
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really played Team Fortress 2.

149
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:54,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mainly because I like a little single player in my multiplayer games.

150
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,590
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just me.

151
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, the new weapon, as I was saying, is called the Extinguisher.

152
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:04,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

153
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:06,675
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

154
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Meet the Sniper?

155
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking of that movie.

156
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Meet the Parents.

157
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:34,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Meet the Sniper.

158
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,239
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it.

159
00:12:39,959 --> 00:13:05,383
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe the sniper's already in the game maybe I'm just an idiot because like I said I don't play this game but um they are giving the sniper like an intro they they're doing like they did little intro videos for all the different classes that are in this game so they have um you know little funny videos that kind of explain what the you know class involves and that kind of thing you're not supposed to meet the sniper they're just supposed to shoot you in the face when you're not looking well yes you can actually be shot in the face and live

160
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:12,168
[SPEAKER_00]: A good sniper would aim for the neck or the forehead.

161
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:23,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently a druid knew where to aim to kill Onyxia all by his little self.

162
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:28,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it might have been a female druid that did this.

163
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:30,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

164
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a female druid, Sirenia, that did this.

165
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it really a female druid or was it a guy playing a female druid?

166
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a guy playing a female druid just like I am.

167
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the deal.

168
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Onyxia, if you're not in the WoW, no.

169
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Onyxia used to be the boss of one of those 40-man raids.

170
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,119
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she

171
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:45,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

172
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:09,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

173
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:31,630
[SPEAKER_03]: which is kind of a feat to kill what was once a 40-man boss all by your little self.

174
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

175
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got to say, you guys have been listening to this show long enough.

176
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:45,555
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that I'm getting more and more into WoW, and I've been experiencing the endgame content in it, which is kind of new for me because when I played Final Fantasy XI for all those years, I never got to endgame.

177
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:49,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all a mystery for me, but now I'm actually running the 10s and the 25s.

178
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,516
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been in Serpent Shrine Cavern.

179
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,717
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been in Tempest Keep.

180
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, I haven't gotten to Sunwell yet, but you know,

181
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm making a lot more progression in this game than I ever did with any other MMO.

182
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:00,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been very interesting.

183
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:03,506
[SPEAKER_03]: The social dynamics of it is just... These games are something else.

184
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:04,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else.

185
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to guest on a WoW show, by the way.

186
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:13,054
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know of a Warcraft podcast that needs the Rob Roberts perspective, I'd love to go visit someday.

187
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:15,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Because WoW is fun to talk about.

188
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:19,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to beat you over the head with it here on this show.

189
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:32,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in more World of Warcraft news, there is a 27-year-old gamer who is now in deep caca.

190
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:42,169
[SPEAKER_00]: He met this girl playing World of Warcraft, fell in internet love, and they ran away together.

191
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Less than three forever.

192
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever.

193
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the girl is 14.

194
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:47,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Dope.

195
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Oopsie.

196
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,098
[SPEAKER_04]: She said she was 18 online.

197
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:58,061
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually found in Franklin County, Washington in a campground.

198
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:02,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, in a campground?

199
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a KOA?

200
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?

201
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,768
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy and the girl ran off together to a KOA?

202
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:09,548
[SPEAKER_00]: They went camping.

203
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:11,590
[SPEAKER_00]: They were camping.

204
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting for that spawn.

205
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:13,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

206
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,266
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really good.

207
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:15,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah, wah.

208
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:17,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo.

209
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:23,012
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, that's just really sad.

210
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:30,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but what really way is there to control if someone lies or not on the game, right?

211
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think that they were lying.

212
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she was just touched in the head and, you know, decided, hey, I'm going to go meet this guy.

213
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,407
[SPEAKER_04]: He seems really nice.

214
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But, Mom, I'm in love.

215
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:47,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Love does cause certain chemical reactions that have mimicked insanity.

216
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:48,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not joking.

217
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

218
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:52,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see why he did that.

219
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:52,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the follow-up?

220
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he in jail now or what happened?

221
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they do it?

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

223
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

224
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:02,861
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually doesn't say.

225
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,181
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says he's in legal trouble.

226
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

227
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:05,802
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in legal trouble.

228
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,282
[SPEAKER_03]: He must have crossed the line.

229
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,831
[SPEAKER_03]: There's likely... Which really running away together is kind of just cross the line.

230
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,012
[SPEAKER_03]: None of that physical stuff really even needs to be involved.

231
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:19,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't say what exactly, but... It'll be some good old prison time coming his way, it says.

232
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,216
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's, I think, out on parole right now.

233
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

234
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So... The question is, will she wait for him?

235
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And M64 in chat changed his nickname to Chris Hansen and said, Hi there.

236
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you have a seat right there?

237
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, now that's a dateline I'd like to see.

238
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Catching the WoW Predators

239
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:03,104
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't put a microwave next to your computer because it will interfere with your speakers.

240
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:05,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to put it a few feet away.

241
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:07,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf has an obvious point I didn't even think about.

242
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,569
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he crossed state lines with a miner.

243
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:10,109
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kidnapping.

244
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:10,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

245
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why he's in trouble.

246
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,773
[SPEAKER_04]: He should have done his research first, dumbass.

247
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:20,256
[SPEAKER_03]: There's campgrounds all over the place.

248
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:21,277
[SPEAKER_03]: There's KOAs everywhere.

249
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:24,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, what level did she say she was?

250
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:25,780
[SPEAKER_00]: F.U.

251
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,200
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Week

252
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,631
[SPEAKER_00]: My FU of the week.

253
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:18,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really, I guess it's more, I guess, self-directed because I'm really nervous about something that's going to be going on tomorrow.

254
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:20,817
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want it to go well.

255
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:27,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to do my nervous habit of talking, like, wildly while this is going on out of nerves.

256
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So, FU to nerves.

257
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Just out of concern for the listeners, though, it's not medical.

258
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:37,287
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in, like, any type of... I'm going in for a job interview, okay?

259
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:40,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just want to clarify, people don't need to be worried about your health or anything.

260
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,011
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine there.

261
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:47,057
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have any type of degenerative diseases other than the walking pneumonia and the bogey-bogey flu.

262
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:48,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

263
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:50,066
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have to tell.

264
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:50,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

265
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure listeners didn't get worried.

266
00:19:52,568 --> 00:20:01,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I guess F you to stupid workers at Roundtable for taking 40 minutes to make two-minute breadsticks.

267
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:03,576
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

268
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to work there, so I know how long it takes.

269
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:07,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not take 40 minutes.

270
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And God, hire some more intelligent people for your front counters.

271
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated that shit.

272
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,275
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to my tooth.

273
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:20,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been having all this pain in my mouth, one of my teeth.

274
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's probably got to have a root canal or something.

275
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:24,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be a bad situation.

276
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been hurting a lot.

277
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever had a tooth hurt this bad.

278
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like constantly having to take Tylenol or Advil or something.

279
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means I'm actually going to have to go to the dentist on Monday.

280
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's the thing, you guys.

281
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the dentist.

282
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people have those fears of the dentist.

283
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:39,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that I'm necessarily afraid of the dentist.

284
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:43,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hate the dentist because dentists are like used car salesmen.

285
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,652
[SPEAKER_03]: They try to sell you stuff you don't need.

286
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:45,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God.

287
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:46,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my dentist.

288
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:47,553
[SPEAKER_03]: My last dentist.

289
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a true story about an experience I had with a dentist.

290
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:50,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just HMO versus PPO.

291
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:51,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I have PPO, it'll be better.

292
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:56,939
[SPEAKER_03]: But the last dentist I had tried to tell me I needed a replacement crown that was $1,200.

293
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, I did need the replacement crown, but what they neglected to tell me was that my plan would also cover a crown that was only $300.

294
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were purposely trying to rip me off.

295
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:11,586
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how, like, how much that turns me off to dentists in general?

296
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:13,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it makes me feel like I'm going to go buy a used car.

297
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree that, like, dental health is important, and I'm a fucking moron for not going to the dentist more often, but if that's the kind of treatment I'm going to get, do you understand why I don't like going?

298
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:23,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, I totally understand.

299
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:25,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it.

300
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you later.

301
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:31,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you earlier that I recommend my dentist to you.

302
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:31,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

303
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:38,899
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never... And I haven't been to the dentist except for this one since I was in the third grade because we didn't have insurance for that.

304
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:39,560
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't afford it.

305
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:39,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

306
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up Poe, okay?

307
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:43,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Poe.

308
00:21:44,163 --> 00:21:44,343
[SPEAKER_00]: But...

309
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:51,424
[SPEAKER_00]: The dentist that I go to, they give you cookies when you leave.

310
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're good cookies.

311
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:53,986
[SPEAKER_03]: How cute.

312
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chairs, I fall asleep in their chairs.

313
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:58,330
[SPEAKER_00]: They're memory foam.

314
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of them are professional soothing.

315
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:04,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to sell you shit you don't need.

316
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,137
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put it out there and let you review it if you want it.

317
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need.

318
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need.

319
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:14,783
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got all of my fillings done, they said, you have, here's a composite, here's this one, here's this one, here's this one.

320
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:19,505
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the pros and cons of this one are, this is the pros and cons of this one, this is the pros and cons of this one.

321
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:19,986
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.

322
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:27,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, if this, now see, I did end up, before Jamie knew I had problems, I just scheduled with somebody else, a co-worker recommended him, and he's like right around the corner, so, you know.

323
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to check it out and hope it's a little better because what I like about this is just one guy, his assistant, and the front desk lady.

324
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:38,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a big company, and those big companies tend to screw you more.

325
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, also, this one's not a big one, and also if you go to my dentist, I get a $50 gift certificate for all of them.

326
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,128
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

327
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:51,353
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do, because they're a small business, they offer perks to their clients.

328
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt in chat says, Rob, my dad wouldn't do that to you.

329
00:22:56,437 --> 00:22:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's awesome that we know somebody whose dad's a dentist.

330
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go to a family or friend dentist in a heartbeat.

331
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know any.

332
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, SSJ100Matt's in New York City, and I can't exactly fly to New York to have my dental work done.

333
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:09,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not very cost-effective.

334
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

335
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

336
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it doesn't really matter.

337
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:22,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're not that rich yet to where we can fly out to New York to get your dental work done.

338
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe someday.

339
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:28,341
[SPEAKER_03]: When we are, you know, rich internet celebrities, I will totally fly out to New York just to see SSJ100Mad's dad.

340
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:29,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

341
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,923
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I know I can, like, trust him, because Matt will put in a good word for me.

342
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:35,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not sure if this guy's a rich internet celebrity.

343
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:38,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's probably a celebrity, at least in the gaming world.

344
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:42,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nolan Bushnell, he has a biopic that's being made about him.

345
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:48,321
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, must we forget that he also, you know, founded Chuck E. Cheese.

346
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, they're making a biopic about Nolan Bushnell?

347
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:50,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

348
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,789
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the story there?

349
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:56,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the fact that he invented all these things.

350
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:59,432
[SPEAKER_04]: The story is Chuck E. Cheese is fucking awesome.

351
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was fucking awesome.

352
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand corrected.

353
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:03,997
[SPEAKER_00]: The pizza sucks ass.

354
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:05,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

355
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:06,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They had cool arcades at one time.

356
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,421
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 80s.

357
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:11,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I say one time because all those arcades have been replaced with neon lights and ticket redemption machines.

358
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:12,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They had that Ferrari game.

359
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:13,207
[SPEAKER_00]: That Ferrari game's cool.

360
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so apparently... Dude, I should have my 30th birthday at Chuck E. Cheese.

361
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,476
[SPEAKER_03]: How awesome would that be?

362
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:30,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Paramount Pictures has picked up the movie and Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be attached to star in the movie as Nolan Bushnell.

363
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird in a way.

364
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,531
[SPEAKER_00]: How does he look like?

365
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Makeup, I don't know.

366
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:40,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, BlackWolf says, Sky, they won't let you.

367
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't let me.

368
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:42,771
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

369
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:43,652
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't let me.

370
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,433
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a paying customer.

371
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't let me have my birthday party?

372
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:49,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some friends try.

373
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,458
[SPEAKER_03]: They got kicked out because they have no kids.

374
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:54,580
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that, it's not racist, but it's ageist.

375
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Rob, Rob, Rob.

376
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:56,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I'm gay.

377
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:56,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

378
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:57,302
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

379
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

380
00:24:59,264 --> 00:24:59,484
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

381
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:02,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we invite people we know who have children?

382
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell them you're having your birthday party.

383
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandalists in chat says, Incredible Pizza Factory is more fun anyway.

384
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:38,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's talking about John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

385
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:42,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing with John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

386
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:47,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree that it's a pretty rad place and that the food is a slight step better.

387
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:48,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Only slight.

388
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

389
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:52,025
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no animatronic animals.

390
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:53,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, it fails.

391
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:55,848
[SPEAKER_00]: We could put Loki in a teagle costume.

392
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,232
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be a little better.

393
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an animatronic animal.

394
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:03,319
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's my birthday!

395
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit.

396
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Ranma makes the best suggestion ever.

397
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:08,006
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

398
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:09,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave and Busters.

399
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Too far.

400
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:12,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Too far.

401
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:13,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go every year.

402
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:14,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.

403
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:15,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Disneyland last year.

404
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to Disneyland for my birthday.

405
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, Rob.

406
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:18,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Disneyland.

407
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:18,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait.

408
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Black will finish this story here.

409
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:23,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this has nothing to do with games, but I don't care.

410
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Adults wanting to go to Chuck E. Cheese is a very important topic.

411
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my friends were just trying to go there for lunch one day.

412
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:30,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Company outing.

413
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:35,979
[SPEAKER_03]: They were stopped at the door and told that they weren't welcome because they might have overrun the place for the kids.

414
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we went there in college once and they didn't say anything.

415
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:38,660
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

416
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,220
[SPEAKER_03]: We went there on a weeknight once in college.

417
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,861
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't say anything.

418
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We've walked in the... Don't ask me why.

419
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:50,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when QZAR was open, someone actually ordered pizza from Chuck E. Cheese because they had takeout also.

420
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:51,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

421
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:53,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

422
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wakes up, mm-mm, I'm craving Chuck E. Cheese crapola pizza.

423
00:26:56,986 --> 00:27:01,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was, mm-mm, I'm Poe.

424
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say this.

425
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:04,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way...

426
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:13,812
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in high school, after I graduated, we decided to all go to Chuck E. Cheese's and I got humped by the person playing Chuck E. Cheese.

427
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,255
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was also my boyfriend at the time.

428
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:17,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, okay.

429
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:18,257
Ha!

430
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:19,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You were in the furries!

431
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:20,500
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

432
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you had sex with Chuck E. Cheese.

433
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:23,983
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

434
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:24,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Furry lover!

435
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,227
[SPEAKER_00]: It was silly.

436
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:28,869
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um...

437
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:42,133
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we went in there and, you know, I had a bunch of my friends there and, you know, we ate shitty pizza and played skee-ball until we puked and it was fun and no one ever did shit about it.

438
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,254
[SPEAKER_04]: CC's Pizza is an East Coast chain anyways.

439
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:45,494
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a CC's.

440
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Black Wolf is referencing CC's Pizza.

441
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of it.

442
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:56,822
[SPEAKER_04]: They have this thing that's on TV, they're talking about a buffet and stuff, and it's like five bucks, and the pizza looks like it's worth every penny.

443
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $5 cardboard shit pizza.

444
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,208
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Morpheus says, there are times that Loki sounds like an animatronic animal.

445
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:11,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have to say, Patty said in our chat room that she got kicked out of there when she was 18 and had a kid with her.

446
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:16,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I have a better suggestion for you.

447
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite Chuck E. Cheese.

448
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:18,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite...

449
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Scandia.

450
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:24,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Scandia in Sacramento, but the Scandia more towards Vallejo.

451
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:26,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you need to go.

452
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:28,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's no water park.

453
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no Super Ghetto Kids running around.

454
00:28:30,327 --> 00:28:33,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just arcade, go-karts, and golf.

455
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:34,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Like God intended it.

456
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:43,236
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have tons of SNK machines and the Taito games.

457
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:43,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never set foot in there.

458
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I drive by it every time I go to the bay.

459
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:46,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, they're great.

460
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:46,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

461
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what they actually advertise on the sign, Loki?

462
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:52,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade golf and go-karts the way God intended it.

463
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,148
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way it should be.

464
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:56,549
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

465
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So what, Leonardo DiCaprio, what?

466
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,534
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to play against Nolan Bushnell.

467
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:02,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the movie is actually entitled Atari.

468
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

469
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,059
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

470
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:08,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Foodio?

471
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,984
[SPEAKER_03]: No, now it's like Orange Lounge Chuck E. Cheese-io.

472
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:14,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's go to... We were talking about games, okay?

473
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:16,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Nolan Bushnell created Chuck E. Cheese.

474
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about Chuck E. Cheese.

475
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:18,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still relevant.

476
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:22,608
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a topic that always comes up on our show, actually, is whatever happened to Awesome Arcades?

477
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

478
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:24,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

479
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:24,848
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a myth.

480
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:25,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

481
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:26,789
[SPEAKER_00]: They've fallen into obscurity.

482
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:32,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's sad that our kids are only going to have to hear stories about the arcades.

483
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:36,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to make it sound like what our parents told us about the sock hop.

484
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:36,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo-hoo!

485
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ever hear about the sock hop.

486
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:40,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

487
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:43,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, no more tangents.

488
00:29:44,787 --> 00:29:45,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?

489
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:45,988
[SPEAKER_03]: One more?

490
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:47,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You good for one more, Jamie?

491
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:49,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, Tangent Lounge Radio.

492
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:52,132
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the ferret's tangent.

493
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:53,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue!

494
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:54,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You're withholding, I know it.

495
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:55,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

496
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:57,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, EverQuest.

497
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:57,916
[SPEAKER_00]: These are good cashews.

498
00:29:58,016 --> 00:29:59,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge EverQuestio.

499
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the deal with EverQuest.

500
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:06,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony Online Entertainment, also known as SOE, or as I call it, SOE,

501
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So has reactivated all of the gone players.

502
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:22,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if you abandoned EverQuest some time ago, So has reactivated your account for two free months for both EverQuest and EverQuest 2.

503
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,025
[SPEAKER_03]: That is everybody.

504
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:26,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you left the game, it's time to come back.

505
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:27,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

506
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:32,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So also included all of EverQuest's expansions in those accounts.

507
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:38,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get bonuses to help your players that are out of date get them up to speed.

508
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:40,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of interesting there.

509
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:43,879
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Living Legacy campaign.

510
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's basically a way to try to sucker people back into Evercrack.

511
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:48,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's two months for free.

512
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take a break from World of Warcraft and go grief some people.

513
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:51,784
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

514
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:52,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

515
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,091
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

516
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,734
[SPEAKER_03]: EverQuest is one of those games I never really got into because I got into Final Fantasy XI instead.

517
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Like about the time I would have gotten into EverQuest, somebody showed me Japanese Final Fantasy XI and I was like, ooh, I'm waiting for this.

518
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Final Fantasy and it's online.

519
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:07,983
[SPEAKER_03]: What more do you want?

520
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I worry about.

521
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:14,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy is going to do something like this in the future and I'm going to be like, kind of want... Final Fantasy XIV.

522
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of want... Actually, it'll be just Final Fantasy Online or something.

523
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

524
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:19,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

525
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:20,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff.

526
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:21,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

527
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:22,683
[SPEAKER_00]: And nonsense.

528
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:24,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this nonsense.

529
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:25,245
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm kidding.

530
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:26,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I read a comment from chat real quick?

531
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:29,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say it because it's about the arcade thing we were talking about.

532
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:34,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Siren in chat says, I only hear stories about awesome arcades and it makes me cry that there are no more.

533
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:46,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we have to realize there actually are, you know, I don't want to say younger kids, but, you know, teenagers that are now teenagers that were like, you know, too young to remember when we were teenagers that are already going through this.

534
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:47,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of sucks.

535
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

536
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

537
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,515
[SPEAKER_03]: They will never know how awesome it was to stand on a booster seat to play Crystal Castles

538
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like even when I was in high school, and I'm sorry for going off on another little thing.

539
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:58,022
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do here.

540
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:04,844
[SPEAKER_00]: But my little brother Matthew got hit by a car when he was six, and I was still a freshman in high school.

541
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:16,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember being dropped off at the mall to go see a movie with my friend Jennifer, and we went and hung out in the arcade for hours.

542
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:17,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

543
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to have tilts in the malls and stuff like that.

544
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is now a hot topic.

545
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Tilt got purchased by Namco.

546
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,618
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that because I worked for Namco Arcade when all this was going on.

547
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,866
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had Aladdin's Castle and we actually got a cyber station later.

548
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:38,412
[SPEAKER_00]: The Aladdin's Castle got turned into a cyber station and they opened an Aladdin's Castle in the mall across the street.

549
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:39,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at them both.

550
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:45,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that was actually right around the time that Arcade started sucking was when I quit working in one.

551
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:49,309
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I was there all day.

552
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing Samurai Shodown 2.

553
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:54,553
[SPEAKER_00]: We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that day.

554
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:55,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

555
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:59,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that right when we beat the game, they freaking turned off the machine.

556
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:00,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuckers.

557
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:03,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, and these guys paid for me to play.

558
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:05,241
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome because they wanted to do a four-person game.

559
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,302
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, here, we have money.

560
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:06,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

561
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:07,863
[SPEAKER_03]: They paid you to do a four-way?

562
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:08,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, baby.

563
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Leonardo, so that's kind of cheating.

564
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,665
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway.

565
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:15,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't believe I still remember.

566
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:19,049
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because my brother was injured that that really stuck out in my mind.

567
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,750
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we play air hockey.

568
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcades, like only a few have air hockey anymore.

569
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:27,271
[SPEAKER_03]: That is sad.

570
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:28,432
[SPEAKER_03]: That is fucking criminal.

571
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:32,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what arcade is perfect if you're not dodging air hockey pellets?

572
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:41,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of perfect arcade, and I apologize for a moment to our international audience because this is a very local reference, but DJ Morpheus brought this up, and I have to know if Jamie's ever been here.

573
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:44,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever go to Sam's Town in Cameron Park when it was up and running?

574
00:33:45,076 --> 00:33:45,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

575
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:46,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

576
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:49,685
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, that place was incredible.

577
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:50,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan told me about the mineshaft.

578
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:54,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was, oh, I miss arcades.

579
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:55,749
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that part of it was underground.

580
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the mineshaft, it was a golf course.

581
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,611
[SPEAKER_03]: The golf course started underground.

582
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:01,171
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a mineshaft and you would go upstairs.

583
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It would go above ground after like the first three holes.

584
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:04,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the remnants of it.

585
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:09,396
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also, part of the arcade, there was a two-floor arcade.

586
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:12,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Upstairs had all the little kids games like Noah's Ark and stuff.

587
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And then downstairs, my God, they had everything.

588
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:16,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you can imagine.

589
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what, Arcade?

590
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:21,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is one of the last of the great arcades was the Birdcage Arcade that we had here.

591
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:24,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Birdcage... I'm sorry for people.

592
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:25,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is way out of that.

593
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,691
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where a lot of the new... We're having a moment, damn it.

594
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:32,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Birdcage Arcade got all of the new fighting games.

595
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:32,774
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.

596
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:34,716
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter if they had to import them.

597
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:35,596
[SPEAKER_00]: They got them.

598
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:55,373
[SPEAKER_00]: and we actually well at the time and I'm not going to say his name because a lot of people in the DDR community especially doesn't but a friend of ours worked for Capcom for a while and it was funny watching him just completely hand people their asses one handed you know at any of the fighting games and it was just like

599
00:34:56,554 --> 00:35:14,379
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was like right when I first moved out here and then they started tearing down all the stuff that made the birdcage area cool like the theater where Rocky was and the arcade and they're trying to take out the element that was they said they're trying to make it safer for better clientele but in reality I think that it's hurt the business there

600
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

601
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:36,783
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad.

602
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:37,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

603
00:35:58,194 --> 00:35:59,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam's Town Old Person's Moment

604
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:16,526
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

605
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:19,568
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just the fact that we had awesome shit and you don't.

606
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:22,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're reminiscing about better times, kids.

607
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:23,671
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

608
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:26,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that I didn't walk to school both ways uphill.

609
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:28,254
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whatever.

610
00:36:28,574 --> 00:36:28,814
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

611
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:29,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Jamie.

612
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:31,276
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do your story about... Oh, yeah.

613
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:32,376
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good story, right?

614
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong bad!

615
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:34,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Game.

616
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:44,983
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is called Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People made by Telltale and it is going to be an episodic humor game but guess what?

617
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:47,143
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delayed.

618
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:53,765
[SPEAKER_00]: It's release has been pushed to July.

619
00:36:54,665 --> 00:37:01,848
[SPEAKER_00]: It says from the original release month into the next month so from June to July to polish it up a little bit.

620
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:02,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Um

621
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:35,172
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh I really want to play this game because it's awesome and I love the trailers for it but well it's obviously directed at me because it does say awesome people but here's this is attractive people here's the thing if you want to know a little well that's me too if you want to know a little more about the real insight to what's going on here listen to the very end of Bobby Blackwolf show this week when we're on I'm not going to spoil it but he gives a little more insight as to what could be possibly up with this delay so I'll leave you with that little teaser I will be sure to

622
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:37,632
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

623
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:52,325
[SPEAKER_04]: You and I. There was an interesting job posting over at Nintendo's official website.

624
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:56,887
[SPEAKER_04]: The job posting was for a software hardware tester.

625
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:04,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And their description of duties would be creating and executing a test plan for Wii's USB devices.

626
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:11,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes on saying writing, testing, documentation, whatever.

627
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:14,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but the whole fact is that

628
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,001
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be Wii USB devices.

629
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:19,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Storage, perhaps?

630
00:38:19,543 --> 00:38:20,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard drive?

631
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:21,424
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG.

632
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:22,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

633
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be smart.

634
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:29,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Cross our fingers that that's what that actually means.

635
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

636
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:36,614
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN in chat says, Sky is so old he owes Nolan Bushnell a quarter.

637
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:37,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

638
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:38,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Asshole.

639
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, DarkSakura, you know what else I miss?

640
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Roller rinks.

641
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:43,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

642
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:50,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been to the one on Auburn, the Foothills Skating Rink, like in the last couple years.

643
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:51,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I went there too.

644
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:53,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still fucking awesome at it.

645
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:55,747
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

646
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to let this show get derailed.

647
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:57,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

648
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob and I are going to go roller skating next week and videotape it.

649
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost played DDR on roller skates once.

650
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:03,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you didn't want to be on camera.

651
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:04,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be on camera.

652
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:05,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be videotaping it.

653
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:06,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

654
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I wanted to go ice skating, actually.

655
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:09,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been.

656
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:09,795
Oh.

657
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate ice skating.

658
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:11,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Must happen.

659
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:12,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I love ice skating.

660
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:13,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

661
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:15,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's story.

662
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:19,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtual Console, SNK, what more do you need to know?

663
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,910
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of SNK stuff apparently heading to Virtual Console soon.

664
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:31,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just Samurai Showdown, as you heard in Part A, but apparently Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury 2, Burning Fight, they are all apparently on their way to the Virtual Console.

665
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:34,333
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the ESRB, of course, spilling all this.

666
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the list, Dig Dug is on the list.

667
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:40,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's probably not the arcade version, because you don't really see that on the Wii.

668
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:45,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the NES version, because it didn't really come out anywhere else that the Wii currently supports.

669
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:58,022
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, just so you know, also on the ESRB, it's completely unrelated, PlayStation 3, Ratings for the Last Guy, and Wipeout HD have both appeared, and hopefully that means that they are almost on their way.

670
00:39:58,623 --> 00:40:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll be looking forward to seeing those games soon, because Wipeout is kind of cool.

671
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:07,121
[SPEAKER_00]: GameStop is going to be giving away a download of a free Pokemon app.

672
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:28,461
[SPEAKER_00]: and forgive me if I mispronounce this but Deoxys which is a psychic type Pokemon that has four different forms.

673
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:37,625
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got Pokemon Diamond or Pearl you can go to a GameStop and download it and then they'll harass you about pre-ordering stuff.

674
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:41,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, you can have Pokemons.

675
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, it looks freaking bizarre.

676
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:52,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting comment from chat about kind of the tangent conversations we were having and it comes from Cyran who was kind of commenting earlier about being young and missing a lot of this.

677
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Says something very interesting.

678
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:56,966
[SPEAKER_03]: People Rob, Jamie, Matt's age had awesome arcades.

679
00:40:57,266 --> 00:41:02,688
[SPEAKER_03]: People in the 60s, my mom's generation, had Woodstock, The Beatles, The Summer of Love, and other cool things.

680
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:07,749
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of my generation just has the Iraq War, George Bush, and shitty music.

681
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,831
[SPEAKER_03]: The otaku demographic at least has somewhat of a boom of the anime industry but that's about it.

682
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,123
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very, very good summary of it.

683
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:19,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.

684
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:25,666
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably cool things about your generation, but you're not really going to realize them until like 20 years later.

685
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:28,727
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing is that, you know, right now in this, you know, 2000s.

686
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they ever come up with the name for this?

687
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:30,568
[SPEAKER_03]: The O's?

688
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,189
[SPEAKER_03]: The O-O's or whatever?

689
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:32,569
[SPEAKER_03]: The O's.

690
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:33,310
[SPEAKER_03]: The O's.

691
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:33,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

692
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in the O's, like the 80s are making a comeback.

693
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:39,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like how in the 90s, the 70s are making a comeback.

694
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

695
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:46,375
[SPEAKER_03]: When we start getting into the 10s, the 90s will make a comeback and all those things you forgot about will be cool again.

696
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:50,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So then again it's going to be the late 60s, early 70s look again.

697
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:51,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

698
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:55,758
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe in the 10s people are going to go back to the Victorian look.

699
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:59,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Which people kind of did in the early 80s now that I think about it.

700
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,100
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?

701
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:02,665
[SPEAKER_03]: People in Europe?

702
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:04,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I'm correct, zero is referred to as aught.

703
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, whatever, whatever.

704
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf brings up a good point.

705
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:50,232
[SPEAKER_03]: In 20 years, you may be telling young kids about how there was this internet where you could look up anything and read about anything and all information was equal, kind of referencing the net neutrality laws that are kind of making waves this week.

706
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:52,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

707
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys did grow up in the internet age.

708
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:55,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something.

709
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:57,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really have that when I was in early high school.

710
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It was BBSs for life, bitch.

711
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:09,435
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were some of these people's age, the internet actually was still military only and illegal for anyone else to network.

712
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:11,296
[SPEAKER_03]: You totally just said when I was your age.

713
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:19,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we were little, it was true.

714
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:25,436
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet's been in existence since, I do believe, 1972 or 74, around that time.

715
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:26,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever Al Gore invented it, right?

716
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:27,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever.

717
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:36,985
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was military use only, and if anyone was caught networking in the early 80s or so, they actually could be arrested for it.

718
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:37,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

719
00:43:38,386 --> 00:43:48,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I remember my friend's dad, who's in his, I guess, 60s now, is an engineer, and he was talking about lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.

720
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:52,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty crazy.

721
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,741
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, anyway.

722
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thought that might be a little perspective.

723
00:43:57,183 --> 00:43:58,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of reminiscing tonight.

724
00:43:59,185 --> 00:44:00,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

725
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:01,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, kids.

726
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

727
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:31,024
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, though, I'm glad to see that it looks like around August they're going to be coming towards San Jose.

728
00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:33,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be able to hit that up, actually.

729
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:45,968
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, all over the place, including, you know, Canada, France, Scotland, United States, Portugal, and Brazil.

730
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:46,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Brazil.

731
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:53,388
[SPEAKER_04]: China, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Moscow, Russia, and Norway and Sweden.

732
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:56,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they say world tour, they don't mean just like US and Canada.

733
00:44:56,554 --> 00:44:57,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They mean the freaking world.

734
00:44:57,957 --> 00:44:58,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

735
00:44:58,598 --> 00:44:59,179
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

736
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:00,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be fun to travel on.

737
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was distracted because they're telling Commodore 64 jokes in chat and that's just all kinds of awesome.

738
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:38,620
[SPEAKER_00]: But not as awesome as... Dude, I used to play Kix on an Apple IIe.

739
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:41,487
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

740
00:46:04,352 --> 00:46:05,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The Boobs have their own value?

741
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:26,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently people noticed, and they actually have before and after shots here on various websites.

742
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what that means.

743
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:30,497
[SPEAKER_04]: If something can be shrunk, it can be made bigger.

744
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:39,344
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I love, is that the company actually posted a clarification saying, quote, your breasts should be back to normal soon.

745
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:44,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for saving the day.

746
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,853
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, it should be noted, man boobs were not affected at all.

747
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:52,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Man boobs were safe.

748
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:58,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Also safe this week, your emails, but not for much longer because we're about to turn DarkSakura loose on them.

749
00:46:58,795 --> 00:46:59,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for very much longer?

750
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:02,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for very much longer.

751
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:07,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to open the mailbag.

752
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:08,761
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I am.

753
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Here we go, DarkSakura, take it away.

754
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:14,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff.

755
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:18,126
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best, this is like my email of the week just because of how it ends.

756
00:47:18,907 --> 00:47:21,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rob and DarkSakura, how goes it?

757
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:21,949
[SPEAKER_00]: What about Loki?

758
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:22,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine, thanks.

759
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi to Loki too.

760
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,051
[SPEAKER_03]: F Loki.

761
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:27,914
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tybon and I'm currently living in Kenya with my sisters.

762
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:31,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I'm not going to think of Power Thirst.

763
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,341
[SPEAKER_00]: The region here is really poor, but we're fortunate enough to be able to afford and import video games from Europe.

764
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:41,523
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally got hold of Grand Theft Auto, and I've been enjoying it a lot.

765
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:46,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much to say, just wanted to say hi and let you guys know that you've got listeners all around the world.

766
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:50,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to the podcast every week for the past year now, and it's one of my favorites.

767
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:51,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.

768
00:47:51,527 --> 00:47:51,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Tybon.

769
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:56,509
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is brought to you by Samara's Cafe, home of the never-ending dirt.

770
00:47:58,799 --> 00:47:59,699
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought was awesome.

771
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,220
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.

772
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you read my email on the show.

773
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll definitely make my week.

774
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, look.

775
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:04,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you totally just got punked.

776
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:07,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the reason why.

777
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I saw that email sitting in there.

778
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the sender name.

779
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:13,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not match the person who says they are.

780
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:14,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

781
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:21,247
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the reason why I thought it was awesome was because of the never-ending dirt.

782
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:24,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I want this person to prove that they're actually in Kenya.

783
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:25,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow.

784
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:27,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Send us a picture of Kenya.

785
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:30,972
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be standing in front of a building, flying the Kenya flag.

786
00:48:31,232 --> 00:48:31,732
No.

787
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:33,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Making a gang sign or something.

788
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:34,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

789
00:48:34,374 --> 00:48:36,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Making the OLR gang sign, whatever that is.

790
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:37,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Take us a picture of Samara's Cafe.

791
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:40,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, we want a picture of Samara's Cafe.

792
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:41,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

793
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And the never-ending dirt.

794
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:43,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

795
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:49,365
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still now... The other reason I'm thinking it's awesome is I'm also thinking of Power Thirst now.

796
00:48:50,353 --> 00:48:55,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm thinking, why would someone send us... And I apologize if we're not getting punked.

797
00:48:55,095 --> 00:48:56,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Just realize my suspicions.

798
00:48:56,836 --> 00:48:58,917
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple things about your email raised some eyebrows.

799
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:01,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you punk us with that?

800
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,200
[SPEAKER_03]: You crazy kids.

801
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:08,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm thinking that it could be a nickname too.

802
00:49:08,402 --> 00:49:09,843
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to suspend...

803
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,040
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that's right.

804
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize profusely if you are the real deal.

805
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:18,245
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a legitimate person that lives in Kenya, you know what?

806
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:20,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm going to save the email and I'm going to run it through an IP hunt.

807
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:22,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh, there you go.

808
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:23,790
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

809
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we are coming out and saying it.

810
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that we never expected to get email from Kenya.

811
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, we have a caller who calls from... We get Sweden, we get Argentina, we get... Why not Kenya?

812
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:37,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

813
00:49:38,202 --> 00:49:38,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?

814
00:49:38,923 --> 00:49:42,530
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want somebody from Wales to call me so I can listen to a sexy Welsh accent.

815
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

816
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:50,201
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Robert M. Just a quick thought about the Wii storage.

817
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:55,765
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to download virtual console and WiiWare titles, game saves seem to take a pretty big chunk of hard drive space.

818
00:49:56,266 --> 00:50:00,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Elebits, for instance, uses about 100 blocks and Brawl save files well over 120.

819
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:07,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume the EA Sports games use large blocks as well, as most likely will the upcoming Animal Crossing game.

820
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:12,257
[SPEAKER_00]: The GameCube one actually fills an entire gray memory card and comes with a spare card for that reason.

821
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:24,952
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a game that uses WFC and you can't move the save to your SD card for backup, I have no idea what should be done about this.

822
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:30,816
[SPEAKER_00]: How many free blocks does a clean Wii with nothing but the disc channel and no game saves have anyway?

823
00:50:31,656 --> 00:50:39,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Mario Kart Wii from my Gamefly list and I haven't gotten online with it yet since I've been busy with other things, mostly Dr. Mario Online RX.

824
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:44,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone there or in OL Army has a chance to compete in that one?

825
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:48,881
[SPEAKER_03]: He asked a good question.

826
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:49,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually not sure.

827
00:50:49,562 --> 00:50:51,822
[SPEAKER_03]: How many blocks come on a brand new Wii?

828
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:53,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it like 1,400 about?

829
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:54,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the chat room is a little better.

830
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:55,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

831
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:57,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I think blocks are stupid for measurement anyways on there.

832
00:50:58,164 --> 00:50:58,684
[SPEAKER_04]: True that.

833
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:00,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fucking...

834
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

835
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:02,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

836
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:02,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just saying hey.

837
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:03,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

838
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:03,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

839
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:31,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a long-time listener from Canada known as D-Vay in the chat room.

840
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:32,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

841
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jamie.

842
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:34,424
[SPEAKER_03]: What do gay horses eat?

843
00:51:35,585 --> 00:51:36,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

844
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:39,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

845
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do the other joke.

846
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, listener from Canada.

847
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:52,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Loki is all into PSP hacks and homebrew stuff like that, but recently I just bought myself a DS with a flash cart that I ordered online.

848
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,193
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a ninja pass!

849
00:51:54,353 --> 00:52:00,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my question to Loki is, have you experienced with DS homebrew before or do you even give a shit?

850
00:52:01,337 --> 00:52:04,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you have any good links that can guide me in the right passage?

851
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys for making my weekly days and keep up the good work.

852
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:14,376
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I was going to submit a GTA Radio entry if it weren't for my MacBook crapping out on me.

853
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:19,044
[SPEAKER_00]: This message has been brought to you by Olive Garden Home and the never-ending flow of saggy granny birthday parties.

854
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:20,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

855
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:22,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

856
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:22,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear not.

857
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:23,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still trying to get that portal win.

858
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:27,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I am told that all games is going to be stepping up the number of contests that they do.

859
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be more opportunities to get in on the fun and big prizes eventually.

860
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:37,470
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a best message brought to you by contest for our emails.

861
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some stuff to give away and I think we're going to do it next week.

862
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:41,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

863
00:52:42,294 --> 00:52:42,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an idea.

864
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,019
[SPEAKER_00]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

865
00:53:09,631 --> 00:53:11,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's the only problem right now.

866
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:18,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know someone who does regular shipments of them, because if you order 10 of them, you get free shipping or something.

867
00:53:18,937 --> 00:53:21,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time this goes on, I'll let you know.

868
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it still doesn't make me not poor.

869
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I plan on buying one, because they look cool.

870
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:34,707
[SPEAKER_04]: My whole thing before was, if I was ever going to buy one, it was just to play import games on anyways.

871
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:36,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

872
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:56,902
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much the only interest I have on that stuff.

873
00:53:57,462 --> 00:53:58,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Team OE for that matter.

874
00:53:58,962 --> 00:54:00,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Play all import games sometimes.

875
00:54:01,023 --> 00:54:02,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even really play that many import games.

876
00:54:04,003 --> 00:54:07,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mainly while I play Mario Kart, but that's not important.

877
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:09,605
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

878
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:11,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm going to be importing a game.

879
00:54:12,805 --> 00:54:13,286
[SPEAKER_03]: What could that be?

880
00:54:14,086 --> 00:54:18,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have a new 2DX controller, I'm actually thinking about importing Happy Sky.

881
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:19,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

882
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay you to build me an arcade style controller.

883
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:48,623
[SPEAKER_04]: For poppin' music?

884
00:54:48,803 --> 00:54:52,245
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for... Well, for poppin' music, yeah, too, because I have a bunch of poppin' music, too.

885
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:54,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the full-size buttons for it.

886
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:55,767
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like eight bucks each.

887
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:57,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

888
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:57,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

889
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:04,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, next email comes from one of our listeners in the UK.

890
00:55:04,874 --> 00:55:06,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, OLR, it's Guy.

891
00:55:06,395 --> 00:55:07,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Guy.

892
00:55:07,535 --> 00:55:07,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Guy.

893
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:09,419
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cute.

894
00:55:33,877 --> 00:55:38,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we did kind of talk about it in Part A that worldwide they've sold 8.5 million copies.

895
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that worldwide or just here in America that they sold 8.5 million?

896
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:42,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably worldwide, right?

897
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:43,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's worldwide.

898
00:55:43,922 --> 00:55:45,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And 11 million have gone to store shelves.

899
00:55:45,983 --> 00:55:47,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been doing very well.

900
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:51,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would tend to once say the majority of that is happening in America.

901
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, I'm not really hearing a lot of it's too much like the others.

902
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:59,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, honestly, if it is too much like the others, that's okay for a lot of people here.

903
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:04,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, honestly, and you know me, I wasn't at all interested in Grand Theft Auto 4.

904
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:10,112
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dan's been borrowing our friend George's copy for a while, and he's been kind of getting into it.

905
00:56:10,512 --> 00:56:18,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually doing the missions, and his friend Will's been just fucking off on everything in that game and doing whatever the hell he wanted to and trying to get as drunk as possible.

906
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,575
[SPEAKER_00]: He got so drunk on his character that he couldn't walk.

907
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:21,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was funny.

908
00:56:22,515 --> 00:56:29,078
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I've actually kind of gotten into watching them play it just because I like picking out stuff.

909
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:31,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Pisswater reference, that cracked me the hell up.

910
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something else to consider.

911
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:35,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto has been selling systems here.

912
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:36,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It has.

913
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,403
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3s especially.

914
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:43,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's name recognition or what, but there's a lot of people that have been picking out PS3s just for this game.

915
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:44,926
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sony Grill.

916
00:56:46,427 --> 00:56:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And Blu-ray player too.

917
00:56:48,308 --> 00:56:50,569
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, ooh, it plays Blu-rays and Grand Theft Auto.

918
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:51,870
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cook's Burgers.

919
00:56:52,495 --> 00:56:55,997
[SPEAKER_00]: so there you go thank you Guy bye Guy bye Guy

920
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:58,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, and girl.

921
00:56:58,958 --> 00:56:59,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

922
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I'm awesome.

923
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my own hello.

924
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:05,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I have been listening for about four years.

925
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:06,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, four years.

926
00:57:07,483 --> 00:57:09,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hardly ever email you, but I thought this was worth it.

927
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:15,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in an office job and often listen to music, and one time I decided I should listen to your podcast at work.

928
00:57:15,868 --> 00:57:24,133
[SPEAKER_00]: It entertained me so well for the three hours that it makes the rest of the day pass by incredibly slowly, and not even my music is working anymore.

929
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:29,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I have even dipped into some archives just to have something to listen to that good.

930
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried a few other podcasts, but nothing compared.

931
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:32,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep up the good work.

932
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the tangents, so never let them end.

933
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:35,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you got a lot of them tonight.

934
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from Saltech.

935
00:57:37,648 --> 00:57:39,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, he has the best email ever.

936
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:40,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And...

937
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:45,052
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants your email bad.

938
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:05,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say though, we've actually kind of heard a lot about... In fact, part B has been kind of late the past two weeks and that's my fault.

939
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've actually been kind of getting flack from the people who listen to us at work.

940
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:12,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why weren't we up for them to listen to Thursday or Friday at work?

941
00:58:12,744 --> 00:58:17,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know there's a lot of people that use us to pass the day by at work and I really, really apologize for that.

942
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:20,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we are only three hours of show a week.

943
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:47,332
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know hopefully maybe one day we'll be able to put out a little more other specials and things but if you're looking for other shows that are quality check out our family at allgames.com there's some great shows there will you like all of them probably not because the shows all talk about different types of games you know and there's but that's kind of what makes the network cool is that you have different gamer bases talking about all different types of things there's bound to be at least one other show on there you're like what were you laughing at Loki yeah

944
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing?

945
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:50,737
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

946
00:58:51,718 --> 00:58:52,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Read an email, DarkSakura.

947
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to spy on Loki and see what he's watching.

948
00:58:55,162 --> 00:59:01,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do want to thank Rob with 2Bs who sent us presents for our 6th anniversary.

949
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:07,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will check them out in a bit, but I wanted to thank you very much for sending us your MyCookRewards.

950
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I saw that too, so big thank you.

951
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:16,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We will definitely figure out a way to work those in to our anniversary show.

952
00:59:16,694 --> 00:59:17,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing he's watching.

953
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:18,315
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

954
00:59:18,715 --> 00:59:20,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw was telling me about this before the show.

955
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:20,776
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

956
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:27,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone has done a shot-for-shot remake of the introduction to the Naked Gun, but in Grand Theft Auto 4.

957
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine.

958
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:31,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They have recreated the intro to the Naked Gun.

959
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:33,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki's laughing his ass off over here.

960
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look for that when I get home.

961
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw will give you the link.

962
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:36,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Just...

963
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,682
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw, send it to the mailbag so Jamie can look it up at home.

964
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:43,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, XXOO.

965
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:44,544
[SPEAKER_03]: More emails?

966
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:45,365
[SPEAKER_00]: One more.

967
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

968
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:46,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Unamas.

969
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:47,126
[SPEAKER_00]: One more.

970
00:59:48,347 --> 00:59:49,808
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from Geekboy.

971
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:52,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I'm about to get a 360.

972
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:58,274
[SPEAKER_00]: If I like first person shooters, what would I get except for the obvious ones?

973
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:01,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other game recommendations will be thanked.

974
01:00:01,656 --> 01:00:02,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

975
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:03,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.

976
01:00:04,258 --> 01:00:05,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, what system was it?

977
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:05,338
360. 360.

978
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:08,462
[SPEAKER_03]: 360 first-person shooters.

979
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:09,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Duty 4.

980
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:12,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

981
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:18,488
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of, when you say besides the obvious ones, well, the obvious ones are the good ones usually.

982
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:19,809
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they're kind of obvious.

983
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of, I don't know.

984
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:28,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, you're probably asking the wrong people because I don't think a lot of us are super into first-person shooters as much as we are, say, RPGs and adventure games.

985
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:30,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not myself.

986
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:37,417
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say this, Orange Box, if you overlook that, some great first... Not just Portal, but Half-Life, Half-Life 2.

987
01:00:37,557 --> 01:00:39,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Half-Life 2 was freaking great.

988
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:41,078
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the best first-person shooter deal.

989
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a better deal than Halo, because Halo is just one game.

990
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:44,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Box is like five.

991
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:53,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I know I might take a little flack for saying this, and it's not really for hardcore first-person players, but I liked Prey.

992
01:00:53,242 --> 01:00:54,582
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot about Prey I liked.

993
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:55,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw says Iron Man.

994
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:56,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think...

995
01:00:57,163 --> 01:00:58,324
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

996
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like $10 probably at this point.

997
01:01:19,823 --> 01:01:21,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's my recommendation, I guess.

998
01:01:21,983 --> 01:01:30,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was checking this, and I think that it's because the Kenya email was a Gmail account.

999
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reading an America IP.

1000
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:41,030
[SPEAKER_00]: But Google is international, and they do run out of the United States.

1001
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:41,730
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

1002
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Send us a picture of this America cafe.

1003
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:46,232
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for the picture of the cafe.

1004
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:47,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Or either... Look...

1005
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:52,242
[SPEAKER_03]: either send us a picture of the cafe or fess up that you were fake and just tell us why.

1006
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:53,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't care at this point.

1007
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,705
[SPEAKER_03]: We read the email, but I've got to know why that.

1008
01:01:55,785 --> 01:01:57,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did she have to read that?

1009
01:01:57,886 --> 01:01:58,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, was it a dare?

1010
01:01:58,867 --> 01:01:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

1011
01:01:59,748 --> 01:01:59,988
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1012
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:01,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

1013
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:06,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm checking the inbox to see if we got a... No, but we did get one.

1014
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:06,919
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Pokemans.

1015
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:08,340
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read it next week.

1016
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:08,800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1017
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So tune in next week for more Mailbag.

1018
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:18,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, speaking of interactivity, the Skypline will be open very soon, but we got two more stories for you before we get to the Skypline, which we're kind of keeping short tonight.

1019
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:25,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to keep our show a little short tonight because we've got other things we've got to get to for tomorrow, but we will get at least a couple calls in after these two quick stories.

1020
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:25,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1021
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:30,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Home is coming out this year, so says Sony.

1022
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:39,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, they say now it's going to be released in the fall as an open working beta.

1023
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:44,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's a fancy way of saying, well, it's not really done yet, but we're releasing it anyways.

1024
01:02:45,603 --> 01:02:49,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, when they think about it, I guess it's kind of like every single game that comes out nowadays anyways.

1025
01:02:49,761 --> 01:02:55,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, pretty much anything Google does and Google launches is a beta.

1026
01:02:55,883 --> 01:03:03,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like that thing where it's like, well, we're launching this and it's going to have all these awesome features, but don't blame us if it sucks because it's a beta.

1027
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:05,347
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.

1028
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:09,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That may work for Google because they're always improving their services and stuff.

1029
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:10,790
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1030
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:37,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1031
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:39,238
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's coming out, I guess.

1032
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And either way, people have been playing it in beta.

1033
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:43,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1034
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:47,801
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I don't think Home is going to be as big as they're hoping it's going to be.

1035
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:50,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are going to find it as being a big waste of time.

1036
01:03:52,103 --> 01:03:52,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1037
01:03:55,924 --> 01:03:56,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the dead air there.

1038
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:59,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I was typing some things in chat real quick.

1039
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:00,626
[SPEAKER_00]: He was typing of the dead.

1040
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:02,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I was typing of the dead, and I won.

1041
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:02,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I got 100%.

1042
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil 5 you know they've kind of been accused of being racist and so on I don't know if you heard about that but you know because in the trailers and stuff you know whatever but here's the thing is that the producer of Resident Evil 5 Jun Takushi has actually denied saying there's nothing racist about this game y'all are just misunderstanding the original trailer which I would believe because people are too freaking sensitive nowadays come on anybody can be a zombie regardless of race can we all agree on that I agree

1043
01:04:35,949 --> 01:04:36,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go ahead.

1044
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:36,429
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1045
01:04:55,345 --> 01:05:15,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in the Japanese Biohazard, when you go in the room, and I hope this is not Chris' bloodline and everything, and so you go into the other room, there's a zombie chewing off the neck of one of the team members who had been in there before, and his head pops off and rolls off, and it looks like Michael Jordan.

1046
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:18,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's supposed to, in however PS1 graphics did.

1047
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:23,889
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut that out on the US version in that cinematic.

1048
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:29,352
[SPEAKER_00]: They also cut out the part with Chris lighting up a cigarette with this huge lighter.

1049
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:37,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Japanese version of Biohazard, so it's no big freaking deal.

1050
01:05:38,556 --> 01:05:40,457
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought that that was the same thing.

1051
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:41,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

1052
01:05:42,168 --> 01:05:51,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, speaking of characters and stuff, there is a new character in the game who is a black female who's going to have a role in Resident Evil 5 as somebody you can actually include.

1053
01:05:51,773 --> 01:06:01,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And see, here's the thing, is that the question was asked, did you put this character in because of the fact that the trailer showed that you're blowing up people in Africa and that they're all the zombies and stuff?

1054
01:06:02,419 --> 01:06:05,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And Takushi said, no, she's pretty much been there in the beginning.

1055
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:08,682
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the reaction, we're in the business of entertainment.

1056
01:06:08,963 --> 01:06:11,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't set out to make a racist game or a political statement.

1057
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:23,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We did feel there was a misunderstanding about the initial trailer, which probably was just some people being a little bit oversensitive, I think, because, you know, anybody can be a zombie, right?

1058
01:06:27,009 --> 01:06:29,330
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't see a lot of fat zombies in Resident Evil, do you?

1059
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:29,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you do.

1060
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

1061
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:37,372
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a cop in the first one who died, and then he came back as a fat zombie.

1062
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:39,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1063
01:06:39,513 --> 01:06:39,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1064
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,837
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my video game trivia.

1065
01:06:42,857 --> 01:06:44,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1066
01:06:45,282 --> 01:06:49,445
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to go to the Skype line here, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1067
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:55,470
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I'm told that there is a very important voicemail we're supposed to play that was left in the box last night.

1068
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:58,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just thinking about what goes on Saturday.

1069
01:06:58,092 --> 01:06:58,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It was overnight.

1070
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:02,796
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm thinking about things that go on on All Games Radio on Saturday night.

1071
01:07:02,816 --> 01:07:03,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sweet.

1072
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a little bit worried about this one.

1073
01:07:05,178 --> 01:07:11,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go play this voicemail and kind of hope that it's not too strange.

1074
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:11,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1075
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:15,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It's downloading.

1076
01:07:42,386 --> 01:07:45,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.

1077
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:48,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.

1078
01:07:48,391 --> 01:07:49,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that commercial.

1079
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:52,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's 30 seconds of all your lives you'll never get back either.

1080
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:55,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, every second of your life is a second you'll never get back.

1081
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says we just got bucket rolled.

1082
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:01,181
[SPEAKER_03]: What the crap?

1083
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:02,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the new thing now?

1084
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:05,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that replaced Rickrolling?

1085
01:08:06,098 --> 01:08:09,961
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, by the way, I went to a sushi restaurant last night.

1086
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:12,443
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Jim, his birthday, he's turning 30.

1087
01:08:12,503 --> 01:08:13,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday, Jim, if you're listening.

1088
01:08:14,104 --> 01:08:14,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1089
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:18,608
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have a sushi roll called the Rick-O-Roll.

1090
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:21,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you believe that?

1091
01:08:21,089 --> 01:08:23,111
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually now have sushi called the Rick-Roll.

1092
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:25,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get a... Screw all of you!

1093
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:27,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they have Ricky-O as like a...

1094
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:46,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Asian, Kung Fu I don't know, but of course the whole table looked at it and went, ha ha ha, Rickroll, ha ha ha And I was just like, Rickrolls need to die in a boat fire Underwater volcano, that whole thing Alright, we got calls We got calls, let's go to the Skype line Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1095
01:08:47,014 --> 01:08:56,336
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin, long time no hear Well, hello RavensDolphin Damn, it's been a long time since you've managed to be the first caller here on OLR What is on your mind, my friend?

1096
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,077
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, what the hell have you been up to?

1097
01:08:59,103 --> 01:08:59,904
[SPEAKER_03]: DeadPixelLive

1098
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:25,255
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, there you have it here on All Games Radio.

1099
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:25,855
[SPEAKER_03]: What time do you start?

1100
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,357
[SPEAKER_03]: You just start whenever All Games finishes?

1101
01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:35,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, whenever they reach out and they said, all right, they pull the plug, and then we start with our... The other host is Derek H. Very cool.

1102
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:39,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Derek H. likes our show, though, which makes me a sad panda.

1103
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:40,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.

1104
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:41,890
[SPEAKER_03]: One half does.

1105
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:42,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Why doesn't he love me?

1106
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know why doesn't Derek H. love me.

1107
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:46,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1108
01:09:46,635 --> 01:09:47,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't my fault.

1109
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I love him.

1110
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:50,649
[SPEAKER_03]: You pass along that message.

1111
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:52,090
[SPEAKER_03]: We here at OLR, we love Derek.

1112
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,411
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope that that love is reciprocated.

1113
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:56,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

1114
01:09:56,632 --> 01:09:57,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things.

1115
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:01,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about Microsoft and the Blu-ray thing.

1116
01:10:01,354 --> 01:10:02,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's dumb.

1117
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:03,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it dumb?

1118
01:10:03,896 --> 01:10:06,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's BS or do you think the idea itself is dumb?

1119
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:09,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's dumb in general.

1120
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, hey, MGS4 is coming.

1121
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:14,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, we must combat it with a Blu-ray player.

1122
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:17,903
[SPEAKER_06]: It just feels like it shouldn't be necessary until the Xbox 720.

1123
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no, because right now, why are a lot of people buying PlayStation 3s right now?

1124
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:34,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of said this earlier in the show, because it plays Grand Theft Auto 4 and Blu-rays, whereas Xbox 360 only plays Grand Theft Auto 4 right now.

1125
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a movie system.

1126
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:39,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay DVDs, but everybody has a freaking DVD player at this point, right?

1127
01:10:39,312 --> 01:10:40,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of people are looking for that in their systems.

1128
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:49,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And people, I think, the normal average Joe, I'm not a gamer, but I enjoy the occasional violent video game, right?

1129
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:55,219
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know about all this, like, download exclusive Xbox 360 stuff.

1130
01:10:55,539 --> 01:10:56,659
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know about all that stuff.

1131
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,800
[SPEAKER_03]: They just think it's the same damn game.

1132
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:00,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1133
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:02,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just something to consider.

1134
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:09,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I agree with Loki when he said, if they bundle, like, a new one in, I feel like that's suicide.

1135
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:09,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1136
01:11:11,343 --> 01:11:12,824
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1137
01:11:35,615 --> 01:11:37,096
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1138
01:11:58,697 --> 01:12:04,793
[SPEAKER_06]: because Rainbow Bright, it's all dark and gloomy, and you have to fill the world with color, and this is what the game does.

1139
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You fill the world with color.

1140
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:07,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1141
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was the evil guy in Rainbow Bride?

1142
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember his name.

1143
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:16,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Murky and Lurky.

1144
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:20,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I was thinking of the peculiar purple pie man.

1145
01:12:20,393 --> 01:12:22,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I keep thinking of Strawberry Shortcake too.

1146
01:12:23,554 --> 01:12:25,335
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so easy to get confused, I guess.

1147
01:12:25,935 --> 01:12:26,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, forget it.

1148
01:12:26,816 --> 01:12:28,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Evans Dolphin, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1149
01:12:30,277 --> 01:12:32,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Pigs Alive, right after All Games Interactive.

1150
01:12:32,438 --> 01:12:33,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug, plug.

1151
01:12:33,618 --> 01:12:34,139
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1152
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:34,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

1153
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1154
01:13:01,069 --> 01:13:01,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator.

1155
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator.

1156
01:13:03,431 --> 01:13:05,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Need to go buy on the PlayStation Network.

1157
01:13:05,793 --> 01:13:06,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1158
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:07,455
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Spazinator?

1159
01:13:08,616 --> 01:13:10,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a couple things.

1160
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:15,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Much of which you kind of sort of touched on on tonight's show, especially in part one.

1161
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:27,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I do have one concern about Soul Calibur 4, which is going to be coming out next month with all the characters from Star Wars and whatnot.

1162
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:39,265
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think about it, you know how in all the Star Wars movies supposedly the lightsabers pretty much cut through 99% of everything out there?

1163
01:13:40,325 --> 01:13:43,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Like limbs and walls and stuff like that?

1164
01:13:44,927 --> 01:13:56,111
[SPEAKER_09]: In theory, if they want the Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur IV to be totally active and whatnot, wouldn't they be way overpowered and whatnot?

1165
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:56,871
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like

1166
01:13:57,423 --> 01:14:03,047
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, cut off people's legs and, you know, totally break down the characters' weapons and whatnot?

1167
01:14:04,087 --> 01:14:08,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, you know, they're probably just going to balance it.

1168
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, you know, when things have crossed over before.

1169
01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:13,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, when Spawn and Link and all those characters showed up before.

1170
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:15,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they just kind of made it work.

1171
01:14:15,575 --> 01:14:16,455
[SPEAKER_03]: They just balanced it.

1172
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:17,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just what they're going to do here.

1173
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:20,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and all these kind of crossover games.

1174
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:23,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like Capcom versus X-Men.

1175
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:26,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly superheroes would overpower these, you know...

1176
01:14:27,182 --> 01:14:27,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1177
01:14:50,683 --> 01:14:55,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I have no doubt that the game's going to be good.

1178
01:14:55,906 --> 01:15:04,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of both a Soul Calibur fan and a Star Wars nut, so that thought did kind of cross my mind like a week ago.

1179
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're okay with this?

1180
01:15:07,071 --> 01:15:11,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people in our chat room earlier were kind of like, oh, why can't they just make Star Wars its own game?

1181
01:15:11,313 --> 01:15:13,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they have to have all these Star Wars characters?

1182
01:15:13,354 --> 01:15:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You're okay with both kind of living together in the same game?

1183
01:15:17,016 --> 01:15:17,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1184
01:15:18,116 --> 01:15:19,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just that little...

1185
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:30,758
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw made a very similar observation to what you're saying.

1186
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:35,100
[SPEAKER_03]: He says in chat here, That's one of the things I noticed when I saw the gameplay footage of Vader and SoulCalibur IV.

1187
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: He can literally impale an opponent and throw them.

1188
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:41,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, a lightsaber would cut through someone effortlessly.

1189
01:15:42,043 --> 01:15:42,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

1190
01:15:43,424 --> 01:15:44,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

1191
01:15:44,884 --> 01:15:46,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a low wattage.

1192
01:15:47,034 --> 01:15:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Spazinator, do you think they ought to make a new Star Wars fighting game?

1193
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:55,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if this does really well, do you think Namco needs to be paid a lot of money to make a new Star Wars fighting game?

1194
01:15:56,017 --> 01:15:57,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we'll just pretend the other one never happened?

1195
01:15:58,418 --> 01:16:10,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, now that you mention it, I did buy the first one for the PlayStation 1 when it came out, and I wouldn't necessarily say it was horrible, like E.T.

1196
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:11,383
[SPEAKER_09]: for its 2600 badge.

1197
01:16:12,918 --> 01:16:17,982
[SPEAKER_09]: but it wasn't exactly game of the year like Final Fantasy 7 great either, you know.

1198
01:16:18,082 --> 01:16:19,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of like middle of the road for me.

1199
01:16:21,365 --> 01:16:25,688
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to a new Star Wars fighting game, though.

1200
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:30,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this is Namco putting their feet in the water a little bit and seeing if it's possible.

1201
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:31,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1202
01:16:31,513 --> 01:16:31,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1203
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:32,774
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hope.

1204
01:16:33,935 --> 01:16:34,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

1205
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:35,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go ahead.

1206
01:16:35,976 --> 01:16:36,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1207
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:39,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, is there anything else you want to talk about before we go, Spazinator?

1208
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:39,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1209
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:56,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that you've kind of gone away from Final Fantasy XI and more into WoW, but that was notwithstanding, have you heard anything about a fan festival like what they had in Anaheim last year?

1210
01:16:58,203 --> 01:17:03,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not, but from what I understand, Squeenix usually announces those things pretty last minute.

1211
01:17:03,105 --> 01:17:06,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not like, you know, the day before, but they'll only give like two months notice.

1212
01:17:07,066 --> 01:17:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas with Blizzard, you know, they've already announced, hey, BlizzCon's gonna happen, mark the date.

1213
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's because BlizzCon gets a hell of a lot more people, not just because they have WoW, but they also have StarCraft and, you know, some of those other, you know, powerhouse games and Diablo 3 rumors are enough to get people to go too.

1214
01:17:22,765 --> 01:17:23,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard anything, though.

1215
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:31,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I left Final Fantasy XI, I do keep tabs on the news just to see if there's anything really cool I'm missing out on.

1216
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:31,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1217
01:17:32,172 --> 01:17:35,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent so much time with that freaking game, you can't help but just kind of be curious about it.

1218
01:17:36,314 --> 01:17:38,215
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like a bad relationship.

1219
01:17:38,856 --> 01:17:41,197
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't help but wonder, whatever happened to your ex?

1220
01:17:42,718 --> 01:17:43,459
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1221
01:17:43,499 --> 01:17:47,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I've been playing the PlayStation 2 version of the game for...

1222
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:51,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, two and a half years now, and I'm practically addicted to it.

1223
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:54,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Even now that I got to play season three.

1224
01:17:55,088 --> 01:18:09,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason I ask my question is, in theory, if they hold the Fan Festival this year, this will be the first year I can actually afford to literally go cross-country and go to the Fan Festival.

1225
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:15,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what I've been told, some of my friends are going to be over there, and I've been just dying to go to the festival.

1226
01:18:17,857 --> 01:18:21,098
[SPEAKER_03]: If they hold it in California, I might actually try to go.

1227
01:18:21,118 --> 01:18:22,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it might be a lot of fun.

1228
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if it's within driving distance.

1229
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they had one of them in Santa Cruz.

1230
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:25,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not that far.

1231
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:27,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could have gone to that.

1232
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just didn't know about it until after it already happened.

1233
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was when I was not really playing.

1234
01:18:34,061 --> 01:18:37,482
[SPEAKER_03]: As a video game journalist, to report on the event.

1235
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:41,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for taking my call.

1236
01:18:42,003 --> 01:18:42,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You are welcome.

1237
01:18:42,823 --> 01:18:45,484
[SPEAKER_03]: We like hearing from people that we don't get to hear from very often.

1238
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:46,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So take care, alright?

1239
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just thought of something, and then I'll let you go.

1240
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:59,026
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, earlier in the show you were asking about that new Commando 3 game.

1241
01:18:59,387 --> 01:19:05,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 next week, and it's already out for the PS3.

1242
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:13,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I already got the game, and I don't know if there's going to be a difference between the two versions, but at least the PlayStation 3 game is pretty good.

1243
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:15,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a good sign.

1244
01:19:15,095 --> 01:19:15,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1245
01:19:15,962 --> 01:19:23,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you guys got the 360 or the PS3, I would seriously suggest investing the $10 for the game.

1246
01:19:23,987 --> 01:19:29,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely check out the demo and see if it's worth it because I am tempted by the beta of the new Street Fighter because I do heart Street Fighter.

1247
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:31,472
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I guess that's true.

1248
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:35,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already out on PS3, so it's good to know that the game's not bad so that you're not wasting your $10.

1249
01:19:36,296 --> 01:19:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see when that demo comes out.

1250
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:39,438
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1251
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:40,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, have a good one.

1252
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:40,939
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1253
01:19:40,959 --> 01:19:41,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Spazinator.

1254
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:42,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for your call.

1255
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:42,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

1256
01:19:44,021 --> 01:19:44,221
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1257
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:48,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we're going to call it a night.

1258
01:19:48,573 --> 01:19:49,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1259
01:19:49,574 --> 01:19:49,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1260
01:19:51,155 --> 01:19:51,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1261
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Legend of Zaku.

1262
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:55,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Legend of Zaku.

1263
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:58,078
[SPEAKER_00]: No show is complete without a call from Legend of Zaku.

1264
01:19:58,098 --> 01:19:58,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn right.

1265
01:19:58,479 --> 01:19:59,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been far too long.

1266
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:00,960
[SPEAKER_03]: What is on your mind, Zaku?

1267
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:10,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much, just basically just enjoying all my usual games on my 360, like Grand Theft Auto 4 and whatnot.

1268
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:14,648
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you upgraded to a 360 not too long ago, huh?

1269
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been like about six months.

1270
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of games have you been playing?

1271
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:21,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto, obviously.

1272
01:20:21,952 --> 01:20:28,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Kicked the shit out of Call of Duty 4 on Veterans, so that boosted up my achievement scores.

1273
01:20:29,502 --> 01:20:37,083
[SPEAKER_05]: But besides that, I'm just, you know, just trying to scrap as many games as possible since, you know, money's kind of tight right now.

1274
01:20:38,624 --> 01:20:42,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it hasn't been so bad.

1275
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:47,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the new unlock code for DDR, you know, for Supernova 2 came out, right?

1276
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I did hear something about that, that there's some new unlocks.

1277
01:20:50,486 --> 01:20:52,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about it since we didn't report on it tonight.

1278
01:20:52,146 --> 01:20:57,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's like I spent the better part of Friday and Dave and Buster's trying to do that shit and it...

1279
01:20:58,628 --> 01:20:59,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't able to.

1280
01:21:00,429 --> 01:21:02,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh, it has to be hooked up to the EMUs.

1281
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:04,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure?

1282
01:21:04,911 --> 01:21:05,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

1283
01:21:05,911 --> 01:21:07,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So, can't.

1284
01:21:07,952 --> 01:21:08,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?

1285
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:15,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that one actually was an unlock code in which you actually have to input certain, you have to hit certain arrows after you enter your credit.

1286
01:21:16,356 --> 01:21:19,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it had to be hooked up to the EMUs, if I remember correctly.

1287
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:20,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

1288
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:21,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

1289
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:24,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they have this kind of... Does it download the songs or something?

1290
01:21:25,577 --> 01:21:31,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's because there was some other competition thing that went along with some Zouken Battle 3 or 2 or something like that.

1291
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:31,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1292
01:21:32,419 --> 01:21:38,781
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I heard, other machines besides the one in Illinois, which is the only EMUs in the country, managed to get the code.

1293
01:21:39,281 --> 01:21:40,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Managed to get it working.

1294
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then your machine doesn't like you.

1295
01:21:43,082 --> 01:21:45,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it just has shitty pads, but that's besides the point.

1296
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just looking through...

1297
01:21:49,807 --> 01:21:51,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's just been a rough...

1298
01:21:52,603 --> 01:21:56,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I still try to load DDR Freak and look at the forums once in a while, just keep tabs on what's going on.

1299
01:21:56,667 --> 01:22:01,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any big tournaments or big things we ought to be looking forward to?

1300
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:01,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe...

1301
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:22,724
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Digital Life?

1302
01:22:22,825 --> 01:22:24,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually you're calling in Digital Life, Digital Life.

1303
01:22:24,827 --> 01:22:25,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that happening this year?

1304
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:28,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't been confirmed yet.

1305
01:22:28,553 --> 01:22:29,134
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.

1306
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Until I get confirmation, I'll let you know.

1307
01:22:32,358 --> 01:22:35,263
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, I'm not going to jump the gun quickly when...

1308
01:22:35,987 --> 01:22:38,310
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll tell you when we're ready, dang it.

1309
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:40,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're saying.

1310
01:22:40,393 --> 01:22:42,295
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll tell you when we're ready.

1311
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:53,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1312
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:53,730
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1313
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it.

1314
01:22:55,491 --> 01:22:58,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know once I hear word of it happening.

1315
01:22:58,551 --> 01:22:58,892
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1316
01:22:59,592 --> 01:23:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good, buddy.

1317
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:02,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we've got to wrap up and close the show.

1318
01:23:02,072 --> 01:23:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: You got any parting words for our listener tonight?

1319
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:05,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Listeners?

1320
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:08,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hack your PSP.

1321
01:23:08,594 --> 01:23:09,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Hack your PSP.

1322
01:23:10,234 --> 01:23:10,895
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, buddy.

1323
01:23:10,935 --> 01:23:11,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1324
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:16,490
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some great final words.

1325
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:17,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Hack your PSP.

1326
01:23:17,611 --> 01:23:18,192
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

1327
01:23:19,012 --> 01:23:20,754
[SPEAKER_00]: This naked gun thing is great.

1328
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:22,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check that out?

1329
01:23:22,535 --> 01:23:22,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

1330
01:23:22,976 --> 01:23:24,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to do some last minute stories.

1331
01:23:24,577 --> 01:23:25,778
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to start with Jamie tonight.

1332
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:54,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that he who shall not be named more news about him is that he's been well it's not that it's official yet but he's been recommended for a 10 year disbarment for his 27 misconduct charges also it should be noted that two of his Supreme Court cases were actually dismissed with prejudice meaning he can't file it again so I'm

1333
01:23:56,303 --> 01:23:59,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope the judge says yes and goes for the 10 years.

1334
01:24:00,424 --> 01:24:02,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is about he who shall not be named.

1335
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:13,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he was very... Oh, yeah, they wouldn't let him read his... Yeah, his long argument or whatever, which pretty much called everyone a dumbass and stuff like that.

1336
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:15,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Real class.

1337
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the judge didn't allow him to read.

1338
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:20,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had prepared it in advance, of course.

1339
01:24:20,131 --> 01:24:21,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, whatever, dude.

1340
01:24:22,172 --> 01:24:22,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

1341
01:24:25,365 --> 01:24:26,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to go through.

1342
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:28,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Prepared my speech on why I'm awesome.

1343
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to read it?

1344
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:32,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

1345
01:24:33,555 --> 01:24:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1346
01:24:34,947 --> 01:24:36,149
[SPEAKER_00]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1347
01:24:56,587 --> 01:24:58,207
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live Multiplayer and Feature 2-Person Online Co-op

1348
01:25:23,239 --> 01:25:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's all in GamePro's July issue which should be out soon.

1349
01:25:28,017 --> 01:25:34,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we were talking about movies earlier with Leonardo DiCaprio being in the Atari movie.

1350
01:25:34,123 --> 01:25:43,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now there's another movie being made, Kane and Lynch, with Bruce Willis going to be starring in it as Kane Marcus.

1351
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Adam Kane Marcus, I guess.

1352
01:25:46,393 --> 01:25:51,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is weird because Billy Bob Thornton apparently is in talks for the role of Lynch.

1353
01:25:51,918 --> 01:25:52,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like...

1354
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,141
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a classy movie.

1355
01:25:56,422 --> 01:25:56,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1356
01:25:56,742 --> 01:25:57,042
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1357
01:25:58,123 --> 01:26:06,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has apparently stopped production of a couple games that they were showing off, hell, I think before the PS3 even came out, including Eight Days and The Getaway.

1358
01:26:06,588 --> 01:26:12,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight Days, I believe, was that one that they showed the demo for, including all the bullets ripping up a car and that kind of stuff.

1359
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:15,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, not coming out I guess.

1360
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:27,019
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bioshock movie, which we talked about I believe last week, has been confirmed of course as part of the conference call following Take-Two's second quarter earnings.

1361
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:28,821
[SPEAKER_04]: They addressed the...

1362
01:26:30,282 --> 01:26:30,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1363
01:26:54,645 --> 01:27:00,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, I forgot to talk about this earlier, Rock Band, the download content for this coming week.

1364
01:27:00,907 --> 01:27:05,228
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the MTV 2-pack, which is going to feature... Crap.

1365
01:27:05,868 --> 01:27:06,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1366
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:08,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving to Seattle by The Material.

1367
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of them.

1368
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:11,610
[SPEAKER_04]: A Clean Shot by The Myriad.

1369
01:27:12,511 --> 01:27:15,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Bullets and Guns by Them Terribles.

1370
01:27:15,872 --> 01:27:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are each...

1371
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Available for 80 Microsoft Points or 240 points for the entire pack.

1372
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:29,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, an individual song, Girls Who Play Guitars by Maximo Park for also 80 points.

1373
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1374
01:27:32,062 --> 01:27:33,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it for Last Minute Stories?

1375
01:27:33,263 --> 01:27:33,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

1376
01:27:34,284 --> 01:27:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1377
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:36,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then that's going to wind down.

1378
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and to answer a question you had earlier.

1379
01:27:37,766 --> 01:27:38,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, wait a minute.

1380
01:27:38,307 --> 01:27:39,327
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, okay.

1381
01:27:39,347 --> 01:27:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, this is answering a question.

1382
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:40,909
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a story.

1383
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:41,269
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1384
01:27:41,869 --> 01:27:44,931
[SPEAKER_04]: One block equals 128 kilobytes.

1385
01:27:45,752 --> 01:27:51,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do the math there, I believe it's 500 blocks.

1386
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:51,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1387
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:52,137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1388
01:27:52,961 --> 01:27:55,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to wrap up the show now.

1389
01:27:55,363 --> 01:27:58,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Laundry.

1390
01:27:58,365 --> 01:28:00,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But not before we get everybody's final thought.

1391
01:28:01,687 --> 01:28:03,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I will start tonight with my final thought.

1392
01:28:03,388 --> 01:28:11,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is that these Haribo Happy Cola gummy candies that are like the little bottles of cola are like the yummiest things in the world.

1393
01:28:11,414 --> 01:28:12,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I love these things.

1394
01:28:12,835 --> 01:28:14,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're nonfat, which is awesome.

1395
01:28:14,316 --> 01:28:15,477
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1396
01:28:17,378 --> 01:28:18,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I want food.

1397
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:19,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Real food.

1398
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,501
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind you can eat and digest.

1399
01:28:21,521 --> 01:28:21,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1400
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

1401
01:28:24,597 --> 01:28:33,382
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, goddammit, I gotta get 100% on Grand Theft Auto 4.

1402
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:41,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to basically unlock the special ability of Paki.

1403
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:49,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, when you get your friendship up a certain percentage, he'll allow you to call him to give you cars with bombs in them.

1404
01:28:50,014 --> 01:28:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: and that will kick me over to 100% and I get the achievement and I'm done with the story.

1405
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:56,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Cars with bombs.

1406
01:28:56,818 --> 01:28:57,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1407
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:00,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1408
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,941
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1409
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:06,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys as always for tuning in to independent podcasting.

1410
01:29:06,403 --> 01:29:07,944
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

1411
01:29:07,984 --> 01:29:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: We do this pretty much for free and don't make any money off of it so we really appreciate you guys supporting us and keeping us the OLR family for almost six years now.

1412
01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:17,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very close to that.

1413
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:19,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you as always.

1414
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like what you've heard, all you have to do, help us spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio, independent podcasting in general because, you know, as independent podcasting grows, we all win.

1415
01:29:27,972 --> 01:29:37,694
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do, tell two friends about the show and they'll check it out and then hopefully tell two more friends and so on and so on until we spread all over the world, including Kenya, right?

1416
01:29:38,494 --> 01:29:39,095
[SPEAKER_00]: He is from Kenya.

1417
01:29:39,275 --> 01:29:39,535
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1418
01:29:40,335 --> 01:29:40,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm chatting with him.

1419
01:29:42,662 --> 01:29:45,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1420
01:29:45,826 --> 01:29:46,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much.

1421
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:54,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio for more debauchery and hopefully more reminiscing about better times.

1422
01:29:54,296 --> 01:29:54,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1423
01:29:55,397 --> 01:29:55,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1424
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:56,478
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you then.

1425
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,060
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1426
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:03,820
