Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,660
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June 29th, 2008, for part B of our podcast.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,920
Remember, Orange Lounge Radio tapes on Sunday nights live on All Games Radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,520
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at www.allgames.com

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,120
and then it releases in a podcast form twice a week for your entertainment.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,620
And tonight for your entertainment, Tommy Tallarico is going to be here on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live very shortly.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,760
But first, we're going to talk about some gaming news and I thought since we are going to be talking about music and video games,

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,400
how about some music news? Do you have some music game news for us, Loki, you could share?

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
Yes, I do actually.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Awesome.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
There's some pretty interesting stuff we've been kind of hoping for this to actually happen.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:16,000
But, apparently, a box shot of Samba de Amigo, a bundle with Meraka controller add-ons,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,500
Yes.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,900
has been seen at a UK retailer HMV's website.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,200
Now, I hope they aren't the cheapy-crappy little plastic snap-on things like you've seen for Wii Golf and Wii Tennis, right?

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,500
Like, they need to make the shaky Meraka noise.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,900
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch when you use them.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,400
It looks like that they have Meraka's on top of it.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,300
I don't know if they make the shaky noise, but I don't see why they wouldn't.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,700
If you're going to do Meraka controllers, do them right or don't do them at all, right?

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:47,500
And it's right now on there for 34.99 euros, which is about $70 US.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,100
And we always like to read comments from Chat, the ever-present fourth guest on our show, at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, live on Sunday.

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,900
And J-Rod says simply, Meraka's equals win.

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,100
Meraka's do equal win.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
What other games could be made better by Meraka's?

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,900
Dark Sakura, you think of anything?

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,500
Games that could be made better with Meraka's?

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,900
Um, um...

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,700
Soul Calibur? I don't know.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes, Meraka Calibur!

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,600
Because, remember, I did Rod Calibur.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Yeah, you can do Rod Calibur on the Dreamcast.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Simple to do Meraka Calibur.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,500
There you go.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,300
I've got Meraka's controllers.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Me too, on Dreamcast, believe it or not.

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,800
For Dreamcast.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,100
Let's try Meraka's Calibur.

43
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,900
Actually, any game can be played with the Meraka's.

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,100
Awesome.

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,600
If you think about it.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,800
3rd Bullet suggests Gears of Meraka's.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,500
Gears of Meraka's?

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,600
Miso suggests Cooking Mama is better with Meraka's.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,800
The only thing that's kind of weird about the Meraka controller, though, I noticed,

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,600
is that, um, where's the infrared gonna come out?

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Unless it goes all the way through the middle there.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,300
Because it looks like the top's covered by the Meraka's.

53
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,100
Who knows? Who knows?

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, one game that will not be made better by Meraka's is a game near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Launch Radio.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,700
It's Beat Mania 2DX.

56
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,100
You know, this series has been around forever.

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,900
A long, long time.

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,000
Like, I remember when we first started this show.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Probably, like, Sick Style was the hot new thing that was out on the block, I think, when this show started.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,100
I, I think so.

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,300
Believe it or not, this week was announced Beat Mania 2DX 16.

62
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,900
And, you know, ever since, uh, I wanna say Happy Sky or Red.

63
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,800
No, Red was the first one.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,500
Ever since, uh, 11th Style or Red, if you will.

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,400
Uh, they've been given sub names.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:38,200
And, uh, let's see, we had, what, 11 was Red, 12 was Happy Sky, 13 was, uh, Distorted, 14 was Gold, 15 was DJ Troopers.

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,400
Well, announced this week, Beat Mania 2DX 16 Empress.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,500
That is incredibly gay looking.

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,200
Yes, it is.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
Hey, wait a minute.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
No, it, it really is.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Uh, it's a pink Sailor Moon looking logo, uh, 2DX 16 Empress.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,200
There's a little butterfly hanging off the S, and it's pink.

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
It is very, very, very pink.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,700
So, you go from the manliness of DJ Troopers to the not-so-manliness of Empress.

76
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,600
But, you know what?

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,900
I think the game might still be a lot of fun.

78
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,100
And, uh, there's already, uh, apparently some song names coming out from the test locations.

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Apparently one song in Beat Mania 2DX 16 Empress, which, yes, is as pink as the, uh, little banner would have you thinking.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,500
This is all over the internet.

81
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Um, V2 is supposed to be in this game.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,200
A sequel to V by Taka.

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
One of the most hoarded songs in Beat Mania 2DX history.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
If you've ever walked by a Beat Mania or a DDR machine, you've probably read this one.

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,200
It actually is a V final from, um, that Taka album that came out.

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,700
Ahhh.

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,800
There you go.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
So, Beat Mania 2DX Empress location testing right now, which means it'll probably be out in Japan in a couple of months.

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,200
And you'll probably see the home version in Japan only, sadly, early next year because, uh, they tried to release Beat Mania here.

90
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,800
And, unfortunately, it didn't do too well because people thought it was a Guitar Hero ripoff.

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,700
Shame on Konami for sitting on what could have been a gold mine for far, far, far too long.

92
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, another potential, uh, gold mine, and this is one that was, uh, sent to us by the lovely and talented Sauce, is, uh, A Rumor of Guitar Hero Beatles Edition.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Which, actually, I think would be pretty cool.

94
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,300
Um...

95
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,800
That would be kinda neat.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,000
I think that more of the young whippersnappers need to hear some Beatles music.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Well, um, the, uh, Sony, um, ATV CEO, uh, Marty Bond, is it Bondier or Bondier, I guess, um, said that what they, they've actually talked about putting Beatles songs in a Guitar Hero game.

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,900
And something that you'd like to pursue, and that's a quote.

99
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,200
So...

100
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Maybe...

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
It could happen?

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wouldn't that be weird if Beatles were in Guitar Hero before they were on iTunes?

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Because, you know, that's, like, the big, uh, the big thing.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They never can be on iTunes, I think.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,300
I know, because of the whole Apple thing, but it's just kind of interesting, you know?

106
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,100
Like, eh, what's taking them so long to get on iTunes?

107
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,900
But, there you go.

108
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,800
And big, differing opinions in the chat room.

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,100
ThirdBullet says, I hate the Beatles.

110
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Uh, Misty says, Beatles...

111
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,900
You're getting booted from the chat room.

112
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,200
Misty says, Beatles, fuck yeah.

113
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,000
Watch me do it.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,100
This is not a democracy here at O.L.R.

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,700
This is a jameocracy.

116
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,800
Who is it, ThirdBullet?

117
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,700
I...

118
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,500
You don't have to ram.

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Alright.

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Jameocracy?

121
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Jameocracy?

122
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Jameocracy.

123
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah.

124
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Revolution!

125
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Off with her head!

126
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm just kidding.

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Alright.

128
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, um...

129
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I don't know if we're gonna...

130
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,200
Well, we'll probably be getting this before we'll see Beatles on any, uh, sort of system

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,600
for it, but, uh, Rockband is getting, um, I guess some tracks from Crewfest, which is

132
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,000
the, uh, Motley Crue tour, I guess.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,100
And, um, they've got a few tracks on here, including a free one.

134
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Um, part of the Crewfest pack, which is gonna be 240 Microsoft points, or $3, you've got

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
Down at the Whiskey by Motley Crue.

136
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,700
Um, you've got Time is Running Out by Papa Roach.

137
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,660
Uh, Who's Going Home with You Tonight by Trapped.

138
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:18,180
And also, uh, the free track, Promised Land by, um, looks like Vesuvius, I guess.

139
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,660
And that's supposedly coming from the new movie, The Rocker, which, uh, stars, uh, the

140
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,700
guy from, uh, The Office who plays Dwight.

141
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,300
Yes, I've seen those ads all over MySpace, and frankly, I'm sick of them.

142
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,580
Hey, free track!

143
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
It sucks!

144
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Who cares?

145
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,020
Free track is free, so, uh, hey, why not?

146
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,720
It's worth checking out.

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,020
Do you think, uh, free track's worth...

148
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,700
I mean, it's not like it's the Yaris theme song, so it can't be all bad, right?

149
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Let's hope.

150
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Alright.

151
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,620
Well, that's gonna do it for some of our video game news, uh, music edition for right now,

152
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
but hey, you know what?

153
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,900
Earlier this week, we had the fortune to speak with Tommy Tallarico.

154
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,420
You might remember him from his appearances on G4's Judgment Day, or you probably heard

155
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,100
his music in games like Earthworm Jim, Advent Rising.

156
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,580
Well, now Tommy is best known for his work with the Video Games Live concert series.

157
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,820
Recently, Video Games Live announced an expansive world tour, so we reached out to Tommy to

158
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,940
come on the show to talk about the upcoming tour, as well as respond to some of the recent

159
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,580
emails we've gotten about Video Games Live.

160
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,820
So let's head on over to the Skype line.

161
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,380
Alright, hey, Tommy, are you there?

162
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,660
Yo, I am here!

163
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,900
Hey, Tommy Tallarico, how are you doing this fine evening?

164
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm doing great, working as always.

165
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,040
You must be a very, very busy man traveling to all these new places on the Video Games

166
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Live tour.

167
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,540
Do you actually go to all the shows yourself?

168
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:42,060
Oh, yeah, every single show, aside from, uh, creating and, uh, producing the show every

169
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,580
night we also, um, I also host the show and even play guitar with the symphony towards

170
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
the end.

171
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,700
So you've got to be pretty exhausted, because not only are you balancing Video Games Live,

172
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,500
but Video Games Live isn't the only thing you do, either, so...

173
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,540
Yeah, yeah, I mean, aside from my, you know, still working on a few game, smaller game

174
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,180
projects here and there, because VGL definitely takes up most of, uh, 95% of my time, but,

175
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:12,140
uh, working on a couple DS and Wii and PC products, as well as also the, uh, the Chairman

176
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,540
of the, um, the Game Audio Network Guild.

177
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
Excellent.

178
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,460
I definitely want to ask you about the Game Audio Network Guild, but I know the listeners

179
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,540
want to hear about Video Games Live, absolutely, because we've gotten, you know, emails and

180
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,620
calls about it.

181
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,580
Let me ask you this about Video Games Live.

182
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,460
You're going to so many new places on this, you know, 50-date city tour you just announced.

183
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,300
What can someone who has never been to Video Games Live before expect to experience?

184
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,140
Yeah, well, Video Games Live is all the greatest video game music of all time, played by a

185
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,300
full symphony and choir, but what makes it really unique is that everyb- everything is

186
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,340
completely synchronized with, uh, video and rock and roll lighting and special effects

187
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,540
and interactivity with the crowd and stage show production and we have a whole pre-show

188
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:07,420
festival with gaming competitions and prize giveaways and costume contests and a post-show

189
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,300
meet and greet, which is open for everyone with peo- different people in the industry

190
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,320
and famous composers and designers and things like that.

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,460
So it really is a complete celebration of the entire video game industry.

192
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,180
In fact, I kind of like to describe it as all of the power and emotion of a symphony

193
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,620
orchestra combined with the excitement and energy of a rock concert mixed together with

194
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,780
all of the cutting edge visuals, technology, interactivity, and fun that video games provide.

195
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,060
It's kind of like, the way you describe it, it's almost like a traveling convention of

196
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
sorts.

197
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,900
There's so much to see at these shows.

198
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,940
Yeah, I mean, we really wanted to create an event, you know?

199
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,300
We didn't want to create, you know, we wanted to create a show.

200
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,900
We didn't want to just create a concert or, you know, oh yeah, here's a bunch of classical

201
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,460
people in tuxedos up on a stage playing video game music.

202
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,180
I mean, you know, and that's great as well, but, you know, people have been doing that,

203
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,980
they've been doing that in Japan for almost 20 years now, so, you know, we wanted to do

204
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,020
something completely new, completely unique, and really, our goal from the beginning was

205
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,540
to create this show for the non-gamer as well.

206
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,160
You know, we wanted to create something that was, had mass appeal, and that you don't have

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,040
to know a darn thing at all about video games in order to come to the show and really be

208
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,140
blown away and entertained, and that's why Video Games Live has grown, you know, so quickly

209
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,300
and as big as it has.

210
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:48,100
We did three shows in 2005, 11 shows in 2006, 29 last year in 2007.

211
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,320
This year we have over 50 shows, next year we have over 80 shows, and the goal is to

212
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,540
build it by 2010 up to 100 and to 120 shows a year.

213
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:06,100
So yeah, you know, so by having all these visuals, by creating a performance and a production

214
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:14,660
and an event and a show, it clearly crosses over and has much more mass appeal than just,

215
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:22,380
you know, a hardcore gaming concert that, you know, that all the Final Fantasy fans

216
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,100
go to or all the, you know, whatever particular items.

217
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,940
We want to appeal to everybody, whether you're into video games or not, and again, that's

218
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,480
not to downplay what all of the amazing concerts in the past have done and continue to do,

219
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,700
but ours is a little different.

220
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,500
Let me go off of that a little bit because you talk about making this concert accessible

221
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,220
to even those that are non-gamers, and I know we have a lot of listeners that are a little

222
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,500
bit younger, 15, 16, 17, it's a little harder for them to just kind of get up and go get

223
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
a concert ticket.

224
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,260
What would you say would be the best way to sell a night at Video Games Live to my parents?

225
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,740
Yeah, oh, absolutely.

226
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,040
Well, I mean, of course there's a website, videogameslive.com, and we have a bunch of

227
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,460
trailers on there, and you'll see parents in their 40s and 50s, you'll see grandmas

228
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,620
in their 60s and 70s, you'll see little girls, 7, 8, 9 years old, all saying, oh my gosh,

229
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,980
this was the greatest night of my life, you know, oh my gosh, I've never seen a show quite

230
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,820
like this before, I was really blown away.

231
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,880
I came here because, you know, I was dragged here by my boyfriend or the grandmother saying

232
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,060
I was taking my grandson to the symphony for the first time, and those are the people most

233
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:42,660
blown away by the production because they're astonished at the quality of music.

234
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,180
You know, again, the reason why I created this in the beginning was to prove to the

235
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:54,020
world how culturally significant and artistic video games, and of course their music, have

236
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
become.

237
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,020
And so the best letters and emails that we get after a performance, they come pouring

238
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,460
in, they're all from non-gamers, they're all from the people who are blown away going,

239
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,620
oh my gosh, I never knew that video games were this incredible and the music was so

240
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,780
powerful and the characters and the storylines were so interesting and intense and the graphics

241
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:24,060
are so beautiful, I get it now, now I understand why my kids are so much into video games.

242
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,780
Thank you for opening my eyes.

243
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,540
So a lot of times, you know, on the website, we'll put in these comments and we'll put

244
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,060
in, we show all of the reviews that we've gotten for the show and all of the comments

245
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,220
and letters from people and non-gamers, and in those reviews, they all kind of follow

246
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,580
the same thing going, well, you know what, I wasn't into video games, I didn't know what

247
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,900
to expect, but wow, you know.

248
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,780
So it's word of mouth that really is the, I kind of compare us a little bit in that

249
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,180
respect to Cirque du Soleil, in that, you know, the first time people had heard of Cirque

250
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,540
du Soleil, I know I was one of them, I was kind of like, what the hell is it?

251
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,380
Is it circus animals running around, clowns?

252
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
I don't get it.

253
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,740
You know, it was only until you saw it with your own two eyes or somebody really close

254
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,020
to you explained it in great detail where you start to go, oh, I get it, you know.

255
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,100
So I mean, yeah, you could watch the 1,500 plus YouTube videos that are on there right

256
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
now.

257
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,060
You do a search for video games live and they'll all come up, but, you know, a lot of people

258
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,300
always tell us, you know, I watched all the YouTube videos, but until you're there, until

259
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:36,540
you're experiencing that magic of being in a room with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 people all

260
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,940
experiencing it at once, there's, you know, there's some magic that it goes on, you know.

261
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,940
YouTube is never a substitution for anything like this.

262
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,940
Absolutely.

263
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, whatever you guys are doing, however the word is getting out there, obviously it's

264
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
working.

265
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,820
Video games live, it's coming up on a three-year anniversary pretty soon, if I'm not mistaken.

266
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,260
But based on what you're saying, you know, ramping up to 120 shows in 2010, it's not

267
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,860
slowing down anytime soon.

268
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,540
What would you say, Tommy, is the biggest accomplishment, the biggest thing you've accomplished

269
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,780
from video games live in its three-year history so far?

270
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:18,180
Well, you know, I think that I had a dream, myself and my fellow video game composer Jack

271
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,000
Wall who also conducts video games live and we kind of, you know, created the show together.

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,520
It took us three years to create the show and in the beginning, we started this in 2002

273
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,640
and everyone thought we were completely insane and completely crazy.

274
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:44,940
So I would say that our biggest accomplishment is, you know, is getting this thing up and

275
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,860
running to the point where, you know, I mean, I could point to certain singular things that

276
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,580
happened like, for example, our first show ever was at the Hollywood Bowl on July 6,

277
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,100
2005 with the L.A. Phil.

278
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,700
Over 11,000 people showed up to that show.

279
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,960
People thought, you know, two or three thousand people were going to show up or whatever.

280
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:13,980
So I mean, you know, I mean, what an accomplishment to say that we, our first show ever with that

281
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,780
quite arguably the most famous stage in the entire planet, you know?

282
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
And there's other things.

283
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,500
I mean, you know, we were the first to play in Canada, the first American concert to play

284
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,540
in Asia, the first to play in Brazil and places like Spain and London, England and, you know,

285
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,540
I mean, there's New Zealand, things like that.

286
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,300
I mean, I could point to a lot of those things, but I just think the idea that this is, you

287
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,420
know, surviving and growing at the rate it is, I think when everyone in the beginning

288
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,200
told us we were insane and crazy and it would never work, you know, that's the greatest

289
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,780
accomplishment for us.

290
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,700
And kind of building on that, because you talk, you've talked about all these places

291
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,980
you've been and that you're the kind of the first video game concert in Canada and the

292
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,780
first concert in Asia and things kind of keep growing.

293
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,740
I mean, through these latest tour dates, you guys are going to Germany, China, Thailand,

294
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Portugal.

295
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,100
I mean, your passport is probably very impressive.

296
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,700
I got to wonder, how do you select the places that you're going to go?

297
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,660
How do you decide we're going to do this in Asia or we're going to go to Portugal?

298
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,760
How do you pick where you're going?

299
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
That's a great question.

300
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,460
A number of different ways, actually.

301
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,020
We've now grown to a point where people are now, you know, knocking our doors down trying

302
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
to get us.

303
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:42,420
So, you know, the people in China contacted us and we're going to do, we're doing Beijing

304
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,300
and Hong Kong, multiple dates.

305
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,260
You know, the people from Singapore contacted us, you know.

306
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
It's a great thing.

307
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,200
In terms of all the places in the United States, you know, we had a really important show at

308
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,420
the end of April where it was our debut on Broadway in New York City, you know, and a

309
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,460
very important thing for any act or performance.

310
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,460
And we sold out the show three months in advance.

311
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,740
And so that was a huge accomplishment.

312
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:15,060
What that does is that sends messages to all of the other promoters and cities and symphonies

313
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,580
and buyers of this material.

314
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,380
It sends out a strong message.

315
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
And so they start knocking down our doors.

316
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,120
So at this point for us, all we're trying to do is, you know, kind of take all of these

317
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,100
things and put them in at some kind, make some kind of sensible routing or sensible

318
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,540
order and, you know, figuring out, okay, which ones do we pick?

319
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,380
Like for example, if the San Diego Symphony contacts us, oh, hey, let's do it during Comic-Con

320
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,580
in San Diego.

321
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,380
You know, the German promoters contact us, well, geez, let's do it during Leipzig Game

322
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Convention.

323
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,780
Indianapolis Symphony, let's do it during Gen Con.

324
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:58,020
So we always try to, you know, work in maybe around some kind of conference.

325
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,620
But I'll tell you an interesting story, though.

326
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,860
I got an email from a 17-year-old girl in Taipei, Taiwan.

327
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:14,380
And she wrote me and said, hey, I would like to get a petition going to bring video games

328
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
live to Taiwan.

329
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,580
It would be the very first video game concert ever in Taiwan.

330
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,500
And she asked if she could use our logo and things to start a petition.

331
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,860
And she wanted to make up flyers and pass them on.

332
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
I said, sure, absolutely.

333
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,820
And I thought it was kind of cool and adorable, you know.

334
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:42,940
But two weeks later, she contacts me, and she has an Excel spreadsheet and a link that

335
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,480
I could follow.

336
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
And she says, hey, look, been working really hard.

337
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,340
We have over 2800 people who have signed up, signed the petition.

338
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,300
Here's all their email addresses.

339
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,180
Here's the link and all the comments that they've left back.

340
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,360
And I'm like, how the heck do people know about video games live in Taiwan?

341
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
And she says, oh, through YouTube.

342
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,100
We all get together and watch it.

343
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,580
It's kind of this underground community thing where they check your show dates.

344
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,380
And then the day after the show, people watch all the videos that people post on YouTube.

345
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,020
And they feel like they're part of the event.

346
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,060
So I pass this information on to one of our booking agents in Asia.

347
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,900
And within two weeks, we got a big promoter.

348
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,740
Because of this girl, we were doing two shows in Taipei now.

349
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,820
That's the cool thing about video games, though, if you think about it, and video game music

350
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,660
specifically, is that you could go, and we've hopefully proven this, you can go anywhere

351
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,260
in the world.

352
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,820
And video games are popular.

353
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
You know?

354
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,220
I mean, think about that for a second.

355
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,580
There's not a lot of music out there that you can say the same thing.

356
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,460
Like, for example, the Dave Matthews bands might be super popular in America.

357
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,840
They might sell out 20,000 seat stadiums.

358
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,060
But when they go to Germany, maybe not so much.

359
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,940
Or when they go to Spain, no one knows who they are.

360
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,620
Or Korea, no one's heard of them, right?

361
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,220
And the reverse is true.

362
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,980
European bands try to break you here all the time, and people have no idea who they are.

363
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,300
They just never really catch on.

364
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Exactly.

365
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,340
And the same with Japan as well.

366
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,020
Whereas video games, music.

367
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,540
What a universal thing.

368
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:33,300
Now, although the game popularity might change from region to region, like in the US here,

369
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,140
we might play Halo as our big grand finale.

370
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,500
But maybe down in Brazil, where the PlayStation is a lot more predominant, and not so many

371
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,780
Xboxes, maybe a game like Castlevania or Nintendo is big down there as well.

372
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,780
So maybe it's Mario or Castlevania down in Brazil, you know?

373
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,100
And so it's really been a learning experience and an eye-opener for me.

374
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,820
To take Brazil, for example, is a great example.

375
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
We went down there.

376
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,940
We had three weeks of sold-out shows.

377
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,620
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and Brasília, which is the capital.

378
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,260
And they, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people a night, screaming at the top of their lungs, you know,

379
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,900
so much so that our front-of-house mixer couldn't even hear the symphony when he was trying

380
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
to mix it.

381
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,100
It's like, I hope this sounds good.

382
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,620
I mean, the passion down there for stuff like this is off the charts.

383
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,900
But you never hear about gamers in Brazil over here.

384
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Why?

385
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,040
Because, and you never see Brazil at the top of any, you know, marketing lists or lists

386
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,700
about how many gamers there are in Brazil and this and that.

387
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Why?

388
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,240
Because it's all black market down there.

389
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,700
You know, 99% of all the games that are sold, companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft

390
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,980
and EA and Activision, they don't even distribute games down there because it's all, or hardware,

391
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,860
because it's all black market.

392
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,220
But because it's so easily accessible and because it's so cheap, there's more hardcore

393
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,880
gamers down there than I've seen and experienced in other parts of the world, you know.

394
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,940
And even, like, down in Mexico, we played a smaller town in Mexico a couple months ago.

395
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,580
It was at the end of March.

396
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,820
We played a 7,000 seat bull ring in Mexico, Mexicali, Mexico.

397
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,420
It wasn't Mexico City, which is the biggest city in the world, which people may not, 30

398
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,620
million people.

399
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
And same with Brazil.

400
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,700
We play Sao Paulo.

401
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,460
It's the second or third biggest city in the world, like 28 million people.

402
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,220
But even in a smaller town like Mexicali, Mexico, which I think has a million people,

403
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,980
you know, there were 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 gamers who showed up.

404
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,860
You know, it's funny, Tommy.

405
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,740
One of those people that were there at that concert in Mexicali actually called us that

406
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
next weekend.

407
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
Oh, really?

408
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Yes.

409
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,180
He's one of our listeners at Deft and he said he had a great time at the show, can't wait

410
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,260
to go back.

411
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,260
And that was kind of leading to my next question, which I think you might have already answered,

412
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,740
talking about the girl from Taipei.

413
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,260
But if there's somebody who wants this event to come to their city or come back to their

414
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,220
city, what do you think is the best way for them to kind of go about doing this?

415
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,500
I mean, I don't know if you want to get a partition from every city, but what do you

416
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,220
think would be the best way for somebody to get this back to their town?

417
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,100
We actually put this in the FAQ on our website as well because we get asked that same question

418
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,900
by so many people.

419
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,980
And the other question that's asked a lot is, how do you pick which music to play for

420
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,540
different cities or countries that you go to?

421
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,360
So it's really a two-part answer.

422
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,500
The first question is, we have a mailing list on the front page, it's Video Games Live mailing

423
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
list.

424
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,020
We don't spam people, we send out something maybe once every couple of months, or if it's

425
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:56,260
coming to your area, we'll geo-target your area to let you know that pre-sale tickets

426
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,340
are going on so that Video Games Live folks can get them before the general public does.

427
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,420
But on that, there's a thing that says, let us know what games you want to hear.

428
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,020
And what we do is we take that list and it spits out an Excel spreadsheet for us for

429
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,140
that area.

430
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:20,040
So I can geo-target a 200-mile radius around the city that we're going to, and it will

431
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,500
show me, out of all the people who signed up for the mailing list, what they want to

432
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
hear most.

433
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,780
So each show we do, we have our standards, if you will.

434
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,980
Every show, we're going to play your Final Fantasy and Halo and Warcraft and Mario and

435
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,660
Zelda and Kingdom Hearts and Sonic and all that stuff.

436
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,880
There's certain games we like to play every single show, although we change them from

437
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,100
year to year.

438
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,180
But then when you start to replay about 20 segments in an evening, that constitutes about

439
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,560
a two-and-a-half hour presentation.

440
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:04,660
So one night, if we're in France, for example, and the game Beyond Good and Evil was created

441
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,620
by my good friend Michel Ancel at Ubisoft in France, we're going to play Beyond Good

442
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
and Evil.

443
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,100
And in fact, or we'll play it like we played in Montreal in February, because that's the

444
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,980
North American home office of Ubisoft.

445
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,660
We played Ubisoft games and had some of the creators there.

446
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,500
It will last, this past weekend we were in Las Vegas, so we did the world premiere of

447
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,180
Command and Conquer, because the game was made right there.

448
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:43,420
So, yeah, we have, in Asia, stuff like Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 2 hasn't even come out, but

449
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,180
we're already playing the music and the video.

450
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:53,660
Games like Warcraft and Starcraft are super huge over in Asia, but not so much down in

451
00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:00,340
Brazil because a lot of people are less about PC gaming and more about Nintendo and Sony.

452
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,580
So down in Brazil, stuff like Metroid and Castlevania is huge down there.

453
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:13,660
So we vary, but we really listen to the fans from that area to decide, and if people want

454
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:20,260
to bring our show to their city, we also have an email address, info at video games live

455
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:27,060
dot com, and we collect all those emails and normally someone will get back to you within

456
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
24 hours.

457
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,460
Excellent, I hope not only act deaf, but all of our listeners who are hoping to get video

458
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,500
games live in their backyard are successful with that.

459
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,140
Speaking of listeners going to the show, I have to bring this up.

460
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,540
This might be a little silly, but I got to ask it, it's kind of funny.

461
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,180
One of our listeners, DJ Jenai, wrote us on a previous show and he was talking about the

462
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,900
video games live tour stop in Las Vegas, raved about the show, said he had a great time,

463
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,660
but one part that kind of cracked me up is he specifically mentioned that you change

464
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,940
outfits quite a bit during the show.

465
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,380
Are you coordinating your wardrobe to match the games?

466
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,620
I'll tell you exactly, and I'll explain it, and again it's a great question.

467
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,180
I'm Cher up in this motherfucker, no, I'm like Cher, I got to change everything, Madonna,

468
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:18,220
Britney, no, there's three times, I have two and a half hour performance, I host the show

469
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,220
of course, as I mentioned, and I want to be respectful to the symphony and the people

470
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,340
on stage, but by the same token I'm also, you know, I've been a video game composer

471
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:36,560
for 18 years, so I might come out in an Armani suit, but I might be wearing, you know, Nike

472
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,420
sneakers and a Spiderman shirt underneath, or a Mickey Mouse shirt underneath, or whatever,

473
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:50,420
so I don't know what you'd call it, casual, whatever, I don't know, casual talks or something,

474
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
I don't know.

475
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,740
But at the beginning I, you know, kind of do that, and then we have a 20 minute intermission,

476
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:05,300
and I come back and now the shirt's on buttons, the, you know, the coat tails might be off,

477
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:12,500
we're going to turn on the lights a little bit for this segment, and then at the end

478
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,500
I come out with a guitar, and it would look silly of me to be wearing a suit and playing

479
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:24,380
guitar, so by the encore I'm kind of in, you know, a little bit more rock and roll gear,

480
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:30,180
if you will, and so yeah, so I changed three times, once at the beginning to be kind of

481
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,460
more formal, and then it kind of evolves into not so formal.

482
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,260
Alright, well that makes sense, thank you for helping to explain that, alright, it was

483
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,260
a very important question about Video Games Live.

484
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
No worries, no worries.

485
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Alright, no, this really is an important question about Video Games Live, a lot of people are

486
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,100
wondering, is there a CD at some point in the future, or some type of digital distribution,

487
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,220
iTunes, question mark?

488
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:58,060
Absolutely, in fact it's something that was supposed to come out last fall, and then we

489
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,500
held, we kind of, the record company made the decision that they didn't want it to come

490
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,940
out during Christmas, because, you know, Christmas season, because they didn't want it to get

491
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,260
lost and all the, you know, the great games that always come out around that time, so

492
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,700
then we, we're going to delay it to the first quarter of this year, you know, we're thinking,

493
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,500
oh, maybe come out like around, you know, February or March instead, after all the Christmas

494
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:30,340
hype had subsided, but then we're working on some new great pieces, at the time I was

495
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,500
working on, because a lot of people also, they email us to say, or they'll all talk

496
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,240
to people after the show during the meet and greet, and I always ask, hey, how can we improve

497
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,260
the show, is there something that you want to hear that we don't play in the show, and

498
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I was getting just bombarded by like, you know, Metroid and Castlevania, which we hadn't,

499
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,300
you know, we had done an orchestral version of Castlevania, but I was never happy with

500
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,740
it, because I think, you know, Castlevania music needs to really be like a combination

501
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,100
of symphony and rock and roll, that's how I wanted to present it in my mind, and so

502
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,380
I was working on this Castlevania thing, and I was just like, man, I really want to, I

503
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:19,300
want to get this on the album, so I asked, you know, I asked EMI, who's one of the biggest

504
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,180
record companies in the world who's putting the album out, you know, I kind of begged

505
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,940
and pleaded to say, hey, could we, you know, could we delay this again and add a couple

506
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,980
more tracks to the album that I think will be really special to gamers, you know, including

507
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:39,020
this, you know, this Castlevania piece, and they said, yeah, no problem, sure, you know,

508
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:45,220
so the album is officially going to be released in physical form around the world, too, not

509
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,140
just in America, not just on iTunes, I'm talking about all over Europe, all over Asia, it's

510
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:58,580
the first time ever that a video game compilation album is being released by a major record

511
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,020
company around the world, it's never happened before, and the licensing, if you can imagine

512
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:10,820
the licensing, you know, going through companies like Halo, I mean, Microsoft for Halo, and

513
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,220
Ubisoft for Myst, and, you know, Konami for Castlevania, I mean, it got to be, you know,

514
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,040
it was a bit of a nightmare at first, because no one had ever really done anything like

515
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,500
this before, same thing we encountered, that's why it took us three years to get the first

516
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,300
concert in order, because no one had ever done it to the scale and size that we were

517
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:35,580
doing, but, so, it's going to be released all over the world, July 22nd is the release

518
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:41,380
date here in America, which we're coinciding, and another reason we wanted to delay it is

519
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:48,560
because we wanted to, we wanted to launch it at a special, for different special events,

520
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,620
so for example, the reason it's being released in July, that's the week of Comic Con, and

521
00:33:53,620 --> 00:34:00,060
we're opening Comic Con with the San Diego Symphony, right there on the grounds of Comic

522
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:06,260
Con, right next, at the Embarcadero, on the water, outside shows, San Diego Symphony,

523
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,540
so many special guests, but we're also having synchronized fireworks as well for that show,

524
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,100
and so this is all in celebration as well of our album being released that week, so

525
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,900
we wanted to wait for something big, and that was the one.

526
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:28,220
In terms of our European release, we're going to do that, we're playing a 7,000 seat stadium

527
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:34,700
in Leipzig, it's the Leipzig Arena, right there during the Games Convention in August,

528
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,380
so we're going to wait to release the album in August in Europe, you know, have it be

529
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:45,140
around a big press and marketing event and things like that, and then in Asia, we're

530
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,500
going to be releasing it right around the time of the Olympics, where we're playing

531
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,980
in Taipei in the beginning of August, and that's when we're going to do the big release

532
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,860
there, the very first video game concert ever in those countries, China and Taiwan, so,

533
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:06,700
but that being said, it's also going to be available for download on iTunes before the

534
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:13,320
physical release comes out, and it's also going to have special content and special

535
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,960
songs that are not on the physical CD as a kind of a special bonus.

536
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,820
Very cool, and you know, we here at OLR, I think we can all agree we're very comfortable

537
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,820
with you delaying the CD to incorporate Castlevania, because that game is incredible, and the music

538
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,740
is awesome, so we're fine.

539
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:41,180
It's like when Miyamoto, I worked with Miyamoto on Metroid Prime, and I've known him for many

540
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:48,240
years, he's such a great guy, and he once told me, you know, when I said, well how do

541
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,620
you know when the game is done, you know, like do you have a schedule, he says, you

542
00:35:53,620 --> 00:36:02,400
know, the game is released when I'm finished with it, you know, and that's why Halo 2 gets

543
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,140
delayed a couple years, Zelda gets delayed a couple years, Half Life 2 comes out two

544
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:14,520
years, three years later, whatever it is, but you know what, don't you wish all game

545
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,960
companies and game makers and game developers had that same sense about it.

546
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,840
Why is Halo Halo, and Half Life Half Life, and why any Miyamoto product is what it is,

547
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,980
it's because they refuse to let anything out that's not perfect, you know, or the best

548
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,900
it could possibly be at that time.

549
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,360
We feel the same way, we don't want to just rush out an album, we were making Castlevania,

550
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,440
it's like, man, I gotta get this on, it's a really popular track that we love to perform.

551
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,200
And you're absolutely right, in gaming, you know, a lot of people get very frustrated

552
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,600
with these delays sometimes, but you know what, sometimes it's for a good reason.

553
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,040
So you know the funny thing about that too is that you'll notice like people will bitch

554
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,920
and moan like crazy when it keeps getting delayed, and then the second those games come

555
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,760
out, I worked on Metroid Prime, I think we were working on it for five freaking years

556
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,560
or something, with Miyamoto, right?

557
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,200
But the thing you'll notice though is when the game comes out, and it's freaking perfect,

558
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,400
you never hear any complaints ever again about it being delayed, right?

559
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,560
It's very true, everybody seems to forget, everyone seems to forget the second the day

560
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
comes out.

561
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,400
Well Tommy, I know it might be a little late for requests for Video Games Live CD Volume

562
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,280
1, but seeing as this thing's going into 2010, I think a Volume 2 is going to be an inevitability

563
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
at some point.

564
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,740
A Silent Hill, keep that in mind.

565
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,680
We love Silent Hill here at OLR.

566
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:47,280
Akira is a very good friend of mine, he's joined us on stage a few times, most recently

567
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,360
in Los Angeles last year during the E4ALL Expo, and we did a big show there, 5,000 people

568
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:04,760
where we opened the Nokia, it's called, LA Live is the area, but the Nokia Center.

569
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,720
I remember that Tommy, I was in LA, and I wanted to go to the show, I was stuck doing

570
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
work, I couldn't do it.

571
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
I was so mad.

572
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,160
Well you could have met Akira right there, if you like Silent Hill, he was part of our

573
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,420
meet and greet as well.

574
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,680
Not only Akira, I had him on stage, I also had the creator of Dance Dance Revolution,

575
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,360
and also the dude who created Castlevania as well, Iga, was also part of the meet and

576
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,400
greet there as well.

577
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,560
But yes, Silent Hill, get a little, what do you think, in Laura's theme?

578
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,400
Maybe just the theme from the very first game, that really haunting little melody in the

579
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,320
beginning, and the kind of like, upbeat as it goes through, just the classic, or, I don't

580
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,220
know, I'm kind of partial to the soundtrack for Silent Hill 4, I don't know what my co-host

581
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,160
would say about that, I think they're all about Silent Hill 2, but...

582
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,880
You know the tough part, it's something to think about too, from my end, is that, like

583
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,740
the music from Silent Hill is a perfect example, where certain games, it's very hard to translate

584
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,960
to a live performance, especially when you're talking about a symphony on stage, Silent

585
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,000
Hill is one of those games, you know?

586
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,920
I'll tell you, the other game that was very, very challenging, and I didn't want to put

587
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,040
it in the show until I figured it out, was Metroid, right?

588
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,480
Because everyone loves Metroid, and we were getting so many requests for it, but it's

589
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,720
like, how do you do Metroid with a symphony, you know?

590
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,560
And so what we, I mean I don't want to spoil it, but people can check it out on YouTube

591
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,500
or whatever anyway, but what we did with Metroid is we decided to, let's try to create that

592
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,880
beginning, that everyone knows and loves so much, let's try to kind of recreate those

593
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:52,840
electronics and bleeps and bloops with the symphony, you know, and add in the electronics,

594
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,100
add in the original sounds from the game, and play those live with the symphony as well,

595
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,360
to kind of give it this really super-duper retro feel, because if you try to just do

596
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,960
it with instruments, it sometimes doesn't translate, you know, so we're really happy

597
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,240
with the way the Metroid segment turned out, and it's been a really popular segment for

598
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
us.

599
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Excellent.

600
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Excellent.

601
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,960
I can't wait to see it myself, hopefully in San Jose.

602
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,840
One thing, I want to kind of ask you about some of the other stuff outside of Video Games

603
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,920
Live, I know we're kind of longer than we anticipated in the beginning, that's alright,

604
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,400
we're having a good time, I wanted to ask you about some of your other stuff besides

605
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,480
just Video Games Live, let me take another listener question here.

606
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,720
One of our listeners, Dark Tetsuya, wanted to know, do you have a favorite piece that

607
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,760
you've ever worked on for the video game music that you've composed?

608
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,040
Sure, yeah.

609
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,320
There's actually two, I'm going to go with two, actually.

610
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:53,920
The stuff that I did for Earthworm Jim is some of my favorite stuff, and more so, not

611
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,800
necessarily even from a composing standpoint, but from a, just a silliness standpoint in

612
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,080
terms of like, when we were working on Earthworm Jim, there was like ten guys in a room, all

613
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,040
trying to make each other laugh.

614
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,960
That was Video, or that was Earthworm Jim, that's what we did, we had a year to make

615
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
each other laugh.

616
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,080
And you totally can't tell from the way it turned out.

617
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,960
Yeah, right?

618
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,920
And so, you know, that was such a great experience, and just doing it so, so differently, of course

619
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,000
that team had been together for a long time, we worked on the original Terminator game,

620
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,760
we did Global Gladiators for the Genesis, then we did Cool Spot, then we did Disney's

621
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,680
Aladdin, and then we did Earthworm Jim 1 and 2, and then MDK after that, before everyone

622
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,760
kind of started their own companies, but that was such a great experience, so I would say

623
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,320
if I had a personal favorite, that would be it.

624
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,980
But in terms of composition, though, I feel as a composer that the favorite stuff that

625
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:03,600
I've composed is probably Advent Rising, and some of the music in there, because I've always

626
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,100
wanted to write like an Italian opera, and so when Advent Rising came across, and it's

627
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:18,400
too bad that the game didn't do well at all, and it's a shame, but I was really happy with

628
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,560
the way the music composition turned out in that, and it was something I've always wanted

629
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,000
to do my whole life, and so I really put my heart and soul into that score.

630
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,960
Well, hopefully people will get a second chance to check that out if it ever makes its way

631
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
to the Xbox originals.

632
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Yeah, there you go.

633
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,400
All right, well, one other thing I want to ask you about, we mentioned kind of towards

634
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,780
the beginning of the interview, you also, you know, not just do this Video Games Live,

635
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,720
you also are the chairman of Game Audio Network Guild, or GANG, it's like a network of people

636
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,520
basically involved with gaming music, voiceovers, sound designers, what's GANG up to this year?

637
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
What is GANG doing this year?

638
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,440
Well, the biggest thing, the biggest thing that GANG has just done, last week in fact,

639
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:06,280
was launch version 3.0 of our website, which is a complete networking mass, I mean it really,

640
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:12,360
you know, the third word in GANG, network, right, the Game Audio Network Guild, this

641
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,000
was always our dream to have this kind of portal and website available, I mean think

642
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,760
of like, you know, Myspace meets, you know, the Game Developers Association, you know,

643
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:35,280
the IGDA or, you know, gamasutra.com, right, those great websites out there, so, I mean,

644
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,960
you know, networking is so important in our industry where, you know, so much so that

645
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,160
I always, when I talk to people about, you know, people trying to get in the industry

646
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,200
or give speeches at schools or whatever, is that I always say that, you know, the creative

647
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:58,600
aspect of what you do is only about 50% of it, the other 50% is networking, so instead

648
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,520
of, you know, and I say that to any, you know, musician, instead of practicing piano for

649
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,640
ten hours a day, if you practice that for five hours a day and then you take the other

650
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,320
five hours and use that to network and to get to know people and to send emails or to,

651
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,760
you know, help better yourself or your personality or, you know, whatever, so, you know, people

652
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,960
have to, you know, I think one thing that I've learned is that it, you don't necessarily,

653
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,600
it's not all about talent, you know, it's about 50-50, so, you know, gang launching

654
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:42,680
this new website is really, you know, we have over 2,500 members in over 30 countries around

655
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,720
the world, we have scholarship programs for people looking to get in the industry, we

656
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:55,000
focus not only on the creative aspects of video game audio but also the technical aspects

657
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,840
and the business aspects as well because that's also very, very important and those three

658
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:06,240
things are key to being, you know, successful in the game audio industry but, you know,

659
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,000
there's apprenticeships and mentorships and, you know, for people looking to get in as

660
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,240
well, so that's our biggest thing is launching this new site, we're always working with schools

661
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,120
and universities all over the world on creating game audio curriculums for colleges and universities

662
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,480
and, by the way, some of these colleges and universities are places like Berklee School

663
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,960
of Music in Boston, places like UCLA and USC, I mean, some of the finest schools in the

664
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,240
world and even some specialized colleges, accredited colleges, you know, places like

665
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,960
Full Sail in Florida, for example, or Guildhall in Texas or Expressions in San Francisco,

666
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,600
so, you know, working, it's been a passion of mine from the beginning to really, you

667
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:03,240
know, help the game audio industry have more respect and to educate not only each other

668
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,120
as composers and sound designers but also to educate the developers and the publishers

669
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:13,640
as well because when I first got in this industry almost 20 years ago, they didn't care, they

670
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,080
didn't give a crap about video game audio, you know, it was so like, you know, I mean,

671
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:24,320
a typical day in the office, you know, back in the early 90s would be somebody walking

672
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,880
in my office saying, okay, the game's done, we don't have any music, we don't have any

673
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,040
money or budget, we don't have any space left on the cartridge and, oh, yeah, we got to

674
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,880
submit this in two days so we don't have any time either, can you make something sound

675
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,000
like something, whatever, here, you know, that was basically how you did game audio

676
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,480
back then. Now, of course, you know, it's completely changed and I think one thing that

677
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,840
you'll notice in the industry is that since Gang's inception back in, you know, the turn

678
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:04,080
of the century, you've seen the quality of audio and music go through the roof and that's

679
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,100
not just because of the technology, you know, you know, Gang, you know, should take a lot

680
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:16,120
of credit for that, for educating all those things, for educating them about, you know,

681
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:22,480
5.1 audio or, you know, budgets for live orchestras and how and why it makes a difference and

682
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,720
being involved from a project from the beginning, not just tailing it off at the end, it's not

683
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,620
post-production like film and television, what we do is so much different and so much

684
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:39,220
more interactive and providing the proper tools for sound designers and composers to

685
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,040
do what we need to do. These are all things that Gang does on a constant basis behind

686
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,520
the scenes, you know, some of our sponsors are EA and Dolby and some of these colleges

687
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,880
and schools and THX and, you know, all these DTS and, you know, all these amazing companies,

688
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:04,320
Microsoft and Intel and AMD and, you know, chip manufacturers and things. So, you know,

689
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,920
everybody believes in the message, it was just a matter of everyone banding together

690
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,940
and coming together as one to get that message out there as a group of people and that's

691
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,780
really what Gang is all about. Of course, we have our Gang Awards as well each year

692
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,640
where we have about 25 different categories, you know, everything from best sound design

693
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:32,300
of the year to best music of the year or best song for a video game, best licensed music

694
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,600
for a game, you know, there's best cinematic sound in a game, so there's all sorts of different

695
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,240
things that we award as well. And Bioshock cleaned up pretty much last year.

696
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah, I read that well deserved on them though.

697
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Absolutely.

698
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,640
If we have any musically inclined folks listening to the program, I know we have a few that

699
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,160
are interested in this, it's audiogang.org, correct?

700
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,280
That is it, audiogang.org. If you're looking to get in the industry doing game audio, that's

701
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,400
the first great place to start.

702
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,760
All right, well, Tommy, I got one more question for you and thank you so much for spending

703
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,720
the time here with us tonight, but we always ask this, all of our guests we bring on the

704
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,600
program, it's the way we start off our show every week, we always talk about our gaming

705
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,120
weeks and the types of games we've been playing this week and what we've been enjoying. So,

706
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,760
Tommy, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games you've been into lately?

707
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:32,800
Fantastic. No, it's funny because yesterday was Father's Day. We're taping this interview,

708
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,520
but I don't know if I said it or not, but yesterday was Father's Day. And so, me and

709
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:48,000
my dad and my brother, we played the game Buzz on PlayStation 2. It's just basically

710
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,200
a trivia game. My dad isn't a huge gamer these days. He was when I was growing up. We'd always

711
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,880
go to the arcade and play Asteroids and Space Invaders together in the late 70s when I was

712
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:06,200
like 10. And he was a huge kick-my-ass and Pac-Man every night. But now, he's gotten

713
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,440
out of it. So, we played Buzz. I played Buzz this week. I played a little rock band this

714
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:19,720
week. But also, this might get people a little jealous. I've been playing Metal Gear Solid

715
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:27,120
4, of course. I've been playing that for a couple weeks due to having some friends in

716
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:33,720
some high places and getting versions before other folks. But the thing I've really been

717
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,320
playing because I've been working on putting this segment together for Video Games Live

718
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,520
is Guitar Hero Aerosmith, which hasn't hit the shelves yet, but I've been playing a lot

719
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,080
of that lately as well.

720
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,120
So something Guitar Hero related is coming to Video Games Live?

721
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,480
An interactive segment with Guitar Hero and Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. His real name

722
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,680
is Steven Telerico. He's my cousin. We've been always talking about doing something

723
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:08,680
together and ended up getting them hooked up with Activision to get that product on

724
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:15,800
the market the first time ever. A band has its own music video game with Guitar Hero,

725
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,520
so we're all really proud of that.

726
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,880
Yeah, I'm going to put together, wouldn't it be cool if somebody could come up on stage

727
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:32,360
and play a song from Guitar Hero Aerosmith while playing along on the big screen with

728
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,600
the orchestra and with some live musicians on stage as well? Wouldn't that be cool?

729
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,920
That would be awesome, and thankfully it's Aerosmith and not that Dragonforce song from

730
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,800
Guitar Hero 3, because then I think we'd all like, you know, I would want to lose in front

731
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,240
of all those people. Aerosmith I think I could probably handle. I know those songs pretty

732
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,240
well.

733
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,480
Well, Tommy Telerico, the man behind Video Games Live, the man behind Gang, and the soundtrack

734
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,480
to so many video games. Thank you so much for spending the time tonight here on Orange

735
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,560
Lawns Radio talking about everything, and best of luck to you through the next few dates

736
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,560
of your tour.

737
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,800
Thank you, and I really appreciate you taking the time to help spread the word, because

738
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:20,760
I think what you guys are doing are so important to us and the growth of this thing, and talking

739
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,200
about it really helps us out in helping to spread the word, so thank you.

740
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,480
No problem, Tommy. Best of luck to you.

741
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,680
Okay, thanks.

742
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,640
Thank you so much to Tommy for taking the time to talk to us here at Orange Lawns Radio.

743
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,640
It was a lot of fun. He's pretty chatty, but a lot of really insightful information about

744
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,000
how the whole process works.

745
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,720
And it's funny, because I didn't believe it when he said it, Steven Tyler's last name

746
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,920
is actually Telerico.

747
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,040
Yeah, I kind of thought it was a joke when I first heard it too. That's why I didn't

748
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,380
follow up on that at all, but no, it is true. He is actually related to Steven Tyler, which

749
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,480
means he's also related to Liv Tyler.

750
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,640
All right, anyhow.

751
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,640
Hey.

752
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,640
What?

753
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,880
So, you can be related.

754
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,400
Yeah, it's just kind of neat. I kind of thought he was joking. Like, oh yeah, he's my bro.

755
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,080
He's my cousin. You know, that type of thing. I was just very surprised.

756
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,360
And it's so funny, because, you know, Loki, you exclaimed something like, if it's not

757
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,840
on Wikipedia, it's not true. And then he went to Wikipedia, and I just heard, oh. I guess

758
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
it is true.

759
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:30,360
All right, anyhow, we've got some more gaming news to cover. I know you guys on Skype are

760
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,360
eager to call in, so we want to get to you guys as well. We have a few more stories for

761
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,320
you guys quick, though. We'll start off with Loki.

762
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,120
Okay, well, last week, you know, the PSP got firmware 4.0. Well, of course, they couldn't

763
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:47,240
leave it just like that, so they put out 4.01, which, you know, is just, I guess, to make

764
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:54,560
sure that 4.0 was working correctly. And updates as far as, doesn't really say what, they improved

765
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,920
some of the search features, I guess. And that's about it.

766
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,360
Well, I don't know if they were trying to stop the homebrew stuff, but, like, pretty

767
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:08,400
much the very next day, the custom firmware 4.01 was released, so.

768
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:16,360
Yeah, Peaker Junior92 in chat says, or PK Junior, I want to say it really fast, 4.01

769
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
is a joke.

770
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Yeah.

771
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:24,640
Just like 911 is a joke. 4.01 is a joke. Maybe that could be a hit new song. 4.01 is a joke.

772
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,080
Oh, I forget it. Not a joke. The whole annoying digital rights management thing on the Xbox

773
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:37,400
Live, guess what? They have finally fixed it. There is a new DRM tool, digital rights

774
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:44,440
management tool that is available on Xbox site, on the Microsoft site. This is originally

775
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,440
going to be a part of the next patch or the next release, but it's actually available

776
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,740
now. It's available on Xbox.com. You can manage the digital rights contents of arcade titles

777
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,920
that you've downloaded and so on. I haven't used this myself, but I should, because my

778
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,560
original Xbox 360 died of the red rings of death, so I have this awkward digital management

779
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,680
thing with Geometry Wars and Joust, which were the first two arcade titles I ever bought.

780
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,840
So I should go in and try to fix that. So now you don't have to go through this whole

781
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,680
mess of getting the points credited back to you and all this stuff. In fact, you can see

782
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,560
the three-step process here. Make sure you've signed into Xbox Live with this account and

783
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,480
whatever your name is. Go to the Xbox Live Marketplace and select Account Management,

784
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,840
Download History. Select an item and then select Download again. Repeat step three for

785
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,640
each item in your download history. There you go. So if you're willing to re-download

786
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,320
the stuff, you can use the tool on Xbox.com to do it for you. And certainly that saves

787
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:45,480
customer service, a crap load of phone calls. So everybody wins in this scenario. Yay.

788
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,240
I win. What did you win? I win a story. Oh, and what would this story be about?

789
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:57,680
Well, okay, everyone knows that one of the coolest voice actors in the world, in my opinion

790
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:04,080
anyway, is David Hader. You know, he has written movies, done a fairly good job with the first

791
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:09,880
X-Men movie, actually with the first two X-Men movies since he did the screenplays. But he

792
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,720
is actually looking for a petition out to get all of the fans to sign so that he writes

793
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:23,440
the Metal Gear movie. Interesting. Well, honestly, I would have to think that he would know Snake

794
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,680
better than just about anybody except maybe Kojima. Or so many other people on Kojima's

795
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,320
team. But I think, though, that when you're the person who puts the personality into the

796
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:42,760
character, I think that you would have a bit of insight into how to properly write for

797
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:50,240
that character. So I think it's pretty cool. Well, I kind of wonder, what kind of writing

798
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,480
creds does he have? Well, I just said that he wrote the screenplays for the first two

799
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:04,920
X-Men movies. Oh, sorry. It's okay. And he's doing an adaptation of Watchmen. But he's

800
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:15,680
actually looking to have everyone actually email a rep at Sony Pictures. The address

801
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,080
is, and I'm going to go ahead and say it on the air, because honestly, I would love for

802
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:27,880
him to write the movie. He does a good job. But it's Matt, M-A-T-T underscore T-O-L-M-A-C-H

803
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:35,040
at S-P-E dot Sony dot com. So send those emails in and actually use good grammar. Please spell

804
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:40,080
check for the win. This is a really good opportunity for us to try and get David Hader on the show.

805
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,320
I know I'm going to email. I'm gonna see if you realize I'm going to be sitting in the

806
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:48,520
corner fan gasming the whole fanning yourself actually really good looking to see what we

807
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:54,620
can do about that. In a reference to the video that we saw the other day and no one else

808
00:57:54,620 --> 00:58:02,720
will get blurred fluids. Nobody's going to understand that. What? YouTube joke. What

809
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,560
was I going to say here? Some comments here in the chat room. DJ Dark Knight says as long

810
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:14,700
as he plays him. You never know. Going back to the last story, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf,

811
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,420
our next door neighbor on All Games wanted to point out about the whole digital right

812
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,480
management tool. You can only use it once every 12 months. You have to manually re-download

813
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,000
every title. If you have a lot of titles, it's going to take you a couple hours to get

814
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,720
all that stuff. Again, you can only use the tool once every 12 months. But that should

815
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,480
be enough. I mean, how many people get more than one Xbox a year unless you really get

816
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,900
screwed with the red rings of death? I mean, certainly it could happen. But iTunes has

817
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,600
a similar policy. I think you can reset your iTunes digital rights management like once

818
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,640
a year as well. But of course, then again, you can also install the music on like four

819
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:51,640
different computers. Something like that. Awesome. Well, remember there was a big to-do

820
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:57,760
about the whole hot coffee crap in Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas. And then there was a settlement

821
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,320
where people could possibly get money for not even having purchased Grand Theft Auto.

822
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,860
But you know, you just have to pretend that you did. Well, the response to the whole thing

823
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:14,860
was really only 2,676 claims. You didn't say 26,000, you said 2,000. 2,676. And how many

824
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,740
people bought Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas? Approximately 12 million. Eleventy billion?

825
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:29,740
So that apparently is approximately 0.022% of the consumers that actually were offended

826
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,720
and upset from the content in the game. In other words, people looking for a free lunch,

827
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:41,160
courtesy of Take-Two from McDonald's. And essentially that equals up to about only $1.3

828
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:48,160
million in fees. Oh, I'm sorry. Only about $30,000 in claims from all that. And apparently

829
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,680
the suit seeking $1.3 million in legal fees. That's funny. Wow. Just wow. If I had the

830
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:05,680
stupid award music still cute, I'd probably play it right about now, but unfortunately

831
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,360
I left that party. See, everyone was complaining that it was such a big deal and everyone was

832
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:16,360
making a big deal. You know who that 0.22% or 0.022% was? Jack Thompson and his family.

833
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,360
Fucking media. And just people blowing the shit out of proportion. People wanting to

834
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,680
see if it worked or not. Yeah. Seriously, out of those 2,000, how many just wanted to

835
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,960
see if it would work? That's what I'm curious about. If they got money. Did anybody in our

836
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,400
chat room do it? Probably not. Alright, well one other bit of news for you and then we're

837
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,760
going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio and

838
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,800
it is a PlayStation story and it's about the PlayStation Network specifically. I'm surprised

839
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,840
neither one of these games has been the classic game of the week yet, but maybe soon. After

840
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:52,700
all, they are going to make a resurgence pretty soon. Einhonder and Xenogears are now going

841
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,200
to be on the PlayStation Network. I like Einhonder. I'm surprised. We still need Zweihander.

842
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,640
I'm surprised Xenogears is on there since I think it's a multiple disc game. Well, hey,

843
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:09,040
they've got a lot of storage space on that PlayStation 3. So anyhow, you can now download

844
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,840
these songs. You can download these games on the PlayStation Network and there you have

845
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,640
it. They're being sold right now in Japan. Sorry, you can't do it here. It's being sold

846
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,440
for 600 yen a piece. That's about $5.56. Not bad. But unfortunately, both these games are

847
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,320
pretty text heavy, so you would probably need to understand Japanese. Not Einhonder. You

848
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,960
just fucking kill things. I'm looking right at Xenogears as I'm saying. Xenogears. Xenogears,

849
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,360
yeah. But if you know Japanese, hey, there you go. By the way, Squeenix USA has commented

850
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,480
there is currently no plans to bring this to the American Network. Yeah, well, we'll

851
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,720
see. Money talks, people. Money talks. And now you talk. 1877 Game OLR. Our username

852
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,920
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to the Skype line. The calls are already coming

853
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,920
in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? There is currently no plans to bring

854
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,240
this to the American Network. I'm hearing myself. Are you there? Talks, people. Money

855
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:07,800
talks. Okay. Please call Echo 1-2-3. If I hear myself or Dark Soccer or Loki on the

856
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,560
call, that's grounds for immediate hang up. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

857
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:17,440
Hey, hey, it's Ranma. Hey, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy? Hello. Hey, everyone. I

858
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,960
know what you were doing last night. I know what you were doing last night, too. Tell

859
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:27,600
us about it. I know what you did last night. Well, besides getting, uh, drunk with freeze

860
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,960
pop. Wait, so, when you say, you don't mean you were actually getting drunk at a freeze

861
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,220
pop concert, although that is probably true as well. You actually went out and got drunk

862
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:42,640
with freeze pop the band. Yes, this is what actually happened. I was at a broom party

863
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,300
having a good time and I left, you know, to bring some more alcohol up and I was going

864
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,880
up the stairs and I saw them and the girl, I think it was Elizabeth, she said, um, is

865
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,720
there a party going on? I'm like, yeah, follow me. Follow me right into the, um, party and

866
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,440
we've been partying ever since. And right now I'm actually downloading all the pictures

867
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,760
from the party with them as we speak. Did you remind them that OLR loves them muchly?

868
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,440
Yes, I did. In between shots. Nice. I doubt they even remember us. Only one of them came

869
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,680
on the show, but you never know. So that's what, were you just Liz or the whole band

870
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:22,560
or what? The whole band. That's awesome. So there you have it. Doing shots with the band.

871
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,280
Did they happen to let slip any, uh, things they might have coming up in the game world?

872
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,940
You know, I read recently one of their emails that went out to everybody, there was a little

873
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,880
bit of freeze pop controversy about the fact that their song, uh, I am not your game boy

874
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,680
is on guitar hero DS because it's actually not by harmonics anymore. Right. But, and

875
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,360
so they wanted to kind of clear the air that, Hey, they're loaning their songs out to, you

876
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,720
know, or no, the deal was that I think if I remember I read it on their site, they don't

877
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,320
get paid when they're in their harmonics games. Um, they do it just, you know, for the love

878
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,840
of harmonics for the love of those games, but they were getting paid by Konami when

879
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,760
it was in DDR by Sony, you know, branded games and by, you know, the folks who did guitar

880
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,360
hero on tour. So yeah, a little, a little freeze pop controversy. I thought I'd clear

881
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,400
up. Well, they really are talented. I mean, after seeing him the second time, it was really

882
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,800
awesome. They really deserve more. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. That's yeah. They they're

883
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,400
destined for stardom eventually, you know, they're, they're on the brain. Everybody knows

884
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:26,360
some of their songs from rock band and all that stuff. So, well, they did a new song

885
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:32,040
at the concert. Oh really? Yeah. They covered a popular song from the eighties as an encore

886
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:41,040
song. What was it? The final countdown. Nice. And um, that's definitely key to our friendly.

887
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:46,920
Definitely. Hey, that could be, you never know rock band too. Maybe who knows? Um, Hey,

888
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,720
here's the thing though. Next time you go drinking with Liz, since now you like have

889
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,080
her number in your black book or whatever, tell them that a OLR would love a new theme

890
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,320
song, you know, no disrespect to midi head, but we've been using the opening song now

891
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:02,960
for like two years. So we're looking for something new. So just the thought, I may be able to

892
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,040
do something. I know somebody knows somebody, so I may be able to cash in a favor. So I

893
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,720
would love you forever. All right. What else is going on in your world? Anything else you

894
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,680
want to update our listeners on real quick? Well, you're ready to drink this weekend.

895
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,400
Oh my God. That's right. You're coming to town. No, I can't drink. I could drink cider

896
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,560
and milk. Okay. I'll drink cider with you. Okay. I can't hear your cider will probably

897
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:30,520
be special cider. Oh, we'll get the, uh, the, um, uh, Blackthorn for us. No, I'm looking

898
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,240
forward to you being in town and uh, I'm looking forward to the 4th of July party when we're

899
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:41,120
going to set things on fire. Yes. Oh yeah. Rob. Yes. I have a surprise for you. Yay.

900
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:46,000
I like surprises. I'm going to present it next week. If I can be on the show, of course

901
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,460
you can be on the show. I thought you were already coming to the show. Just want to make

902
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:55,560
sure, you know, so Rama will be here in studio next week. All right. So until then I'm hanging

903
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:02,140
up on you. Cause you have all next week to talk to us. All right. Later. That's right.

904
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:07,520
That is next week. Isn't it? God time flies. That means I have to do, I'm going to be busy

905
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:14,080
this time to clean the house. Well, I already, I, my house is pretty clean. I just got to

906
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:20,280
change the cat litter. You okay over there, Loki? Sorry. I'm just getting this working.

907
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:25,520
I heard myself. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Uh, J rod. Hey, Jay rod.

908
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:30,260
What's on your mind, buddy? Uh, just asking you guys, what are you looking forward to

909
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:34,320
for you three of the most. So it's right around the corner. What am I looking forward to E3

910
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,940
the most? You know me personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how much of Microsoft press

911
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,640
conference really did get spoiled. I'm looking forward to all the press conferences. I love

912
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,360
sitting there not working and reading the press conferences. I really am looking forward

913
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,820
to seeing if animal crossing MMO or we or whatever. I'm looking forward to seeing if

914
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,780
animal if it is true that animal crossing is coming back to Nintendo and what they're

915
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,640
doing with it. I J I am so freaking curious is killing me. And of course I want it to

916
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,760
address the space issues so I gotta say Nintendo's press conference I'm

917
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,100
definitely looking forward to

918
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:08,360
Sony I don't know what I'm looking forward to hearing from Sony but

919
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,100
sometimes they really surprise you on left field so I don't think you can

920
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:11,960
predict Sony

921
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,520
Microsoft if the rumors are true they're gonna have an interesting press

922
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,320
conference ahead of them

923
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,640
I'm also looking forward to seeing how the absence of these companies is gonna

924
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,880
play into the E3 reports this year with all these

925
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,560
companies dropping out. Loki, Dark Sakura, anything you wanna add?

926
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,880
No, they'll just have pretty much like Activision so since they're not gonna be

927
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,000
there they'll probably have their own little press conference that'll

928
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,720
take place at the same time. I mean it'll pretty much be the same damn coverage.

929
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,160
I still think that they made a mistake with cutting out the

930
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,880
fanfare I just think they should have been a bit more discerning as to

931
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,240
invitations that's all.

932
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,000
Very disappointing but have you looked at the Penny Arcade

933
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,840
exhibitor list? Now that I'm happy about. That's doing it right.

934
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,040
You wanna hear something that really would piss you off?

935
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,880
My company got one invite to E3 and they said oh forget it we're not going.

936
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,440
I'm like you fuckers. You fucking whores.

937
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,320
Okay Jayrod I'm turning the tables a little bit what are you looking forward

938
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,360
to seeing at E3?

939
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,860
I am looking forward to Gears of War 2. That is my main game for this year.

940
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:18,160
Gears of War 2 and I wanna see how the new Silent Hill is turning out.

941
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,320
Oh I'm kinda iffy about that one. Apparently

942
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,040
and I haven't seen this myself but a buddy was telling me about this that

943
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,880
apparently the first 10 minutes of the game are out there on the internet and it

944
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,720
looks pretty good.

945
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,080
I don't wanna spoil anything. I'm gonna have to pass on that.

946
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,320
I don't either but you know I'm curious. But yeah Gears of War oh man people are

947
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,480
just loving that first game.

948
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,520
That'll definitely be a centerpiece of Microsoft's press conference. Probably the big final

949
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,040
thing they'll show since there's no

950
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,120
Halo this year. That's probably their second biggest franchise I can think of.

951
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,280
Chat room is asking about Kid Icarus Wii.

952
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:52,040
If it's true which I think it might be I'm definitely curious. That is another

953
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,880
curiosity.

954
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,120
I'm trying not to get my hopes up too high because I just have this really bad

955
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,800
feeling. I'm gonna look at it and go

956
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,040
ew it's so different.

957
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,600
Something tells me they're not going the Mega Man 9 route and giving us a new

958
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,640
retro game.

959
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,200
So that's what I think about Kid Icarus.

960
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,200
Alright well J-Rod thanks so much for the call. Anything else you want to share

961
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,280
really quickly?

962
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,120
Alright well have a good one.

963
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,120
Appreciate it. I had Italian today.

964
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,240
Did you? Yes I had Mary's Pizza Shack.

965
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,640
I thought you couldn't have pizza. Well I can't but on

966
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,360
they have pasta dishes there and there was a pasta dish with marinara because I can

967
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,560
usually have like light marinara pastas.

968
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,800
So it was good times. Alright I better hang up on J-Rod. Bye bye.

969
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,960
Thank you very much. Did you really want to hear us talk about Italian food the whole time?

970
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,200
Osfer says I saw a trailer for the new Silent Hill. It looked really scary.

971
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,120
I hope so. There's not

972
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,320
that many games I'm excited about right now but that Silent Hill 5 is one of

973
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,920
them. That game is supposed to be out sooner rather than later so we shall see

974
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,000
very soon.

975
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,960
What do you guys think? You want to do one more call? One more quick call?

976
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,120
Alright. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

977
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:11,240
Hola. Bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio.

978
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,120
Echo 123. Is it that hard?

979
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:20,800
Alright. That's it. We're closing the Skype line.

980
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,760
I can't deal with the lack of Echo 123 tonight.

981
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,200
Alright. I guess that's gonna do it.

982
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,800
We're gonna go around and wrap it up. First we gotta get some last minute stories.

983
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,800
Do I have a last minute story? I see you giggling over there. I'm just in a giggle

984
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,760
giggle mood. Why? Because I am. You can't be happy.

985
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,480
It's not allowed. I can be as happy as I want to be Rob.

986
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,400
And I'm gonna whine so that you have to put up with it.

987
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,000
No I don't. Neener. Loki you have any last minute stories?

988
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,120
Uh. You did? Yes. Alright then read it. Stop your bitching.

989
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,120
This is

990
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,360
a story that Sauce gave me

991
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,720
like an hour ago or so that

992
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,040
Apple Corps has given the okay

993
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,240
for a computer game to be released based on the Beatles.

994
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,800
Since they own the master recordings. Really? Yep.

995
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,160
Very interesting. And they are

996
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,960
trying to decide who's gonna get it and they are between Activision and MTV

997
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,000
games.

998
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,480
Oh snap.

999
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,040
Is that for real? That is crazy. Alright.

1000
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,920
We'll see. Loki you have any last minute stories?

1001
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,040
Um. I don't know.

1002
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,640
No. Not really. Really? Wow. Yeah well I haven't been looking at

1003
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,480
last minute stories. I've been working on other crap. Apparently Catwoman is gonna be

1004
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,800
Marvel vs. DC Universe and she has

1005
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,160
a lot of cleavage apparently. Surprise.

1006
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,880
Tigerclaw mentions in chatroom. By the way Sky you know that Bill Gates

1007
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,440
officially retired.

1008
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,080
Yes. But he'll still always be kind of like a mascot of sorts to that company

1009
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,880
don't you think?

1010
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,320
I mean he's gone but he's not. You know what I mean? Well didn't he drop out of

1011
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,640
high school and start his own company?

1012
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,040
Hey you know what? Just a day's dedication. Seriously?

1013
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,280
Just a day's dedication. Alright well. He dropped out of college that was it.

1014
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,880
Yeah. Well so did I and look at me I'm on the internet with the

1015
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,880
radio program with my friends. Hey. Winners don't use drugs.

1016
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,160
Alright let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1017
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,120
Loki what's your final thought tonight? I fucking hate

1018
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,200
PHP.

1019
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,320
My final thought is I

1020
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,400
really want another piece of ice cream cake

1021
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,560
because the one I cheated with on my birthday and had was really

1022
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,560
really really fucking good. Dark Soccer your final thought tonight.

1023
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:58,120
I really want some creme brulee right now. Oh my fucking god creme brulee is the shit.

1024
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,040
I'm gonna go get some creme brulee ice cream I think.

1025
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,720
Since we are orange lounge foodie-o I have to mention real quick. This is our first mention of food tonight.

1026
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:11,160
Olive Garden. Yeah we did have Olive Garden. Here's the thing. Did you know that Claim

1027
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,040
Jumper now has like a healthy menu with

1028
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,320
foods under 600 calories a dish or something? Under 600 calories a dish.

1029
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,480
Look for them. Half a day food. For them that's that's really good.

1030
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,120
Well a bowl of soup and some of their garlic toast is under 600.

1031
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,960
Yeah but now they have like salads and stuff that are really good and under

1032
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,760
under 600 calories. What was I gonna say?

1033
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,840
I don't know but they're really good. Oh they have the creme brulee. They have like a new dessert dish

1034
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,240
that's three of different flavors of creme brulee.

1035
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,520
Like the green tea and all that stuff and the little tiny dishes. Do you want?

1036
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,040
My god so I do kinda want actually. Although I probably should be good after

1037
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,600
massively cheating on my birthday.

1038
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,360
This isn't really a last minute story but it's it's interesting nonetheless.

1039
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:56,840
But apparently there's a price drop on a cat skin for your Wii.

1040
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,920
Yes it's a cute little kitten that you can put on your Wii.

1041
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,280
I will post it in chat. There you have it.

1042
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,840
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so
