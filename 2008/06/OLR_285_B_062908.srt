00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:05,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:14,726
[SPEAKER_03]: To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:19,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:20,680
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

5
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:58,302
[SPEAKER_04]: and tonight for your entertainment Tommy Tallarico is going to be here on Orange Laundry to talk about video games live very shortly but first we're going to talk about some gaming news and I thought since you know we are going to be talking about music and video games how about some music news you have some music game news for us Loki you could share

6
00:00:58,582 --> 00:00:59,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do actually.

7
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:01,863
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some pretty interesting stuff.

8
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been kind of hoping for this to actually happen.

9
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently a box shot of Samba de Amigo, a bundle with Maraca controller add-ons, has been seen at UK retailer HMV's website.

10
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:27,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I hope they aren't the cheapy, crappy little plastic snap-on things like you've seen for Wii Golf and Wii Tennis, right?

11
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they need to make the shaky maraca noise.

12
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like that they have maracas on top of it.

13
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:36,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they make the shaky noise, but I don't see why they wouldn't.

14
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:39,824
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to do maraca controllers, do them right, or don't do them at all, right?

15
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:43,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's right now on there for â‚¬34.99, which is about $70.

16
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:43,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

17
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And we always like to read comments from chat.

18
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:54,195
[SPEAKER_04]: The ever-present fourth guest on our show at chat.orangeloungeradio.com live on Sunday.

19
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And J-Rod says simply, Maracas equals win.

20
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Maracas do equal win.

21
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,142
[SPEAKER_04]: What other games could be made better by Maracas?

22
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,964
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you think of anything?

23
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Games that could be made better with Maracas?

24
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:07,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

25
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:09,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Um...

26
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:13,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Calibur?

27
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:13,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

28
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Maraca Calibur.

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, I did Rod Calibur.

30
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you do Rod Calibur on the Dreamcast.

31
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Simply be Maraca Calibur.

32
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:20,325
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

33
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:22,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got Maraca's controllers.

34
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too, on Dreamcast, believe it or not.

35
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try Maraca's Calibur.

36
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, any game can be played with the Maraca's...

37
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,824
[SPEAKER_05]: 3rdBullet suggests Gears of Maracas.

38
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:35,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Gears of Maracas?

39
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Miso suggests Cooking Mama is better with Maracas.

40
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:47,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that's kind of weird about the Maraca controller, though, I noticed, is that... Where's the infrared going to come out?

41
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it goes all the way through the middle there.

42
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:53,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it looks like the top's covered by the Maracas.

43
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:54,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

44
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

45
00:02:55,905 --> 00:03:00,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one game that will not be made better by Maracas is a game near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Launch Radio.

46
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Beatmania 2DX.

47
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,992
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this series has been around forever, a long, long time.

48
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:12,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember when we first started this show, probably like Six Style was the hot new thing that was out on the block, I think, when this show started.

49
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:13,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

50
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:14,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Beatmania 2DX16

51
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That is incredibly gay looking.

52
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:46,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

53
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:46,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute.

54
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:48,829
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it really is.

55
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:52,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pink Sailor Moon looking logo with a butterfly.

56
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:53,511
[SPEAKER_04]: 2DX16 Empress.

57
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:57,133
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little butterfly hanging off the S and it's pink.

58
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very, very, very pink.

59
00:03:59,474 --> 00:03:59,494
[SPEAKER_04]: V2

60
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,081
[SPEAKER_04]: is supposed to be in this game.

61
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:26,103
[SPEAKER_04]: A sequel to V by Taka.

62
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,866
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most horrid songs in Beatmania 2DX history.

63
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:33,071
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever walked by a Beatmania or a DDR machine, you've probably heard this one.

64
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:36,234
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually is a V final from that Taka album that came out.

65
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

66
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,376
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

67
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:54,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So Beatmania 2DX Empress location testing right now, which means they'll probably be out in Japan in a couple months, and you'll probably see the home version in Japan only, sadly, early next year because they tried to release Beatmania here, and unfortunately it didn't do too well because people thought it was a Guitar Hero ripoff.

68
00:04:55,942 --> 00:05:00,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on Konami for sitting on what could have been a gold mine for far, far, far too long.

69
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:16,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, another potential goldmine, and this is one that was sent to us by the lovely and talented Sauce, is a Rumor of Guitar Hero Beatles edition, which actually I think would be pretty cool.

70
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:19,517
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of neat.

71
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:23,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that more of the young whippersnappers need to hear some Beatles music.

72
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:41,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Sony ATV CEO, Marty Bondier, I guess, said that they've actually talked about putting Beatles songs in a Guitar Hero game as something that you'd like to pursue, and that's a quote.

73
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So, maybe it could happen?

74
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting booted from the chat room.

75
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch me do it.

76
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a democracy here at OLR.

77
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:17,615
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Jamieocracy.

78
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is it?

79
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:19,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Third Bullet?

80
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,597
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to read.

81
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:22,957
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

82
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:23,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamocracy?

83
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:25,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamocracy?

84
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamocracy.

85
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:26,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

86
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Revolution!

87
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Off with her head.

88
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

89
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:30,761
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

90
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:40,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um... I don't know if we're gonna... We'll probably be getting this before we'll see Beatles on any sort of system for it.

91
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:49,056
[SPEAKER_05]: But Rock Band is getting, um... I guess some tracks from Crew Fest, which is the Motley Crue tour, I guess.

92
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:50,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

93
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,666
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a few tracks on here, including a free one.

94
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:59,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the CrewFest pack, which is going to be 240 Microsoft points, or $3.

95
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,891
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got Down at the Whiskey by Motley Crue.

96
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,493
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got Time is Running Out by Papa Roach.

97
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:10,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's Going Home With You Tonight by Trapped.

98
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the free track, Promised Land by...

99
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,327
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

100
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:46,803
[SPEAKER_04]: G4's Judgment Day

101
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So we reached out to Tommy to come on the show to talk about the upcoming tour As well as respond to some of the recent emails we've gotten about Video Games Live So let's head on over to the Skype line Alright, hey Tommy, are you there?

102
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:25,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, I am here Hey Tommy Tallarico, how are you doing this fine evening?

103
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:35,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing great, working as always You must be a very, very busy man traveling to all these new places on the Video Games Live tour Do you actually go to all the shows yourself?

104
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:42,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, every single show aside from creating and producing the show every night.

105
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:46,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I also host the show and even play guitar with the symphony towards the end.

106
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:53,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to be pretty exhausted because not only are you balancing video games live, but video games live isn't the only thing you do either.

107
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:15,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, aside from still working on a few smaller game projects here and there, because VGL definitely takes up most of 95% of my time, but working on a couple DS and Wii and PC products, as well as also the chairman of the Game Audio Network Guild.

108
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:16,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

109
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I definitely want to ask you about the Game Audio Network Guild, but I know the listeners want to hear about Video Games Live, absolutely, because we've gotten emails and calls about it.

110
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you this about Video Games Live.

111
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:30,865
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to so many new places on this 50-day city tour you just announced.

112
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:35,130
[SPEAKER_04]: What can someone who has never been to Video Games Live before expect to experience?

113
00:09:36,299 --> 00:10:04,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Video Games Live is all the greatest video game music of all time played by a full symphony and choir but what makes it really unique is that everything is completely synchronized with video and rock and roll lighting and special effects and interactivity with the crowd and stage show production and we have a whole pre-show festival with gaming competitions and prize giveaways and

114
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:19,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Costume Contest, Post Show, Meet & Greet It really is a complete celebration of the entire video game industry.

115
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:28,942
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I like to describe it as all of the power and emotion of a symphony orchestra combined with the excitement and energy of a rock concert

116
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,822
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

117
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to create an event.

118
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:50,153
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to create a show.

119
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:59,437
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to just create a concert or, oh yeah, here's a bunch of classical people in tuxedos up on a stage playing video game music.

120
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:07,480
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great as well, but people have been doing that in Japan for almost 20 years now.

121
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:12,126
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to do something completely new, completely unique.

122
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:17,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, our goal from the beginning was to create this show for...

123
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:19,425
[SPEAKER_00]: The Non-Gamer as well.

124
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:33,078
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to create something that had mass appeal and that you don't have to know a darn thing at all about video games in order to come to the show and really be blown away and entertained.

125
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:40,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Video Games Live has grown so quickly and as big as it has.

126
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:41,386
[SPEAKER_00]: We did three shows in 2005.

127
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,241
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 shows in 2006, 29 last year in 2007.

128
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:50,082
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we have over 50 shows.

129
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year we have over 80 shows.

130
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:58,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal is to build it by 2010 up to 100 and to 120 shows a year.

131
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:07,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having all these visuals and by creating a performance and a production and an event and a show,

132
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,245
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more.

133
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:37,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's not to downplay what all of the amazing concerts in the past have done and continue to do, but ours is a little different.

134
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:43,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go off of that a little bit, because you talk about making this concert accessible to even those that are non-gamers.

135
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have a lot of listeners that are a little bit younger, 15, 16, 17.

136
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:50,235
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little harder for them to just kind of get up and go get a concert ticket.

137
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:54,976
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say would be the best way to sell a night at Video Games Live to my parents?

138
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:57,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, oh, absolutely.

139
00:12:57,118 --> 00:13:03,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, of course, there's a website, videogameslive.com, and we have a bunch of trailers on there.

140
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:07,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see parents in their 40s and 50s.

141
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:10,307
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see grandmas in their 60s and 70s.

142
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:13,229
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see little girls, 7, 8, 9 years old, all saying,

143
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,200
[SPEAKER_00]: www.DarkSakura.com

144
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:54,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I created this in the beginning was to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games and of course their music have become.

145
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best letters and emails that we get after a performance, they come pouring in.

146
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:01,834
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all from non-gamers.

147
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:13,060
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all from the people who are blown away going, oh my gosh, I never knew that video games were this incredible and the music was so powerful and the characters and the storylines were so

148
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,150
[SPEAKER_00]: www.DarkSakura.com

149
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:38,604
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put in these comments and we'll put in, we show all of the reviews that we've gotten for the show and all of the comments and letters from people and non-gamers.

150
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:46,746
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those reviews, they all kind of, you know, follow the same thing going, well, you know what, I wasn't into video games, I didn't know what to expect, but wow, you know.

151
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:56,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's word of mouth that really is, I kind of compare us a little bit in that respect to Cirque du Soleil in that, you know, the first time people had

152
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of Cirque du Soleil.

153
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:58,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was one of them.

154
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like, what the hell is it?

155
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it circus animals running around?

156
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:04,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Clowns?

157
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.

158
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:14,559
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only until you saw it with your own two eyes or somebody really close to you explained it in great detail where you start to go, oh, I get it.

159
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:20,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, yeah, you could watch the 1,500 plus YouTube videos that are on there right now.

160
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,764
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a search for video games live and they'll all come up.

161
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:40,268
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people always tell us, you know, I watched all the YouTube videos, but until you're there, until you're experiencing that magic of being in a room with 3, 4, 5,000 people all experiencing it at once, there's some magic that goes on.

162
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,469
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube is never a substitution for anything like this.

163
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:44,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

164
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:49,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you guys are doing, however the word is getting out there, obviously it's working.

165
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Video Games Live is coming up on its three-year anniversary pretty soon, if I'm not mistaken.

166
00:15:55,492 --> 00:16:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on what you're saying, ramping up to 120 shows in 2010, it's not slowing down anytime soon.

167
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:07,156
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say, Tommy, is the biggest accomplishment, the biggest thing you've accomplished from Video Games Live in its three-year history so far?

168
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think that...

169
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a dream.

170
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:22,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and my fellow video game composer, Jack Wall, who also conducts video games live, and we kind of created the show together.

171
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,943
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us three years to create the show.

172
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:34,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning, we started this in 2002, and everyone thought we were completely insane and completely crazy.

173
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that our biggest... Show them.

174
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:50,412
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting this thing up and running to the point where... I could point to certain singular things that happened.

175
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:57,673
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, our first show ever was at the Hollywood Bowl on July 6, 2005 with the LA Phil.

176
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:02,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 11,000 people showed up to that show.

177
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:06,355
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought 2,000 or 3,000 people were going to show up or whatever.

178
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:09,336
[SPEAKER_00]: What an accomplishment to say that

179
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,439
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

180
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:33,548
[SPEAKER_00]: The First to Play in Brazil and places like Spain and London, England, New Zealand, things like that.

181
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:50,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I can point to a lot of those things, but I just think the idea that this is surviving and growing at the rate it is, I think when everyone in the beginning told us we were insane and crazy and it would never work, that's the greatest accomplishment for us.

182
00:17:50,697 --> 00:18:03,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of building on that, because you've talked about all these places you've been, and that you're kind of the first video game concert in Canada, and the first concert in Asia, and things kind of keep growing.

183
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, through these latest tour dates, you guys are going to Germany, China, Thailand, Portugal.

184
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:10,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, your passport is probably very impressive.

185
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:14,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to wonder, how do you select the places that you're going to go?

186
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:18,305
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you decide, we're going to do this in Asia, or we're going to go to Portugal?

187
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,005
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you pick where you're going?

188
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question.

189
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:23,783
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of different ways, actually.

190
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:33,394
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now grown to a point where people are now knocking our doors down, trying to get us.

191
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,556
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in China...

192
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Contacted us.

193
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:44,456
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing Beijing and Hong Kong, multiple dates.

194
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:47,357
[SPEAKER_00]: The people from Singapore contacted us.

195
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:48,898
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing.

196
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:58,083
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of all the places in the United States, we had a really important show at the end of April where it was our debut on Broadway in New York City.

197
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:03,105
[SPEAKER_00]: A very important thing for any actor performance is

198
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:08,569
[SPEAKER_00]: and we sold out the show three months in advance and so that was a huge accomplishment.

199
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:16,975
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is that sends messages to all of the other promoters and cities and symphonies and buyers of this material.

200
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:22,720
[SPEAKER_00]: It sends out a strong message and so they start knocking down our doors so at this point for us

201
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:36,610
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're trying to do is take all of these things and make some kind of sensible routing or sensible order and figuring out, okay, which ones do we pick?

202
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,454
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if the San Diego Symphony contacts us, oh, hey, let's do it during Comic-Con in San Diego.

203
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:46,396
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

204
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:15,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get a petition going to bring video games live to Taiwan.

205
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:18,750
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the very first video game concert ever in Taiwan.

206
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:23,572
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked if she could use our logo and things.

207
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,532
[SPEAKER_00]: to start a petition.

208
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,873
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to make up flyers and pass them out.

209
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:29,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, sure, absolutely.

210
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:32,756
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was kind of cool and adorable.

211
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:43,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, she contacts me and she has an Excel spreadsheet and a link that I could follow.

212
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:47,005
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, hey, look, been working really hard.

213
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:47,826
[SPEAKER_00]: www.DarkSakura.com

214
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:08,705
[SPEAKER_00]: www.DarkSakura.com

215
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Matthews Vans

216
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:02,224
[SPEAKER_00]: might be super popular in America and they might sell out 20,000 seat stadiums.

217
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,665
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they go to Germany, maybe not so much.

218
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:08,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when they go to Spain, no one knows who they are.

219
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Korea, no one's heard of them, right?

220
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:12,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reverse is true.

221
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:16,828
[SPEAKER_04]: European bands try to break you here all the time and people have no idea who they are.

222
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,928
[SPEAKER_04]: They just never really catch on.

223
00:22:18,562 --> 00:22:20,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and the same with Japan as well.

224
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:25,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas video games, music, what a universal thing.

225
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, although the game popularity might

226
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,486
[SPEAKER_00]: might change from region to region.

227
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the U.S.

228
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:48,693
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we might play Halo as our big grand finale, but maybe down in Brazil, where the PlayStation is a lot more predominant and not so many Xboxes, maybe a game like Castlevania or Nintendo is big down there as well.

229
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's Mario or Castlevania down in Brazil.

230
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:51,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And so...

231
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,657
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

232
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,371
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more.

233
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,388
[SPEAKER_00]: www.DarkSakura.com

234
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:08,306
[SPEAKER_00]: than I've seen and experienced in other parts of the world.

235
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:13,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Even down in Mexico, we played a smaller town in Mexico a couple months ago.

236
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,828
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at the end of March.

237
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:21,070
[SPEAKER_00]: We played a 7,000-seat bullring in Mexico, Mexicali, Mexico.

238
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,651
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Mexico City, which is the biggest city in the world, which people may not be aware of.

239
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

240
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:44,708
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 gamers who showed up.

241
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:46,408
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's funny, Tommy?

242
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:52,730
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those people that were there at that concert in Mexicali actually called us that next weekend.

243
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

244
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he's one of our listeners, Actdeft, and he said he had a great time at the show, can't wait to go back.

245
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:01,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was going to kind of lead into my next question, which I think you might have already answered.

246
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:12,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about the girl from Taipei, but if there's somebody who wants this event to come to their city or come back to their city, what do you think is the best way for them to go about doing this?

247
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:18,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to get a petition from every city, but what do you think would be the best way for somebody to get this back to their town?

248
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:25,084
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually put this in the FAQ on our website as well because we get asked that same question by so many people.

249
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:34,409
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other question that's asked a lot is how do you pick which music to play for different cities or countries that you go to?

250
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:37,251
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a two-part answer.

251
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:43,054
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question is we have a mailing list on the front page.

252
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,776
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Video Games Live mailing list and we don't spam people.

253
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:54,561
[SPEAKER_00]: We send out something maybe once every couple of months or if it's coming to your area, we'll geotarget your area to let you know that

254
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:55,902
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

255
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:25,173
[SPEAKER_00]: for that area so I can geo-target like a 200 mile radius around the city that we're going to and it will show me out of all the people who signed up for the mailing list what they want to hear most.

256
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,156
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, each show we do we have our

257
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:28,976
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

258
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:52,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you start to, we play about 20 segments in an evening.

259
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:55,002
[SPEAKER_00]: That constitutes about a two and a half hour presentation.

260
00:26:55,502 --> 00:27:09,497
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so one night we might, you know, if we're in France, for example, and, you know, the game Beyond Good and Evil was created by my good friend Michelle Ancel at Ubisoft in France, we're going to play

261
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:10,578
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

262
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:46,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, we have, you know, in Asia, you know, stuff like StarCraft II and WarCraft, and StarCraft II hasn't even come out, but we're still, we're already playing the music and the video.

263
00:27:46,472 --> 00:27:51,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And games like WarCraft and StarCraft are super huge over in Asia.

264
00:27:52,359 --> 00:28:00,182
[SPEAKER_00]: But not so much down in Brazil, because a lot of people are less about PC gaming and more about Nintendo and Sony.

265
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:05,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So down in Brazil, stuff like Metroid and Castlevania is huge down there.

266
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:12,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So we vary, but we really listen to the fans from that area to decide.

267
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:13,826
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people want to...

268
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:16,549
[SPEAKER_00]: bring our show to their city.

269
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:27,024
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an email address info at videogameslive.com and we collect all those emails and normally someone will get back to you within 24 hours.

270
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:28,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, excellent.

271
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:35,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not only Actdeft, but all of our listeners who are hoping to get video games live in their backyard are successful with that.

272
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of listeners going to this show, I have to bring this up.

273
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,073
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be a little silly, but I gotta ask it.

274
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:41,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny.

275
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:48,156
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our listeners, DJ Jani, wrote us on a previous show, and he was talking about the Video Games Live tour stop in Las Vegas.

276
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:56,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Raved about the show, said he had a great time, but one part that kind of cracked me up is he specifically mentioned that you change outfits quite a bit during the show.

277
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you...

278
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you coordinating your wardrobe to match the games, or what's up?

279
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:05,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you exactly, and I'll explain it, and it's, again, a great question.

280
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:07,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm Cher up in this motherfucker.

281
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:09,023
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm like Cher.

282
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:09,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to change everyone.

283
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Madonna, you know, Britney.

284
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,705
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's three times.

285
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:17,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a two-and-a-half-hour performance.

286
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:21,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I host the show, of course, as I mentioned, and...

287
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:26,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be respectful to the symphony and the people on stage.

288
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,353
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the same token, I've been a video game composer for 18 years.

289
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:40,379
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might come out in an Armani suit, but I might be wearing Nike sneakers and a Spider-Man shirt underneath or a Mickey Mouse shirt underneath or whatever.

290
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what you'd call it.

291
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:48,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Casual whatever.

292
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:48,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

293
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:50,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Casual tux or something.

294
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:50,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

295
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:53,888
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the beginning, I kind of do that.

296
00:29:54,128 --> 00:30:01,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a 20-minute intermission, and I come back, and now the shirt's on buttons.

297
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,436
[SPEAKER_00]: The coattails might be off.

298
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,658
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn down the lights a little bit for this segment.

299
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:18,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, I come out with a guitar, and it would look silly of me to be wearing a suit and playing guitar, so...

300
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,208
[SPEAKER_00]: by The Encore.

301
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:25,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of in, you know, a little bit more rock and roll gear, if you will.

302
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,430
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, so I changed three times.

303
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Once at the beginning to be kind of more formal, and then it kind of evolves into not so formal.

304
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:33,871
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

305
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:34,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that makes sense.

306
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:36,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for helping to explain that.

307
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:36,732
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

308
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very important question about being in his life.

309
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:39,613
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.

310
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:40,093
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.

311
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: This really is an important question about Video Games Live.

312
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:46,746
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are wondering, is there a CD at some point in the future?

313
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of digital distribution?

314
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:49,692
[SPEAKER_04]: iTunes?

315
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:50,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Question mark?

316
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

317
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:56,320
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's something that was supposed to come out last fall.

318
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:11,649
[SPEAKER_00]: The record company made the decision that they didn't want it to come out during Christmas season because they didn't want it to get lost in all the great games that always come out around that time.

319
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:16,895
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're going to delay it to the first quarter of this year.

320
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:22,238
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're thinking, oh, maybe come out like around, you know, February or March instead.

321
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:25,059
[SPEAKER_00]: After all the Christmas hype had subsided.

322
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:29,201
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're working on some new great pieces.

323
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:33,523
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time I was working on, because a lot of people also, they email us.

324
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:35,612
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

325
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:24,365
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I was working on this Castlevania thing and I was just like man I really want to get this on the album so I asked EMI who's one of the biggest record companies in the world who's putting the album out I kind of begged and pleaded I said hey can we

326
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,116
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

327
00:32:47,830 --> 00:33:17,302
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about all over Europe all over Asia it's the first time ever that a video game compilation album is being released by a major record company around the world it's never happened before and the licensing if you can imagine the licensing you know going through companies like Halo and I mean Microsoft for Halo and Ubisoft for Myst and you know Konami for Castlevania I mean it got to be you know it was a bit of a

328
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:21,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Nightmare at first because no one had ever really done anything like this before.

329
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:23,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing we encountered.

330
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:30,024
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it took us three years to get the first concert in order because no one had ever done it to the scale and size that we were doing.

331
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:33,164
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be released all over the world.

332
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:38,225
[SPEAKER_00]: July 22nd is the release date here in America, which we're coinciding.

333
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:40,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason we wanted to delay it

334
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:41,947
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

335
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside Show, San Diego Symphony, so many special guests.

336
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:12,198
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also having synchronized fireworks as well for that show.

337
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:17,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is all in celebration as well of our album being released that week.

338
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:21,527
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to wait for something big, and that was the one.

339
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:25,050
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of our European release, we're going to do that.

340
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We're playing a 7,000-seat stadium in Leipzig.

341
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:30,215
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Leipzig Arena.

342
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:34,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there during the Games Convention in August.

343
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to wait to release the album in August in Europe.

344
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:43,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it be around a big press and marketing event and things like that.

345
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:50,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Asia, we're going to be releasing it right around the time of the Olympics where we're playing in Taipei in the beginning of August.

346
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:55,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we're going to do the big release there, the very first video game concert ever in Asia.

347
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:56,563
[SPEAKER_00]: China, Taiwan, etc.

348
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:21,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.

349
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:31,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And we here at OLR, I think we can all agree we're very comfortable with you delaying the CD to incorporate Castlevania because that game is incredible and the music is awesome.

350
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:41,366
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when Miyamoto â€“ I worked with Miyamoto on Metroid Prime and I've known him for many years.

351
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:44,767
[SPEAKER_00]: He's such a great guy and he once told me â€“

352
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:47,529
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

353
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:19,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you wish all game companies and game makers and game developers had that same sense about them?

354
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:26,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is Halo Halo and Half-Life Half-Life and why any Miyamoto product is what it is?

355
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:31,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they refuse to let anything out that's not perfect.

356
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the best it could possibly be at that time.

357
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:36,803
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel the same way.

358
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:38,524
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just rush out an album and

359
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,274
[SPEAKER_00]: We were making Castlevania.

360
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:41,775
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, I got to get this on.

361
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:46,317
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really popular track that we love to perform.

362
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're absolutely right.

363
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:51,340
[SPEAKER_04]: In gaming, a lot of people get very frustrated with these delays sometimes.

364
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:51,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

365
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's for a good reason.

366
00:36:53,561 --> 00:37:00,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know the funny thing about that, too, is that you'll notice people will bitch and moan like crazy when it keeps getting delayed.

367
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:04,527
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second those games come out â€“ I worked on Metroid Prime.

368
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:07,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were working on it for five freaking years or something â€“

369
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:09,013
[SPEAKER_00]: with Miyamoto, right?

370
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:15,372
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing you'll notice though is when the game comes out and it's freaking perfect.

371
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:17,149
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

372
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:40,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.

373
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:56,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that, Tommy.

374
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:56,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in L.A.

375
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,421
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to go to the show.

376
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stuck doing work.

377
00:38:00,824 --> 00:38:01,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do it.

378
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:02,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so mad.

379
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:13,502
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

380
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe just the theme from the very first game.

381
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That really haunting little melody in the beginning and the kind of upbeat as it goes through.

382
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the classic.

383
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:45,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

384
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:48,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of partial to the soundtrack for Silent Hill 4.

385
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what my co-host would say about that.

386
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're all about Silent Hill 2.

387
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:53,084
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the tough part?

388
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,004
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the tough part?

389
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:56,905
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something to think about too from my end is that

390
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:09,551
[SPEAKER_00]: The music from Silent Hill is a perfect example where certain games, it's very hard to translate to a live performance, especially when you're talking about a symphony on stage.

391
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:11,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Silent Hill is one of those games.

392
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:16,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the other game that was very, very challenging and I didn't want to put in the show until I...

393
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:17,985
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

394
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:42,901
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did with Metroid is we decided to, let's try to create that beginning that everyone knows and loves so much.

395
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:49,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to kind of recreate those electronics and bleeps and bloops with the symphony.

396
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And add in the electronics, add in the original...

397
00:39:54,335 --> 00:40:09,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds from the game and play those live with the symphony as well to kind of give it this really super duper retro feel because if you try to just do it with instruments, it sometimes doesn't translate, you know, so we're really happy with with

398
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:19,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see it myself, hopefully in San Jose.

399
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:25,199
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing, I want to kind of ask you about some of the other stuff outside of Video Games Live.

400
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're kind of longer than we anticipated in the beginning.

401
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:27,940
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

402
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:28,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having a good time.

403
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to ask you about some of your other stuff besides just Video Games Live.

404
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:32,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me take another listener question here.

405
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:40,509
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our listeners, DarkTetsuya, wanted to know, do you have a favorite piece that you've ever worked on for the video game music that you've composed?

406
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.

407
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go with two, actually.

408
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:51,897
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that I did for Earthworm Jim is some of my favorite stuff.

409
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:57,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And more so, not necessarily even from a composing standpoint, but from a...

410
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:07,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a silliness standpoint in terms of like when we were working on Earthworm Jim, there was like 10 guys in a room all trying to make each other laugh.

411
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:10,648
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Earthworm Jim.

412
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:11,968
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did.

413
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,929
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a year to make each other laugh.

414
00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:16,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And you totally can't tell from the way it turned out.

415
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right?

416
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:24,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was such a great experience and just doing it so, so differently.

417
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that team had been together for a long time.

418
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:27,956
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked on â€“

419
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:29,917
[SPEAKER_00]: The original Terminator game.

420
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:32,220
[SPEAKER_00]: We did Global Gladiators for the Genesis.

421
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did Cool Spot.

422
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:35,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did Disney's Aladdin.

423
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:36,744
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did Earthworm Jim 1 and 2.

424
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:41,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And then MDK after that before everyone kind of started their own companies.

425
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:44,491
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was such a great experience.

426
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:50,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say if I had a personal favorite, that would be it.

427
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:52,479
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of composition, though...

428
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,681
[SPEAKER_00]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

429
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:27,011
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was really happy with the way the music composition turned out in that and it was something I've always wanted to do my whole life and so I really put my heart and soul into that score.

430
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:31,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully people will get a second chance to check that out if it ever makes its way to the Xbox Originals.

431
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:32,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.

432
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:35,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Audio Network Guild or GANG What's GANG up to this year?

433
00:42:51,001 --> 00:43:05,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the biggest thing, the biggest thing that the gang has just done last week, in fact, was launched the version 3.0 of our website, which is a complete networking mass.

434
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really, you know, the third word in gang, network, right?

435
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:11,614
[SPEAKER_00]: The Game Audio Network Guild.

436
00:43:12,194 --> 00:43:16,219
[SPEAKER_00]: This was always our dream to have this kind of portal and website available.

437
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:32,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think of like, you know, MySpace meets, you know, the Game Developers Association, you know, or the IGDA or, you know, Gamasutra.com or any of those great websites out there.

438
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Networking is so important in our industry.

439
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:53,734
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk to people about people trying to get in the industry or give speeches at schools or whatever, I always say that the creative aspect of what you do is only about 50% of it.

440
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:54,535
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 50% is networking.

441
00:43:54,555 --> 00:43:55,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that to any...

442
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:03,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Musician.

443
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:22,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of practicing piano for 10 hours a day, if you practice that for 5 hours a day and then you take the other 5 hours and use that to network and to get to know people or to send emails or to help better yourself or your personality or whatever.

444
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:23,179
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to

445
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:24,465
[SPEAKER_00]: www.DarkSakura.com

446
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:41,397
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more.

447
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Game Audio Curriculum for Colleges and Universities

448
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:35,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, some of these colleges and universities are places like Berklee School of Music in Boston, places like UCLA and USC.

449
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:37,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the finest schools in the world.

450
00:45:38,327 --> 00:45:49,792
[SPEAKER_00]: and even some specialized colleges, accredited colleges, you know, places like Full Sail in Florida, for example, or Guild Hall in Texas or Expressions in San Francisco.

451
00:45:49,892 --> 00:46:05,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, working, it's been a passion of mine from the beginning to really, you know, help the game audio industry have more respect and to educate not only each other as composers and sound designers but

452
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:08,626
[SPEAKER_00]: But also to educate the developers and the publishers as well.

453
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:13,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I first got in this industry almost 20 years ago, they didn't care.

454
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:16,350
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't give a crap about video game audio.

455
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:26,296
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so like â€“ I mean a typical day in the office back in the early 90s would be somebody walking in my office saying, okay â€“

456
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:38,936
[SPEAKER_00]: The game's done, we don't have any music, we don't have any money or budget, we don't have any space left on the cartridge, and oh yeah, we gotta submit this in two days, so we don't have any time either.

457
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:39,886
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

458
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:03,795
[SPEAKER_00]: and music go through the roof.

459
00:47:03,835 --> 00:47:07,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not just because of the technology.

460
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:14,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Gang should take a lot of credit for that, for educating all those things, for educating them about

461
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:15,453
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.1 Audio

462
00:47:36,848 --> 00:47:40,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound designers and composers to do what we need to do.

463
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:45,574
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that gang does on a constant basis behind the scenes.

464
00:47:45,855 --> 00:48:00,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our sponsors are EA and Dolby and some of these colleges and schools and THX and all these DTS and all these amazing companies, Microsoft and Intel and AMD and

465
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:15,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Chip manufacturers and things so everybody believes in the message it was just a matter of everyone banding together to get that and coming together as one to get that message out there as a group of people and that's really

466
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:23,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we have our gang awards as well each year where we have about 25 different categories.

467
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:33,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from best sound design of the year to best music of the year or best song written for a video game, best licensed music for a game.

468
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:38,000
[SPEAKER_00]: There's best cinematic sound in a game, so there's all sorts of different categories.

469
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,600
[SPEAKER_00]: AudioGang.org

470
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:05,018
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, Tommy, I got one more question for you.

471
00:49:05,178 --> 00:49:07,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you so much for spending the time here with us tonight.

472
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:11,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But we always ask this, all of our guests we bring on the program.

473
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the way we start off our show every week.

474
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We always talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games we've been playing this week and what we've been enjoying.

475
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Tommy, how was your gaming week?

476
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,063
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of video games you've been into lately?

477
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:23,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.

478
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:28,285
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny because yesterday I played.

479
00:49:29,025 --> 00:49:29,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Father's Day, Buzz,

480
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:45,890
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

481
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little rock band this week.

482
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:20,894
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, this might get people a little jealous, I've been playing Metal Gear Solid 4, of course.

483
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing that for a couple weeks.

484
00:50:24,915 --> 00:50:26,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Guitar Hero Aerosmith

485
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:45,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Which hasn't hit the shelves yet, but I've been playing a lot of that lately as well.

486
00:50:45,982 --> 00:50:48,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So something Guitar Hero related is coming to Video Games Live.

487
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:54,884
[SPEAKER_00]: An interactive segment with Guitar Hero and Stephen Tyler from Aerosmith.

488
00:50:54,924 --> 00:50:57,144
[SPEAKER_00]: His real name is Stephen Tallarico.

489
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,144
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my cousin.

490
00:50:59,705 --> 00:51:10,307
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been always talking about doing something together and ended up getting them hooked up with Activision to get that product on the market the first time ever.

491
00:51:11,147 --> 00:51:37,528
[SPEAKER_00]: A band has its own music video game with Guitar Hero, so we're all really proud of that Wouldn't it be cool if somebody could come up on stage and play a song from Guitar Hero Aerosmith While playing along on the big screen with the orchestra And with some live musicians on stage as well, wouldn't that be cool?

492
00:51:37,776 --> 00:51:46,503
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome, and thankfully it's Aerosmith and not that Dragon Force song from Guitar Hero 3, because then I'd be, I think we'd all like, you know, I would want to lose in front of all those people.

493
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Aerosmith I think I could probably handle, I know those songs pretty well.

494
00:51:51,807 --> 00:52:06,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Tommy Tallarico, the man behind Video Games Live, the man behind Gang, and the soundtrack to so many video games, thank you so much for spending the time tonight here on Orange Launch Radio, talking about everything, and best of luck to you through the next few dates of your tour.

495
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:24,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, and I really appreciate you taking the time to help spread the word because I think what you guys are doing are so important to us and the growth of this thing, and talking about it really helps us out in helping to spread the word.

496
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

497
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,168
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem, Tommy.

498
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:27,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck to you.

499
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:29,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.

500
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much to Tommy for taking the time to talk to us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

501
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:36,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.

502
00:52:36,162 --> 00:52:40,783
[SPEAKER_04]: He's pretty chatty, but a lot of really insightful information about how the whole process works.

503
00:52:40,903 --> 00:52:43,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny because I didn't believe it when he said it.

504
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:48,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Steven Tyler's last name is actually Tallarico.

505
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:50,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of thought it was a joke when I first heard it too.

506
00:52:50,426 --> 00:52:52,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I didn't follow up on that at all.

507
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:53,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it is true.

508
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:58,048
[SPEAKER_04]: He is actually related to Steven Tyler, which means he's also related to Liv Tyler.

509
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:01,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

510
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

511
00:53:02,475 --> 00:53:02,735
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

512
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:04,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can be related.

513
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:06,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just kind of neat.

514
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:08,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of thought he was joking.

515
00:53:08,497 --> 00:53:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh yeah, he's my bro, he's my cousin, you know, that type of thing.

516
00:53:12,078 --> 00:53:13,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just very surprised.

517
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:18,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so funny because, you know, Loki exclaims something like, if it's not on Wikipedia, it's not true.

518
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he went to Wikipedia and I just heard, oh.

519
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:23,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it is true.

520
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,791
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, we got some more gaming news to cover.

521
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:32,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys on Skype are eager to call in, so we want to get to you guys as well.

522
00:53:32,315 --> 00:53:34,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few more stories for you guys quick, though.

523
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:35,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off with Loki.

524
00:53:35,357 --> 00:53:38,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, last week, you know, the PSP got firmware 4.0.

525
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:51,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course, they couldn't leave it just like that, so they put out 4.01, which, you know, is just, I guess, to make sure that 4.0 was working correctly and updates as far as...

526
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:56,174
[SPEAKER_05]: They improved some of the search features, I guess.

527
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it.

528
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:06,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if they were trying to stop the homebrew stuff, but pretty much the very next day, the custom firmware 4.01 was released.

529
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:09,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, PKJr92 in chat says, 4.01 is a joke.

530
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:10,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like 9-1-1 is a joke.

531
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:11,359
[SPEAKER_04]: 4.01 is a joke.

532
00:54:11,379 --> 00:54:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that could be a hit new song.

533
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:24,684
[SPEAKER_04]: 4.01 is a joke.

534
00:54:26,605 --> 00:54:27,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a joke.

535
00:54:27,385 --> 00:54:31,547
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole annoying digital rights management thing on the Xbox Live.

536
00:54:31,587 --> 00:54:32,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

537
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:34,428
[SPEAKER_04]: They have finally fixed it.

538
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:42,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a new DRM tool, digital rights management tool, that is available on Xbox site, on the Microsoft site.

539
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:48,616
[SPEAKER_04]: This is originally going to be a part of the next patch or the next release, but it's actually available now.

540
00:54:48,656 --> 00:54:50,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available on Xbox.com.

541
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:55,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You can manage the digital rights contents of arcade titles that you've downloaded and so on.

542
00:54:55,702 --> 00:55:00,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used this myself, but I should because my original Xbox 360 died of the Red Rings of Death.

543
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:06,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have this awkward digital management thing with Geometry Wars and Joust, which were the first two arcade titles I ever bought.

544
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:07,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should go in and try to fix that.

545
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:12,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you don't have to go through this whole mess of getting the points credited back to you and all this stuff.

546
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,990
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you can see the three-step process here.

547
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you've signed into Xbox Live with this account, or whatever your name is.

548
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:21,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the Xbox Live Marketplace and select Account Management, Download History.

549
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:24,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Select an item and then select Download Again.

550
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Repeat Step 3 for each item in your download history.

551
00:55:28,703 --> 00:55:28,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I win.

552
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:29,964
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you win?

553
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I win a story.

554
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:31,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And what would this story be about?

555
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:59,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, everyone knows that one of the coolest voice actors in the world, in my opinion anyway, is David Hayter.

556
00:55:59,712 --> 00:56:04,777
[SPEAKER_07]: He has written movies, done a fairly good job with the first X-Men movie.

557
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:08,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, with the first two X-Men movies since he did the screenplays.

558
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:16,967
[SPEAKER_07]: But he is actually looking for a petition out to get all of the fans to sign so that he writes the Metal Gear movie.

559
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:19,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

560
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:27,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, honestly, I would have to think that he would know Snake better than just about anybody except maybe Kojima.

561
00:56:27,455 --> 00:56:30,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some of the other people on Kojima's team.

562
00:56:31,197 --> 00:56:43,525
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think, though, that when you're the person who puts the personality into the character, I think that you would have a bit of insight into how to properly write for that character.

563
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's pretty cool.

564
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of writing creds does he have?

565
00:56:54,184 --> 00:56:58,990
[SPEAKER_07]: He wrote the screenplays for the first two X-Men movies.

566
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,753
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing an adaptation of Watchmen.

567
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:14,189
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's actually looking to have everyone actually email a rep at Sony Pictures.

568
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:19,893
[SPEAKER_07]: The address is, and I'm going to go ahead and say it on the air because honestly I would love for him to write the movie.

569
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:21,434
[SPEAKER_07]: He does a good job.

570
00:57:22,115 --> 00:57:30,260
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's Matt, M-A-T-T underscore T-O-L-M-A-C-H at S-P-E dot Sony dot com.

571
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:32,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So send those emails in.

572
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:34,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually use good grammar, please.

573
00:57:34,442 --> 00:57:35,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Spell check for the win.

574
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:39,464
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really good opportunity for us to try and get David Hayter on the show.

575
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:40,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

576
00:57:40,845 --> 00:57:41,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to email.

577
00:57:41,405 --> 00:57:42,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see if I can get an email.

578
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:44,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You realize I'm going to be sitting in the corner fangasming the whole time.

579
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:46,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanning yourself.

580
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:47,827
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually really good looking, too.

581
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to see what we can do about that.

582
00:57:49,828 --> 00:57:56,511
[SPEAKER_05]: In a reference to the video that we saw the other day, and no one else will get, Blurred Fluids.

583
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's going to understand that.

584
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:01,109
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube joke.

585
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:03,531
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say here?

586
00:58:03,932 --> 00:58:05,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments here in the chat room.

587
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:08,335
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight says as long as he plays him.

588
00:58:11,135 --> 00:58:11,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

589
00:58:35,925 --> 00:59:02,758
[SPEAKER_05]: but iTunes has a similar policy I think you can reset your iTunes digital rights management like once a year as well but of course then again you can also install the music on like four different computers something like that awesome well remember there was a big to do about the whole hot coffee crap in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and then there was a settlement where people could possibly get money for not even having purchased Grand Theft Auto but you know

590
00:59:03,424 --> 00:59:05,445
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to pretend that you did.

591
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:09,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the response to the whole thing was really only 2,676 claims.

592
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:10,087
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't say 26,000, right?

593
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:10,307
[SPEAKER_05]: You said 2,000.

594
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:10,307
2,676.

595
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:13,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many people bought Grand Theft Auto?

596
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:13,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Approximately 12 million.

597
00:59:13,649 --> 00:59:13,809
[SPEAKER_05]: 11 billion?

598
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:33,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So that apparently is approximately 0.022% of the consumers that actually were offended and upset from the content in the game.

599
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:37,411
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, people looking for a free lunch, courtesy of Take-Two from McDonald's.

600
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:38,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And essentially that...

601
00:59:38,852 --> 00:59:39,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

602
00:59:39,393 --> 00:59:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, just wow.

603
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:05,332
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had the stupid award music still queued, I'd probably play it right about now.

604
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:10,816
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, I left that in Part A. Everyone was complaining that it was such a big deal and everyone was making a big deal.

605
01:00:11,056 --> 01:00:14,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who that .22% or .022% was?

606
01:00:14,899 --> 01:00:16,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Thompson and his family.

607
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:19,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And just people blowing the shit out of proportion.

608
01:00:19,062 --> 01:00:20,544
[SPEAKER_04]: People wanted to see if it worked or not.

609
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:24,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, out of those 2,000, how many just wanted to see if it would work?

610
01:00:25,648 --> 01:00:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm curious about.

611
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:27,249
[SPEAKER_04]: If they got money.

612
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:28,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody in our chat room do it?

613
01:00:29,591 --> 01:00:30,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

614
01:00:30,683 --> 01:00:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Einhander and Xenogears are now going to be on the PlayStation Network.

615
01:00:33,264 --> 01:00:34,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Einhander.

616
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:34,705
[SPEAKER_04]: We still need Zweihander.

617
01:00:57,896 --> 01:01:01,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised Xenogears is on there since I think it's a multiple disc game.

618
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, you know, they've got a lot of storage space on that PlayStation 3, you know.

619
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:10,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, you can now download these songs.

620
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:12,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download these games on the PlayStation Network.

621
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And there you have it.

622
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:16,354
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being sold right now in Japan.

623
01:01:16,454 --> 01:01:17,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, you can't do it here.

624
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:18,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being sold for 600 yen apiece.

625
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:19,396
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about $5.56.

626
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:19,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

627
01:01:22,284 --> 01:01:22,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Money Talks, people.

628
01:01:22,924 --> 01:01:23,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Money Talks.

629
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:46,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

630
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:47,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?

631
01:01:47,962 --> 01:01:48,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

632
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey everyone!

633
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what you were doing last night.

634
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you were doing last night too, tell us about it.

635
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:23,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you did last night.

636
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, besides getting drunk with Freeze Pop.

637
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:35,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, so when you say that, you don't mean you were actually getting drunk at a Freeze Pop concert, although that is probably true as well.

638
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:38,469
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually went out and got drunk with Freeze Pop the band.

639
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is what actually happened.

640
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell the story.

641
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:52,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a room party having a good time, and I left, you know, to bring some more alcohol up, and I was going up the stairs, and I saw them, and the girl, I think her name was Elizabeth, she said, is there a party going on?

642
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:54,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, follow me.

643
01:02:55,744 --> 01:03:03,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow me right into the party, and we've been partying ever since, and right now I'm actually downloading all the pictures from the party with them as we speak.

644
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:06,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you remind them that OLR loves them muchly?

645
01:03:07,745 --> 01:03:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes I did, in between shots.

646
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:09,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

647
01:03:11,657 --> 01:03:12,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt they even remember us.

648
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one of them came on the show, but you never know.

649
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:17,279
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you just list?

650
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:18,099
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole band or what?

651
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,220
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole band.

652
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

653
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

654
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:22,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing shots with the band.

655
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:26,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they happen to let slip any things they might have coming up in the game world?

656
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:28,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I read recently one of their emails that went out to everybody.

657
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:34,625
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a little bit of freeze pop controversy about the fact that their song I Am Not Your Game Boy is on Guitar Hero DS.

658
01:03:35,426 --> 01:03:38,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's actually not by Harmonix anymore, right?

659
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:38,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And so

660
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to kind of clear the air that, hey, they're loaning their songs out to, you know.

661
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:49,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, no, the deal was that, I think if I remember right reading on their site, they don't get paid when they're in the Harmonix games.

662
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They do it just, you know, for the love of Harmonix, for the love of those games.

663
01:03:52,830 --> 01:04:01,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were getting paid by Konami when it was in DDR, by Sony, you know, branded games, and by, you know, the folks who did Guitar Hero on tour.

664
01:04:04,113 --> 01:04:06,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little freeze-pop controversy I thought I'd clear up.

665
01:04:07,383 --> 01:04:08,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they really are talented.

666
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:11,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after seeing them a second time, it was really awesome.

667
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:16,066
[SPEAKER_02]: They really deserve more, you know what I'm saying?

668
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're destined for stardom eventually.

669
01:04:19,787 --> 01:04:22,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows some of their songs from Rock Band and all that stuff.

670
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:27,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did a new song at the concert.

671
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

672
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:32,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they covered a popular song from the 80s as an encore song.

673
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:32,792
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

674
01:04:33,632 --> 01:04:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The Final Countdown.

675
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:35,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

676
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:39,802
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely keytar friendly.

677
01:04:42,062 --> 01:04:42,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

678
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:43,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you never know.

679
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:44,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 2, maybe?

680
01:04:44,684 --> 01:04:45,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

681
01:04:46,605 --> 01:04:47,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, here's the thing, though.

682
01:04:47,506 --> 01:04:54,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time you go drinking with Liz, since now you have her number in your black book or whatever, tell them that OLR would love a new theme song.

683
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:59,614
[SPEAKER_04]: No disrespect to Middie Head, but we've been using the opening song now for like two years, so we're looking for something new.

684
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:01,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a thought.

685
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:03,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be able to do something.

686
01:05:03,637 --> 01:05:06,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody that knows somebody, so I may be able to cash in a favor or something.

687
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:07,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I would love you forever.

688
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,321
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what else is going on in your world?

689
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to update our listeners on real quick?

690
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:14,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, are you ready to drink this weekend?

691
01:05:14,868 --> 01:05:16,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's right, you're coming to town.

692
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't drink.

693
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:18,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I can drink cider and milk.

694
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll drink cider with you.

695
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, your cider will probably be special cider.

696
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:27,513
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get the Blackthorn for us.

697
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:35,296
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm looking forward to you being in town, and I'm looking forward to the Fourth of July party when we're going to set things on fire.

698
01:05:35,756 --> 01:05:36,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

699
01:05:37,574 --> 01:05:38,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Rob.

700
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:38,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

701
01:05:39,496 --> 01:05:40,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a surprise for you.

702
01:05:40,877 --> 01:05:41,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, I like surprises.

703
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to present it next week if I can be on the show.

704
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:46,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you can be on the show.

705
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:47,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were already coming to the show.

706
01:05:48,964 --> 01:05:50,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to make sure, you know.

707
01:05:50,986 --> 01:05:53,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ranma will be here in studio next week.

708
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,501
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so until then, I'm hanging up on you because you have all next week to talk to us.

709
01:05:58,282 --> 01:05:58,883
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then.

710
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:00,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, Ranma.

711
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:02,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

712
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:03,347
[SPEAKER_04]: That is next week, isn't it?

713
01:06:03,387 --> 01:06:04,308
[SPEAKER_04]: God, time flies.

714
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:08,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That means I have to do... I'm going to be busy this week.

715
01:06:08,152 --> 01:06:09,334
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to clean the house.

716
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I already... My house is pretty clean.

717
01:06:13,298 --> 01:06:14,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to change the cat litter.

718
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay over there, Loki?

719
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:19,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm just frustrated getting this working.

720
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:20,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard myself.

721
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

722
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:23,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

723
01:06:23,982 --> 01:06:24,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It's J-Rod.

724
01:06:24,883 --> 01:06:25,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, J-Rod.

725
01:06:25,463 --> 01:06:26,104
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

726
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:31,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just asking you guys, what are you looking forward to for E3 the most?

727
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:32,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right around the corner.

728
01:06:33,194 --> 01:06:34,615
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I looking forward to E3 the most?

729
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:39,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, me personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how much of Microsoft's press conference really did get spoiled.

730
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:40,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

731
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:42,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to all the press conferences.

732
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I love sitting there not working and reading the press conferences.

733
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:50,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I really am looking forward to seeing if Animal Crossing MMO or Wii or whatever.

734
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing if it is true that Animal Crossing is coming back to Nintendo and what they're doing with it.

735
01:06:55,969 --> 01:07:23,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so freaking curious it's killing me and of course I want Nintendo to address the space issues so I gotta say Nintendo's press conference I'm definitely looking forward to Sony I don't know what I'm looking forward to hearing from Sony but sometimes they really surprise you out of left field so I don't think you can predict Sony Microsoft if the rumors are true they're gonna have an interesting press conference ahead of them I'm also looking forward to seeing how the absence of these companies is gonna play into the E3 reports this year with all these companies dropping out

736
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, DarkSakura, anything you want to add?

737
01:07:26,654 --> 01:07:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they'll just have pretty much Activision, so since they're not going to be there, they'll probably have their own little press conference that'll take place at the same time.

738
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it'll pretty much be the same damn coverage.

739
01:07:37,161 --> 01:07:37,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true.

740
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think that they made a mistake with cutting out the fanfare.

741
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:44,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that they should have been a bit more discerning as to invitations.

742
01:07:44,707 --> 01:07:45,107
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

743
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:49,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Very disappointing, but have you looked at the Penny Arcade exhibitor list?

744
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:51,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I'm happy about.

745
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:52,803
[SPEAKER_07]: That's doing it right.

746
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:54,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear something that really would piss you off?

747
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:59,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so my company got one invite to E3, and they said, oh, forget it, we're not going.

748
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:01,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you fuckers.

749
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:03,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you fucking whores.

750
01:08:04,676 --> 01:08:06,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, J-Rod, I'm turning the tables a little bit.

751
01:08:06,697 --> 01:08:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you looking forward to seeing at E3?

752
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:11,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I am looking forward to Gears of War 2.

753
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:18,683
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my main game for this year, is Gears of War 2, and I want to see how the new Silent Hill is turning out.

754
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:20,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of iffy about that one.

755
01:08:20,423 --> 01:08:27,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, and I haven't seen this myself, but a buddy was telling me about this, that apparently the first 10 minutes of the game are out there on the internet, and it looks pretty good.

756
01:08:28,788 --> 01:08:30,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't want to spoil anything.

757
01:08:30,028 --> 01:08:31,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to pass on that.

758
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

759
01:09:11,371 --> 01:09:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, J-Rod, thanks so much for the call.

760
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:14,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share really quickly?

761
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:15,152
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

762
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:16,212
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, have a good one.

763
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:17,992
[SPEAKER_01]: This phone call is brought to you by the Olive Garden.

764
01:09:18,212 --> 01:09:18,932
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

765
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:19,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

766
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:20,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the Olive Garden.

767
01:09:20,913 --> 01:09:21,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I had Italian today.

768
01:09:22,193 --> 01:09:22,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you?

769
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:24,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I had Mary's Pizza Shack.

770
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:26,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you couldn't have pizza.

771
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't, but they have pasta dishes there, and there was a pasta dish with marinara, because I can usually have light marinara pastas.

772
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:35,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was good times.

773
01:09:35,996 --> 01:09:37,056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I better hang up on J-Rod.

774
01:09:37,196 --> 01:09:37,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

775
01:09:37,816 --> 01:09:38,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

776
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you really want to hear us talk about Italian food the whole time?

777
01:09:42,206 --> 01:09:44,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Osfer says, I saw a trailer for the new Silent Hill.

778
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:45,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked really scary.

779
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:46,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

780
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:53,497
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not that many games I'm excited about right now, but that Silent Hill 5 is one of them.

781
01:09:53,517 --> 01:09:55,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game is supposed to be out sooner rather than later.

782
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So we shall see very soon.

783
01:09:58,882 --> 01:09:59,363
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

784
01:09:59,383 --> 01:10:00,744
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do one more call?

785
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:01,845
[SPEAKER_04]: One more quick call?

786
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:02,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

787
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:03,086
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

788
01:10:03,727 --> 01:10:04,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

789
01:10:04,628 --> 01:10:04,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

790
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:11,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Sounds Radio.

791
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:13,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Echo 1, 2, 3.

792
01:10:13,557 --> 01:10:15,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it that hard?

793
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:17,738
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

794
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:19,679
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

795
01:10:19,699 --> 01:10:20,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We're closing the Skype line.

796
01:10:23,641 --> 01:10:25,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't deal with the lack of Echo 1, 2, 3 tonight.

797
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:26,742
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

798
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:29,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's going to do it.

799
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:30,503
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go around and wrap it up.

800
01:10:31,243 --> 01:10:32,624
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we've got to get some last-minute stories.

801
01:10:32,904 --> 01:10:33,985
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you have a last-minute story?

802
01:10:34,045 --> 01:10:34,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you giggling over there.

803
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:37,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just in a giggle mood.

804
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

805
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:39,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I am.

806
01:10:39,656 --> 01:10:40,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be happy.

807
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not allowed.

808
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:44,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I can be as happy as I want to be, Rob.

809
01:10:44,761 --> 01:10:48,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to whine so that you have to put up with it.

810
01:10:48,785 --> 01:10:49,366
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

811
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:49,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Neener.

812
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have any last minute stories?

813
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:52,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a story.

814
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:53,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You did?

815
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:53,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

816
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:55,152
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then read it.

817
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop your bitching.

818
01:10:59,515 --> 01:11:05,459
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a story that Sauce gave me like an hour ago or so.

819
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:13,284
[SPEAKER_07]: That AppleCore has given the okay for a computer game to be released based on the Beatles.

820
01:11:15,326 --> 01:11:16,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Since they own the master recordings.

821
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:17,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

822
01:11:18,168 --> 01:11:18,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

823
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:19,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

824
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:27,359
[SPEAKER_07]: and they are trying to decide who's going to get it and they are between Activision and MTV Games.

825
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:28,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

826
01:11:31,603 --> 01:11:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that for real?

827
01:11:33,284 --> 01:11:34,205
[SPEAKER_04]: That is crazy.

828
01:11:34,385 --> 01:11:34,766
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

829
01:11:35,106 --> 01:11:35,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

830
01:11:35,706 --> 01:11:37,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, have any last minute stories?

831
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

832
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,172
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

833
01:11:42,192 --> 01:11:42,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

834
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:42,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

835
01:11:43,017 --> 01:11:43,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

836
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:46,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I haven't been looking at last-minute stories.

837
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been working on other stuff.

838
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:48,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

839
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:54,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Catwoman's going to be in Marvel vs. DC Universe, and she has a lot of cleavage, apparently.

840
01:11:55,326 --> 01:11:55,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise.

841
01:11:56,867 --> 01:12:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw mentions in chatroom, by the way, Sky, you know that Bill Gates officially retired?

842
01:12:01,571 --> 01:12:01,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

843
01:12:01,871 --> 01:12:06,795
[SPEAKER_04]: But he'll still always be kind of like a mascot of sorts to that company, don't you think?

844
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:09,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he's gone, but he's not.

845
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:09,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

846
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:13,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't he drop out of high school and start his own company?

847
01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:15,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

848
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:16,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Just takes dedication.

849
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:17,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

850
01:12:18,145 --> 01:12:19,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Just takes dedication.

851
01:12:19,746 --> 01:12:20,767
[SPEAKER_07]: He dropped out of college.

852
01:12:20,807 --> 01:12:21,227
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

853
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:21,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

854
01:12:22,468 --> 01:12:23,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so did I. And look at me.

855
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:26,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on the internet with a radio program with my friends.

856
01:12:26,331 --> 01:12:26,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

857
01:12:27,652 --> 01:12:28,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Winners don't use drugs.

858
01:12:29,033 --> 01:12:29,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

859
01:12:29,674 --> 01:12:31,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

860
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:33,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

861
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:36,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate PHP.

862
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:51,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my final thought is I really want another piece of ice cream cake because the one I cheated with on my birthday and had was really, really, really fucking good.

863
01:12:52,222 --> 01:12:53,523
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

864
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want some creme brulee right now.

865
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:58,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my fucking god, creme brulee is the shit.

866
01:12:58,506 --> 01:13:01,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go get some creme brulee ice cream, I think.

867
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:04,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we are Orange Lounge Foodio, I have to mention real quick.

868
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:06,745
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our first mention of food tonight.

869
01:13:07,546 --> 01:13:08,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Olive Garden.

870
01:13:08,146 --> 01:13:09,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did have Olive Garden.

871
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:09,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

872
01:13:09,948 --> 01:13:12,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that Claim Jumper now has a healthy menu?

873
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they?

874
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:16,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Food under 600 calories a dish or something?

875
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:17,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Under 600 calories a dish.

876
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Half a day food, right?

877
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,015
[SPEAKER_04]: For them, that's really good.

878
01:13:21,956 --> 01:13:24,198
[SPEAKER_07]: A bowl of soup and some of their garlic toast is under 600.

879
01:13:24,398 --> 01:13:28,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but now they have salads and stuff that are really good and under 600 calories.

880
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:28,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

881
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,626
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

882
01:13:31,886 --> 01:13:32,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but they're really good.

883
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:33,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they have the creme brulee.

884
01:13:33,767 --> 01:13:37,149
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like a new dessert dish that's three of different flavors of creme brulee.

885
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:38,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the green tea and all that stuff.

886
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:40,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And the little tiny dishes.

887
01:13:40,111 --> 01:13:40,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want?

888
01:13:40,472 --> 01:13:41,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, so.

889
01:13:41,632 --> 01:13:43,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I do kind of want, actually.

890
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:46,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I probably should be good after massively cheating on my birthday.

891
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:48,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't want to die.

892
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:52,280
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't really a last minute story, but it's interesting nonetheless.

893
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently there was a price drop on a cat skin for your Wii.

894
01:13:57,423 --> 01:14:00,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's a cute little kitten that you can put on your Wii.

895
01:14:02,085 --> 01:14:03,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I will post it in chat

896
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not DarkSakura.

897
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:35,790
[SPEAKER_04]: She's DarkSakura.

898
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:36,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Rob Roberts.

899
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: He's Loki.

900
01:14:38,092 --> 01:14:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the ferret.

901
01:14:39,172 --> 01:14:41,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

902
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:42,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see you next week.

903
01:14:42,474 --> 01:14:44,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

904
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:45,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

905
01:14:45,976 --> 01:14:48,677
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
