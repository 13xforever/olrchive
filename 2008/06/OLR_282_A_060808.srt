00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:48,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?

14
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:49,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here.

15
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:50,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You're here.

16
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:51,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You are here.

17
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:52,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever here is.

18
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is in Sacramento, California.

19
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:55,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the home base.

20
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically.

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:56,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically.

22
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,372
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not in Sacramento.

23
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're in a suburb called Rancho Cordova, but who cares?

24
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Tech Master Loki care?

25
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:04,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Our other co-host here tonight?

26
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:06,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's hot in here.

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very hot in here.

28
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:13,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it's getting to be hotter and hotter as time goes on.

29
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

30
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:15,503
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

31
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:22,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of How was your gaming week?

32
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:23,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to get into some gaming news.

33
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

34
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an EB Mania 2DX controller for $8.

35
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:31,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight whole dollars?

36
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:32,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight whole dollars.

37
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dan showed me some game called I Want to Be the Guy.

38
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:44,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a YouTube video of someone playing it, which I thought was kind of funny.

39
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:44,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like...

40
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly this really hard game that has elements from different other games in it, so I'd have to do a little bit more research.

41
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw this game a couple weeks ago.

42
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

43
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:57,965
[SPEAKER_06]: To say the least.

44
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:58,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

45
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:04,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And just more of the usual.

46
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

47
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:07,350
[SPEAKER_03]: More of the usual.

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Same old, same old.

49
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

50
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

51
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:13,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, more Grand Theft Auto 4.

52
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:17,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually at 98.66% of completion.

53
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:18,829
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'll be done with it.

54
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad it's not 98.666 because that would be funny.

55
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:22,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

56
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see here.

57
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:32,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I've been playing actually a little bit of some different stuff.

58
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:38,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried some things last night over at my mom's house during Nelly's birthday barbecue.

59
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:38,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We...

60
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:45,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Try it a little bit, very, very little bit of Dancing with the Stars.

61
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That game sucked balls, so we immediately turned that off.

62
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:56,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually played quite a bit of Defend Your Castle, and that game, and I think with four people, that game would be a lot of fun.

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I was only playing it with my sister, though, but...

64
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,832
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

65
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:25,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the controls of it are very similar to Excite Truck.

66
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:50,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually hold the remote either flat with the buttons facing up kind of like Excite Truck or you can put it in the Wii wheel and have the buttons facing towards you and you can actually calibrate that by the very beginning of the game they actually ask you to hold the controller horizontal and you hit the 2 button on there and that will basically cause you to

67
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:53,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Calibrate it, either way.

68
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty awesome.

69
00:04:54,266 --> 00:05:08,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how they do that, because a lot of these games now are using the Wii wheel, and so it's forcing you to keep the buttons towards you, and that's fine if you're using the Wii wheel, but if you're not, it really contorts your wrist when you're trying to play it, and it kind of hurts after a while, which kind of sucks.

70
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing...

71
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the game itself is pretty fun.

72
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:16,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually quite a bit like Wipeout, a little bit like F-Zero.

73
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,786
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics could be a little bit better, but overall, it's fun.

74
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:24,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do all the Car-Fu stuff in there, and very intuitive controls, and I don't know.

75
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, Nelly is calling this her next Excite Truck game.

76
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:29,974
[SPEAKER_04]: She is literally playing this at home right now.

77
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,476
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big endorsement from the wife who usually hates video games.

78
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:37,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and I've tried finding a suitable replacement for Excite Truck, and

79
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Have failed so far until now, but I think it's pretty cool.

80
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:52,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish this game had come out on a different platform, like say the 360 or PlayStation 3, because the movie was so pretty, and the game is just kind of, it's all right.

81
00:05:54,369 --> 00:06:18,816
[SPEAKER_04]: but a couple things you may have noticed if you've ever seen any of the trailer videos on this that there's a lot of kind of silhouette pop-ups that come up and they like say a little one-liner thing and then they pop away and it does that very frequently you can turn those off so if that's annoying because I know a lot of people are like well what the fuck that's really stupid looking you can turn all that stuff off so that's really cool but that's about it yeah it's fun game though

82
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:21,984
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

83
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:48,296
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

84
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:07,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Defend Your Castle.

85
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:08,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a WiiWare game.

86
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:10,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played much Wii lately.

87
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to show it to you at some point.

88
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,101
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

89
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's based on an old, old Flash game.

90
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:17,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's called the same thing, Defend Your Castle.

91
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:18,387
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar.

92
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,529
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was much bloodier in the Flash version.

93
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,594
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to, you know, Wii-itize it or whatever you want to call it.

94
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the style.

95
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:35,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you notice, also, just like that gummy car game or whatever they had, it's all done with the guy's voice.

96
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:37,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I love it.

97
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:38,099
[SPEAKER_03]: His voice is great.

98
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the music in the game.

99
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

100
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Games I played this week, lots and lots of World of Warcraft because I'm kind of addicted.

101
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did check out a couple of the new arcade games on Xbox Live.

102
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: These are demos only, so I'm really basing my opinion off demos, which, you know, just kind of a disclaimer there.

103
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:59,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Ace of the Galaxy, I don't know.

104
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it for a little while.

105
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:01,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of interesting.

106
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:08,027
[SPEAKER_03]: The shooting style of it reminded me a little bit of Rez, where you could, like, lock onto things and let all your bullets go off at once.

107
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:12,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I go, you know, I'm kind of playing it, and I'm just like, I just want to play Rez.

108
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play a game like this.

109
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,675
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

110
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:33,735
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

111
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:57,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn these little disks as fast as you can to make sure the shapes, as they fall, fall through the right shape.

112
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:01,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember that old, old game like we had in elementary school called Perfection?

113
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:07,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you had to put those little shapes in the right holes before, pop, they all pop out, like, remember, before the board explodes?

114
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:08,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

115
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:08,995
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever play that game?

116
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:10,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I the only one that played that?

117
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:10,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to play it.

118
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was awesome.

119
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:12,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank God.

120
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:12,595
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

121
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:14,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like that.

122
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:21,557
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure you turn the disks so that a star shape throws to the star hole repeatedly or else the galaxy blows up.

123
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:23,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically.

124
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:25,097
[SPEAKER_03]: In a nutshell.

125
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:39,020
[SPEAKER_03]: But I couldn't figure out how was this game going to... I mean, granted, as it was going along, it added more shapes, and it got a little harder, and you had to squash these aliens by speeding the bricks up, but it was still about reaction time.

126
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of like, where is the puzzle game in this?

127
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,881
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a puzzle game here, the demo totally neglected to show it to me.

128
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:47,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, if there's objects falling down on a screen, it's a puzzle game.

129
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:49,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, but not to me.

130
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't very impressed.

131
00:09:54,483 --> 00:10:00,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a darn shame because the graphics and previews for the future levels made it look like more exciting things were to come.

132
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:01,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

133
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll have to look it up on the internet and see if there's videos of future levels that make the game more interesting.

134
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, it did hold my attention.

135
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, whee, rotating discs is fun.

136
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:10,732
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is easy.

137
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it could get lots of achievement points.

138
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, like, when the demo was over, I was like, that's it?

139
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:15,955
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

140
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two new games I played this week.

141
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:22,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I've been playing more Audio Surface.

142
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:24,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that game's pretty rad.

143
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about that on last week's show, if you missed that.

144
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:31,731
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here shortly, but I also want to introduce the one and only chat room.

145
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:34,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

146
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:38,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo in chat says, Rugu equals the baby toy for adults.

147
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:39,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

148
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:43,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo also says, Rugu equals boring a lot.

149
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ Mix has been playing a lot of Wii in his week.

150
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:52,382
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been playing Dr. Mario on WiiWare, Battalion Wars Wii, Bomberman Live on Wii, and Mario Paint on the Super Nintendo.

151
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:53,603
[SPEAKER_03]: That's old school.

152
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:56,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody checked out Dr. Mario on WiiWare yet?

153
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:59,669
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of those games I keep like, I need to get it, but I have no space!

154
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,253
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is just like, remember how Nintendo said, oh, we have 100 WiiWare games in development.

155
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:07,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're all gonna be fucking old clones of shit.

156
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:08,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're gonna put Dr. Mario out there.

157
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put

158
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,142
[SPEAKER_03]: But, hold on, to be fair, Nintendo is the master.

159
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:14,143
[SPEAKER_03]: No one does it better.

160
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:17,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again.

161
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Case in point, Mario All-Stars on Super Nintendo.

162
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Who didn't love that game?

163
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was like the upgraded versions of the old Mario games.

164
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again.

165
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do a good job of it.

166
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that was a little fanboyish statement, but they do...

167
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:37,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to ask about this before we get into housekeeping tonight.

168
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:40,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to address why there's been changes on JustinTV.

169
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:41,752
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that in a minute.

170
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:43,453
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I want to ask Loki.

171
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:44,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki ran through the door.

172
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I'm gonna be late, there's food problems.

173
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

174
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I forgot to put the breadsticks in.

175
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so they put them in, but they only put in half of my order.

176
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I forgot to put the other half in.

177
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'm just sitting there and... Nice.

178
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:49,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy, you know, up front, working cash register, had his mouth open, kind of drooling there.

179
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And some guy's like, um, is my pizza ready?

180
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:57,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I called it in, he said it was going to be 20 minutes, and it's been 25.

181
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:57,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

182
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So, can you check on it?

183
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:09,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she said that it's going to be about five minutes once you've ordered it.

184
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:10,694
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?

185
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:11,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

186
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, they just put it in.

187
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:16,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you go check on that?

188
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,379
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just stupid to stand in there.

189
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:24,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how food emergencies are a valid excuse here at Orange Lawn Studio for making a person wait.

190
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I had plenty of time.

191
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:31,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with a slight delay, I would have still been here on time.

192
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:34,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like fucking 40 minutes for breadsticks.

193
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit takes like two minutes to make.

194
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:37,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

195
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Justin TV and housekeeping tonight.

196
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,225
[SPEAKER_03]: We've changed a little bit over on Justin TV.

197
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:42,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what happened.

198
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:48,046
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to run through an iSight webcam and my little Mac laptop.

199
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:55,368
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to run the webcam that way, but the iSight got broken due to my stupidness, and it no longer runs audio through it.

200
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happened is that this past week, I actually got a video camera because I've been wanting a video camera anyway, so...

201
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Just figured two birds with one stone.

202
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a video camera and we're going to use it for Justin.TV as well.

203
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what you see hooked up tonight.

204
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:09,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have now a video camera running on Justin.TV.

205
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,993
[SPEAKER_03]: However, here's why the resolution is crappy.

206
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for some reason, even though the old Justin.TV broadcaster used to support 640x480 on the USB capture device, it no longer does that.

207
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,057
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

208
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,441
[SPEAKER_03]: All we have to do is make a little switch just like this.

209
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:21,173
[SPEAKER_03]: and you guys won't hear this on the podcast but they'll see it on Justin TV you can actually go to live video of gameplay and playing right now on Justin TV is our old favorite 8-bit classic The Guardian Legend a little screenshot from there and you'll be able to see us kind of switch back and forth so we can actually like if we talk about games and we happen to have them up we can switch just that easily

210
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:27,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's the other problem, is that on Justin TV just then, their audio completely cut out.

211
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,673
[SPEAKER_03]: They only got the audio of the game.

212
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't hear us talking over that.

213
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the other thing we've got to fix, but we're working on it.

214
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:40,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting things to come on Justin TV, but since you guys have been crying the past few weeks, like, where's the webcam gone?

215
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:42,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to show you we've made some progress.

216
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:44,105
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying.

217
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,347
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a non-profit organization here at Orange Lounge Radio.

218
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

219
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:49,189
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

220
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:55,358
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so anyhow, let's get into tonight's gaming news, shall we?

221
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,922
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's no other housekeeping tonight, the only other thing I can think of is the old plugs for our communities.

222
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:06,908
[SPEAKER_03]: We love to add people on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio, on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge, or our Facebook community, the OL Army.

223
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:09,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to tonight's gaming news, Loki.

224
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,852
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the Orange Lounge Wiki at Wikia.

225
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:13,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that thing is awesome, too.

226
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,795
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how awesome our community is.

227
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I put out a call on the forums this week.

228
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, hi, I don't know anything about editing wikis.

229
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:22,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not very good at it at all.

230
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the wiki language.

231
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I think wiki is a wonderful concept.

232
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to take my lazy ass and sit it down for a while and learn wiki.

233
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:32,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But the front page on the wiki right now isn't working for me.

234
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find things.

235
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:36,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Can someone please clean up the front page within 24 hours?

236
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:37,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great.

237
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

238
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:49,635
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

239
00:16:49,856 --> 00:17:11,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is a rumor that never seems to die, but CrunchGear, a tech blog, is actually reporting that an inside source at Microsoft, who was a former member of the company's HD DVD department, has confirmed that the company will announce that the Xbox 360 will get Blu-ray before Christmas via a press release that's set to go out tomorrow morning around 9, 10-ish.

240
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:11,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

241
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:21,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the system, they don't really have any info on it right now, but it says it will cost less than an elite system.

242
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know, this still seems far-fetched, but I guess we'll just have to wait until tomorrow morning now, won't we?

243
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:35,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, which will be today by the time this show goes out.

244
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:40,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, either we were really smart in saying this in advance or we're dumb.

245
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:45,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems like this rumor is always going around that Microsoft is going to be announcing Blu-ray.

246
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,061
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes this special?

247
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:54,146
[SPEAKER_04]: All I think that they're going to be doing with this is just releasing another external thing that's going to have, you know, just like the HD DVD player.

248
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:56,159
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

249
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:24,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what they're probably going to have to do with this.

250
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:29,097
[SPEAKER_04]: If they do include it inside of a 360, I think it's going to be a dumb move.

251
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:38,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, I mean, I hope they tested all this stuff to make sure that the access times are the same because otherwise you're going to have a lot of problems reading games.

252
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about this particular report though why I should believe it?

253
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:42,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

254
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:55,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those people are just... Because I think that instead of just saying, you know, oh, it's coming, it's saying, hey, there's going to be a press release tomorrow that says da-da-da-da-da at this time.

255
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot easier to say, okay, well, this is going to be true or false instead of speculating whether it's true or not.

256
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:03,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, GK128 in our chat makes an interesting observation.

257
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:07,486
[SPEAKER_03]: He says the new iPhone is supposed to be tomorrow as well, which, you know, that's...

258
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:14,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Half speculation, half Apple fanboys always figure out this stuff in advance, so they're probably right.

259
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

260
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow is the Worldwide Developers Conference.

261
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this Microsoft's answer to Apple, in a way?

262
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:24,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey, Apple's making this big unveiling, and we're going to unveil Blu-ray in the home.

263
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what maybe gives us a little weight?

264
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

265
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:27,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

266
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:27,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd just be weird.

267
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:33,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, you know, Microsoft, I mean, they're always kind of butting heads with Apple and stuff.

268
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:34,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're trying to...

269
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:38,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Get people on board with their video download service and stuff like that.

270
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:40,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

271
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:41,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And you put the nail on the head there.

272
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:44,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they want to go Blu-ray when they have their download service?

273
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but then again, alright, they have the HD DVD player.

274
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:57,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I guess when I hear about Microsoft putting out a Blu-ray player, you remember in the old Charlie Brown comics, when a character would get really upset, there'd be a little scribble drawn over their head?

275
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:04,675
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I look like when I keep thinking about how my HD DVD player, pretty much, I only have five movies I'll ever be able to watch on it now.

276
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:07,617
[SPEAKER_07]: We can still find movies all over the place, though.

277
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:08,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually really cheap.

278
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: But to know that there's no more ever coming out in some of these newer movies I might want to get.

279
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we found out they were clearing out.

280
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,001
[SPEAKER_07]: We went out and bought our player.

281
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But I bought my player full price.

282
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:23,524
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have angry, angry face.

283
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: There are always positives and negatives to adopting early.

284
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, I know.

285
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sucks.

286
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah, sucks.

287
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:32,068
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

288
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,549
[SPEAKER_06]: But keep in mind, you know.

289
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:56,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Blu-ray being now the preferred method of high definition media I'm expecting now to start seeing more of the less expensive models coming out over the next year or so so you'll have an easier time getting one into your hands all the more reason not to buy this

290
00:20:58,499 --> 00:20:58,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

291
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:02,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not going to buy the Blu-ray player because I know eventually I'm going to get a PS3.

292
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:06,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize I'm the only OLR host without a PS3, and eventually I'm going to crack and get one.

293
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:07,483
[SPEAKER_03]: You aren't missing much.

294
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:12,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right now I'm not, but Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out someday.

295
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:13,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how we think.

296
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a Final Fantasy fanboy.

297
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:18,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be the first to admit when it comes out, I have no choice.

298
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:19,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I must upgrade to PS3.

299
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:22,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if the game sucks, it's Final Fantasy.

300
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to get it.

301
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the same thing for Final Fantasy VII.

302
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:49,144
[SPEAKER_03]: and I held out on getting a Sony Playstation for the longest time until Final Fantasy 7 came out and then I finally caved and bought one and I'm glad I did because you guys all know tons and tons of classic games on the Playstation I hope the Playstation 3 has a similar legacy but I don't know we'll see Ranma in chat agrees Rob you're not missing anything hey before we get to the next story I missed one housekeeping thing I'm such a jerk

303
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:50,407
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Tetsuya

304
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:07,308
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

305
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure as you read, they sent me the console instead because they knew I was the appropriate owner of such a console.

306
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:40,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Lies, lies.

307
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:41,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have some good news.

308
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:44,125
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt did tie for third place.

309
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:45,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So he does get something.

310
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:46,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So that does kind of rock.

311
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations.

312
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:50,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

313
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:16,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one vote got SSJ100 Matt tied for third place because Bobby's show got like four votes.

314
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:17,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a runaway.

315
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:21,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you know which show voted for us out of everybody?

316
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby.

317
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Bobby's the only one that probably understood all the in-jokes.

318
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:30,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

319
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:33,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So the winning show voted for us.

320
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that says, but something to think about.

321
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to think about.

322
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

323
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:40,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to more news.

324
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:44,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And something else we like to think about are music-based games because you know we love them here.

325
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:48,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And lately music-based games have been all about Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

326
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And a brand new Guitar Hero game is coming out.

327
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:52,465
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard, it's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

328
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:55,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Aerosmith is scheduled to come out very soon.

329
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some songs that have been announced for the game.

330
00:23:59,149 --> 00:23:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm disappointed.

331
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:01,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Foghat Edition.

332
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:33,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Live on the Edge, Love in an Elevator, Dream On, Walk This Way, Run DMC

333
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:50,914
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the other bands you'll see.

334
00:24:51,194 --> 00:25:01,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheap Trick with Dream Police, Joan Jett, I Hate Myself for Loving You, The Clash, Complete Control, Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run and Run DMC with King of Rock.

335
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:09,646
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's some of the stuff you have to look forward to in Guitar Hero Aerosmith which is coming out for the PlayStation 3, 360 and PlayStation 2.

336
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And if just the game wasn't enough, wouldn't you know it?

337
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Bundles coming out as well.

338
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:19,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So no excuses to say you can't play this game unless you just don't like Guitar Hero or Aerosmith.

339
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:21,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Aerosmith

340
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:45,487
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura Reads The Next Story

341
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: The next story has to do with something that rather excites me.

342
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,155
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite game series ever, and I'm not saying Metal Slug, but it's Samurai Shodown.

343
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:37,264
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually said that, well, from the ESRB, that Xbox Live Arcade would be getting Samurai Shodown 2, and also now they're saying they should be getting Samurai Shodown, and it's...

344
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:46,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose they're getting them separately, but there's no news beyond what's been on the ESRB.

345
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:51,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can hope that they'll be all jazzed up and pretty.

346
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:54,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get all the Samurai Shodown games?

347
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:55,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's kind of a lot.

348
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:56,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I want five.

349
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,180
[SPEAKER_03]: What's so special about five?

350
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Five is the last cartridge that was released on the Neo Geo cart system.

351
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've never played it.

352
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:06,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want it.

353
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:10,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck it, I want Samurai Shodown HD Remix.

354
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:12,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can do Samurai Shodown 5 HD Remix.

355
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:17,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Samurai Shodown 2 though, most of all, because that one was like the best.

356
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:18,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

357
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:20,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It had caffeine nicotine.

358
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:23,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

359
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the question that we asked earlier, Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

360
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:29,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

361
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitsune says, I'm not too thrilled about the new Guitar Hero.

362
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,168
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ Mix says, it's not Guitar Hero Blink 182.

363
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:40,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitsune follows up and says, I think my husband might get it for the 360.

364
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert M says, I still can't find many of the Aerosmith songs on iTunes.

365
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, why?

366
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:49,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Guitar Hero makes it money.

367
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:54,628
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 is hoping for Guitar Hero Loki Fusion

368
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:16,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Last couple comments.

369
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:25,369
[SPEAKER_03]: GK128 says, Guitar Hero, insert band name here, will always be a rental unless it's something badass like Pixies or Dinosaur Jr., which he must be fanboys of.

370
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, make Aerosmith a download pack.

371
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:33,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And AZHP says, it'd only be worth it if you actually like Aerosmith.

372
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Aerosmith's kind of cool, though.

373
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's what I'm talking about.

374
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:38,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band has it figured out with the download packs.

375
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:42,361
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem they're going to run into with that, though, is what they do for Rock Band 2.

376
00:28:43,642 --> 00:29:05,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they could sell more Guitar Hero Aerosmiths, is by saying, okay, well, all those download songs that you had will be compatible with this game, or you can download more, you know, and have them compatible with both games.

377
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:08,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be smart, which is why they're not going to do it.

378
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Maniac 64 says, this is what we need, Guitar Hero F-Zero.

379
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how that would work, but it sounds good in theory.

380
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:25,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be just like, you know, the rock band commercial where they're on top of the bus, you know, playing their music, but on top of an F-Zero.

381
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,677
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the intro to the game, isn't it?

382
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:27,777
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero car.

383
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:28,358
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

384
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:29,619
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the intro to the game.

385
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:33,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, but still, that would be Guitar Hero F-Zero.

386
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:37,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, playing music really fast on a really, really, really fast car flying through the air.

387
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:47,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe instead of like that normal note track you have, you're actually on a car that's racing down one of those super fast F-Zero tracks doing loops and stuff, and you have to read the notes off that.

388
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

389
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:19,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be great!

390
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:23,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you get more points if you scream out, listen to my song, dammit.

391
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:24,989
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

392
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for those of us who are familiar with Micross 7.

393
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: All the mechs were based around music.

394
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:35,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, one of the biggest points in Macross was that music had a lot of power.

395
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was how, in the very first series, spoiler!

396
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:45,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, 20 years later, how in the first series they defeated the enemies that came by was because of stupid butthead minmei.

397
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:50,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, Macross 7 is sort of a big playoff of the whole music is power thing, so...

398
00:30:51,943 --> 00:31:19,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta tell you though, going back to F-Zero for a minute I was tempted this week to actually put in F-Zero GX and play it a little bit Because it's still one of my favorite racers And I think I said this over on Bobby's show when we were doing the tees tonight There aren't a lot of racing games I really like outside of F-Zero Because F-Zero is fast and it's horrifically simple That's what I like in a racing game I don't like all the complications I like Burnout because Burnout's fast too and it has explosions There's not a lot of racing games I really, really love They made a Burnout arcade game, that'd be pretty awesome That'd be pretty awesome

399
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,375
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on with more news.

400
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:36,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, me being a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto was a little bit disappointed to hear that the Grand Theft Auto download content that's been promised for me has been delayed to fiscal quarter one 2009.

401
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:38,941
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that mean?

402
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:42,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that means that it's due between November 1st, 2008 and January 31st, 2009.

403
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,523
[SPEAKER_04]: which, when you look at it, it's not really that bad anyways.

404
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:53,805
[SPEAKER_04]: But, hey, still though, I wish it was out a little bit sooner because, you know, I'm being... Because sooner is better!

405
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:54,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly!

406
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:59,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And because, you know, now that I'm almost done with the game, you know, I need more achievements.

407
00:32:00,247 --> 00:32:01,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I need more stuff to do.

408
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:03,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they add tanks.

409
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:04,828
[SPEAKER_04]: What about multiplayer?

410
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't multiplayer thrilling enough for you?

411
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:07,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiplayer is fun.

412
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:07,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

413
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,196
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

414
00:32:38,976 --> 00:32:39,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

415
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really in-depth message.

416
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:45,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hey, you know, I was surprised to see that pop up too.

417
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:47,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's just how they roll.

418
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:49,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

419
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:53,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alright though because if the download content comes out later...

420
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:54,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

421
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:15,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't watch the new trailer.

422
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,960
[SPEAKER_03]: What's so great about it?

423
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,262
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole trailer was comparing Grand Theft Auto 4 with Saints Row 2.

424
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:25,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a trailer highlighting the side missions you can do in the game.

425
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:32,808
[SPEAKER_04]: The side stuff you can do in Grand Theft Auto 4, they have bowling and playing pool and darts and stuff like that.

426
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:33,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

427
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:55,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Me being a fan of both games, both are great in their own aspects.

428
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just different.

429
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:59,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Star Wars and Spaceballs.

430
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:01,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So competition is healthy.

431
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

432
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:08,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to see, because a lot of the stuff that came from Saints Row ended up making it into Grand Theft Auto 4.

433
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:08,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole...

434
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:18,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Their navigation systems, pretty much the same as Saints Row, using the cell phone for all the cheats and stuff like that.

435
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:20,813
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot from Saints Row.

436
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:27,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the multiplayer, probably pushed them a little bit more to do multiplayer on the platform, which is good.

437
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:29,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, competition's good.

438
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to see that.

439
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:36,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, because Grand Theft Auto came out, they pushed Saints Row to add flying vehicles and stuff like that.

440
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't care.

441
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,319
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both awesome.

442
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,160
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to pick one.

443
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Play them both.

444
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:46,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, if you want to check out the Saints Row 2 trailer, it just got posted in our chat room there by Tigerclaw.

445
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:50,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's available on GameTrailers.com as a lot of game trailers are.

446
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just a clever site name.

447
00:34:53,786 --> 00:35:02,049
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Saints Row 2 though, if there is competition, Saints Row is really going to have to kind of sell a lot because the bar has been set pretty high.

448
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:11,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto 4 has sold 8.5 million units directly to consumers, 11 million copies sold to retailers.

449
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:16,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, that means about 2.5 million are sitting on store shelves right now, waiting to be scooped up through the holiday season.

450
00:35:17,394 --> 00:35:21,716
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all reported in Take-Two's second quarter financials reported earlier this week, so...

451
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:25,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too shabby 11 million units sold to retailers.

452
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Take two very happy campers right now.

453
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely happy campers.

454
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:34,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could sell 11 million units of one of my dream games.

455
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:35,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be rich.

456
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:36,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never have to work again.

457
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we all know, I'm telling you, if LaserCats the game came out, that's like 25 million.

458
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,735
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 billion units.

459
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:46,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

460
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:50,759
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not that many people in the world that everybody would buy like five copies because it would be that awesome.

461
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think?

462
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I smell another E.T.

463
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:57,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

464
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:01,588
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, speaking of E.T., this is going to sound so random, but I don't care.

465
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:02,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a mood tonight.

466
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:08,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on Wikipedia this week reading about old-school Atari games like E.T.

467
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,950
[SPEAKER_03]: and Pac-Man and, like, why they failed.

468
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fascinating.

469
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:11,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

470
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of reading up on my video game history.

471
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:16,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good to brush up on your video game history once in a while.

472
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:18,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you played E.T.

473
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're like, how is this anything like the movie?

474
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get this.

475
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get it when I was five.

476
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it now.

477
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:27,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

478
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:28,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I do my story?

479
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

480
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:30,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay then, thank you.

481
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:43,721
[SPEAKER_07]: More Xbox Live Arcade news is Commando 3, that's Wolf of the Battlefield, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade as of, I believe, next Wednesday.

482
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:45,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And will be 800 points.

483
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,465
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also has an invite to Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix Beta.

484
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:57,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder how many percentage of the purchasers of Commando 3 are actually trying to get the beta.

485
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:01,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what happened with Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta.

486
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:02,248
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea.

487
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But Crackdown was a pretty good game, so hopefully Commando 3 is a pretty good game as well.

488
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,001
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make it very worth it.

489
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,344
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not a big fan of all these 800 price points lately.

490
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the $5 games?

491
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,366
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time we got a $5 game?

492
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:17,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, we had like Warlords and stuff.

493
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that wasn't really worth it, though.

494
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now the Penny Arcade came out for 1,600 points.

495
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's like, hey, that game sells really well.

496
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:25,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $20.

497
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:27,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make our shitty games $20, too.

498
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody think there was a reason?

499
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:31,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

500
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't put two and two together.

501
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:34,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

502
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to download that, there are some other things you can download, especially if you own Guitar Hero 3.

503
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:45,145
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have some new Motorhead tracks coming out.

504
00:37:46,352 --> 00:37:48,134
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

505
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:16,677
[SPEAKER_04]: The pack that's coming out next week, which is the Isle of Wight, that is coming out June 12th.

506
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:21,640
[SPEAKER_04]: The price has been unconfirmed, but it's probably going to be also 500 Microsoft points.

507
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:30,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Includes Shoot the Runner by Cosbian, I Predict a Riot by Kaiser Chiefs, and Problems by the Sex Pistols.

508
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty awesome.

509
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:35,454
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

510
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:42,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, speaking of ever-expanding games, Soul Calibur IV, the roster of players just keeps growing and growing.

511
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:50,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly enough, when we got Darth Vader and Yoda announced for Soul Calibur IV, people were kind of like, oh, ha-ha, that's cute.

512
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:52,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have these Star Wars characters in the game.

513
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of random.

514
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:55,049
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the weird thing.

515
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:56,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur

516
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say it again after I've played the game.

517
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:16,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

518
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:17,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the deal.

519
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:23,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice is going to be in both versions of Soul Calibur 4.

520
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:27,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Darth Vader's only going to be in the PS3 one, Yoda in the Xbox 360 one.

521
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:32,796
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the Secret Apprentice... Now, the Secret Apprentice comes from Star Wars The Force Unleashed.

522
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,357
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's actually going to be in Soul Calibur 4.

523
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:37,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

524
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:41,198
[SPEAKER_03]: When that game comes out a little later this year...

525
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,027
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they need to put Bob Barker into a fighting game.

526
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:45,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, huh?

527
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:48,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bob Barker needs to be in a fighting game.

528
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would be pretty badass.

529
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:50,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Immortalize him.

530
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:52,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Put him in another Soul Calibur game.

531
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:54,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Calibur versus Happy Gilmore?

532
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:55,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

533
00:39:56,016 --> 00:39:57,858
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just like TV show hosts.

534
00:39:58,098 --> 00:39:58,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throw him in.

535
00:39:58,778 --> 00:39:59,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Random.

536
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,079
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to make any sense.

537
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The Star Wars stuff doesn't make any sense.

538
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:03,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throw it in.

539
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:07,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's TV show hosts, can he beat up Rosie O'Donnell and Barbara Walters?

540
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:08,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

541
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:09,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything can happen.

542
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:15,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob Barker, don't you know that he's held together by Clay and that formula from Death Becomes Her?

543
00:40:16,168 --> 00:40:17,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Celebrity Deathmatch.

544
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:18,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That already was a game, wasn't it?

545
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of characters held together by Clay.

546
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:22,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, really.

547
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they just need Celebrity Deathmatch 2.

548
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:45,778
[SPEAKER_07]: that would be great but you know what they should have if they did something like that is have download characters and have it you know where you could customize you know they have like you know like they do in the wrestling game so you can make different you know people you know mimic them in wrestling games you should have something like that in Celebrity Deathmatch could be make your own celebrity

549
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:46,918
[SPEAKER_04]: See what they need to do?

550
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:48,259
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to have more games.

551
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a celebrity, damn it.

552
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:50,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to put myself in the game.

553
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an internet celebrity.

554
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a pen that says so.

555
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,763
[SPEAKER_04]: What they need to do is have more games that have that kind of same humor as Kung Fu Hustle, kind of like God Hand, where it's just ridiculous and more of an anime style.

556
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:09,386
[SPEAKER_04]: That was more of a brawling game, but more of a fighting game with some funny characters that are just really exaggerated and stuff like that.

557
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:14,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur gets a lot of reaction from chat.

558
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check this out.

559
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says, Star Wars, GTFO of my Soul Calibur.

560
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:19,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get your own fighting game.

561
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:23,596
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they already did that and that didn't turn out too well either.

562
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:25,057
[SPEAKER_04]: The Terra...

563
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:26,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Then let Namco do it.

564
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:32,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually though, they're going to be doing something with the Force Unleashed on the Wii.

565
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:34,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have a fighting game portion of it.

566
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:38,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just put a Star Wars game that's based off the Soul Calibur engine?

567
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says this is Soul Calibur, not fucking Star Wars Calibur.

568
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheeseburger says Chuck Norris in Soul Calibur will roundhouse kick everyone.

569
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:47,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I dig that.

570
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:49,635
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't have a sword, he just has his roundhouse kicks.

571
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:50,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

572
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says luckily if anyone picks a Star Wars character, I'll pick Ivy and suffocate them to death.

573
00:41:56,954 --> 00:41:58,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like boob smash.

574
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

575
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.orange.com Is it my turn now?

576
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

577
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

578
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

579
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:04,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

580
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:05,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

581
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:12,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure people who've listened to this show for quite a while now know that I have an interest in law.

582
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I love... What?

583
00:42:16,173 --> 00:42:17,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are the law.

584
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:18,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

585
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:20,893
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

586
00:42:21,694 --> 00:42:25,138
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's an unhealthy obsession that you have there with Tekken.

587
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just waiting for her to go I am the law.

588
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a Judge Dredd pinball machine in my house.

589
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:33,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

590
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:42,648
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the former Supreme Court judges, Sandra Day O'Connor, is wanting to make a game that teaches court lessons.

591
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Our Courts.

592
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,249
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a free game for kids between 12 and 15.

593
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:57,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically lets you learn how courtrooms work, what the system is like, and learn actual legal issues.

594
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:12,015
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was in school, we used to do court simulations using the modern-day courtroom system to judge historical acts.

595
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to be Marie Antoinette, so I had to be really... Awesome!

596
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:15,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

597
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:17,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they behead you?

598
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:26,679
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost, don't get me started on the French Revolution because... Alright, because no one wants to hear about that.

599
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:31,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, I'm a history buff.

600
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:32,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my history.

601
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, here, I'll retard the conversation a little bit.

602
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:38,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we did in our school to practice courtroom?

603
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:39,044
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

604
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: We watched Nickelodeon Kids Court hosted by Paul Provanza.

605
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:43,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we did.

606
00:43:46,685 --> 00:43:52,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the other thing that we also did at my school was model United Nations and I got to be on the Security Council my senior year and that was freaking badass.

607
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:55,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I had to tell both China and the U.S.

608
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:55,707
[SPEAKER_07]: to shut up.

609
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: What country did you represent?

610
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:57,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Hungary.

611
00:44:02,084 --> 00:44:02,524
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

612
00:44:02,544 --> 00:44:04,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Hungary was on the Security Council that year.

613
00:44:05,005 --> 00:44:13,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering that your life has evolved into a food podcast that sometimes talks about video games, that's really funny that you represented Hungary.

614
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:15,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

615
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:16,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

616
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:18,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Home of the Habsburgs, right?

617
00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:19,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

618
00:44:20,315 --> 00:44:21,896
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't write this shit, you guys.

619
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:23,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all true.

620
00:44:23,357 --> 00:44:23,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

621
00:44:24,097 --> 00:44:24,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway...

622
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:43,781
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically just an educational game supposed to be put out so that children have a better understanding of how the government works without having to see the sort of farcical side of law enforcement with Grand Theft Auto and those types of things.

623
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, to actually see where...

624
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,460
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

625
00:45:05,643 --> 00:45:06,144
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

626
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:20,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give it a try.

627
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:26,231
[SPEAKER_07]: She's actually quoted saying it will allow students to engage in real legal issues.

628
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:32,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives an example of a debate by someone wearing a controversial t-shirt.

629
00:45:32,534 --> 00:45:41,978
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that freedom of speech versus how stupidly offended everybody in this country gets over people sneezing the wrong way.

630
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:44,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

631
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert M. makes the mandatory Phoenix Wright reference by saying, hold it

632
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, hold it.

633
00:45:53,307 --> 00:45:57,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.

634
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:04,556
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a couple stories that have come out recently about different gaming surveys and, oh my god, what it means and stuff like that.

635
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:06,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have never seen anything about this.

636
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:09,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And this just totally slipped under the radar for everybody, I think.

637
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:12,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

638
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:32,515
[SPEAKER_04]: What they describe, basically, here's their description of it.

639
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:39,060
[SPEAKER_04]: This game will be a game creator and will provide a simple way to make your own games on the Xbox.

640
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:46,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Using just the Xbox controller, you can build worlds, populate them with characters, and give the characters unique behaviors.

641
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:52,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You can easily build racing games, platformers, and adventure games without touching a keyboard or leaving your couch.

642
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:57,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is either XNA for dummies or LittleBigPlanet thing?

643
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:22,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Boku is a programming environment for children that runs on Windows and the Xbox 360.

644
00:47:23,814 --> 00:47:29,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically what makes it kind of different is it uses symbols.

645
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:36,243
[SPEAKER_04]: You have different objects for each symbol and you have actions and then other objects.

646
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:38,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of tie them all together without any programming language.

647
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:42,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So say you have a creature that looks like Pac-Man or something like that.

648
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:42,848
[SPEAKER_04]: You could say...

649
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:46,334
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pac-Man character eats dots.

650
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:51,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that character will now seek out the dots and try to eat them or something like that.

651
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically simple like that.

652
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:53,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's what I see.

653
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:56,314
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

654
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:17,742
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:36,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that is.

656
00:48:36,133 --> 00:48:37,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you link that picture to our chat?

657
00:48:37,974 --> 00:48:38,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

658
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:40,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a pregnant Batman ghost.

659
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:43,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just think it's really interesting.

660
00:48:44,095 --> 00:48:45,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Dark Tattoo says it sounds neat.

661
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:49,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish there was a PC version, but this is something being developed across both platforms, right?

662
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:51,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to be Windows and for the 360.

663
00:48:53,217 --> 00:49:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea, though, when it's going to be released or anything in that sense, but it looks like they're still working on it if they're sending out surveys about this thing.

664
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:03,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Why has this only been a blip on the gaming radar?

665
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:25,316
[SPEAKER_04]: This came out in 2007, the TechFest 2007.

666
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:30,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So like March of last year is when this originally was shown.

667
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:32,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And they only had it demoing.

668
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was covered by Wired.

669
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:38,243
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually had a little piece on it.

670
00:49:38,283 --> 00:49:39,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's about it.

671
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:41,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

672
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very interesting.

673
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:46,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

674
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be something that's coming soon.

675
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:48,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Something maybe they'll show at E3.

676
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:51,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

677
00:50:06,824 --> 00:50:08,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Game making software is actually pretty cool.

678
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Vaguely, I actually do remember that.

679
00:50:09,726 --> 00:50:09,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Very vaguely.

680
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty cool, but make something like that.

681
00:50:11,988 --> 00:50:22,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like LittleBigPlanet almost, but you can make your own games using this software and then distribute them to your friends or post them on some sort of integrated message board or something like that.

682
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:26,759
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to do the same thing with Blastworks, which is coming out this week.

683
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is going to be pretty awesome.

684
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to catch a lot of people by surprise.

685
00:50:30,602 --> 00:50:30,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

686
00:50:32,484 --> 00:50:35,218
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the way things are going.

687
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll link that picture in chat.

688
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:43,601
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, while you're waiting for more information on Boku, you can get some games a little bit sooner across the world.

689
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,022
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to cover release dates.

690
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start off in Japan tonight.

691
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:49,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot, sadly, coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

692
00:50:50,104 --> 00:50:54,906
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we look at the PlayStation 3, hello, Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.

693
00:50:55,006 --> 00:50:56,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this week in Japan.

694
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,867
[SPEAKER_03]: June the 12th is when you can get that.

695
00:50:58,307 --> 00:51:01,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the Japanese language version you can get over there.

696
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:03,449
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a premium pack, a special edition.

697
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:05,911
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

698
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:25,909
[SPEAKER_03]: A game called Breath.

699
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Toki wa Akanero is coming out on June the 12th, as well as another Pachinko game that has to do with Neon Genesis Evangelion is coming out, just because we didn't have enough Evangelion games on the DS.

700
00:51:40,115 --> 00:51:44,598
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm looking at what this Breath game is all about, and trying to figure out what this is.

701
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:45,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like an adventure game.

702
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:51,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to figure out if it's another dating sim, because it definitely looks like you have cute girls on the top screen and text on the bottom screen.

703
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,302
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually a good sign of a dating sim.

704
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that game.

705
00:51:56,961 --> 00:52:05,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And also coming out in Japan, Othello de Othello DS, which I'm assuming is just the classic game you might know as Reversi.

706
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is Othello, the old school game.

707
00:52:08,604 --> 00:52:21,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Sekai wa Atashi de Mawateru is coming out, which is a RPG game from Global A Entertainment.

708
00:52:22,448 --> 00:52:28,851
[SPEAKER_03]: and quickly glancing to see if there's anything on the PSP of note or if Metal Gear is just dominating the Sony universe this week.

709
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:35,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Medical 91 for Portable is listed for the Sony PSP.

710
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:36,734
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a game.

711
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:41,918
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Trauma Center, I'll tell you that.

712
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:43,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an adventure game.

713
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:48,470
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no screenshots, I couldn't tell you more about that, but looks like there's one lone game on the PSP this week.

714
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,277
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, not a lot wanting to compete with Metal Gear Solid 4 this week over in Japan.

715
00:52:53,424 --> 00:52:57,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do have our UK releases, if anyone is interested.

733
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,150
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks awesome.

734
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I plan on picking it up when it comes out.

735
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:40,884

00:54:45,726 --> 00:54:47,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not exactly Tumiki Fighters.

739
00:54:47,926 --> 00:54:55,589
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have Tumiki Fighters in there as an unlockable game, but it is completely rebuilt, and it's a lot more than just Tumiki Fighters.

740
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:56,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a ripoff.

741
00:54:56,909 --> 00:55:00,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a lot of stuff to offer, so definitely check it out.

742
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:01,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the company pay you to plug them?

743
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:11,758
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the company did not pay me to plug it and I'm just, I think it looks really good and they're going to have this whole Blastworks Depot thing where you can upload and download objects created by other people.

744
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:16,081
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, for example, you could take this and make like your own Star Fox game.

745
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:19,783
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take this and make another Guardian Legends game if you wanted to.

746
00:55:20,424 --> 00:55:21,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, stuff like that.

747
00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:23,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I think it has a lot of

748
00:55:27,987 --> 00:55:34,230
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

749
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:41,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, if you want to get something a little sooner as in right now, the PlayStation Network updated on Thursday, and they added quite a bit of new things.

[SPEAKER_03]: A retro theme has come out for the PlayStation 3.

762
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:25,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what type of retro that is.

763
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,281
[SPEAKER_03]: How retro could that be?

764
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:29,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe PS1 graphics?

765
00:56:29,744 --> 00:56:30,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Betamax.

766
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:33,988
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be kind of rad.

767
00:56:35,764 --> 00:56:37,527
[SPEAKER_03]: comes up with like the beta logo and stuff.

768
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:44,034

[SPEAKER_03]: Some TV spots, wallpaper, and the whole freaking game itself if you want that.

771
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:51,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

772
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:53,546
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Network updates this week.

773
00:56:54,588 --> 00:56:58,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, another thing that's been updated is Sega's calendar.

774
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:12,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like that Sonic Unleashed is going to be out in November, but other things people might have been waiting on, like Aliens, Colonial Marines, and Empire Total War are both going to be out in 2009.

775
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:23,894
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Beijing Olympics game is going to be out on the 27th of June, and on August 27th is a game called Space Siege, which is by Gas Power Games.

776
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:51,554
[SPEAKER_07]: so other things that are set to be out is a Golden Axe I guess a revamp of it Sonic Chronicles Bioware role playing game and Picto Image DS also a sequel to Yakuza I hate to say this because I know Sega is near and dear to your heart and I don't know how you feel about this series but Golden Axe was something that was way cooler when I was a kid

777
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Golden Axe.

778
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:55,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Golden Axe the Duel a whole lot too.

779
00:57:55,324 --> 00:58:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went and I downloaded the Genesis version on Virtual Console and I was just kind of like, oh my god, this game is repetitive and boring.

780
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:04,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so much better when I was a kid.

781
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

782
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:09,133
[SPEAKER_03]: But somehow the charm, the magic was lost.

783
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:12,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was because I wasn't playing with friends at a pizza joint.

784
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,036
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

785
00:58:13,096 --> 00:58:14,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Games like that are always much funner with friends.

786
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Because couldn't you hit each other in that game?

787
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're on that little...

788
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:18,979
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

789
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:46,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoilers, sorry.

790
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:51,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say one of the games she forgot mentioning there.

791
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:55,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we're going to like this game on the Wii.

792
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:57,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Samba de Amigo.

793
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,015
[SPEAKER_04]: That's out this summer.

794
00:58:59,856 --> 00:59:00,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

795
00:59:01,677 --> 00:59:03,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But only if there's like fake maracas.

796
00:59:04,284 --> 00:59:05,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I love maracas.

797
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:09,067
[SPEAKER_07]: You know someone's going to release a maracas attachment.

798
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:09,727
[SPEAKER_03]: They will.

799
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:13,689
[SPEAKER_03]: They've talked about the little plastic sleeves and silly things like that.

800
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, if they don't, what a difference duct tape and maracas can make.

801
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:22,373
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need to do is order more free condoms for your controller.

802
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:25,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, we should do, okay, you know what we should do?

803
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:28,316
[SPEAKER_07]: The Orange Zones Radio Edition maracas.

804
00:59:28,657 --> 00:59:29,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

805
00:59:29,758 --> 00:59:33,939
[SPEAKER_07]: and we make them out of paper mache like you used to do in kindergarten.

806
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:35,539
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get all the supplies at Michael's.

807
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:36,399
[SPEAKER_07]: We will.

808
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,520
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually just buy gourds and duct tape a gourd to it.

809
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,680
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be fantastic.

810
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,121
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't live, Michael's is all across the US, right?

811
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

812
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a craft store.

813
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:52,082
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live abroad, you haven't lived until you've visited a Michael's.

814
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just put it that way.

815
00:59:55,783 --> 00:59:57,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great little craft store.

816
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:57,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, forget it.

817
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:06,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, okay, I've been spending so much time with stuff I have to get at Michael's that, okay, I'm gonna make maracas.

818
01:00:07,546 --> 01:00:08,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Just you watch.

819
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

820
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:08,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make them.

821
01:00:09,187 --> 01:00:10,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on YouTube and all that stuff.

822
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:12,090
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a YouTube channel we don't use for anything.

823
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,010
[SPEAKER_06]: But I won't be on YouTube.

824
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Your hands can be, right?

825
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:15,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

826
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:18,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually thought about buying a tub of the fondant there one time.

827
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:21,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that stuff tastes like those animal cookies.

828
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:23,298
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really not good for you.

829
01:00:23,738 --> 01:00:24,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, forget it.

830
01:00:24,258 --> 01:00:24,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Move on, move on.

831
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:27,816
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that has nothing to do with Michaels.

832
01:00:30,257 --> 01:00:37,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it's sad to see that Itagaki has left Tecmo.

833
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:42,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not going to see him helming any more Ninja Gaiden or Dead or Alive games.

834
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:44,788
[SPEAKER_04]: At least not with Team Ninja.

835
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:50,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why he left, but I guess just...

836
01:00:53,204 --> 01:00:59,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Emotional distress, worsening personal relationships and work environment.

837
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember right, wasn't there something about unpaid overtime too?

838
01:01:03,678 --> 01:01:04,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something that factored into it?

839
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:08,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there are... Basically, he's a very disgruntled employee right now.

840
01:01:08,538 --> 01:01:09,078
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a rock star.

841
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,860
[SPEAKER_04]: He can't be, like, you know, tied down with a job and stuff.

842
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,221
[SPEAKER_04]: He has to be trashing hotel rooms.

843
01:01:13,241 --> 01:01:14,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Itagaki is a fucking rock star.

844
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:19,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you don't see a lot of, like, gaming rock stars.

845
01:01:19,145 --> 01:01:19,786
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they need.

846
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:21,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Itagaki is a rock star.

847
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:27,171
[SPEAKER_04]: They need him to hang out with, like, say, the guy that, you know, does the Castlevania games, Akira Yamaoka.

848
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:33,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, like, make this, like, really kick-ass, like, you know, Guitar Wolf programming team that just, like, fucking says...

849
01:01:33,975 --> 01:01:39,720
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they come in, they kick over the microphone, they're like, fuck this, you're buying our fucking game, and everyone's like, hell yeah I am!

850
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how they need to do it.

851
01:01:42,022 --> 01:01:45,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that would just, like, scare the crap out of the press.

852
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:46,625
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

853
01:01:46,885 --> 01:01:53,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Just come in, set something on fire, throw it into the crowd, just like, you know, that's how you sell your game.

854
01:01:55,493 --> 01:02:00,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Women coming out and wearing nothing but, you know, skimpy ass clothing.

855
01:02:00,497 --> 01:02:02,258
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't fucking care if it's offensive.

856
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:03,639
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, whatever, man.

857
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some fabric they bought at Michael's.

858
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:06,961
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

859
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:11,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Whipped cream, that's it.

860
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:12,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Just whipped cream.

861
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Barbecue condiments, I don't know.

862
01:02:16,694 --> 01:02:17,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Itagaki is a rock star.

863
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:19,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So he'll go on to doing something, right?

864
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure, yeah.

865
01:02:21,957 --> 01:02:28,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hopefully he doesn't decide to go develop playground equipment like a certain other people.

866
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:31,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless the playground equipment electrocutes children.

867
01:02:32,884 --> 01:02:33,665
[SPEAKER_04]: That I could see.

868
01:02:33,725 --> 01:02:35,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And has fake boobs that are on it.

869
01:02:36,446 --> 01:02:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

870
01:02:40,734 --> 01:02:44,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what he does in the middle of the presentation, just a motorboat right there.

871
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:47,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Busts out with that.

872
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:49,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Empire game.

873
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:56,018
[SPEAKER_03]: How come you never see someone like him busted for destroying hotel rooms?

874
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

875
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:57,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

876
01:02:57,799 --> 01:02:59,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just wait for this year's E3.

877
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:01,580
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that could be the Rock Band sequel.

878
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:12,663
[SPEAKER_07]: No, keep in mind, instead of, you have Rock Band the RPG, where, you know, you go and you trash hotel rooms and have groupies and, you know, that type of thing.

879
01:03:12,763 --> 01:03:13,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

880
01:03:13,604 --> 01:03:15,705
[SPEAKER_03]: How about video game Rock Band or something?

881
01:03:15,745 --> 01:03:17,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you could play as Itagaki.

882
01:03:17,046 --> 01:03:17,687
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, maybe not.

883
01:03:18,347 --> 01:03:18,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not.

884
01:03:19,268 --> 01:03:21,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Itagaki's got his own thing going on.

885
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,011
[SPEAKER_07]: He's, you know, cool.

886
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to have champagne and only green M&Ms.

887
01:03:27,414 --> 01:03:27,594
Yeah.

888
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:32,664
[SPEAKER_03]: What would it be?

889
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:32,824
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

890
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:53,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa!

891
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,250
[SPEAKER_03]: On to things less cool.

892
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:22,702
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be a photojournalist, and you can take pictures on foot, in a car, or by air balloon, which is kind of rad, because you don't see hot air balloons make many gaming appearances.

893
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:31,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can unlock non-CG pictures and actual research footage of animals as you encounter animals in game.

894
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And it comes out on August 28th.

895
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,909
[SPEAKER_03]: You build up this animal library.

896
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:37,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, great.

897
01:04:37,129 --> 01:04:40,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know as much as possible about the things I'm running over in my Jeep.

898
01:04:42,552 --> 01:04:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can do that in the game.

899
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:45,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

900
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:49,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's Africa Snap, but it doesn't sound like it's on a track.

901
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:51,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds kind of a whole lot cooler.

902
01:04:51,616 --> 01:04:52,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say this.

903
01:04:52,357 --> 01:05:05,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching a trailer for the game, and with the graphics and all, I got to say, it does look like potentially it's going to be a very kick-ass, like I don't even know if you really call it a game, like a kick-ass thing.

904
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:09,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks really neat, I gotta say.

905
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, maybe we'll all end up eating crow about making fun of this game at E3 a few years ago.

906
01:05:15,384 --> 01:05:16,685
[SPEAKER_03]: But it actually looks kind of neat.

907
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:18,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to check this out.

908
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:21,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and then Aya Judgment's gonna be awesome too.

909
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:21,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

910
01:05:22,049 --> 01:05:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, you really gotta check out the preview.

911
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:25,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the graphics look gorgeous.

912
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:26,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely gorgeous.

913
01:05:26,692 --> 01:05:27,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they do look gorgeous.

914
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:29,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

915
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:30,534
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it say about the gameplay?

916
01:05:30,795 --> 01:05:31,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

917
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:31,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

918
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:34,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And the gameplay could suck, and this game could still suck.

919
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:36,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just saying, there's hope.

920
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:39,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, we had no hope.

921
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:42,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa was just the running joke.

922
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,802
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that we're finding out a little bit about it, it sounds interesting.

923
01:05:44,842 --> 01:05:45,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

924
01:05:45,222 --> 01:05:48,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Frisbee says in the chatroom, Africa equals Endless Ocean.

925
01:05:48,965 --> 01:05:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, pretty much.

926
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did Endless Ocean do?

927
01:05:51,707 --> 01:05:52,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very well.

928
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,652
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another Safari game that was on the Wii.

929
01:05:56,992 --> 01:05:57,672
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucked.

930
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:06,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say the only Safari game that did any... This is not even really a Safari game, but a similar game that did really well was Pokemon Snap.

931
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess that's because it had Pokemon in it.

932
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:12,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we ever had a really kick-ass Safari game?

933
01:06:12,423 --> 01:06:13,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jumbo Safari, of course.

934
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:15,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just an arcade game.

935
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:18,769
[SPEAKER_04]: People like that game because the seat moves and you're going really fast.

936
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:19,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're catching animals.

937
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can throw harpoons.

938
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:24,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Harpoons make every game better!

939
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:28,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Add that to the list of things that make games better.

940
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:29,266
[SPEAKER_07]: One, Dragon Force.

941
01:06:29,326 --> 01:06:30,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, Harpoons.

942
01:06:31,126 --> 01:06:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

943
01:06:31,586 --> 01:06:32,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Three, Pokemon.

944
01:06:32,466 --> 01:06:34,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Who didn't love Scorpion in the first Mortal Kombat?

945
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:35,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon does not make things better.

946
01:06:36,587 --> 01:06:36,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop that.

947
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:37,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

948
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:39,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That is wrong.

949
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:40,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes, it has been stricken.

950
01:06:40,888 --> 01:06:42,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon has flavor.

951
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:45,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

952
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:46,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Eating Pokemon would make a game better.

953
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:47,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

954
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:49,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one thing that makes games better.

955
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:51,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Force.

956
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:53,471
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, they have a new album coming out.

957
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:53,711
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

958
01:06:53,991 --> 01:06:54,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Do what?

959
01:06:54,812 --> 01:06:55,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two.

960
01:06:55,893 --> 01:06:56,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Things that make games better.

961
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:57,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Harpoons.

962
01:06:58,636 --> 01:06:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Three.

963
01:06:59,456 --> 01:07:01,618
[SPEAKER_07]: The other things that make games better.

964
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:02,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.

965
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:03,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Shooting hookers.

966
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:06,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get them on the show promoting their album.

967
01:07:06,864 --> 01:07:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send them an email right after the show.

968
01:07:08,765 --> 01:07:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

969
01:07:09,566 --> 01:07:09,826
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

970
01:07:10,942 --> 01:07:13,384
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we have some other business to take care of real quick.

971
01:07:14,525 --> 01:07:14,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.

972
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:20,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says in chat, the real question is, will Africa show animals doing it?

973
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:21,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

974
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:21,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

975
01:07:22,012 --> 01:07:27,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it's supposed to stimulate the wildlife.

976
01:07:27,337 --> 01:07:28,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we know where my brain is.

977
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:33,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it's supposed to simulate wildlife, what do wildlife often do?

978
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:37,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things.

979
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:38,790
[SPEAKER_07]: One, animals fuck.

980
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:44,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, monkeys throw poo.

981
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:46,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

982
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:54,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that there's a little robotic camera that you can drive around and take pictures with in Africa?

983
01:07:56,021 --> 01:07:58,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was like that little, like it looked like a Mars lander or something.

984
01:07:58,923 --> 01:07:59,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked kind of rad.

985
01:07:59,584 --> 01:08:00,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to annoy things with that.

986
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:01,806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

987
01:08:02,506 --> 01:08:03,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tetsuya's got it.

988
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:04,307
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

989
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:09,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of doing Africa, they should do Jurassic Park with a cam.

990
01:08:10,512 --> 01:08:14,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could like drop lawyers in there and, you know, watch them eat people.

991
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:18,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you trying to avoid getting eaten by a velociraptor?

992
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:19,799
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you have a robot camera.

993
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.

994
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:26,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking a trip down memory lane for a minute, and we're about to get into the Classic Game of the Week, so this is okay.

995
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:31,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember this game, the original Jurassic Park game that was on Super Nintendo.

996
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It boasted like it was one of the first games that used surround sound and all this stuff.

997
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's the thing, is that the game was kind of split into two parts.

998
01:08:39,233 --> 01:08:48,216
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an overworld thing that was kind of generic, like it was your basic 3D ISO type view where you go around the world collecting things, whatever.

999
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:49,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1000
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:10,146
[SPEAKER_07]: It was freaky.

1001
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:12,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Hitler comes out in a robotic machine.

1002
01:09:12,387 --> 01:09:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was at Chesterview Lanes one time, back when they had an arcade and not a pro shop.

1003
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:22,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had, for some reason, their Jurassic Park shooter game was broken.

1004
01:09:24,151 --> 01:09:25,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I got to play on free play the whole time.

1005
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've beaten the arcade one.

1006
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,032
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm very disappointed in?

1007
01:09:29,092 --> 01:09:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: This is totally off topic, but that's fine.

1008
01:09:31,513 --> 01:09:32,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Off topic, guys?

1009
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Who?

1010
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: This show?

1011
01:09:33,573 --> 01:09:34,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Off topic?

1012
01:09:34,494 --> 01:09:35,334
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to do with games.

1013
01:09:36,554 --> 01:09:36,814
[SPEAKER_04]: A couch.

1014
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We are getting a couch and I'm thinking we're going to put it right there where Loki usually sits.

1015
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1016
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:02,822
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way.

1017
01:10:02,902 --> 01:10:03,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie has the blue seat.

1018
01:10:04,102 --> 01:10:11,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to buy us an air conditioner with the funds that were donated to us.

1019
01:10:11,664 --> 01:10:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

1020
01:10:13,145 --> 01:10:18,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to put it in that window and we're not going to burn our asses off here in the studio.

1021
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:19,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that bad.

1022
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:21,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Not right now, but wait until August.

1023
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:22,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1024
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:24,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we could get more fans.

1025
01:10:24,108 --> 01:10:26,048
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get the damn air conditioner.

1026
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:27,129
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1027
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,429
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a game called Beat the Heat.

1028
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,818
[SPEAKER_07]: or you actually take like pockets of heat and beat them to death.

1029
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,060
[SPEAKER_03]: One other quick thing about Jurassic Park.

1030
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it weird that the Genesis version of Jurassic Park was like a completely fucking different game?

1031
01:10:39,487 --> 01:10:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, it was more of a side-scroller.

1032
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:41,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It was better.

1033
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, well, kind of.

1034
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:45,213
[SPEAKER_04]: He could play as the Velociraptor and kill people.

1035
01:10:45,313 --> 01:10:46,375
[SPEAKER_04]: True, alright, there you go.

1036
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:51,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about everything was different, you know, for games that would come out on one system versus the other.

1037
01:10:52,312 --> 01:10:52,592
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1038
01:10:53,613 --> 01:10:58,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, nostalgia is awesome and all, but we have another segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1039
01:10:58,735 --> 01:11:01,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a chance for us to... It's nostalgic, too.

1040
01:11:02,276 --> 01:11:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very nostalgic.

1041
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:08,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a chance for us to pay tribute, if you will, to the elders of gaming.

1042
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:09,139
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1043
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a list of two, and thanks to Sauce, I have a list of one.

1044
01:11:14,721 --> 01:11:16,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you'll just use the other one next week, won't you?

1045
01:11:17,419 --> 01:11:18,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably forget.

1046
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:18,880
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1047
01:11:19,361 --> 01:11:20,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had to go in the vault to pick this again, too.

1048
01:11:21,002 --> 01:11:21,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, look.

1049
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:27,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a classic video game of the week for you kids to dig up and play.

1050
01:11:28,147 --> 01:11:31,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura is dug through the archives with sauce.

1051
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:31,749
[SPEAKER_03]: The archives.

1052
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:32,349
[SPEAKER_03]: The archives.

1053
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,450
[SPEAKER_03]: What is wrong with me tonight?

1054
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:33,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm broken.

1055
01:11:33,951 --> 01:11:34,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Malfunction, malfunction.

1056
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:35,231
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1057
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Exterminate.

1058
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:40,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Exterminate.

1059
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,916
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the classic game the kids should be playing this week?

1060
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:43,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 5.

1061
01:11:43,517 --> 01:11:44,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 5.

1062
01:11:46,016 --> 01:11:47,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I came to the lobby.

1063
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:55,400
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the information, there are a lot of pilots and viewers.

1064
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:19,561
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll listen to some awesome boss music too while you talk about the game.

1065
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I want to actually, because it's my favorite music in the game.

1066
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:22,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then we won't.

1067
01:12:22,864 --> 01:12:23,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1068
01:12:23,264 --> 01:12:31,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Space Channel 5 is a game where it's sort of like a Simon Says kind of game where you play as a reporter named Ulala.

1069
01:12:32,892 --> 01:12:42,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one is obviously from the Japanese version, but her voice actor in America was Apollo Smile, who was supposed to be like the living anime girl who's actually kind of a big hoe.

1070
01:12:43,019 --> 01:12:43,380
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um...

1071
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:48,502
[SPEAKER_07]: With this one though, it is technically a music slash puzzle game.

1072
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:58,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole point of this is that you run into these little aliens called Melodians.

1073
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:01,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's funny when you have your load screen that says, Now Meloding, which I thought was pretty funny.

1074
01:13:02,589 --> 01:13:09,554
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, they'll name out a direction and then maybe a shoot button, and you have to mimic it when it's your turn.

1075
01:13:09,754 --> 01:13:13,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has to be perfectly in time with the same rhythm that they did.

1076
01:13:14,438 --> 01:13:16,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to have a really good sense

1077
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:17,300
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

1078
01:13:36,668 --> 01:13:40,591
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a Game Boy Advance one that I didn't play because I refused to.

1079
01:13:41,432 --> 01:13:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rez had Merolion in it as one of the evolutions for the characters.

1080
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was pretty cool.

1081
01:13:51,081 --> 01:13:54,043
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a Space Channel 5 minigame in Sega Superstars.

1082
01:13:54,103 --> 01:13:55,324
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a spawn at the...

1083
01:13:56,685 --> 01:13:57,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that.

1084
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:58,107
[SPEAKER_07]: She's in the add-ons, too.

1085
01:14:14,362 --> 01:14:18,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Ulala and Pudding are playable characters in Sega Super Star Tennis.

1086
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:19,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Pudding is like her rival.

1087
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:23,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Pudding is also one of the best video game characters ever.

1088
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:25,012
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also Space Channel 5 Part 2.

1089
01:14:25,813 --> 01:14:26,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like D-Lite?

1090
01:14:32,619 --> 01:14:33,279
[SPEAKER_07]: The group D.L.I.T.E.

1091
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the one song that everybody knows by D.L.I.T.E.

1092
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick, name two D.L.I.T.E.

1093
01:14:37,581 --> 01:14:38,121
[SPEAKER_07]: songs.

1094
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:41,302
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Grooves in the Heart that everyone knows.

1095
01:14:41,342 --> 01:14:45,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have one of their later albums that I thought was really good.

1096
01:14:45,883 --> 01:14:55,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But Lady Miss Keir, who is their singer, actually opened a lawsuit against Sega for basing Ulala off of her without her permission.

1097
01:14:56,954 --> 01:15:24,602
[SPEAKER_07]: and Hippolytus is in chat right now knows quite a bit about Delight apparently they split up years ago and Kier Kirby and DJ Dimitri married and Tawate was in that group too and he does remixes for like everybody but anyway the way that that went is that Sega offered her $16,000 for licensing and to use their songs and she refused and they went ahead and made the game anyway but she lost the lawsuit and had to pay Sega's legal fees so

1098
01:15:25,682 --> 01:15:25,942
[SPEAKER_07]: of $608,000.

1099
01:15:26,002 --> 01:15:34,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... And actually, that was Michael Jackson doing his own voice acting in the game, by the way.

1100
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:36,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Michael Jackson loves Sega.

1101
01:15:36,769 --> 01:15:38,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he only say, like, two things in the game, though?

1102
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,151
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, thank you, ooh-la-la.

1103
01:15:40,632 --> 01:15:44,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega made that freaking Moonwalker game, which was all kinds of badass.

1104
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, he had a whole big... In Space Shuttle 5 Part 2, there's a whole part of the game that's doing nothing but Michael Jackson dances.

1105
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:53,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at the rocket launch site.

1106
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,900
[SPEAKER_07]: What could it be?

1107
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I can sense something suspicious.

1108
01:16:22,112 --> 01:16:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this stage.

1109
01:16:24,115 --> 01:16:35,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Gerardmo Boots, he says, the first level is my favorite song they sing.

1110
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:51,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Up, Up, Kick, Up, Up, Kick, Right, Left, Kick, Right, Left, Kick, Down, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick,

1111
01:16:59,352 --> 01:16:59,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit!

1112
01:16:59,512 --> 01:16:59,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit!

1113
01:16:59,652 --> 01:16:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit!

1114
01:16:59,973 --> 01:17:00,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit!

1115
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,412
[SPEAKER_07]: When she saves people.

1116
01:17:23,952 --> 01:17:25,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I think is what they say.

1117
01:17:25,494 --> 01:17:30,500
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, Space Channel 5 too, though, had my favorite bad guy in any game ever, though.

1118
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the three robots that had the speakers coming out of their head that would sing like the barbershop quartet.

1119
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:36,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I remember that.

1120
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:38,088
[SPEAKER_07]: They were awesome.

1121
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,531
[SPEAKER_07]: We need more Space Channel 5.

1122
01:17:40,751 --> 01:17:41,492
[SPEAKER_07]: We need more Ulala.

1123
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:43,990
[SPEAKER_03]: will be awesome.

1124
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:44,710
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1125
01:17:45,451 --> 01:17:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Channel 5 is your classic game of the week available on the Dreamcast.

1126
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:52,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it was repackaged for PlayStation 2.

1127
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:53,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1128
01:17:53,974 --> 01:17:55,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out on either of those systems.

1129
01:17:55,994 --> 01:17:58,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say they're both good or you need to actually check it out?

1130
01:17:58,936 --> 01:17:59,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I figured.

1131
01:18:00,756 --> 01:18:01,917
[SPEAKER_03]: You always pick Dreamcast games.

1132
01:18:01,937 --> 01:18:03,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, actually, actually, Rob.

1133
01:18:03,379 --> 01:18:03,539
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1134
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:09,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say that I do have Space Channel 5 2 on PlayStation 2.

1135
01:18:10,004 --> 01:18:10,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really good.

1136
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have played Space Channel 5 on PlayStation 2.

1137
01:18:14,468 --> 01:18:16,750
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was also very good.

1138
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:17,931
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very good port.

1139
01:18:18,472 --> 01:18:19,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, very cool.

1140
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:20,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I have a request.

1141
01:18:20,814 --> 01:18:23,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week I'm going to challenge you to pick something not Sega.

1142
01:18:24,835 --> 01:18:32,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I haven't done Sega, I don't, what was, okay, last week was Sega, the week before that, oh, the week before that was Sega.

1143
01:18:32,771 --> 01:18:33,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1144
01:18:33,593 --> 01:18:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the week before that?

1145
01:18:35,612 --> 01:18:36,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check the wiki.

1146
01:18:36,532 --> 01:18:37,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

1147
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:38,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick whatever the hell you want.

1148
01:18:38,273 --> 01:18:39,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega is awesome.

1149
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:43,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there something creepy and not related to Sega in any way?

1150
01:18:43,754 --> 01:18:45,834
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making another Barbie Horse Adventures game.

1151
01:18:45,914 --> 01:18:46,455
[SPEAKER_07]: The fuck?

1152
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:47,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, chat room.

1153
01:18:47,695 --> 01:18:49,035
[SPEAKER_07]: People who update our wiki.

1154
01:18:49,795 --> 01:19:00,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I need someone who has elite skills in Excel or Access to put everything into a spreadsheet and see the percentage of games that I have picked that are Sega.

1155
01:19:02,546 --> 01:19:02,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1156
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:03,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1157
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:04,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in Excel.

1158
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:05,448
[SPEAKER_07]: It's freaking easy.

1159
01:19:06,168 --> 01:19:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ Mix says eight Sega games overall, I guess.

1160
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:10,331
