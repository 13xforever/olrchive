25
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The only thing about Defend Your Castle is it gets a little bit old

26
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Especially if you're playing by yourself

27
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But it's a neat party game

28
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who doesn't love flinging people to their deaths?

29
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm surprised DarkSakura isn't all over this game

30
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She could be flinging helpless bad guys to their deaths

31
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Defend Your Castle, it's a WiiWare game

32
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I haven't played much Wii lately

33
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll have to show it to you at some point, it's fun

34
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's based on an old, old Flash game

35
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think it's called the same thing

36
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Defend Your Castle, it's very similar

37
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But it was much bloodier in the Flash version

38
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They had to, you know, Wii-itize it or whatever you want to call it

39
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They had to tone it down, but I like the style

40
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And if you notice also, just like that Gummy Car game or whatever they had

41
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's all done with the guy's voice

42
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, I love it, his voice is great

43
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's like the music in the game, it's great

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Games I played this week, lots and lots of World of Warcraft

45
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because I'm kind of addicted

46
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I did check out a couple of the new arcade games on Xbox Live

47
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
These are demos only, so I'm really basing my opinion on demos

48
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Just kind of a disclaimer there

49
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Ace of the Galaxy, I don't know

50
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I played it for a little while, it was kind of interesting

51
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The shooting style of it reminded me a little bit of Rez

52
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Where you could lock on to things and let all your bullets go off at once

53
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But then I go, you know, I'm kind of playing it, and I'm just like, I just want to play Rez

54
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Play a game like this

55
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But it was okay, but I don't know

56
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't justify spending little nickels and dimes here and there

57
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Games got to really wow me

58
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Back in the old days of Xbox Live, I was buying everything and everything

59
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have so much crap on Xbox Live, I can't even stand it

60
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But now a game's got to really wow me, and it just didn't have that for me

61
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I also played Rugu, that new puzzle-y game

62
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But I didn't exactly see where the puzzle was in it

63
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Because it was more of a reaction game

64
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now granted, I only played the demo of this

65
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And the game made it sound like there was a lot more to be unveiled after the demo

66
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But if that's the case, then the game didn't really sell me

67
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because all I really saw in the demo was

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Turn these little disks as fast as you can

69
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
To make sure the shapes, as they fall, fall through the right shape

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You remember that old, old game like we had in elementary school called Perfection

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Where you had to put those little shapes in the right holes before pop

72
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They all pop out, like before the board explodes

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right, you ever played that game? Am I the one that played that?

74
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I used to play it

75
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think it was awesome, okay, thank god

76
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Alright, it's kind of like that

77
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You want to make sure you turn the disk

78
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So that a star shape throws to the star hole repeatedly

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or else the galaxy blows up

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Basically

81
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In a nutshell

82
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But I couldn't figure out, like, how is this game gonna

83
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, granted as it was going along, it added more shapes

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And it got a little harder

85
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you had to, like, squash these aliens by speeding the bricks up

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But it was still about reaction time

87
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was kind of like, where is the puzzle game in this?

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If there's a puzzle game here, the demo totally neglected to show it to me

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You have to understand, if there's objects falling down on a screen, it's a puzzle game

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I guess, but not to me

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So I wasn't very impressed

92
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Which is a darn shame

93
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because the graphics and previews for the future levels made it look like more exciting things were to come

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But I don't know

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe I'll have to look it up on the internet and see if there's videos of future levels that make the game more interesting

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Because, I mean, it did hold my attention

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was like, whee, rotating disks is fun, this game is easy, I bet it could get lots of achievement points

98
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But then, like, when the demo was over, I was like, that's it?

99
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's it?

100
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So

101
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Those are the two new games I played this week

102
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Otherwise I've been playing more audio surf as well, that game's pretty rad, I talked about that on last week's show

103
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you missed that

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Alright, we're going to get into some gaming news here shortly

105
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I also want to introduce the one and only chat room

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Gerardimo in chat says, Rugoo equals the baby toy for adults

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Kinda

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Gerardimo also says, Rugoo equals boring, a lot

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
AJ Mix has been playing a lot of Wii in his week

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He's been playing Dr. Mario on WiiWare, Battalion Wars Wii, Bomberman Live on Wii, and Mario Paint on the Super Nintendo

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's old school

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Anybody checked out Dr. Mario on WiiWare yet?

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's one of those games I keep like, I need to get it, but I have no space

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No, this is just like, remember how Nintendo said, oh we have a hundred WiiWare games in development

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, they're all gonna be fucking old clones of shit

117
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then they're gonna put Dr. Mario out there

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Just put Dr. Mario out there

119
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But, hold on, to be fair, Nintendo is the master

120
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No one does it better

121
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Case in point, Mario All-Stars on Super Nintendo

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Who didn't love that game?

124
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because it was like the upgraded versions of the old Mario games

125
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again

126
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And they do a good job of it

127
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Maybe that was a little fanboyish statement, but they do

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, I have to ask about this before we get into housekeeping tonight

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And tonight at housekeeping I'm gonna address why there's been changes on Justin.tv

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We'll get to that in a minute

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But, first I wanna ask Loki. Loki ran through the door

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like, during the Bobby Black Wolf call

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He calls in right before we go live

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because, you know, we tape live on AllGames.com every Sunday night

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And if you haven't joined us yet, you ought to

136
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And the show before us is the Bobby Black Wolf show

137
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And, you know, we've been buddy shows for years

138
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, you know, this is awesome that we follow his show

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But he always does this little tease when he calls our program right at the end of the show

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And Loki ran in right during that statement

141
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I got a call right before saying

142
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Rob, I'm gonna be late, there's food problems

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So I have to ask

144
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What the hell is the...

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How did food drama make you late tonight?

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because the pizza place I ordered these breadsticks from said

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It would take 10 minutes

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I went down there, 10 minutes

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And took another 20 minutes after I got there

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Apparently it was a stupid, stupid employee night

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know, where they're like

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, I forgot to put the breadsticks in

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay, so they put them in

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But they only put in half my order

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, I forgot to put the other half in

156
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, you know, I'm just sitting there

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Nice

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And the guy, you know, up front

159
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Working cash register

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Had his mouth open

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Kind of drooling there

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And some guy's like

163
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Is my pizza ready?

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I called it in, he said it's gonna be 20 minutes

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And it's been 25

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So, can you check on it?

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, she said that it's gonna be

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It was, you know, gonna be about 5 minutes once you've ordered it

169
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What do you mean?

170
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What?

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He's like

172
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, well, they just put it in

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Can you go check on that?

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's just like stupid and just standing there

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I love how food emergencies are a valid excuse

176
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio for making you personally late

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I had plenty of time, you know, if my food

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Even with like a slight delay

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I would have still been here on time

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But it was like fucking 40 minutes for breadsticks

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That shit takes like 2 minutes to make

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Alright

183
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's talk about Justin TV at Housekeeping tonight

184
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We've changed a little bit over on Justin TV

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Here's what happened

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We used to run through an iSight webcam

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And my little Mac laptop

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We used to run the webcam that way

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But the iSight got broken due to my stupidness

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And it no longer runs audio through it

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So what happened is that this past week

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I actually got a video camera

193
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Because I've been wanting a video camera anyway

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So I just figured two birds with one stone

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm gonna get a video camera

196
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We're gonna use it for Justin TV as well

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So that's what you see hooked up tonight

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We actually have now a video camera

199
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Running on Justin TV

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
However, here's why the resolution is crappy

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Because for some reason

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Even though the old Justin TV broadcaster

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Used to support 640x480 on the USB capture device

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It no longer does that

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So we have to use like 160

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But it's some really tiny tiny resolution

207
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So the picture's not great

208
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I apologize for that

209
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I will contact Justin TV

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And the people who make my card

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Try to figure out what's up with that

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But then the other thing is that the audio

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We were so close

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We were gonna have it running through the microphones

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But that didn't work out this week

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because with Loki running late

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We didn't have enough time to run all the wires

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
To the places they need to go

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So c'est la vie

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We're running as the audio through the actual camera tonight

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I still think it'll actually be better quality

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Than the iSight was

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Because as an actual video camera

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I think it has better quality

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But here's the other cool thing about what we have set up

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And what we hope to bring in the future

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is that on Justin TV

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
All we would have to do

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Is make a little switch

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Just like this

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And you guys won't hear this on the podcast

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But they'll see it on Justin TV

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You can actually go to live video of gameplay

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And playing right now on Justin TV

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is our old favorite 8-bit classic

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The Guardian Legend

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A little screenshot from there

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And you'll be able to see us kinda switch back and forth

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So we can actually like

240
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
If we talk about games

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And we happen to have them up

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We can switch just that easily

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Now here's the other problem

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Is that on Justin TV

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Just then

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Their audio completely cut out

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They only got the audio of the game

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They didn't hear us talking over that

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So that's the other thing we gotta fix

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But we're working on it

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Exciting things to come on Justin TV

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But since you guys have been crying the past few weeks

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like where's the webcam gone

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I wanna show you we've made some progress

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
We're trying

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We are a non-profit organization here at Orange Lounge Radio

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
K?

258
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Alright

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Alright

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So anyhow

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, shall we?

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If there's no other housekeeping tonight

263
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The only other thing I can think of is

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The old plugs for our communities

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We love to add people on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
On LiveJournal at Orange Lounge

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Or our Facebook community

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The O.L. Army

269
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's get to tonight's gaming news, Loki

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There's also the Orange Lounge Wiki

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
At Wikia

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh that thing is awesome too

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is how awesome our community is

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I put out a call on the forums this week

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm like, hi

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know anything about editing Wikis

277
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Like I'm not very good at it at all

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know the Wiki language

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I think Wiki's a wonderful concept

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I need to take my lazy ass

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And sit it down for a while and learn Wiki

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But the front page on the Wiki right now isn't working for me

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like I can't find things

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Can someone please clean up the front page

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Within 24 hours

286
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It looks great

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You go there now and it actually has all these articles

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Linked from the front page

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's awesome

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So if you haven't checked out the Wiki yet

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Orangeloungeradio.wikia.com

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A true product of our community

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They are awesome for doing that

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Alright

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well this is a rumor that never seems to die

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
CrunchGear, a tech blog, is actually reporting

297
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That an inside source at Microsoft

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Who was a former member of the company's

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
HD DVD department

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Has confirmed that the company will announce

301
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That the Xbox 360 will get Blu-ray

302
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Before Christmas via a press release

303
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's set to go out tomorrow morning

304
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Around 9-10ish

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Apparently the system

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They don't really have any info on it right now

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But it says it will cost less than an Elite system

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know

310
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This still seems far fetched

311
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I guess we'll just have to wait until tomorrow morning

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Now won't we

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well which will be today

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
By the time this show goes out

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So either we were really smart

316
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
In saying this in advance

317
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Or we're dumb

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But it seems like this rumor is always going around

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That Microsoft is going to be announcing Blu-ray

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What makes this special

321
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
All I think that they're going to be doing with this

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is just releasing another external thing

323
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's going to have

324
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Just like the HD DVD player

325
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I mean that would be the only way to do it

326
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's kind of fair to everybody

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because if you think about it

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you put this in the system

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Then you're going to have problems with the drive being too slow

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because that's what the problem is with the PS3

331
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And why you have to install all this shit on there

332
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is because the drive reads too slow

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So if they had it as an external device

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That way it puts everybody on level playing field

335
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you don't want it

336
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You don't have to buy it

337
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If you don't want it it's not going to cost you

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
As much as the system

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I think that's what they're probably going to have to do with this

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
If they do include it inside of a 360

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think it's going to be a dumb move

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hopefully

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I hope they tested all this stuff

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
To make sure that the access times are the same

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Because otherwise you're going to have a lot of problems reading games

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What is it about this particular report though

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Why I should believe it

348
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I think those people are just

350
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because I think that instead of just saying

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh it's coming

352
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's saying hey there's going to be a

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Press release tomorrow

354
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That says duh duh duh duh

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
At this time so it's a lot easier to say

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay well this is going to be true or false

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Instead of speculating whether it's true or not

358
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Now GK128 in our chat makes an interesting observation

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He says the new iPhone

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Is supposed to be tomorrow as well

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's half speculation

362
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Half Apple fanboys

363
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Always speak about this stuff in advance

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So they're probably right

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well here's the thing

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Tomorrow is the worldwide developers conference

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So is this Microsoft's answer to Apple

368
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
In a way like hey Apple's making this big unveiling

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And we're going to unveil Blu-ray in the home

370
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Is that what maybe gives us a little weight

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Maybe I don't know it'd just be weird

372
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Unless you know Microsoft

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean they're always kind of butting heads with Apple

374
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And stuff maybe they're trying to

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Get people on board with

376
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Their video download service and stuff like that

377
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know

378
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And you put the nail on the head there

379
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When they have their download service

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Alright they had the HD DVD player

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And to be honest

382
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I guess when I hear about Microsoft putting out a Blu-ray player

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You remember in the old Charlie Brown

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Comics when a character would get really upset

385
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
There'd be a little scribble drawn over their head

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's what I look like

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
When I keep thinking about how my HD DVD player

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Pretty much I only have five movies

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll ever be able to watch on it now

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We can still find movies all over the place though

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Usually really cheap

392
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But to know that there's no more

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Ever coming out on some of these newer movies

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I might want to get

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well we found out they were clearing out

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We went out and bought our player

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I bought my player full price

398
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's why I have angry

399
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Angry face

400
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Well there are always positives and negatives

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
To adopting early

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I know I know

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It just sucks

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Keep in mind

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Blu-ray being now the

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Preferred method

407
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Of high definition

408
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Media

409
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm expecting now to start seeing

410
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
More of the

411
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Less expensive models coming out

412
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Over the next year or so

413
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So you'll have an easier

414
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Time getting one in your hands

415
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
All the more reason not to buy this

416
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know

417
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Well I'm not going to buy the Blu-ray player because I know

418
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Eventually I'm going to get a PS3

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I realize I'm the only OLR host without a PS3

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And eventually I'm going to crack it

421
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well right now

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm not but Final Fantasy 13

423
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Is going to come out someday

424
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I am a Final Fantasy

425
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Fanboy I will be the first to admit

426
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When it comes out I have no choice

427
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I must upgrade to PS3

428
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Even if the game sucks it's Final Fantasy

429
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I have to get it

430
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I did the same thing for Final Fantasy 7

431
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I held out on getting a Sony

432
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
PlayStation for the longest time until Final Fantasy 7

433
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Came out and then I finally caved and bought

434
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
One and I'm glad I did because you guys all know

435
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Tons and tons of classic games on the PlayStation

436
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I hope the PlayStation 3 has

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A similar legacy but I don't know

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We'll see

439
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Rama and Chad agrees, Rob you're not missing anything

440
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hey before we get to the next story

441
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I missed one housekeeping thing, I'm such a jerk

442
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But it's because we were

443
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
In a hurry tonight with trying to set up all the new

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Fancy stuff for Justin TV which didn't

445
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Even end up working anyway, I forgot to script out

446
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What's going on for housekeeping tonight but I wanted to mention this

447
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Because I saw his name mentioned earlier

448
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
DJ, I'm sorry

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Mark Tetsuya says

450
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
DJ Tetsuya

451
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Maybe for tonight he's DJ Tetsuya

452
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
DJ Tetsuya said

453
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That SSJ 100 Matt is to

454
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank for a large part of how the

455
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Wiki got reorganized so thank you SSJ 100 Matt

456
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I also wanted to say as far as

457
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
SSJ 100 Matt goes that

458
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The Grand Theft Auto 4

459
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Contest was finally finished over

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Allgames.com this week, all the votes came in

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Sadly SSJ 100

462
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Matt did not win the contest

463
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm sure as you read

464
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sure as you read

465
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They sent me the console instead because they knew

466
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was the appropriate owner

467
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Of such a console

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But I do have some good news

469
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
SSJ 100 Matt did tie for third place

470
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So he does get something so that does kind of rock

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So congratulations

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The winner of the Grand Theft Auto 4

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Contest was the Bobby Black Wolf show

474
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And their little spoof on the Cheers ad that the guy made

475
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And so he walked away with the

476
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Limited edition

477
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Xbox 360 and I got to admit

478
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It was pretty funny

479
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It was definitely worthy

480
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We ended up voting for the Allgames Interactive one

481
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Which tied for second place

482
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Apparently, funny enough

483
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Only one vote got

484
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SSJ 100 Matt tied for third place

485
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Because Bobby's show got like four votes

486
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It was a runaway

487
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But do you know which show voted for us?

488
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Out of everybody?

489
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Bobby

490
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Because Bobby's the only one that probably

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Understood all the in-jokes

492
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's great

493
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So the winning show voted for us

494
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't know what that says

495
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But something to think about

496
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Something to think about

497
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's move on to more news

498
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Something else we like to think about

499
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Are music based games

500
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Lately music based games have been all about

501
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Guitar Hero and Rock Band

502
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
A brand new Guitar Hero game is coming out

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If you haven't heard, it's Guitar Hero Aerosmith

504
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith is scheduled to come out very soon

505
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And there are some songs

506
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That have been announced for the game

507
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm disappointed

508
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Well let me tell the songs first

509
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I want Fog Hat edition

510
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Tell your frustration

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We'll just give it a couple more years

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm sure that one of the billion releases will be the Fog Hat edition

513
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You get to play in such places as Nipmuc High School

514
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Maxis, Kansas City

515
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The Orpheum Theater, Halftime Show

516
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And Moscow

517
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Which is kind of cool that you get to play at places

518
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You know, like

519
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Aerosmith kind of played in, that's cute

520
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Some of the Aerosmith songs you can look forward to playing

521
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Sweet Emotion

522
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' an Elevator

523
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Dream On, Walk This Way

524
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And that is the version featuring Run DMC

525
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That's pretty rad

526
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And there's some other bands in the game too

527
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Funny enough, there's not a lot of the other bands

528
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Well I guess in a game called Guitar Hero Aerosmith

529
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It shouldn't be that surprising

530
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It usually breaks down that there's three Aerosmith songs in the stage

531
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And two other band songs

532
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And some of the other bands you'll see

533
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Cheap Trick with Dream Police

534
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Joan Jett, I Hate Myself for Lovin' You

535
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The Clash, Complete Control

536
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run

537
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And Run DMC with King of Rock

538
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So

539
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That's some of the stuff you have to look forward to

540
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
In Guitar Hero Aerosmith

541
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Which is coming out for the Playstation 3, 360

542
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And Playstation 2

543
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And if just the game wasn't enough, once you know it

544
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Bundles coming out as well

545
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So no excuses to say

546
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You can't play this game unless you just don't like Guitar Hero

547
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Or Aerosmith

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I like Aerosmith

549
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Or if you're not a consumer whore and realize

550
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Hey guess what?

551
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You can just wait a few more months and get an actual sequel to the game

552
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh Loki

553
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Achievements

554
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
A thousand points worth

555
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm not fucking playing that

556
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I do like Aerosmith though

557
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But I will

558
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't know

559
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Not buying a game just with Aerosmith

560
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Cause that's almost like buying an album

561
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't wanna buy albums anymore

562
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's a lot of album though

563
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's like 15 songs

564
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well I guess that's a normal album, nevermind

565
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
See what they're doing?

566
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Now we're charging you $50 for an album

567
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
They will never know what's actually happening

568
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You don't get to actually play your album

569
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Then again it's not real guitar

570
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not making a good case here

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Help Chat Room

572
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000

Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith

574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Ready? Go!

575
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The next story has to do with something that rather excites me

576
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
One of my favorite game series ever

577
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I'm not saying Metal Slug

578
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But it's Samurai Showdown

579
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
They actually said

580
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well from the ESRB

581
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That Xbox Live Arcade

582
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Would be getting Samurai Showdown 2

583
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And also now they're saying they should be getting Samurai Showdown

584
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I suppose they mean they're getting them separately

585
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
There's no news beyond what

587
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There's been on the ESRB

588
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So we can hope

589
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That they'll be all jazzed up and pretty

590
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Are we gonna get like all the Samurai Showdown games?

591
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Cause that's kind of a lot

592
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
What's so special about 5?

593
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
5 is the last cartridge that was released

594
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
On the Neo Geo cartridge system

595
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And I've never played it

596
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And I want it

597
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I want Samurai Showdown HD Remix

598
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You can do Samurai Showdown 5 HD Remix

599
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I want Samurai Showdown 2 though

600
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Most of all cause that one was like the best

601
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Huh

602
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
They had caffeine nicotine

603
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Nice

604
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Going back to the question that we asked earlier

605
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith

606
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Let's see, Kitsune says

607
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm not too thrilled about the new Guitar Hero

608
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
AJ Mix says it's not Guitar Hero Blink 182

609
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Kitsune follows up and says

610
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I think my husband might get it for the 360

611
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Robert M says

612
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I still can't find many of the Aerosmith songs on iTunes

613
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Gerardo says

614
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith, why?

615
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Because Guitar Hero makes it money

616
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Let's see, GS68 is hoping for

617
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Guitar Hero Loki Fusion

618
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't know about that one

619
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well here's the thing

620
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Activision is starting to get like

621
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Before people were saying, oh you're really hoarding this franchise

622
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well now they're just

623
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Not even trying to pretend that they're not

624
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They are just coming out with

625
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh by the way, hey if you don't want this

626
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Guitar Hero game, don't worry cause there's like four

627
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Other ones coming out within the foreseeable future

628
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Last couple comments

629
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
GK128 says Guitar Hero

630
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Insert band name here will always be a rental

631
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Unless it's something badass like Pixies or

632
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Dinosaur Jr. which you must be fanboys of

633
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Frisbee says

634
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Make Aerosmith a download pack

635
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And AZHP says

636
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It'll only be worth it if you actually like Aerosmith

637
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Aerosmith's kinda cool though

638
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I think what I'm talking about is

639
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Rockband has it figured out with the download packs

640
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Problem they're gonna run into with that though

641
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Is what they do for Rockband 2

642
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Because now you have like

643
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Rockband with all these songs

644
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And you can't

645
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Here, make all the old songs that you've already downloaded compatible

646
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Hopefully they do

647
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Just like they did with EDR

648
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And that's how they could sell more Guitar Hero Aerosmiths

649
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Is by saying, okay well all those download songs

650
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That you had will be compatible with this game

651
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Or you can download more

652
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And have them compatible with both games

653
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That would be smart

654
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Which is why they're not gonna do it

655
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Nintendo Maniac 64 says

656
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This is what we need, Guitar Hero F-Zero

657
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm not sure how that would work

658
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But it sounds good in theory

659
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It would be just like

660
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You know, the Rockband commercial where they're

661
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
On top of the bus, you know, playing their music

662
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But on top of an F-Zero

663
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's the intro to the game, isn't it?

664
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
What's that? That's the intro to the game

665
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I know, I know

666
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But still, that would be Guitar Hero F-Zero

667
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's playing music really fast

668
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
On a really, really, really fast car

669
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Flying through the air

670
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Or maybe instead of that normal note track you have

671
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You're actually on a car that's racing down

672
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
One of those super fast F-Zero tracks

673
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Doing loops and stuff

674
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And you have to read the notes off that

675
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That'd be kind of fun

676
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You know what would be cool?

677
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Is to actually combine

678
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The play levels for frequency

679
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
With Rockband

680
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

681
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And so

682
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
As you play through it, you twist up

683
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The path that they take and

684
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Form new designs and

685
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Get new effects that way

686
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Or if you really want an obscure reference

687
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You can just make a Guitar Hero

688
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Action game that's based off of

689
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Macross 7

690
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, that would be great!

691
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You get more points if you scream out

692
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Listen to my song, dammit

693
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
For those of us who are familiar

694
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
With Macross 7

695
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
All the mechs were based around music

696
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Rob, one of the biggest

697
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Points in Macross was that music

698
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Had a lot of power, which was how

699
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
In the very first series, spoiler!

700
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know, 20 years later

701
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
How in the first series they defeated the enemies

702
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That came by was because of stupid butt-head

703
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Mid-may

704
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And so Macross 7 is sort of a big play-off

705
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Of the whole music is power thing

706
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I gotta tell you though

707
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Going back to F-Zero for a minute

708
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I wanted to actually put in F-Zero GX

709
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And play it a little bit because it's still one of my favorite racers

710
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And I think I said this over on Bobby's show

711
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
When we were doing the tees tonight

712
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
There aren't a lot of racing games I really like outside

713
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Of F-Zero because F-Zero is fast

714
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And it's horrifically simple

715
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Like, that's what I like in a racing game

716
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I like Burnout because Burnout is fast too

717
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And it has explosions

718
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
There's not a lot of racing games I really, really love

719
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If they made a Burnout arcade game that would be pretty awesome

720
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That would be pretty awesome

721
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Alright, let's move on with more news

722
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So, of course

723
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Me being a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto

724
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Was a little bit disappointed to hear

725
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That the Grand Theft Auto

726
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Download content that's been promised for me

727
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Has been delayed to Fiscal Quarter 1 2009

728
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What's that mean?

729
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Well, that means

730
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That it's due between November 1, 2008

731
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And January 31, 2009

732
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Which when you look at it

733
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's not really that bad anyways

734
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But hey, still though

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I wish it was out a little bit sooner

736
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because, you know

737
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Because sooner is better!

738
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Exactly! And because you know

739
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm almost done with the game

740
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I need more achievements

741
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And also I need more stuff to do

742
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I hope they add tanks

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What about multiplayer?

744
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Multiplayer is fun

745
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Having some lag issues

746
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, not really lag issues

747
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But like disconnect issues

748
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But still love it

749
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Love the multiplayer

750
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We want to do instead of just killing each other

751
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We want to do like a team of four

752
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And go against another team of four

753
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You know, because our office would kick ass

754
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But so far it has

755
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Cock blocked this from doing such

756
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's like, nope, sorry

757
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You can't connect to anything

758
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Fuck you, bye

759
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't know

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's a really in depth message

761
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah, hey

762
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I was surprised to see that pop up too

763
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But you know, that's just how they roll

764
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
How they roll

765
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, it's alright though

766
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Because if the download content comes out later

767
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That gives me time to play Saints Row 2

768
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
In the middle, and oh god I want that game too

769
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know, I don't think Saints Row 2

770
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Came up on our show roll at all tonight

771
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Maybe it's because we talked a little bit about the delay last week

772
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But I guess a new trailer came out this week

773
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And it caused somebody, and I apologize I'm not crediting this

774
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But I don't have our forums up right now

775
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Somebody went to the forums and actually posted

776
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Dude, this looks like Loki the game

777
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I didn't watch the new trailer

778
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What's so great about it?

779
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What they were doing, the whole trailer was comparing

780
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 with Saints Row 2

781
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And mainly it was a trailer highlighting

782
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The side missions you can do in the game

783
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Because the side stuff you can do in Grand Theft Auto 4

784
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know, they have like

785
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Bowling and playing pool and darts

786
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And stuff like that

787
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Well, they were showing

788
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh hey, you can go and spray sewage

789
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
On people, you know

790
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Or you can do insurance fraud

791
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
With co-op and throw people in front of trains

792
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Or you can streak through the neighborhood

793
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Or you can rob stores

794
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And do all sorts of crazy stuff like that

795
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Hey, you know what

796
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Me being a fan of both games

797
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Both are great in their own aspects

798
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They're just different

799
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's like Star Wars and Spaceballs

800
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So competition is healthy

801
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Exactly, you know, I'm glad to see

802
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Because a lot of the stuff that came from Saints Row

803
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Ended up making it into

804
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

805
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The whole

806
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Their navigation systems

807
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Pretty much the same as Saints Row

808
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Using the cell phone for all the cheats

809
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And stuff like that

810
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
A lot from Saints Row

811
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Just, you know, the multiplayer

812
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Probably pushed them a little bit more

813
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
To do multiplayer on the platform, which is good

814
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, you know,

815
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Competition is good, I like to see that

816
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And also because Grand Theft Auto came out

817
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
That pushed Saints Row to add flying vehicles

818
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And stuff like that, so

819
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't care, they're both awesome

820
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You don't have to pick one

821
00:34:41,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Alright, if you want to check out the Saints Row 2 trailer

822
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
11 million copies sold to retailers

823
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So yes, that means about 2.5 million

824
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Are sitting on store shelves right now

825
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Waiting to be scooped up through the holiday season

826
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That was all reported in Take 2's

827
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Second Quarter Financials reported earlier this week

828
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So, not too shabby

829
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
11 million units sold to retailers

830
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Take 2

831
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Very happy campers right now

832
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Extremely happy campers

833
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I wish I could sell 11 million

834
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Units of one of my dream games

835
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'd be rich, I'd never have to work again

836
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Although we all know, I'm telling you, if Laser Cats the game came out

837
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That's like 25 million

838
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
25 billion

839
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Units

840
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't care, there's not that many people in the world

841
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But everybody would buy like 5 copies because it would be that awesome

842
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't you think?

843
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I smell another ET

844
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Uh oh

845
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You know, speaking of ET

846
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is going to sound so random

847
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But I don't care, I'm in a mood tonight

848
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I was on Wikipedia this week

849
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Reading about old school Atari games

850
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Like ET and Pac-Man

851
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And like why they failed

852
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And it was fascinating

853
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't know, just kind of reading up on my video game history

854
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I think it's good to brush up on your video game history once in a while

855
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because you played ET and you're like

856
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
How does anything like the movie?

857
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I don't get this

858
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I didn't get it when I was 5

859
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't get it now

860
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Forget it

861
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Can I do my story?

862
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Um, more Xbox Live

863
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Arcade news is

864
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Uh, Commando 3

865
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That's Wolf of the Battlefield

866
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Is going to be on

867
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Xbox Live Arcade as of I believe next Wednesday

868
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And will be 800 points

869
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And it also has an

870
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Invite to Super Street Fighter 2

871
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Turbo HD Remix beta

872
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So

873
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So I wonder how many percentage of the purchasers

874
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Of Commando 3 are actually trying to get the beta

875
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Like what happened with

876
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Crackdown and the Halo 3 beta

877
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Crackdown was pretty awesome

878
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But Crackdown was a pretty good game

879
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So hopefully Commando 3 is a pretty good game as well

880
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That would make it very worth it

881
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But I'm not a big fan of all these 800

882
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Price points lately

883
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Whatever happened to the $5 games?

884
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
When was the last time we got a $5 game?

885
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh wait, we had like Warlords and stuff

886
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I guess that wasn't really worth it though

887
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Well now that Penny Arcade came out for 1600 points

888
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Everyone's like, Hey!

889
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That game sells really well, it's $20

890
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Do anybody think there's a reason?

891
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Ah forget it

892
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They won't put 2 and 2 together

893
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Well we'll see

894
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
If you don't want to download that

895
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
There are some other things you can download

896
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Especially if you own Guitar Hero 3

897
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We're going to have some new Motorhead

898
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Tracks coming out

899
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's going to be part of

900
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
A series of tracks that they're going to have

901
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Coming out in June

902
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So the Motorhead Track Pack

903
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Which will be available June 5th

904
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I guess that's already come out then

905
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Includes, We Are The Road Crew

906
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Stay Clean and of course

907
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Motorhead

908
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And is available for 500 Microsoft points

909
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Or $6.25

910
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
In real money

911
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
The track that's coming out next week

912
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Which is the Isle of Wight

913
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That is coming out June 12th

914
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The price has been unconfirmed

915
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But it's probably going to be also 500 Microsoft points

916
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Includes, Shoot The Runner by

917
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Cosbian

918
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I Predict The Riot by Kaiser Chiefs

919
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And Problems by the Sex Pistols

920
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So that's pretty awesome

921
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Alright

922
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Well also speaking of ever expanding

923
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Games, Soul Calibur 4

924
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The roster of players just keeps

925
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Growing and growing

926
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And interestingly enough

927
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
When we got Darth Vader and Yoda

928
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Announced for Soul Calibur 4

929
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
People were kind of like, oh haha that's cute

930
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We're going to have these Star Wars characters

931
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
In the game that's going to be

932
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Kind of random

933
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But here's the weird thing

934
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Another Star Wars character

935
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Has been added to the Soul Calibur 4

936
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Roster

937
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So this is suddenly starting to feel like Star Wars

938
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Versus Soul Calibur or something weird

939
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Which I would not disapprove of

940
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I guess that's true

941
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's kind of neat in a weird way

942
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's just weird

943
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'll say it again

944
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
After I've played the game, we'll see

945
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But here's the deal

946
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The Secret Apprentice

947
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Is going to be in both versions of

948
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Soul Calibur 4

949
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Darth Vader is only going to be in the PS3

950
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
However the Secret Apprentice

951
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Now the Secret Apprentice comes from

952
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Star Wars The Force Unleashed

953
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
This guy is actually going to be

954
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
In Soul Calibur 4

955
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So check that out

956
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
When that game comes out a little later this year

957
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You know they need to put Bob Barker

958
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Into a fighting game

959
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Uh huh

960
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Bob Barker needs to be in a fighting game

961
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I mean that would be pretty badass

962
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Immortalize him, put him in another Soul Calibur game

963
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Soul Calibur versus Happy Gilmore

964
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't know about that

965
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
No, just like TV show hosts

966
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Just throw them in, random, it doesn't have to make any sense

967
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The Star Wars stuff doesn't make any sense

968
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Just throw it in

969
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So if it's TV show hosts, can he like beat up Rosie O'Donnell

970
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And Barbara Walters

971
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah sure, anything can happen

972
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Bob Barker, don't you know that he's held together by Clay

973
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And that formula from Death Becomes Her

974
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Celebrity Death Match

975
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That already was a game, wasn't it?

976
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Speaking of characters held together by Clay

977
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I know, really

978
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Maybe they just need Celebrity Death Match 2

979
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That would be great

980
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But you know what they should have if they did something like that

981
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Is have download characters

982
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And have it, you know, where you could

983
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Customize, you know

984
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
They have like, you know, like they do in the wrestling games

985
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So you can make different, you know

986
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
People, you know, mimic them

987
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
In wrestling games, you should have something like that

988
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Like Celebrity Death Match

989
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Could be, make your own celebrity

990
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
See what they need to do, they need to have more games

991
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm a celebrity, dammit

992
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I want to put myself in the game

993
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm an internet celebrity, I have a pen that says so

994
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
What they need to do is have more games that have that kind of same humor

995
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
As like Kung Fu Hustle, kind of like God Hand

996
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Where it's just ridiculous

997
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And more of like an anime style, you know

998
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That was more of a brawling game

999
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But, you know, more of like a fighting game

1000
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
With some like funny characters that are just really exaggerated

1001
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And stuff like that

1002
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur gets a lot of reaction from chat

1003
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Let's check this out, Gerardo says

1004
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Star Wars GTFO of my Soul Calibur

1005
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Go get your own fighting game

1006
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
No, they already did that

1007
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And that didn't turn out too well either

1008
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The Terrace

1009
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Then let Namco do it

1010
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Well, actually though, they're going to be doing something

1011
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
With the Force Unleashed on the Wii

1012
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Is going to have like a fighting game portion of it

1013
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Why don't they just put a Star Wars game

1014
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's based off the Soul Calibur engine

1015
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
GS68 says this is Soul Calibur

1016
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Not fucking Star Wars Calibur

1017
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Cheeseburger says Chuck Norris in Soul Calibur

1018
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Will roundhouse kick everyone

1019
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I dig that, he doesn't have a sword

1020
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He just has his roundhouse kicks

1021
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Why not, GS68 says

1022
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Luckily if anyone picks a Star Wars character

1023
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll pick Ivy and suffocate them to death

1024
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Sounds like fun

1025
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'd be like Boob Smash

1026
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Exactly, chat.ornisontraday.com

1027
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Is it my turn now, is it, is it, is it?

1028
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It is

1029
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yay, um, well

1030
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm sure people who've listened to this show

1031
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
For quite a while now know that I have an interest in law

1032
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I love

1033
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
What

1034
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But you are the law

1035
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Rob

1036
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What?

1037
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You know, I think that's an unhealthy obsession

1038
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That you have there with Tekken

1039
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I was just waiting for her to go

1040
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I am the law

1041
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I do have a Judge Dredd pinball machine

1042
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
In my house, thank you very much

1043
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
But um

1044
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
One of the former Supreme Court judges

1045
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Sandra Day O'Connor

1046
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Is wanting to make a game

1047
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That teaches court lessons

1048
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's called Our Courts

1049
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's a free game for kids between 12 and 15

1050
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And it basically

1051
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Lets you learn how

1052
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Courtrooms work, what the system is like

1053
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And learn

1054
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You know, actual legal issues

1055
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
When I was in school

1056
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
We used to do

1057
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Court simulations

1058
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Using modern day

1059
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I guess

1060
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The modern day courtroom system

1061
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
To judge

1062
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Historical acts, like I got to be Marie Antoinette

1063
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So I had to be really

1064
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Awesome

1065
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Did they behead you?

1066
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
First and foremost

1067
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Don't get me started on the French Revolution

1068
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Because

1069
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
No one wants to hear about that

1070
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Keep in mind

1071
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm a history buff

1072
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I love my history

1073
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Look, here, I'll retard the conversation

1074
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
A little bit

1075
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You know what we did in our school to practice courtroom?

1076
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
What?

1077
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We watched Nickelodeon Kids Court hosted by Paul Provenza

1078
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That's what we did

1079
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh

1080
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The other thing that we also did at my school

1081
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Was model United Nations

1082
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I got to be on the Security Council my senior year

1083
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And that was freaking badass

1084
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Because I had to tell both China and the US to shut up

1085
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What country did you represent?

1086
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Hungary

1087
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It was great

1088
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Hungary was on the Security Council that year

1089
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Considering that your life has evolved into

1090
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
A food podcast

1091
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
That sometimes talks about video games

1092
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That's really funny that you represented

1093
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Hungary

1094
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh come on

1095
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Home of the Habsburgs

1096
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Anyway

1097
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can't write this shit you guys

1098
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's all true

1099
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So anyway

1100
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's basically

1101
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
An educational game

1102
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Supposed to be put out so that children

1103
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Have a better understanding of how

1104
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The government works without having to

1105
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You know see the

1106
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Sort of farcical side of

1107
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Law enforcement with Grand Theft Auto

1108
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And those types of things

1109
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You know to actually see

1110
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Where your duties come in

1111
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I guess as far as

1112
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Participating in the system

1113
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I think it's a neat idea

1114
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And honestly it's something that I myself

1115
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Look into because I have

1116
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
An interest in it

1117
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I've taken a number of law classes

1118
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Through my various majors

1119
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Didn't you say it was only for kids 12-15?

1120
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It's targeted

1121
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's actually to be

1122
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Offered free to children

1123
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
12-15 years old

1124
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I know some people 25 years old that could benefit

1125
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
From that game

1126
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I want to give it a try

1127
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
She's actually quoted saying

1128
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It will allow students to engage in

1129
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Real legal issues

1130
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And it gives an example of

1131
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
A debate by someone

1132
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Wearing a controversial t-shirt

1133
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So I guess freedom of speech versus

1134
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You know how

1135
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Stupidly offended everybody in this

1136
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Country gets over people

1137
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Sneezing the wrong way

1138
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Sorry

1139
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Robert M. makes the mandatory Phoenix Wright reference

1140
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
By saying hold it

1141
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yes hold it

1142
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Anyways

1143
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So

1144
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
This is kind of interesting

1145
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There's been a couple stories

1146
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
That have come out recently about

1147
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Different gaming surveys

1148
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And oh my god what it means and stuff like that

1149
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah I have never seen anything about this

1150
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And this just totally slipped under the radar

1151
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
For everybody I think

1152
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Anyways

1153
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
There was a survey that went out to

1154
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Select people in the

1155
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Microsoft game studio

1156
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And it was a survey

1157
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Talking about different

1158
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Characters and what you thought about them

1159
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And stuff like that

1160
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Now the survey was for

1161
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
What they describe basically

1162
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Here's their description of it

1163
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
This game will be a game creator

1164
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And will provide a simple way to make

1165
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Your own games on the Xbox

1166
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Using just the Xbox controller

1167
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You can build worlds, populate

1168
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Them with characters and give the characters

1169
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Unique behaviors

1170
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You can easily build racing games

1171
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Platformers and adventure games without

1172
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Touching a keyboard or leaving your couch

1173
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So this is either XNA for dummies

1174
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Or little big planet thing

1175
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Exactly

1176
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Well what this is

1177
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Through the process of

1178
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Deduction I should say

1179
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's a game called

1180
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Or not even really a game

1181
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
A programming language called Boku

1182
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And Boku which you'll find out

1183
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
There actually are stories out there on the internet

1184
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm not exactly breaking any news here

1185
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Boku is a programming

1186
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Environment for children that runs on

1187
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Windows and the Xbox 360

1188
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And basically what makes it

1189
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Kind of different is it

1190
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Uses basically

1191
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Symbols like you have different objects

1192
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
For each symbol and you have

1193
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Kind of actions

1194
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And then other objects

1195
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So you kind of tie them all together without any programming language

1196
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So say you have a creature that looks like

1197
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Pac-Man or something like that

1198
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The Pac-Man character

1199
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Eat dots

1200
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And so that character will now seek out

1201
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The dots and try to eat them or something like that

1202
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's basically simple like that

1203
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But here's what I see

1204
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Happening with this

1205
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Sure they can make it just for children

1206
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But why not expand it to be a little bit more

1207
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Full featured and make it something that

1208
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Can compete with say

1209
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
XNA, well not even really compete with

1210
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But compete along with

1211
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I was going to say you don't want to compete against yourself

1212
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
With XNA or even say

1213
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Like a little big planet

1214
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
There's a bunch of screenshots of

1215
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You know characters and stuff that they had out there

1216
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And there's some other like

1217
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Links and stories and stuff showing

1218
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The programming environment

1219
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And the characters look interesting

1220
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's like everything from Pokemon looking characters

1221
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
To I don't know

1222
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Just some strange looking shit

1223
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
One of those things there looks like a pregnant Pac-Man ghost

1224
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I don't know what that is

1225
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Can you link that picture to our chat?

1226
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Looks like a pregnant Pac-Man ghost

1227
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But I just think it's really interesting

1228
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Now Dr. Seuss says

1229
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It sounds neat I wish there was a PC version

1230
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But this is something being developed across both platforms

1231
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It is going to be Windows and

1232
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
For the 360

1233
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
No idea though when it's going to be released

1234
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Or anything of that sense

1235
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But it looks like they're still working on it

1236
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
If they're sending out surveys about this thing

1237
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Why has this only been a blip on the gaming radar?

1238
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I don't know

1239
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Do people think there's not going to be interest in this?

1240
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Or what is it?

1241
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
The stuff that was covered here wasn't really in

1242
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It might have been just under the radar

1243
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Because there's no gaming related stuff

1244
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Kind of covered where this stuff was

1245
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It was basically at

1246
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
The Microsoft Research Tech Fest

1247
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
This came out in 2007

1248
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The Tech Fest 2007

1249
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So March of last year

1250
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Is when this

1251
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Originally was shown

1252
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And they only had it demoing

1253
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It was covered by WIRED

1254
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
They actually had a

1255
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Little piece on it

1256
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But that's about it

1257
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I don't know

1258
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It's very very interesting

1259
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I don't know

1260
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It could be something that's coming soon

1261
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Something maybe they'll show at E3

1262
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But if they are working on it

1263
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I think it could be pretty big

1264
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Because a lot of this stuff

1265
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The whole game 3.0 crap that they're trying to push

1266
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Where it's all user created content

1267
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Why not make it like a game creator?

1268
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
What, click and play?

1269
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
This old Maxis PC

1270
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Game making software is actually pretty cool

1271
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Vaguely, I actually do remember that

1272
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It was pretty cool, but make something like that

1273
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Maybe like LittleBigPlanet almost

1274
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But you can make your own games

1275
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Using this software and then distribute them

1276
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
To your friends or post them on

1277
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Some sort of integrated message board

1278
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Or something like that

1279
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
They're going to do the same thing with Blastworks

1280
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Which is coming out this week

1281
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That game is going to be pretty awesome

1282
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
This is the way

1283
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Things are going

1284
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'll link that picture in chat

1285
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
While you're waiting for more

1286
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Information on Boku

1287
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You can get some games a little bit sooner

1288
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Across the world, we like to cover release dates

1289
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We're going to start off in Japan tonight

1290
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Not a lot sadly coming out on the Xbox 360

1291
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
This week, but if we look at the Playstation 3

1292
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Hello, Metal Gear Solid 4

1293
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Guns of the Patriots

1294
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's this week in Japan, June 12

1295
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Is when you can get that

1296
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The Japanese language version

1297
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You can get over there, there's a premium pack

1298
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
A special edition

1299
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You know all the goodies

1300
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Because people in Japan love their limited edition stuff

1301
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So that is all coming out for Metal Gear Solid 4

1302
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And honestly because of it

1303
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
There's not a lot out there

1304
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
That really wants to compete with it this week

1305
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Nintendo Wii has nothing coming out

1306
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Playstation 2 has nothing coming out

1307
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Now the Nintendo DS has a little bit

1308
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Coming out, but not a lot

1309
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
A game called Breath

1310
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Oua Akaneiro is coming out on June 12th

1311
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
As well as another Pachinko game

1312
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That has to do with Neon Genesis Evangelion

1313
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Is coming out

1314
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Just because we didn't have enough Evangelion

1315
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Games on the DS

1316
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But I'm looking at what this Breath game is all about

1317
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And trying to figure out what this is

1318
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It looks like an adventure game

1319
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm trying to figure out if it's another dating sim

1320
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Because it definitely looks like you have

1321
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Cute girls on the top screen

1322
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And text on the bottom screen

1323
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's usually a good sign of a dating sim

1324
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And also coming out in Japan

1325
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Othello de Othello DS

1326
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Which I'm assuming is just the classic game

1327
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You might know as Reversi

1328
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yeah, it is

1329
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Othello

1330
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
The old school game

1331
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And also coming out on the Nintendo DS

1332
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Sekai wa Atashi de Mowateru

1333
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Is coming out

1334
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Which is a

1335
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
RPG game

1336
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
From Global A Entertainment

1337
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And quickly glancing to see

1338
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
If there's anything on the PSP of note

1339
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Or if Metal Gear is just dominating

1340
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
The Sony universe this week

1341
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Medical 91 for portable

1342
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Is listed for the Sony PSP

1343
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
That is a game

1344
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's not Trauma Center, I'll tell you that

1345
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It's an adventure game

1346
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There's no screenshots, I couldn't tell you more about that

1347
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
But looks like there's one lone game

1348
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
On the PSP this week, but otherwise

1349
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Not a lot wanting to compete with Metal Gear Solid 4

1350
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This week over in Japan

1351
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Well we do have our UK releases

1352
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
If anyone is interested

1353
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
We have on the 12th

1354
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Metal Gear Solid Online and

1355
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots

1356
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Don King presents Prize Fighter

1357
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Whatever, that's on the 13th

1358
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
More on the 13th is Doodle Hex

1359

And Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution

1364
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

1365
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Alright

1366
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The US, there's actually

1367
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Quite a bit coming out

1368
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Of course this week, you know, Metal Gear Solid 4

1369
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's obviously going to be the biggest one

1370
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
On PS3

1371
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Also coming out, NASCAR 09

Looney Tunes Cartoon Conductor

1380
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That's the one if you may remember

1381
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's a rip-off of

1382
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Elite Beat Agents

1383
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That will be coming out on the DS

1384
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000

On PlayStation 3 and

1392
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And finally, Blastworks

1393
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Build, Trade, and Destroy on the Wii

1394
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
If you own a Wii, you must buy this game

1395
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm telling you right now, buy this fucking game

1396
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Huh

1397
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It's an awesome shooter game

1398
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Everything's customizable in it

1399
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You can build your own levels

1400
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm thinking we should run a contest based on it

1401
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But, you know

1402
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know, it looks awesome

1403
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I plan on picking it up when it comes out

1404
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Alright

1405
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Tomiki Fighters, you mean?

1406
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Well yes, it's basic, well it's not exactly

1407
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Tomiki Fighters, they do have Tomiki Fighters

1408
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
in there as an unlockable game

1409
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But it is completely rebuilt

1410
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And it's a lot more than just

1411
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Tomiki Fighters, it's not just a rip-off

1412
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's got a lot of stuff to offer

1413
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So, definitely check it out

1414
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Did the company pay you to plug them?

1415
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
No, the company does not pay me to plug it

1416
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I think it looks really good

1417
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And they're gonna have this whole Blastworks Depot

1418
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
thing where you can upload and download objects

1419
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
created by other people

1420
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
For example, you can take this and make your own

1421
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Star Fox game

1422
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You can take this and make another Guardian Legends game

1423
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
if you wanted to

1424
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Stuff like that

1425
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I think it has a lot of

1426
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Especially, everybody's into the whole customizing stuff

1427
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Making custom levels for Smash Brothers

1428
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That was pretty simple

1429
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Look at this, this thing, people should run with this

1430
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Alright

1431
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Well, hey, if you want to get something a little sooner

1432
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
as in right now, the PlayStation Network

1433
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
was created on Thursday and they added quite a bit

1434
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
of new things

1435
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They added something called Core, which we're gonna talk a little more about in Part B

1436
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
But they also added some new downloadable games

1437
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Wolf of the Battlefield, Commando 3

1438
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
came out this week, $10

1439
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
As well as Nova Strike

1440
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Some new things came out for Guitar Hero 3

1441
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
including the new God of War song

1442
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
we talked about a few weeks ago

1443
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It did finally come out this week

1444
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Some new demos for you guys, including Civilization Revolution

1445
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000

1446
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and NASCAR 09

1447
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
for some varying games

1448
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Hail to the Chimp

1449
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000

1450
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Lego Indiana Jones, slightly cooler

1451
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000

The trailer is up for that

if you're interested in checking that out

1454
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Also some new themes, a retro theme

1455
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
has come out for the PlayStation 3

1456
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm not sure what type of retro that is

1457
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
How retro could that be?

1458
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Maybe PS1 graphics

1459
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's all Betamax

1460
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That should be kind of rad

1461
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It comes up with the beta logo

1462
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and then a bunch of

1463
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo 2

1464
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
stuff in the PC

1465
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
PlayStation Store

1466
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
TV spots, wallpaper

1467
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and the whole freaking game

1468
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
itself, if you want that

1469
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So check that out, PlayStation Network

1470
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
updates this week

1471
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Another thing that's been updated

1472
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
is Sega's calendar

1473
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It looks like Sonic Unleashed

1474
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
is going to be out in November

1475
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
but other things people might have been

1476
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
waiting on like Aliens

1477
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Colonial Marines

1478
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and Empire Total War

1479
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
are both going to be out in 2009

1480
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But the Beijing

1481
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Olympics game is going to be out on the 27th

1482
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
of June and on August 27th

1483
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
is a

1484
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
game called Space Siege which is by

1485
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
GasPowered Games

1486
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Other things that are set to be out

1487
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
is the Golden Axe

1488
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I guess a revamp

1489
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
of it, Sonic Chronicles Bioware

1490
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Role Playing Game

1491
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and Picto Image DS

1492
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
also

1493
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
a sequel to

1494
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yakuza

1495
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I hate to say this because I know Sega

1496
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
is near and dear to your heart and I don't know how you feel

1497
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
about this series but Golden Axe

1498
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
was something that was way cooler when I was a kid

1499
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I love Golden Axe

1500
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I love Golden Axe the Duel a whole lot too

1501
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I went and I downloaded

1502
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
the Genesis version on Virtual Console

1503
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and I was just kind of like

1504
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
oh my god this game is like repetitive and boring

1505
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
it was so much better when I was a kid

1506
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't know what it is

1507
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
but somehow the charm, the magic was lost

1508
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
maybe it was because I wasn't playing with friends

1509
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
at a pizza joint

1510
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
you know what I mean? Games like that are always much funner with friends

1511
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
because couldn't you like hit each other in that game

1512
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
like if you're on that little purple bird

1513
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
looking thing you could hit your friends over

1514
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
that was always pretty rad

1515
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
yeah and that purple bird thing would be something that you're riding

1516
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
like in

1517
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Golden Axe Beast Rider

1518
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
well I do still think

1519
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
you know what I always loved about Golden Axe

1520
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I would check out a revamped version of it

1521
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
because you know what I always loved about Golden Axe

1522
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
was the ending, wasn't the ending

1523
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
the best thing ever in Golden Axe

1524
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
where they actually came out of the arcade game

1525
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
spoilers, sorry

1526
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I was gonna say

1527
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
one of the games she forgot mentioning there

1528
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
of course

1529
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
we're gonna like this game on the Wii

1530
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
uh

1531
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Someday Amigo, that's out this summer

1532
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
nice

1533
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
but only if there's like fake maracas

1534
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I love maracas

1535
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
you know someone's gonna release

1536
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
a maracas attachment

1537
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
they will, they've talked about the little

1538
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
plastic sleeves and silly things

1539
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and besides, if they don't

1540
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
what a difference duct tape

1541
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and maracas can make

1542
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
all you need to do is order more free

1543
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
condoms for your controller

1544
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
seriously, we should do

1545
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
okay, you know what we should do?

1546
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
the Orange Jones Radio edition maracas

1547
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I love it

1548
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and we make them out of paper mache

1549
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
like you used to do in kindergarten

1550
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
we'll get all the supplies at Michael's

1551
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
we will, you can actually just buy gourds

1552
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
and duct tape a gourd to it, that'd be fantastic

1553
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
if you don't live

1554
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Michael's is all across the US, right?

1555
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I think so

1556
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
it's a craft store, if you live abroad

1557
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
even though you've visited a Michael's

1558
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
let me just put it that way

1559
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
it's a great little craft store

1560
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
anyway, forget it

1561
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
dude, okay, I've been spending so much time

1562
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
with stuff I have to get at Michael's

1563
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
that, okay

1564
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm gonna make maracas

1565
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
just you watch, I'll make them

1566
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
put it on YouTube and all that stuff

1567
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
we have a YouTube channel we don't use for anything

1568
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
your hands can be, right?

1569
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
yeah, I've actually thought about buying

1570
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
a tub of the fondant there one time

1571
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
cause that stuff tastes like those animal cookies

1572
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
but it's really not good for you

1573
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
alright, forget it, move on, move on

1574
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
so something that has nothing to do

1575
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
with Michael's

1576
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
unfortunately

1577
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
it's, you know, sad to see

1578
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
that Itagagi has

1579
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
left Tecmo

1580
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
so you're not gonna see

1581
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
him helming anymore Ninja Gaiden

1582
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
or Dead or Alive games

1583
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
at least not with Team Ninja

1584
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I

1585
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I don't know why he left

1586
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
but I guess just

1587
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
you know

1588
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
emotional distress

1589
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I guess

1590
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
worsening personal relationships

1591
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and work environment

1592
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
if I remember right, wasn't there something about unpaid overtime

1593
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
too, or something that factored into it?

1594
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I'm sure there is

1595
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
basically he's a very disgruntled employee right now

1596
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
he's a rock star, he can't be like, you know, tied down

1597
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
with a job and stuff, he has to be trashing hotel rooms

1598
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Itagaki is a fucking rock star

1599
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
you don't see a lot of

1600
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
gaming rock stars

1601
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Itagaki is a rock star

1602
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
they need him to hang out with

1603
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
say the guy that does the

1604
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Castlevania games

1605
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
just like make this really kick ass

1606
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
guitar wolf

1607
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
programming team that just

1608
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
fucking says, they come in

1609
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
they kick over the microphone and they're like fuck this

1610
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
you're buying our fucking game and everyone's like

1611
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
hell yeah I am!

1612
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
so that's how they need to do it

1613
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
just like scare the crap

1614
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
out of the press, that'd be awesome

1615
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
just come in, set something on fire

1616
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
throw it into the crowd

1617
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
just like, that's how you

1618
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
sell your game

1619
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
women coming out and wearing

1620
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
nothing but you know

1621
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
skippy ass clothing, they don't fucking

1622
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
care if it's offensive, they're just like

1623
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
whatever man, just some fabric

1624
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
they bought at Michael's, that's all

1625
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
whip cream, that's it

1626
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
just whip cream

1627
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
barbecue condiments

1628
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Itagaki is a rock star

1629
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
so he'll go on to doing something

1630
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm sure

1631
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
just hopefully he doesn't decide to go

1632
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
develop playground equipment

1633
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
like a certain other people

1634
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
unless the playground equipment

1635
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
electrocutes children

1636
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
that I can see

1637
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and has fake boobs that are on it

1638
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
yeah yeah

1639
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
that's what he does in the middle of the presentation

1640
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
just a motorboat right there

1641
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
busts out with that

1642
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
buy our game

1643
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
how come you never see someone like him

1644
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
busted for destroying hotel rooms?

1645
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
that's what I want to know

1646
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
just wait for this year's E3

1647
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
you know, that could be the rock band sequel

1648
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
no, keep in mind

1649
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
instead of

1650
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't know

1651
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
but keep in mind

1652
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
you have rock band the RPG

1653
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
where you know, you go and you trash

1654
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
hotel rooms and have groupies

1655
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
and you know, that type of thing

1656
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
wouldn't that be awesome?

1657
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
how about video game rock band or something

1658
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
because you could play as Itagaki

1659
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
alright, maybe not

1660
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
you know, Itagaki's got his own thing going on

1661
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
he's cool

1662
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
he wants to have champagne

1663
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and only green M&M's

1664
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
if anyone gets that reference

1665
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
that's awesome

1666
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
by the way, if you get that reference

1667
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
you're awesome

1668
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
because that's a true rock star right there

1669
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
somebody who fucking demands

1670
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
only green M&M's

1671
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
just to see if someone will do it

1672
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
more points to somebody who gets that joke

1673
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
alright, anyhow

1674
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
what?

1675
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Africa

1676
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
onto things less cool

1677
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
actually, I take that back

1678
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
because this game was kind of like the running joke

1679
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
of E3 a couple years ago

1680
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
because they didn't tell us anything about the game

1681
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
there was nothing told about the game

1682
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
well guess what, finally

1683
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
finally with this game just around the corner

1684
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
for release in Japan very soon

1685
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
some details have come out about the game

1686
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Africa, you're going to be a photo journalist

1687
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and you can take pictures on foot

1688
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
in a car or by air balloon

1689
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
which is kind of rad, because you don't see hot air balloons

1690
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
make many gaming appearances

1691
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and you can unlock

1692
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
non-CG pictures

1693
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
and actual research footage

1694
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
of animals as you encounter animals

1695
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
in-game

1696
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
and it comes out on August 28th

1697
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
you build up this animal library

1698
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
well great, I would like to know as much as possible

1699
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
about the things I'm running over in my jeep

1700
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I don't think

1701
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
you can do that in the game

1702
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
dammit

1703
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
so basically it's Africa Snap

1704
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
but it doesn't sound like it's on a track

1705
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
it sounds kind of a whole lot cooler

1706
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
it's going to be a trailer for the game

1707
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and with the graphics and all

1708
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I've got to say, it does look like

1709
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
potentially, it's going to be a very kick-ass

1710
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I don't even know if you really call it a game

1711
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
like a kick-ass thing

1712
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
it looks really neat

1713
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I've got to say

1714
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
so maybe we'll all end up eating crow

1715
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
about making fun of this game at E3

1716
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
a few years ago

1717
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
but it actually looks kind of neat

1718
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
so I want to check this out

1719
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
right, and then Aya Judgment is going to be awesome too

1720
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
oh wait, no, I mean you really got to check out the preview

1721
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
it kind of, like the graphics look gorgeous

1722
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
absolutely gorgeous

1723
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
yeah, they do look gorgeous

1724
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
great, what does it say about the gameplay?

1725
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
nothing, exactly, and the gameplay could suck

1726
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
and this game could still suck

1727
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
but I'm just saying, there's hope

1728
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
there is hope, before we had no hope

1729
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Africa was just the running joke

1730
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
but now that we're finding out a little bit about it

1731
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
it sounds interesting

1732
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
exactly, just like Frisbee says in the chatroom

1733
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Africa equals Endless Ocean

1734
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
yes, pretty much

1735
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
and how did Endless Ocean do?

1736
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
not very well, how did

1737
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
there was another Safari game that was on the Wii

1738
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
that sucked

1739
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
that's the only Safari game that did any

1740
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
and this is not even really a Safari game

1741
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but a similar game that did

1742
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
you know, really well was Pokemon Snap

1743
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I'm going to guess that's because it had Pokemon in it

1744
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
have we ever had like a really kick-ass

1745
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Safari game, like Jumbo Safari

1746
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
of course, but

1747
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
that's just an arcade game, people like that game

1748
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
eat moves and you're going really fast

1749
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and you're catching animals

1750
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and you can throw harpoons

1751
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
harpoons make every game better

1752
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
add that to the list of things

1753
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
that make games better

1754
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
1 Dragonforce, 2 harpoons

1755
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
3 Pokemon

1756
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
who didn't love Scorpion in the first Mortal Kombat

1757
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Pokemon does not make things better

1758
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
stop that

1759
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
that is wrong

1760
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Pokemon has flavor

1761
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
eating Pokemon would make a game better

1762
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
number 1 thing that makes games better

1763
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Dragonforce

1764
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
by the way, they have a new album coming out

1765
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
do what?

1766
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
number 2, things that make games better

1767
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
harpoons

1768
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
3, the other things that make games better

1769
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
fire, shooting hookers

1770
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
we need to get them on the show promoting their album

1771
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I will send them an email

1772
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
right after the show, I will

1773
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
alright

1774
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
however we have some other business to take care of

1775
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
real quick

1776
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Tigerclaw says in chat

1777
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
the real question is

1778
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
will Africa show animals doing it?

1779
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
yes!

1780
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
since it's supposed to stimulate

1781
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
stimulate the wildlife

1782
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
well we know where my brain is

1783
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
since it's supposed to simulate

1784
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
wildlife, what do wildlife often do?

1785
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Frisbee says

1786
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Africa, rated M for strong sexual content

1787
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
2 things, 1, animals fuck

1788
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
2, monkeys throw poo

1789
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
the end

1790
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
did you see that, someone says

1791
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
and it had the pester ball

1792
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
did you see that

1793
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
there's a little robotic camera

1794
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
that you can drive around

1795
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and take pictures with

1796
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
in Africa?

1797
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
yeah, it looked like a Mars lander

1798
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I can't wait to annoy things with that

1799
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
that's it

1800
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Darktessia's got it

1801
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
instead of doing Africa, they should do

1802
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Jurassic Park

1803
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
with a cam

1804
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
and you could drop lawyers in there

1805
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
and watch them eat people

1806
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
were you trying to avoid getting eaten by a

1807
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
velociraptor?

1808
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
no, you have a robot camera

1809
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
dude, taking a trip down memory lane

1810
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
for a minute, and we're about to get into the

1811
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
classic game a week, so this is okay

1812
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I don't know if you remember this game

1813
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
the original Jurassic Park game that was on

1814
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Super Nintendo, it boasted

1815
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
it was one of the first games that used surround sound

1816
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
and all this stuff, now here's the thing

1817
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
the game was kind of split into two parts

1818
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
there was an overworld thing

1819
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
that was kind of generic, like it was your basic

1820
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
3D

1821
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
ISO type view, where you go

1822
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
around the world collecting things, whatever

1823
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
but then you went into this mode, which was like

1824
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
first person, Doom type thing

1825
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and I'll tell you what, if you played that game with all the lights

1826
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
out and everything back in the game

1827
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
that mode was scary as hell

1828
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
because you would be walking around

1829
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and suddenly a velociraptor comes out of nowhere

1830
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and crawls your eyeballs out and it's over

1831
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and it was scary

1832
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
did you ever play that game?

1833
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
it was freaky, and then Hitler comes out

1834
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
in the robotic machine

1835
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
but I was at just two lanes one time

1836
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
back when they had an arcade and not a pro shop

1837
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
and they had

1838
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
for some reason their Jurassic Park

1839
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
shooter game was broken

1840
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
and so I got to play on free play

1841
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
the whole time, so I had beaten the arcade one

1842
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
you know what, I'm very disappointed in him

1843
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
this is totally off topic, but that's fine

1844
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
off topic, us, who?

1845
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
this show, off topic?

1846
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
it has to do with games

1847
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
where the hell is the fucking Silent Hill arcade game

1848
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
locally?

1849
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
hey, that's a very good question, what the hell ever happened to that game?

1850
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
no one has imported that shit

1851
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
that is a damn good question

1852
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
let's buy one

1853
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
we could put it in the corner right there, that works

1854
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm down, we could just liquidate the funds

1855
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Loki will be very happy at this news

1856
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
guess what the OLR studio is getting next week?

1857
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
a couch

1858
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
we are getting a couch, and I'm thinking we're gonna put it right there

1859
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
where Loki usually sits

1860
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
by the way, I'm going to

1861
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
buy us an air conditioner

1862
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
sweet

1863
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
with the funds that were donated to us

1864
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
hooray

1865
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and we're going to put it in that window

1866
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and we're not gonna burn our asses off

1867
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
here in the studio

1868
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
it's not that bad

1869
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
not right now, but wait until August, hello

1870
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
well we could get more fans, I don't know, we'll get the damn air conditioner

1871
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
you know what, we need

1872
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
a game called beat the heat

1873
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
where you actually take like, pockets of heat

1874
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and beat them to death

1875
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
one other quick thing about Jurassic Park, wasn't it weird

1876
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
that the Genesis version of Jurassic Park was like

1877
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
a completely fucking different game

1878
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
it was like, it was more of a side scroller

1879
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
it was better

1880
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
he could play as the velociraptor and kill people

1881
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
true, alright, there you go

1882
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
just about everything was different

1883
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
you know, for games that would come out on one system

1884
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
versus the other

1885
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
look, nostalgia is awesome

1886
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and all, but we have another segment we do

1887
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
here on Orange Lounge Radio

1888
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
it's a chance for us to

1889
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
it's nostalgic too?

1890
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
it is, very nostalgic, it's a chance for us to pay tribute

1891
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
if you will, to the elders

1892
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
of gaming, what?

1893
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I had a list of two

1894
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and thanks to Sauce

1895
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I had a list of one

1896
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
well you'll just use the other one next week, won't you?

1897
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I'll probably forget

1898
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and I had to go in the vault to pick this again too

1899
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
look, look

1900
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
this is the last video game of the week

1901
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
for you kids to dig up and play

1902
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
and Dark Sakura

1903
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
is dug through the archives with Sauce

1904
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
the archives?

1905
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
what is wrong with me tonight? I'm broken, malfunction, malfunction

1906
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
alright, uh

1907
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
exterminate

1908
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
exterminate, what is the classic game

1909
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
the kids should be playing this week?

1910
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Space Channel 5

1911
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
cheeseball, cheeseball, cheeseball

1912
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:59,000
play some music!

1913
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
oh did I miss it?

1914
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
you want me to go back to it?

1915
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Space Channel 5

1916
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,220
And this one is obviously from the Japanese version, but her voice actor in America was

1917
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,300
Apollo Smile, who was supposed to be like the blooming anime girl who's actually kind

1918
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,300
of a big hoe.

1919
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:49,680
But with this one though, it is technically a music slash puzzle game.

1920
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:58,640
And so the whole point of this is that you run into these little aliens called Melodians.

1921
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,140
And it's funny when you have your load screen that says Now Meloding, which I felt was pretty

1922
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,140
good.

1923
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:08,440
Anyway, they'll name out a direction and then maybe a shoot button, and you have to mimic

1924
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
it when it's your turn.

1925
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,960
And it has to be perfectly in time with the same rhythm that they did.

1926
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:19,320
So you have to have a really good sense of rhythm and keep up with it.

1927
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:25,120
As you go through, you also have like a little heart blast where you can rescue people.

1928
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,720
And so as you're going through the game, if you rescue people, they join your little entourage

1929
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,960
that walks behind you.

1930
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,800
And like in the last level, you can actually get Space Michael, as in Michael Jackson.

1931
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,560
There's also a Game Boy Advance one that I didn't play because I refused to.

1932
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:49,240
And Rez had a Merolian in it as one of the evolutions for the characters.

1933
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,200
So that was pretty cool.

1934
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,240
There's also the Space Channel 5 minigame in Sega Superstars.

1935
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,720
There's a Sonic, uh, the, the, um, Ulala is a hidden character in Sonic Riders.

1936
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:05,920
Um, there's actually a girl who looks like Ulala in Phantasy Star Universe around Chapter

1937
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,920
10.

1938
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,960
She's the news reporter for Gerhal Channel 5 News.

1939
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,960
And it's her theme song.

1940
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,960
I've seen that.

1941
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,960
She's in the, she's in the add-ons too.

1942
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,400
Um, Ulala and Pudding are playable characters in, uh, Sega Superstars Tennis.

1943
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,760
Pudding is like her rival.

1944
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,600
Um, Pudding is also one of the best video game characters ever.

1945
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,960
Um, there's also, um, Space Channel 5 Part 2 and, um, something actually Rob, do you

1946
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960
like D-Lite?

1947
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,960
The group D-Lite?

1948
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,400
I, I like the one song that everybody knows by D-Lite.

1949
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,400
Quick name two D-Lite songs.

1950
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,280
Those grooves in the heart that everyone knows.

1951
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,480
And I have like, um, their, uh, one of their, uh, their later albums.

1952
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,040
I thought it was really good.

1953
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:50,040
But, um, Lady Miss Keir, who is their, their singer, actually, um, opened a lawsuit against

1954
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:57,040
Sega for, uh, basing Ulala off of her without her permission.

1955
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,400
And, uh, Hippolytus is in chat right now and knows quite a bit about, uh, D-Lite.

1956
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,480
Apparently they split up years ago and Keir Kirby and DJ Dimitri married.

1957
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,800
And, uh, Talate was in that group too and he does remixes for like everybody.

1958
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,800
They were confusing.

1959
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,200
But, um, anyway, the way that that went is that, um, Sega, um, offered her $16,000 for

1960
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,640
licensing and to use their songs.

1961
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,800
And she refused and they went ahead and made the game anyway, but she lost the lawsuit

1962
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:28,200
and had to pay, um, Sega's regal worth of, uh, $608,000.

1963
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:34,680
So, um, and actually that was Michael Jackson doing his own voice acting in the game, by

1964
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,680
the way.

1965
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,680
Because Michael Jackson loves Sega.

1966
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,840
Didn't he only say, like, two things in the game, though?

1967
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,520
He said, thank you, Ulala, and- Sega made that frickin' Moonwalker game, which was all

1968
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,520
kinds of badass.

1969
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,520
I know.

1970
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,120
He had a whole big- in Space Channel 5 Part 2, there's a whole part of the game that's

1971
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,120
doing nothing but buy the Jackson dances.

1972
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,120
Yeah, it's pretty rad.

1973
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,120
It's freakin' cool.

1974
01:15:54,120 --> 01:16:00,560
And I really love Space Channel 5 too, but, um, but this, um, this was, like, the game

1975
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,560
for me.

1976
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,560
Space Channel 5.

1977
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,560
I love this game.

1978
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,440
Let's get to the, um, boss music, because it's really awesome.

1979
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,760
This is the other big thing, is the great music in the game.

1980
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:15,760
I remember this stage.

1981
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:36,760
Gerardo mode, boops, he says, the first level of my favorite song is the same.

1982
01:16:36,760 --> 01:17:04,600
This is my favorite music in the game, because it's all shit, shit, shit.

1983
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,440
It gets stuck in your head.

1984
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,440
So easily.

1985
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,440
That's the crazy thing about this game.

1986
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,040
Well, it's better to- it's easier to tell it in the American version, because it's either

1987
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:17,360
chew or shoot, or, uh, or heart or something, no, it's- what is the other thing she said

1988
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,360
if it- she says chew and she shoots them, and it's something else when, you know, when,

1989
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,360
uh, she saves people.

1990
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Hey, I think is what they say.

1991
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,640
But anyway, um, Space Channel 5 too, though, had, like, um, my favorite bad guy in any

1992
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,640
game ever, though.

1993
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,360
And that was the three robots that had the speakers coming out of their head that would

1994
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,360
sing, like, to the, uh, barbershop quartet.

1995
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,360
I think I remember that.

1996
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
They were awesome.

1997
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,160
But, um, we need- we need more Space Channel 5, we need more Lala.

1998
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,960
It'll be awesome.

1999
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:49,920
All right, Space Channel 5 is your classic game of the week, available on the Dreamcast,

2000
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,960
um, also- And PlayStation 2.

2001
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,000
Repackaged for PlayStation 2, that's right.

2002
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,400
So check it out on either of those systems- would you say they're both good, or you need

2003
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
to actually check it out?

2004
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Dreamcast!

2005
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Yeah, that's what I figured.

2006
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,080
Actually- You always pick Dreamcast games.

2007
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,080
Actually, actually, actually, Rob.

2008
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,080
What?

2009
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:11,520
I have to say that I do have, um, Space Channel 5 2 on PlayStation 2, and it was really good.

2010
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,780
And I have played Space Channel 5 on PlayStation 2, and it was also very good.

2011
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,120
It was a very good port.

2012
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,120
All right.

2013
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,120
Very cool.

2014
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,120
All right, I have a request.

2015
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,400
Next week, I'm going to challenge you to pick something not Sega.

2016
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:31,000
But- I haven't done Sega- I don't- what was- okay, last week was Sega.

2017
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The week before that- oh, the week before that was Sega.

2018
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah, exactly.

2019
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
The week before that.

2020
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The week before that.

2021
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Go check the wiki.

2022
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm just giving you a hard time.

2023
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Pick whatever the hell you want.

2024
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
But- but Sega's awesome.

2025
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Sega is awesome.

2026
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I want to hear something creepy.

2027
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
What?

2028
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And not related to Sega in any way.

2029
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Okay.

2030
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
They're making another Barbie Horse Adventures game.

2031
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
The fuck?

2032
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Okay.

2033
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Chat room.

2034
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
People who update our wiki.

2035
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,200
I need someone who has, um, elite skills in Excel or Access to, um, uh, put everything

2036
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:01,520
into a spreadsheet and see what the percentage of games that I have picked that are Sega.

2037
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
All right.

2038
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Thank you.

2039
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
Thank you.

2040
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,520
Thank you.

2041
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,520
It's in Excel.

2042
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,520
It's freaking easy.

2043
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,520
AJ Mix says eight Sega games.

2044
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,520
Okay.

2045
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
Overall.

2046
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,520
I guess.

2047
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
That's not that bad.

2048
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,520
That's not that bad.

2049
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,520
All right.

2050
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,520
Look, I'm just giving her a hard time.

2051
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
That's what I do here on the program.

2052
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
That's what they pay me to do.

2053
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,520
But I have to give a hard time back by having no sense of humor.

2054
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
All right.

2055
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,520
Rob?

2056
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,520
What?

2057
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,040
We're going to take a well-deserved break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2058
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,840
When we come back, more of Orange Lounge Radio, including the taping of part B, will be back

2059
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,200
right after this here on Orange Lounge Radio.
