Orange Lounge Radio
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco
Tonight, June 22, 2008, the PSP gets new 4.0 firmware, the ESRB makes plans to stop early game announcements, and we celebrate six years of Orange Lounge Radio being on the air
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there once again and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio for the 284th time in a row if you've been a long time listener
My name is Rob Roberts joining you for the next three hours to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
Joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
Hi
How are you?
I'm here
Yeah?
Nah, it's all good
Yeah, it's all good?
Yeah
It's all good at Camp Jamie
I'm recovering from my milkshake
Did your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?
It brought something
Alright
It brought gas
Say hello to as well TechMaster
You're so gross
Say hello as well to TechMaster Loki
How would a milkshake bring you gas?
I don't know, it's just the first thing my toilet brain went to
Alright, I too finished the milkshake
Did you?
I went and got my, cause I went and stopped by Burger King and I got a large milkshake and a large soda
And what did it bring you?
Uh, cooling
Cooling?
Alright
Yeah, cause I'm not so hot anymore
Alright, sounds good
Are you seriously freaking cold?
I mean
I just, I need like something to cover up while I'm under all of this
Let me introduce, since Loki's already yelling at somebody, he has not been on our show in quite some time
About a year
But he's, well a year is quite some time
I was just quantifying it
Alright
But Miklotov is here tonight
Hello
And Miklotov ran away from our program to go be in Kansas for a little while, right?
Yeah
Alright
And he walked into the studio tonight wearing a blanket
Cause it feels cozy after you eat a lot of food, it's like oh I'm just gonna relax
I would like to point out it's over a hundred degrees outside here in lovely Sacramento, California
It feels, this is like a nice blanket, it's not heavy so it feels fine
But I'm just saying it's like a, it's a hundred degrees outside
Hold on
And we had to have the lights off before the show to keep it cool in here
We have like two fans going, the door open to the house
Yeah, we might return the lights off, screw Justin TV, it's not a, it's not a video show
And
And I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a shirt underneath
And shorts
And now a blanket
And a blanket
And why, just because
Because it feels nice
Because it's, yeah if you eat a lot of food and then you're like oh I'm so stuffed and
you don't want to move
It always feels better to just have something that you kind of wrap yourself up in
Like you were the food and this is your shell, like a tostada or something
Okay, uh, tell us what you've been up to for the past year, anything exciting?
Hmm, no
Okay
I almost got hit by a tornado
That's, I think that's kind of cool
That's what happens in Kansas, huh?
Yeah, it interrupted wow and it wasn't very fun because I had to stop playing wow for
a minute
Gotcha
And go check on the tornado
Are you still in touch, you used to work at the Konami building but then they don't have
their offices here in NorCal
Yeah
I don't know what you can or can't say about the past or the future
Oh, I'm working for them as an independent contractor
Ah, very cool
Can you talk about anything, probably not, huh?
Stuff
No, it's whatever I always do
Alright
You doing stuff?
As arrows
Alright
Hey, those lights went off
Alright, let's change the topic and talk about our gaming weeks
We always like to start the show off talking about what we've been playing in our weeks
and we'll start it off ladies first, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
Um, I played Ragnarok and Pinball, as usual
And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm still waiting for Dan to bring me back, the world ends with you
so I have no idea what's going on
That's it
Alrighty, Loki
Um, I got an R4 this week so I was playing some DS games
and I tried playing, um, what was it, uh, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan
but that game is boring, absolutely boring since it's all in Japanese and I can't read any of it
I'm like, seriously, when am I gonna get to the boob poking, okay?
But, uh, yeah, just, it's, uh, One Trick Pony it seems like
Um, and then, uh, I tried a bit of, um, Band Brothers
which is actually pretty, pretty neat
Um, a little difficult to figure out how to play it though
but, um, still a pretty cool music game, it'd be nice to see that brought over here
Um, then also played, um, Jump Ultra Superstars
which, um, I guess people compare it to Smash Brothers a little bit
I wouldn't say it's quite like Smash Brothers
There's a lot of characters in it for sure and I like how you can, um,
kind of combine different pieces of artwork and stuff to, you know, allow you to switch characters
and add abilities and stuff like that
So I'd say it's more like Marvel vs. Capcom or something like that
which is pretty cool
And then, um, played a little bit of that Still Live game
I mean, it's pretty much very similar to the, uh, Flash Portal games
so if you've played that you, you know, pretty much have played this game as well
And, um, Point Blank DS because I was trying to find that everywhere
and no one sold it and just kind of gave up on it
I mean, Point Blank DS is pretty much, you know, just like Point Blank without a gun
and just using the stylus and actually pretty fun
So, uh, too bad that that didn't do very well
And then of course on top of all that stuff I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV
Because that's fun
So, what does this device do, this R4, for those that don't know?
It allows you to run homebrew on your DS and also you can, you know, run ROMs as well
for DS games
Basically it uses a micro SD card and you can throw stuff on there
It's good for, like, playing import stuff, you know, especially if you're just looking to try out a game
and don't actually plan on buying it
What the hell is this?
Aw, I was waiting for the singing to start
Yo ho yo ho, a pirate's life for me, bad joke
You need to queue up your jokes next time
Terrible, I know
Aw, that one would have been better
I'm glad to know after six years things still don't work right on this program
Awesome
And then other, well, I was working on some other things
I posted a video on Game Trail, because I mean the post-it on the YouTube community we have
But I forgot how to, so
Well, it was like the easiest thing in the world
It is the easiest thing in the world, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, okay
So tell us a little bit, because this is kind of exciting
Because Orange Launch Radio hasn't done anything video related
I mean, we don't really count just in TV
I mean, no offense to just the TV people
But this is just a camera pointed at people doing a radio show
It's really not that exciting, but you wanted it, so hey
But this is the first real video thing we've done in a long time
So tell us a little more about what you did
I actually finally got my video set up working at home
Because I've been trying forever to get my damn capture card to work
And be able to play something at the same time
It actually involved me bringing back the old TV that was in the arcade cabinet
Back from work, and putting it on the floor next to my computer
And actually running it from the game system to the TV
And then the TV to the capture card
And it actually works perfect that way
So I captured a bunch of footage
I've been playing around with this glitch in Grand Theft Auto 4
With an evil swing set
And I put it all to the music of Weapon of Choice
Edited it together, and it's kind of funny
And I know when he describes it, it doesn't sound that exciting
But I actually watched a video, and I'm not even that big a Grand Theft Auto person
I know it's a good game and all, but I just don't get into those types of games as much as everyone else
I kind of laughed, it was really funny, it was well done
It fit the music so well
I tried, I spent long hours trying to get it to go with the music
Making video is a bitch
I've done video for an online game that Shane and I are involved with
And it's a pain in the ass
It took me all night to do a two and a half minute video
Yeah, it's a three minute video, and I started with like four hours of video
And I cut it down to three minutes
I bet the wife loves it
Oh yeah, she loves the fact that I'm sitting there doing all that stuff
Yeah, absolutely loves it
No, and then after I finished that, then I started working on something else
Which I was hoping to have done today, but it's not
So you'll have to wait
Can you give us any hints?
Maybe
I'll say something
Something that people have been asking for for a long, long time
Loki is making happen
Yeah
We'll say that
Alright
So so much for your gaming week, is that it?
Yeah
Why is the Unabomber at our window?
It looks like it's Andrew, not the Unabomber
I know it's Andrew
I'll go next, I didn't even know he was coming
I'll go next and talk about my gaming week
Oh my god, it's the Unabomber
Hi, how are you?
Get him on a mic somehow
Oh, the fourth mic's not hooked up now
I didn't know you were coming, that's alright
I wouldn't miss it for the world
Yeah, this is the kind of gems that Justin-
See, Justin TV? He does kind of look like the Unabomber
Alright
What's on your mind?
Andrew, welcome to the show tonight
Oh, not much
You gotta get that mic like right there
It's now working right
It's a crazy mic
You're here to celebrate our sixth birthday with us, I'm sure
Of course
And your own anniversary is tomorrow, as in your birthday
Yeah
How old are you going to be tomorrow?
Appropriately, I'm going to be 23
Wow, ah, oh my gosh, there's that number of coincidence again
That got brought up on Bobby's show earlier
Oops
Wow
That means you were 17 when this show started?
Yes, I was
God, I'm old
God, I am old, alright
Let's talk about My Gaming Week
We'll get back to Andrew later, you can talk about his
My Gaming Week, I played Warcraft because I'm addicted
And some other stuff too
I got into very randomly
Like, got back into playing Guitar Hero 3
I don't even remember why, but I just started, like, hacking at it again
And some of those songs that were really holding me back
Like, Knights of Sedonia was a song on hard
I was having a hard time beating
Yeah, I'm still on the hard difficulty, I can't play expert yet
Because there's these triplets in hard mode that are so difficult in that song
I had the hardest time getting past it, but finally I beat it this week
And then I started playing some other songs too
And I even downloaded the Coldplay pack and the No Doubt pack
Because, I don't know, for some reason
I enjoy playing Guitar Hero more than I enjoy playing Rock Band
Which I know is weird
Because you would think, like, Rock Band's kind of the better game
And in a lot of ways it is
But since I don't really like to play drums
And I'm not going to sing in my house
Like, especially when nobody's around
It's kind of like a party where I can use alcohol as an excuse
It's, I don't know, there's nothing to play but guitar
And I kind of like the guitar parts in Guitar Hero
Better than I do Rock Band
Rock Band gets kind of boring
Because, I don't know, it's a little closer to the real thing or something
I don't know
But Guitar Hero gets all crazy and I like that
So, Rapid Slasher and Chat Room
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com agrees
That section on Sedonia is tough
It is tough
There it is
Cheeseburger in Chat says
Hey Rob, I was 7 when the show started
Because he's 13 now, my god
I'm old
I thought he was listening to the show at 7
I don't think he was actually listening when he was 7
I think he just said he was
Happened to be 7
Joshie16 in Chat says
Guitar Hero is more fun alone
Yeah, I kind of agree
Guitar Hero may not be the better party game
But it's more fun to play by yourself
So, go figure
Alright, also in my gaming week
I bought Space Invaders Extreme for the PSP
Because I had played a little bit
When Loki had it over here
I don't know, whatever
He had it on his PSP a while ago
And I played it and I kind of liked it
I was like, hey, it's like Space Invaders mixed with Rez
And it was kind of cool
So I decided I was going to get it
Although, I don't know, it's not really like mixed with Rez
It just has that same like, upbeat music
And it kind of feels like a game that would have been made by Q Entertainment
But it's not
My only kind of complaint about the game
I mean, they made Space Invaders a heck of a lot of fun
I mean, not only do you have
You know Space Invaders
Who doesn't know that game by now
But now
Like, not only is it flashy with the graphics in the background
But the invaders come in little colors
And you have some red ones
Some green ones
And some blue ones
And if you shoot four blue ones in a row
You get one type of weapon
You shoot red ones in a row
You get another
And so on
So that's kind of like a challenge-y element to it
If you want the good weapon
So it's like a cross between Space Invaders
And Raven
Yeah, I guess, yeah
It's kind of different
But the only thing that kind of disappointed me
Now granted, I haven't played the game a whole lot
Or gotten very far
So it's probably not fair for me to say a whole lot about it right now
But, I mean, I've played far enough where I've started to notice this
I don't notice a lot really change from level to level
I mean, yeah, the aliens get smarter
You start to fight these, like, massive aliens
And one of the coolest things, I think, in the game is the bosses
Like, they actually have boss aliens they have to fight
Which is kind of cool
And, you know, then you have the little miniature aliens
But it's still always blue, red, green aliens
And the same weapon upgrades that you had in level one
So I was just kind of hoping maybe some of that would change and upgrade as the game goes on
If it does, I haven't gotten there yet
And I've gotten to the point where it's starting to feel a little stale
So, you know
You know, because the original Space Invaders was all white or green aliens
It's been 30 fucking years since the original Space Invaders
It ain't broke
Well, but would you spend $20 to buy the original Space Invaders
Which I think most of us now play as, you know
Oh, we downloaded the ROM in two seconds to play on MAME
And we fire it up one time and go
Oh, yeah, this game, oh, this is fun
Ah, next game
Pretty much
How many people actually sit there and play old school Space Invaders for, like, three hours
Like they did back in the 80s
Um
Really?
Really?
When?
About two years ago
Wow
Why?
Were you trying to, like, break it?
You know, okay
I take a little bit of it back because
I've even found myself on GameTap going back to old Atari 2600 games
That were boring years ago, like Kaboom
And I frickin' played Kaboom for, like, an hour and a half
Just a couple weeks ago
So I could, I guess I could see that
I was trying to break my old record, though
But let's face it
We used to be really, really good at Space Invaders
Let's face it, we're a little weird
You should watch King Kong, watch the guy play Crystal Castles with his feet
I guess that's true
Do you have any interest, then I want to ask you
Do you have any interest in newer Space Invaders?
Or is it like, oh no, this is bastardizing a classic?
I would try it
Alright
I mean, I'm open to anything
The new Frogger made me want to throw up
But I'll give Space Invaders a try
The one on Xbox Live?
No
That Frogger 2?
Oh
No, no, the old new Frogger
The old new Frogger
Oh, okay
Wanna be 3D Frogger?
It made me want to throw up
I downloaded Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, by the way
The, um
The, uh, revamped version
Um
I don't think it was based on PlayStation 2
I think it's original
Or a PlayStation game
I think it's an original game
Um
It's
There was a Frogger 2, though
It's so cute
You want to throw up in your mouth
But the little hoppy noise gets really irritating
But I only played the demo
I didn't actually buy the full game
So
Anyway, that's pretty much it for my gaming week
Space Invaders
Which is pretty cool
I mean, for 20 bucks
It's pretty hard to beat
It's a good priced game
And, uh
It's a
You know, PSP games are not games you'd usually
I mean, unless you're playing Crisis Core or something
Not something you spend hours and hours and hours doing
I prefer playing the PSP
While I'm waiting at the airport for my plane
Or while I'm waiting for something, you know, better to happen in my real life
So Space Invaders is a good short attention span game
I tried playing Crisis Core
That game bores me
Really?
Yeah
With all the praise and things it's gotten?
It's boring
I don't know
I tried playing it twice
Now, I've
I played it for a good long
You know, two hour session
Was it, uh, a while ago
When it first came out
And then I played it
Some more
Like the end of April
During the plane flight
And
I just couldn't get into it
It was so boring
It's just because I think you
Kind of start off at that, like, hub there
And you have little places that you can explore
But it doesn't really feel like an actual fancy game
It just feels like
Do mission
Fight people
Go back to the hub
Do mission
Fight people
Go back
I don't know
It's just very boring for me
Okay, I gotta go to chatroom
Because they're talking about
A lot about Space Invaders here
Um, GS68 says from Wikipedia
Space Invaders was a very popular video game
That influenced the video game industry
In Japan, specialty arcades opened with
Nothing but Space Invaders cabinets
The game is considered one of the most
Successful arcade shooting games
Uh, you know, so
We all know that
People went crazy about the game in Japan
We know that
Um, it was much bigger over there
Than it was over here
And the Kitsune in chat says
You see Space Invaders everywhere here
They even have Space Invaders plushies in the arcade
That you can win
That might be kind of cute actually
I had Space Invader
Um, cell phone charm
For a while
Now the original Space Invaders
Can be kind of boring
Continues Kitsune in our chatroom
But I played a newer version
I loved it
And yeah, I, I, I enjoyed
Space Invaders Extreme
Which is a tiny bit stale
But that's okay, it's a good
Short attention span game
Kind of like the Gradius collection
I don't sit there and play Gradius
For hours and hours either
Shooters in general
No comment
Huh?
No comment
Shooters in general to me
Are short attention span games
That's just the way I play
I would like a new Gradius game
That was actually really kickass
You know, cause I mean
Gradius 5 was alright
It was pretty cool
But something really like
Oomph, like awesome
You need a, somehow like
The universe needs to collide
A certain way
And Itagaki needs to do
Gradius 6, right?
There wouldn't be a ship
It'd just be him there
Just like
Kicking people over and stuff
Alright
Putting out cigarettes
On like other ships or something
Let me go over to Miklotov
Who's reading a book
During our show
I guess we're that exciting
Miklotov, do you have anything
You want to say about
Your gaming week
Not our gaming week
But yours
My book is good
I don't know what you're talking about
First of all
Secondly, all I do is play WoW
Or I play DJ Max on my PSP
So
You need to play DS games
I have a DS with a bunch of games on it
Including imports
You will play
I play Oh And On 2
And Phoenix Wright games
And that's about it
And Professor Layton
Well I have Oh And On 2 on here
I have that with me
But it's not my book
And Band Brothers
I have Band Brothers
Band Brothers is a fun game
Tell our listeners about DJ Max
And some of the things you enjoy about it
It's better than Beatmania
We have some listeners that really love it
It's way better than Beatmania
Why
Because it's fun
And it's not insanely stupid sometimes
Unlike Beatmania
Which is insanely stupid most of the time
And it's easy to pick up and go
And the songs are better
And it's Korean
So it's better because of that
So in other words
If you can't sense
Mikolatov's insane bias
For Korean based music
And Korean things
Because he likes Pump It Up a lot too
Yeah Pump It Up is better than DDR
Yeah see if you can't sense his extreme bias
For all things Korean
Then take what he says with the Korean stuff
How about Tycho No Tatrogen DS
I've not played that
It didn't look good
I don't like the one in the arcade
And I didn't like the one on the Playstation
So I don't think I like the one on the DS
But yeah DJ Max is cool
Because you can customize like
Everything in it
And it's fun
It's got stupid videos
Yeah I like the one video with the Power Rangers
Smashing the girls' flowers
The MB Rangers are cool
Is that what it was called?
The MB Rangers?
Yeah
Funny
That's it
Back to book
I like Burning Rangers
Andrew how was your gaming week?
Well I could talk about other games
That are good for 20 bucks
Like Hellgate London
Which looks like it's finally out of beta
What six months after release
They're working on a 2.0 patch
It's an okay Diablo 2 clone
But it could be better
It could be way way better
Other than that I've been enjoying the free weekend
Of Team Fortress 2
And getting in a little day of defeat
Not much else really
Recently got Brawl and unlocked everything
Within nine hours of opening the box
Wow that's dedication
Still haven't got all the achievements though
Still a lot of stuff to do
People need to register me
For Brawl by the way
It's getting a lot of-
Do you know your friend code off the top of your head?
Off the top of my head? No
Thank you Nintendo
I'm not that dedicated
Just go to the forums
I'm there
Look at it
Nice plug
Over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
Click on the forums
Thank you
Anything else you've been playing this week?
Oh that's about it
Besides Brawl and Hellgate
Nothing else
DJ Ratchet in chat says
And again if you want to join our chat room
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
He says
I hope there will eventually be an Elite Beat Agents 2
As much as it pains me to say at fat chance
And Miklotov's agreeing
Why are you agreeing Miklotov?
Cause like
I think
Four people bought it?
I bought it, you bought it
Who else bought Elite Beat Agents?
That's it, no
That's two, there's half
Okay, Andrew bought
There's the four right there
Obviously it was more than four people that bought it
But the sad thing is you know like you go to Fry's
Which is a big electronics store here in California
There were tons and tons of them sitting in the discount bin
I think Nintendo just had higher hopes for the game
It just got so discounted so quick
Because like people saw the music list and were like
Oh it's crappy
Well yeah the music normally would be crappy
But inside the game it was really good
September with the cutscenes made you feel epic
September that was the
That was the one about
And she makes the best hamburgers too
I love that one
That's a really good one
See and people just didn't give enough of a chance
It's not J-pop so why would they care
Elite Beat Agents
I can discount Elite Beat Agents on account of one song
And one song only
And that would be Canned Heat
It was a bad cover
But the story was hilarious
It was a bad cover of a good song with a great story
But it was offbeat
It was not so badly offbeat
Oh good job, good research Katamari's Forever
Says the actual number of copies sold
16,000 per VG charts
Wow
That's practically 4
I mean when you consider that there's a lot of crappy games
That sell way more than that
It's kind of sad
Yeah but 16,000 that's not much bigger than 4
It's really not
Not in the scope of things
Not for a video game
It's 4 times 4,000
Yeah I was close
I had one number right
Alright
Plus Elite Beat Agents can kind of make you cry
You know because it has the sad stage
There's always the sad stage
Which one had the chris
There was the Christmas one
You're the Inspiration
That's the one for that game
All the sad stages are sad except for Oh and Don 1
That one wasn't so sad
But DJ Ratchet's right
You're the Inspiration had some hilarious screw up scenes
It really does
Yes
Like when you see the dad in like a speedo
That cracked me up
The only thing that was more epic than say September in Oh and Don
Would be doing Ready Steady Go saving the world from a giant meteor
That was so epic it was hilarious
I like Oh and Don 2's epic stage
It was cooler
I don't even remember what happens
But I just remember I liked the song better
And it was more fun to play
By the way spoilers for a music game
That's alright
I was just realizing is it really 16,000 or is it 160,000
It can't be 16,000
There's no way
Let me look hold on
It has to be 160
I'm going to look
America
I'll find the answer
While we get into other stuff throughout the show
If it is 16,000
Yeah there's a reason right there
Why we'll never get one
Cause I'm thinking like
God I have Judgement sold more than that game
That's sad
Alright
Housekeeping tonight
Tonight is our sixth anniversary show
Yay

Especially for our long time listeners
Who remember our roots
For now though
Gaming news throughout the gaming world
We'll start it off with Loki
Yes, this week we had a brand new firmware update
For the PSP
And it didn't really add a whole lot
Except for the ability to search on Google
Straight from the cross media bar
And also the other thing that they added along with that
Was now that you can change the viewing speed
During video playback
By pressing the up and down buttons
While you're watching a video
Yay
And I'm sure they also tried to fix some other holes
That were opened up
Allowing people to run homebrew and stuff
And I know that they're already working on custom firmware 4.0
So
Yeah
That doesn't work
Why is it that they're calling it 4.0?
Probably because they had so many updates
That were getting close to 4.0 anyways
It's like 3.96 and stuff
Might as well just go 4.0
Because I guess they would consider the internet search function
As a brand new feature or something like that
Instead of just a little update
So
I don't know, I think they're just running out of numbers
Okay
Going back to Elite Beat Agents for a minute
Because this news about the 4.0 firmware kind of bores me
Because they really didn't do much to call this 4.0
I was expecting something a little more landmark
Going back to Elite Beat Agents
It actually sold.17 million
Which would be 170,000 copies
Not 16,000
That must have been just in the first week or something
Yay, that's still not enough to get another game
And that's also still not as much as
Eye of Judgment, right?
But that is only released though in two regions though
So you have to also count
Whatever
Owen Dunn
Eye of Judgment has sold.21 million copies
Granted, that's worldwide
It didn't sell better than Crysis
Let's see
Comparing it to some other games
Let's see, Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses
Oh, we don't have sales data for that
Let's see, what are some of these other ones?
Maybe I can find
Ah, there we go
Barbie Island Princess on the DS
.14 million copies
That's only 30,000 less than Owen Dunn
How about Elite Beat Agents?
Let's Ride Friends Forever
Let's Ride Friends Forever
Let's Ride Friends Forever
Not in the database
Awesome, it's so crappy it's not even there
What about Imagine Babies?
Oh wait, I found Let's Ride Friends Forever
Imagine Babies? You'd be surprised
It's actually in the top selling
DS titles
I honestly don't understand
Wow, wow, wow, get this
Do you know how many copies of Let's Ride Friends Forever
sold in its first week of release?
No
986
Ok, I'm sorry
So yeah, you're about
What is it?
200 or
211,000
copies now of Eye Judgment
Ok, wow
Wow
Ok, thank god
I'm sorry
Elite Beat Agents
170,000 copies, right?
Imagine Babies, you ready for this?
1.85 million copies
have sold
That's per VGCharts.com
That makes sense though
It's seriously, it's weird
People buy it for their little girls
Cause they want them to know how to raise their babies
It's absolutely weird, that game right there
is like, seriously up in the top
of the DS charts and also
Imagine Fashion Designer is up there too
Ok, iVal
Since I own the game thanks to somebody
in this room
I'm going to play Imagine Babies
this week
Come back and report on it
You better be good on it
Also, Breaking a Million copies sold
Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Happy Cooking
How many did Cookie Mama sell?
Last one
Cookie Mama
Elite Beat Agents sold 170,000
Cookie Mama sold 2.74 million copies
What about Cookie Mama 2? Cause I don't think that did as well
Cookie Mama 2
1.19 million, keep in mind these are worldwide numbers
Crazy
Alright, I'm done
Thank god I wasn't like
Imagine Babies, no one will buy that
Let's just add that to the thing
Yeah, see, I'm smart
You are very smart
It's a good thing you didn't take that as part of the bet
Alright, let's see
Sony planning a clamp down on PSP
Pirating
That's right, there is a piracy problem
on the PSP
said Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe
President David Reeves
And we know about it
We know how it's done
So basically they know how to
log on to any of the many blogs out there
that specifically talk about PSP hacking
Right, they're gonna really clamp down on PSP piracy
These were quotes from
Sony's Devastation
Developer Conference
that was held in London
And it's not all bad news
because
sometimes piracy, says
David Reeves,
fuels the growth of hardware sales
So people
buy PSP, and you know what, I actually kind of see that
because a lot of people bought the PSP
when they found out that they were able to
play NES games on them
It's kind of true
I know a lot of people that when they first got them, that's all they did
They had me put emulators on there for them
and they played NES games
One of my friends went right out and bought one and then modded his battery
Here's one thing to
note though, the whole reason why I'm bringing this up
He went on to say that
there are plans going on
that will crack down on the numbers
of pirates out there, but
There is nothing they can do, absolutely
nothing, they have said this forever
and they have tried different methods
and it's slowed people down
but then eventually they come back around
and they find a new way about it
You have no chance, make your time
It's just like
we're gonna get to another story about another system later
and the same damn thing is going on there
It's ridiculous
People, I wish they would learn
there is nothing they can do
because as soon as they make
more of a bigger deal about it
that's when people start finding out about it
and then they start, oh hey I can do that now
I didn't know
When was the last time that you heard about
hacking being done on the Playstation 3?
I've heard of them
actually trying things
but they still haven't gotten anything to work yet
If I'm not mistaken, Playstation 3 has a more
don't give a shit attitude towards like
installing Linux on it and all that stuff
That's why people don't care
People are looking
to find ways to run homebrew stuff
on it, I think mainly
they're trying to find ways to pirate stuff
but even stuff, even let's just say
you were able to pirate games on the PS3
it's not really
as easy because
if you dump a Playstation 3 game
that's upwards to 50 gigs
you're only going to be able to
throw one or two on your hard drive
at a time
it's just more cumbersome
just say forget it
and they'll do it on the 360 instead
Before we get to our next story
a comment from chat, Amaze Satsuma in chat
says there is one way to stop pirates
send ninjas out to kill them
There you have it
But you know what though
there are ninjas that are
you know, acting in
they're participating in
piracy actually, there's the Wii Ninja
which is a mod chip
for the Wii that allows you to play pirated games
Sairan
in chat says what is a pirate
a miserable little pile of hacks
but enough talk
have at you
please save us from this
nonsense in our chat room
while we get to another story
Rob, you killed it
Hey, I didn't say it, Sairan said it
Do I gotta?
Well, some news about the MMO that
BioWare is
squirting out
they said that it's supposed to be out
between April 2010 and
April 2011
um
well
the article actually said
that EA was funding an MMO
but EA owns BioWare
and it's in Austin
so that's where they got the information from
and um
there's no more uh
information exactly about what it's gonna be
but the theory is Knights of the Old Republic
so
hmm
possible
hmm, that could be interesting
hmm, you say
anyways
there's gonna be some pretty interesting
stuff coming out about Resistance 2
of course just recently they had some gameplay
videos that were premiering on
GameTrailersTV and
now GamePro has
the scoop on some more stuff including
they're gonna be giving out
in random issues of GamePro
free Resistance 2 beta codes
so you'll be able to get in on
the beta for that and they're hoping to sell
a few more magazines with that as well cause
I don't know about you but I don't think GamePro's
doing that great right now. And there's some people
out there that would buy like 10 copies to get a
golden ticket quote unquote right? Yeah pretty
much. Did they say about how many of the magazines
are gonna have this? Nope.
Interesting. But they were saying that
there's tons of juicy
stuff in there and they're saying
it's bigger than Halo
bigger than Call of Duty
I'm sorry though or you know
better than Halo they said
a lot of things are better than Halo
unfortunately
but Resistance 2
is gonna be awesome. Resistance 1 was
absolutely cool. If you loved
Call of Duty and you want more of a
sci-fi game this is perfect
for you.
Of course and I don't think it made tonight's show
roll but I want to say something I read something about
Call of Duty 6 is supposed to be like sci-fi
related. Is that a response
to this? No I would think
they're just getting
they're trying to mix it up a bit but
you know I don't know if that
worked really well for Battlefield
2142 either though because
they tried to mix it up a bit and go a little sci-fi
and futuristic you know
Tom Clancy's been doing that or
the Tom Clancy series I guess
you know with Hawks and
End War and that kind of stuff but
you know I honestly
think that Resistance 2 is gonna be awesome. Resistance
I absolutely out of the first person shooters I've played
Gears of War, Halo 3
just
a lot of them out there
Resistance was my favorite
absolutely which is weird because you know
usually I'm not too favorable on
stuff for the Playstation 3
but you know it honestly is a good game
and I'm definitely buying the next one
Alright
I'm just kinda reading
some other crazy stuff in chat
DJ Ratchet speculates
it ends up only 5 game pros have it
so it actually does turn into
Willy Wonka. Well they're assuming that's gonna be over
60 since they're
obviously gonna be stress testing
servers so you know
there's gonna be 60 player online with
Resistance 2. Will there be more
Resistance 2 beta keys than
copies of Elite Beat Agents sold?
I don't think so.
Alright I promise no more
sales figures but I lied
cause this is actually something a little more current
Metal Gear Solid 4 should be noted
that Fumitsu Magazine has
reported that over in Japan
since Fumitsu Magazine is in Japan
476,334
copies were sold
in the first week
and
by the way 77,208
consoles
were sold that week and that is
like if you kinda do the math there that's
what about like 1 in 4
no 1 in 5?
so like 1 out of every 5
copies of the game sold also
pushed a console. That's pretty
big. There you have it
over in the UK
cause 1 out of every 5
copies was probably one of those
consoles that included the
game with it possibly
over in the UK it should be noted that
Metal Gear Solid 4 well it sold well it did not
do quite as well as Grand Theft Auto
4. It was 14,000
copies short
of the Metal Gear Solid 2 release
in 2002
See I have a bad feeling
that they're gonna start really
budging their numbers with
oh yeah look how many consoles this
game pushed. Well yeah because
you're including it with all the consoles. Of course
it's gonna be
kind of equal with
the console sales. You know
what though? We even know people that have
went out and bought a Playstation 3 just for this
game. Yeah I could believe it.
I mean it's an awesome game.
But then again when Final Fantasy 13 comes out
I will probably buy a Playstation 3 just
for that game so what can you do? Well don't worry
about that time you know the Playstation 4
will be coming out so. Hurray!
Plus maybe Sony
Home I'll actually have to play as well
Yeah I'm sure it'll eventually be
out in beta form of course.
Well
for other news if
anyone's been interested
in LittleBigPlanet
the Sony experience is coming
by on a bunch of trucks
that has different kiosks
with games in it such as
Turismo 5 Prologue, Metal Gear Solid 4
and PSP games
and it's traveling all over
the country so if you go to
us.playstation.com
you can find links to
tour dates there. Do you happen to have the dates
in front of you by chance? I was just wondering if there's
anything local where you can go crash. There's
very few tour dates.
That's alright.
So not a big tour right now. No it's like
each truck's doing like four different
cities and that's it. Huh.
Actually I have
three locations according to this one.
And that's just Baltimore
and Milwaukee. But maybe
more to come. Maybe.
Cause when that Rock Band tour
started didn't they only have a few dates and then
finally it like exploded into like all
these places before the game came out. Okay here we go.
Oh yes. The
PlayStation Patrol tour
is going to Davenport
Iowa, Huntsville Alabama.
I should go visit my family. No.
Trevor City Michigan and
New York City.
Why they gotta hate the West Coast?
Not a single
West Coast date in there.
But the New York City date is July 11th
through July 15th so if any of our listeners
get the urge go check it out
for us. Yeah and please go ask them why they hate
us so much on the West Coast. Oh.
They were probably
already here and I didn't even care.
They've
been here before. They usually come to our
local sunrise fall every now and then.
But you know we had the signing of the
Metreon right? Yes that's true.
I didn't see no
little big planet there.
I just saw you know. Who cares about Metal Gear Solid?
It's all about little big planets.
I'm no longer falling.
Alright go
follow the tour bus or something
and if you happen to go you know
take a camera or something and tell us about
your experience. Anyways there was a whole
bunch of drama last week with
Itagaki leaving Tecmo
and Team Ninja behind.
I am surprised he did not tip over
everything on his way out.
If he has we probably just
haven't heard it yet. Exactly he probably
just you know threw a manager through a window
and then jumped down you know.
While setting the building on fire and
it just blew up behind him in like an elaborate
explosion. See that's the thing
is you know he does it in style.
Everything. Everything he does.
Anyways
so they have
served a gag
order for him to
basically not disclose or
leak any Tecmo trade
secrets and you know
make any false or misleading statements
etc. etc. The only problem is though
it hasn't been signed off by the court yet so he's
talking now.
Yeah so Itagaki put out a press statement
of his own that says you don't tell me to shut the fuck
up.
I come back and kill you again.
I do what I want.
Now his his his press
statement when it was faxed out it was
just a big middle finger.
And then it burst into fire.
Because he's that awesome.
He's such a rock star.
I bet it was on paper that's
flammable as soon as it opened.
Have we had the
burning finger. Have we had the concept
on this show before to have a
game where you just you are Itagaki.
I mean this would be a great
now like like before it's like where what
could the game be like you know oh you're
just you're Itagaki you sleep with chicks you burn
hotel rooms down understand now
now we have a purpose because he got kicked
out of Tecmo now you got now you have
good motives yes and
motive well there could definitely be a game here.
We're going to elevate him to a
Chuck Norris status you know he's going to
be immortal at some point.
He is the Chuck Norris of game designers really.
Anyways
Itagaki. He laughs at Chuck Norris.
Yes.
He doesn't have to do anything better than Chuck
Norris because you think Chuck Norris is fucking funny.
Of course Tecmo
the man denies that
Team Ninja is actually leaving them
and also
kind of denying different aspects about the lawsuit.
One of the things that they say
was inaccurate was that all of the
employees were suing
Tecmo. Well
yes and no it's actually two employees suing
Tecmo on behalf of
all the other employees so
I'd like some sort of convoluted class
action. Yeah there's a whole lot of weird
stuff going on there. Japanese law is
kind of funny anyway. Not paying overtime
and that kind of thing you know.
I don't know.
Is this why you know
Tecmo Bowl is just
taking forever to come out. Team Ninja doesn't do
Tecmo Bowl. I understand. Team Ninja should
do Tecmo Bowl.
Ninja Bowl
that'll be fun.
Rob do you remember Battle Chess?
Oh yeah hell yeah. Where they would like
kill each other and everything. That was awesome.
They should have like battle football.
All right.
Well listen this is what
Itagaki's new job is going to be
okay.
Basically if you imagine
you know like a kitchen
stadium except it's not
a kitchen stadium it's just a
stadium with Itagaki being
the chairman and he has people fight each
other to the death with a secret weapon
that is revealed on each show.
I like it.
So Itagaki should not be so worried
about this divorce from Tecmo because he will be
a rock star elsewhere. Oh yeah they'll pick him up
that Microsoft will probably have him work
for him.
Nice.
Meanwhile in another part of the galaxy
Sony is
they're kind of fiddling
with this whole idea of getting into the
gaming phone.
You know especially because
Apple you know you heard them at the
conference a couple weeks ago they announced
you know that the iPhone is expanding into more
and more gaming outlets when they showed the
pictures of Monkey Ball and all this stuff.
It looks like
Sony might be getting into gaming a little more
themselves. It's Sony Ericsson
F30
or 05 the F305
is this new model of Sony Ericsson
it kind of sort of like
has this giant screen on it that's iPhone
ish. But here's the thing that's interesting
about it. There's a up down
left right little control maneuver. Okay
well whatever you probably seen those on the phone although that looks
kind of like a game controller. But the buttons
are also labeled X and O just
kind of like you would have on a Playstation
controller. And
the system here little Sony Ericsson
comes with games on it.
Bowling bash fishing
and jockey and it
all of them use an accelerometer
that is actually located inside
the device as well. Why in the hell does
your phone need an accelerometer. I'm not sure
unless like it knows to shut off
if it's falling out of your pocket or something
I don't know. But
it does have one in it.
Or if it senses that you're falling
for a long time it's like you're falling
to your death. Do you wish to call loved ones.
Yes or no.
Oh nice.
It shouldn't
ask you yes or no because all it's going to get is
it's
all it's going to get
because I think if you're falling out of a plane
your death you're not going to have time to say oh
yes. Hey I don't know
are you trying to tell me though that
no wait I mean cake
are
you trying to tell me that crank was
fake. That movie was fake
that he couldn't like fall out of
a helicopter and have time to call his loved
one on the cell phone and then land and
die. It
was fake in the movie but it was real
when it got he did it
said he landed and he's like fuck this
I'm too cool to die and then shot the
plane down. All right.
All
right. Well how
about some completely innocent and happy
news. No
Disney
this makes me kind of
I just think it's funny because I'm going to have to
draw the parallel okay.
Disney is making a
game about a dog
who shoots laser beams
from his eyes and
barks with a sonic boom. Wait a minute
I think I've heard
of this game before.
What. Go ahead continue on.
It's an animated movie.
And his owner is called Penny
who besides me is thinking
Inspector Gadget.
I'm sorry brain is not that cool.
Okay but
it's a girl named Penny who
who hacks. She's a hacker.
This is Inspector Gadget
but with the cooler dog. Little kids are not
hackers. It's like you mix
Inspector Gadget and the dog and
give him John Travolta's voice. Wait I have a
question for the nerdy wait
I have a question for nerdy
heterosexual straight guys in chat
okay insta poll here
heterosexual nerdy straight guys only
did you have a crush on Penny growing up?
That's what I want to know like
was she hot? Or lesbians.
Yeah I guess lesbians were too.
Yeah.
What made her hot?
I had my issues as a kid.
She was the only smart one in the whole damn place.
Alright sorry go ahead.
We've turned your innocent
Disney dog thing into
Dude Penny was she
into schoolboy lust?
To continue
the dog's name is
Bolt
and it's basically
him and
Penny traveling the world and taking
care of shit but
it is actually
going to be on everything but the
PSP
and it's going to tie in with
a movie about a famous
dog with super powers
on a television show and gets shipped to New York
by accident so he's trying to get back to Hollywood
and John Travolta is doing his
voice.
And for those people who may be interested
it was I'm not sure if it
still is animated by the same people
that did
or the same artist I should say that did
Lilo and Stitch so
it's pretty cool. Alright let's check out
the results of our instant quick poll
pool brought to you
by our chatroom chat.orangelandradio.com
question was for the heterosexual
man in our chatroom
was Penny hot?
Yes yes hell
yeah yes lol Penny was cool
no no no no
I thought she was awesome I thought brain
was hotter I was too
young what the fuck no yeah
Penny was hot even for a lull
I'll say no I didn't think
she was hot blonde pigtails
pigtails equals handles
Penny was hot
no I was too
busy as a child crushing on
Sasami from Tenchi Muyo
oh wow that definitely
dates you and my favorite
Vicky from Small Wonder greater
than Penny from Inspector Gadget
cause you like a robo chick that can you know
not wear out
alright thank you
chatroom for participating in that
perfect we have we have
scientific research that has to be done
here at Orange Lounge Radio
anyhow so
yeah if you're not into
say cartoon
girls or animated
dogs you may be interested
in more Mortal Kombat
vs. DC Universe news
in fact
there are some more characters confirmed
for the game
including
the
Flash, Robin
Wonder Woman, Green
Lantern, Black Canary
Hawkman and Power
Girl cool
she's got big boobs
sorry
no you know what I'm glad she said that because
I don't really follow comics I have no idea who
Power Girl is like is she a girl dressed up like
a Duracell battery or something I have to
Power Girl is actually Super
Girl from a different universe so she's exactly
the same person as Supergirl that has these humongous
boobs that's like the only difference
Big Breasted Universe I can dig that
I can dig that
anyways they're also saying
that there's
a possible two game deal
and download content
as well she has big
boobies look at that
no look at the picture that Alex Ross
did okay I'm looking at wait now
but hold on on this Justice League
Unlimited that's the stupid cartoon
well she does not have big boobies there
she has weird
her boobs look like a cucumber
stuffed down her shirt and that one
look at Power Girl and Alex
Ross and look at that that's the picture he did
yes
those are
wow I think I saw boobs like that
on the Jerry Springer show once that's about it
alright
gee I have no idea why that character was
picked for the game I mean
Robin I've heard of Wonder Woman I've heard
of pretty much every single one of those other characters
you've named I've heard of Power Girl
I had never heard of but now I understand why
she's in the game
I want the
Joker though I want Harley
I want Harley Quinn
what's up with that
what's up with that what is up with that
alright what's up with this
yeah seriously like if you look at some of these
just do like a
Google image search they've got
one that's like
crap
wow
that's a little over the top
massive approval
Loki had you ever heard
of Power Girl before tonight
nope
but now you'll never forget
no I probably will alright
I'm not a big
I've made no secret of it that I'm not
the world's biggest DC fan
but I've got characters I like
and I like her because she's bitchy
she's fair
and she's got boobs
hitstun says Harley Quinn
was the first character I made in Soul Calibur 3
in the create your own character mode
I think the first character I made
was a totally naked person wearing
a bishop's hat
that did like capoeira dancing
or something it was crazy
alright
anyhow I have no idea
how to segue into this story
so I will just say the ESRB
is sadly going to
probably no longer be
leaking game announcements early
cause you know we find out about all these cool games
cause they show up on the ESRB's website
there was Earthbound coming to the Wii
we found out about that early
Castlevania
the full name of that game
why are you still laughing Loki
so speaking of big boobs
I hear giggling in my right ear
oh it's Andrew
he started off a joke
and I don't know where it's going
is it from the toilet paper book
I was going to say though
yeah it sucks that the ESRB
wait wait I didn't even say why
let me finish the story
now
when these companies submit the games to get the rating
they can actually fill in a date
when the title will be uploaded
on the ESRB's website
if the company for whatever reason doesn't fill it out
though it will automatically
go on the website 30 days after it's rated
so basically companies can now choose
what date the game will go on the website
but the ESRB is saying don't abuse this
which is kind of interesting
in the memo that went out about this
quote the ESRB system will not work for consumers
if publishers arbitrarily
select dates bearing no reasonable
relationships to consumers interest
in the product
but it should be noted this would still have
no effect on some of the other ways that games
have been leaked through official agencies
such as the OFLC in Australia
exactly
now Loki
you had a comment
that's exactly what I was going to say
well that doesn't stop everybody else from doing it
and besides you know
there's a lot of other ways to find out about leaked dates
but you don't know of any of them right?
of course not
alright well you know what
I don't know about you guys but I kind of liked
when the ESRB would leak things early
and now I feel like I'm going to be sitting in the dark
until they want me to know about released dates
and I like ruining Christmas
I like finding out about stuff early
so this ESRB news
kind of makes me a little bit angsty
and when I get angsty we cue the FU music
music
just a massive FU
to the assholes
on the Ragnarok server I play on
who are duplicating items
and selling them and basically
doing a whole bunch of shit that's now
I wouldn't say it's completely ruined everything
but it's made things difficult for other people
so
FU to them
I have two FUs of the week
my first FU goes to me
for spending $10 to go watch The Happening
which was horrible
and not even like so bad it was good
like Showgirls
you know bad
but it was just bad
it was really really bad
my other FU goes to the fact
this is a much bigger FU
my other FU goes to the fact that I had to have not just one
but two MRIs last week
I went in for an MRI
if you've been listening to this show the past three months
I've been having issues with my pancreas
that kept me out a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital
blah blah blah cry me a river
but I was having a follow up appointment to check on my pancreas
on Thursday I had an MRI
and I don't know if you've ever had an MRI done
but if you have to drink this really nasty stuff
before you have an MRI
it's wretched
this barium stuff is wretched
they were probably trying to eliminate your pancreas
well no
it's not so much that
it's horrible but having to leave work early
go to this place or whatever
so I went in on Thursday had it done
they called me at five o'clock at night
oh Rob the thing that your doctor
wanted to see doesn't come out
clear in our MRI thing
because we have an older MRI thing out here in Folsom
we need you to go to our Roseville office
where they have a newer MRI machine
things you could have told me about
the first time
it wasn't written on there what my doctor was looking for
or nothing I mean if you didn't think it was going to come up on the old one
why didn't you just tell me to go to the new place to start with
instead of making me miss two days of work
and have to drink that nasty nasty stuff twice
so
but anyway I'm hoping the MRIs
show that I'm healthy again
because otherwise I'll be filled with more FUs
and nobody wants that
Andrew
first of all FU to GameStop

Pyro, what do you have? All sorts of
Pyros on the servers, nothing else

be a crab fisher I guess
Guitar Hero
Aerosmith that's coming out on
Playstation 2, Xbox 360
PS3 and
the Wii as well as
bundles and all those
and that
would be it
That's a pretty busy week for games
here in America even though there's not a whole lot of
AAA titles
I guess maybe Guitar Hero Aerosmith and Guitar Hero
on tour but not a lot of huge stuff
but pretty busy
Alone in the Dark was pretty awesome
Well you know it's not been
getting great reviews
I heard that it got leaked out already
Yeah there was a little bit of controversy
over that because Atari is
accusing people of
Well you know, fuck them, seriously
They were pissed off that someone was reviewing
the game
prior to being released because
they weren't one of their authorized reviewers
or whatever
and to their offense
they didn't play a pirated version
it's just they got one that someone broke
street on so it's not
necessarily their fault but I
still think it's fucked up that Atari's like
oh we don't want any independent reviews
out there because god forbid it
I would have told them I was going to give it a good
review but fuck you
I don't know, it's annoying
and let's not forget
though, and we do have another story about
this game, but let's not forget that Driver 3
Atari paid off people
to give it good reviews
Just keep that fresh in your mind
Yikes
Rapid Slasher in chat
says if you buy Guitar Hero Aerosmith
you are a tool
My husband's buying it, take it back
I'm thinking of buying it too
My husband's buying it, take it back
You don't want to face the wrath of Jamie
Alright, it is a waste of money in my opinion
but you know, I don't care for
these add-on games that are coming out in the
middle there
I mean, you could put that stuff out as download
content I think the song list
could have been a little better because I saw
the finalized song list today and you know
I just don't understand why they can't do
like say like a $20 download
thing or something like that for
Guitar Hero 3 and just call it
because they did that with was it
Samurai Warriors 2, Empires
or something like that, they were going to
release its own 360 game for that
but they decided, hey, you know what
it's not really that much different, I mean
it's just kind of an add-on, so we're just going to
release this as download content and that's what they did
I don't understand why they just don't do that with this
He took it back
Probably because of the PS2 owners
Damn right he took it back
Yeah, but you can release it on those systems
but just don't release it
Just like the rock band Track Packs
They can release that stuff
standalone or you can do a download
for cheaper
Now Rapid Slasher clarifies the comment and says
it's just that the song list is really weak
and I kind of agree
My husband's favorite band is Aerosmith
He probably won't be too interested in
Guitar Hero Metallica next year
That's for me
Guitar Hero Tool isn't a bad idea though
Yeah, I mean
I like Aerosmith and all
but I'm more of just a fan of Guitar Hero
and I wouldn't mind having a lot of
new songs to play from
I'm not buying any of these games
until Guitar Hero DVDA comes out
I kind of
want a new guitar too, my other one is starting
to break, I've had a guitar hero too
but I need a guitar that's going to be compatible
with rock band, I'm just not interested
Well then you probably don't want a Guitar Hero
guitar
God, so stupid, I hate both of those companies
I really shouldn't
buy any of these games anymore
until they find a way to make it work
Well the 360 though, you do have to remember though
that they are at least compatible with each other
whereas if you had a PS3 you're fucked
Alright
Dark Tetsuya says Guitar Hero Journey
Yes, I would be there first in line, I'd pre-order it
the minute it was announced
Anyhow, getting over to Japanese
release dates, my usual source
of information of Japanese release dates is not working
right now so I have an abbreviated list for you guys
Over in Japan this week
on the Xbox 360, they get Battlefield
Bad Company comes out
on the Playstation 3, The Darkness finally makes its way
to Japan as well as Quake Wars
or Enemy Territory Quake Wars
and on the Nintendo Re
did I say Nintendo Re?
The Re
The Re, the Wii, Ford Racing
Ford Racing Offroad
was what I was starting to say
but somehow combined it all into one word
Lovely
Alright, that's going to do it for release dates
Well, there's other stuff
in case anyone is interested
and I am particularly interested
in this myself
Okay, you know what one of my favorite games ever is?
Custer's Revenge
Hell no, Dragon's Lair
and the 25th anniversary of Dragon's Lair
is coming about and so
the
artistic, I would say
well, the animator
that's behind it, Don Bluth
is
from what I understand
is going to be doing
an autographed
version of the game for
a week that will be on
DVD, PC, Blu-Ray
and it's also going to be designed by
Rick Dyer who was the designer
and two of the other animators
Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy
Hopefully the Blu-Ray version actually
works this time instead of
it being broken
Well, they said the
Blu-Ray version is
supposed to run at 1080p
and play just like the
original coin-op version
and there's supposed to be lobby
posters that are $80 each
Geez
Can we get Space Ace while we're at it?
I know, right? Well, maybe
when the anniversary for Space Ace comes about
How about they just animate a new
Dragon's Lair 3
I would like to get a
Commodore 64 signed copy of the game
I'll tell you what, if you've never seen
Dragon's Lair and the Commodore 64, go check out
some old videos of it on YouTube
Not only was the game insanely hard
I mean, insanely freaking
hard, harder than the actual arcade game
I will say
It was kind of creepy
Like, the music in it was very creepy
Look it up
It's an animated game that's done
just like Dragon's Lair
Who's driving car? Bear's driving car! Left!
I don't know
There could be a clerk's game
somewhere, I'm just not sure that's it
Yeah, but I don't think the market's real open for
in-action games
Wah wah
It said it right in front of me
So
if you're looking for something a little bit more
action-packed, then perhaps
you need a game that comes
with a gun
Yes, actually there is a brand new
Nerf N-Strike game
coming out from EA
That will feature a gun peripheral
for the Wii that's kind of like, you know
something that you strap the remote into
But, when you're not playing
the Wii, you can actually turn it into a real
Nerf gun and fire at people's heads
Like God intended it
It will be
$59.99
And we'll include of course
the gun shell, it's due out November
17th
No word on what it is, but hey
it comes with a gun, so you know, if the game sucks
you can go play outside
It's Nerf the game, what else do you need to know?
Yes, the Nerf game has been
Nerfed, I heard
Alright, anyhow
We're about
done with the first half here of episode
number 284, our 6th anniversary
show, but we could not say goodbye
to part A without taking a moment as we have
for quite a while now here on the program
and paying respect to our elders, and we do that
through a little segment we like to call
The Classic Video Game of the Week, where Jamie's
going to dig through the archives
and pick a game in the dusty
corner of a closet that she thinks
needs a little more respect from you kids
that were only 7 years old when the show
started, and so on, so
Dark Soccer, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?
It's a game that I literally tripped on
this morning in the vault
it had fallen, and I tripped on it
It's SMK Gals Fighter
which was on Neo Geo
Pocket Color in 2000
Play some of that music
Dig that 8-bit music
You know what
there's a
my friend over at the local
plan trade has one of those
and he says he'll sell it to me if
I wanted it
I don't know what I'd do with that
It has a really good version of Bubble Bobble on it
I'm sorry, Puzzle Bobble
I can only play so many versions
of Puzzle Bobble
We used to keep it in our bathroom
It has Neo Geo Card Fighters
on it
Card Fighters Clash was actually pretty cool
but anyway
you've got
basically different SMK female
characters, hence
SMK Gals Fighters
that are playable in the game
It's a 2D, sorta weird mono color
Neo Geo Pocket Color
did not have that great of a color
capability, so
the characters are pretty monotone
and they're all
SD sprites, so it's pretty cute
However
the characters that are in this game
are, you have
Mai, Shiranui
Athena, Yuri
Leona, Shirmi
who I named my cat after
Nakaru, Shiki, Akari
from The Last Blade
Hidden are also Whip from King of Fighters
and Yuki Kushinata
from King of Fighters 97
and your boss is Miss X
which I think is funny
Rob, do you remember
that Margaret Cho sketch
she talked about being raised by drag queens
and one of them was named Miss X
and Miss X is Iori Yagami in drag
Nice
So I thought I would share that
And actually
one of the characters
Yuki
is actually
the one I was mentioning before
is actually Kyo's girlfriend
and it's the only game she's ever fought in
A bunch of the other guys make
cameos, like you have
Kyo, Ryo, Takuma
Seikenso
and
Yashiro, a few other people
so it's pretty cool
and some of the moves were
altered to look funny
so
there you go, Gals Fighter
Alright, your classic
video game of the week, Gals Fighter
here on Orange Lounge Radio
Have I given the Neo Geo Pocket Color
any love yet? I think that is the
first Neo Geo Pocket Color love we've had here
on the program. It was about time
So there you have it
Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in our Part B
and tonight, Listless
returns to Orange Lounge Radio
It's where you guys in chat will have a say
Making the definitive list, and this has been a list
ten years in the making, we are going
to decide tonight the best Bamani song
of the past ten years. We're going back to our roots
a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned for that
in Part B of our show
Until then, see you a little later
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live
on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world
twice a week. Stay tuned
to our podcast feed for the conclusion
of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
