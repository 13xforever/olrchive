0	5620	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5620	11620	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11620	14980	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
14980	19320	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19320	22980	And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio, here on All Games Radio,
22980	27440	where we broadcast live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,
27440	30400	immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show, so sometimes it's a couple minutes early,
30400	33040	sometimes it's a couple minutes late, as it was tonight.
33040	36920	But that's alright, because we have some great shows that we play with here on All Games Radio,
36920	40640	not just Bobby on Sunday nights, but a whole sort of assortment of different podcasts
40640	42480	and other live shows that air throughout the week.
42480	46280	So if you haven't checked it out yet, you definitely should, www.allgames.com.
46280	50400	Meanwhile, we got some other gaming news to get into, and we're gonna get into that in just a minute,
50400	54160	but we gotta follow up with some of that hilarity from the Part A,
54160	57720	or I guess I shouldn't say hilarity, because somebody is gonna get yelled at
57720	61320	over all those game news things getting leaked out.
61320	63760	Loke, you were doing some poking around on the website.
63760	65400	What kind of stuff were you looking at there during the break?
65400	67840	Well, I was just trying to, you know, pull up a bunch of...
67840	69120	What's the name of these guys again?
69120	69960	The Marketing Research...?
69960	71000	Intellisponse.
71000	72120	Okay, Intellisponse.
72120	72880	Intellisponse.
72880	75360	But I thought it was funny, though, because they have...
75360	80840	There was a section on the NeoGAF forum that they were...
80840	86000	Someone had highlighted their privacy policy, and it's all the policy.
86000	89640	Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority.
89640	94680	We have taken careful measures to secure your information.
94680	95320	Whoops.
95320	100840	We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from PC to our servers.
100840	103560	Our secure server software encrypts information,
103560	108560	ensuring that all internet transactions remain private.
108560	110320	That's gotta be so embarrassing, though.
110320	111280	That's gotta be so embarrassing.
111280	112680	So stupid.
112680	113720	Yeah, they have, like...
113720	119160	Yeah, it is secure, and it will prompt for a password and stuff like that.
119160	123200	But if you remove part of the URL on that, it won't...
123200	125200	So...
125200	127400	It's broken.
127400	127960	But...
127960	129800	Yeah, somebody's gonna get screamed out over that.
129800	132120	Lots of stuff, and we'll talk about it a little bit more later on.
132120	134200	I'd be curious to see if this company makes a statement,
134200	135760	or if they just try to pretend it didn't happen.
135760	138080	I think they're just gonna pretend it didn't happen,
138080	140880	and let Microsoft and Activision kind of...
140880	143280	And all the other marketing research companies today are going,
143280	144480	Woo-hoo!
144480	146440	New business is gonna be coming soon.
146440	146760	Yeah.
146760	149600	Alright, let's stop kicking sand in these guys' faces,
149600	151840	and go back to gaming news.
151840	152960	Yes.
152960	154880	Alright.
154880	158520	So, there's some interesting things coming out this week in Japan.
158520	160400	I don't really know what you'd call this press event,
160400	163200	but it was basically the event where Microsoft says,
163200	166560	Hey, look at all the Japanese RPGs that are coming our way.
166560	174440	So, one of which, of course, is a really cool Star Ocean 4,
174440	179280	which will be making its way out to the Xbox 360 in 2009.
179280	182000	It's called Star Ocean The Last Hope,
182000	185280	and they had a trailer also being released for that,
185280	189200	and of course it's Square Enix and Tri-Aces RPG.
189200	196880	And I guess apparently the game was announced back in 2007
196880	201360	at the Square Enix party, but, you know, I don't know.
201360	202080	And it was funny, too,
202080	205600	because originally it was supposed to be a PS3 exclusive,
205600	208880	but no word yet on when it's gonna arrive on the PS3,
208880	212160	or if it will.
212160	212960	If it will?
212960	214720	That's an interesting little footnote.
214720	215440	Do you think that possibly...
215440	216640	Well, I added that, so...
216640	218960	Okay.
218960	221280	Well, I mean, this is a Microsoft press event.
221280	222960	They're not gonna say, oh, it's also on PS3.
222960	223840	Ah, yes, it makes sense.
223840	225120	I think it's still coming to PS3,
225120	226720	probably about the same time frame
226720	228640	as a lot of these types of games do.
228640	230160	There's another role-playing game coming out
230160	232400	called Tales of Vesperia is coming out,
232400	235600	and it's coming out in Japan in August of 2008,
235600	236400	August 7th specifically.
236400	237520	And the US, too.
237520	239040	Is it coming out the US the same time?
239040	239840	Around the same time.
239840	241120	Around the same time, but we don't have...
241120	242240	It'll also be mid-August.
243040	243760	Is it really?
243760	244960	Yeah, so far.
244960	246560	That wasn't part of this press release.
246560	248000	Do you know something I don't?
248000	250080	Oh, I know that it's coming out mid-August.
250080	250480	All right.
251200	252480	I don't remember the exact date,
252480	253600	but it's coming out mid-August.
253600	254800	It still looks pretty cool.
254800	256640	It's a Namco Bandai RPG,
256640	259360	which I believe Eternal Sonata was by them as well.
259360	261920	And that game was kind of one of those games
261920	263360	that slipped under some people's radars,
263360	264800	but it's great.
264800	266000	It's a great game.
266000	268160	So I'm hoping this game follows in that.
268160	273280	It's gonna be 37,800 yen for the bundle,
274240	275360	because the game is actually gonna get
275360	277440	its own Xbox 360 bundle over in Japan
277440	279440	to try and tap into that market
279440	282720	that just won't pick up on Xbox 360.
282720	285760	The Japanese are really resistant to Xbox 360,
285760	287760	but trying to use some of these upcoming role-playing games,
287760	289040	which all look pretty rad,
289760	291760	to try and woo some of the Japanese players
291760	293600	over to Xbox 360.
293600	295120	Hasn't worked so far.
295120	297520	Yeah, and I have a feeling they're all too busy
297520	299600	playing Metal Gear Solid 4 to care this week,
299600	300560	sorry to say.
300560	302160	Well, another game that...
302160	302660	But I'll buy it.
303920	304720	Okay.
304720	307920	Oh, another game that Squenix published
309440	312400	is actually developed by Tri-Ace for Xbox 360.
313440	317040	Infinite Undiscovery has ship dates
317040	319840	for North America and Europe,
319840	321920	being 9.2 and 9.5, respectively,
321920	327200	and proposed in-store dates of September 11th
327200	328880	for Japan and Asia.
328880	332880	So you can read about it if you read Japanese on Famitsu.
332880	335840	Oh, by the way, this was like my favorite
335840	337280	out of all those role-playing games I saw,
337280	338480	this Infinite Undiscovery.
338480	339360	This looks pretty sweet.
340880	342880	And the name is very interesting.
342880	345920	It's really weird that we're getting it before Japan.
345920	347440	It's shipping on that day.
347440	350240	But, well, it's so gonna be there next day.
350240	351600	I'll still be able to walk into a store
351600	355280	and get it before the Japanese listener person,
355280	357760	which is strange because with role-playing games,
357760	359600	I can't think of many times that happens.
360320	362480	So, but that's, I mean, it's not that much.
362480	363360	It's only like a week.
363360	364240	But I think it's pretty cool.
364240	367680	They at least obviously develop the games at the same time.
367680	368240	Yes.
368240	369040	Pretty neat.
369040	370400	And then the last game, of course,
370400	372160	which we've seen a little bit of trailers on,
372160	375440	I think during E3 and maybe Tokyo Game Show.
375440	376320	I don't remember.
376320	378400	But the last title, of course,
378400	382000	The Last Remnant will be getting an Xbox 360 release.
382640	385760	This is the one that's using the Unreal 3 engine
385760	389200	that was first announced in 2007.
389200	393520	And the game is supposed to be, I guess,
393520	395440	supposed to be launching simultaneously
395440	398320	on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan,
399200	403360	North America and Europe, I guess, a little bit later.
403360	405520	But now it looks like they're gonna get
405520	411280	a simultaneous worldwide launch in all three territories.
411280	413680	So it's supposed to come sometime this winter.
416160	416800	Interesting.
416800	420640	Interesting, so coming soon is basically what they've said.
420640	420960	The fall.
421680	422240	Interesting.
422240	423840	Hey, I'm actually curious because I
423840	426400	know a lot of our listeners are into these RPG-type games
426400	427200	because we are.
427200	429360	I'm kind of curious, chat room, out of these games
429360	432320	we just talked about, Star Ocean, Tales of Vesperia,
432320	434240	Infinite Undiscovery, Last Remnant,
434240	437120	is there any that, and kind of including other RPGs
437120	439280	we know are in the tailpipe for Xbox 360,
439280	441440	such as Blue Dragon 2, I think, has been confirmed,
441440	443360	as well as the Lost Odyssey sequel.
443360	445680	I'm kind of curious, those of you guys in chat,
445680	448400	are any of these catching your interest?
449200	450560	And if so, which one?
450560	451360	And why?
452960	455120	Which one do you think you're more interested in
455120	455680	over the others?
455680	457520	I already have Infinite Undiscovery on order,
457520	459040	same with Tales.
459040	461440	And then there's also the PS3 Sega one
461440	465120	that's coming out that I can't remember the name off
465120	466400	the top of my head right now.
466400	469200	But that one I also have on order.
469760	471280	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you
471280	473360	want to join in on the instant discussion there.
473360	475760	If you're listening live to us on this Sunday evening.
475760	477840	As well as five copies of Saints Row 2
477840	480160	for each one of our Xbox 360s.
480160	480660	Nice.
481360	482640	We'll move, we'll move.
482640	483140	Huh?
484640	486000	You asked a question of us.
486880	490000	Oh, I was asking chat, but certainly
490000	491840	if you have an opinion too, please.
491840	494720	I'm sort of thinking that Infinite Undiscovery,
494720	496800	but it depends on if I have time.
497840	499200	Always depends on time.
499200	499700	That's all right.
501040	502720	We'll go back to that question in just a minute.
502720	505520	Let me address this though related to Xbox stories.
506160	509280	Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
509920	513360	The Xbox Live Arcade game with the longest freaking title ever.
513360	514800	You know it's going into beta.
514800	517760	And the beta was purchased through Commando 3,
517760	520160	which just went on Xbox Live Arcade this past week.
520880	524000	That beta is going to open up on June 25th.
524000	527280	That would be next Wednesday is when
527280	528560	this beta is going to go live.
528560	530160	Now remember about the beta though,
530160	533200	you only basically get Ken Ryu in one stage.
533200	535840	So it's not really a whole lot to the game.
535840	538640	But hey, at least you do get to take a peek
538640	540560	at what this game is going to look like.
540560	543520	So again, that all starts on June 25th.
545600	547680	Going to the question that I asked earlier,
547680	549440	looking in chat at some of the answers here.
550480	550880	Let's see.
550880	553120	Joshi16 says, I don't have the time anymore.
553120	554720	I want to try Eternal Sonata.
554720	555920	I'm so behind.
555920	558000	Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm behind on a lot of these games
558000	558560	too.
558560	559120	Damn wow.
559120	561520	GameGuru says, OLR, not really.
561520	564720	Maybe the Blue Dragon games because Blue Dragon
564720	566320	is from Team Chrono Trigger.
566320	569280	I got to tell you though, the first Blue Dragon game,
570960	572560	not what you would have hoped for.
573200	573760	It's OK.
573760	577440	It's like imagine like a Super Nintendo classic RPG
577440	578880	on an Xbox 360.
578880	580400	That's kind of what Blue Dragon was.
581280	583440	But unfortunately, the story was a little generic
583440	585680	as a lot of RPGs tended to be back then.
585680	586960	So sorry.
586960	589040	All right, that was really it.
589040	590960	We didn't get a whole lot of comments on that in chat.
590960	593200	Ospher says he wants to get a Eternal Sonata for PS3.
593200	594960	I guess they do have the extra stuff.
594960	595520	So we'll see.
597520	598880	I wish I hadn't looked at this.
600560	602080	I really wish I hadn't looked at this.
602080	602720	Well, what's that?
604720	607440	I'm not going to spoil it for anybody else at all.
607440	609600	And actually, this really isn't that bad of a spoiler.
609600	611440	But I'm still not going to say anything about it
611440	616400	because there is a voice acting casting call out
616400	618160	for a second Portal game.
619280	621120	I'm not going to say anything about it.
622720	624400	So we don't know what it is or why.
624400	625280	It's just it's out there.
625280	625920	I know why.
625920	626880	I know what it is now.
626880	627920	But it's a spoilery.
627920	629600	I don't want to spoil it for anybody.
629600	630080	All right.
630080	636320	If you want to know, you can actually hunt it down on a...
636320	638480	I'm not in most gaming blogs around the story this week.
638480	639200	But I'm not sure.
639200	641520	I'm not going to ruin it.
641520	645440	I got to say, though, that the premise sounds awesome.
647440	650240	From what I read of it, it sounds very interesting.
650240	651120	You knew it was coming.
651120	652960	You knew a Portal 2 had to happen somehow.
652960	656480	So I'm glad they will make it work one way or the other.
657360	657840	We'll see.
659280	659680	All right.
662480	666880	Anyways, so there's some interesting stuff coming out.
666880	670320	Now, probably from a very unlikely event as well.
670960	678400	The Major League of Gaming, they actually had a Halo 3 competition that's happened recently.
678400	684320	And one of the surprises that they had for their contestants was a new map for Halo 3
684320	685760	called Cold Storage.
685760	694720	And what Cold Storage is, is actually a remake or, I guess, a map that resembles the Chill
694720	696960	Out level from the first Halo games.
696960	698800	So it's kind of interesting.
698800	702560	It kind of falls in line with, you know, the other maps that have been released.
702560	708960	Kind of a lot of remakes and that, I guess, inspired by previous game maps and stuff like
708960	709360	that.
709360	713920	So no word on when this will be coming to us, but probably something like in the fall
713920	716400	or summer, you know, another map pack.
717760	718400	But pretty cool.
720080	720560	All right.
721600	722960	Sounds interesting.
722960	725600	Although, I'm kind of over Halo 3.
725600	727280	I don't know about the rest of y'all.
727280	731040	But Halo 3 didn't have the lasting power that Halo 2 did, sadly.
732080	732880	I don't know.
732880	733680	All right.
733680	737200	The Maw is a new game that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
737200	740320	And I don't know, the first time I look at this and I see this little creature in a little
740320	744400	screenshot from the Maw, I think it's like something I see out of Spore or something.
744400	752160	But actually, what Maw is, is that is kind of the little mouth creature on a pet blob
752160	753440	that is featured in the game.
754320	760080	You can actually use this little creature to eat, like, a house or just lots of little
760080	760560	different things.
760560	760880	I don't know.
760880	763360	It kind of sounds different, like Katamari Dimashius in a way.
764560	766480	It's a little alien, Frank.
766480	770640	And you use the Maw's growth and the power's M-A-W.
770640	771360	Thought so.
771360	771860	Yeah.
773200	776960	And basically, what you do, you say hello to creatures, then eat them.
776960	778560	And they double as power ups.
778560	781760	Twisted Pixel is the people behind the game.
781760	786480	And they promise that they will have a lengthy single player mode, cut scenes that are described
786480	791840	as intense, and cutting edge graphics for Xbox Live Arcade.
791840	793440	No word on when this will be out.
793440	795520	Hopefully a little sooner than Castle Crashers.
796960	797360	We'll see.
798960	802720	Meanwhile, let's take a look at what you guys have to say in our mailbag.
802720	808240	Every week we open up our mailbag to you guys to send us your emails and your love and adoration
808240	809200	or your hate mail.
809200	812240	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
812240	813680	Darkstalker's going to dive in right now.
813680	814640	Pick a few of her favorites.
814640	815680	Read them for you.
815680	818000	We got a bunch of them, but they're not that long.
818000	818500	OK.
819440	824480	First one comes from, I'm just going to say James.
825520	828640	Is there a date on how long Deoxys is available?
828640	834320	I'm in Germany, and my cartridge is in Texas to get the event item for Darkrai.
834320	837840	So, I may need to ask someone to take the cartridge to Gamestop.
839120	840960	Um, I didn't see.
840960	842240	I don't remember seeing one either.
842240	844960	I will try to find the answer for the reason next to the email.
846560	849280	You may have to get a friend over here to get it for you or something somehow.
850720	853200	This one comes from our friend in Kenya.
854720	858000	Hi, O.R. I've been listening to tonight's show and I'm thrilled you read my email.
858000	858560	Wait, no.
858560	859360	This guy's fake.
859360	859920	I proved it.
860560	861920	He's on our Facebook community.
861920	863520	OK. The actual name that emailed us.
863520	864560	I got you.
864560	865520	I caught you.
865520	868960	So, now I want to know what the hell, what is this?
868960	869920	Go ahead and read the email.
869920	870480	I'm going to read it.
870480	871920	That's what I said because I'm, you know.
871920	872480	All right.
872480	876080	It's like, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to prove who I am, but I will try and find a
876080	879280	way to get a hold of the camera to take a picture of Samara's Cafe.
880400	882560	Have a good night there in the USA from Kenya.
882560	883440	That's from Taiwan.
884560	887040	I just want to know, what the hell is this?
887840	888960	Just come clean.
888960	889680	I caught you.
889680	892800	You're, you're, the name in your email is in our Facebook community.
894800	895920	You got caught.
895920	896720	Now admit it.
896720	897280	All right.
897280	897920	Next email.
899120	900480	But I still want to see the picture.
900480	902320	I mean, I kind of want to see what you, what we're going to do.
903520	909520	I mean, I, I, I, I don't have a, this one comes from the guy with cool email.
909520	910000	Salt-Tec.
911440	915920	Just wondering if any of you know whether Sony ever plans to let you play PSP games
915920	917760	using your PS3 via remote play.
917760	922000	I hate the PSP's control, but it seems all the games I like are coming out for it, i.e.
922000	924880	Kingdom Hearts 3, God of War 3, Final Fantasy 7.
926000	930400	It just seems like it would be smart because it's only, only take an update to do.
930400	934560	And I know personally that a few of my friends would pick up both the PS3 and PSP just to
934560	938640	do this and the others, since they already have a PS3, would just buy the PSP.
938640	939760	He means Crisis Core.
939760	940720	That's what I meant.
940720	941040	Yeah.
941040	941840	That's what I was thinking.
942880	944480	Awesome show, never let it stop.
944480	945040	Salt-Tec.
945040	946960	Awesome show, never let it stop, Salt-Tec.
949600	949840	Okay.
951200	954080	So, wait, wait, was the question, should he get the PSP or?
954960	956560	If they're ever gonna have the remote play.
957200	958800	Oh, remote play on PSP.
959600	961440	I thought they already had something like that.
961440	966160	I think he's talking about in the other direction where you can play PSP games on your PS3.
966160	969680	Oh, um, maybe someday.
970320	972560	You know what would be a little bit better is, well,
972560	976000	I guess you could emulate it, but like, that'd be kind of cool.
976000	981200	They have a little $20 peripheral or something like that that just pop the UMD into and play
981200	981680	it that way.
981680	983680	Well, here's, here's the other thing on those new PSPs.
983680	986960	They have the video out, which is essentially playing them on your TV anyway.
986960	987760	That's not exactly.
988720	990000	The complaint was about the controller.
990880	995600	I can understand that and maybe Sony will do that whole like compatibility and reverse
995600	1000400	thing, but because of the video out and because Sony doesn't feel that their controller sucks,
1000400	1001600	don't hold your breath.
1001600	1006640	Sorry, by the way, I'm looking at a story about that Pokemon event to go back to the
1006640	1007200	last email.
1007920	1012480	It says that it's only on the weekends of June 20th and June 27th.
1012480	1017280	I'm sorry to say June 30th, I think is the last day that this is available.
1017280	1020000	So sorry to our friend in Germany.
1020000	1022000	You'll have to get somebody over here to get it for you.
1022000	1025600	Quick FedEx your cartridge out here or find a cheat code or something.
1025600	1026640	Yeah, sorry.
1026640	1028160	Um, this comes from Geek Boy.
1028160	1033680	Hey, OLR crew, I've been looking unsuccessfully for free lessons in programming languages.
1033680	1039520	I've wanted to learn how to learn programming languages for some time now, and I wanted
1039520	1042160	to know if you knew any good websites and which languages I should learn.
1042160	1043040	Thanks, Geek Boy.
1045440	1048240	Well, you can learn to learn anything, I suppose.
1048240	1056160	But if you want to start off, you know, easy, try something like, you know, Visual Basic,
1056160	1059680	maybe because you can use that in Word and all kinds of other programs.
1059680	1060160	You know what?
1060160	1062800	If you ain't writing in ZZT, you ain't shit.
1065760	1066480	I'm just kidding.
1067760	1069840	No, you need to learn Fortran.
1070800	1071760	Jeez, Pascal.
1071760	1072480	How about Logo?
1074560	1075360	No, just kidding.
1075920	1077520	You know, here's the thing.
1077520	1081120	Honestly, if you really want to start with programming, like if you don't even really
1081120	1083920	have your foot, because he says he doesn't really have his foot in the door at all.
1083920	1090160	I don't like free C. Well, not even that, but my suggestion go to one of these games
1090160	1091440	that is a make your own game.
1091440	1097040	And even though I kind of joke about ZZT, that game will teach you a lot about programming,
1097040	1098480	even though it's like years old.
1098480	1104000	And a lot of these games that are game maker type games, it's a really good place to start
1104000	1109280	because programming and all that is a lot about logic and a way of thinking and debugging
1109280	1109840	your stuff.
1109840	1111200	I know it's logical.
1111200	1116240	I hey, look, when I originally went to college, I was studying originally like computer programming
1116240	1118400	and I started with a C++ class.
1118400	1119680	I hated it.
1119680	1121440	And I decided this is not for me.
1121440	1127600	I quit database management because as soon as I went through the basic stuff, I was like,
1127600	1128160	I hate this.
1129120	1133840	There's a lot of people in chat yelling C++, Java, C, basic.
1134960	1139760	I would say honestly, I don't know who uses basic anymore, but why not?
1139760	1142080	But here's the thing.
1142080	1147920	Start with one of these game maker type programs that teach you how to think logically and
1147920	1149280	debug your games.
1149280	1151680	Then you're ready to start with a programming language.
1151680	1152240	Think about it.
1153520	1155040	And seriously, check out ZZT.
1155040	1155520	It rocks.
1156160	1158560	Xenocore says turn him to game maker seven.
1158560	1160320	Make a game while you learn coding techniques.
1160320	1163760	That's exactly the kind of thing I'm thinking is a good starting point because if you try
1163760	1167040	to just jump in and learn C, you're going to be in over your head, buddy.
1167040	1172720	Yeah, you've got to have the, you always build up to whatever.
1172720	1173120	Yeah.
1173120	1176160	And Alpha Canagram says TI-83 basic for the win.
1176160	1177760	Hell yeah, I had one.
1178320	1182080	I had the Texas Instruments computer that had the little cartridges that you slid on
1182080	1182800	the side.
1182800	1184560	And I had the basic book.
1184560	1188080	I will write you a Commodore 64 basic program right now.
1188080	1188560	Here we go.
1189120	1195440	10 space, print space, quote, Rob is awesome, quote, enter.
1195440	1199520	20 space, go to 10, enter, run.
1201040	1202560	Programming lesson here on OLR.
1203200	1205920	Make sure you've got plenty of printer paper.
1205920	1207200	Exactly.
1207200	1208640	You know, I have that icon, though.
1208640	1210560	Did you see my icon that I made a long time ago?
1211280	1214080	This is a 10 home.
1214080	1215360	Yes, sweet home.
1216400	1217840	30 go to 10.
1217840	1218960	Yeah, I remember that.
1218960	1219460	Yeah.
1220800	1224160	Anyway, this one comes from Katamari's Forever.
1224160	1228560	First of all, I want to thank you, OLR, for naming Space Channel 5 your classic game of
1228560	1229520	the week last week.
1229520	1231680	I was beaming with excitement when Jamie said those words.
1231680	1234160	I actually thank Sauce for that because she's the one who told me to do it.
1236160	1237040	Thank you, Sauce.
1237040	1237520	Thank you.
1237520	1239760	Even though you're not listening to us to watch Tony Awards.
1240720	1242640	She didn't hear that now because she's watching Tony Awards.
1243680	1247760	Second, I want to give a shout out to an OLR me, Carizzle.
1248480	1252320	It's nice that I found him on another forum, Red Flag Deals.
1252320	1255760	Do you get excited when you see a random OLR me around an event?
1257040	1257540	Yeah.
1258400	1266720	And by the way, this reminds me, I finally got around to making a character on the Ragnarok
1266720	1268880	server that you have to guess which one I'm playing on.
1268880	1270960	Named Dark Sakura with the party OLR me.
1270960	1272880	So if you find me, you get a prize.
1273440	1274640	I'm not going to tell you where I am, though.
1275280	1275840	Nice.
1275840	1276640	Only a few people know.
1278000	1281040	And third, remember when someone nuked your article from Wikipedia?
1281040	1284960	I was laughing out loud when I found out that under the beautiful Katamari article was none
1284960	1289280	other than you, OLR, when the article referenced the story you posted about the game.
1289280	1290160	I guess you're in place.
1290160	1291200	Oh, yeah, that.
1291200	1293520	I guess you're in places you think you're not in.
1293520	1297280	Anyway, wanted to say I'm playing Space Channel 5 Part 2 now and talk to you later.
1297280	1298480	Katamari's forever.
1298480	1298980	Hey, yes.
1299840	1300720	Go ahead.
1300720	1301360	Rob.
1301360	1301860	What?
1302640	1304400	Remember that Still Alive parody thread?
1304400	1306880	Well, I finished the song and put it on this email.
1306880	1307360	Please listen.
1307360	1309920	It would be greatly appreciated or maybe put in a bonus segment.
1309920	1311360	How about we make that our fortune cookie?
1311360	1314480	We or well, better yet was so the podcast listeners can hear it.
1314480	1318240	We will play at the end of the show tonight because I did listen to it.
1318240	1320320	I can't believe somebody actually did it.
1320320	1323520	So we will definitely play it at the end of the show and you rock for doing it.
1324160	1325760	Here's what I want to ask about Wikipedia.
1325760	1328480	You know, not only were we linked from that beautiful Katamari article,
1328480	1331040	we were also linked from the Guitar Hero 80s edition article.
1331040	1333280	I don't even remember why what we had to do with that game.
1333280	1334400	I guess we were.
1334400	1335920	Did we announce it early or something?
1335920	1337920	I don't remember Guitar Hero 80s edition.
1338560	1339760	What about 80s edition?
1339760	1342160	We're linked from the article in Wikipedia.
1342160	1344320	Like, for some reason, we're referenced in the article.
1344320	1345040	I don't remember why.
1345040	1346960	I think we may talk about it or whatever.
1346960	1347460	Whatever.
1348400	1349040	Here's my question.
1349040	1351840	Did anyone ever try to recreate the wiki article?
1351840	1352720	They should.
1352720	1353760	I think so, too.
1353760	1358400	The problem, the reason why it got nuked is because they said it wasn't sourced or that
1361040	1362560	it didn't prove its relevance or whatever.
1362560	1364320	But dude, we're coming up on our sixth birthday.
1364960	1367600	We're gonna be like one of the longest running shows on the net, right?
1367600	1368240	Right.
1368240	1370080	Oh, you're giving me a second, yep, I found it.
1370080	1370960	It's under history.
1372000	1378080	Guitar Hero Encore Rock C80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar
1378080	1379600	Hero 1980s edition.
1379600	1383120	Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an
1383120	1386960	Activision announcement, though no other source has cited this announcement.
1386960	1392480	Activision officially revealed the first details of the game as May 11th, 2007, in addition
1392480	1395760	to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rock C80s.
1395760	1398640	I rem- you know what, it never came out, though, in that time.
1398640	1399920	I remember what it was, though.
1399920	1406560	It was some type of, like, sales presentation thing that you- that you had that we- I remember
1406560	1407120	that's what it was.
1407120	1408320	That's why no one else would have had it.
1409520	1409760	Yeah.
1410400	1412240	It was from, uh, I remember what it was from.
1412240	1418560	It was from, uh, Destination PlayStation because that's, uh, it's retailers only.
1418560	1419040	No press.
1419920	1420320	Uh-huh.
1421120	1424400	This one goes for the World of Warcraft players.
1425040	1425600	Yay!
1425600	1427440	From Lord Katakos.
1428640	1430320	What server you guys play WoW on?
1431040	1435920	Also, my 77 priest I mailed you about, like, two months ago was hacked, but I restarted
1435920	1441280	on a private server called D- Dagon MS, I guess, and I'm now level 168.
1442160	1443760	Wait, you can't be that high in WoW.
1443760	1446560	Are you sure this is about WoW, or is this, uh, R- uh, Ragnarok?
1447840	1448640	Can you go to 168?
1448640	1449680	No, maybe it is.
1449680	1450960	No, this is what you play WoW on.
1452080	1453360	You can't go to level 168 in WoW.
1453360	1453860	Private server?
1453860	1455940	Maybe on a private server.
1455940	1456580	That's what he just said.
1456580	1457620	He's playing on a private server.
1457620	1458420	Oh.
1458420	1460100	I'm gonna look this- the server up.
1460100	1462100	Um, anyway, you guys are gladly set to rob.
1462100	1463220	He only just finished Khara.
1465460	1469540	Um, I would- I- we- I'm on the Ravencrest server on normal OLR.
1469540	1471060	I don't play on a pirated server.
1471060	1475220	Um, I play on Ravencrest because it sounds like Ravenclaw from Harry Potter.
1475220	1475780	Horde side.
1475780	1476900	Horde has cookies.
1476900	1481540	Okay, I looked up, uh, Dagon MS, and it's a freaking, um, um, MapleStory.
1481540	1483780	MapleStory?
1485620	1486340	Get out of here!
1487460	1488180	I'm just kidding.
1488180	1489940	Jamie doesn't play MapleStory.
1489940	1490440	The end.
1492020	1493220	Help me don't play that.
1493220	1500420	And, um, by the way, the, um, uh, OL Army Guild on WoW really isn't the OL Army Guild
1500420	1501060	on WoW anymore.
1501060	1506660	It's like, uh, Rob's offline friends and their friends playing in a guild.
1506660	1510660	So, if you're going to join our guild, I'm all for having listeners in there because
1510660	1515620	we still go by the, uh, OL Army creative, uh, don't be an asshole when you play games.
1515620	1519460	But, um, you know, don't expect that you're going to run into a whole lot of other OLR
1519460	1520180	listeners on there.
1520180	1521300	But we have fun.
1521300	1525940	If any- if anyone wants to find out, wants to, um, and it's only going to be a casual
1525940	1529380	guild, I'm not going to let anyone else invite anyone who- unless I trust them.
1529380	1535460	But, um, find me on, um, uh, what is that chat thing we use?
1535460	1536340	IRC.
1536340	1536980	There you go.
1536980	1538340	And, um, I might tell you.
1538340	1543300	Um, I want to point out, too, because this is in the Justin TV chat, going back to the,
1543300	1547780	uh, kid who was asking about the programming languages, wanting to know more about where
1547780	1548820	to start with that.
1548820	1554420	Um, Akuma JP, who works for, like, you know, game companies in Japan, suggests, download
1554420	1556420	the iPhone SDK.
1556420	1557060	It's fun.
1557060	1557940	Start from there.
1557940	1558660	Not C, though.
1559380	1560340	I didn't even think about that.
1560340	1562500	There's that whole new, uh, development kit that iPhones got.
1562500	1563700	I might get the Twitter thingy for it.
1563700	1564500	That might be kind of fun.
1565540	1566260	Good suggestion.
1566260	1568180	It's actually officially supported now.
1568180	1568820	Hmm.
1568820	1570980	Okay, next email from Amplitude.
1570980	1571860	Yes, please.
1571860	1573620	Hey, OLR, Amplitude here.
1574660	1578260	I'm listening to part B of this week's show at work, and the whole tangent on how awesome
1578260	1581940	arcades used to really, uh, be really got me to start thinking.
1581940	1585860	We, or at least those of us from that era, certainly can name some arcades that are on
1585860	1589140	the decline, and what happened, but reminiscing will only get us so far.
1589140	1592660	I feel like we never quite found an explanation for this.
1592660	1596580	Can we point fingers at corporate America and say that things were brought, um, were
1596580	1598980	bought out and consequently ambushed?
1598980	1602100	But is anyone else looking at it from a different perspective?
1602100	1605060	What about the kids that go to the arcades or lack thereof?
1605060	1608660	Nowadays, if you were spotted at a local arcade, you're pegged as a gamer, and all the
1608660	1612500	stereotypes are realized, and you begin to accumulate what can only be described as
1612500	1613140	loser points.
1614260	1617220	I don't know about you, but I remember when going to the arcade with your friends was
1617220	1618100	the cool thing to do.
1618660	1623060	I guess my main point is that while arcades have gone downhill because of buyouts, no
1623060	1626500	one goes to them anymore, and perhaps that's the reason why they're losing interest in
1626500	1627220	being shut down.
1627780	1630100	Sorry for the long email slash rant amplitude.
1630100	1630420	P.S.
1630420	1634180	This email brought to you by subject hometown here, home of the test subject here.
1635620	1637780	Um, I see what you did there.
1637780	1639300	Uh, good thought.
1639300	1640580	I, I don't know.
1640580	1644100	I don't think we ever did get down to the bottom of what happened to arcades, and I,
1644740	1646740	there was money to be made in birthday parties.
1646740	1648900	Maybe we should do our first investigative story.
1648900	1651220	An invest, an OLR investigative report.
1651220	1651700	Don't don't.
1651700	1652740	Seriously.
1652740	1653380	Maybe.
1653380	1653940	We should.
1653940	1658420	Okay, Jamie, you head that up because I wouldn't even know where to begin to college and works
1658420	1659220	full time.
1659220	1662180	Rob works full time and Rob has other things going on too.
1662180	1662500	Okay.
1662500	1668500	You know, so don't you were full time and is very busy with other things.
1668500	1669060	You're not me.
1669940	1670500	Get on that.
1671220	1671620	All right.
1671620	1673620	There's a shiny dollar in it for you.
1674900	1680340	I have a Susan B with your name on it, but, but I do want to one part of the email said
1680340	1682580	people don't go because they're afraid of being a nerd.
1682580	1685700	Uh, no, no, that can't be true of people.
1685700	1687540	People are dorks because they go to arcades.
1688660	1690100	I can't believe that's true.
1690740	1694340	Loki Jamie and Loki Jamie and I would never have met if it wasn't for the arcade.
1694340	1699300	I don't, of course, you know, then again, I got called a geek earlier this week, so
1699300	1702980	I don't know by some guy who doesn't know you.
1702980	1708900	I know I'm just being a bitch, but seriously, you know, it's like, I don't the hell with
1708900	1709860	what they think.
1709860	1714020	So what if they think you're a cheeseburger points out for programming languages, PHP,
1714020	1718420	Python, C++, Java, Ruby, Pearl, and if you learn HTML, it will be easier.
1719380	1722180	Like, okay, HTML is freaking easy.
1723860	1727300	So we're almost done.
1727300	1727700	Great.
1728500	1728900	Hello.
1728900	1729540	All right.
1729540	1731860	It is Janai from Las Vegas.
1731860	1735780	As of typing this email, I have returned from the video game live concert in Henderson,
1735780	1736500	Nevada.
1736500	1738100	It is a must see event.
1738100	1743460	I wore my Professor Layton costume and gave people gold coins that noticed who I was dressed
1743460	1743860	as.
1743860	1744360	Nice.
1745060	1748900	I was backstage for the costume contest, and even though I didn't win, I got to see Martin
1748900	1753380	Leung, the famous piano player who played the Super Mario theme blindfolded on YouTube.
1753380	1756740	I quickly said, I love your YouTube videos and you applied with a cool thank you.
1756740	1757540	And that made my day.
1758100	1761380	Awesome lighting, great music selection, both new and classic games.
1761380	1764500	And Tommy Tallarico kept changing his clothes, which was strange.
1764500	1767620	I give the show a solid 100% rating.
1767620	1770180	If it's coming to your town or close by, you must see it.
1770180	1772260	And yes, they have international dates this year.
1773860	1779380	You know, I'm really glad you read that email because it gives me a chance to say we have
1779380	1782260	a guest coming on the show, not next week, but the week after.
1782260	1785460	He's going to be on the show on the 29th, Sunday, the 29th.
1786180	1789780	Tommy Tallarico is going to be on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live.
1789780	1792820	And I will ask him for you about why the wardrobe change.
1792820	1796900	So, yeah, and we're going to, we're going to be asking him about the world tour and,
1796900	1799460	uh, you know, what, what people can expect this year and all that fun stuff.
1799460	1801940	And then all expenses paid tickets to see it overseas.
1801940	1807300	Uh, I don't push it, but I know Tommy Tallarico will be here in two weeks.
1807300	1807800	Sweet.
1808420	1809540	Cheeseburger.
1809540	1811620	I'm not reading your other email, but I'll read this one.
1812180	1813860	It's about arcades.
1813860	1817220	Hey guys, last week you talked about arcades and how cool they were.
1817220	1820180	I am 14, so I've never really been in arcades.
1820180	1824660	Sky said we have cool things in our generation, but we won't realize them until 20 years from now.
1824660	1828660	I think we'll be telling our kids about this thing called internet radio, where everyone had a voice.
1828660	1830100	At least I got some OLR.
1831620	1832980	You know, that's a cute email.
1832980	1833620	That is cute.
1833620	1835940	It is a very good, nice email.
1837220	1838020	Last one.
1838020	1838500	Yes.
1838500	1841940	By the way, just to answer the questions in chat, Tommy will not actually be here in studio
1841940	1844340	because, you know, he has this whole video games live thing going on.
1844340	1847460	He's also trying to do, um, he's going to be here in two weeks.
1847460	1853860	Live thing going on, he's also trying to do, um, but he will take a little time to plug it on our show.
1853860	1854180	Yes.
1855060	1856820	Last one comes from our very good friend.
1856820	1857380	Vandalous.
1858900	1859380	Hooray.
1859380	1859940	Miss you.
1859940	1860660	Happy father's day.
1860660	1861140	Vandalous.
1861140	1862420	Happy father's day.
1862420	1864900	He's got, I think I lost count.
1864900	1867540	I have lost count of how many children Vandalous has.
1867540	1868180	I think five.
1868740	1869300	Yeah.
1869300	1870100	It's at least five.
1870100	1871540	Happy father's day.
1871540	1872740	You've earned it.
1872740	1873460	Yes, you have.
1873460	1874260	Quite a bit.
1874260	1876500	Several times over and we miss you.
1876500	1877380	We really miss you.
1877380	1878420	Come back and visit us soon.
1878420	1879300	Mm hmm.
1879300	1882820	Um, he says, um, Hey gang, it's, uh, Terry slash Vandalous.
1882820	1884500	Um, I hope you're all doing well.
1884500	1886020	I wanted to pass on a new story.
1886020	1893300	I just blogged about in my weekend news job at www.hardocp.com.
1893300	1893540	Yeah.
1893540	1894260	Hard OCP.
1894900	1899540	Um, it's about the U S army's new recruitment tactic, um, interactive centers.
1899540	1901780	And he sent me a link to it.
1901780	1906340	Um, and, but he continues with full-size mockups, Apache helicopter simulations.
1906340	1910180	Look like America's army was just the beginning and tells us to take care.
1910180	1915860	And actually, yeah, what it is, is, um, excuse me, they're having a recruitment center set
1915860	1921700	up with simulators for full-scale, um, mockups of equipment and a gaming arena that uses,
1921700	1923540	um, America's army.
1923540	1931940	Um, so that instead of doing the whole, having a commercial to sell what you might happen,
1931940	1937300	they actually have something that in fact is even quoted, um, from a major Larry Dillard,
1937300	1940020	who's, um, a U S army marketing executive.
1940020	1944900	He said the, um, the modeling command and control systems are like those used in Iraq.
1944900	1949380	Um, they said, there's a, like we said earlier, there's an Apache simulator, um, for pilot
1949380	1954900	and co-pilot, um, that uses the flight and weapon system, a black Hawk helicopter, um,
1954900	1960180	that has four door gunner positions and, um, uh, armored Humvee vehicle simulator.
1960180	1964740	So I think that's pretty, actually, I kind of want to do that myself.
1964740	1966020	Humvee simulator.
1966020	1966500	Yeah.
1966500	1968100	With, um, turrets and that type of thing.
1969620	1971620	It's, it just makes me think of that.
1971620	1972100	What was that?
1972100	1975380	You know, the army is innovative.
1975380	1977220	They're very innovative at this stuff.
1977220	1977940	They do their job.
1977940	1981060	Well, that's all I can really say.
1981060	1982340	Smart, smart folks there.
1982980	1985380	And they're using that wonderful America's army.
1986020	1987700	Wait, whatever happened to America's army?
1987700	1988820	I think it's, oh yeah, that's right.
1988820	1990340	That game sucks.
1990340	1991700	Is it still going?
1991700	1993780	It's got, it's got a cult following to it.
1995540	1995940	All right.
1997860	1999140	That it for mailbag?
1999140	1999460	Yes.
1999460	2001140	Mailbag orange lounge, radio.com.
2001140	2002100	Let's get back to some news.
2002900	2003620	Yes.
2003620	2005540	And this is kind of funny though.
2005540	2008420	Um, apparently there is a game.
2008420	2014980	Someone noticed that's reusing oblivion's graphics and, uh, the game itself was called
2014980	2022580	uh, Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds weird anyways, and it is blatantly ripping off Elder
2022580	2023380	Scrolls Oblivion.
2023380	2030580	In fact, they had a screenshot, um, comparison and yeah, it's near identical except for maybe
2030580	2032980	the fire effects are shittier than the other game.
2033540	2041460	Um, no word, uh, uh, no word on what else, um, they may have stolen.
2041460	2045540	Um, it says, uh, apparently also, oh, there are some updates to the story.
2045540	2050340	Apparently also, um, they stole an environment from Thief Deadly Shadows as well.
2051300	2057780	And, um, apparently Joystick just heard back from the US publisher Try Synergy who told
2057780	2062820	them that the similarities between the two are striking, but we were just as shocked
2062820	2066100	as anybody else and we put the line into Majestic.
2066100	2071380	Um, we had no idea that any of this had been happening in, um, the game and things would
2071380	2072820	have been different if we had known.
2073380	2076100	And says, wait, Bethesda is making this game themselves?
2076100	2077380	No, Majestic.
2077380	2078260	It's Majestic.
2079060	2084100	The Majestic is the company making the game and it's being published by some company called
2084100	2085060	Try Synergy.
2085060	2089140	Well, Majestic actually made a phone call to Bethesda and this is what they had to say.
2089140	2102580	Anything you can do, I can do better, I can do anything better than you, no you can't, yes I can, no you can, yes I can, no you can, yes I can, yes I can, no, anything you can be.
2102580	2105620	Except in this case, they actually can't do it that much better.
2105620	2106180	No, they can't.
2106900	2109860	And, uh, that's kind of funny though.
2109860	2115700	I wonder what else they're gonna, um, it says they also think that the game stole some, um,
2115700	2122100	artwork from Diablotube, um, a shield called the Wall of Eyeless or something.
2122100	2122600	Nice.
2123300	2123860	Very nice.
2124580	2126500	So they're stealing from everybody.
2126500	2128500	Moogan, like a Moogan type game.
2128500	2129220	Doesn't it?
2129220	2134020	They could do, you know, we should have like random X-type game emulator and then let you
2134020	2135540	import whatever sprite or whatever the hell you want to do.
2135540	2139300	Yo, that kind of stuff is like semi-okay if you're making like a fan game or something
2139300	2141380	like that and maybe like Oblivion or something.
2141380	2144420	Why don't they just call this game, hi, I stole this from other games?
2144420	2145860	I don't know.
2148820	2150180	Azaku says bullshit.
2150180	2153540	Who the fuck was producing that game in green light at the copyrighted textures without
2153540	2154420	consulting a lawyer?
2156100	2156600	Hmm.
2157700	2158340	Is it bullshit?
2158900	2159780	Or is it the real deal?
2160420	2161300	Only time will tell.
2164100	2166660	Meanwhile, let's go back to some more gaming news.
2167300	2172020	In the law world, two guys are suing EA.
2172020	2174340	Hey, why would they sue EA?
2174340	2181060	Well, it has to do with the NFL lockout, basically, that EA has put on everybody else because
2181060	2182180	they have the rights.
2182180	2185540	They've actually filed the suit in a Northern California court.
2185540	2187060	It's a class action lawsuit.
2188340	2193220	And they're saying that because of the NFL license, EA is engaging in, quote, blatantly
2193220	2198020	anti-competitive conduct and they are seeking, quote, restitution and damages for those who
2198020	2202900	purchased an EA football game since August of 2005, disgorgement of all profits made
2202900	2206980	as a result of anti-competitive actions, and that the infringing agreements be declared
2206980	2208100	null and void.
2209140	2210260	They're suing the wrong people.
2211060	2213700	They need to be suing the NFL, not EA.
2213700	2214980	For signing it in the first place.
2214980	2221620	NFL was the one saying, hey, the rights for our franchise are up for grabs, OK, and then
2221620	2223540	EA happened to win the bid there.
2223540	2229220	It's NFL's fault and not EA as much as I hate to say that.
2229220	2233140	And for those of you that don't understand legal translation so much, we actually had
2233140	2237380	somebody try to simplify this lawsuit for us and they translated it for us.
2237380	2237860	Here it is.
2238660	2242340	Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
2242340	2243220	Bitch, bitch, bitch.
2244260	2245300	There it is.
2245300	2246580	That's what this lawsuit is all about.
2248580	2252500	Anyhow, stories like this, I don't know about you guys, but whenever I hear about all these
2252500	2258900	like type of like frivolous lawsuit type things, I get a little bit angsty and mad.
2258900	2261380	And that always necessitates some FUs.
2261380	2282340	To myself, I left my laptop at home and had to go back and get it.
2282340	2294100	All right, Loki, FUs is the guy in front of me at Burger King, because apparently he didn't
2294100	2295700	know what he wanted to order.
2295700	2300500	And then he proceeded to order like half the menu because I was waiting behind him for
2300500	2306020	like 10 minutes while he proceeded to wait for his food to be delivered to his car in
2306020	2308020	about five to six bags.
2308020	2308340	Nice.
2308900	2310420	Yes, I love people.
2310420	2313380	Oh, and he was smoking right there in front of the end of the window, too.
2313380	2314260	Nice, which is awesome.
2314260	2314820	He's a winner.
2317380	2322500	Um, my FU of the week goes to the root canal I had on Thursday.
2323060	2323380	Ow.
2325300	2326420	Root canals are not fun.
2327700	2330420	An FU to the fact that I think there's a problem with it.
2330420	2330740	I don't know.
2330740	2332420	I'm gonna have to see the dentist next week.
2332420	2333380	FU to dentistry.
2334980	2335860	That's my FU of the week.
2335860	2337220	Let's get back to gaming news.
2337940	2338820	Do we gotta?
2338820	2339940	We gotta.
2339940	2340260	Okay.
2341140	2342260	Um, Penny Arcade.
2343780	2344100	Cool.
2345380	2345780	I think.
2346340	2346980	Nope, I'm wrong.
2347940	2349460	Oh, did you get ahead of yourself?
2349460	2349940	Yeah.
2349940	2351700	Penny Arcade coming up soon.
2351700	2351940	Yes.
2351940	2352820	Later in the program.
2353860	2354500	Squeamix.
2355060	2355300	Yes.
2356100	2363860	Um, there actually is a trailer up for the new MMO concerto gate and it's going to be
2363860	2367700	a free MMORPG and it's pretty.
2367700	2376660	Um, it's actually the sequel to a cross gate, which was an MMO, um, that was in Japan since
2376660	2380020	2001 and it's, it's just very cute.
2381380	2383380	So I'm going to, I want to give it a try.
2383380	2385700	Hooray for free and hooray for cute, right?
2385700	2387220	As long as it's not MapleStory.
2388980	2389860	All right.
2389860	2391460	Why all the hate for MapleStory?
2391460	2391860	I don't know.
2391860	2393300	I've never even played MapleStory.
2393300	2394100	It doesn't look fun.
2394820	2396260	Oh, I'm sorry.
2396260	2399460	You know, you may have spoiled Ragnarok online.
2400900	2402660	Ragnarok has withstood the test of time.
2403300	2405140	Yeah, sure.
2409140	2415300	One thing Ragnarok does not have that Dungeon Runners does have is a bling gnome.
2415940	2416580	That's right.
2416580	2417860	A bling gnome.
2417860	2420500	What per se is a bling gnome you may ask?
2421060	2422660	Well, I'm about to tell you.
2422660	2423700	It's a gnome with bling?
2424580	2425860	Yeah, sort of.
2425860	2431620	A bling gnome is a pet of sorts that runs around and picks up, um, all gold dropped
2431620	2436020	from bad guys while you, um, also kill other things.
2436020	2442420	And, uh, the gnome also will take, um, items or picked up dropped items that aren't rare
2442420	2443460	and eat them.
2443460	2446180	Then he poops out gold as a reward.
2446180	2447860	That's the best thing ever.
2448420	2450020	I want a gnome that poops gold.
2451620	2453780	And they have screenshots to back it up.
2453780	2461300	Yes, the bling gnome who, who set, who either has loot or woot tattooed to his stomach.
2462820	2464900	I don't know, but, uh, it's kind of funny.
2466500	2470500	And, uh, for those who may not be familiar with Dungeon Runner, it is a free MMO.
2470500	2475620	So where can you check this game out if you want to see this, uh, amazing, um, pooping
2475620	2476260	gnome?
2476260	2477700	DungeonRunners.com.
2477700	2480260	Oh, well, I should have been able to figure that one out, huh?
2480260	2482100	Oh my God, this is the best thing ever.
2482100	2483860	And he says he does have woot on him.
2483860	2486020	And he, I think it's loot.
2486020	2488900	Oh, I thought it says, no, it could be a little of both.
2489620	2491060	Maybe woot on the front and loot on the back.
2491060	2497460	Maybe it's pooped because he poops out, you know, gold.
2497460	2500180	Well, um, Hey, who wouldn't want to know that poops out gold?
2500180	2500980	I mean, that's awesome.
2501540	2503940	Um, I really don't know how to follow up that story.
2503940	2509940	So I'll just say in other PC gaming news, civilization four is getting a new spinoff.
2509940	2512420	It's civilization four colonization.
2512420	2517220	It is not an expansion to the existing civilization four, um, because you're actually not going
2517220	2520020	to need the original Civ four to actually play this game.
2520020	2525460	In fact, if you think way back, if you remember old school civilization, like I do the actual
2525460	2531620	first sequel to civilization of sorts, wasn't civilization two, it was a game called colonization
2531620	2535940	where you could play as like, I think you played as the British, the French, the Spanish,
2535940	2536660	or the Dutch.
2536660	2542420	I want to say, and you could actually play to colonize the new world or America.
2542420	2543220	No, it wasn't Mars.
2543220	2544660	You were actually playing Colin.
2544660	2548420	You were colonizing the new world and it was kind of just a whole like different type of
2548420	2550580	game, but very similar to the civilization gameplay.
2550580	2555060	Well, basically they're remaking it and putting the Civ four name on it to see if it sells
2555060	2558100	a little better this time, I suppose, but it's kind of neat that they're going back
2558100	2559620	and re revisiting it.
2559620	2563380	So, uh, two K games is, uh, announced this and saying that the game will have all new
2563380	2568180	graphics, um, I guess that's all new from the previous colonization, cause honestly
2568180	2570340	it looks like it's just being done in the Civ four engine.
2570340	2571300	Not that that's a bad thing.
2573300	2576100	And it's going to have an improved diplomacy system.
2576100	2577780	So should be pretty interesting.
2577780	2578420	So check that out.
2578420	2579860	Civ four colonization.
2579860	2582020	I'll be very curious to see how that compares to the original.
2584420	2586180	Maybe it will be fun.
2588020	2590820	So, um, remember that thing about me seeing penny arcade earlier?
2590820	2593300	Well, um, here it is.
2593300	2596100	How's that for like your, you know, tremendous long wait, whatever.
2596660	2604020	Um, the penny arcade game is now available on steam and, um, it's called a penny arcade
2604020	2606820	adventures on the rain slick precipice of darkness.
2606820	2613780	Episode one is there at www dot steam games.com.
2614500	2619380	Um, and it will also be offering the future, um, uh, episodes there.
2619380	2622260	And there are achievements available for steam purchasers.
2623300	2624660	So, uh, go check it out.
2625460	2626900	And by the way, the game is very funny.
2628260	2629300	There's our first review.
2629860	2630580	You heard it here.
2630580	2631620	If you haven't heard.
2632580	2633780	Yeah, you have.
2633780	2637460	Now, you know, and knowing is half the battle or whatever.
2638020	2640100	Um, yeah, I hate you.
2640660	2641460	I hate you too.
2642260	2642660	Okay.
2643700	2644340	You know me.
2644340	2651460	You know me well, uh, never when your nights two is getting yet another expansion.
2651460	2658180	Um, the new expansions being called storm of Z her, and it's going to be the second
2658180	2664820	expansion, um, for the game that came out in 2006, it will add a single player campaign
2664820	2667780	with approximately 15 hours of gameplay.
2667780	2672340	It'll add a new classes, spells, creatures, and a new playable race.
2672340	2678500	Uh, also there is a new overland map that is being introduced that allow players to
2678500	2681220	explore, um, the shoot.
2681220	2686820	It looks like a Chilton peninsula sword coast and, uh, Samarit.
2687460	2693380	And it looks like they also have got, um, Hmm.
2693380	2694900	Looks like that's pretty much it.
2694900	2697540	And it's due out, I guess the fourth quarter of this year.
2697540	2700340	So something around Christmas, perhaps.
2700340	2703380	Isn't it funny that we started off tonight with the D and D story and now we're ending
2703380	2706340	with a, you know, game that a lot of D and D players love never winter nights.
2706340	2709540	Cause you can kind of make your own, um, scenarios in there.
2710180	2711780	Jamie's giving me the metal hand right there.
2711780	2712420	All right.
2712420	2714820	Um, w what?
2716100	2717140	The camera's too far over.
2717140	2720100	I was trying to insert my, oh no, it's way too far over.
2720820	2722660	You gotta be able to get to about different Rob.
2723780	2724660	There you go.
2724660	2725060	All right.
2725060	2730340	Uh, one last story tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line www dot orange

2740260	2742420	But first one more story for you guys.
2742420	2747700	And, um, it's a little bit of a retro, uh, some retro goodness.
2747700	2748260	Quick.
2748260	2749780	How do you get 30 lives in Contra?
2751140	2753140	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.
2753140	2753700	Exactly.
2753700	2756020	Everybody knows the famous Konami code, right?
2756020	2759140	Well, how do you get all of the power-ups in, um, Gradius?
2759700	2762340	Uh, you pause the game and then up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.
2762340	2763220	How do you do it in Proteus?
2763220	2764900	Uh, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA star.
2764900	2765300	Backwards.
2765860	2766340	Whatever.
2767060	2767700	Here's the thing.
2767700	2769780	So everybody knows that fricking Konami code.
2769780	2775220	Well, what's funny is that, um, you can actually use this code in Google reader.
2776580	2780500	Seriously, this code works in Google reader for presented from Google.
2780500	2784340	If you put up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA on your keyboard,
2784340	2787140	and you don't have to hit start because there is no start key on your keyboard.
2787140	2791540	Um, all of your unread items will be reset to 30.
2791540	2795860	And a little Ninja will come on the screen to watch you surf RSS feeds.
2798580	2800580	And you might be asking why.
2800580	2802980	And to that, I say, why the hell not?
2804020	2804580	There you have it.
2804580	2806420	Let's go to the phones and take some calls.
2806420	2808580	If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2808580	2809700	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2809700	2810580	Who's this?
2811540	2813860	Hi, this is Zorman calling in today.
2813860	2814180	Hi.
2816340	2820180	I'm just calling in today because I just know that never gets out before came out.
2820180	2822180	And that's why you let everybody know that I'm
2822180	2825540	basically not the type of person just bored into the hype.
2827540	2832820	And I'm a kind of believer that I know that Loki has a little get solid and everything,
2832820	2835780	but like, does anybody ever believe that there's going to be a good chance
2835780	2837300	that the game's going to come out?
2837300	2839780	Xbox 360.
2839780	2842580	So you think this game is going to come out for Xbox 360.
2842580	2846340	So somebody like me who's thinking of taking the plunge to get PlayStation 3
2846340	2848660	soon to play a game like this ought to just wait.
2849780	2850980	Exactly.
2850980	2855780	OK, you know, I got to ask why, because this story comes up a lot where, you know,
2855780	2858900	there's the OMG is going to come out on 360 and then Konami says, no, it's not.
2858900	2860500	OMG is going to come out on 360.
2860500	2861940	No, it's really not.
2861940	2867060	So what do you think is now why it's going to come out now that it's been released?
2867060	2874100	Well, one of the reasons why I think is because of the amount of if they don't pull the
2874100	2878020	certain amount of system that they need, that they're going to have to come over and notice
2878020	2887060	Bioshock and notice that was supposed to be originally for only exclusive Xbox 360.
2889060	2892980	So I just think that maybe they just kept everybody quiet and hopefully it's going to
2892980	2895540	come over to Xbox 360 to make money.
2895540	2900500	Ah, so you're saying like very similar to the reasons why Bioshock and all those games
2900500	2901460	were kept secret.
2901460	2905140	And, you know, they swore that these that system, maybe Metal Gear Solid is going to
2905140	2906020	go that same way.
2906020	2908820	Did you see that little thing that was making the rounds around the Internet this week about
2908820	2912580	kind of the joke that's inside Metal Gear about having to change discs?
2912580	2916180	And then the guy the guy says, oh, wait, no, you don't have to change this because you're
2916180	2917380	playing a Blu-ray game.
2917380	2918260	You know, you see that?
2919300	2921540	Oh, no, no, I haven't.
2921540	2923060	But I haven't seen that.
2923060	2927220	I tried my best to ignore all my friends that actually bought into the hype.
2928340	2932340	I just I just really understand because you know how Microsoft is moving over the Blu-ray
2933380	2934260	to understand that part.
2934260	2937940	And it doesn't necessarily need to be on a Blu-ray disc for it to work as well.
2937940	2943300	That's that's why I'm thinking that it's there's a good chance it could it can always
2943300	2946180	revamp it and change it, you know, for it to work with 360.
2946180	2950180	Yeah, but even if Microsoft came out with the Blu-ray player, which, you know, that
2950180	2954420	rumor we brought that rumor up on last week's show and then Monday came no announcement.
2954420	2957540	But let's say let's say Microsoft did come out with a Blu-ray player, although at this
2957540	2959860	point, I don't think they will until their next system.
2959860	2960980	But let's say let's say they did.
2960980	2962340	Let's say they came out with a Blu-ray player.
2962340	2964900	I don't think they're going to start putting out games on that player because they're
2964900	2966660	going to want to tap into their existing user base.
2966660	2969460	They don't want to suddenly say games can only be on this.
2969460	2971860	You know, I just don't think there'd be enough market for that.
2973060	2973560	Right.
2973560	2979560	I think that the user base is bigger on Xbox 360.
2979560	2981800	And I think they'd rather tap into that user base.
2982840	2988840	And I think they could be more influenced from Konami because the game isn't necessarily
2989720	2992520	it's not like they're not it's not like Sony owns Konami in any way.
2993160	2993660	Right.
2993960	2998840	Well, you know, I would love to see the Xbox 360 port happen as well, but I don't know
2998840	3003480	sometimes for whatever reason, they like to keep these things system exclusive for whatever
3003480	3004520	backdoor deals happen.
3005240	3005960	So we'll see.
3006600	3010440	Konami will keep tonight, but E3 would be a good time for them to announce it if they
3010440	3010940	wanted to.
3012360	3013000	Yeah, you're right.
3013000	3014520	And that didn't come up yet as well.
3014520	3015560	So we'll see.
3015560	3017400	Let's just all keep our fingers together.
3017400	3017900	Thanks a lot.
3018440	3018760	All right.
3018760	3019320	Take care, buddy.
3019320	3019960	Thanks for calling.
3021240	3023960	I'll be crossing my fingers for you on the Xbox 360 Metal Gear.
3023960	3024680	I don't know.
3024680	3026360	Part of me says not going to happen.
3026360	3028600	I think they've denied it so many times.
3028600	3032440	I think if they were to come out and release on 360 now, I don't know.
3032440	3035240	They'd have to have a lot of extras or something to kind of justify it.
3035240	3036040	But we'll see.
3036040	3036360	We'll see.
3036360	3036840	You never know.
3037640	3038680	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3038680	3039180	Who's this?
3040360	3041320	This is Oscar.
3041320	3042680	Hey, Oscar, what's on your mind, buddy?
3044440	3045000	Not much.
3045000	3048920	I'm just happy that I managed to get my hands on the Metal Gear Solid 4 limited edition
3048920	3049480	this week.
3049480	3050360	Ah, what'd you think?
3050360	3052120	I didn't even reserve the game either.
3052120	3052620	What's that?
3053400	3055800	I didn't even reserve the game either, and I found it.
3056760	3057960	I think they did a pretty good job.
3057960	3060920	They knew the demand was going to be pretty high for this, so they made a lot of copies
3060920	3061320	of it.
3061320	3062040	Well, what'd you think?
3062040	3063160	Surely you've opened it up by now.
3063160	3063660	What do you think?
3065960	3070040	Well, I've only had time to play about three hours of it so far, and it's pretty great.
3070040	3071400	It's really epic.
3072280	3073960	That's the only word you can describe it.
3074840	3078680	I think that's kind of the consensus around here at OLR Studios this evening.
3078680	3079480	The game is epic.
3080040	3081080	What makes it so epic?
3081080	3082520	Is it just the cutscenes epic?
3083800	3085320	What is it that makes the game so epic?
3086600	3091880	Well, I remember back when Hideo Kojima, he was all talking about how the
3091880	3097400	PS3 was the only system he wanted to be in because he wanted to be like a movie, basically.
3097400	3098120	And I don't know.
3098120	3099400	It kind of plays like a movie to me.
3101640	3106040	Here's my question, because you have the cutscenes, and we've heard a lot about the cutscenes,
3106040	3108520	and how they're very long, and how they're very epic.
3108520	3113000	How about the game itself, the actual game that you are playing?
3113000	3114600	I mean, is the game cool?
3116680	3118360	Well, what's it consider?
3118360	3119000	Is it like a...
3120440	3121560	What kind of game is it even consider?
3121560	3123480	It's like a strategy shooter or something like that?
3124360	3126840	A stealth action strategy game.
3126840	3127240	I don't know.
3128600	3129240	Okay.
3129240	3131160	Well, I don't know.
3131160	3132600	Usually the games are kind of like that.
3132600	3133160	Like, I don't know.
3133160	3136120	All I can think of is like Rainbow Six, maybe.
3136120	3138520	But I got bored with Rainbow Six.
3138520	3139400	This I didn't.
3139400	3141160	I'm very into it.
3142600	3148120	Is it because the story really draws you in in a way that maybe Rainbow Six doesn't really
3148120	3149560	have quite the same epic cutscenes?
3149560	3151320	That has to be it.
3152120	3153560	Rainbow Six, the story was...
3154760	3155880	I don't know, bored me.
3155880	3159240	As I was saying earlier in the show, Kojima has always been a bit of a storyteller, even
3159240	3160280	in the NES days.
3160280	3165320	I mean, the very, very first Metal Gear game that was on the NES, or really, MSX, if you
3165320	3171480	want to go that far back, kind of had depth and story that not a lot of games at that
3171480	3171960	time had.
3173160	3176600	Quelltippo in chat says it's tactical espionage action.
3176600	3177560	I forgot that.
3177560	3178840	It even says it right there on the box.
3178840	3180520	That would be the genre the game fits into.
3181560	3183000	Okay, that's what I thought it was.
3183000	3183480	There you go.
3183480	3183720	All right.
3184760	3185160	All right.
3185160	3186920	And there's no guard humping in this one.
3188120	3191000	Well, Asif or anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3192520	3194760	I got Mario Kart Wii, and I challenge you.
3195480	3196680	All right, we'll make it happen.
3196680	3197880	We'll have to set up a time.
3197880	3200120	I'll try to set up something in the forums this week, like a time.
3200120	3202520	Because Bobby Black Wolf wants to have a go at it, too.
3202520	3204760	So I'll try to set something up when we're both available.
3205880	3206360	All right.
3206360	3207000	All right.
3207000	3209000	We'll let you know.
3209000	3209480	Okay.
3209480	3209720	All right.
3209720	3210200	Later, buddy.
3211160	3211480	All right.
3211480	3211880	See you.
3211880	3212600	See you.
3212600	3212920	All right.
3212920	3215080	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3215080	3216520	Our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.
3216520	3217480	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
3217480	3217800	Who's this?
3219080	3221000	This is Spazzinator.
3221000	3221880	Hey, Spazzinator.
3221880	3222600	What's on your mind, buddy?
3223720	3228840	Well, I just want to kind of comment on two or three things, if I may.
3228840	3229340	Sure.
3229960	3230200	Yeah.
3230920	3235400	It's for your little rant about Nintendo earlier in Parday.
3235400	3235880	Uh-huh.
3235880	3238840	The only thing I'm going to say is right on.
3239800	3244280	In fact, I've been more or less boycotting up for the past 10 or 11 years.
3246760	3248920	I can't speak for everyone out there.
3248920	3255800	But personally, I feel that Nintendo really hasn't been pointing out anything for their
3255800	3256360	systems.
3256360	3262360	They've really been overly compelling, aside from maybe one or two titles for the past
3263160	3263960	couple systems.
3263960	3272600	And of course, Smash Brothers Brawl and whatnot notwithstanding.
3273240	3278120	But the last really truly system they really had was the Super Nintendo.
3279720	3288440	But granted, the N64 did have a few good games out there, like Goldeneye and whatnot.
3288440	3294280	But aside from that, ever since then, they've been going downhill ever since then.
3294280	3300120	You know, I've cooled off a little bit, since I got very hot-headed during Parday.
3300120	3306360	And I'm a little regretful that the actions of this guy at Nintendo of Europe kind of
3306360	3308840	hurts the company's image as a whole.
3308840	3315160	Right on down from the president, from Reggie Visa May, all the way down to the little people
3315160	3319800	that work at Nintendo that probably don't deserve a boycott or what have you.
3319800	3321800	But damn it, something has got to give.
3321800	3327400	And we have got to show that this guy is made of suck for making this statement.
3329640	3332600	Something beyond just a little apology needs to happen.
3333400	3334280	Because here's the thing.
3334280	3338280	And the reason why I said as part of my boycott that if Nintendo addresses it, I would be
3338280	3339320	OK with it.
3339320	3344600	And I would end my boycott is because if Nintendo were to address it, it would invalidate
3344600	3347400	everything this guy said about it being for geeks and otaku.
3347400	3348680	And this guy would look like a moron.
3351640	3357800	That's part of the reason why I said that I will forgive and forget if Nintendo will
3357800	3360360	say, look, we are going to do something about it.
3360360	3362200	And it's not just for geeks and otaku.
3363320	3373080	Yeah, well, that guy's comments kind of factors into my opinion that over the past few years,
3373080	3379480	you know, Nintendo has been getting like what I guess could be termed as like an overinflated
3379480	3380040	ego.
3380040	3385080	You know, they've been kind of like, I don't know if you want to call it ruffians or laurels
3385080	3387000	or whatever or things then.
3387000	3393720	But that's definitely prevalent on all sides of Nintendo.
3393720	3394120	Hold up.
3394120	3398360	Since Super Nintendo, you know, after Super Nintendo, Nintendo did not exactly enjoy world
3398360	3401400	success with the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube.
3401400	3405480	Granted, those systems weren't failure per se, but they weren't number one.
3405480	3406120	It doesn't matter.
3406120	3407960	They still think they're fucking cocky.
3407960	3410520	And we see it on the retail side.
3410520	3413720	We see it also on consumer side.
3415160	3419720	Unfortunately, it's just, you know, I don't know their mentality.
3419720	3425400	They have they control their market with the releasing of their systems and stuff like
3425400	3426040	that.
3426040	3430280	I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of shortage going around that's intentional.
3430280	3434840	I mean, I don't know, but, you know, at the same time, they're doing this stuff, you know,
3434840	3442760	with suing third party, you know, peripheral manufacturers and, you know, this stuff.
3442760	3446440	They all they have a schedule of how they're going to release this stuff and they're going
3446440	3449320	to slowly roll out stuff to keep people interested.
3449320	3450840	It's just like, you know, Wii Fit and stuff.
3450840	3456200	The Wii console people finally have it now and they're just like, hmm, how can we get
3456200	3458760	people interested in this console again like they were at launch?
3458760	3459240	Oh, I know.
3459240	3462360	Let's release Wii Fit now and make that fucking hard to find.
3462360	3463240	There you go.
3463240	3465640	And now it's, you know, all coming around again.
3465640	3468040	And watch when Wii Sports 2 comes out.
3468040	3469160	Here we go again.
3469160	3471640	It's just going to be, you know, a constant cycle.
3471640	3475720	They're going to slowly roll out stuff that they should have rolled out at launch throughout
3475720	3477560	the lifetime of this console.
3477560	3483000	Somebody needs to tell Nintendo, I made you and I can break you just as easily.
3483000	3487320	So much to tell Nintendo that people are going to stop waiting for stuff to happen and they're
3487320	3487960	going to move on.
3487960	3492760	Because they may buy your console, but they're not going to buy any of your games or buy
3492760	3494440	your virtual console stuff.
3494440	3498760	I mean, sure, they've made a little bit of money off of people from buying the console.
3498760	3502280	I can't imagine that they're making a ton of money on each console sales.
3502280	3508680	But, you know, if people are just staying there and playing Wii Sports and then say,
3508680	3514120	ah, forget this online stuff, it's not happening and I can't, you know, find space to save
3514120	3516280	my games and stuff and have to re-download them later.
3516280	3521560	And people are just going to get confused and get overwhelmed by it and they're just
3521560	3522280	going to say, forget it.
3522280	3524040	I don't want to, I'm not going to do that.
3524760	3529320	And it sucks because the people that are actually supporting them and utilizing this stuff,
3529320	3531640	they're just saying, ah, you're not important.
3533480	3534600	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3534600	3538840	Don't get me wrong, you know, at least way back in the day, I used to be a really big
3538840	3540360	Nintendo fanboy and whatnot.
3540360	3546760	But, you know, once I started realizing that, you know, starting with N64, you know, relatively
3546760	3551880	few games were coming out that I was particularly interested in, I kind of started, you know,
3551880	3555080	fully, partially moving over to the Sony camp.
3555080	3561880	And I've been with Sony now for, you know, ever since, like, roughly when Final Fantasy
3561880	3562840	VII came out.
3564840	3568920	Here's the thing, and, you know, in reference to kind of like what I said and stuff, is
3568920	3573720	that, you know, I'm a Nintendo fanboy too, and this is what kind of stinks about the
3573720	3578520	whole thing is that, you know, I've been so supportive of the Nintendo Wii and I've spent
3578520	3586200	a lot, a lot of money on those virtual console downloads to kind of have this happen, sucks.
3586200	3590120	So it's not about what, and if you're thinking I'm overreacting just because I was called
3590120	3592840	the geek, you're not really hearing what I'm saying.
3592840	3599160	I'm saying that why would Nintendo dismiss the people that have been supporting them
3599160	3599880	like this?
3599880	3601800	That's what sucks about it.
3603320	3610200	So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I kind of, you know, you know, felt the same way, you know,
3610200	3616200	when, you know, you know, going years back, not because, you know, they make comments,
3616200	3621800	you know, you know, but because they weren't really keeping up with the times and they
3621800	3627480	weren't, you know, their games weren't really going up with the people that have been supporting
3627480	3629080	them since way back when, you know.
3630520	3638200	Obviously, you know, the people that grew up with the original NES or SNES, eventually
3638200	3643400	their, you know, taste and games were going to change and, you know, their selection of
3643400	3647240	games, you know, didn't really change with the times, you know.
3648760	3651480	All right, Spaznator, we've got to let you go so we can get to at least one more call,
3651480	3653960	but thank you so much for your call and take care, okay?
3654600	3655320	All right, you too.
3655320	3655880	All right, bye-bye.
3657640	3659640	All right, one more call.
3659640	3661240	Boy, we didn't even have to wait.
3661240	3662840	They're just calling in back to back tonight.
3662840	3663640	I feel popular.
3663640	3664760	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
3664760	3665080	Who's this?
3666280	3667480	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
3667480	3668680	Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?
3669560	3670760	Oh, a lot of things.
3670760	3671400	So what's this?
3671400	3671880	Wait, wait, wait.
3671880	3674440	First thing I want to ask, you're coming out here in like two weeks, right?
3675000	3675480	Yes.
3675480	3678840	Okay, and you said something about you're going to fix our Justin TV cam when you're
3678840	3679340	here?
3680040	3681080	I'm going to do my best.
3681080	3682760	I am very technically inclined.
3682760	3684440	All right, Loki thinks he can do it, too.
3684440	3687480	So between the two of y'all, I think we're going to have a high-tech studio by the time
3687480	3689160	the 4th of July rolls around.
3689160	3692120	All right, you can talk about whatever you want to do now, sorry.
3693160	3693960	Kill, kill.
3693960	3694680	Couple of things.
3694680	3698760	Ask for the guy from Nintendo of Europe by this comment, am I the only one that doesn't
3698760	3700280	give two shits about what the hell he said?
3702680	3703880	Well, here's the thing.
3703880	3705080	I don't care.
3705080	3706760	Look, I get called a geek.
3706760	3708840	I say thanks, you know?
3708840	3713000	I don't, being a geek is not a bad thing, but it's the fact that he was, and I think
3713000	3717000	Jamie kind of referenced this, he was using these things as a derogatory thing.
3717000	3720760	So he's basically saying, well, we're not going to put something out because we don't
3720760	3722600	really care about the people who want this.
3722600	3727400	And it's kind of like, well, F you, because if I've spent $100 on all these different
3727400	3732760	virtual console games I filled up and I was planning on spending even more, then if I'm
3732760	3735720	just boo-boo to you, then forget it.
3735720	3736920	I'm not going to spend any more money.
3736920	3745960	Well, the proper thing to say would have been, Nintendo understands that this is definitely
3745960	3750840	a problem and we are addressing it and we are working towards fixing said problem.
3750840	3756520	Or just say, he could have just said, unfortunately, at this time, Nintendo has no fix for this.
3756520	3760040	He could have given the same BS, the same line we've heard from Nintendo time and time
3760040	3760440	again.
3760440	3765080	Unfortunately, at this time, folks will have to delete the game and they can always re-download
3765080	3765880	it for free.
3765880	3768120	He could have given that same line and I wouldn't have cared.
3768120	3771480	I would have still thought Nintendo probably needs to address their storage issue at some
3771480	3773880	point, but I wouldn't have cared.
3773880	3778760	But the fact that he had to be so standoffish about it just sucks.
3778760	3783400	And why would you put someone like that in as your freaking VP of marketing?
3784840	3787160	I mean, that's the part that appalls me.
3787160	3788200	So they promote with him.
3789240	3790360	Well, that's what it sounds like.
3791240	3791480	Right.
3791480	3795080	And Game Guru says, and Awada actually did say that, Rob, and I have nothing but nice
3795080	3796840	things to say about Awada.
3796840	3799000	I have nothing but I am a Nintendo fan boy.
3799000	3803480	The man's done a lot and I'm fine with that line because I understand they're dancing
3803480	3807080	around the fact that their system has limitations and that's the PC thing to say.
3807080	3811640	But for this guy to come out with guns ablaze and is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, you
3811640	3812600	want to pick a fight?
3812600	3813480	You want to pick a fight?
3814440	3815960	Sounds like the guy was PMSing.
3816680	3817320	Seriously.
3818040	3818520	Yes.
3818520	3820280	I've had no more Nintendo talk.
3820280	3821960	Seriously, I'm done with it.
3821960	3823160	So what else is on your mind?
3823160	3827400	I remember growing up that arcades were the shit.
3827400	3832600	I remember growing up, my aunt would take me to this space called Nathan's.
3832600	3833640	You go inside.
3833640	3835320	It was like heaven.
3835320	3839160	Hunt is like 50, 60 different kinds of arcades you can play.
3839160	3843080	And that's why I first got my hands on Final Fight and fell in love with Capcom right there.
3845480	3849800	And nowadays it's like you go into like a little rinky dink sports center where they
3849800	3856040	have hockey, ice skating, you go upstairs as a concession stand, you go around the corner,
3856040	3858920	there's three arcade machines and a bootleg Cuzar.
3859720	3865080	The place I remember was a little place called Nickel Mania where you would pay $2.50 to
3865080	3867000	get in and then all the games ran on nickels.
3867560	3868280	It was awesome.
3868280	3870360	That's like the first place I ever played Mortal Combat.
3871320	3872040	That's cool.
3872040	3873960	Sadly, it's no more.
3875160	3875880	You know what?
3875880	3878520	When you make your visit out here.
3878520	3881480	Yeah, we're going to have to.
3881480	3886440	We're going to have to take you to Roseville Golf Land because that's really one of the
3886440	3891880	last actual arcades that I'm glad you didn't throwing good in there.
3892840	3894600	It's it's what we got.
3894600	3896040	I think that's I think that's a good way to pray.
3896040	3896600	It's what we got.
3896600	3899080	I went to Scandi and he said that it's just completely.
3899080	3899880	Yes, yeah.
3900680	3904440	Well, Scandi and Scandi is just confused on what it's trying to be anyways.
3904440	3909080	But, you know, we might have to we have to actually might have to take a trip to Milpitas
3909080	3912840	Golf Land because that one's still fairly decent.
3912840	3915800	Yeah, Milpitas and Sunnyvale are still OK, even.
3915800	3919320	But you notice it's Sunnyvale also has the test machines, though.
3919320	3922600	But slowly that stuff's been going out and Flaming Fingers been coming in.
3922600	3925320	Not that Flaming Fingers a bad thing, but too much of it is.
3925880	3928760	What about the jump rope game again?
3928760	3932120	Something we're going to have to go also go to John's incredibly mediocre pizza.
3932120	3934680	Oh, we do need to go to John's incredibly shitty pizza.
3934680	3937000	You haven't still haven't sent me a certain email, sir.
3938440	3938940	I did.
3939480	3941080	You did it just now.
3941080	3941580	OK.
3942280	3944280	No, like earlier last week.
3944280	3945480	But God damn it.
3945480	3947800	Y'all make me want to hop on a plane to come tonight.
3948600	3953080	The problem is that your airline is trying to make me sign up for some mailing list so
3953080	3954920	that I can actually see the email.
3954920	3956520	So I just need a copy paste.
3957480	3958120	No problem.
3958120	3959320	I'll resend it out.
3959320	3959960	Thank you.
3959960	3962120	All right, Rama, quickly, anything else before we end the show?
3963640	3964440	No, that's it.
3965400	3965800	All right.
3965800	3966440	Take care, buddy.
3967000	3967560	You too.
3967560	3968520	Bye bye.
3968520	3969020	Bye.
3970360	3972840	Rob D says too much of the Flaming Finger is a bad thing.
3973640	3975160	Let me clarify my statement.
3975160	3978440	Too much of the Flaming Finger requires soothing action.
3978440	3981640	There's nothing wrong with a little Flaming Finger here and there.
3981640	3986280	But you don't want to OD on Flaming Finger.
3986280	3988760	You need to mix it up a little bit.
3989880	3990680	All right, forget it.
3991400	3992760	That's going to do it for phone calls tonight.
3992760	3993800	Thank you guys for calling in.
3993800	3994920	If you didn't get through, so sorry.
3994920	3996600	But send us an email or try again next week.
3997480	3998840	Or you can always leave a voicemail.
3998840	3999320	We'll catch up.
3999320	4000840	I've got voicemails we got to play.
4000840	4002600	We'll try to catch up on those in a future week.
4002600	4004280	For now, we got to wrap it up.
4005080	4008360	But not until we do some last minute stories of which I'm sure Loki has some.
4008360	4008860	Loki?
4009400	4013080	Yeah, I've just been going over the stuff that we didn't talk about.
4013080	4016840	Part of the big leak list that we talked about in part A.
4016840	4017640	Here's another game.
4017640	4018680	I don't know what it's called.
4018680	4024040	But it's basically Dr. Octopus and Magneto have joined forces to create the most dangerous
4024040	4025560	alliance in the world ever known.
4026600	4030920	And Spider-Man must team up with the X-Men to stop them.
4031960	4038040	Choose two heroes to fight side by side across multiple levels spanning the globe from Manhattan
4038040	4039400	to the Savage Lands.
4039400	4045720	Pick Spidey or one of the dozen X-Men such as Wolverine, Cyclops, or Storm where it pays
4045720	4050440	off to select different characters depending on the enemies you face or unique game environments
4050440	4051240	you are in.
4051240	4053800	Earn upgrades for each character you use.
4053800	4056600	Experience unique combos specific to tube.
4056600	4061000	Are they just reusing the Marvel Ultimate Alliance engine like over and over and over
4061000	4061320	again?
4061320	4062200	I mean seriously.
4062200	4064120	Or I should say X-Men Legends engine.
4065640	4066120	All right.
4066120	4069720	Anyways, let's see what else here.
4072120	4080840	We've got some more stuff coming from this big leak list here including...
4084200	4085480	Oh, we talked about all this stuff.
4085480	4087240	They have the Mensa workout.
4087240	4089480	I guess it's gonna be another brain training game for the Wii.
4090600	4095320	And I don't know how Extreme Makeover Home Edition is gonna be any fun.
4095320	4095720	We'll see.
4097640	4101480	There was a game I had on the Commodore 64 called like Dream House or something like
4101480	4105320	that and pretty much all you did is you went through the house and you could paint all
4105320	4108840	the like you could paint the ceiling and the walls a different color one of 16 colors because
4108840	4112680	you know Commodore 64 was cutting edge and then you could put furniture in the house
4112680	4113320	too.
4113320	4116760	And but you were only limited to like eight pieces of furniture in a room because you
4116760	4118760	know there's all those limitations on the 64.
4118760	4123240	I hope that God was like half these games are fake or not really fake but just like
4123240	4127240	concepts that are never gonna come to you know in the past because if that's the case
4127240	4130520	there's gonna be like 20 Spider-Man games coming out between now and like probably a
4130520	4131800	couple years from now.
4131800	4136920	Including Spider-Man Agile Warrior where it lets players control Spider or Spider-Man
4136920	4138760	with the Wii balance board.
4138760	4143000	There's Spider-Man Hero Evolved for the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.
4143000	4148440	Replay as the son of Spider-Man in 2064 using spider powers and future check to battle
4148440	4148920	villains.
4148920	4152920	There's Spider-Man New Heights for the 360, PS3, and the Wii.
4152920	4159000	Upgrade Spidey's abilities as he moves from battling low-level gangs to famous foes in
4159000	4160200	the New York skyline.
4161800	4163240	Spider-Man Gangs of New York.
4164120	4169720	Okay seriously uh gangs take over the whole city and Spider-Man must pit them against
4169720	4170200	each other.
4172920	4174760	Spider-Man Adaption.
4174760	4179720	Spidey travels all over the globe from Tokyo to Paris to Moscow to take out foes.
4179720	4180440	Marvel Team-Up.
4180440	4181640	Spider-Man meets X-Men.
4181640	4183720	I think that was the one that I was talking about earlier.
4183720	4187160	Spider-Man Contest of Champions 360, PS3, and Wii.
4187160	4193000	Destructible fighter for two to four players with Spider-Man, Venom, Wolverine, Electro,
4193000	4196120	Doc Oc, Carnage, and the Green Goblin.
4196120	4199080	Spider-Man Mass Evolution for all three systems.
4199080	4205800	Spidey skills from strength to speed to Spidey sense are upgradable as you play.
4205800	4209160	Spider-Man Chaos for all three systems.
4209160	4215000	Spidey has eight hours of frenetic action to save the safe from certain doom.
4215720	4219720	Spider-Man Tactics, a stealthy and strategic Spidey game.
4219720	4224760	Spider-Man Vision, first and third person gameplay Spidey style.
4224760	4228760	Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies.
4228760	4234680	Spider-Man Webmaster for the Wii, a web shooting game for a third person action.
4235400	4241960	Spider-Man Web Slinger, use precision web aiming to target enemies building or build
4241960	4244040	web slingshots and snipe enemies.
4246200	4250840	I think some of those are all like ideas but aren't going to come out because that'd be
4250840	4252040	way too much.
4252040	4258040	The avatars, one of the things that people noticed, there were some licensed things with
4258040	4261320	them as well so maybe some licensed clothing stuff you'll be able to get it because they
4261320	4263800	had one of them with an Incredibles t-shirt.
4264840	4265560	Sounds kind of neat.
4267960	4268840	Let's see here.
4271160	4273720	Oh, Ultimate Band.
4273720	4279240	They're going to be doing an Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 version apparently of the game
4279240	4285080	and it will be to, I'm sure, Rob's enjoyment, compatible with Rock Band instruments.
4285080	4285800	Thank God.
4286840	4289800	And the Wii U version, of course, does not have instruments at all.
4289800	4293240	And it's actually got a video out there for it too on how you play.
4293240	4294200	It's kind of interesting.
4296760	4297560	Let's see here.
4298520	4305080	Then there was also one of the things was the SBGs, which is server-based gaming, and
4305080	4310600	apparently it's going to be like a social networking blade or something like that that
4310600	4316680	allow you to play games from game shows like Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and
4316680	4317560	other things like that.
4318120	4319720	So that's kind of interesting.
4321400	4328280	And finally, Powers and Titans, which is a multiplayer superhero game that's apparently
4328280	4333160	going to be something that Joss Whedon is going to be a part of.
4333160	4333800	Woohoo!
4333800	4339240	So I don't know what exactly that is, but probably some sort of superhero game.
4339240	4340280	Actually, I'm mad at him.
4340920	4341320	Why?
4341320	4341720	Why?
4341720	4343240	For the end of Astonishing X-Men.
4345080	4345960	Okay.
4345960	4346920	I think you'll get over it.
4348200	4348600	Oh, no.
4348600	4349080	You don't.
4349080	4349400	That.
4349400	4349900	No.
4350840	4360920	And finally, in unrelated news, you may remember the Wii Fit girl who's been kind of floating
4360920	4364680	around, she had the YouTube video where she shook her ass while playing Wii Fit.
4364680	4365000	Yes.
4365000	4372120	Well, Playboy's Joe Garcia has put out her own videos that are a little bit more seductive,
4372120	4374200	also her playing Wii Fit as well.
4374200	4375240	Trying to cash in on that.
4375240	4375560	Nice.
4377080	4380760	Well, you know we've moved into a new generation where people are trying to cash in on other
4380760	4382120	people's YouTube videos.
4382120	4382760	It's amazing.
4383880	4385080	Absolutely amazing.
4385080	4391400	Yeah, so all right, awesome, and it'll be interesting.
4391400	4393400	Logie will review those videos next week on the show.
4394760	4395880	I don't know if there's...
4395880	4397480	Well, it didn't look that interesting.
4397480	4399400	I mean, she didn't look that interesting.
4399400	4401080	She doesn't get naked, okay?
4401080	4405240	I mean, this is a Playboy little pictorial thing that she does not get naked.
4405240	4406680	I do not approve of that.
4406680	4407180	Fine.
4407560	4411960	But I do approve of people, you know, taking it to the next step.
4411960	4412460	All right.
4412460	4417340	To which I say, Wii Fit girl, you're a rebuttal.
4419420	4422940	If that's going to do it for our last minute stories tonight, I guess we're going to go
4422940	4426700	ahead and wrap up the show and bring another week of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
4426700	4431740	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, our sixth anniversary show, if you can believe it.
4432540	4433740	But nothing too special going on.
4433740	4434780	Same old shit we always do.
4435340	4435980	Hopefully some guests.
4435980	4436540	I know...
4436540	4438220	No one's made any suggestions.
4438220	4439900	Mieglatov will be here next week.
4439900	4441100	I should get my husband here.
4441100	4442380	So we'll at least have him.
4442380	4445820	I was trying, by the way, I was trying to get one story we didn't get to tonight.
4445820	4446700	I don't know if you read this.
4447500	4451900	Did you read on the gaming blogs this week about that lady who's running for state senate
4451900	4456940	in Connecticut and how it's like this big deal, like, oh, politicians getting into games
4456940	4459180	because she has a level 70 in World of Warcraft.
4459740	4460780	Did you see that story?
4460780	4462300	Yeah, I think it was last week.
4462300	4463100	Wasn't it fun?
4463100	4466620	I don't know if you thought of this, but didn't like the minute I read that, I'm like, what's
4466620	4467740	the big freaking deal?
4467740	4473340	Like my boyfriend ran for state senate in 2006 and he has two level 70s in Warcraft.
4473900	4477100	I was actually trying to get him to come to the show tonight, but he didn't want to.
4477740	4478140	He didn't.
4478140	4479340	I don't know what he'd say.
4480060	4481580	He was like, I don't know if I come up.
4481580	4483340	He's like, what would I talk about if I went on your show?
4483340	4485820	I'm like, you play more World of Warcraft than I do.
4485820	4486380	You'd fit in.
4486380	4491420	Whenever you see a story like that, you just have to think of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.
4491420	4491980	I'm hip.
4491980	4492460	I'm cool.
4492460	4499260	Yeah, but I'm just saying, you know what?
4499260	4502620	Politicians come in all different flavors, just like regular.
4502620	4506460	Why does it matter what your job is and what you like to do in your spare time?
4506460	4512060	For who the hell cares and what relevance does your gaming life have on your political
4512060	4512540	views?
4512540	4514460	Well, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
4514460	4515020	To be fair.
4515740	4519660	The reason why I think it was going around is because, you know, there's been a lot of
4519660	4523340	negative political, like, you know, all these politicians are trying to ban games.
4523340	4527900	All these politicians are, you know, putting into place these, you know, that, you know,
4527900	4531420	all these violent video games are going to be banned or games are like porn and all this
4531420	4531660	stuff.
4531660	4535100	So it was a little refreshing to hear of a politician who's like, yeah, I play World
4535100	4535740	of Warcraft.
4535740	4539340	So well, I was just thinking she's not the first.
4540460	4545740	But I just don't see what, you know, what you like to do as a hobby unless, you know,
4545740	4551100	you like to, you know, skin kittens in your backyard or something as a hobby.
4551100	4553500	No, you know, but you play, you play video game.
4554140	4555100	What's the problem?
4555100	4555980	Who cares?
4555980	4556380	I don't know.
4556380	4561420	You know why it's like, you know, I don't care what people's bedroom habits are.
4561420	4562940	I don't care what their gaming habits are.
4563500	4568300	You know, as long as they're not hurting anybody, what does it matter?
4568300	4569500	Right, right.
4571180	4573500	And people piss me off.
4573500	4578140	By the way, speaking of not caring about what goes on behind closed doors, I do want
4578140	4584780	to say, though, a very happy day tomorrow, Monday, June 15th and going on into June 16th
4585340	4590700	to all the new couples who will be getting married in California who finally, finally
4591340	4592140	have a quality.
4593260	4595020	It's it's it's so amazing.
4595020	4597420	I'm so happy to live in a state where that's going to only overrule it again.
4598060	4598620	You know what?
4599420	4600940	Not if I have anything to say about it.
4600940	4609180	Well, did you did you hear from Amanda about no capital open up now?
4609980	4611420	Did that actually happen?
4611420	4612380	I saw the website.
4612380	4614700	I know the friend was talking about opening one in the Castro.
4614700	4615580	Did that actually happen?
4615580	4616380	I think so.
4616380	4617260	Oh, my God.
4617980	4618860	We'll have to get a link from her.
4619500	4619900	Wow.
4619900	4621660	That's great if that actually happened, huh?
4621660	4622380	But you know what?
4622380	4627100	I honestly think that, you know, eventually and I think that more and more people are
4627100	4629820	realizing this, that what does it matter?
4629820	4633580	I mean, and personally, and I've had this discussion with other people before, I actually
4633580	4638620	think that marriage should not be a government institution.
4638620	4639180	You know what I mean?
4639180	4641820	Well, thankfully, and boy, we got off topic of video games.
4641820	4642460	That's all right.
4642460	4642780	They know.
4642780	4643500	That's all right.
4643500	4645260	Thankfully, it's a topic that's important to me.
4645260	4645740	So you know what?
4645740	4646240	Deal.
4647900	4653180	Thankfully, the youth of America does not have their head up their ass in this regard.
4653180	4654780	The majority in this regard.
4654780	4655500	Yeah, the majority.
4656060	4657980	And I still know it makes me very.
4657980	4660940	Yeah, there's always going to be somebody with their head up their ass, but it makes
4660940	4662380	me very hopeful for the future.
4662380	4664140	Yeah, very hopeful for the future.
4664140	4664940	All right.
4664940	4666140	I was going to say one thing.
4666140	4666540	I'm sorry.
4666540	4667660	I missed one last thing.
4668300	4668800	Yeah.
4669340	4670220	Confident.
4670220	4673020	This is actually coming from our friends over at Bawani Style.
4673660	4681180	Apparently, there was an MTV pack or an advertisement for rock band that they were showing a bunch
4681180	4683820	of songs kind of scrolling through the song list.
4683820	4687100	And lo and behold, there's a bunch of songs that haven't come out yet in there.
4687100	4691260	So four songs that they spotted on there.
4691260	4696860	The Aesthetics of Hate by Machine Head, Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, which I believe is coming
4696860	4703020	out this next week, Breed by Nirvana, and Burn by Nine Inch Nails.
4703820	4704320	Sweet.
4704940	4705580	Sounds like fun.
4706780	4711260	And I was going to say, I think there's a couple other stories that they had, too.
4711260	4715260	There was something about like new DDR or something like that.
4715260	4720620	It was a DDR fitness thing.
4720620	4725100	They had some details on Konami's website and stuff.
4725100	4733260	And then there's also some new rhythm game that's coming to the Xbox 360 that I don't
4733260	4735580	know what it really is yet.
4735580	4740220	Probably something that they're going to be announcing maybe at E3 or something like that.
4740220	4743180	Beat and Groovy, as it was called.
4743180	4747180	It's an E-rated Konami published title.
4747180	4751900	It says, from the sound of it, sounds like Konami's rhythm game, of course.
4751900	4758220	And it was found on the Australia's ratings board webpage.
4759180	4766300	And there is also another Xbox 360 titled Domino Master, which is supposed to be coming
4766300	4768380	to Xbox Live Arcade.
4768380	4773660	Wonder if that's Mr. Domino, because that'd be funny.
4773660	4774220	All right.
4774220	4782060	Now that we've had the last, last, last minute stories, let's go ahead and wrap up the show.
4783100	4784700	We got all the final thoughts.
4784700	4786380	We got the last, last minute story.
4786380	4790060	And you know Ultimate Band has Miley Cyrus in it, because it's a Disney title.
4790780	4791340	Oh my God.
4791340	4791980	So I was right.
4791980	4793020	It has Hannah Montana in it.
4794540	4795580	I have ESPN.
4795580	4799420	Isn't Dolly Parton our godmother?
4800140	4801100	I think so.
4801100	4801900	That's cool.
4801900	4802140	Yeah.
4802140	4803420	I like Dolly Parton.
4803420	4805500	I don't like Hannah Montana, but I like Dolly Parton.
4805500	4805740	All right.
4805740	4805980	All right.
4805980	4809900	Before we get out of here tonight, we have one more thing we wanted to play for you guys.
4809900	4811660	It came up in the email earlier.
4811660	4814940	It was what Katamari's Forever emailed us, right?
4814940	4822540	And sent us the parody of Still Alive, but it's featuring the OLR themed lyrics.
4822540	4823020	Yes.
4823020	4825900	So we're actually going to play that for the listeners before we sign off tonight.
4825900	4826860	So here it is.
4826860	4828700	And then we're going to be out of here.
4828700	4833100	So big thanks to Katamari's Forever and all the fans who got together to make the lyrics.
4833100	4833820	I can't wait to hear this.
4833820	4856540	Here you go.
4923820	4944540	Yes.
4954060	4956540	But is it a stereo?
4958300	4959820	That was a joke.
4959820	4960780	Haha.
4960780	4961340	No, no.
4963340	4968780	Jamie's eating a scummy, but then again it's lucky.
4968780	4972300	Look at us still singing with this used to be.
4972300	4976860	Told me I tore the heart, but inside here it's so clear.
4976860	4978780	Let this keep on the light.
4978780	4984700	Oh, OLR Sunday nights, it's Pacific night and we still have time.
4984700	4988460	And believe me, no 365.
4988460	4992460	I'm doing podcasts without 365.
4992460	4996460	We're here on August, not 365.
4996460	5000460	And while you're dying, we'll know it's 365.
5000460	5004460	Podcasts of the year we all gonna strive.
5004460	5006460	Gonna strive.
5006460	5008700	Gonna strive.
5008700	5011660	Yay, nice job Katamari's Forever.
5011660	5012300	That was very cool.
5012300	5015420	It was a little hard to hear the voice, but that's okay.
5015420	5018140	I think on headphones, it'll come out a lot better.
5018140	5024060	I think it'll be easier to hear on headphones, but nice job and very, very flattering, nevertheless.
5024060	5026380	So thank you very much for that.
5026380	5028460	And thank you to everybody who is involved with that.
5028460	5031340	Okay, now I think we can end the show.
5031340	5035020	So thank you very much for supporting independent podcasting as you always do.
5035020	5039740	Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program and help
5039740	5043660	spread the word because that's, you know, we don't have any big magazine or website backing
5043660	5043820	us.
5043820	5046300	So we rely on word of mouth to get the word out.
5046300	5048300	We do this for free because we heart you.
5048300	5050940	So we'll see you next week for our sixth anniversary show.
5050940	5052140	That's going to do it for another OLR.
5052140	5053020	Good night.
