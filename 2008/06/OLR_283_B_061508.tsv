449	5514	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5874	14721	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15422	19065	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19554	29237	And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio here on All Games Radio where we broadcast live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time immediately following the Bobby Blackwolf show.
29277	32778	So sometimes it's a couple minutes early, sometimes it's a couple minutes late as it was tonight.
33138	36939	But that's alright because we have some great shows that we play with here on All Games Radio.
36979	42140	Not just Bobby on Sunday nights but a whole sort of assortment of different podcasts and other live shows that air throughout the week.
42521	44161	So if you haven't checked it out yet you definitely should.
44361	47002	www.allgames.com Meanwhile
47662	50423	We've got some other gaming news to get into, and we're going to get into that in just a minute.
50443	60766	But we've got to follow up with some of that hilarity from the Part A. Or I guess I shouldn't say hilarity, because somebody is going to get yelled at over all those game news things getting leaked out.
61447	63787	Loki, you were doing some poking around on the website.
63807	65388	What kind of stuff were you looking at there during the break?
65508	68869	Well, I was just trying to pull up a bunch of... What's the name of these guys again?
70069	71050	Intellisponse?
71090	71950	Okay, Intellisponse.
73111	83816	I thought it was funny though because there was a section on the NeoGAF forum that someone had highlighted their privacy policy.
84437	85957	It's all the policy.
86077	89319	Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority.
89719	92521	We have taken careful measures to secure your information.
95478	100521	We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from PC to our servers.
101062	107966	Our secure server software encrypts information, ensuring that all internet transactions remain private.
108606	110027	That's got to be so embarrassing, though.
110347	111327	That's got to be so embarrassing.
111347	112268	That's so stupid.
112768	117351	Yeah, it is secure, and it will prompt for a password and stuff like that.
119232	122535	But, if you remove part of the URL on that, it won't.
123376	126018	So, it's broken.
128040	129401	Yeah, somebody's going to get screamed at.
129921	132103	Lots of stuff, and we'll talk about it a little bit more later on.
132223	135767	I'd be curious to see if this company makes a statement, or if they just try to pretend it didn't happen.
135927	140651	I think they're just going to pretend it didn't happen, and let Microsoft and Activision kind of
141011	144614	And all the other marketing research companies today are going, Woohoo!
144694	146275	New business is going to be coming soon.
146595	146796	Yeah.
146856	147096	All right.
147456	151419	Let's stop kicking sand in these guys' faces and go back to gaming news.
151940	152160	Yes.
153121	153401	All right.
155202	158465	So there's some interesting things coming out this week in Japan.
158505	166091	I don't really know what you'd call this press event, but it was basically the event where Microsoft says, Hey, look at all the Japanese RPGs that are coming our way.
166751	166951	So...
168658	169619	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
191482	198385	I guess apparently the game was announced back in 2007 at the Square Enix party.
198525	201046	But, you know, I don't know.
201506	204607	And it was funny too because originally it was supposed to be a PS3 exclusive.
205727	209869	But no word yet on when it's going to arrive on the PS3 or if it will.
212284	214004	Tales of Vesperia Tales of Vesperia
237771	238332	Is it coming out of the U.S.
238352	239033	at the same time?
239133	239835	Around the same time.
239915	241377	Around the same time, but we don't have it.
241397	242479	It'll also be mid-August.
243220	243681	Is it really?
243901	244442	Yeah.
244562	244983	So far.
245103	246685	That wasn't part of this press release.
246705	247667	Do you know something I don't?
248768	250089	I know that's coming out mid-August.
251350	253672	I don't remember the exact date, but it's coming out mid-August.
253772	254913	It still looks pretty cool.
254953	259456	It's a Namco Bandai RPG, which I believe Eternal Sonata was by them as well.
259537	264440	That game was kind of one of those games that slipped under some people's radars, but it's great.
265021	265801	It's a great game.
266161	268223	So I'm hoping this game follows in that.
268263	269664	It's going to be 37,800 yen for the bundle.
274147	282769	because the game is actually going to get its own Xbox 360 bundle over in Japan to try and tap into that market that just won't pick up on Xbox 360.
282869	292991	The Japanese are really resistant to Xbox 360, but trying to use some of these upcoming role-playing games, which all look pretty rad, to try and woo some of the Japanese players over to Xbox 360.
293411	295131	It hasn't worked so far.
295652	299652	And I have a feeling they're all too busy playing Metal Gear Solid 4 to care this week.
299772	300353	Sorry to say.
300373	301333	But I'll buy it.
305083	332846	Another game that Squenix published is actually developed by TriAce for Xbox 360 Infinite Undiscovery has ship dates for North America and Europe being 9.2 and 9.5 respectively and proposed in-store dates of September 11th for Japan and Asia You can read about it if you read Japanese on Famitsu
334110	338532	By the way, this was like my favorite out of all those role-playing games I saw, this Infinite Undiscovery.
338612	339413	This was pretty sweet.
341194	342755	The name is very interesting.
343015	345616	It's really weird that we're getting it before Japan.
346116	347277	It's shipping on that day.
347657	350219	It's still going to be there the next day.
350359	359704	I'll still be able to walk into a store and get it before a Japanese listener or person, which is strange, because with role-playing games, I can't think of many times that happens.
359964	360084	Hmm.
360504	362565	So, but that's, I mean, it's not that much.
362645	363305	It's only like a week.
363585	367367	But I think it's pretty cool they at least obviously developed the games at the same time.
367787	367987	Yes.
368408	368768	Pretty neat.
369208	376011	And then the last game, of course, which we've seen a little bit of trailers on, I think during E3, and maybe the Tokyo Game Show, I don't remember.
376451	382074	But the last title, of course, The Last Remnant, will be getting an Xbox 360 release.
382854	386416	This is the one that's using the Unreal 3 engine that I'm...
387583	388483	was first announced in 2007.
388843	403948	And the game is supposed to be, I guess, supposed to be launching simultaneously on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan, North America, and Europe, I guess, a little bit later.
404048	411890	But now it looks like they're going to get a simultaneous worldwide launch in all three territories.
412010	414231	So it's supposed to come sometime this winter.
416969	417390	Interesting.
417450	420775	So coming soon is basically what they've said.
420795	421035	The fall.
422414	427077	Hey, I'm actually curious, because I know a lot of our listeners are into these RPG-type games, because we are.
427437	443146	I'm kind of curious, chat room, out of these games we just talked about, Star Ocean, Tales of Vesperia, Infinite Undiscovery, Last Remnant, is there any that, and kind of including other RPGs we know are in the tailpipe for Xbox 360, such as Blue Dragon 2, I think's been confirmed, as well as the Lost Odyssey sequel.
443586	448509	I'm kind of curious, those of you guys in chat, are any of these catching your interest?
449497	453059	And if so, which one and why?
453139	455801	Which one do you think you're more interested in over the others?
455901	459022	I already have Infinite Undiscovery on order, same with Tales.
459322	466286	And then there's also the PS3 Sega one that's coming out that I can't remember the name off the top of my head right now.
466566	469308	But that one I also have on order.
469936	496814	chat.orangelongeradio.com if you want to join in on the instant discussion there if you're listening live to us on this Sunday evening as well as five copies of Saints Row 2 for each one of our Xbox 360s nice we'll move you asked a question of us oh I was asking chat but certainly if you have an opinion too please I'm sort of thinking that Infinite Undiscovery but it depends on if I have time
498024	498824	Always depends on time.
499344	499704	That's right.
501245	502825	We'll go back to that question in just a minute.
502845	505546	Let me address this, though, related to Xbox stories.
506286	512968	Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, the Xbox Live Arcade game with the longest freaking title ever.
513568	520249	You know it's going into beta, and the beta was purchased through Commando 3, which just went on Xbox Live Arcade this past week.
520990	524050	That beta is going to open up on June 25th.
524170	526491	That would be next Wednesday.
527171	542918	is when this beta is going to go live now remember about the beta though you only basically get Ken Ryu in one stage so it's not really a whole lot to the game but hey at least you do get to take a peek at what this game is going to look like so again that all starts on June 25th
545765	549507	Going to the question that I asked earlier, looking in chat at some of the answers here.
550687	550947	Let's see.
551047	553228	Joshi16 says, I don't have the time anymore.
553288	554829	I want to try Eternal Sonata.
554909	555709	I'm so behind.
556130	558331	Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm behind on a lot of these games too.
558731	559251	Damn wow.
559951	561632	GameGuru says, OLR, not really.
561712	566214	Maybe the Blue Dragon games because Blue Dragon is from Team Chrono Trigger.
566574	572677	I got to tell you though, the first Blue Dragon game, not what you would have hoped for.
573433	574033	It's okay.
574574	578956	Imagine a Super Nintendo classic RPG on an Xbox 360.
579016	580497	That's kind of what Blue Dragon was.
581517	585679	But unfortunately the story was a little generic as a lot of RPGs tended to be back then.
586760	587100	Sorry.
588841	589081	Alright.
590141	590742	That was really it.
591162	592863	We didn't get a whole lot of comments on that in chat.
593063	594864	Osfer says he wants to get Eternal Sonata for PS3.
595264	596905	I guess they do have the extra stuff.
597045	597445	So we'll see.
599826	600827	I wish I hadn't looked at this.
602754	603895	I really wish I hadn't looked at this.
604115	604656	Well, what's that?
607018	608820	I'm not going to spoil it for anybody else.
609261	611203	And actually, this really isn't that bad of a spoiler.
611783	613325	But I'm still not going to say anything about it.
614045	620192	Because there is a voice acting casting callout for a second Portal game.
621893	623335	I'm not going to say anything about it.
624997	627419	So we don't know what it is or why, it's just out there.
627439	629020	I know why, I know what it is now.
629160	630001	But it's a spoilery.
630281	631642	Don't want to spoil it for anybody.
632303	640450	If you want to know, you can actually hunt it down on... I hate most gaming blogs around the story this week.
641070	642531	But I'm not going to ruin it.
643352	645534	I gotta say though that the premise sounds awesome.
647628	650311	From what I read of it, it sounds very interesting.
650351	651252	You knew it was coming.
651272	652973	You knew a Portal 2 had to happen somehow.
653073	656517	So I'm glad they will make it work one way or the other.
657518	657938	We'll see.
659480	659780	All right.
662639	663700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
682136	685739	was a new map for Halo 3 called Cold Storage.
686019	696828	And what Cold Storage is, is actually a remake, or I guess a map that resembles the Chill Out level from the first Halo game.
697069	704275	So, it's kind of interesting, it kind of falls in line with, you know, the other maps that have been released, kind of a lot of remakes, and that...
704935	709257	I guess, inspired by previous game maps and stuff like that.
709437	714759	So, no word on when this will be coming to us, but probably something like in the fall or summer.
714779	716499	You know, another map pack.
717940	718440	But pretty cool.
720281	720601	Alright.
721721	722982	Sounds interesting.
724082	725323	Although I'm kind of over Halo 3.
725783	728284	I don't know about the rest of y'all.
728364	731085	It didn't have the lasting power that Halo 2 did, sadly.
733818	737419	The Maw is a new game that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
737579	744761	The first time I look at this and I see this little creature in a little screenshot from The Maw, I think it's something I see out of Spore or something.
745161	753524	Actually, what Maw is, is that is kind of the little mouth creature on a pet blob that is featured in the game.
754424	758305	You can actually use this little creature to eat a house or...
759005	760887	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
779367	791984	Twisted Pixel is the people behind the game and they promise that they will have a lengthy single player mode, cut scenes that are described as intense and cutting edge graphics for Xbox Live Arcade.
792044	793365	No word on when this will be out.
793646	795588	Hopefully a little sooner than Castle Crashers.
797070	797471	We'll see.
799133	802795	Meanwhile, let's take a look at what you guys have to say in our mailbag.
802835	809060	Every week we open up our mailbag to you guys to send us your emails and your love and adoration or your hate mail.
809400	812322	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
812382	815384	DarkSakura's going to dive in right now, pick a few of her favorites, read them for you.
815844	817805	We got a bunch of them, but they're not that long.
818125	819546	Okay.
819566	821327	First one comes from...
823486	824507	I'm just going to say James.
825688	828711	Is there a date on how long Deoxys is available?
828791	834416	I'm in Germany and my cartridge is in Texas to get the event item for Darkrai.
835157	837979	So I may need to ask someone to take the cartridge to GameStop.
840201	840822	I didn't see.
841222	842363	I don't remember seeing one either.
842423	843565	I will try to find the answer.
846847	849310	You may have to get a friend over here to get it for you or something somehow.
850922	853283	This one comes from our friend in Kenya.
854924	857926	Hi, OR, I've been listening to tonight's show and I'm thrilled you read my email.
858146	859486	Wait, no, this guy's fake.
859586	860047	I proved it.
860767	862028	He's on our Facebook community.
863157	870703	I'm not sure how I'm supposed to prove who I am, but I will try and find a way to get a hold of the camera to take a picture of Samara's Cafe.
870743	871403	Have a good night.
871423	873545	They're in the USA from Kenya, and that's from Taiwan.
885669	887930	I just want to know, what the hell is this?
888851	890692	Just come clean, I caught you.
892173	894474	The name in your email is in our Facebook community.
896915	897636	You got caught.
897956	898476	Now admit it.
898917	900317	Alright, next email.
901398	902519	But I still want to see the picture.
902579	904420	I kind of want to see what you were going to do.
909442	911203	This one comes from the guy with the cool email.
911524	911884	Saltech.
913829	919632	Just wondering if any of you know whether Sony ever plans to let you play PSP games using your PS3 via remote play.
920012	923974	I hate the PSP's control, but it seems all the games I like are coming out for it, i.e.
924014	926415	Kingdom Hearts 3, God of War 3, Final Fantasy 7.
928156	940182	It just seems like it would be smart because it would only take an update to do, and I know personally that a few of my friends would pick up both the PS3 and PSP just to do this, and the others, since they already have a PS3, would just buy the PS3.
940762	941863	He means Crisis Core.
942083	942623	That's what I meant.
942864	943684	That's what I was thinking.
944465	947026	Awesome Show Never Let It Stop, Salt Tech.
949708	949928	Okay.
951369	954170	So, wait, wait, was the question, should he get the PSP, or?
955191	956632	If they're ever going to have the remote play.
957472	959033	Oh, remote play on PSP.
959374	961195	I thought they already had something like that.
961635	965978	I think he's talking about in the other direction, where you can play PSP games on your PS3.
966638	969700	Oh, um... Maybe someday.
970540	971081	Thanks for watching!
991312	1001233	I can understand that, and maybe Sony will do that whole compatibility in reverse thing, but because of the video out, and because Sony doesn't feel that their controller sucks, don't hold your breath.
1001794	1002034	Sorry.
1003680	1003860	GeekBoy
1029471	1033413	Hey, OLR crew, I've been looking unsuccessfully for free lessons in programming languages.
1033914	1038656	I've wanted to learn how to learn programming languages for some time now.
1039217	1042218	And I wanted to know if you knew any good websites and which languages I should learn.
1042298	1043059	Thanks, Geekboy.
1045600	1048042	Well, you can learn to learn anything, I suppose.
1048382	1053845	But if you want to start off, you know, easy, try something like, you know,
1055450	1059732	Visual Basic, maybe, because you can use that in Word and all kinds of other programs.
1059792	1060233	You know what?
1060293	1062974	If he ain't writing in ZZT, you ain't shit.
1065996	1066576	I'm just kidding.
1067937	1069938	No, you need to learn Fortran.
1070918	1071839	Jeez, Pascal.
1071859	1072459	How about Logo?
1074659	1075740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1094338	1098361	That game will teach you a lot about programming, even though it's like years old.
1098661	1103865	And a lot of these games that are game maker type games, it's a really good place to start.
1104165	1109909	Because programming and all that is a lot about logic and a way of thinking and debugging your stuff.
1109930	1110490	That's why I don't do it.
1110510	1111170	I'm not logical.
1111651	1112051	Hey, look.
1112371	1116354	When I originally went to college, I was studying originally like computer programming.
1116394	1118135	And I started with a C++ class.
1118616	1119577	I hated it.
1119857	1121478	And I decided this is not for me.
1121698	1128301	I quit database management because as soon as I went through the VBasic stuff, I was like, I hate this.
1129221	1134003	There's a lot of people in chat yelling C++, Java, C, Basic.
1135143	1135844	I would say, honestly...
1137605	1138947	Who uses basic anymore?
1139367	1140488	But why not?
1141168	1141749	But here's the thing.
1142169	1149054	Start with one of these game maker type programs that teach you how to think logically and debug your games.
1149455	1151636	Then you're ready to start with a programming language.
1151856	1152297	Think about it.
1153720	1168219	And seriously, check out ZZT, it rocks Xenocore says, turn him to Game Maker 7 Make a game while you learn coding techniques That's exactly the kind of thing I'm thinking is a good starting point Because if you try to just jump in and learn C You're going to be in over your head, buddy Yeah
1169005	1172748	You've got to have the... You always build up to whatever.
1172848	1173029	Yeah.
1173309	1176191	And Alpha Canogram says TI-83 Basic for the win.
1176272	1177032	Hell yeah!
1177192	1177893	I had one.
1178514	1182577	I had the Texas Instruments computer that had the little cartridges that you slid on the side.
1183018	1184239	And I had the Basic book.
1184781	1188203	I will write you a Commodore 64 basic program right now.
1188243	1188664	Here we go.
1189564	1195088	10 space print space quote Rob is awesome quote enter.
1195868	1198650	20 space go to 10 enter.
1199371	1199691	Run.
1201172	1202613	Programming lesson here on OLR.
1203363	1205745	Make sure you've got plenty of printer paper.
1220951	1224236	Anyway, this one comes from Katamari's Forever.
1224916	1229443	First of all, I want to thank you, OLR, for naming Space Channel 5 your classic game of the week last week.
1229823	1231786	I was beaming with excitement when Jamie said those words.
1231886	1234229	Actually, thank Sauce for that, because she's the one who told me to do it.
1236271	1236992	Thank you, Sauce.
1237172	1239795	Thank you, even though you're not listening to us to watch the Tony Awards.
1240896	1242738	She didn't hear that now because she's watching the Tony Awards.
1243819	1247823	Second, I want to give a shout out to an OL Army, Carizzle.
1248724	1252108	It's nice that I found him on another forum, Red Flag Deals.
1252548	1255792	Do you get excited when you see a random OL Army around an event?
1257165	1272975	Yeah, and by the way, this reminds me, I finally got around to making a character on the Ragnarok server that you have to guess which one I'm playing on, named DarkSakura with the party OL Army, so if you find me, you get a prize.
1273715	1274676	I'm not going to tell you where I am, though.
1275476	1275696	Nice.
1275996	1276657	Only a few people know.
1278231	1281073	And third, remember when someone nuked your article from Wikipedia?
1281213	1289759	I was laughing out loud when I found out that under the beautiful Katamari article was none other than you, OLR, when the article referenced the story you posted about the game.
1291380	1293222	I guess you're in places you think you're not in.
1293702	1297345	Anyway, wanted to say I'm playing Space Channel 5 Part 2 now and talk to you later.
1297405	1298205	Katamari's forever.
1298846	1299066	Yes.
1299986	1300247	Go ahead.
1300867	1301167	Rob!
1301508	1301688	What?
1302824	1304485	Remember that's still a live parody thread?
1304565	1306667	Well, I finished the song and put it on this email.
1307087	1307487	Please listen.
1307507	1308648	It would be greatly appreciated.
1309008	1310029	Or maybe put in a bonus segment.
1310049	1311210	How about we make that our fortune cookie?
1312050	1314552	Or, better yet, so the podcast listeners can hear it.
1314592	1315753	We will play it at the end of the show.
1316618	1318720	I don't even remember why, what we had to do with that game.
1318740	1321003	I guess we were... Did we announce it earlier or something?
1321023	1321363	I don't remember.
1321383	1321823	Guitar Hero 80s Edition.
1338681	1339662	What about 80s edition?
1339982	1342063	We're linked from the article in Wikipedia.
1342383	1344184	Like, for some reason, we're referenced in the article.
1344584	1345204	I don't remember why.
1345284	1346385	I think we may have talked about it earlier.
1346405	1346625	Whatever.
1347165	1347525	Whatever.
1348626	1349186	Here's my question.
1349206	1351607	Did anyone ever try to recreate the Wiki article?
1351988	1352588	They should.
1352888	1353608	I think so, too.
1353949	1354589	Recreate it.
1354649	1362733	The reason why it got nuked is because they said it wasn't sourced or that it didn't prove its relevance or whatever.
1362793	1364434	But, dude, we're coming up on our sixth birthday.
1365265	1365686	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1372130	1379456	Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s was initially announced by EGM in January 2007 as Guitar Hero 1980s Edition.
1379836	1386701	Orange Lounge Radio claimed that the game would be released in June 2007 based on an Activision announcement, though no other source has cited this announcement.
1387161	1395328	Activision officially revealed the first details of the game as May 11, 2007, in addition to changing the game's title to Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s.
1395968	1398689	And it never came out, though, in that time.
1398849	1400050	I remember what it was, though.
1400070	1405152	It was some type of sales presentation thing that you had.
1406332	1407253	I remember that's what it was.
1407273	1408393	That's why no one else would have had it.
1409654	1411074	Yeah.
1411494	1412255	I remember what it was from.
1412295	1418517	It was from Destination PlayStation because it's retailers only.
1418697	1419117	No press.
1420138	1420378	Uh-huh.
1421281	1424483	This one goes for the World of Warcraft players.
1425143	1425463	Yay!
1425743	1427524	From Lord Katakos.
1428805	1430446	What server do you guys play WoW on?
1431266	1434788	Also, my 77 priest I mailed you about two months ago was hacked.
1435448	1439550	But I restarted on a private server called Dagon MS, I guess.
1439931	1441391	And I'm now level 168.
1442332	1443873	Wait, you can't be that high in WoW.
1443893	1445273	Are you sure this is about WoW or is this RagnarKrak?
1448049	1449070	Horde side, Horde has cookies
1477068	1481572	Okay, I looked up Dagon MS and it's a freaking MapleStory.
1482933	1483794	MapleStory?
1485756	1486436	Get out of here!
1487617	1488238	I'm just kidding.
1488298	1489679	Jamie doesn't play MapleStory.
1490059	1490500	The end.
1492201	1492922	Help me don't play that.
1493422	1495144	And, by the way, the...
1496693	1498154	Thank you for watching!
1521465	1535515	if anyone wants to find out and it's only going to be a casual guild I'm not going to let anyone else invite anyone unless I trust them but find me on what is that chat thing we use?
1535675	1536736	IRC and I might tell you
1540048	1548570	I want to point out too, because this is in the JustinTV chat, going back to the kid who was asking about the programming languages, wanting to know more about where to start with that.
1549110	1556452	AkumaJP, who works for game companies in Japan, suggests download the iPhone SDK.
1556592	1557112	It's fun.
1557172	1557873	Start from there.
1558113	1558693	Not see, though.
1559573	1560453	I didn't even think about that.
1560493	1562614	There's that whole new development kit that iPhone's got.
1562954	1564574	That'd be kind of fun.
1565674	1566375	Good suggestion.
1566395	1567715	It's actually officially supported now.
1570446	1573646	Hey OLR, Amplitude here.
1574867	1581648	I'm listening to Part B of this week's show at work, and the whole tangent on how awesome arcades used to be really got me to start thinking.
1582088	1588990	We, or at least those of us from that era, certainly can name some arcades that are on the decline and what happened, but reminiscing will only get us so far.
1589330	1592411	I feel like we never quite found an explanation for this.
1592851	1598653	Can we point fingers at corporate America and say that things were bought out and consequently ambushed?
1599174	1602255	But is anyone else looking at it from a different perspective?
1602295	1604816	What about the kids that go to the arcades or lack thereof?
1605256	1613139	Nowadays, if you were spotted at a local arcade, you're pegged as a gamer and all the stereotypes are realized and you begin to accumulate what can only be described as loser points.
1614571	1616232	Sorry for the long email slash rant amplitude.
1616252	1616332	P.S.
1616352	1619773	This email brought to you by Subject Hometown here, home of the test subject here.
1619853	1621053	I see what you did there.
1638704	1639324	Good thought.
1640125	1640665	I don't know.
1640725	1643786	I don't think we ever did get down to the bottom of what happened to arcades.
1644946	1646767	There was money to be made in birthday parties.
1646827	1648947	Maybe we should do our first investigative story.
1649107	1651308	An OLR, investigative report.
1651728	1652348	Seriously.
1652889	1653209	Maybe.
1653549	1654009	We should.
1655229	1657390	Jamie, you head that up because I wouldn't even know where to begin.
1657410	1658931	Jamie goes to college and works full time.
1659211	1662252	Rob works full time and Rob has other things going on too.
1662352	1662912	Okay, you know.
1663192	1663372	Okay.
1665569	1668591	Don't you work full time and is very busy with other things.
1668611	1670573	Junami, get on that.
1671393	1671714	All right.
1672154	1673735	There's a shiny dollar in it for you.
1673795	1676838	I have a Susan B with your name on it.
1678159	1682702	But I do want to, one part of the email said people don't go because they're afraid of being a nerd.
1683322	1683623	No.
1683763	1685164	No, that can't be true.
1685904	1687666	People are dorks because they go to arcades?
1688834	1689575	by some guy who doesn't know you
1703243	1703503	I know.
1704304	1705084	I'm just being a bitch.
1705385	1709728	But seriously, you know, it's like, I don't... The hell with what they think!
1710028	1711209	So what if they think you're a geek?
1711229	1718454	Also, Cheeseburger points out for programming languages, PHP, Python, C++, Java, Ruby, Perl, and if you learn HTML, it will be easier.
1719555	1720035	Like, okay?
1721236	1722237	HTML is freaking easy.
1723998	1726920	So... We're almost done.
1727501	1727741	Hooray.
1728732	1731553	Hello OLR, it is Janai from Las Vegas.
1732133	1736314	As of typing this email, I have returned from the Video Game Live concert in Henderson, Nevada.
1736734	1738175	It is a must-see event.
1738315	1743737	I wore my Professor Layton costume and gave people gold coins that noticed who I was dressed as.
1745277	1753160	I was backstage for the costume contest and even though I didn't win, I got to see Martin Leung, the famous piano player who played the Super Mario theme blindfolded on YouTube.
1753660	1757601	I quickly said, I love your YouTube videos and he replied with a cool thank you and that made my day.
1758382	1764564	Awesome lighting, great music selection, both new and classic games, and Tommy Tallarico kept changing his clothes, which was strange.
1765624	1768345	I give this show a solid 100% rating.
1768885	1773187	If it's coming to your town or close by, you must see it, and yes, they have international dates this year.
1774994	1777355	You know, I'm really glad you read that email.
1777636	1781718	Because it gives me a chance to say we have a guest coming on the show.
1781858	1783319	Not next week, but the week after.
1783359	1785520	He's going to be on the show on the 29th.
1785660	1786521	Sunday the 29th.
1787241	1790844	Tommy Tallarico is going to be on Orange Lounge Radio to talk about video games live.
1790864	1793785	And I will ask him for you about why the wardrobe changed.
1794646	1794846	Okay.
1796792	1802980	So, yeah, and we're going to be asking you about the world tour and what people can expect this year and all that fun stuff.
1803000	1805242	And then all expenses paid tickets to see it overseas.
1807165	1807625	Don't push it.
1808867	1810809	But no, Tommy Tallarico will be here in two weeks.
1811169	1811370	Sweet.
1812301	1812681	Last one!
1842148	1849232	Yes, by the way, just to answer the questions in chat, Tommy will not actually be here in studio because he has this whole Video Games Live thing going on he's also trying to do.
1850273	1852554	But he will take a little time to... We're going to have a seance and channel in.
1852714	1853615	Plug it on our show!
1854015	1854175	Yes.
1855236	1857377	Last one comes from our very good friend Vandalus.
1859241	1860062	We miss you!
1860122	1861303	Happy Father's Day, Vandalist.
1861343	1862465	Happy Father's Day to you.
1862505	1864667	He's got a small army.
1864767	1867470	I have lost count of how many children Vandalist has.
1867650	1868211	I think five.
1868912	1869212	Yeah.
1869472	1870173	It's at least five.
1870233	1871174	Happy Father's Day.
1871695	1872556	You've earned it.
1872916	1873477	Yes, you have.
1873597	1874077	Quite a bit.
1874458	1875299	Several times over.
1875999	1876620	And we miss you.
1876660	1877401	We really miss you.
1877481	1878402	Come back and visit us soon.
1878622	1878923	Mm-hmm.
1880203	1882484	Hey gang, it's Terry slash Vandalist.
1883064	1884545	I hope you're all doing well.
1884625	1891528	I wanted to pass on a news story I just blogged about in my weekend news job at www.hardocp.com
1895838	1924078	it's about the US Army's new recruitment tactic Interactive Centers and he sent me a link to it but he continues with full size mockups Apache helicopter simulations look like America's Army was just the beginning and tells us to take care and actually what it is is they're having recruitment centers set up with simulators for full scale mockups of equipment and a gaming arena that uses America's Army and
1925238	1938847	so that instead of doing the whole, having a commercial to show what you might happen, they actually have something that, in fact, it was even quoted from Major Larry Dillard, who's a U.S.
1938887	1940108	Army marketing executive.
1940148	1944431	He said, the modeling command and control systems are like those used in Iraq.
1946172	1960226	Like we said earlier, there's an Apache simulator for pilot and co-pilot that uses the flight and weapon system, a Black Hawk helicopter that has four door gunner positions and an armored Humvee vehicle simulator.
1963269	1965291	Actually, I kind of want to do that myself.
1965451	1966252	Humvee simulator?
1966732	1968694	Yeah, with turrets and that type of thing.
1970419	1972141	It just makes me think of that.
1972381	1973141	What was that movie?
1974362	1975604	The Army is innovative.
1976144	1977765	They're very innovative at this stuff.
1978026	1978886	They do their job well.
1980348	1981368	That's all I can really say.
1982289	1982990	Smart folks there.
1983710	1986072	And they're using that wonderful America's Army.
1986793	1988394	Wait, whatever happened to America's Army 2?
1988495	1989535	Oh yeah, that's right.
1989575	1990496	That game sucked.
1990556	1991877	I think it's still going.
1992318	1993859	It's got a cult following to it.
1995801	1996061	All right.
1998134	1998914	That it for Mailbag?
1999294	1999575	Yes!
1999675	2001355	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2001375	2002175	Let's get back to some news.
2003096	2003336	Yes.
2004036	2005557	And this is kind of funny, though.
2005937	2012179	Apparently, there is a game someone noticed that's reusing Oblivion's graphics.
2013039	2019762	And the game itself is called Limbo of the Lost, which just sounds weird anyways.
2020342	2023443	And it is blatantly ripping off Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
2023503	2025044	In fact, they had a screenshot...
2026567	2034055	Comparison, and... Yeah, it's near identical, except for maybe the fire effects are shittier than the other game.
2035276	2035756	No word...
2038548	2041411	No word on what else they may have stolen.
2042211	2045374	It says apparently also... Oh, there are some updates to the story.
2045754	2050498	Apparently also they stole an environment from Thief Deadly Shadows as well.
2051739	2055502	And apparently Joystick just heard back from the U.S.
2055562	2061187	publisher TriSynergy who told them that the similarities between the two are striking...
2061687	2066230	But we were just as shocked as anybody else and we put the line into Majestic.
2067431	2072954	We had no idea that any of this had been happening in the game and things would have been different if we had known.
2073775	2076016	Wait, Bethesda is making this game themselves?
2076216	2077717	No, Majestic.
2077817	2085022	Majestic is the company making the game and it's being published by some company called TriSynergy.
2085242	2089245	Well, Majestic actually made a phone call to Bethesda and this is what they had to say.
2092640	2096285	Except in this case, they actually can't do it that much better.
2096305	2097327	No, they can't.
2097547	2097827	And, uh...
2108683	2109624	That's kind of funny though.
2110065	2118035	I wonder what else they're going to... It says they also think that the game stole some artwork from Diablo 2.
2119497	2122340	A shield called the Wall of Eyeless or something.
2123461	2125023	Very nice.
2125083	2126205	They're stealing from everybody.
2126365	2130987	Azaku says bullshit who the fuck was producing that game and greenlighted the copyrighted textures without consulting a lawyer
2156277	2156477	Hmm.
2157898	2158499	Is it bullshit?
2159180	2159900	Or is it the real deal?
2160681	2161422	Only time will tell.
2164284	2166847	Meanwhile, let's go back to some more gaming news.
2167487	2171851	In the law world, two guys are suing EA.
2173234	2174155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2188510	2208118	And they're saying that because of the NFL license, EA is engaging in, quote, blatantly anti-competitive conduct, and they are seeking, quote, restitution and damages for those who purchased an EA football game since August of 2005, disgorgement of all profits made as a result of anti-competitive actions, and that the infringing agreements be declared null and void.
2209326	2209746	Thanks for watching!
2226940	2228981	Not EA, as much as I hate to say that.
2229461	2237483	And for those of you that don't understand legal translation so much, we actually had somebody try to simplify this lawsuit for us, and they translated it for us.
2237543	2237923	Here it is.
2238724	2240044	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
2240084	2242165	Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
2242485	2243265	Bitch, bitch, bitch.
2244445	2244825	There it is.
2245506	2246606	That's what this lawsuit's all about.
2248807	2256469	Anyhow, stories like this, I don't know about you guys, but whenever I hear about all these type of frivolous lawsuit type things, I get a little bit angsty.
2257691	2258511	and Mad.
2259171	2261412	And that always necessitates some FUs.
2278915	2282395	To myself, I left my laptop at home and had to go back and get it.
2284276	2285116	Hence my late arrival.
2287583	2314869	Alright, Loki FD is the guy in front of me at Burger King because apparently he didn't know what he wanted to order and then he proceeded to order like half the menu because I was waiting behind him for like 10 minutes while he proceeded to wait for his food to be delivered to his car in about 5 to 6 bags Nice Yes, I love people Oh, and he was smoking right there in front of the window too Nice Which is awesome, he's a winner
2319187	2322588	My FU of the week goes to the root canal I had on Thursday.
2323408	2323568	Ow.
2325529	2326589	Root canals are not fun.
2327890	2330530	An FU to the fact that I think there's a problem with it.
2330590	2330851	I don't know.
2330871	2332471	I'm going to have to see the dentist next week.
2332651	2333491	FU to dentistry.
2335172	2335972	That's my FU of the week.
2336012	2337273	Let's get back to gaming news.
2338133	2338833	Do we gotta?
2338953	2339513	We gotta.
2340054	2340614	Okay.
2341694	2342334	Penny Arcade.
2343915	2344215	Cool.
2345615	2345916	I think.
2346536	2347036	Nope, I'm wrong.
2348100	2349061	Oh, did you get ahead of yourself?
2349661	2350121	Yeah, I did.
2350141	2351302	Penny Arcade, coming up soon.
2351822	2352062	Yes.
2352122	2352983	Later in the program.
2354043	2354563	Squeenix!
2355184	2355404	Yes.
2356945	2367791	There actually is a trailer up for the new MMO, Concerto Gate, and it's going to be a free MMO RPG, and it's pretty.
2371493	2376755	It's actually the sequel to Crossgate, which was an MMO that was in Japan since 2001.
2378363	2380104	and it's just very cute.
2381586	2383127	So I want to give it a try.
2383567	2385649	Hooray for free and hooray for cute, right?
2385969	2387230	As long as it's not MapleStory.
2389211	2389532	Alright.
2390032	2391553	Why all the hate for MapleStory?
2391693	2392034	I don't know.
2392074	2393375	I've never even played MapleStory.
2393475	2394235	It doesn't look fun.
2395216	2396377	Oh, I'm sorry.
2396457	2399620	You know, spoiled Ragnarok online.
2401121	2402742	Ragnarok has withstood the test of time.
2403362	2403783	Yeah.
2404663	2405064	Uh-huh.
2405124	2405544	Sure has.
2407706	2407986	Anyways.
2409389	2415372	One thing Ragnarok does not have that Dungeon Runners does have is a bling gnome.
2416072	2417513	That's right, a bling gnome.
2417993	2420614	What per se is a bling gnome, you may ask?
2421215	2422495	Well, I'm about to tell you.
2422795	2423716	It's a gnome with bling?
2424748	2425629	Yeah, sort of.
2426089	2435698	A bling gnome is a pet of sorts that runs around and picks up all gold dropped from bad guys while you also kill other things.
2436359	2443205	And the gnome also will pick up dropped items that aren't rare and eat them.
2443626	2445968	Then he poops out gold as a reward.
2446288	2447990	That's the best thing ever!
2448590	2450132	I want a gnome that poops gold!
2451823	2475943	and they have screenshots to back it up yes, the bling gnome who either has loot or woot tattooed to his stomach I don't know but it's kind of funny and for those who may not be familiar with Dungeon Runner it is a free MMO where can you check this game out if you want to see this amazing pooping gnome?
2476424	2479967	DungeonRunners.com oh well, I should have been able to figure that one out, huh?
2480447	2482189	Oh my god, this is the best thing ever!
2482270	2484172	And he does have woot on him.
2485053	2485714	I think it's loot.
2486275	2487817	Oh, I thought it was a woot.
2487877	2488939	It could be a little of both.
2489820	2491182	Maybe woot on the front and loot on the back.
2491222	2491903	Maybe it's poot.
2492303	2495548	Because he poops out, you know.
2496854	2498875	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2520103	2520803	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2540393	2541313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2565259	2565659	SIV4 Colonization
2591701	2593101	Well, here it is.
2593482	2595782	How's that for your tremendous long wait?
2595862	2596182	Whatever.
2597263	2600043	The Penny Arcade game is now available on Steam.
2601684	2606905	And it's called Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness.
2606965	2609386	Episode 1 is there at www.
2612647	2619473	SteamGames.com and it will also be offering the future episodes there.
2620454	2623057	And there are achievements available for Steam purchasers.
2624258	2625419	So go check it out.
2626319	2627661	And by the way, the game is very funny.
2629222	2630123	There's our first review.
2630303	2631344	You heard it here.
2631564	2632465	If you haven't heard.
2633544	2634205	Now you have.
2634726	2635387	Now you know.
2635788	2637010	And knowing is half the battle.
2637771	2638232	Or whatever.
2640336	2640877	I hate you.
2641538	2643782	I hate you too.
2644543	2645064	You know me.
2646792	2651113	Well, Neverwinter Nights 2 is getting yet another expansion.
2652174	2661116	The new expansion is being called Storm of Zeher, and it's going to be the second expansion for the game that came out in 2006.
2661637	2667398	It will add a single-player campaign with approximately 15 hours of gameplay.
2667998	2673080	It will add new classes, spells, creatures, and a new playable race system.
2673741	2686892	Also, there is a new Overland map that is being introduced that will allow players to explore the Chultun Peninsula, Sword Coast, and Samarit.
2687933	2694939	And looks like they also have got... Looks like that's pretty much it.
2695039	2697501	And it's due out, I guess, the fourth quarter of this year.
2697642	2700224	So, something around Christmas, perhaps.
2700472	2701012	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2727657	2731220	One last story tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
2731240	2733962	Click on Interact With Us to see all the different ways you can give us a call.
2734282	2740387	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or our free 800 number for US and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2740427	2747372	But first, one more story for you guys, and it's a little bit of a retro, some retro goodness.
2747832	2749794	Quick, how do you get 30 lives in Contra?
2751371	2753133	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
2753233	2753814	Exactly.
2753894	2756036	Everybody knows the famous Konami code, right?
2756216	2759159	Well, how do you get all of the power-ups in Gradius?
2760480	2762502	You pause the game and then up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
2762522	2763303	How do you do it in Proteus?
2763643	2764965	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
2764985	2765305	Backwards.
2766046	2766366	Whatever.
2767267	2767867	Here's the thing.
2767887	2769629	So everybody knows that freaking Konami code.
2769929	2775255	Well, what's funny is that you can actually use this code in Google Reader.
2776741	2780163	Seriously, this code works in Google Reader, presented from Google.
2780663	2795932	If you put up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A on your keyboard, and you don't have to hit start because there is no start key on your keyboard, all of your unread items will be reset to 30, and a little ninja will come on the screen to watch you surf RSS feeds.
2798793	2800274	And you might be asking, why?
2800795	2803096	And to that I say, why the hell not?
2804244	2805205	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2829454	2831596	So you think this game is going to come out for Xbox 360?
2831636	2835120	So somebody like me who's thinking of taking the plunge to get PlayStation 3 soon to play a game like this ought to just wait?
2849975	2850615	Exactly.
2851176	2857199	One of the reasons why I think is because of the amount of if they don't pull the certain amount of system that they need that they're going to have to come over.
2857219	2857739	Notice Bioshock.
2879862	2889130	and notice Assassin's Creed that was supposed to be originally for only exclusive Xbox 360 how it goes on the other system.
2889210	2895536	So I just think that maybe they just kept everybody quiet and hopefully it's going to come over to Xbox 360 in order for them to make money.
2896955	2902561	Did you see that little thing that was making the rounds around the internet this week about kind of the joke that's inside Metal Gear about having to change discs?
2902581	2905924	And then the guy says, oh wait, no, you don't have to change discs because you're playing a Blu-ray game.
2906224	2906785	Did you see that?
2919691	2920432	Oh, no.
2920732	2921613	No, I haven't.
2921693	2923195	But I haven't seen that.
2923415	2927319	I try my best to ignore all my friends that actually bought into the hype.
2928721	2932485	I just really understand because you know how Microsoft is moving over to Blu-ray.
2933506	2934347	I understand that part.
2934387	2938071	And it doesn't necessarily need to be on a Blu-ray disc for it to work as well.
2938591	2940233	That's why I'm thinking that it's...
2941258	2945581	There's a good chance it could... They could always revamp it and change it, you know, for it to work with 360.
2946302	2954388	Yeah, but even if Microsoft came out with a Blu-ray player, which, you know, that rumor... We brought that rumor up on last week's show and then Monday came, no announcement.
2954668	2959691	But let's say Microsoft did come out with a Blu-ray player, although at this point I don't think they will until their next system.
2960092	2961172	But let's say they did.
2961212	2962433	Let's say they came out with a Blu-ray player.
2962453	2966837	I don't think they're going to start putting out games on that player because they're going to want to tap into their existing user base.
2966877	2969919	They don't want to suddenly say games can only be on this... You know, I...
2970419	2971920	I just don't think there'd be enough market for that.
2973200	2975742	Right.
2975802	2983145	I think that the user base is bigger on Xbox 360, and I think they'd rather tap into that user base.
2983485	2992570	I think they could be more influenced by Konami, because the game isn't necessarily, it's not like Sony owns Konami in any way.
2993300	2993500	Right.
2994160	2998881	Well, you know, I would love to see the Xbox 360 port happen as well, but I don't know.
2998981	3004603	Sometimes, for whatever reason, they like to keep these things system exclusive for whatever backdoor deals happen.
3005343	3006143	So, we'll see.
3006764	3010885	Konami will keep denying it, but E3 would be a good time for them to announce it if they wanted to.
3012465	3014906	Yeah, you're right, and that didn't come up yet as well.
3015266	3015666	We'll see.
3015826	3018006	Thanks a lot.
3018627	3019427	Alright, take care, buddy.
3019447	3019987	Thanks for calling.
3021375	3023997	I'll be crossing my fingers for you on the Xbox 360 Metal Gear.
3024097	3024477	I don't know.
3024818	3026399	Part of me says not going to happen.
3026559	3028640	I think they've denied it so many times.
3028780	3032543	I think if they were to come out and release on 360 now, I don't know.
3032563	3035065	They'd have to have a lot of extras or something to kind of justify it.
3035405	3035805	But we'll see.
3036205	3036486	We'll see.
3036506	3036866	You never know.
3037807	3038767	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3038787	3039107	Who's this?
3040528	3041269	This is Oscar.
3041529	3042009	Hey, Oscar.
3042029	3042650	What's on your mind, buddy?
3044583	3045083	Not much.
3045143	3049386	I'm just happy that I managed to get my hands on the Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition this week.
3049826	3050446	Ah, what'd you think?
3050466	3051807	I didn't even reserve the game either.
3052347	3052647	What's that?
3053628	3055849	I didn't even reserve the game either, and I found it.
3056909	3058050	I think they did a pretty good job.
3058090	3061211	They knew the demand was going to be pretty high for this, so they made a lot of copies of it.
3061472	3062132	Well, what'd you think?
3062192	3063273	Surely you've opened it up by now.
3063293	3063713	What do you think?
3066194	3070116	Well, I've only had time to play about three hours of it so far, and it's pretty great.
3070236	3071557	It's like really epic.
3072397	3074058	It's like the only word you can describe it.
3075269	3078772	I think that's kind of the consensus around here at OLR Studios this evening.
3078812	3079592	The game is epic.
3080233	3081214	What makes it so epic?
3081274	3082655	Is it just the cutscenes epic?
3084016	3085437	What is it that makes the game so epic?
3086818	3097525	Well, I remember back when Hideo Kojima, he was all talking about how the PS3 was the only system he wanted to be in because he wanted it to be like a movie, basically.
3097585	3099467	I don't know, it kind of plays like a movie to me.
3100578	3100818	Hmm.
3101819	3108382	Here's my question because you have, you know, the cutscenes and we've heard a lot about the cutscenes and how they're very long and how they're very epic.
3108702	3110663	How about the game itself?
3110723	3113104	The actual game that you are playing?
3113184	3114785	I mean, is the game cool?
3116846	3118487	Well, what's it considered?
3118547	3121629	Is it like a... What kind of game is it even considered?
3121649	3123770	Is it like a strategy shooter or something like that?
3124550	3126912	A stealth action strategy game.
3126972	3127352	I don't know.
3128833	3129133	Okay.
3129373	3129613	Well...
3130976	3132698	I don't know, usually the games are kind of like that.
3133278	3138524	All I can think of is Rainbow Six maybe, but I got bored with Rainbow Six.
3138604	3139445	This, I didn't.
3139525	3141306	I'm very into it.
3142768	3149595	Is it because the story really draws you in in a way that maybe Rainbow Six doesn't really have quite the same epic cutscenes?
3150716	3151437	That has to be it.
3152377	3153659	Rainbow Six, the story was...
3155011	3155631	I don't know, board me.
3156091	3160353	As I was saying earlier in the show, Kojima's always been a bit of a storyteller, even in the NES days.
3160433	3172057	I mean, the very, very first Metal Gear game that was on the NES, or really MSX, if you want to go that far back, kind of had depth and story that not a lot of games of that time had.
3173378	3176659	Queltipo in chat says it's tactical espionage action.
3176779	3177199	I forgot.
3177780	3178960	It even says it right there on the box.
3179020	3180581	That would be the genre the game fits into.
3181701	3182942	Okay, that's what I thought it was.
3183122	3183562	There you go.
3183582	3183802	All right.
3184986	3212263	and there's no guard humping in this one I got Mario Kart Wii and I challenge you alright, we'll make it happen we'll have to set up a time I'll try to set up something in the forums this week because Bobby Blackwolf wants to have a go at it too so I'll try to set something up when we're both available alright we'll let you know alright, later buddy alright, see ya see ya
3212864	3216706	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
3216746	3217887	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3219287	3220648	This is Spazinator.
3221188	3222689	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind, buddy?
3223910	3228732	Well, I just want to kind of comment on like two or three things, if I may.
3229012	3229632	Sure.
3230153	3236016	Yeah, it's for your little rant about Nintendo earlier in Part A. Uh-huh.
3236036	3236536	Boy's next.
3237225	3239606	Only thing I'm going to say is right on.
3239927	3244369	In fact, I've been more or less boycotting them for the past 10 or 11 years.
3245130	3256376	You know, I can't speak for everyone out there, but personally, I feel that Nintendo really hasn't been pointing out anything for their systems.
3256436	3264041	They've really been overly compelling, aside from maybe one or two titles for the past couple systems.
3265220	3288697	and, uh, you know, you know, of course, you know, Super, or Smash Brothers, Brawl, and whatnot, notwithstanding, but, you know, the last really truly system they really had was the Super Nintendo, uh, but, you know, you know, granted, yeah, the N64 did have a, you know, a few good games out there, you know, like GoldenEye and whatnot, but,
3289420	3294124	You know, aside from that, ever since then, they've been going, like, downhill ever since then.
3294404	3308537	You know, I've cooled off a little bit since I got very hot-headed during Part A. And, you know, I'm a little regretful that the actions of this guy at Nintendo of Europe kind of hurts the company's image as a whole.
3308997	3313201	Right on down, you know, from people, the president, you know, from Reggie Visamay,
3313741	3319906	All the way down to the little people that work at Nintendo, you know, that probably don't deserve a boycott or what have you.
3319986	3328813	But damn it, something has got to give, and we have got to show that this guy is made of suck for making this statement and needs to...
3329794	3332737	Something beyond just a little apology needs to happen.
3333578	3348751	Because here's the thing, and the reason why I said it's part of my boycott, that if Nintendo addresses it, I would be okay with it, and I would end my boycott, is because if Nintendo were to address it, it would invalidate everything this guy said about it being for Geeks and Otaku, and this guy would look like a moron.
3350174	3362262	So that's part of the reason why I said that, you know, I will forgive and forget if Nintendo will say, look, we are going to do something about it, and it's not just for Geeks New Taku.
3363463	3374831	Yeah, well, you know, that guy's comments kind of factors into, like, you know, my opinion that, you know, over the past few years, you know, Nintendo has been
3376266	3380629	I guess it could be termed as an over-inflated ego.
3380970	3387374	They've been kind of like, I don't know if you want to call it Russ and the Laurels or whatever.
3387694	3393878	That's definitely prevalent on all sides of Nintendo.
3393918	3401583	Hold up, since Super Nintendo, after Super Nintendo, Nintendo did not exactly enjoy world success with the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube.
3401623	3404245	Granted, those systems weren't failure per se, but...
3405365	3406206	It doesn't matter.
3406246	3408326	They still think they're fucking cocky.
3409046	3410627	We see it on the retail side.
3410687	3413808	We see it also on the consumer side.
3415308	3420290	Unfortunately, it's just their mentality.
3420330	3425731	They control their market with the releasing of their systems and stuff like that.
3426231	3429873	I'm pretty sure that there's some sort of shortage going around that's intentional.
3430473	3430753	I mean...
3431815	3440083	I don't know, but at the same time, they're doing this stuff with suing third-party peripheral manufacturers.
3442165	3449413	This stuff, they have a schedule of how they're going to release this stuff, and they're going to slowly roll out stuff to keep people interested.
3449453	3450994	It's just like Wii Fit and stuff.
3451014	3454458	The Wii console, people finally have it now, and they're just like...
3455809	3458792	How can we get people interested in this console again like they were at launch?
3458952	3459332	Oh, I know.
3459352	3462034	Let's release Wii Fit now and make that fucking hard to find.
3462515	3463135	There you go.
3463436	3465557	And now it's all coming around again.
3465818	3467779	And watch when Wii Sports 2 comes out.
3468160	3468940	Here we go again.
3469401	3477688	It's just going to be a constant cycle and they're going to slowly roll out stuff that they should have rolled out at launch throughout the lifetime of this console.
3477728	3482832	Somebody needs to tell Nintendo I made you and I can break you just as easily.
3483203	3488087	So much to tell Nintendo that people are going to stop waiting for stuff to happen and they're going to move on.
3489048	3493091	Because they may buy your console, but they're not going to buy any of your games.
3493431	3495233	Or buy your virtual console stuff.
3495573	3499797	I mean, sure, they've made a little bit of money off of people from buying the console.
3499857	3503600	I can't imagine that they're making a ton of money on each console sales, but...
3505280	3524064	If people are just staying there and playing Wii Sports and then say, forget it, this online stuff, it's not happening and I can't find space to save my games and stuff and have to re-download them later, people are just going to get confused and get overwhelmed by it and they're just going to say, forget it, I'm not going to do that.
3524924	3531706	And it sucks because the people that are actually supporting them and utilizing this stuff, they're just saying, you're not important.
3533584	3562906	Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't get me wrong, you know, at least way back in the day, I used to be a really big Nintendo fanboy and whatnot, but now once I started realizing that, you know, starting with N64, you know, relatively few games were coming out that I was particularly interested in, I kind of started, you know, slowly but surely moving over to the Sony camp, and I've been with Sony now for, you know, ever since, like, roughly when Final Fantasy VII came out.
3564981	3575226	Here's the thing, and in reference to what I said and stuff, is that I'm a Nintendo fanboy too, and this is what stinks about the whole thing.
3575266	3584251	I've been so supportive of the Nintendo Wii, and I've spent a lot of money on those virtual console downloads to have this happen.
3585391	3586691	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3586711	3589232	I kind of felt the same way going years back.
3589252	3589812	And that's because they...
3615273	3630499	make comments, you know, because they weren't really keeping up with the times and they weren't, you know, their gains weren't really going up with the people that have been supporting them since way back when, you know.
3630699	3641503	Obviously, you know, the people that grew up with the original NES or SNES, eventually their tastes and gains were going to change and
3642523	3643323	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
3643343	3645204	Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind, buddy?
3669818	3670898	Oh, a lot of things.
3671078	3671979	Wait, wait, wait.
3672039	3672839	First thing I'm going to ask.
3672859	3674520	You're coming out here in like two weeks, right?
3675180	3675520	Yes.
3675540	3675820	Okay.
3676440	3679101	And you said something about you're going to fix our Justin TV cam when you're here?
3680222	3681182	I'm going to do my best.
3681262	3682783	I am very technically inclined.
3682903	3683123	All right.
3683363	3684483	Loki thinks he can do it too.
3684583	3688685	So between the two of you all, I think we're going to have a high-tech studio by the time the 4th of July rolls around.
3689485	3690445	Oh, believe you me.
3690565	3690845	All right.
3690865	3691966	You can talk about whatever you want to now.
3691986	3692146	Sorry.
3693274	3693774	Cool, cool.
3694055	3694695	A couple of things.
3694875	3700360	As for the guy from Nintendo of Europe by this comment, am I the only one that doesn't give two shits about what the hell he said?
3702842	3703463	Well, here's the thing.
3704063	3704704	I don't care.
3705224	3706766	Look, I get called a geek.
3706906	3709768	I say thanks.
3709848	3714012	Being a geek is not a bad thing, but it's the fact that he was – and I think Jamie kind of referenced this.
3714352	3718275	He was using these things as a derogatory thing, so he's basically saying –
3719016	3722297	Well, we're not going to put something out because we don't really care about the people who want this.
3722757	3735742	And it's kind of like, well, F you because if I've spent $100 on all these different virtual console games I filled up and I was planning on spending even more, then if I'm just poo-poo to you, then forget it.
3735903	3736963	I'm not going to spend any more money.
3737783	3739324	He does a valid point.
3739744	3743926	Well, the proper thing to say would have been Nintendo understands that this is –
3745563	3750424	Definitely a problem, and we are addressing it, and we are working towards fixing said problem.
3751044	3756366	Or just say, he could have just said, unfortunately, at this time, Nintendo has no fix for this.
3756666	3760287	He could have given the same BS, you know, the same line we've heard from Nintendo time and time again.
3760627	3765788	Unfortunately, at this time, folks will have to delete the game, and they can always re-download it for free.
3766109	3768189	He could have given that same line, and I wouldn't have cared.
3768249	3773631	I would have still thought, Nintendo probably needs to address their storage issue at some point, but I wouldn't have cared.
3774071	3774831	But the fact that he...
3775311	3777093	That's what it sounds like.
3791440	3796443	Right, and GameGuru says, and Iwata actually did say that, Rob, and I have nothing but nice things to say about Iwata.
3797103	3798924	I have nothing but, I am a Nintendo fanboy.
3799224	3800065	The man's done a lot.
3800705	3806929	And I'm fine with that line, because I understand they're dancing around the fact that their system has limitations, and that's the PC thing to say.
3807249	3810671	But for this guy to come out with guns a-blazin' is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.
3811691	3812512	You wanna pick a fight?
3812812	3813572	You wanna pick a fight?
3814613	3815994	Sounds like the guy was PMSing.
3816843	3817423	Seriously.
3818184	3818404	Yes.
3819404	3820345	No more Nintendo Talk.
3820385	3820785	Seriously.
3820805	3821866	I'm done with it.
3822126	3823166	So what else is on your mind?
3824187	3827469	I remember growing up that arcades were the shit.
3827569	3832632	I remember growing up, my aunt would take me to this place called Nathan's.
3832752	3833592	You go inside.
3833832	3835113	It was like heaven.
3835593	3839055	It was like 50, 60 different kinds of arcades you could play.
3839315	3843137	And that's why I first got my hands on Final Fight and fell in love with Capcom right there.
3843778	3844078	Mm-hmm.
3845689	3852992	and nowadays it's like you go into like a little rinky-dink sports center where they have hockey, ice skating.
3853252	3855133	You go upstairs, there's a concession stand.
3855293	3858975	You go around the corner, there's three arcade machines and a bootleg Cusar.
3859895	3866998	The place I remember was a little place called Nickel Mania where you would pay $2.50 to get in and then all the games ran on nickels.
3867738	3868439	It was awesome.
3868479	3870439	That's like the first place I ever played Mortal Kombat.
3871580	3872540	That's cool.
3872620	3874061	Sadly, it's no more.
3875222	3875822	Hey, you know what?
3876063	3888951	When you make your visit out here, we're going to have to take you to Roseville Golf Land because that's really one of the last actual arcades.
3890451	3891992	I'm glad you didn't throw in good in there.
3893753	3894574	It's what we got.
3894814	3896735	I think that's a good way to phrase it.
3896755	3899557	Dan went to Scandia and he said that it's just completely meh.
3900878	3904020	Well, Scandia is just confused on what it's trying to be anyways.
3904976	3909620	We might have to take a trip to Milpitas Golf Land.
3910661	3912903	Because that one's still fairly decent.
3912923	3916567	Yeah, Milpitas and Sunnyvale are still okay.
3916707	3918949	Sunnyvale also has the test machines though.
3919489	3922672	But slowly that stuff's been going out and Flamin' Fingers has been coming in.
3922732	3925394	Not that Flamin' Fingers is a bad thing, but too much of it is.
3926135	3927076	What about the jump rope game?
3927637	3932084	We're going to have to also go to John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.
3932585	3934628	Oh, we do need to go to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
3934688	3937032	And you still haven't sent me a certain email, sir.
3938957	3941459	No problem, I'll resend it out.
3942219	3942600	Thank you.
3942620	3945021	Alright, Ranma, quickly, anything else before we end the show?
3945041	3945662	Uh, no, that's it.
3945682	3946182	Alright, take care, buddy.
3946202	3946442	You too.
3946462	3946642	Bye-bye.
3970548	3972990	Rob D says, too much of the flaming finger is a bad thing.
3973051	3975193	Let me clarify my statement.
3975273	3978476	Too much of the flaming finger requires soothing action.
3978496	3981339	There's nothing wrong with a little flaming finger here and there.
3982140	3986404	You don't want to OD on flaming finger.
3987605	3988867	You need to mix it up a little bit.
3990137	3990698	Alright, forget it.
3991599	3992921	That's going to do it for phone calls tonight.
3992941	3993963	Thank you guys for calling in.
3993983	3996626	If you didn't get through, so sorry, but send us an email or try again next week.
3997808	3999130	Or you can always leave a voicemail.
3999931	4001033	I've got voicemails we've got to play.
4001053	4002455	We'll try to catch up on those in a future week.
4002815	4004377	For now, we've got to wrap it up.
4005504	4006485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4026762	4027083	What?
4027183	4027563	What?
4027603	4027864	What?
4045325	4051009	where it pays off to select different characters depending on the enemies you face or unique game environments you are in.
4051489	4053651	Earn upgrades for each character you use.
4053991	4061397	Experience unique combos specific to two... Are they just reusing the Marvel Ultimate Alliance engine like over and over and over again?
4061497	4062177	I mean, seriously.
4062417	4064178	Or I should say X-Men Legends engine.
4065800	4067361	Alright, anyways.
4068602	4069843	Let's see what else here.
4072244	4072745	We've got...
4075091	4085640	Some more stuff coming from this big leak list here, including... Oh, we already talked about all this stuff.
4085660	4086941	They have the Mensa workout.
4087462	4089563	I guess this is going to be another brain training game for the Wii.
4091025	4094908	And I don't know how extreme Makeover Home Edition is going to be any fun.
4095469	4095809	We'll see.
4097442	4101763	Um, there was a game I had on the Commodore 64 called like Dream House or something like that.
4101843	4108805	And pretty much all you did is you went through the house and you could paint all the, like you could paint the ceiling and the walls a different color, one of 16 colors.
4108885	4112946	Cause you know, Commodore 64 was cutting edge and then you could put furniture in the house too.
4113507	4116527	And, but you were only limited to like eight pieces of furniture in a room.
4116607	4118188	Cause you know, there's all those limitations on the 64.
4118968	4121710	I hope to God that half these games are fake.
4121870	4126072	Or not really fake, but just concepts that are never going to come to pass.
4126092	4131356	Because if that's the case, there's going to be like 20 Spider-Man games coming out between now and probably a couple years from now.
4131996	4138660	Including Spider-Man Agile Warrior, where it lets players control Spider-Man with the Wii balance board.
4138940	4141702	There's Spider-Man Hero Evolved for the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.
4143243	4148967	Replay as the son of Spider-Man in 2064 using spider powers and future tech to battle villains.
4149967	4152929	There's Spider-Man New Heights for the 360 PS3 and the Wii.
4153009	4160274	Upgrades Spidey's abilities as he moves from battling low-level gangs to famous foes in the New York skyline.
4161995	4163316	Spider-Man Gangs of New York.
4164316	4165097	Okay, seriously.
4166177	4170220	Gangs take over the whole city and Spider-Man must pit them against each other.
4173050	4180038	Spider-Man Adaption Spidey travels all over the globe from Tokyo to Paris to Moscow to take out foes.
4180498	4182280	Marvel Team-Up Spider-Man meets X-Men.
4182421	4184082	I think that was the one I was talking about earlier.
4184523	4187726	Spider-Man Contest of Champions 360, PS3, and Wii.
4188027	4192852	Destructible Fighter for 2-4 players with Spider-Man, Venom, Wolverine, Electro...
4193252	4196395	Electro, Doc Ock, Carnage, and the Green Goblin.
4196935	4199758	Spider-Man Mass Evolution for all three systems.
4200418	4206423	Spidey skills from strength to speed to spidey sense are upgradable as you play.
4206944	4207805	Spider-Man Chaos.
4210242	4230292	Spidey has 8 hours of frenetic action to save from certain doom Spider-Man Tactics, a stealthy and strategic Spidey game Spider-Man Vision, first and third person gameplay Spidey style Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies Spider-Man Webmaster
4231352	4244021	for the Wii, a web shooting game for a third person action, Spider-Man Web Slinger, use precision web aiming to target enemies building or build web slingshots and snipe enemies.
4246339	4252122	I think some of those are all ideas, but aren't going to come out, because that would be way too much.
4253743	4263928	The avatars, one of the things that people noticed, there were some licensed things with them as well, so maybe some licensed clothing and stuff, you'll be able to get it, because they had one of them with an Incredibles t-shirt.
4265028	4267129	Sounds kind of neat.
4268130	4268950	Let's see here.
4271432	4272032	Oh, um...
4273024	4273604	Ultimate Band.
4273844	4279346	They're going to be doing an Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version, apparently, of the game.
4280367	4285929	And it will be, to I'm sure Rob's enjoyment, compatible with Rock Band instruments.
4286189	4286809	Thank God.
4287750	4290571	And the Wii U version, of course, does not have instruments at all.
4291011	4294272	And it's actually got a video out there for it, too, on how you play it.
4294292	4295132	It's kind of interesting.
4296353	4296433	Um...
4297816	4298597	Let's see here.
4299538	4305104	Then there was also one of the things was the SBGs, which is server-based gaming.
4305885	4317677	And apparently it's going to be like a social networking blade or something like that that allow you to play games from game shows like Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and other things like that.
4318358	4319840	So that's kind of interesting.
4321799	4332802	And finally, Powers and Titans, which is a multiplayer superhero game that's apparently going to be something that Joss Whedon is going to be a part of.
4333282	4333642	Woohoo!
4333942	4339323	So, I don't know what exactly that is, but probably some sort of superhero game.
4339483	4340344	Actually, I'm mad at him.
4341084	4341284	Why?
4341464	4341644	Why?
4341864	4343304	For the end of Astonishing X-Men.
4345285	4345765	Okay.
4346365	4346985	You'll get over it.
4348426	4349506	Oh no, you don't, that, no.
4351058	4361325	And finally, in unrelated news, you may remember the Wii Fit girl who's been kind of floating around.
4361946	4364708	She had the YouTube video where she shook her ass while playing Wii Fit.
4364828	4365028	Yes.
4365168	4371753	Well, Playboy's Joe Garcia has put out her own videos that are a little bit more seductive.
4372353	4373954	Also her playing Wii Fit as well.
4374334	4375295	Trying to cash in on that.
4375375	4375655	Nice.
4377296	4381919	Boy, you know we've moved into a new generation where people are trying to cash in on other people's YouTube videos.
4382259	4382860	It's amazing.
4384121	4384841	Absolutely amazing.
4385221	4388863	Yeah, so... Alright, awesome.
4391550	4393511	Loki will review those videos next week on the show.
4394932	4397513	I don't know if there's... Well, it didn't look that interesting.
4397533	4399474	It didn't look that interesting?
4399494	4400935	She doesn't get naked, okay?
4401055	4405118	I mean, this is a Playboy little pictorial thing that she does not get naked.
4405418	4406719	I do not approve of that.
4406739	4407079	Fine.
4407739	4411621	But I do approve of people taking it to the next step.
4412122	4412462	Alright.
4414683	4417345	To which I say, Wii Fit Girl, your rebuttal?
4419629	4426774	If that's going to do it for our last minute stories tonight, I guess we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show and bring another week of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
4426834	4431757	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, our sixth anniversary show, if you can believe it.
4432738	4433899	But nothing too special going on.
4433939	4434840	Same old shit we always do.
4435500	4436120	Hopefully some guests.
4436761	4438182	No one's made any suggestions.
4438382	4439843	Miglitov will be here next week.
4440103	4441083	I should get my husband here.
4441244	4442284	So we'll at least have him.
4442884	4445886	I was trying, by the way, I was trying to get one story we didn't get to tonight.
4445906	4446807	I don't know if you read this.
4447727	4453690	Did you read on the gaming blogs this week about that lady who's running for state senate in Connecticut?
4454110	4459273	And how it's like this big deal like, oh, politicians are getting into games because she has a level 70 in World of Warcraft?
4459653	4460574	Did you see that story?
4462676	4468040	I don't know if you thought of this, but the minute I read that, I'm like, what's the big freaking deal?
4468100	4473465	My boyfriend ran for state senate in 2006, and he has two level 70s in Warcraft.
4474126	4477128	I was actually trying to get him to come to the show tonight, but he didn't want to.
4477909	4479470	He didn't know what he'd say.
4480231	4483434	He was like, what would I talk about if I went on your show?
4483454	4485876	I'm like, you play more World of Warcraft than I do.
4485976	4486517	You'd fit in fine.
4486537	4491301	Whenever you see a story like that, you just have to think of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.
4491601	4491982	I'm hip.
4492142	4492562	I'm cool.
4497222	4497402	Yeah.
4497982	4499383	But I'm just saying, you know what?
4499443	4502745	Politicians come in all different flavors, just like regular people.
4502785	4505886	Why does it matter what your job is and what you like to do in your spare time?
4505906	4506346	For real.
4506567	4506827	For real.
4506867	4508427	Who the hell cares?
4508748	4512689	And what relevance does your gaming life have on your political views?
4512710	4513470	Well, hold on.
4513490	4513810	To be fair.
4515911	4517112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4540583	4544666	But I just don't see what, you know, what you like to do as a hobby.
4545127	4549250	Unless, you know, you like to, you know, skin kittens in your backyard or something.
4550351	4550952	As a hobby.
4551252	4551412	Yeah.
4551452	4553814	You know, but you play video games.
4554234	4555055	What's the problem?
4555255	4555735	Who cares?
4556196	4556436	I know.
4556496	4561420	You know, it's like, you know, I don't care what people's bedroom habits are.
4561560	4563041	I don't care what their gaming habits are.
4563662	4568806	You know, as long as they're not hurting anybody, what does it matter, right?
4568826	4569347	Right.
4569367	4569607	Right.
4571420	4573542	and people piss me off.
4574723	4592279	By the way, speaking of not caring about what goes on behind closed doors, I do want to say, though, a very happy day tomorrow, Monday, June 15th and going on into June 16th to all the new couples who will be getting married in California who finally, finally have equality.
4594301	4595122	It's so amazing.
4595142	4596763	I'm so happy to live in a state where that's going to be happening.
4596783	4597564	Until they overrule it again.
4598209	4598769	You know what?
4599570	4600730	Not if I have anything to say about it.
4601110	4607554	Well, did you hear from Amanda about... Um, no.
4607574	4609274	There's a chapel open up now.
4610095	4611335	Did that actually happen?
4611355	4612456	I saw the website.
4612556	4614837	I know the friend was talking about opening one in the Castro.
4614857	4615617	Did that actually happen?
4615637	4616318	I think so.
4616498	4617398	Oh my god.
4618099	4618879	We'll have to get a link from her.
4619625	4621486	Wow, that's great if that actually happened, huh?
4621826	4622507	But you know what?
4622607	4629651	I honestly think that, you know, eventually, and I think that more and more people are realizing this, that what does it matter?
4629992	4637116	I mean, and personally, and I've had this discussion with other people before, I actually think that marriage should not be a government thing.
4638115	4639196	Institution, you know what I mean?
4639316	4641858	Well, thankfully, and boy, we got off the topic of video games.
4641878	4642798	That's all right.
4642838	4644039	No, that's all right.
4644079	4645800	It's a topic that's important to me, so you know what?
4645840	4646061	Deal.
4647962	4653206	Thankfully, the youth of America does not have their head up their ass in this regard.
4653226	4653886	For the majority?
4654146	4655587	In this regard, yeah, the majority.
4656528	4658569	I still know people who have their head up their ass.
4658669	4662092	Yeah, there's always going to be somebody with their head up their ass, but it makes me very hopeful for the future.
4662552	4662832	Yeah.
4662912	4663773	Very hopeful for the future.
4664333	4666194	Alright, I was going to say one thing.
4666254	4667836	I'm sorry, I missed one last thing.
4668576	4670437	Yeah, yeah.
4670457	4673099	This is actually coming from our friends over at Bawani Style.
4673820	4687188	Apparently there was an MTV pack or an advertisement for Rock Band that they were showing a bunch of songs kind of scrolling through the song list and lo and behold, there's a bunch of songs that haven't come out yet in there.
4687809	4691511	So, four songs that they spotted on there.
4691952	4693833	The Aesthetics of Hate by Machine Head.
4694573	4716965	uh afterlife by avenge sevenfold which i believe is coming out this next week um breed by nirvana and burn by nine inch nails sweet sounds like fun and i i was gonna say uh i think there's a couple other stories that they had too there was something about like uh new ddr or something like that um also some um
4718479	4719199	Beatin' Groovy
4742133	4742894	is what it's called.
4743374	4746797	It's an E-rated Konami-published title.
4747357	4751461	It says, from the sound of it, it sounds like Konami's rhythm game, of course.
4753582	4758286	It was found on Australia's ratings board webpage.
4759487	4768495	There is also another Xbox 360 title, Domino Master, which is supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
4768515	4770156	I wonder if that's Mr. Domino, because that'd be funny.
4773920	4782184	Alright, now that we've had the last, last, last minute stories, let's go ahead and wrap up the show.
4783284	4784485	We got all the final thoughts.
4784845	4786406	We got the last, last minute story.
4786486	4788526	And you know, Ultimate Band has Miley Cyrus in it.
4789167	4790127	Because it's a Disney title.
4791048	4792108	Oh my god, so I was right.
4792168	4793089	It has Hannah Montana in it.
4794749	4795730	I have ESPN.
4797751	4799471	Isn't Dolly Parton her godmother?
4800312	4800712	I think so.
4801308	4801770	That's cool.
4802333	4803057	I like Dolly Parton.
4803660	4805248	I don't like Hannah Montana, but I like Dolly Parton.
4806145	4809968	Before we get out of here tonight, we have one more thing we wanted to play for you guys.
4810048	4811709	It came up in the email earlier.
4811829	4814571	It was what Katamaris Forever emailed us, right?
4815272	4822917	And sent us the parody of Still Alive, but it's featuring the OLR-themed lyrics.
4823217	4825959	So we're actually going to play that for the listeners before we sign off tonight.
4825999	4828461	So here it is, and then we're going to be out of here.
4828881	4833204	So a big thanks to Katamaris Forever and all the fans who got together to make the lyrics.
4833264	4833985	I can't wait to hear this.
4834005	4834265	Here you go.
4834687	4848490	This was a triumph I'm making a flood here, brah brah brah It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
4850931	4879687	Orange Launch Radio We podcast the news because we can For the laws in all of us Except the ones who are banned But there's no sense crying over every darn show You just keep on talking till you're out of FU The podcast that's done and she makes a bad pun For the people who are still tuned in
4890783	4908861	I'm being so sincere right now Even though some stupid kid shot someone And tore him to pieces And dug every piece into the ground
4911587	4930084	They decayed and Rob gave him a big fat stupid award Now the spears of earth make a beautiful shine The whole thing isn't in the podcast on time But I'm five miles by six, so the podcast's here quick For the people who watch
4942641	4956231	Yay, Nomar Live, 365 The sound on here is great and we just know it But is it a stereo?
4958472	4971662	That was a joke, haha, mono Jamie's eating puss grumpy, but then again it's not me Look at us still singing when there's news to read
4973308	4979611	I'm doing podcasts with the 365 We're here on all games, not 365 And while you're dying, you'll know 365
5000620	5007477	Podcast of the year, we are gonna strive, gonna strive, gonna strive
5009178	5010959	Yay, nice job.
5011039	5011799	That was cool.
5011819	5012359	That was very cool.
5012539	5015521	It was a little hard to hear the voice, but that's okay.
5015621	5018182	I think on headphones it'll come out a lot better.
5018302	5020043	I think it'll be easier to hear on headphones.
5020403	5023744	But nice job and very, very flattering nevertheless.
5024244	5028126	So thank you very much for that, and thank you to everybody who was involved with that.
5028706	5031467	Okay, now I think we can end the show.
5031548	5034849	So thank you very much for supporting independent podcasting as you always do.
5035229	5046078	Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program and help spread the word because we don't have any big magazine or website backing us, so we rely on word of mouth to get the word out.
5046499	5048180	We do this for free because we heart you.
5048480	5051022	So we'll see you next week for our sixth anniversary show.
5051042	5052284	That's going to do it for another OLR.
5052304	5052564	Good night.
5053097	5053617	See you next week!
5083912	5084685	Thanks for watching!
