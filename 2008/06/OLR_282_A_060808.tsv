71479	75784	Tonight, June 8th, 2008, could Microsoft really be going Blu-ray?
76144	76925	Another Star Wars
89520	93262	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
93322	100267	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and wait for it, the gamer lifestyle.
100687	106631	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, DarkSakura, aka Jamie Summers.
106871	107251	Hi.
107492	108032	Hi, how are you?
109333	109653	I'm here.
110066	110486	You're here.
111087	111707	You are here.
111967	112708	Wherever here is.
112808	114249	Here is in Sacramento, California.
114269	115149	That's the home base.
115470	116390	Technically.
116470	116971	Technically.
117111	118372	We are not in Sacramento.
118392	120753	Yeah, we're in a suburb called Rancho Cordova, but who cares?
121414	123235	Does Tech Master Loki care?
123495	124576	Our other co-host here tonight?
125036	126537	Yeah, it's hot in here.
126877	127858	It is very hot in here.
127898	133922	Unfortunately, it's getting to be hotter and hotter as time goes on.
134522	134742	Yeah.
135203	135503	All right.
136932	142214	Alright, well, we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of How was your gaming week?
142274	143915	And then we're going to get into some gaming news.
143975	146096	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
146416	149717	I got an EB Mania 2DX controller for $8.
150857	151678	Eight whole dollars?
152018	152858	Eight whole dollars.
154219	158280	And Dan showed me some game called I Want to Be the Guy.
161081	164323	It was a YouTube video of someone playing it, which I thought was kind of funny.
164363	164843	It was like...
166579	171802	Supposedly this really hard game that has elements from different other games in it, so I'd have to do a little bit more research.
172622	174883	I think I saw this game a couple weeks ago.
174983	176424	It's interesting.
177165	177965	To say the least.
178505	178725	Yes.
180906	184088	And just more of the usual.
185769	186149	Alright.
186669	187350	More of the usual.
187430	188230	Same old, same old.
189011	189991	Loki, how was your gaming week?
190471	191092	It was okay.
192588	193828	Of course, more Grand Theft Auto 4.
194088	197829	I'm actually at 98.66% of completion.
197869	198829	In fact, I'll be done with it.
198849	202170	Too bad it's not 98.666 because that would be funny.
202650	202850	Yes.
204950	206210	And then, let's see here.
207951	212632	Also, I've been playing actually a little bit of some different stuff.
212732	218933	We tried some things last night over at my mom's house during Nelly's birthday barbecue.
218953	218993	We...
220874	225036	Try it a little bit, very, very little bit of Dancing with the Stars.
225336	227677	That game sucked balls, so we immediately turned that off.
229037	236020	Actually played quite a bit of Defend Your Castle, and that game, and I think with four people, that game would be a lot of fun.
236760	238381	I was only playing it with my sister, though, but...
239591	240832	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
263135	265957	I guess the controls of it are very similar to Excite Truck.
266637	290391	You can actually hold the remote either flat with the buttons facing up kind of like Excite Truck or you can put it in the Wii wheel and have the buttons facing towards you and you can actually calibrate that by the very beginning of the game they actually ask you to hold the controller horizontal and you hit the 2 button on there and that will basically cause you to
292385	293305	Calibrate it, either way.
293466	294246	So it's pretty awesome.
294266	308177	I like how they do that, because a lot of these games now are using the Wii wheel, and so it's forcing you to keep the buttons towards you, and that's fine if you're using the Wii wheel, but if you're not, it really contorts your wrist when you're trying to play it, and it kind of hurts after a while, which kind of sucks.
308978	309579	The other thing...
310419	312341	I mean, the game itself is pretty fun.
312381	316244	It's actually quite a bit like Wipeout, a little bit like F-Zero.
316564	319786	The graphics could be a little bit better, but overall, it's fun.
319846	324750	You can do all the Car-Fu stuff in there, and very intuitive controls, and I don't know.
324810	328533	Right now, Nelly is calling this her next Excite Truck game.
328553	329974	She is literally playing this at home right now.
329994	332476	That's a big endorsement from the wife who usually hates video games.
332616	337520	Exactly, and I've tried finding a suitable replacement for Excite Truck, and
338140	341924	Have failed so far until now, but I think it's pretty cool.
342424	352935	I wish this game had come out on a different platform, like say the 360 or PlayStation 3, because the movie was so pretty, and the game is just kind of, it's all right.
354369	378816	but a couple things you may have noticed if you've ever seen any of the trailer videos on this that there's a lot of kind of silhouette pop-ups that come up and they like say a little one-liner thing and then they pop away and it does that very frequently you can turn those off so if that's annoying because I know a lot of people are like well what the fuck that's really stupid looking you can turn all that stuff off so that's really cool but that's about it yeah it's fun game though
380783	381984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
407455	408296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
426795	427576	Defend Your Castle.
427616	428437	It's a WiiWare game.
428737	430599	I haven't played much Wii lately.
430639	431820	I'll have to show it to you at some point.
431860	432101	It's fun.
432901	434843	It's based on an old, old Flash game.
434964	437286	I think it's called the same thing, Defend Your Castle.
437586	438387	It's very similar.
438607	440529	But it was much bloodier in the Flash version.
440569	444594	They had to, you know, Wii-itize it or whatever you want to call it.
446470	447471	I like the style.
447631	455497	And if you notice, also, just like that gummy car game or whatever they had, it's all done with the guy's voice.
456358	457218	Yes, I love it.
457238	458099	His voice is great.
459881	461182	That's like the music in the game.
461222	462763	It's great.
462883	467146	Games I played this week, lots and lots of World of Warcraft because I'm kind of addicted.
468550	471993	But I did check out a couple of the new arcade games on Xbox Live.
472013	476657	These are demos only, so I'm really basing my opinion off demos, which, you know, just kind of a disclaimer there.
476997	479660	Ace of the Galaxy, I don't know.
480100	480981	I played it for a little while.
481021	481882	It was kind of interesting.
482182	488027	The shooting style of it reminded me a little bit of Rez, where you could, like, lock onto things and let all your bullets go off at once.
488787	492371	But then I go, you know, I'm kind of playing it, and I'm just like, I just want to play Rez.
492731	494412	I want to play a game like this.
495393	496675	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
512774	513735	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
532512	537953	Turn these little disks as fast as you can to make sure the shapes, as they fall, fall through the right shape.
538473	541954	You remember that old, old game like we had in elementary school called Perfection?
542314	547635	Where you had to put those little shapes in the right holes before, pop, they all pop out, like, remember, before the board explodes?
548115	548315	Right?
548355	548995	You ever play that game?
549175	550015	Am I the only one that played that?
550035	550655	I used to play it.
550715	551495	I think it was awesome.
551535	552095	Okay, thank God.
552375	552595	All right.
553376	554156	It's kind of like that.
554296	561557	You want to make sure you turn the disks so that a star shape throws to the star hole repeatedly or else the galaxy blows up.
562746	563212	Basically.
564537	565097	In a nutshell.
565537	579020	But I couldn't figure out how was this game going to... I mean, granted, as it was going along, it added more shapes, and it got a little harder, and you had to squash these aliens by speeding the bricks up, but it was still about reaction time.
579380	581500	I was kind of like, where is the puzzle game in this?
581620	584881	If there's a puzzle game here, the demo totally neglected to show it to me.
584901	587801	You have to understand, if there's objects falling down on a screen, it's a puzzle game.
588281	589881	I guess, but not to me.
590041	592682	So I wasn't very impressed.
594483	600526	Which is a darn shame because the graphics and previews for the future levels made it look like more exciting things were to come.
601026	601367	I don't know.
601907	606530	Maybe I'll have to look it up on the internet and see if there's videos of future levels that make the game more interesting.
606550	608351	Because, I mean, it did hold my attention.
608371	610011	I was like, whee, rotating discs is fun.
610052	610732	This game is easy.
610772	612113	I bet it could get lots of achievement points.
612153	614594	But then, like, when the demo was over, I was like, that's it?
615615	615955	That's it?
618586	620267	Those are the two new games I played this week.
621407	622908	Otherwise, I've been playing more Audio Surface.
622948	624028	Well, that game's pretty rad.
624048	626729	I talked about that on last week's show, if you missed that.
626749	631731	All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here shortly, but I also want to introduce the one and only chat room.
631771	634512	It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
635012	638593	Gerardimo in chat says, Rugu equals the baby toy for adults.
639514	639954	Kind of.
640314	643335	Gerardimo also says, Rugu equals boring a lot.
644894	647016	AJ Mix has been playing a lot of Wii in his week.
647036	652382	He's been playing Dr. Mario on WiiWare, Battalion Wars Wii, Bomberman Live on Wii, and Mario Paint on the Super Nintendo.
653002	653603	That's old school.
654283	656145	Anybody checked out Dr. Mario on WiiWare yet?
656165	659669	That's one of those games I keep like, I need to get it, but I have no space!
660309	664253	No, this is just like, remember how Nintendo said, oh, we have 100 WiiWare games in development.
664613	667096	Yeah, they're all gonna be fucking old clones of shit.
667596	668898	And then they're gonna put Dr. Mario out there.
668958	669218	Just put
670199	673142	But, hold on, to be fair, Nintendo is the master.
673322	674143	No one does it better.
674403	677566	Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again.
678087	680689	Case in point, Mario All-Stars on Super Nintendo.
680709	681510	Who didn't love that game?
681690	684393	Because it was like the upgraded versions of the old Mario games.
685034	686916	Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again.
687516	688457	And they do a good job of it.
690239	692081	Maybe that was a little fanboyish statement, but they do...
694726	697188	I have to ask about this before we get into housekeeping tonight.
697348	700571	I'm going to address why there's been changes on JustinTV.
700891	701752	We'll get to that in a minute.
702572	703453	First, I want to ask Loki.
703513	704654	Loki ran through the door.
706380	707941	Rob, I'm gonna be late, there's food problems.
733647	735309	Thanks for watching!
753611	756133	Uh, I forgot to put the breadsticks in.
756573	758615	Okay, so they put them in, but they only put in half of my order.
759195	760436	Uh, I forgot to put the other half in.
761036	763178	So, you know, I'm just sitting there and... Nice.
763578	769902	And the guy, you know, up front, working cash register, had his mouth open, kind of drooling there.
770582	774265	And some guy's like, um, is my pizza ready?
774845	777287	I called it in, he said it was going to be 20 minutes, and it's been 25.
777327	777387	Uh...
782610	784551	So, can you check on it?
784811	789494	Well, she said that it's going to be about five minutes once you've ordered it.
790254	790694	What do you mean?
791695	791915	What?
792956	794096	Oh, well, they just put it in.
795897	796637	Can you go check on that?
797698	799379	He's just stupid to stand in there.
800006	804891	I love how food emergencies are a valid excuse here at Orange Lawn Studio for making a person wait.
805652	807834	I had plenty of time.
808655	811438	Even with a slight delay, I would have still been here on time.
811738	814601	But it was like fucking 40 minutes for breadsticks.
814701	816463	That shit takes like two minutes to make.
816703	817083	Alright.
818044	820285	Let's talk about Justin TV and housekeeping tonight.
820305	822225	We've changed a little bit over on Justin TV.
822265	822825	Here's what happened.
823165	828046	We used to run through an iSight webcam and my little Mac laptop.
828326	835368	We used to run the webcam that way, but the iSight got broken due to my stupidness, and it no longer runs audio through it.
835708	840649	So what happened is that this past week, I actually got a video camera because I've been wanting a video camera anyway, so...
841489	843070	Just figured two birds with one stone.
843110	845591	I'm going to get a video camera and we're going to use it for Justin.TV as well.
845891	847031	So that's what you see hooked up tonight.
847051	849672	We actually have now a video camera running on Justin.TV.
849972	851993	However, here's why the resolution is crappy.
852273	861096	Because for some reason, even though the old Justin.TV broadcaster used to support 640x480 on the USB capture device, it no longer does that.
861496	862057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
878699	880441	All we have to do is make a little switch just like this.
901960	921173	and you guys won't hear this on the podcast but they'll see it on Justin TV you can actually go to live video of gameplay and playing right now on Justin TV is our old favorite 8-bit classic The Guardian Legend a little screenshot from there and you'll be able to see us kind of switch back and forth so we can actually like if we talk about games and we happen to have them up we can switch just that easily
922267	927651	Now here's the other problem, is that on Justin TV just then, their audio completely cut out.
927691	929673	They only got the audio of the game.
929713	931374	They didn't hear us talking over that.
931655	933876	So that's the other thing we've got to fix, but we're working on it.
934677	940922	Exciting things to come on Justin TV, but since you guys have been crying the past few weeks, like, where's the webcam gone?
941222	942784	I want to show you we've made some progress.
943564	944105	We're trying.
944785	947347	We are a non-profit organization here at Orange Lounge Radio.
947367	948108	Okay?
948929	949189	All right.
951195	955358	All right, so anyhow, let's get into tonight's gaming news, shall we?
955399	959922	If there's no other housekeeping tonight, the only other thing I can think of is the old plugs for our communities.
959962	966908	We love to add people on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio, on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge, or our Facebook community, the OL Army.
967609	969050	Let's get to tonight's gaming news, Loki.
969370	971852	There's also the Orange Lounge Wiki at Wikia.
972152	973333	Oh, that thing is awesome, too.
974334	975795	This is how awesome our community is.
976736	978397	I put out a call on the forums this week.
978437	981298	I'm like, hi, I don't know anything about editing wikis.
981418	982799	I'm not very good at it at all.
982899	984099	I don't know the wiki language.
984259	986020	I think wiki is a wonderful concept.
986060	989301	I need to take my lazy ass and sit it down for a while and learn wiki.
989581	992042	But the front page on the wiki right now isn't working for me.
992222	993383	I can't find things.
993663	996684	Can someone please clean up the front page within 24 hours?
997085	997585	It looks great.
998345	999046	Thank you for watching!
1009235	1009635	All right.
1009856	1031474	Well, this is a rumor that never seems to die, but CrunchGear, a tech blog, is actually reporting that an inside source at Microsoft, who was a former member of the company's HD DVD department, has confirmed that the company will announce that the Xbox 360 will get Blu-ray before Christmas via a press release that's set to go out tomorrow morning around 9, 10-ish.
1031554	1031694	Wow.
1034710	1041898	Apparently the system, they don't really have any info on it right now, but it says it will cost less than an elite system.
1042679	1049547	So, I don't know, this still seems far-fetched, but I guess we'll just have to wait until tomorrow morning now, won't we?
1052011	1055593	Well, which will be today by the time this show goes out.
1055693	1060316	So, you know, either we were really smart in saying this in advance or we're dumb.
1060877	1065300	But it seems like this rumor is always going around that Microsoft is going to be announcing Blu-ray.
1065380	1067061	What makes this special?
1067301	1074146	All I think that they're going to be doing with this is just releasing another external thing that's going to have, you know, just like the HD DVD player.
1075939	1076159	and so on.
1102873	1104694	I think that's what they're probably going to have to do with this.
1104975	1109097	If they do include it inside of a 360, I think it's going to be a dumb move.
1109718	1118224	Hopefully, I mean, I hope they tested all this stuff to make sure that the access times are the same because otherwise you're going to have a lot of problems reading games.
1118284	1120946	What is it about this particular report though why I should believe it?
1122014	1122354	I don't know.
1122934	1135180	I think those people are just... Because I think that instead of just saying, you know, oh, it's coming, it's saying, hey, there's going to be a press release tomorrow that says da-da-da-da-da at this time.
1135300	1140002	So it's a lot easier to say, okay, well, this is going to be true or false instead of speculating whether it's true or not.
1140743	1143684	Now, GK128 in our chat makes an interesting observation.
1143724	1147486	He says the new iPhone is supposed to be tomorrow as well, which, you know, that's...
1148106	1154071	Half speculation, half Apple fanboys always figure out this stuff in advance, so they're probably right.
1155252	1156012	Well, here's the thing.
1156092	1158514	Tomorrow is the Worldwide Developers Conference.
1158534	1161076	So is this Microsoft's answer to Apple, in a way?
1161116	1164619	Like, hey, Apple's making this big unveiling, and we're going to unveil Blu-ray in the home.
1164859	1166100	Is that what maybe gives us a little weight?
1166240	1166661	Maybe.
1166761	1167221	I don't know.
1167261	1167942	It'd just be weird.
1168982	1173366	Unless, you know, Microsoft, I mean, they're always kind of butting heads with Apple and stuff.
1173446	1174167	Maybe they're trying to...
1175051	1178812	Get people on board with their video download service and stuff like that.
1179795	1180135	I don't know.
1180676	1181897	And you put the nail on the head there.
1181937	1184058	Why would they want to go Blu-ray when they have their download service?
1184198	1186560	I mean, but then again, alright, they have the HD DVD player.
1186881	1197269	And to be honest, I guess when I hear about Microsoft putting out a Blu-ray player, you remember in the old Charlie Brown comics, when a character would get really upset, there'd be a little scribble drawn over their head?
1197729	1204675	That's what I look like when I keep thinking about how my HD DVD player, pretty much, I only have five movies I'll ever be able to watch on it now.
1205135	1207617	We can still find movies all over the place, though.
1208177	1208898	Usually really cheap.
1209718	1213560	But to know that there's no more ever coming out in some of these newer movies I might want to get.
1213680	1215001	Well, we found out they were clearing out.
1215041	1216001	We went out and bought our player.
1217882	1219543	But I bought my player full price.
1219803	1223524	That's why I have angry, angry face.
1223564	1227026	There are always positives and negatives to adopting early.
1227666	1228907	I know, I know, I know.
1229007	1229627	It just sucks.
1230227	1231028	Wah, sucks.
1231788	1232068	All right.
1232208	1233549	But keep in mind, you know.
1234660	1256214	Blu-ray being now the preferred method of high definition media I'm expecting now to start seeing more of the less expensive models coming out over the next year or so so you'll have an easier time getting one into your hands all the more reason not to buy this
1258499	1258819	I don't know.
1258879	1262221	Well, I'm not going to buy the Blu-ray player because I know eventually I'm going to get a PS3.
1262501	1266943	I realize I'm the only OLR host without a PS3, and eventually I'm going to crack and get one.
1266963	1267483	You aren't missing much.
1268243	1272005	Well, right now I'm not, but Final Fantasy XIII is going to come out someday.
1272825	1273666	Look how we think.
1274186	1275807	I am a Final Fantasy fanboy.
1275927	1278568	I will be the first to admit when it comes out, I have no choice.
1278668	1279648	I must upgrade to PS3.
1279908	1282289	Even if the game sucks, it's Final Fantasy.
1282550	1283510	I have to get it.
1283630	1285271	Did the same thing for Final Fantasy VII.
1286913	1309144	and I held out on getting a Sony Playstation for the longest time until Final Fantasy 7 came out and then I finally caved and bought one and I'm glad I did because you guys all know tons and tons of classic games on the Playstation I hope the Playstation 3 has a similar legacy but I don't know we'll see Ranma in chat agrees Rob you're not missing anything hey before we get to the next story I missed one housekeeping thing I'm such a jerk
1310166	1310407	DJ Tetsuya
1326428	1327308	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1354280	1359863	I'm sure as you read, they sent me the console instead because they knew I was the appropriate owner of such a console.
1359903	1360464	Lies, lies.
1360724	1361684	But I do have some good news.
1362124	1364125	SSJ100Matt did tie for third place.
1364786	1365806	So he does get something.
1365866	1366847	So that does kind of rock.
1366867	1367727	So congratulations.
1369449	1370309	Thank you for watching!
1391692	1396355	Only one vote got SSJ100 Matt tied for third place because Bobby's show got like four votes.
1396515	1397916	I mean, it was a runaway.
1398156	1401198	But do you know which show voted for us out of everybody?
1402819	1403119	Bobby.
1405200	1408042	Because Bobby's the only one that probably understood all the in-jokes.
1410114	1410694	That's great.
1411515	1413196	So the winning show voted for us.
1413336	1415677	I don't know what that says, but something to think about.
1416317	1417138	Something to think about.
1417638	1417958	All right.
1418878	1420139	Let's move on to more news.
1420379	1424761	And something else we like to think about are music-based games because you know we love them here.
1424801	1428463	And lately music-based games have been all about Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
1428523	1430384	And a brand new Guitar Hero game is coming out.
1430424	1432465	If you haven't heard, it's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
1432925	1435127	Guitar Hero Aerosmith is scheduled to come out very soon.
1435567	1438928	And there are some songs that have been announced for the game.
1439149	1439829	I'm disappointed.
1440677	1441417	I want Foghat Edition.
1468773	1473418	Live on the Edge, Love in an Elevator, Dream On, Walk This Way, Run DMC
1489693	1490914	and some of the other bands you'll see.
1491194	1501661	Cheap Trick with Dream Police, Joan Jett, I Hate Myself for Loving You, The Clash, Complete Control, Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run and Run DMC with King of Rock.
1502301	1509646	So that's some of the stuff you have to look forward to in Guitar Hero Aerosmith which is coming out for the PlayStation 3, 360 and PlayStation 2.
1510347	1512448	And if just the game wasn't enough, wouldn't you know it?
1512929	1514349	Bundles coming out as well.
1514790	1519613	So no excuses to say you can't play this game unless you just don't like Guitar Hero or Aerosmith.
1520834	1521514	I like Aerosmith
1544687	1545487	DarkSakura Reads The Next Story
1575387	1578109	The next story has to do with something that rather excites me.
1579690	1585155	One of my favorite game series ever, and I'm not saying Metal Slug, but it's Samurai Shodown.
1586396	1597264	They actually said that, well, from the ESRB, that Xbox Live Arcade would be getting Samurai Shodown 2, and also now they're saying they should be getting Samurai Shodown, and it's...
1598525	1606771	I suppose they're getting them separately, but there's no news beyond what's been on the ESRB.
1606911	1611075	So we can hope that they'll be all jazzed up and pretty.
1612656	1614737	Are we going to get all the Samurai Shodown games?
1614757	1615598	Because that's kind of a lot.
1615618	1616118	I want five.
1616979	1618180	What's so special about five?
1618700	1623164	Five is the last cartridge that was released on the Neo Geo cart system.
1623944	1625045	And I've never played it.
1625606	1626106	And I want it.
1627998	1630521	Fuck it, I want Samurai Shodown HD Remix.
1630842	1632925	Or you can do Samurai Shodown 5 HD Remix.
1633525	1637290	I want Samurai Shodown 2 though, most of all, because that one was like the best.
1638712	1638933	Huh.
1639393	1640535	It had caffeine nicotine.
1643138	1643379	Nice.
1645319	1649402	Going back to the question that we asked earlier, Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
1649442	1649762	Let's see.
1650383	1653185	Kitsune says, I'm not too thrilled about the new Guitar Hero.
1653666	1656168	AJ Mix says, it's not Guitar Hero Blink 182.
1657709	1660271	Kitsune follows up and says, I think my husband might get it for the 360.
1662413	1665616	Robert M says, I still can't find many of the Aerosmith songs on iTunes.
1666396	1668438	Gerardimo says, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, why?
1668518	1669979	Because Guitar Hero makes it money.
1671986	1674628	GS68 is hoping for Guitar Hero Loki Fusion
1696122	1696843	Last couple comments.
1696883	1705369	GK128 says, Guitar Hero, insert band name here, will always be a rental unless it's something badass like Pixies or Dinosaur Jr., which he must be fanboys of.
1706950	1708952	Frisbee says, make Aerosmith a download pack.
1709472	1713195	And AZHP says, it'd only be worth it if you actually like Aerosmith.
1713275	1714355	Aerosmith's kind of cool, though.
1714456	1715756	See, that's what I'm talking about.
1716457	1718839	Rock Band has it figured out with the download packs.
1718859	1722361	The problem they're going to run into with that, though, is what they do for Rock Band 2.
1723642	1745113	And that's how they could sell more Guitar Hero Aerosmiths, is by saying, okay, well, all those download songs that you had will be compatible with this game, or you can download more, you know, and have them compatible with both games.
1745613	1748915	That would be smart, which is why they're not going to do it.
1749929	1753236	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, this is what we need, Guitar Hero F-Zero.
1754279	1756804	I'm not sure how that would work, but it sounds good in theory.
1758331	1765356	It would be just like, you know, the rock band commercial where they're on top of the bus, you know, playing their music, but on top of an F-Zero.
1765376	1766677	That's the intro to the game, isn't it?
1766897	1767777	F-Zero car.
1767957	1768358	What's that?
1768438	1769619	That's the intro to the game.
1770039	1773301	I know, I know, but still, that would be Guitar Hero F-Zero.
1773361	1777544	It's, you know, playing music really fast on a really, really, really fast car flying through the air.
1777704	1787711	Or maybe instead of like that normal note track you have, you're actually on a car that's racing down one of those super fast F-Zero tracks doing loops and stuff, and you have to read the notes off that.
1788291	1788951	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1818555	1819878	Yeah, that would be great!
1819958	1823746	Where you get more points if you scream out, listen to my song, dammit.
1824628	1824989	There you go.
1825350	1827554	Yeah, for those of us who are familiar with Micross 7.
1829410	1831071	All the mechs were based around music.
1831631	1835834	Rob, one of the biggest points in Macross was that music had a lot of power.
1836234	1839076	Which was how, in the very first series, spoiler!
1839296	1845460	You know, 20 years later, how in the first series they defeated the enemies that came by was because of stupid butthead minmei.
1846501	1850744	And so, Macross 7 is sort of a big playoff of the whole music is power thing, so...
1851943	1879092	I gotta tell you though, going back to F-Zero for a minute I was tempted this week to actually put in F-Zero GX and play it a little bit Because it's still one of my favorite racers And I think I said this over on Bobby's show when we were doing the tees tonight There aren't a lot of racing games I really like outside of F-Zero Because F-Zero is fast and it's horrifically simple That's what I like in a racing game I don't like all the complications I like Burnout because Burnout's fast too and it has explosions There's not a lot of racing games I really, really love They made a Burnout arcade game, that'd be pretty awesome That'd be pretty awesome
1880255	1881375	All right, let's move on with more news.
1884556	1896420	So, of course, me being a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto was a little bit disappointed to hear that the Grand Theft Auto download content that's been promised for me has been delayed to fiscal quarter one 2009.
1898241	1898941	What's that mean?
1899201	1902462	Well, that means that it's due between November 1st, 2008 and January 31st, 2009.
1905723	1907523	which, when you look at it, it's not really that bad anyways.
1907744	1913805	But, hey, still though, I wish it was out a little bit sooner because, you know, I'm being... Because sooner is better!
1913965	1914465	Exactly!
1914605	1919707	And because, you know, now that I'm almost done with the game, you know, I need more achievements.
1920247	1921767	And also, I need more stuff to do.
1922307	1923308	I hope they add tanks.
1923868	1924828	What about multiplayer?
1924868	1926388	Isn't multiplayer thrilling enough for you?
1926628	1927609	Multiplayer is fun.
1927629	1927669	Um...
1930055	1931196	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1958976	1959256	I don't know.
1959416	1961258	That's a really in-depth message.
1962078	1965701	Yeah, hey, you know, I was surprised to see that pop up too.
1965761	1967843	But, you know, that's just how they roll.
1967923	1969644	So, yeah.
1970485	1973047	It's alright though because if the download content comes out later...
1973581	1974242	Loki, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1994139	1995240	I didn't watch the new trailer.
1995260	1995960	What's so great about it?
1996440	2000262	The whole trailer was comparing Grand Theft Auto 4 with Saints Row 2.
2000982	2005064	It was a trailer highlighting the side missions you can do in the game.
2005424	2012808	The side stuff you can do in Grand Theft Auto 4, they have bowling and playing pool and darts and stuff like that.
2013368	2013969	Hey, you know what?
2032483	2035665	Me being a fan of both games, both are great in their own aspects.
2036066	2036806	They're just different.
2036906	2039548	It's like Star Wars and Spaceballs.
2040028	2041269	So competition is healthy.
2041750	2042710	Exactly.
2042890	2048294	I'm glad to see, because a lot of the stuff that came from Saints Row ended up making it into Grand Theft Auto 4.
2048334	2048614	The whole...
2052150	2058952	Their navigation systems, pretty much the same as Saints Row, using the cell phone for all the cheats and stuff like that.
2059593	2060813	A lot from Saints Row.
2062313	2067095	Just the multiplayer, probably pushed them a little bit more to do multiplayer on the platform, which is good.
2068175	2069896	So, you know, competition's good.
2070536	2071137	I like to see that.
2071177	2076578	And also, because Grand Theft Auto came out, they pushed Saints Row to add flying vehicles and stuff like that.
2076758	2078599	So, I don't care.
2078619	2079319	They're both awesome.
2079339	2080160	You don't have to pick one.
2080780	2081200	Play them both.
2081909	2086274	Alright, if you want to check out the Saints Row 2 trailer, it just got posted in our chat room there by Tigerclaw.
2086294	2090659	It looks like it's available on GameTrailers.com as a lot of game trailers are.
2090719	2091840	It's not just a clever site name.
2093786	2102049	You know, Saints Row 2 though, if there is competition, Saints Row is really going to have to kind of sell a lot because the bar has been set pretty high.
2102469	2111492	Grand Theft Auto 4 has sold 8.5 million units directly to consumers, 11 million copies sold to retailers.
2111532	2116894	So yes, that means about 2.5 million are sitting on store shelves right now, waiting to be scooped up through the holiday season.
2117394	2121716	That was all reported in Take-Two's second quarter financials reported earlier this week, so...
2122576	2125639	Not too shabby 11 million units sold to retailers.
2126219	2128461	Take two very happy campers right now.
2129162	2130203	Extremely happy campers.
2131243	2134706	I wish I could sell 11 million units of one of my dream games.
2135086	2135567	I'd be rich.
2136027	2136968	I'd never have to work again.
2139070	2143994	Although we all know, I'm telling you, if LaserCats the game came out, that's like 25 million.
2144014	2145735	25 billion units.
2146455	2146876	I don't care.
2147196	2150759	There's not that many people in the world that everybody would buy like five copies because it would be that awesome.
2152625	2153045	Don't you think?
2154186	2155326	I smell another E.T.
2157487	2157767	Uh-oh.
2158047	2161588	You know, speaking of E.T., this is going to sound so random, but I don't care.
2161628	2162348	I'm in a mood tonight.
2163208	2168010	I was on Wikipedia this week reading about old-school Atari games like E.T.
2168110	2169950	and Pac-Man and, like, why they failed.
2170291	2171171	And it was fascinating.
2171611	2171911	I don't know.
2171951	2173952	I'm just kind of reading up on my video game history.
2174232	2176933	I think it's good to brush up on your video game history once in a while.
2177873	2178633	Because you played E.T.
2179013	2181114	and you're like, how is this anything like the movie?
2182349	2183029	I don't get this.
2183670	2184950	I didn't get it when I was five.
2185111	2186091	I don't get it now.
2187052	2187592	Forget it.
2187732	2188593	Can I do my story?
2188833	2189173	Yes.
2189753	2190774	Okay then, thank you.
2192195	2203721	More Xbox Live Arcade news is Commando 3, that's Wolf of the Battlefield, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade as of, I believe, next Wednesday.
2204662	2205742	And will be 800 points.
2207083	2210465	And it also has an invite to Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix Beta.
2213638	2217863	So I wonder how many percentage of the purchasers of Commando 3 are actually trying to get the beta.
2219105	2221207	Like what happened with Crackdown in the Halo 3 beta.
2221868	2222248	No idea.
2223770	2226734	But Crackdown was a pretty good game, so hopefully Commando 3 is a pretty good game as well.
2227520	2229001	That would make it very worth it.
2229602	2232344	But I'm not a big fan of all these 800 price points lately.
2232364	2233765	Whatever happened to the $5 games?
2234425	2235366	When was the last time we got a $5 game?
2235426	2237327	Oh, wait, we had like Warlords and stuff.
2237367	2239269	I guess that wasn't really worth it, though.
2239289	2241650	Well, now the Penny Arcade came out for 1,600 points.
2241710	2245473	Everyone's like, hey, that game sells really well.
2245513	2245613	It's $20.
2246154	2247575	Let's make our shitty games $20, too.
2247595	2250196	Did anybody think there was a reason?
2251457	2251858	Forget it.
2252018	2253159	They won't put two and two together.
2254179	2254740	Well, we'll see.
2256260	2261203	If you don't want to download that, there are some other things you can download, especially if you own Guitar Hero 3.
2261303	2265145	They're going to have some new Motorhead tracks coming out.
2266352	2268134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2289092	2296677	The pack that's coming out next week, which is the Isle of Wight, that is coming out June 12th.
2297397	2301640	The price has been unconfirmed, but it's probably going to be also 500 Microsoft points.
2302120	2310125	Includes Shoot the Runner by Cosbian, I Predict a Riot by Kaiser Chiefs, and Problems by the Sex Pistols.
2311906	2313187	So that's pretty awesome.
2314973	2315454	All right.
2315714	2322799	Well, also, speaking of ever-expanding games, Soul Calibur IV, the roster of players just keeps growing and growing.
2323240	2330205	And interestingly enough, when we got Darth Vader and Yoda announced for Soul Calibur IV, people were kind of like, oh, ha-ha, that's cute.
2330225	2332827	We're going to have these Star Wars characters in the game.
2332847	2333648	That's kind of random.
2334008	2335049	But here's the weird thing.
2335689	2336990	Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur
2353670	2356031	I'll say it again after I've played the game.
2356111	2356511	We'll see.
2356831	2357551	But here's the deal.
2357951	2363753	Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice is going to be in both versions of Soul Calibur 4.
2363953	2367314	Because, you know, Darth Vader's only going to be in the PS3 one, Yoda in the Xbox 360 one.
2367554	2372796	However, the Secret Apprentice... Now, the Secret Apprentice comes from Star Wars The Force Unleashed.
2373896	2376357	This guy's actually going to be in Soul Calibur 4.
2377197	2377877	So check that out.
2378937	2381198	When that game comes out a little later this year...
2382005	2384027	You know, they need to put Bob Barker into a fighting game.
2385087	2385528	Uh, huh?
2386408	2388110	Yeah, Bob Barker needs to be in a fighting game.
2388270	2389351	I mean, that would be pretty badass.
2389931	2390652	Immortalize him.
2391092	2392433	Put him in another Soul Calibur game.
2393194	2394755	Soul Calibur versus Happy Gilmore?
2394795	2395456	I don't know about that.
2396016	2397858	No, just like TV show hosts.
2398098	2398618	Just throw him in.
2398778	2399059	Random.
2399099	2400079	It doesn't have to make any sense.
2400480	2401921	The Star Wars stuff doesn't make any sense.
2402461	2403122	Just throw it in.
2403604	2407445	So if it's TV show hosts, can he beat up Rosie O'Donnell and Barbara Walters?
2408065	2408426	Yeah, sure.
2409146	2409806	Anything can happen.
2410326	2415628	Bob Barker, don't you know that he's held together by Clay and that formula from Death Becomes Her?
2416168	2417168	Celebrity Deathmatch.
2417228	2418689	That already was a game, wasn't it?
2420169	2421790	Speaking of characters held together by Clay.
2422370	2422890	I know, really.
2423090	2424471	Maybe they just need Celebrity Deathmatch 2.
2425666	2445778	that would be great but you know what they should have if they did something like that is have download characters and have it you know where you could customize you know they have like you know like they do in the wrestling game so you can make different you know people you know mimic them in wrestling games you should have something like that in Celebrity Deathmatch could be make your own celebrity
2446158	2446918	See what they need to do?
2447058	2448259	They need to have more games.
2448279	2449319	I'm a celebrity, damn it.
2449659	2450760	I want to put myself in the game.
2450820	2451700	I'm an internet celebrity.
2451760	2452940	I have a pen that says so.
2453280	2461763	What they need to do is have more games that have that kind of same humor as Kung Fu Hustle, kind of like God Hand, where it's just ridiculous and more of an anime style.
2462123	2469386	That was more of a brawling game, but more of a fighting game with some funny characters that are just really exaggerated and stuff like that.
2470987	2474049	Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur gets a lot of reaction from chat.
2474069	2474849	Let's check this out.
2474989	2478112	Gerardimo says, Star Wars, GTFO of my Soul Calibur.
2478152	2479713	Go get your own fighting game.
2480874	2483596	No, they already did that and that didn't turn out too well either.
2484476	2485057	The Terra...
2485757	2486778	Then let Namco do it.
2486798	2492342	Well, actually though, they're going to be doing something with the Force Unleashed on the Wii.
2492382	2494043	It's going to have a fighting game portion of it.
2494364	2498007	Why don't they just put a Star Wars game that's based off the Soul Calibur engine?
2498267	2501729	GS68 says this is Soul Calibur, not fucking Star Wars Calibur.
2502270	2505672	Cheeseburger says Chuck Norris in Soul Calibur will roundhouse kick everyone.
2506793	2507394	I dig that.
2507534	2509635	He doesn't have a sword, he just has his roundhouse kicks.
2510056	2510416	Why not?
2510916	2515300	GS68 says luckily if anyone picks a Star Wars character, I'll pick Ivy and suffocate them to death.
2516954	2518095	I'd be like boob smash.
2518616	2519016	Exactly.
2519717	2522800	Chat.orange.com Is it my turn now?
2522980	2523180	Is it?
2523240	2523400	Is it?
2523440	2523661	Is it?
2523761	2524141	It is.
2524862	2525242	Yay.
2526683	2532429	Well, I'm sure people who've listened to this show for quite a while now know that I have an interest in law.
2533310	2535532	I love... What?
2536173	2537033	But you are the law.
2538415	2538595	Rob.
2540613	2540893	What?
2541694	2545138	You know, I think that's an unhealthy obsession that you have there with Tekken.
2545479	2548042	I was just waiting for her to go I am the law.
2549625	2551946	I do have a Judge Dredd pinball machine in my house.
2552326	2553086	Thank you very much.
2555627	2562648	One of the former Supreme Court judges, Sandra Day O'Connor, is wanting to make a game that teaches court lessons.
2562708	2564489	It's called Our Courts.
2565329	2567249	It's a free game for kids between 12 and 15.
2567349	2577092	It basically lets you learn how courtrooms work, what the system is like, and learn actual legal issues.
2578192	2592015	When I was in school, we used to do court simulations using the modern-day courtroom system to judge historical acts.
2592095	2594836	I got to be Marie Antoinette, so I had to be really... Awesome!
2595656	2595956	I know.
2596917	2597757	Did they behead you?
2599857	2606679	First and foremost, don't get me started on the French Revolution because... Alright, because no one wants to hear about that.
2609102	2611643	Keep in mind, I'm a history buff.
2611663	2612563	I love my history.
2613403	2616023	Look, here, I'll retard the conversation a little bit.
2616223	2618624	You know what we did in our school to practice courtroom?
2618844	2619044	What?
2619444	2622565	We watched Nickelodeon Kids Court hosted by Paul Provanza.
2622945	2623585	That's what we did.
2626685	2632626	Oh, the other thing that we also did at my school was model United Nations and I got to be on the Security Council my senior year and that was freaking badass.
2633427	2635107	Because I had to tell both China and the U.S.
2635147	2635707	to shut up.
2636400	2637561	What country did you represent?
2637601	2637941	Hungary.
2642084	2642524	It was great.
2642544	2644045	Hungary was on the Security Council that year.
2645005	2653911	Considering that your life has evolved into a food podcast that sometimes talks about video games, that's really funny that you represented Hungary.
2654811	2655432	Oh, come on.
2656052	2656332	I know.
2656933	2658534	Home of the Habsburgs, right?
2658914	2659254	Anyway.
2660315	2661896	You can't write this shit, you guys.
2661956	2663237	It's all true.
2663357	2663677	Whatever.
2664097	2664658	So anyway...
2666983	2683781	It's basically just an educational game supposed to be put out so that children have a better understanding of how the government works without having to see the sort of farcical side of law enforcement with Grand Theft Auto and those types of things.
2684362	2686344	You know, to actually see where...
2687639	2688460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2705643	2706144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2719308	2720889	I want to give it a try.
2720949	2726231	She's actually quoted saying it will allow students to engage in real legal issues.
2727812	2732514	And it gives an example of a debate by someone wearing a controversial t-shirt.
2732534	2741978	So I guess that freedom of speech versus how stupidly offended everybody in this country gets over people sneezing the wrong way.
2742598	2744178	Sorry.
2744419	2747860	Robert M. makes the mandatory Phoenix Wright reference by saying, hold it
2748584	2749305	Yes, hold it.
2753307	2757210	Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.
2757230	2764556	There's been a couple stories that have come out recently about different gaming surveys and, oh my god, what it means and stuff like that.
2764676	2766257	Yeah, I have never seen anything about this.
2766677	2769219	And this just totally slipped under the radar for everybody, I think.
2771212	2772053	Thanks for watching!
2790134	2792515	What they describe, basically, here's their description of it.
2792575	2799060	This game will be a game creator and will provide a simple way to make your own games on the Xbox.
2799280	2806085	Using just the Xbox controller, you can build worlds, populate them with characters, and give the characters unique behaviors.
2806585	2812169	You can easily build racing games, platformers, and adventure games without touching a keyboard or leaving your couch.
2812569	2817153	So this is either XNA for dummies or LittleBigPlanet thing?
2837169	2842553	Boku is a programming environment for children that runs on Windows and the Xbox 360.
2843814	2849878	And basically what makes it kind of different is it uses symbols.
2849898	2856243	You have different objects for each symbol and you have actions and then other objects.
2856283	2858485	So you kind of tie them all together without any programming language.
2858505	2862107	So say you have a creature that looks like Pac-Man or something like that.
2862167	2862848	You could say...
2864051	2866334	The Pac-Man character eats dots.
2866735	2871320	And so that character will now seek out the dots and try to eat them or something like that.
2871420	2872702	It's basically simple like that.
2872802	2873623	But here's what I see.
2874693	2876314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2897262	2897742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2915433	2916113	I don't know what that is.
2916133	2917554	Can you link that picture to our chat?
2917974	2918494	That's funny.
2919174	2920854	It looks like a pregnant Batman ghost.
2921154	2923135	But I just think it's really interesting.
2924095	2925555	Now, Dark Tattoo says it sounds neat.
2925595	2929456	I wish there was a PC version, but this is something being developed across both platforms, right?
2929476	2931637	It is going to be Windows and for the 360.
2933217	2940739	No idea, though, when it's going to be released or anything in that sense, but it looks like they're still working on it if they're sending out surveys about this thing.
2940959	2943521	Why has this only been a blip on the gaming radar?
2962594	2965316	This came out in 2007, the TechFest 2007.
2965376	2970759	So like March of last year is when this originally was shown.
2971319	2972440	And they only had it demoing.
2972740	2975202	So it was covered by Wired.
2975482	2978243	They actually had a little piece on it.
2978283	2979144	But that's about it.
2979304	2981205	I mean, I don't know.
2981545	2983486	It's very, very interesting.
2985808	2986108	I don't know.
2986208	2987809	It could be something that's coming soon.
2987909	2988869	Something maybe they'll show at E3.
2990459	2991299	Thank you for watching!
3006824	3008605	Game making software is actually pretty cool.
3008625	3009706	Vaguely, I actually do remember that.
3009726	3009966	Very vaguely.
3009986	3011928	It was pretty cool, but make something like that.
3011988	3022796	Maybe like LittleBigPlanet almost, but you can make your own games using this software and then distribute them to your friends or post them on some sort of integrated message board or something like that.
3023536	3026759	They're going to do the same thing with Blastworks, which is coming out this week.
3026819	3028060	That game is going to be pretty awesome.
3028080	3029961	I think it's going to catch a lot of people by surprise.
3030602	3030842	So...
3032484	3035218	This is the way things are going.
3035298	3036283	I'll link that picture in chat.
3037199	3043601	All right, well, while you're waiting for more information on Boku, you can get some games a little bit sooner across the world.
3043641	3045022	We like to cover release dates.
3045042	3046543	We're going to start off in Japan tonight.
3046623	3049544	Not a lot, sadly, coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
3050104	3054906	But if we look at the PlayStation 3, hello, Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.
3055006	3056226	It's this week in Japan.
3056306	3057867	June the 12th is when you can get that.
3058307	3061428	And that is the Japanese language version you can get over there.
3061468	3063449	There's a premium pack, a special edition.
3063949	3065911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3084768	3085909	A game called Breath.
3086549	3099735	Toki wa Akanero is coming out on June the 12th, as well as another Pachinko game that has to do with Neon Genesis Evangelion is coming out, just because we didn't have enough Evangelion games on the DS.
3100115	3104598	But I'm looking at what this Breath game is all about, and trying to figure out what this is.
3104638	3105858	It looks like an adventure game.
3105898	3111841	I'm trying to figure out if it's another dating sim, because it definitely looks like you have cute girls on the top screen and text on the bottom screen.
3111861	3113302	That's usually a good sign of a dating sim.
3114620	3115320	There's that game.
3116961	3125023	And also coming out in Japan, Othello de Othello DS, which I'm assuming is just the classic game you might know as Reversi.
3125123	3127924	Yeah, it is Othello, the old school game.
3128604	3141408	And also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Sekai wa Atashi de Mawateru is coming out, which is a RPG game from Global A Entertainment.
3142448	3148851	and quickly glancing to see if there's anything on the PSP of note or if Metal Gear is just dominating the Sony universe this week.
3151232	3155893	Medical 91 for Portable is listed for the Sony PSP.
3155973	3156734	That is a game.
3160094	3161918	It's not Trauma Center, I'll tell you that.
3162318	3163340	It's an adventure game.
3163841	3168470	There's no screenshots, I couldn't tell you more about that, but looks like there's one lone game on the PSP this week.
3168490	3172277	But otherwise, not a lot wanting to compete with Metal Gear Solid 4 this week over in Japan.
3173424	3177567	Well, we do have our UK releases, if anyone is interested.
3178007	3182810	We have on the 12th, Metal Gear Solid Online and Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.
3183530	3187072	Don King Presents Prize Fighter, whatever, that's on the 13th.
3187633	3190014	More on the 13th is Doodle Hex on DS.
3190654	3194357	Emergency Heroes, Family Ski, Okami on Wii.
3195017	3201261	Pro Cycling Manager 2008 and Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3204141	3206564	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3221499	3225882	We've got Backyard Baseball 09 on PlayStation 2 and the Wii.
3226843	3230545	Jake Hunter Detective Chronicles on the DS.
3231426	3237529	Looney Tunes Cartoon Conductor, that's the one, if you may remember, that's a rip-off of Elite Beat Agents.
3237890	3239230	That will be coming out on the DS.
3240071	3242753	My Fashion Studio, also on the DS.
3243753	3243893	And...
3245296	3266214	Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and let's see here, Don King Presents Prize Fighter on the Xbox 360 and finally Blastworks, Build, Trade, and Destroy on the Wii, if you own a Wii you must buy this game, I'm telling you right now buy this fucking game huh
3267324	3268385	It's an awesome shooter game.
3268565	3270046	Everything's customizable in it.
3270086	3271066	You can build your own levels.
3271526	3277189	I'm thinking we should run a contest based on it, but I don't know.
3277370	3278150	It looks awesome.
3278450	3279951	I plan on picking it up when it comes out.
3280584	3280884	All right.
3281764	3284085	And GS68 says, Tumiki Fighters, you mean?
3284565	3285286	Well, yes.
3285726	3287826	Well, it's not exactly Tumiki Fighters.
3287926	3295589	They do have Tumiki Fighters in there as an unlockable game, but it is completely rebuilt, and it's a lot more than just Tumiki Fighters.
3295769	3296809	It's not just a ripoff.
3296909	3300711	It's got a lot of stuff to offer, so definitely check it out.
3300731	3301831	Did the company pay you to plug them?
3302071	3311758	No, the company did not pay me to plug it and I'm just, I think it looks really good and they're going to have this whole Blastworks Depot thing where you can upload and download objects created by other people.
3312278	3316081	So, you know, for example, you could take this and make like your own Star Fox game.
3316381	3319783	You can take this and make another Guardian Legends game if you wanted to.
3320424	3321384	You know, stuff like that.
3321505	3323406	So, I mean, I think it has a lot of
3327987	3334230	All right.
3334790	3341432	Well, hey, if you want to get something a little sooner as in right now, the PlayStation Network updated on Thursday, and they added quite a bit of new things.
3341872	3347174	They added something called Core, which we're going to talk a little more about in Part B, but they also added some new downloadable games.
3347254	3349795	Wolf of the Battlefield Commando 3 came out this week, $10.00.
3350835	3352176	as well as NovaStrike.
3352656	3357799	Some new things came out for Guitar Hero 3, including the new God of War song we talked about a few weeks ago.
3357899	3358999	It did finally come out this week.
3359359	3365443	Some new demos for you guys, including Civilization Revolution, Battlefield, Bad Company MP, and NASCAR 09.
3365523	3368444	Also some game videos for some varying games.
3368844	3369725	Hail to the Chimp.
3370225	3377012	which I'm sure you're all downloading right now, Lego Indiana Jones, slightly cooler, and very cool, Resident Evil 5.
3377252	3380235	The trailer is up for that if you're interested in checking that out.
3380615	3381536	Also some new themes.
3381676	3383618	A retro theme has come out for the PlayStation 3.
3383778	3385900	I'm not sure what type of retro that is.
3386120	3387281	How retro could that be?
3387441	3389643	I don't know, maybe PS1 graphics?
3389744	3390765	It's all Betamax.
3392486	3393988	That should be kind of rad.
3395764	3397527	comes up with like the beta logo and stuff.
3398287	3404034	And then a bunch of SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo 2 stuff in the PC PlayStation Store.
3404495	3405376	So you can check that out.
3405416	3410943	Some TV spots, wallpaper, and the whole freaking game itself if you want that.
3411323	3411924	So check that out.
3411964	3413546	PlayStation Network updates this week.
3414588	3418469	Well, another thing that's been updated is Sega's calendar.
3419189	3432512	It looks like that Sonic Unleashed is going to be out in November, but other things people might have been waiting on, like Aliens, Colonial Marines, and Empire Total War are both going to be out in 2009.
3434232	3443894	But the Beijing Olympics game is going to be out on the 27th of June, and on August 27th is a game called Space Siege, which is by Gas Power Games.
3444654	3471554	so other things that are set to be out is a Golden Axe I guess a revamp of it Sonic Chronicles Bioware role playing game and Picto Image DS also a sequel to Yakuza I hate to say this because I know Sega is near and dear to your heart and I don't know how you feel about this series but Golden Axe was something that was way cooler when I was a kid
3472202	3473103	I love Golden Axe.
3473123	3475124	I love Golden Axe the Duel a whole lot too.
3475324	3482809	But I went and I downloaded the Genesis version on Virtual Console and I was just kind of like, oh my god, this game is repetitive and boring.
3482989	3484370	It was so much better when I was a kid.
3484430	3485190	I don't know what it is.
3485691	3489133	But somehow the charm, the magic was lost.
3489193	3492275	Maybe it was because I wasn't playing with friends at a pizza joint.
3492555	3493036	You know what I mean?
3493096	3494797	Games like that are always much funner with friends.
3495117	3497058	Because couldn't you hit each other in that game?
3497098	3498119	Like if you're on that little...
3498419	3498979	and DarkSakura.
3525487	3526448	Spoilers, sorry.
3528369	3531791	I was going to say one of the games she forgot mentioning there.
3532531	3535993	Of course, we're going to like this game on the Wii.
3537134	3537714	Samba de Amigo.
3538375	3539015	That's out this summer.
3539856	3540156	Nice.
3541677	3543238	But only if there's like fake maracas.
3544284	3545245	I love maracas.
3546205	3549067	You know someone's going to release a maracas attachment.
3549207	3549727	They will.
3549787	3553689	They've talked about the little plastic sleeves and silly things like that.
3553709	3559252	And besides, if they don't, what a difference duct tape and maracas can make.
3559652	3562373	All you need to do is order more free condoms for your controller.
3563674	3565775	Seriously, we should do, okay, you know what we should do?
3566275	3568316	The Orange Zones Radio Edition maracas.
3568657	3569037	I love it.
3569758	3573939	and we make them out of paper mache like you used to do in kindergarten.
3574059	3575539	We'll get all the supplies at Michael's.
3575979	3576399	We will.
3576739	3579520	You can actually just buy gourds and duct tape a gourd to it.
3579560	3580680	That'd be fantastic.
3582860	3586121	If you don't live, Michael's is all across the US, right?
3586721	3587181	I think so.
3588161	3588921	It's a craft store.
3588941	3592082	If you live abroad, you haven't lived until you've visited a Michael's.
3592122	3593162	Let me just put it that way.
3595783	3597023	It's a great little craft store.
3597183	3597903	Anyway, forget it.
3598820	3606906	Dude, okay, I've been spending so much time with stuff I have to get at Michael's that, okay, I'm gonna make maracas.
3607546	3608127	Just you watch.
3608147	3608407	Do it.
3608467	3608987	I'll make them.
3609187	3610408	Put it on YouTube and all that stuff.
3610809	3612090	We have a YouTube channel we don't use for anything.
3612110	3613010	But I won't be on YouTube.
3613390	3614491	Your hands can be, right?
3615292	3615532	Yeah.
3615652	3618494	I've actually thought about buying a tub of the fondant there one time.
3619135	3621316	Because that stuff tastes like those animal cookies.
3622217	3623298	But it's really not good for you.
3623738	3624218	All right, forget it.
3624258	3624859	Move on, move on.
3625994	3627816	So something that has nothing to do with Michaels.
3630257	3637002	Unfortunately, it's sad to see that Itagaki has left Tecmo.
3637102	3642566	So you're not going to see him helming any more Ninja Gaiden or Dead or Alive games.
3643027	3644788	At least not with Team Ninja.
3647170	3650752	I don't know why he left, but I guess just...
3653204	3659913	Emotional distress, worsening personal relationships and work environment.
3660233	3663337	If I remember right, wasn't there something about unpaid overtime too?
3663678	3664859	Or something that factored into it?
3665836	3668318	I'm sure there are... Basically, he's a very disgruntled employee right now.
3668538	3669078	He's a rock star.
3669098	3671860	He can't be, like, you know, tied down with a job and stuff.
3671900	3673221	He has to be trashing hotel rooms.
3673241	3674982	Itagaki is a fucking rock star.
3675042	3679105	Like, you know, you don't see a lot of, like, gaming rock stars.
3679145	3679786	That's what they need.
3679826	3681166	Itagaki is a rock star.
3681247	3687171	They need him to hang out with, like, say, the guy that, you know, does the Castlevania games, Akira Yamaoka.
3687411	3693595	Just, like, make this, like, really kick-ass, like, you know, Guitar Wolf programming team that just, like, fucking says...
3693975	3699720	You know, they come in, they kick over the microphone, they're like, fuck this, you're buying our fucking game, and everyone's like, hell yeah I am!
3700120	3701641	So that's how they need to do it.
3702022	3705704	Because that would just, like, scare the crap out of the press.
3705765	3706625	That would be awesome.
3706885	3713751	Just come in, set something on fire, throw it into the crowd, just like, you know, that's how you sell your game.
3715493	3720457	Women coming out and wearing nothing but, you know, skimpy ass clothing.
3720497	3722258	They don't fucking care if it's offensive.
3722298	3723639	They're just like, whatever, man.
3724320	3726361	Just some fabric they bought at Michael's.
3726501	3726961	That's all.
3730544	3731845	Whipped cream, that's it.
3732005	3732866	Just whipped cream.
3735253	3736634	Barbecue condiments, I don't know.
3736694	3737935	Itagaki is a rock star.
3737955	3739736	So he'll go on to doing something, right?
3739776	3741377	I'm sure, yeah.
3741957	3748121	Just hopefully he doesn't decide to go develop playground equipment like a certain other people.
3748241	3751443	Unless the playground equipment electrocutes children.
3752884	3753665	That I could see.
3753725	3755686	And has fake boobs that are on it.
3756446	3758648	Yeah, yeah.
3760734	3764515	Yeah, that's what he does in the middle of the presentation, just a motorboat right there.
3766436	3767516	Busts out with that.
3768236	3769236	Empire game.
3772477	3776018	How come you never see someone like him busted for destroying hotel rooms?
3776038	3777099	That's what I want to know.
3777239	3777679	I don't know.
3777799	3779419	Like, just wait for this year's E3.
3779459	3781580	You know, that could be the Rock Band sequel.
3782896	3792663	No, keep in mind, instead of, you have Rock Band the RPG, where, you know, you go and you trash hotel rooms and have groupies and, you know, that type of thing.
3792763	3793584	Wouldn't that be awesome?
3793604	3795705	How about video game Rock Band or something?
3795745	3797026	Because you could play as Itagaki.
3797046	3797687	All right, maybe not.
3798347	3798728	Maybe not.
3799268	3801950	You know, Itagaki's got his own thing going on.
3802030	3803011	He's, you know, cool.
3804011	3806813	He wants to have champagne and only green M&Ms.
3807414	3807594	Yeah.
3812183	3812664	What would it be?
3812684	3812824	What?
3832509	3833089	Africa!
3834050	3835250	On to things less cool.
3853618	3862702	You're going to be a photojournalist, and you can take pictures on foot, in a car, or by air balloon, which is kind of rad, because you don't see hot air balloons make many gaming appearances.
3864003	3871547	And you can unlock non-CG pictures and actual research footage of animals as you encounter animals in game.
3872167	3874268	And it comes out on August 28th.
3874308	3875909	You build up this animal library.
3876369	3877069	Well, great.
3877129	3880551	I would like to know as much as possible about the things I'm running over in my Jeep.
3882552	3884253	I don't think you can do that in the game.
3885033	3885353	Damn it.
3886094	3889815	So basically it's Africa Snap, but it doesn't sound like it's on a track.
3889935	3891276	It sounds kind of a whole lot cooler.
3891616	3892297	I got to say this.
3892357	3905983	I was watching a trailer for the game, and with the graphics and all, I got to say, it does look like potentially it's going to be a very kick-ass, like I don't even know if you really call it a game, like a kick-ass thing.
3908179	3909880	It looks really neat, I gotta say.
3910021	3914684	So, you know, maybe we'll all end up eating crow about making fun of this game at E3 a few years ago.
3915384	3916685	But it actually looks kind of neat.
3917065	3918086	So I want to check this out.
3918766	3921228	Right, and then Aya Judgment's gonna be awesome too.
3921488	3921949	Oh, wait.
3922049	3923870	No, I mean, you really gotta check out the preview.
3923890	3925131	Like, the graphics look gorgeous.
3925571	3926312	Absolutely gorgeous.
3926692	3927793	Yeah, they do look gorgeous.
3928513	3929194	Great.
3929494	3930534	What does it say about the gameplay?
3930795	3931275	Nothing.
3931595	3931995	Exactly.
3932096	3934737	And the gameplay could suck, and this game could still suck.
3935078	3936779	But I'm just saying, there's hope.
3938477	3939577	Before, we had no hope.
3940819	3942120	Africa was just the running joke.
3942460	3944802	But now that we're finding out a little bit about it, it sounds interesting.
3944842	3945182	Exactly.
3945222	3948305	Just like Frisbee says in the chatroom, Africa equals Endless Ocean.
3948965	3950126	Yes, pretty much.
3950366	3951507	And how did Endless Ocean do?
3951707	3952728	Not very well.
3954810	3956652	There was another Safari game that was on the Wii.
3956992	3957672	That sucked.
3958213	3966600	I'd say the only Safari game that did any... This is not even really a Safari game, but a similar game that did really well was Pokemon Snap.
3967219	3969101	I'm going to guess that's because it had Pokemon in it.
3969261	3972143	Have we ever had a really kick-ass Safari game?
3972423	3973825	Like Jumbo Safari, of course.
3974065	3975586	That's just an arcade game.
3975606	3978769	People like that game because the seat moves and you're going really fast.
3978929	3979609	And you're catching animals.
3979650	3980670	And you can throw harpoons.
3982232	3984534	Harpoons make every game better!
3986125	3988286	Add that to the list of things that make games better.
3988486	3989266	One, Dragon Force.
3989326	3990046	Two, Harpoons.
3991126	3991546	That is true.
3991586	3992306	Three, Pokemon.
3992466	3994447	Who didn't love Scorpion in the first Mortal Kombat?
3994467	3995887	Pokemon does not make things better.
3996587	3996987	Stop that.
3997267	3997548	Okay.
3998628	3999468	That is wrong.
3999868	4000868	Yikes, it has been stricken.
4000888	4002168	Pokemon has flavor.
4004009	4005129	Okay.
4005289	4006890	Eating Pokemon would make a game better.
4006910	4007270	Okay, okay.
4007590	4009110	Number one thing that makes games better.
4010750	4011290	Dragon Force.
4012151	4013471	By the way, they have a new album coming out.
4013511	4013711	What?
4013991	4014532	Do what?
4014812	4015312	Number two.
4015893	4016774	Things that make games better.
4016934	4017454	Harpoons.
4018636	4018936	Three.
4019456	4021618	The other things that make games better.
4021699	4022059	Fire.
4022339	4023020	Shooting hookers.
4024221	4026043	We need to get them on the show promoting their album.
4026864	4028405	I will send them an email right after the show.
4028765	4029026	I will.
4029566	4029826	All right.
4030942	4033384	However, we have some other business to take care of real quick.
4034525	4034946	I like this.
4035246	4040631	Tiger Claw says in chat, the real question is, will Africa show animals doing it?
4040871	4041232	Yes.
4041532	4041752	Nope.
4042012	4047297	Since it's supposed to stimulate the wildlife.
4047337	4048538	Well, we know where my brain is.
4048959	4053403	Since it's supposed to simulate wildlife, what do wildlife often do?
4054847	4057149	Two things.
4057709	4058790	One, animals fuck.
4059050	4064854	Two, monkeys throw poo.
4064874	4066275	The end.
4067656	4074581	Did you see that there's a little robotic camera that you can drive around and take pictures with in Africa?
4076021	4078903	Yeah, there was like that little, like it looked like a Mars lander or something.
4078923	4079564	It looked kind of rad.
4079584	4080985	I can't wait to annoy things with that.
4081245	4081806	That's it.
4082506	4083527	Dark Tetsuya's got it.
4084127	4084307	What?
4084548	4089511	Instead of doing Africa, they should do Jurassic Park with a cam.
4090512	4094695	And you could like drop lawyers in there and, you know, watch them eat people.
4094716	4098098	Were you trying to avoid getting eaten by a velociraptor?
4098338	4099799	No, you have a robot camera.
4100340	4100480	Dude.
4102126	4106428	Taking a trip down memory lane for a minute, and we're about to get into the Classic Game of the Week, so this is okay.
4106808	4111430	I don't know if you remember this game, the original Jurassic Park game that was on Super Nintendo.
4111870	4115411	It boasted like it was one of the first games that used surround sound and all this stuff.
4115711	4118772	Now here's the thing, is that the game was kind of split into two parts.
4119233	4128216	There was an overworld thing that was kind of generic, like it was your basic 3D ISO type view where you go around the world collecting things, whatever.
4128596	4129176	Thank you for watching!
4149406	4150146	It was freaky.
4150226	4152207	And then Hitler comes out in a robotic machine.
4152387	4157148	But I was at Chesterview Lanes one time, back when they had an arcade and not a pro shop.
4157829	4162910	And they had, for some reason, their Jurassic Park shooter game was broken.
4164151	4165771	And so I got to play on free play the whole time.
4166291	4167271	So I've beaten the arcade one.
4167291	4169032	You know what I'm very disappointed in?
4169092	4170973	This is totally off topic, but that's fine.
4171513	4172353	Off topic, guys?
4172433	4172673	Who?
4172793	4173453	This show?
4173573	4174234	Off topic?
4174494	4175334	It has to do with games.
4176554	4176814	A couch.
4199261	4202162	We are getting a couch and I'm thinking we're going to put it right there where Loki usually sits.
4202182	4202342	Awesome.
4202362	4202822	By the way.
4202902	4203622	Jamie has the blue seat.
4204102	4211584	I am going to buy us an air conditioner with the funds that were donated to us.
4211664	4212125	Hooray.
4213145	4218846	And we're going to put it in that window and we're not going to burn our asses off here in the studio.
4219006	4219887	It's not that bad.
4220167	4221767	Not right now, but wait until August.
4221847	4222247	Hello.
4223007	4224008	Well, we could get more fans.
4224108	4226048	We'll get the damn air conditioner.
4226688	4227129	You know what?
4227189	4228429	We need a game called Beat the Heat.
4229375	4231818	or you actually take like pockets of heat and beat them to death.
4232258	4234060	One other quick thing about Jurassic Park.
4234121	4238325	Wasn't it weird that the Genesis version of Jurassic Park was like a completely fucking different game?
4239487	4240948	It was like, it was more of a side-scroller.
4240988	4241589	It was better.
4242250	4243051	It actually, well, kind of.
4243091	4245213	He could play as the Velociraptor and kill people.
4245313	4246375	True, alright, there you go.
4247250	4251852	Just about everything was different, you know, for games that would come out on one system versus the other.
4252312	4252592	All right.
4253613	4258695	Look, nostalgia is awesome and all, but we have another segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4258735	4261756	It's a chance for us to... It's nostalgic, too.
4262276	4263417	It is very nostalgic.
4263457	4268719	It's a chance for us to pay tribute, if you will, to the elders of gaming.
4268979	4269139	What?
4269879	4273961	I had a list of two, and thanks to Sauce, I have a list of one.
4274721	4276282	Well, you'll just use the other one next week, won't you?
4277419	4278420	I'll probably forget.
4278680	4278880	All right.
4279361	4280982	And I had to go in the vault to pick this again, too.
4281002	4281542	Look, look.
4282483	4287566	It's a classic video game of the week for you kids to dig up and play.
4288147	4291169	And DarkSakura is dug through the archives with sauce.
4291189	4291749	The archives.
4291769	4292349	The archives.
4292390	4293450	What is wrong with me tonight?
4293490	4293911	I'm broken.
4293951	4294711	Malfunction, malfunction.
4294991	4295231	All right.
4296392	4298674	Exterminate.
4298714	4300075	Exterminate.
4300195	4301916	What is the classic game the kids should be playing this week?
4302496	4303477	Space Channel 5.
4303517	4304518	Space Channel 5.
4306016	4307177	I came to the lobby.
4308237	4315400	According to the information, there are a lot of pilots and viewers.
4336759	4339561	We'll listen to some awesome boss music too while you talk about the game.
4339801	4342243	Well, I want to actually, because it's my favorite music in the game.
4342283	4342844	Alright, then we won't.
4342864	4343044	Yeah.
4343264	4351290	Anyway, Space Channel 5 is a game where it's sort of like a Simon Says kind of game where you play as a reporter named Ulala.
4352892	4362539	And this one is obviously from the Japanese version, but her voice actor in America was Apollo Smile, who was supposed to be like the living anime girl who's actually kind of a big hoe.
4363019	4363380	But, um...
4364850	4368502	With this one though, it is technically a music slash puzzle game.
4371460	4378085	So the whole point of this is that you run into these little aliens called Melodians.
4378586	4381848	And it's funny when you have your load screen that says, Now Meloding, which I thought was pretty funny.
4382589	4389554	But anyway, they'll name out a direction and then maybe a shoot button, and you have to mimic it when it's your turn.
4389754	4393898	And it has to be perfectly in time with the same rhythm that they did.
4394438	4396420	So you have to have a really good sense
4397100	4397300	and so on.
4416668	4420591	There's also a Game Boy Advance one that I didn't play because I refused to.
4421432	4428438	And Rez had Merolion in it as one of the evolutions for the characters.
4428458	4430860	So that was pretty cool.
4431081	4434043	There's also a Space Channel 5 minigame in Sega Superstars.
4434103	4435324	There's a spawn at the...
4436685	4437426	I've seen that.
4437466	4438107	She's in the add-ons, too.
4454362	4458386	Ulala and Pudding are playable characters in Sega Super Star Tennis.
4458787	4459888	Pudding is like her rival.
4461289	4463191	Pudding is also one of the best video game characters ever.
4463711	4465012	There's also Space Channel 5 Part 2.
4465813	4466654	Do you like D-Lite?
4472619	4473279	The group D.L.I.T.E.
4473780	4476440	I like the one song that everybody knows by D.L.I.T.E.
4476460	4477561	Quick, name two D.L.I.T.E.
4477581	4478121	songs.
4478201	4481302	It was Grooves in the Heart that everyone knows.
4481342	4485403	And I have one of their later albums that I thought was really good.
4485883	4495367	But Lady Miss Keir, who is their singer, actually opened a lawsuit against Sega for basing Ulala off of her without her permission.
4496954	4524602	and Hippolytus is in chat right now knows quite a bit about Delight apparently they split up years ago and Kier Kirby and DJ Dimitri married and Tawate was in that group too and he does remixes for like everybody but anyway the way that that went is that Sega offered her $16,000 for licensing and to use their songs and she refused and they went ahead and made the game anyway but she lost the lawsuit and had to pay Sega's legal fees so
4525682	4525942	of $608,000.
4526002	4534188	So, um... And actually, that was Michael Jackson doing his own voice acting in the game, by the way.
4534708	4536529	Because Michael Jackson loves Sega.
4536769	4538731	Didn't he only say, like, two things in the game, though?
4538891	4540151	He said, thank you, ooh-la-la.
4540632	4544694	Sega made that freaking Moonwalker game, which was all kinds of badass.
4544914	4551679	Well, actually, he had a whole big... In Space Shuttle 5 Part 2, there's a whole part of the game that's doing nothing but Michael Jackson dances.
4552319	4553660	I'm at the rocket launch site.
4553680	4554900	What could it be?
4554960	4556221	I can sense something suspicious.
4582112	4583635	I remember this stage.
4584115	4595132	Gerardmo Boots, he says, the first level is my favorite song they sing.
4602095	4611825	Up, Up, Kick, Up, Up, Kick, Right, Left, Kick, Right, Left, Kick, Down, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick,
4619352	4619492	Shit!
4619512	4619632	Shit!
4619652	4619933	Shit!
4619973	4620073	Shit!
4642230	4643412	When she saves people.
4643952	4645354	Hey, I think is what they say.
4645494	4650500	But anyway, Space Channel 5 too, though, had my favorite bad guy in any game ever, though.
4650920	4655545	And that was the three robots that had the speakers coming out of their head that would sing like the barbershop quartet.
4655566	4656286	I think I remember that.
4656447	4658088	They were awesome.
4659090	4660531	We need more Space Channel 5.
4660751	4661492	We need more Ulala.
4663490	4663990	will be awesome.
4664450	4664710	All right.
4665451	4670272	Space Channel 5 is your classic game of the week available on the Dreamcast.
4670713	4672993	Also, it was repackaged for PlayStation 2.
4673033	4673714	That's right.
4673974	4675974	So check it out on either of those systems.
4675994	4678916	Would you say they're both good or you need to actually check it out?
4678936	4679616	Yeah, that's what I figured.
4680756	4681917	You always pick Dreamcast games.
4681937	4683179	Actually, actually, actually, Rob.
4683379	4683539	What?
4683559	4689284	I have to say that I do have Space Channel 5 2 on PlayStation 2.
4690004	4690885	And it was really good.
4691486	4694028	And I have played Space Channel 5 on PlayStation 2.
4694468	4696750	And it was also very good.
4696810	4697931	It was a very good port.
4698472	4699232	Alright, very cool.
4699833	4700714	Alright, I have a request.
4700814	4703056	Next week I'm going to challenge you to pick something not Sega.
4704835	4712751	But, I haven't done Sega, I don't, what was, okay, last week was Sega, the week before that, oh, the week before that was Sega.
4712771	4713573	Yeah, exactly.
4713593	4714695	What was the week before that?
4715612	4716492	Go check the wiki.
4716532	4717352	I'm just giving you a hard time.
4717412	4718233	Pick whatever the hell you want.
4718273	4719753	Sega is awesome.
4719853	4723074	Is there something creepy and not related to Sega in any way?
4723754	4725834	They're making another Barbie Horse Adventures game.
4725914	4726455	The fuck?
4726515	4727515	Okay, chat room.
4727695	4729035	People who update our wiki.
4729795	4740938	I need someone who has elite skills in Excel or Access to put everything into a spreadsheet and see the percentage of games that I have picked that are Sega.
4742546	4742906	Alright.
4743086	4743467	Thank you.
4743847	4744607	It's in Excel.
4744647	4745448	It's freaking easy.
4746168	4749511	AJ Mix says eight Sega games overall, I guess.
4749751	4750331	That's not that bad.
4750351	4750952	That's not that bad.
4751312	4751572	Alright.
4752112	4753273	Look, I'm just giving her a hard time.
4753413	4754394	That's what I do here on the program.
4754414	4755194	That's what they pay me to do.
4755234	4757576	I have to give a hard time back by having no sense of humor.
4757776	4758036	Alright.
4758456	4758677	Rob?
4759037	4759197	What?
4761325	4765108	We're going to take a well-deserved break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
