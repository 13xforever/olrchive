410000	414000	The only thing about Defend Your Castle is it gets a little bit old
414000	416000	Especially if you're playing by yourself
416000	417000	But it's a neat party game
417000	419000	Who doesn't love flinging people to their deaths?
419000	422000	I'm surprised DarkSakura isn't all over this game
422000	426000	She could be flinging helpless bad guys to their deaths
426000	428000	Defend Your Castle, it's a WiiWare game
428000	430000	I haven't played much Wii lately
430000	432000	I'll have to show it to you at some point, it's fun
432000	434000	It's based on an old, old Flash game
434000	436000	I think it's called the same thing
436000	439000	Defend Your Castle, it's very similar
439000	441000	But it was much bloodier in the Flash version
441000	445000	They had to, you know, Wii-itize it or whatever you want to call it
445000	448000	They had to tone it down, but I like the style
448000	453000	And if you notice also, just like that Gummy Car game or whatever they had
453000	456000	It's all done with the guy's voice
456000	459000	Yes, I love it, his voice is great
459000	462000	That's like the music in the game, it's great
462000	466000	Games I played this week, lots and lots of World of Warcraft
466000	468000	Because I'm kind of addicted
468000	472000	But I did check out a couple of the new arcade games on Xbox Live
472000	475000	These are demos only, so I'm really basing my opinion on demos
475000	477000	Just kind of a disclaimer there
477000	480000	Ace of the Galaxy, I don't know
480000	482000	I played it for a little while, it was kind of interesting
482000	485000	The shooting style of it reminded me a little bit of Rez
485000	488000	Where you could lock on to things and let all your bullets go off at once
488000	492000	But then I go, you know, I'm kind of playing it, and I'm just like, I just want to play Rez
492000	495000	Play a game like this
495000	497000	But it was okay, but I don't know
497000	499000	I can't justify spending little nickels and dimes here and there
499000	501000	Games got to really wow me
501000	504000	Back in the old days of Xbox Live, I was buying everything and everything
504000	507000	I have so much crap on Xbox Live, I can't even stand it
507000	511000	But now a game's got to really wow me, and it just didn't have that for me
511000	515000	I also played Rugu, that new puzzle-y game
515000	518000	But I didn't exactly see where the puzzle was in it
518000	520000	Because it was more of a reaction game
520000	523000	Now granted, I only played the demo of this
523000	527000	And the game made it sound like there was a lot more to be unveiled after the demo
527000	530000	But if that's the case, then the game didn't really sell me
530000	532000	Because all I really saw in the demo was
532000	535000	Turn these little disks as fast as you can
535000	538000	To make sure the shapes, as they fall, fall through the right shape
538000	542000	You remember that old, old game like we had in elementary school called Perfection
542000	545000	Where you had to put those little shapes in the right holes before pop
545000	548000	They all pop out, like before the board explodes
548000	550000	Right, you ever played that game? Am I the one that played that?
550000	551000	I used to play it
551000	552000	I think it was awesome, okay, thank god
552000	554000	Alright, it's kind of like that
554000	556000	You want to make sure you turn the disk
556000	559000	So that a star shape throws to the star hole repeatedly
559000	562000	Or else the galaxy blows up
562000	564000	Basically
564000	565000	In a nutshell
565000	569000	But I couldn't figure out, like, how is this game gonna
569000	572000	I mean, granted as it was going along, it added more shapes
572000	574000	And it got a little harder
574000	577000	And you had to, like, squash these aliens by speeding the bricks up
577000	579000	But it was still about reaction time
579000	581000	I was kind of like, where is the puzzle game in this?
581000	585000	If there's a puzzle game here, the demo totally neglected to show it to me
585000	588000	You have to understand, if there's objects falling down on a screen, it's a puzzle game
588000	590000	I guess, but not to me
590000	593000	So I wasn't very impressed
593000	595000	Which is a darn shame
595000	600000	Because the graphics and previews for the future levels made it look like more exciting things were to come
600000	602000	But I don't know
602000	606000	Maybe I'll have to look it up on the internet and see if there's videos of future levels that make the game more interesting
606000	608000	Because, I mean, it did hold my attention
608000	612000	I was like, whee, rotating disks is fun, this game is easy, I bet it could get lots of achievement points
612000	615000	But then, like, when the demo was over, I was like, that's it?
615000	617000	That's it?
617000	618000	So
618000	620000	Those are the two new games I played this week
620000	625000	Otherwise I've been playing more audio surf as well, that game's pretty rad, I talked about that on last week's show
625000	627000	If you missed that
627000	629000	Alright, we're going to get into some gaming news here shortly
629000	631000	But I also want to introduce the one and only chat room
631000	634000	It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com
634000	638000	Gerardimo in chat says, Rugoo equals the baby toy for adults
638000	640000	Kinda
640000	643000	Gerardimo also says, Rugoo equals boring, a lot
643000	647000	AJ Mix has been playing a lot of Wii in his week
647000	652000	He's been playing Dr. Mario on WiiWare, Battalion Wars Wii, Bomberman Live on Wii, and Mario Paint on the Super Nintendo
652000	654000	That's old school
654000	656000	Anybody checked out Dr. Mario on WiiWare yet?
656000	660000	That's one of those games I keep like, I need to get it, but I have no space
660000	664000	No, this is just like, remember how Nintendo said, oh we have a hundred WiiWare games in development
664000	667000	Yeah, they're all gonna be fucking old clones of shit
667000	669000	And then they're gonna put Dr. Mario out there
669000	670000	Just put Dr. Mario out there
670000	673000	But, hold on, to be fair, Nintendo is the master
673000	674000	No one does it better
674000	677000	Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again
677000	680000	Case in point, Mario All-Stars on Super Nintendo
680000	681000	Who didn't love that game?
681000	684000	Because it was like the upgraded versions of the old Mario games
684000	687000	Nintendo is the master of making old shit new again
687000	689000	And they do a good job of it
689000	692000	Maybe that was a little fanboyish statement, but they do
694000	697000	Now, I have to ask about this before we get into housekeeping tonight
697000	700000	And tonight at housekeeping I'm gonna address why there's been changes on Justin.tv
700000	702000	We'll get to that in a minute
702000	705000	But, first I wanna ask Loki. Loki ran through the door
705000	708000	Like, during the Bobby Black Wolf call
708000	710000	He calls in right before we go live
710000	713000	Because, you know, we tape live on AllGames.com every Sunday night
713000	715000	And if you haven't joined us yet, you ought to
715000	718000	And the show before us is the Bobby Black Wolf show
718000	720000	And, you know, we've been buddy shows for years
720000	722000	So, you know, this is awesome that we follow his show
722000	725000	But he always does this little tease when he calls our program right at the end of the show
725000	727000	And Loki ran in right during that statement
727000	729000	But I got a call right before saying
729000	732000	Rob, I'm gonna be late, there's food problems
732000	735000	So I have to ask
735000	737000	What the hell is the...
737000	739000	How did food drama make you late tonight?
739000	743000	Because the pizza place I ordered these breadsticks from said
743000	744000	It would take 10 minutes
744000	746000	So I went down there, 10 minutes
746000	749000	And took another 20 minutes after I got there
749000	752000	Apparently it was a stupid, stupid employee night
752000	753000	You know, where they're like
753000	756000	Oh, I forgot to put the breadsticks in
756000	757000	Okay, so they put them in
757000	758000	But they only put in half my order
758000	760000	Oh, I forgot to put the other half in
760000	762000	So, you know, I'm just sitting there
762000	763000	Nice
763000	765000	And the guy, you know, up front
765000	766000	Working cash register
766000	768000	Had his mouth open
768000	770000	Kind of drooling there
770000	771000	And some guy's like
771000	774000	Is my pizza ready?
774000	776000	I called it in, he said it's gonna be 20 minutes
776000	778000	And it's been 25
782000	784000	So, can you check on it?
784000	786000	Well, she said that it's gonna be
786000	790000	It was, you know, gonna be about 5 minutes once you've ordered it
790000	791000	What do you mean?
791000	792000	What?
792000	793000	He's like
793000	795000	Oh, well, they just put it in
795000	797000	Can you go check on that?
797000	800000	He's just like stupid and just standing there
800000	802000	I love how food emergencies are a valid excuse
802000	805000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio for making you personally late
805000	808000	I had plenty of time, you know, if my food
808000	810000	Even with like a slight delay
810000	811000	I would have still been here on time
811000	814000	But it was like fucking 40 minutes for breadsticks
814000	816000	That shit takes like 2 minutes to make
816000	817000	Alright
817000	820000	Let's talk about Justin TV at Housekeeping tonight
820000	822000	We've changed a little bit over on Justin TV
822000	823000	Here's what happened
823000	825000	We used to run through an iSight webcam
825000	828000	And my little Mac laptop
828000	830000	We used to run the webcam that way
830000	833000	But the iSight got broken due to my stupidness
833000	835000	And it no longer runs audio through it
835000	837000	So what happened is that this past week
837000	839000	I actually got a video camera
839000	841000	Because I've been wanting a video camera anyway
841000	843000	So I just figured two birds with one stone
843000	844000	I'm gonna get a video camera
844000	845000	We're gonna use it for Justin TV as well
845000	847000	So that's what you see hooked up tonight
847000	848000	We actually have now a video camera
848000	849000	Running on Justin TV
849000	852000	However, here's why the resolution is crappy
852000	853000	Because for some reason
853000	855000	Even though the old Justin TV broadcaster
855000	859000	Used to support 640x480 on the USB capture device
859000	861000	It no longer does that
861000	863000	So we have to use like 160
863000	865000	But it's some really tiny tiny resolution
865000	867000	So the picture's not great
867000	868000	I apologize for that
868000	869000	I will contact Justin TV
869000	870000	And the people who make my card
870000	871000	Try to figure out what's up with that
871000	873000	But then the other thing is that the audio
873000	874000	We were so close
874000	876000	We were gonna have it running through the microphones
876000	880000	But that didn't work out this week
880000	881000	Because with Loki running late
881000	882000	We didn't have enough time to run all the wires
882000	883000	To the places they need to go
883000	884000	So c'est la vie
884000	887000	We're running as the audio through the actual camera tonight
887000	889000	I still think it'll actually be better quality
889000	890000	Than the iSight was
890000	892000	Because as an actual video camera
892000	894000	I think it has better quality
894000	896000	But here's the other cool thing about what we have set up
896000	897000	And what we hope to bring in the future
897000	898000	Is that on Justin TV
898000	899000	All we would have to do
899000	900000	Is make a little switch
900000	901000	Just like this
901000	903000	And you guys won't hear this on the podcast
903000	905000	But they'll see it on Justin TV
905000	908000	You can actually go to live video of gameplay
908000	910000	And playing right now on Justin TV
910000	911000	Is our old favorite 8-bit classic
911000	912000	The Guardian Legend
912000	914000	A little screenshot from there
914000	916000	And you'll be able to see us kinda switch back and forth
916000	917000	So we can actually like
917000	918000	If we talk about games
918000	919000	And we happen to have them up
919000	921000	We can switch just that easily
921000	923000	Now here's the other problem
923000	925000	Is that on Justin TV
925000	926000	Just then
926000	927000	Their audio completely cut out
927000	929000	They only got the audio of the game
929000	931000	They didn't hear us talking over that
931000	933000	So that's the other thing we gotta fix
933000	934000	But we're working on it
934000	937000	Exciting things to come on Justin TV
937000	939000	But since you guys have been crying the past few weeks
939000	941000	Like where's the webcam gone
941000	943000	I wanna show you we've made some progress
943000	944000	We're trying
944000	947000	We are a non-profit organization here at Orange Lounge Radio
947000	948000	K?
948000	949000	Alright
949000	951000	Alright
951000	953000	So anyhow
953000	955000	Let's get into tonight's gaming news, shall we?
955000	957000	If there's no other housekeeping tonight
957000	958000	The only other thing I can think of is
958000	960000	The old plugs for our communities
960000	962000	We love to add people on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio
962000	964000	On LiveJournal at Orange Lounge
964000	966000	Or our Facebook community
966000	967000	The O.L. Army
967000	969000	Let's get to tonight's gaming news, Loki
969000	971000	There's also the Orange Lounge Wiki
971000	972000	At Wikia
972000	974000	Oh that thing is awesome too
974000	976000	This is how awesome our community is
976000	978000	I put out a call on the forums this week
978000	979000	I'm like, hi
979000	981000	I don't know anything about editing Wikis
981000	983000	Like I'm not very good at it at all
983000	984000	I don't know the Wiki language
984000	986000	I think Wiki's a wonderful concept
986000	988000	I need to take my lazy ass
988000	990000	And sit it down for a while and learn Wiki
990000	992000	But the front page on the Wiki right now isn't working for me
992000	994000	Like I can't find things
994000	996000	Can someone please clean up the front page
996000	997000	Within 24 hours
997000	998000	It looks great
998000	1000000	You go there now and it actually has all these articles
1000000	1001000	Linked from the front page
1001000	1002000	It's awesome
1002000	1004000	So if you haven't checked out the Wiki yet
1004000	1005000	Orangeloungeradio.wikia.com
1005000	1007000	A true product of our community
1007000	1009000	They are awesome for doing that
1009000	1010000	Alright
1010000	1013000	Well this is a rumor that never seems to die
1013000	1016000	CrunchGear, a tech blog, is actually reporting
1016000	1018000	That an inside source at Microsoft
1018000	1020000	Who was a former member of the company's
1020000	1022000	HD DVD department
1022000	1024000	Has confirmed that the company will announce
1024000	1027000	That the Xbox 360 will get Blu-ray
1027000	1029000	Before Christmas via a press release
1029000	1031000	That's set to go out tomorrow morning
1031000	1033000	Around 9-10ish
1033000	1036000	Apparently the system
1036000	1039000	They don't really have any info on it right now
1039000	1042000	But it says it will cost less than an Elite system
1042000	1044000	So
1044000	1045000	I don't know
1045000	1047000	This still seems far fetched
1047000	1049000	But I guess we'll just have to wait until tomorrow morning
1049000	1051000	Now won't we
1051000	1053000	Well which will be today
1053000	1055000	By the time this show goes out
1055000	1058000	So either we were really smart
1058000	1059000	In saying this in advance
1059000	1060000	Or we're dumb
1060000	1063000	But it seems like this rumor is always going around
1063000	1065000	That Microsoft is going to be announcing Blu-ray
1065000	1067000	What makes this special
1067000	1069000	All I think that they're going to be doing with this
1069000	1071000	Is just releasing another external thing
1071000	1073000	That's going to have
1073000	1075000	Just like the HD DVD player
1075000	1077000	I mean that would be the only way to do it
1077000	1079000	That's kind of fair to everybody
1079000	1081000	Because if you think about it
1081000	1083000	If you put this in the system
1083000	1085000	Then you're going to have problems with the drive being too slow
1085000	1087000	Because that's what the problem is with the PS3
1087000	1089000	And why you have to install all this shit on there
1089000	1091000	Is because the drive reads too slow
1091000	1093000	So if they had it as an external device
1093000	1095000	That way it puts everybody on level playing field
1095000	1097000	If you don't want it
1097000	1099000	You don't have to buy it
1099000	1101000	If you don't want it it's not going to cost you
1101000	1103000	As much as the system
1103000	1105000	I think that's what they're probably going to have to do with this
1105000	1107000	If they do include it inside of a 360
1107000	1109000	I think it's going to be a dumb move
1109000	1111000	Hopefully
1111000	1113000	I hope they tested all this stuff
1113000	1115000	To make sure that the access times are the same
1115000	1117000	Because otherwise you're going to have a lot of problems reading games
1117000	1119000	What is it about this particular report though
1119000	1121000	Why I should believe it
1121000	1123000	I don't know
1123000	1125000	I think those people are just
1125000	1127000	Because I think that instead of just saying
1127000	1129000	Oh it's coming
1129000	1131000	It's saying hey there's going to be a
1131000	1133000	Press release tomorrow
1133000	1135000	That says duh duh duh duh
1135000	1137000	At this time so it's a lot easier to say
1137000	1139000	Okay well this is going to be true or false
1139000	1141000	Instead of speculating whether it's true or not
1141000	1143000	Now GK128 in our chat makes an interesting observation
1143000	1145000	He says the new iPhone
1145000	1147000	Is supposed to be tomorrow as well
1147000	1149000	That's half speculation
1149000	1151000	Half Apple fanboys
1151000	1153000	Always speak about this stuff in advance
1153000	1155000	So they're probably right
1155000	1157000	Well here's the thing
1157000	1159000	Tomorrow is the worldwide developers conference
1159000	1161000	So is this Microsoft's answer to Apple
1161000	1163000	In a way like hey Apple's making this big unveiling
1163000	1165000	And we're going to unveil Blu-ray in the home
1165000	1167000	Is that what maybe gives us a little weight
1167000	1169000	Maybe I don't know it'd just be weird
1169000	1171000	Unless you know Microsoft
1171000	1173000	I mean they're always kind of butting heads with Apple
1173000	1175000	And stuff maybe they're trying to
1175000	1177000	Get people on board with
1177000	1179000	Their video download service and stuff like that
1179000	1181000	I don't know
1181000	1183000	And you put the nail on the head there
1183000	1185000	When they have their download service
1185000	1187000	Alright they had the HD DVD player
1187000	1189000	And to be honest
1189000	1191000	I guess when I hear about Microsoft putting out a Blu-ray player
1191000	1193000	You remember in the old Charlie Brown
1193000	1195000	Comics when a character would get really upset
1195000	1197000	There'd be a little scribble drawn over their head
1197000	1199000	That's what I look like
1199000	1201000	When I keep thinking about how my HD DVD player
1201000	1203000	Pretty much I only have five movies
1203000	1205000	I'll ever be able to watch on it now
1205000	1207000	We can still find movies all over the place though
1207000	1209000	Usually really cheap
1209000	1211000	But to know that there's no more
1211000	1213000	Ever coming out on some of these newer movies
1213000	1215000	I might want to get
1215000	1217000	Well we found out they were clearing out
1217000	1219000	We went out and bought our player
1219000	1221000	But I bought my player full price
1221000	1223000	That's why I have angry
1223000	1225000	Angry face
1225000	1227000	Well there are always positives and negatives
1227000	1229000	To adopting early
1229000	1231000	I know I know
1231000	1233000	It just sucks
1233000	1235000	Keep in mind
1235000	1237000	Blu-ray being now the
1237000	1239000	Preferred method
1239000	1241000	Of high definition
1241000	1243000	Media
1243000	1245000	I'm expecting now to start seeing
1245000	1247000	More of the
1247000	1249000	Less expensive models coming out
1249000	1251000	Over the next year or so
1251000	1253000	So you'll have an easier
1253000	1255000	Time getting one in your hands
1255000	1257000	All the more reason not to buy this
1257000	1259000	I don't know
1259000	1261000	Well I'm not going to buy the Blu-ray player because I know
1261000	1263000	Eventually I'm going to get a PS3
1263000	1265000	I realize I'm the only OLR host without a PS3
1265000	1267000	And eventually I'm going to crack it
1267000	1269000	Well right now
1269000	1271000	I'm not but Final Fantasy 13
1271000	1273000	Is going to come out someday
1273000	1275000	I am a Final Fantasy
1275000	1277000	Fanboy I will be the first to admit
1277000	1279000	When it comes out I have no choice
1279000	1281000	I must upgrade to PS3
1281000	1283000	Even if the game sucks it's Final Fantasy
1283000	1285000	I have to get it
1285000	1287000	I did the same thing for Final Fantasy 7
1287000	1289000	I held out on getting a Sony
1289000	1291000	PlayStation for the longest time until Final Fantasy 7
1291000	1293000	Came out and then I finally caved and bought
1293000	1295000	One and I'm glad I did because you guys all know
1295000	1297000	Tons and tons of classic games on the PlayStation
1297000	1299000	I hope the PlayStation 3 has
1299000	1301000	A similar legacy but I don't know
1301000	1303000	We'll see
1303000	1305000	Rama and Chad agrees, Rob you're not missing anything
1305000	1307000	Hey before we get to the next story
1307000	1309000	I missed one housekeeping thing, I'm such a jerk
1309000	1311000	But it's because we were
1311000	1313000	In a hurry tonight with trying to set up all the new
1313000	1315000	Fancy stuff for Justin TV which didn't
1315000	1317000	Even end up working anyway, I forgot to script out
1317000	1319000	What's going on for housekeeping tonight but I wanted to mention this
1319000	1321000	Because I saw his name mentioned earlier
1321000	1323000	DJ, I'm sorry
1323000	1325000	Mark Tetsuya says
1325000	1327000	DJ Tetsuya
1327000	1329000	Maybe for tonight he's DJ Tetsuya
1329000	1331000	DJ Tetsuya said
1331000	1333000	That SSJ 100 Matt is to
1333000	1335000	Thank for a large part of how the
1335000	1337000	Wiki got reorganized so thank you SSJ 100 Matt
1337000	1339000	I also wanted to say as far as
1339000	1341000	SSJ 100 Matt goes that
1341000	1343000	The Grand Theft Auto 4
1343000	1345000	Contest was finally finished over
1345000	1347000	Allgames.com this week, all the votes came in
1347000	1349000	Sadly SSJ 100
1349000	1351000	Matt did not win the contest
1351000	1353000	I'm sure as you read
1353000	1355000	I'm sure as you read
1355000	1357000	They sent me the console instead because they knew
1357000	1359000	I was the appropriate owner
1359000	1361000	Of such a console
1361000	1363000	But I do have some good news
1363000	1365000	SSJ 100 Matt did tie for third place
1365000	1367000	So he does get something so that does kind of rock
1367000	1369000	So congratulations
1369000	1371000	The winner of the Grand Theft Auto 4
1371000	1373000	Contest was the Bobby Black Wolf show
1373000	1375000	And their little spoof on the Cheers ad that the guy made
1375000	1377000	And so he walked away with the
1377000	1379000	Limited edition
1379000	1381000	Xbox 360 and I got to admit
1381000	1383000	It was pretty funny
1383000	1385000	It was definitely worthy
1385000	1387000	We ended up voting for the Allgames Interactive one
1387000	1389000	Which tied for second place
1389000	1391000	Apparently, funny enough
1391000	1393000	Only one vote got
1393000	1395000	SSJ 100 Matt tied for third place
1395000	1397000	Because Bobby's show got like four votes
1397000	1399000	It was a runaway
1399000	1401000	But do you know which show voted for us?
1401000	1403000	Out of everybody?
1403000	1405000	Bobby
1405000	1407000	Because Bobby's the only one that probably
1407000	1409000	Understood all the in-jokes
1409000	1411000	That's great
1411000	1413000	So the winning show voted for us
1413000	1415000	I don't know what that says
1415000	1417000	But something to think about
1417000	1419000	Something to think about
1419000	1421000	Let's move on to more news
1421000	1423000	Something else we like to think about
1423000	1425000	Are music based games
1425000	1427000	Lately music based games have been all about
1427000	1429000	Guitar Hero and Rock Band
1429000	1431000	A brand new Guitar Hero game is coming out
1431000	1433000	If you haven't heard, it's Guitar Hero Aerosmith
1433000	1435000	Guitar Hero Aerosmith is scheduled to come out very soon
1435000	1437000	And there are some songs
1437000	1439000	That have been announced for the game
1439000	1441000	I'm disappointed
1441000	1443000	Well let me tell the songs first
1443000	1445000	I want Fog Hat edition
1445000	1447000	Tell your frustration
1447000	1449000	We'll just give it a couple more years
1449000	1451000	I'm sure that one of the billion releases will be the Fog Hat edition
1451000	1453000	You get to play in such places as Nipmuc High School
1453000	1455000	Maxis, Kansas City
1455000	1457000	The Orpheum Theater, Halftime Show
1457000	1459000	And Moscow
1459000	1461000	Which is kind of cool that you get to play at places
1461000	1463000	You know, like
1463000	1465000	Aerosmith kind of played in, that's cute
1465000	1467000	Some of the Aerosmith songs you can look forward to playing
1467000	1469000	Sweet Emotion
1469000	1471000	Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' an Elevator
1471000	1473000	Dream On, Walk This Way
1473000	1475000	And that is the version featuring Run DMC
1475000	1477000	That's pretty rad
1477000	1479000	And there's some other bands in the game too
1479000	1481000	Funny enough, there's not a lot of the other bands
1481000	1483000	Well I guess in a game called Guitar Hero Aerosmith
1483000	1485000	It shouldn't be that surprising
1485000	1487000	It usually breaks down that there's three Aerosmith songs in the stage
1487000	1489000	And two other band songs
1489000	1491000	And some of the other bands you'll see
1491000	1493000	Cheap Trick with Dream Police
1493000	1495000	Joan Jett, I Hate Myself for Lovin' You
1495000	1497000	The Clash, Complete Control
1497000	1499000	Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run
1499000	1501000	And Run DMC with King of Rock
1501000	1503000	So
1503000	1505000	That's some of the stuff you have to look forward to
1505000	1507000	In Guitar Hero Aerosmith
1507000	1509000	Which is coming out for the Playstation 3, 360
1509000	1511000	And Playstation 2
1511000	1513000	And if just the game wasn't enough, once you know it
1513000	1515000	Bundles coming out as well
1515000	1517000	So no excuses to say
1517000	1519000	You can't play this game unless you just don't like Guitar Hero
1519000	1521000	Or Aerosmith
1521000	1523000	I like Aerosmith
1523000	1525000	Or if you're not a consumer whore and realize
1525000	1527000	Hey guess what?
1527000	1529000	You can just wait a few more months and get an actual sequel to the game
1529000	1531000	Oh Loki
1531000	1533000	Achievements
1533000	1535000	A thousand points worth
1535000	1537000	I'm not fucking playing that
1537000	1539000	I do like Aerosmith though
1539000	1541000	But I will
1541000	1543000	I don't know
1543000	1545000	Not buying a game just with Aerosmith
1545000	1547000	Cause that's almost like buying an album
1547000	1549000	I don't wanna buy albums anymore
1549000	1551000	That's a lot of album though
1551000	1553000	That's like 15 songs
1553000	1555000	Well I guess that's a normal album, nevermind
1555000	1557000	See what they're doing?
1557000	1559000	Now we're charging you $50 for an album
1559000	1561000	They will never know what's actually happening
1561000	1563000	You don't get to actually play your album
1563000	1565000	Then again it's not real guitar
1565000	1567000	I'm not making a good case here
1567000	1569000	Help Chat Room
1569000	1571000	Guitar Hero Fans
1571000	1573000	Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith
1573000	1575000	Ready? Go!
1575000	1579000	The next story has to do with something that rather excites me
1579000	1581000	One of my favorite game series ever
1581000	1583000	And I'm not saying Metal Slug
1583000	1585000	But it's Samurai Showdown
1585000	1587000	They actually said
1587000	1589000	Well from the ESRB
1589000	1591000	That Xbox Live Arcade
1591000	1593000	Would be getting Samurai Showdown 2
1593000	1597000	And also now they're saying they should be getting Samurai Showdown
1597000	1601000	I suppose they mean they're getting them separately
1601000	1603000	But
1603000	1605000	There's no news beyond what
1605000	1607000	There's been on the ESRB
1607000	1609000	So we can hope
1609000	1611000	That they'll be all jazzed up and pretty
1611000	1615000	Are we gonna get like all the Samurai Showdown games?
1615000	1617000	Cause that's kind of a lot
1617000	1619000	What's so special about 5?
1619000	1621000	5 is the last cartridge that was released
1621000	1623000	On the Neo Geo cartridge system
1623000	1625000	And I've never played it
1625000	1627000	And I want it
1627000	1631000	I want Samurai Showdown HD Remix
1631000	1633000	You can do Samurai Showdown 5 HD Remix
1633000	1635000	I want Samurai Showdown 2 though
1635000	1637000	Most of all cause that one was like the best
1637000	1639000	Huh
1639000	1641000	They had caffeine nicotine
1643000	1645000	Nice
1645000	1647000	Going back to the question that we asked earlier
1647000	1649000	Justify Guitar Hero Aerosmith
1649000	1651000	Let's see, Kitsune says
1651000	1653000	I'm not too thrilled about the new Guitar Hero
1653000	1657000	AJ Mix says it's not Guitar Hero Blink 182
1657000	1659000	Kitsune follows up and says
1659000	1661000	I think my husband might get it for the 360
1661000	1663000	Robert M says
1663000	1665000	I still can't find many of the Aerosmith songs on iTunes
1665000	1667000	Gerardo says
1667000	1669000	Guitar Hero Aerosmith, why?
1669000	1671000	Because Guitar Hero makes it money
1671000	1673000	Let's see, GS68 is hoping for
1673000	1675000	Guitar Hero Loki Fusion
1675000	1677000	I don't know about that one
1677000	1679000	Well here's the thing
1679000	1681000	Activision is starting to get like
1681000	1683000	Before people were saying, oh you're really hoarding this franchise
1683000	1685000	Well now they're just
1685000	1687000	Not even trying to pretend that they're not
1687000	1689000	They are just coming out with
1689000	1691000	Oh by the way, hey if you don't want this
1691000	1693000	Guitar Hero game, don't worry cause there's like four
1693000	1695000	Other ones coming out within the foreseeable future
1695000	1697000	Last couple comments
1697000	1699000	GK128 says Guitar Hero
1699000	1701000	Insert band name here will always be a rental
1701000	1703000	Unless it's something badass like Pixies or
1703000	1705000	Dinosaur Jr. which you must be fanboys of
1705000	1707000	Frisbee says
1707000	1709000	Make Aerosmith a download pack
1709000	1711000	And AZHP says
1711000	1713000	It'll only be worth it if you actually like Aerosmith
1713000	1715000	Aerosmith's kinda cool though
1715000	1717000	I think what I'm talking about is
1717000	1719000	Rockband has it figured out with the download packs
1719000	1721000	Problem they're gonna run into with that though
1721000	1723000	Is what they do for Rockband 2
1723000	1725000	Because now you have like
1725000	1727000	Rockband with all these songs
1727000	1729000	And you can't
1729000	1731000	Here, make all the old songs that you've already downloaded compatible
1731000	1733000	Hopefully they do
1733000	1735000	Just like they did with EDR
1735000	1737000	And that's how they could sell more Guitar Hero Aerosmiths
1737000	1739000	Is by saying, okay well all those download songs
1739000	1741000	That you had will be compatible with this game
1741000	1743000	Or you can download more
1743000	1745000	And have them compatible with both games
1745000	1747000	That would be smart
1747000	1749000	Which is why they're not gonna do it
1749000	1751000	Nintendo Maniac 64 says
1751000	1753000	This is what we need, Guitar Hero F-Zero
1753000	1755000	I'm not sure how that would work
1755000	1757000	But it sounds good in theory
1757000	1759000	It would be just like
1759000	1761000	You know, the Rockband commercial where they're
1761000	1763000	On top of the bus, you know, playing their music
1763000	1765000	But on top of an F-Zero
1765000	1767000	That's the intro to the game, isn't it?
1767000	1769000	What's that? That's the intro to the game
1769000	1771000	I know, I know
1771000	1773000	But still, that would be Guitar Hero F-Zero
1773000	1775000	It's playing music really fast
1775000	1777000	On a really, really, really fast car
1777000	1779000	Flying through the air
1779000	1781000	Or maybe instead of that normal note track you have
1781000	1783000	You're actually on a car that's racing down
1783000	1785000	One of those super fast F-Zero tracks
1785000	1787000	Doing loops and stuff
1787000	1789000	And you have to read the notes off that
1789000	1791000	That'd be kind of fun
1791000	1793000	You know what would be cool?
1793000	1795000	Is to actually combine
1795000	1797000	The play levels for frequency
1797000	1799000	With Rockband
1799000	1801000	Wouldn't that be fun?
1801000	1803000	And so
1803000	1805000	As you play through it, you twist up
1805000	1807000	The path that they take and
1807000	1809000	Form new designs and
1809000	1811000	Get new effects that way
1811000	1813000	Or if you really want an obscure reference
1813000	1815000	You can just make a Guitar Hero
1815000	1817000	Action game that's based off of
1817000	1819000	Macross 7
1819000	1821000	Yeah, that would be great!
1821000	1823000	You get more points if you scream out
1823000	1825000	Listen to my song, dammit
1825000	1827000	For those of us who are familiar
1827000	1829000	With Macross 7
1829000	1831000	All the mechs were based around music
1831000	1833000	Rob, one of the biggest
1833000	1835000	Points in Macross was that music
1835000	1837000	Had a lot of power, which was how
1837000	1839000	In the very first series, spoiler!
1839000	1841000	You know, 20 years later
1841000	1843000	How in the first series they defeated the enemies
1843000	1845000	That came by was because of stupid butt-head
1845000	1847000	Mid-may
1847000	1849000	And so Macross 7 is sort of a big play-off
1849000	1851000	Of the whole music is power thing
1851000	1853000	I gotta tell you though
1853000	1855000	Going back to F-Zero for a minute
1855000	1857000	I wanted to actually put in F-Zero GX
1857000	1859000	And play it a little bit because it's still one of my favorite racers
1859000	1861000	And I think I said this over on Bobby's show
1861000	1863000	When we were doing the tees tonight
1863000	1865000	There aren't a lot of racing games I really like outside
1865000	1867000	Of F-Zero because F-Zero is fast
1867000	1869000	And it's horrifically simple
1869000	1871000	Like, that's what I like in a racing game
1871000	1873000	I like Burnout because Burnout is fast too
1873000	1875000	And it has explosions
1875000	1877000	There's not a lot of racing games I really, really love
1877000	1879000	If they made a Burnout arcade game that would be pretty awesome
1879000	1881000	That would be pretty awesome
1881000	1883000	Alright, let's move on with more news
1883000	1885000	So, of course
1885000	1887000	Me being a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto
1887000	1889000	Was a little bit disappointed to hear
1889000	1891000	That the Grand Theft Auto
1891000	1893000	Download content that's been promised for me
1893000	1895000	Has been delayed to Fiscal Quarter 1 2009
1895000	1897000	What's that mean?
1897000	1899000	Well, that means
1899000	1901000	That it's due between November 1, 2008
1901000	1903000	And January 31, 2009
1903000	1905000	Which when you look at it
1905000	1907000	It's not really that bad anyways
1907000	1909000	But hey, still though
1909000	1911000	I wish it was out a little bit sooner
1911000	1913000	Because, you know
1913000	1915000	Because sooner is better!
1915000	1917000	Exactly! And because you know
1917000	1919000	I'm almost done with the game
1919000	1921000	I need more achievements
1921000	1923000	And also I need more stuff to do
1923000	1925000	I hope they add tanks
1925000	1927000	What about multiplayer?
1927000	1929000	Multiplayer is fun
1929000	1931000	Having some lag issues
1931000	1933000	Well, not really lag issues
1933000	1935000	But like disconnect issues
1935000	1937000	But still love it
1937000	1939000	Love the multiplayer
1939000	1941000	We want to do instead of just killing each other
1941000	1943000	We want to do like a team of four
1943000	1945000	And go against another team of four
1945000	1947000	You know, because our office would kick ass
1947000	1949000	But so far it has
1949000	1951000	Cock blocked this from doing such
1951000	1953000	It's like, nope, sorry
1953000	1955000	You can't connect to anything
1955000	1957000	Fuck you, bye
1957000	1959000	I don't know
1959000	1961000	That's a really in depth message
1961000	1963000	Yeah, hey
1963000	1965000	I was surprised to see that pop up too
1965000	1967000	But you know, that's just how they roll
1967000	1969000	How they roll
1969000	1971000	Yeah, it's alright though
1971000	1973000	Because if the download content comes out later
1973000	1975000	That gives me time to play Saints Row 2
1975000	1977000	In the middle, and oh god I want that game too
1977000	1979000	You know, I don't think Saints Row 2
1979000	1981000	Came up on our show roll at all tonight
1981000	1983000	Maybe it's because we talked a little bit about the delay last week
1983000	1985000	But I guess a new trailer came out this week
1985000	1987000	And it caused somebody, and I apologize I'm not crediting this
1987000	1989000	But I don't have our forums up right now
1989000	1991000	Somebody went to the forums and actually posted
1991000	1993000	Dude, this looks like Loki the game
1993000	1995000	I didn't watch the new trailer
1995000	1997000	What's so great about it?
1997000	1999000	What they were doing, the whole trailer was comparing
1999000	2001000	Grand Theft Auto 4 with Saints Row 2
2001000	2003000	And mainly it was a trailer highlighting
2003000	2005000	The side missions you can do in the game
2005000	2007000	Because the side stuff you can do in Grand Theft Auto 4
2007000	2009000	You know, they have like
2009000	2011000	Bowling and playing pool and darts
2011000	2013000	And stuff like that
2013000	2015000	Well, they were showing
2015000	2017000	Oh hey, you can go and spray sewage
2017000	2019000	On people, you know
2019000	2021000	Or you can do insurance fraud
2021000	2023000	With co-op and throw people in front of trains
2023000	2025000	Or you can streak through the neighborhood
2025000	2027000	Or you can rob stores
2027000	2029000	And do all sorts of crazy stuff like that
2029000	2031000	Hey, you know what
2031000	2033000	Me being a fan of both games
2033000	2035000	Both are great in their own aspects
2035000	2037000	They're just different
2037000	2039000	It's like Star Wars and Spaceballs
2039000	2041000	So competition is healthy
2041000	2043000	Exactly, you know, I'm glad to see
2043000	2045000	Because a lot of the stuff that came from Saints Row
2045000	2047000	Ended up making it into
2047000	2049000	Grand Theft Auto 4
2049000	2051000	The whole
2051000	2053000	Their navigation systems
2053000	2055000	Pretty much the same as Saints Row
2055000	2057000	Using the cell phone for all the cheats
2057000	2059000	And stuff like that
2059000	2061000	A lot from Saints Row
2061000	2063000	Just, you know, the multiplayer
2063000	2065000	Probably pushed them a little bit more
2065000	2067000	To do multiplayer on the platform, which is good
2067000	2069000	So, you know,
2069000	2071000	Competition is good, I like to see that
2071000	2073000	And also because Grand Theft Auto came out
2073000	2075000	That pushed Saints Row to add flying vehicles
2075000	2077000	And stuff like that, so
2077000	2079000	I don't care, they're both awesome
2079000	2081000	You don't have to pick one
2081000	2109000	Alright, if you want to check out the Saints Row 2 trailer
2109000	2111000	11 million copies sold to retailers
2111000	2113000	So yes, that means about 2.5 million
2113000	2115000	Are sitting on store shelves right now
2115000	2117000	Waiting to be scooped up through the holiday season
2117000	2119000	That was all reported in Take 2's
2119000	2121000	Second Quarter Financials reported earlier this week
2121000	2123000	So, not too shabby
2123000	2125000	11 million units sold to retailers
2125000	2127000	Take 2
2127000	2129000	Very happy campers right now
2129000	2131000	Extremely happy campers
2131000	2133000	I wish I could sell 11 million
2133000	2135000	Units of one of my dream games
2135000	2139000	I'd be rich, I'd never have to work again
2139000	2141000	Although we all know, I'm telling you, if Laser Cats the game came out
2141000	2143000	That's like 25 million
2143000	2145000	25 billion
2145000	2147000	Units
2147000	2149000	I don't care, there's not that many people in the world
2149000	2151000	But everybody would buy like 5 copies because it would be that awesome
2151000	2153000	Don't you think?
2153000	2155000	I smell another ET
2155000	2157000	Uh oh
2157000	2159000	You know, speaking of ET
2159000	2161000	This is going to sound so random
2161000	2163000	But I don't care, I'm in a mood tonight
2163000	2165000	I was on Wikipedia this week
2165000	2167000	Reading about old school Atari games
2167000	2169000	Like ET and Pac-Man
2169000	2171000	And like why they failed
2171000	2173000	And it was fascinating
2173000	2175000	I don't know, just kind of reading up on my video game history
2175000	2177000	I think it's good to brush up on your video game history once in a while
2177000	2179000	Because you played ET and you're like
2179000	2181000	How does anything like the movie?
2181000	2183000	I don't get this
2183000	2185000	I didn't get it when I was 5
2185000	2187000	I don't get it now
2187000	2189000	Forget it
2189000	2191000	Can I do my story?
2191000	2193000	Um, more Xbox Live
2193000	2195000	Arcade news is
2195000	2197000	Uh, Commando 3
2197000	2199000	That's Wolf of the Battlefield
2199000	2201000	Is going to be on
2201000	2203000	Xbox Live Arcade as of I believe next Wednesday
2203000	2205000	And will be 800 points
2205000	2207000	And it also has an
2207000	2209000	Invite to Super Street Fighter 2
2209000	2211000	Turbo HD Remix beta
2211000	2213000	So
2213000	2215000	So I wonder how many percentage of the purchasers
2215000	2217000	Of Commando 3 are actually trying to get the beta
2217000	2219000	Like what happened with
2219000	2221000	Crackdown and the Halo 3 beta
2221000	2223000	Crackdown was pretty awesome
2223000	2225000	But Crackdown was a pretty good game
2225000	2227000	So hopefully Commando 3 is a pretty good game as well
2227000	2229000	That would make it very worth it
2229000	2231000	But I'm not a big fan of all these 800
2231000	2233000	Price points lately
2233000	2235000	Whatever happened to the $5 games?
2235000	2237000	When was the last time we got a $5 game?
2237000	2239000	Oh wait, we had like Warlords and stuff
2239000	2241000	I guess that wasn't really worth it though
2241000	2243000	Well now that Penny Arcade came out for 1600 points
2243000	2245000	Everyone's like, Hey!
2245000	2247000	That game sells really well, it's $20
2247000	2249000	Do anybody think there's a reason?
2249000	2251000	Ah forget it
2251000	2253000	They won't put 2 and 2 together
2253000	2255000	Well we'll see
2255000	2257000	If you don't want to download that
2257000	2259000	There are some other things you can download
2259000	2261000	Especially if you own Guitar Hero 3
2261000	2263000	We're going to have some new Motorhead
2263000	2265000	Tracks coming out
2265000	2267000	It's going to be part of
2267000	2269000	A series of tracks that they're going to have
2269000	2271000	Coming out in June
2271000	2273000	So the Motorhead Track Pack
2273000	2275000	Which will be available June 5th
2275000	2277000	I guess that's already come out then
2277000	2279000	Includes, We Are The Road Crew
2279000	2281000	Stay Clean and of course
2281000	2283000	Motorhead
2283000	2285000	And is available for 500 Microsoft points
2285000	2287000	Or $6.25
2287000	2289000	In real money
2289000	2291000	The track that's coming out next week
2291000	2293000	Which is the Isle of Wight
2293000	2295000	That is coming out June 12th
2295000	2297000	The price has been unconfirmed
2297000	2299000	But it's probably going to be also 500 Microsoft points
2299000	2301000	Includes, Shoot The Runner by
2301000	2303000	Cosbian
2303000	2305000	I Predict The Riot by Kaiser Chiefs
2305000	2307000	And Problems by the Sex Pistols
2307000	2309000	So that's pretty awesome
2309000	2311000	Alright
2311000	2313000	Well also speaking of ever expanding
2313000	2315000	Games, Soul Calibur 4
2315000	2317000	The roster of players just keeps
2317000	2319000	Growing and growing
2319000	2321000	And interestingly enough
2321000	2323000	When we got Darth Vader and Yoda
2323000	2325000	Announced for Soul Calibur 4
2325000	2327000	People were kind of like, oh haha that's cute
2327000	2329000	We're going to have these Star Wars characters
2329000	2331000	In the game that's going to be
2331000	2333000	Kind of random
2333000	2335000	But here's the weird thing
2335000	2337000	Another Star Wars character
2337000	2339000	Has been added to the Soul Calibur 4
2339000	2341000	Roster
2341000	2343000	So this is suddenly starting to feel like Star Wars
2343000	2345000	Versus Soul Calibur or something weird
2345000	2347000	Which I would not disapprove of
2347000	2349000	I guess that's true
2349000	2351000	It's kind of neat in a weird way
2351000	2353000	It's just weird
2353000	2355000	I'll say it again
2355000	2357000	After I've played the game, we'll see
2357000	2359000	But here's the deal
2359000	2361000	The Secret Apprentice
2361000	2363000	Is going to be in both versions of
2363000	2365000	Soul Calibur 4
2365000	2367000	Darth Vader is only going to be in the PS3
2367000	2369000	However the Secret Apprentice
2369000	2371000	Now the Secret Apprentice comes from
2371000	2373000	Star Wars The Force Unleashed
2373000	2375000	This guy is actually going to be
2375000	2377000	In Soul Calibur 4
2377000	2379000	So check that out
2379000	2381000	When that game comes out a little later this year
2381000	2383000	You know they need to put Bob Barker
2383000	2385000	Into a fighting game
2385000	2387000	Uh huh
2387000	2389000	Bob Barker needs to be in a fighting game
2389000	2391000	I mean that would be pretty badass
2391000	2393000	Immortalize him, put him in another Soul Calibur game
2393000	2395000	Soul Calibur versus Happy Gilmore
2395000	2397000	I don't know about that
2397000	2399000	No, just like TV show hosts
2399000	2401000	Just throw them in, random, it doesn't have to make any sense
2401000	2403000	The Star Wars stuff doesn't make any sense
2403000	2405000	Just throw it in
2405000	2407000	So if it's TV show hosts, can he like beat up Rosie O'Donnell
2407000	2409000	And Barbara Walters
2409000	2411000	Yeah sure, anything can happen
2411000	2413000	Bob Barker, don't you know that he's held together by Clay
2413000	2415000	And that formula from Death Becomes Her
2415000	2417000	Celebrity Death Match
2417000	2419000	That already was a game, wasn't it?
2419000	2421000	Speaking of characters held together by Clay
2421000	2423000	I know, really
2423000	2425000	Maybe they just need Celebrity Death Match 2
2425000	2427000	That would be great
2427000	2429000	But you know what they should have if they did something like that
2429000	2431000	Is have download characters
2431000	2433000	And have it, you know, where you could
2433000	2435000	Customize, you know
2435000	2437000	They have like, you know, like they do in the wrestling games
2437000	2439000	So you can make different, you know
2439000	2441000	People, you know, mimic them
2441000	2443000	In wrestling games, you should have something like that
2443000	2445000	Like Celebrity Death Match
2445000	2447000	Could be, make your own celebrity
2447000	2449000	See what they need to do, they need to have more games
2449000	2451000	I'm a celebrity, dammit
2451000	2453000	I want to put myself in the game
2453000	2455000	I'm an internet celebrity, I have a pen that says so
2455000	2457000	What they need to do is have more games that have that kind of same humor
2457000	2459000	As like Kung Fu Hustle, kind of like God Hand
2459000	2461000	Where it's just ridiculous
2461000	2463000	And more of like an anime style, you know
2463000	2465000	That was more of a brawling game
2465000	2467000	But, you know, more of like a fighting game
2467000	2469000	With some like funny characters that are just really exaggerated
2469000	2471000	And stuff like that
2471000	2474000	Star Wars vs. Soul Calibur gets a lot of reaction from chat
2474000	2476000	Let's check this out, Gerardo says
2476000	2478000	Star Wars GTFO of my Soul Calibur
2478000	2480000	Go get your own fighting game
2480000	2482000	No, they already did that
2482000	2484000	And that didn't turn out too well either
2484000	2486000	The Terrace
2486000	2488000	Then let Namco do it
2488000	2490000	Well, actually though, they're going to be doing something
2490000	2492000	With the Force Unleashed on the Wii
2492000	2494000	Is going to have like a fighting game portion of it
2494000	2496000	Why don't they just put a Star Wars game
2496000	2498000	That's based off the Soul Calibur engine
2498000	2500000	GS68 says this is Soul Calibur
2500000	2502000	Not fucking Star Wars Calibur
2502000	2504000	Cheeseburger says Chuck Norris in Soul Calibur
2504000	2506000	Will roundhouse kick everyone
2506000	2508000	I dig that, he doesn't have a sword
2508000	2510000	He just has his roundhouse kicks
2510000	2512000	Why not, GS68 says
2512000	2514000	Luckily if anyone picks a Star Wars character
2514000	2516000	I'll pick Ivy and suffocate them to death
2516000	2518000	Sounds like fun
2518000	2520000	I'd be like Boob Smash
2520000	2522000	Exactly, chat.ornisontraday.com
2522000	2524000	Is it my turn now, is it, is it, is it?
2524000	2526000	It is
2526000	2528000	Yay, um, well
2528000	2530000	I'm sure people who've listened to this show
2530000	2532000	For quite a while now know that I have an interest in law
2532000	2534000	I love
2534000	2536000	What
2536000	2538000	But you are the law
2538000	2539000	Rob
2539000	2541000	What?
2541000	2543000	You know, I think that's an unhealthy obsession
2543000	2545000	That you have there with Tekken
2545000	2547000	I was just waiting for her to go
2547000	2549000	I am the law
2549000	2551000	I do have a Judge Dredd pinball machine
2551000	2553000	In my house, thank you very much
2553000	2555000	But um
2555000	2557000	One of the former Supreme Court judges
2557000	2559000	Sandra Day O'Connor
2559000	2561000	Is wanting to make a game
2561000	2563000	That teaches court lessons
2563000	2565000	It's called Our Courts
2565000	2567000	It's a free game for kids between 12 and 15
2567000	2569000	And it basically
2569000	2571000	Lets you learn how
2571000	2573000	Courtrooms work, what the system is like
2573000	2575000	And learn
2575000	2577000	You know, actual legal issues
2577000	2579000	When I was in school
2579000	2581000	We used to do
2581000	2583000	Court simulations
2583000	2585000	Using modern day
2585000	2587000	I guess
2587000	2589000	The modern day courtroom system
2589000	2591000	To judge
2591000	2593000	Historical acts, like I got to be Marie Antoinette
2593000	2595000	So I had to be really
2595000	2597000	Awesome
2597000	2599000	Did they behead you?
2599000	2601000	First and foremost
2601000	2603000	Don't get me started on the French Revolution
2603000	2605000	Because
2605000	2607000	No one wants to hear about that
2607000	2609000	Keep in mind
2609000	2611000	I'm a history buff
2611000	2613000	I love my history
2613000	2615000	Look, here, I'll retard the conversation
2615000	2617000	A little bit
2617000	2619000	You know what we did in our school to practice courtroom?
2619000	2621000	What?
2621000	2623000	We watched Nickelodeon Kids Court hosted by Paul Provenza
2623000	2625000	That's what we did
2625000	2627000	Oh
2627000	2629000	The other thing that we also did at my school
2629000	2631000	Was model United Nations
2631000	2633000	And I got to be on the Security Council my senior year
2633000	2635000	And that was freaking badass
2635000	2637000	Because I had to tell both China and the US to shut up
2637000	2639000	What country did you represent?
2639000	2641000	Hungary
2641000	2643000	It was great
2643000	2645000	Hungary was on the Security Council that year
2645000	2647000	Considering that your life has evolved into
2647000	2649000	A food podcast
2649000	2651000	That sometimes talks about video games
2651000	2653000	That's really funny that you represented
2653000	2655000	Hungary
2655000	2657000	Oh come on
2657000	2659000	Home of the Habsburgs
2659000	2661000	Anyway
2661000	2663000	You can't write this shit you guys
2663000	2665000	It's all true
2665000	2667000	So anyway
2667000	2669000	It's basically
2669000	2671000	An educational game
2671000	2673000	Supposed to be put out so that children
2673000	2675000	Have a better understanding of how
2675000	2677000	The government works without having to
2677000	2679000	You know see the
2679000	2681000	Sort of farcical side of
2681000	2683000	Law enforcement with Grand Theft Auto
2683000	2685000	And those types of things
2685000	2687000	You know to actually see
2687000	2689000	Where your duties come in
2689000	2691000	I guess as far as
2691000	2693000	Participating in the system
2693000	2695000	I think it's a neat idea
2695000	2697000	And honestly it's something that I myself
2697000	2699000	Look into because I have
2699000	2701000	An interest in it
2701000	2703000	I've taken a number of law classes
2703000	2705000	Through my various majors
2705000	2707000	Didn't you say it was only for kids 12-15?
2707000	2709000	It's targeted
2709000	2711000	It's actually to be
2711000	2713000	Offered free to children
2713000	2715000	12-15 years old
2715000	2717000	I know some people 25 years old that could benefit
2717000	2719000	From that game
2719000	2721000	I want to give it a try
2721000	2723000	She's actually quoted saying
2723000	2725000	It will allow students to engage in
2725000	2727000	Real legal issues
2727000	2729000	And it gives an example of
2729000	2731000	A debate by someone
2731000	2733000	Wearing a controversial t-shirt
2733000	2735000	So I guess freedom of speech versus
2735000	2737000	You know how
2737000	2739000	Stupidly offended everybody in this
2739000	2741000	Country gets over people
2741000	2743000	Sneezing the wrong way
2743000	2745000	Sorry
2745000	2747000	Robert M. makes the mandatory Phoenix Wright reference
2747000	2749000	By saying hold it
2749000	2751000	Yes hold it
2751000	2753000	Anyways
2753000	2755000	So
2755000	2757000	This is kind of interesting
2757000	2759000	There's been a couple stories
2759000	2761000	That have come out recently about
2761000	2763000	Different gaming surveys
2763000	2765000	And oh my god what it means and stuff like that
2765000	2767000	Yeah I have never seen anything about this
2767000	2769000	And this just totally slipped under the radar
2769000	2771000	For everybody I think
2771000	2773000	Anyways
2773000	2775000	There was a survey that went out to
2775000	2777000	Select people in the
2777000	2779000	Microsoft game studio
2779000	2781000	And it was a survey
2781000	2783000	Talking about different
2783000	2785000	Characters and what you thought about them
2785000	2787000	And stuff like that
2787000	2789000	Now the survey was for
2789000	2791000	What they describe basically
2791000	2793000	Here's their description of it
2793000	2795000	This game will be a game creator
2795000	2797000	And will provide a simple way to make
2797000	2799000	Your own games on the Xbox
2799000	2801000	Using just the Xbox controller
2801000	2803000	You can build worlds, populate
2803000	2805000	Them with characters and give the characters
2805000	2807000	Unique behaviors
2807000	2809000	You can easily build racing games
2809000	2811000	Platformers and adventure games without
2811000	2813000	Touching a keyboard or leaving your couch
2813000	2815000	So this is either XNA for dummies
2815000	2817000	Or little big planet thing
2817000	2819000	Exactly
2819000	2821000	Well what this is
2821000	2823000	Through the process of
2823000	2825000	Deduction I should say
2825000	2827000	It's a game called
2827000	2829000	Or not even really a game
2829000	2831000	A programming language called Boku
2831000	2833000	And Boku which you'll find out
2833000	2835000	There actually are stories out there on the internet
2835000	2837000	I'm not exactly breaking any news here
2837000	2839000	Boku is a programming
2839000	2841000	Environment for children that runs on
2841000	2843000	Windows and the Xbox 360
2843000	2845000	And basically what makes it
2845000	2847000	Kind of different is it
2847000	2849000	Uses basically
2849000	2851000	Symbols like you have different objects
2851000	2853000	For each symbol and you have
2853000	2855000	Kind of actions
2855000	2857000	And then other objects
2857000	2859000	So you kind of tie them all together without any programming language
2859000	2861000	So say you have a creature that looks like
2861000	2863000	Pac-Man or something like that
2863000	2865000	The Pac-Man character
2865000	2867000	Eat dots
2867000	2869000	And so that character will now seek out
2869000	2871000	The dots and try to eat them or something like that
2871000	2873000	It's basically simple like that
2873000	2875000	But here's what I see
2875000	2877000	Happening with this
2877000	2879000	Sure they can make it just for children
2879000	2881000	But why not expand it to be a little bit more
2881000	2883000	Full featured and make it something that
2883000	2885000	Can compete with say
2885000	2887000	XNA, well not even really compete with
2887000	2889000	But compete along with
2889000	2891000	I was going to say you don't want to compete against yourself
2891000	2893000	With XNA or even say
2893000	2895000	Like a little big planet
2895000	2897000	There's a bunch of screenshots of
2897000	2899000	You know characters and stuff that they had out there
2899000	2901000	And there's some other like
2901000	2903000	Links and stories and stuff showing
2903000	2905000	The programming environment
2905000	2907000	And the characters look interesting
2907000	2909000	It's like everything from Pokemon looking characters
2909000	2911000	To I don't know
2911000	2913000	Just some strange looking shit
2913000	2915000	One of those things there looks like a pregnant Pac-Man ghost
2915000	2917000	I don't know what that is
2917000	2919000	Can you link that picture to our chat?
2919000	2921000	Looks like a pregnant Pac-Man ghost
2921000	2923000	But I just think it's really interesting
2923000	2925000	Now Dr. Seuss says
2925000	2927000	It sounds neat I wish there was a PC version
2927000	2929000	But this is something being developed across both platforms
2929000	2931000	It is going to be Windows and
2931000	2933000	For the 360
2933000	2935000	No idea though when it's going to be released
2935000	2937000	Or anything of that sense
2937000	2939000	But it looks like they're still working on it
2939000	2941000	If they're sending out surveys about this thing
2941000	2943000	Why has this only been a blip on the gaming radar?
2943000	2945000	I don't know
2945000	2947000	Do people think there's not going to be interest in this?
2947000	2949000	Or what is it?
2949000	2951000	The stuff that was covered here wasn't really in
2951000	2953000	It might have been just under the radar
2953000	2955000	Because there's no gaming related stuff
2955000	2957000	Kind of covered where this stuff was
2957000	2959000	It was basically at
2959000	2961000	The Microsoft Research Tech Fest
2961000	2963000	This came out in 2007
2963000	2965000	The Tech Fest 2007
2965000	2967000	So March of last year
2967000	2969000	Is when this
2969000	2971000	Originally was shown
2971000	2973000	And they only had it demoing
2973000	2975000	It was covered by WIRED
2975000	2977000	They actually had a
2977000	2979000	Little piece on it
2979000	2981000	But that's about it
2981000	2983000	I don't know
2983000	2985000	It's very very interesting
2985000	2987000	I don't know
2987000	2989000	It could be something that's coming soon
2989000	2991000	Something maybe they'll show at E3
2991000	2993000	But if they are working on it
2993000	2995000	I think it could be pretty big
2995000	2997000	Because a lot of this stuff
2997000	2999000	The whole game 3.0 crap that they're trying to push
2999000	3001000	Where it's all user created content
3001000	3003000	Why not make it like a game creator?
3003000	3005000	What, click and play?
3005000	3007000	This old Maxis PC
3007000	3009000	Game making software is actually pretty cool
3009000	3011000	Vaguely, I actually do remember that
3011000	3013000	It was pretty cool, but make something like that
3013000	3015000	Maybe like LittleBigPlanet almost
3015000	3017000	But you can make your own games
3017000	3019000	Using this software and then distribute them
3019000	3021000	To your friends or post them on
3021000	3023000	Some sort of integrated message board
3023000	3025000	Or something like that
3025000	3027000	They're going to do the same thing with Blastworks
3027000	3029000	Which is coming out this week
3029000	3031000	That game is going to be pretty awesome
3031000	3033000	This is the way
3033000	3035000	Things are going
3035000	3037000	I'll link that picture in chat
3037000	3039000	While you're waiting for more
3039000	3041000	Information on Boku
3041000	3043000	You can get some games a little bit sooner
3043000	3045000	Across the world, we like to cover release dates
3045000	3047000	We're going to start off in Japan tonight
3047000	3049000	Not a lot sadly coming out on the Xbox 360
3049000	3051000	This week, but if we look at the Playstation 3
3051000	3053000	Hello, Metal Gear Solid 4
3053000	3055000	Guns of the Patriots
3055000	3057000	It's this week in Japan, June 12
3057000	3059000	Is when you can get that
3059000	3061000	The Japanese language version
3061000	3063000	You can get over there, there's a premium pack
3063000	3065000	A special edition
3065000	3067000	You know all the goodies
3067000	3069000	Because people in Japan love their limited edition stuff
3069000	3071000	So that is all coming out for Metal Gear Solid 4
3071000	3073000	And honestly because of it
3073000	3075000	There's not a lot out there
3075000	3077000	That really wants to compete with it this week
3077000	3079000	Nintendo Wii has nothing coming out
3079000	3081000	Playstation 2 has nothing coming out
3081000	3083000	Now the Nintendo DS has a little bit
3083000	3085000	Coming out, but not a lot
3085000	3087000	A game called Breath
3087000	3089000	Oua Akaneiro is coming out on June 12th
3089000	3091000	As well as another Pachinko game
3091000	3093000	That has to do with Neon Genesis Evangelion
3093000	3095000	Is coming out
3095000	3097000	Just because we didn't have enough Evangelion
3097000	3099000	Games on the DS
3099000	3101000	But I'm looking at what this Breath game is all about
3101000	3103000	And trying to figure out what this is
3103000	3105000	It looks like an adventure game
3105000	3107000	I'm trying to figure out if it's another dating sim
3107000	3109000	Because it definitely looks like you have
3109000	3111000	Cute girls on the top screen
3111000	3113000	And text on the bottom screen
3113000	3115000	That's usually a good sign of a dating sim
3115000	3117000	And also coming out in Japan
3117000	3119000	Othello de Othello DS
3119000	3121000	Which I'm assuming is just the classic game
3121000	3123000	You might know as Reversi
3123000	3125000	Yeah, it is
3125000	3127000	Othello
3127000	3129000	The old school game
3129000	3131000	And also coming out on the Nintendo DS
3131000	3133000	Sekai wa Atashi de Mowateru
3133000	3135000	Is coming out
3135000	3137000	Which is a
3137000	3139000	RPG game
3139000	3141000	From Global A Entertainment
3141000	3143000	And quickly glancing to see
3143000	3145000	If there's anything on the PSP of note
3145000	3147000	Or if Metal Gear is just dominating
3147000	3149000	The Sony universe this week
3151000	3153000	Medical 91 for portable
3153000	3155000	Is listed for the Sony PSP
3155000	3157000	That is a game
3159000	3161000	It's not Trauma Center, I'll tell you that
3161000	3163000	It's an adventure game
3163000	3165000	There's no screenshots, I couldn't tell you more about that
3165000	3167000	But looks like there's one lone game
3167000	3169000	On the PSP this week, but otherwise
3169000	3171000	Not a lot wanting to compete with Metal Gear Solid 4
3171000	3173000	This week over in Japan
3173000	3175000	Well we do have our UK releases
3175000	3177000	If anyone is interested
3177000	3179000	We have on the 12th
3179000	3181000	Metal Gear Solid Online and
3181000	3183000	Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots
3183000	3185000	Don King presents Prize Fighter
3185000	3187000	Whatever, that's on the 13th

3203000	3205000	Alright

3221000	3223000	We've got
3223000	3225000	Backyard Baseball 09
3225000	3227000	On PlayStation 2 and the Wii
3227000	3229000	8 Hunter Detective Chronicles
3229000	3231000	On the DS
3231000	3233000	Looney Tunes Cartoon Conductor
3233000	3235000	That's the one if you may remember
3235000	3237000	That's a rip-off of
3237000	3239000	Elite Beat Agents
3239000	3241000	That will be coming out on the DS
3241000	3243000	My Fashion Studio, also on the DS

3253000	3255000	Prize Fighter
3255000	3257000	360
3257000	3259000	And finally, Blastworks
3259000	3261000	Build, Trade, and Destroy on the Wii
3261000	3263000	If you own a Wii, you must buy this game
3263000	3265000	I'm telling you right now, buy this fucking game
3265000	3267000	Huh
3267000	3269000	It's an awesome shooter game
3269000	3271000	Everything's customizable in it
3271000	3273000	You can build your own levels
3273000	3275000	I'm thinking we should run a contest based on it
3275000	3277000	But, you know
3277000	3279000	I don't know, it looks awesome
3279000	3281000	I plan on picking it up when it comes out
3281000	3283000	Alright
3283000	3285000	Tomiki Fighters, you mean?
3285000	3287000	Well yes, it's basic, well it's not exactly
3287000	3289000	Tomiki Fighters, they do have Tomiki Fighters
3289000	3291000	in there as an unlockable game
3291000	3293000	But it is completely rebuilt
3293000	3295000	And it's a lot more than just
3295000	3297000	Tomiki Fighters, it's not just a rip-off
3297000	3299000	It's got a lot of stuff to offer
3299000	3301000	So, definitely check it out
3301000	3303000	Did the company pay you to plug them?
3303000	3305000	No, the company does not pay me to plug it
3305000	3307000	I think it looks really good
3307000	3309000	And they're gonna have this whole Blastworks Depot
3309000	3311000	thing where you can upload and download objects
3311000	3313000	created by other people
3313000	3315000	For example, you can take this and make your own
3315000	3317000	Star Fox game
3317000	3319000	You can take this and make another Guardian Legends game
3319000	3321000	if you wanted to
3321000	3323000	Stuff like that
3323000	3325000	I think it has a lot of
3325000	3327000	Especially, everybody's into the whole customizing stuff
3327000	3329000	Making custom levels for Smash Brothers
3329000	3331000	That was pretty simple
3331000	3333000	Look at this, this thing, people should run with this
3333000	3335000	Alright
3335000	3337000	Well, hey, if you want to get something a little sooner
3337000	3339000	as in right now, the PlayStation Network
3339000	3341000	was created on Thursday and they added quite a bit
3341000	3343000	of new things
3343000	3345000	They added something called Core, which we're gonna talk a little more about in Part B

3381000	3383000	Also some new themes, a retro theme
3383000	3385000	has come out for the PlayStation 3
3385000	3387000	I'm not sure what type of retro that is
3387000	3389000	How retro could that be?
3389000	3391000	Maybe PS1 graphics
3391000	3393000	It's all Betamax
3393000	3395000	That should be kind of rad
3395000	3397000	It comes up with the beta logo
3397000	3399000	and then a bunch of
3399000	3401000	SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo 2
3401000	3403000	stuff in the PC

3413000	3415000	updates this week
3415000	3417000	Another thing that's been updated
3417000	3419000	is Sega's calendar

3421000	3423000	is going to be out in November
3423000	3425000	but other things people might have been
3425000	3427000	waiting on like Aliens
3427000	3429000	Colonial Marines
3429000	3431000	and Empire Total War
3431000	3433000	are both going to be out in 2009
3433000	3435000	But the Beijing
3435000	3437000	Olympics game is going to be out on the 27th
3437000	3439000	of June and on August 27th
3439000	3441000	is a
3441000	3443000	game called Space Siege which is by
3443000	3445000	GasPowered Games
3445000	3447000	Other things that are set to be out
3447000	3449000	is the Golden Axe
3449000	3451000	I guess a revamp
3451000	3453000	of it, Sonic Chronicles Bioware
3453000	3455000	Role Playing Game
3455000	3457000	and Picto Image DS
3457000	3459000	also
3459000	3461000	a sequel to
3461000	3463000	Yakuza
3463000	3465000	I hate to say this because I know Sega
3465000	3467000	is near and dear to your heart and I don't know how you feel
3467000	3469000	about this series but Golden Axe
3469000	3471000	was something that was way cooler when I was a kid
3471000	3473000	I love Golden Axe
3473000	3475000	I love Golden Axe the Duel a whole lot too
3475000	3477000	I went and I downloaded
3477000	3479000	the Genesis version on Virtual Console
3479000	3481000	and I was just kind of like
3481000	3483000	oh my god this game is like repetitive and boring
3483000	3485000	it was so much better when I was a kid
3485000	3487000	I don't know what it is
3487000	3489000	but somehow the charm, the magic was lost
3489000	3491000	maybe it was because I wasn't playing with friends
3491000	3493000	at a pizza joint
3493000	3495000	you know what I mean? Games like that are always much funner with friends
3495000	3497000	because couldn't you like hit each other in that game
3497000	3499000	like if you're on that little purple bird
3499000	3501000	looking thing you could hit your friends over
3501000	3503000	that was always pretty rad
3503000	3505000	yeah and that purple bird thing would be something that you're riding
3505000	3507000	like in
3507000	3509000	Golden Axe Beast Rider
3509000	3511000	well I do still think
3511000	3513000	you know what I always loved about Golden Axe
3513000	3515000	I would check out a revamped version of it
3515000	3517000	because you know what I always loved about Golden Axe
3517000	3519000	was the ending, wasn't the ending
3519000	3521000	the best thing ever in Golden Axe
3521000	3523000	where they actually came out of the arcade game
3525000	3527000	spoilers, sorry
3527000	3529000	I was gonna say
3529000	3531000	one of the games she forgot mentioning there
3531000	3533000	of course
3533000	3535000	we're gonna like this game on the Wii
3535000	3537000	uh
3537000	3539000	Someday Amigo, that's out this summer
3539000	3541000	nice
3541000	3543000	but only if there's like fake maracas
3543000	3545000	I love maracas
3545000	3547000	you know someone's gonna release
3547000	3549000	a maracas attachment
3549000	3551000	they will, they've talked about the little
3551000	3553000	plastic sleeves and silly things
3553000	3555000	and besides, if they don't
3555000	3557000	what a difference duct tape
3557000	3559000	and maracas can make
3559000	3561000	all you need to do is order more free
3561000	3563000	condoms for your controller
3563000	3565000	seriously, we should do
3565000	3567000	okay, you know what we should do?
3567000	3569000	the Orange Jones Radio edition maracas
3569000	3571000	I love it
3571000	3573000	and we make them out of paper mache
3573000	3575000	like you used to do in kindergarten
3575000	3577000	we'll get all the supplies at Michael's
3577000	3579000	we will, you can actually just buy gourds
3579000	3581000	and duct tape a gourd to it, that'd be fantastic
3583000	3585000	if you don't live
3585000	3587000	Michael's is all across the US, right?
3587000	3589000	I think so
3589000	3591000	it's a craft store, if you live abroad
3591000	3593000	even though you've visited a Michael's
3593000	3595000	let me just put it that way
3595000	3597000	it's a great little craft store
3597000	3599000	anyway, forget it
3599000	3601000	dude, okay, I've been spending so much time
3601000	3603000	with stuff I have to get at Michael's
3603000	3605000	that, okay
3605000	3607000	I'm gonna make maracas
3607000	3609000	just you watch, I'll make them
3609000	3611000	put it on YouTube and all that stuff
3611000	3613000	we have a YouTube channel we don't use for anything
3613000	3615000	your hands can be, right?
3615000	3617000	yeah, I've actually thought about buying
3617000	3619000	a tub of the fondant there one time
3619000	3621000	cause that stuff tastes like those animal cookies
3621000	3623000	but it's really not good for you
3623000	3625000	alright, forget it, move on, move on
3625000	3627000	so something that has nothing to do
3627000	3629000	with Michael's
3629000	3631000	unfortunately
3631000	3633000	it's, you know, sad to see
3633000	3635000	that Itagagi has
3635000	3637000	left Tecmo
3637000	3639000	so you're not gonna see
3639000	3641000	him helming anymore Ninja Gaiden
3641000	3643000	or Dead or Alive games
3643000	3645000	at least not with Team Ninja
3645000	3647000	I
3647000	3649000	I don't know why he left
3649000	3651000	but I guess just
3651000	3653000	you know
3653000	3655000	emotional distress
3655000	3657000	I guess
3657000	3659000	worsening personal relationships
3659000	3661000	and work environment
3661000	3663000	if I remember right, wasn't there something about unpaid overtime
3663000	3665000	too, or something that factored into it?
3665000	3667000	I'm sure there is
3667000	3669000	basically he's a very disgruntled employee right now
3669000	3671000	he's a rock star, he can't be like, you know, tied down
3671000	3673000	with a job and stuff, he has to be trashing hotel rooms
3673000	3675000	Itagaki is a fucking rock star
3675000	3677000	you don't see a lot of
3677000	3679000	gaming rock stars
3679000	3681000	Itagaki is a rock star
3681000	3683000	they need him to hang out with
3683000	3685000	say the guy that does the
3685000	3687000	Castlevania games
3687000	3689000	just like make this really kick ass
3689000	3691000	guitar wolf
3691000	3693000	programming team that just
3693000	3695000	fucking says, they come in
3695000	3697000	they kick over the microphone and they're like fuck this
3697000	3699000	you're buying our fucking game and everyone's like
3699000	3701000	hell yeah I am!
3701000	3703000	so that's how they need to do it
3703000	3705000	just like scare the crap
3705000	3707000	out of the press, that'd be awesome
3707000	3709000	just come in, set something on fire
3709000	3711000	throw it into the crowd
3711000	3713000	just like, that's how you
3713000	3715000	sell your game
3715000	3717000	women coming out and wearing
3717000	3719000	nothing but you know
3719000	3721000	skippy ass clothing, they don't fucking
3721000	3723000	care if it's offensive, they're just like
3723000	3725000	whatever man, just some fabric
3725000	3727000	they bought at Michael's, that's all
3727000	3729000	whip cream, that's it
3729000	3731000	just whip cream
3731000	3733000	barbecue condiments
3733000	3735000	Itagaki is a rock star
3735000	3737000	so he'll go on to doing something
3737000	3739000	I'm sure
3739000	3741000	just hopefully he doesn't decide to go
3741000	3743000	develop playground equipment
3743000	3745000	like a certain other people
3745000	3747000	unless the playground equipment
3747000	3749000	electrocutes children
3749000	3751000	that I can see
3751000	3753000	and has fake boobs that are on it
3753000	3755000	yeah yeah
3755000	3757000	that's what he does in the middle of the presentation
3757000	3759000	just a motorboat right there
3759000	3761000	busts out with that
3761000	3763000	buy our game
3767000	3769000	how come you never see someone like him
3769000	3771000	busted for destroying hotel rooms?
3771000	3773000	that's what I want to know
3773000	3775000	just wait for this year's E3
3775000	3777000	you know, that could be the rock band sequel
3777000	3779000	no, keep in mind
3779000	3781000	instead of
3781000	3783000	I don't know
3783000	3785000	but keep in mind
3785000	3787000	you have rock band the RPG
3787000	3789000	where you know, you go and you trash
3789000	3791000	hotel rooms and have groupies
3791000	3793000	and you know, that type of thing
3793000	3795000	wouldn't that be awesome?
3795000	3797000	how about video game rock band or something
3797000	3799000	because you could play as Itagaki
3799000	3801000	alright, maybe not
3801000	3803000	you know, Itagaki's got his own thing going on
3803000	3805000	he's cool
3805000	3807000	he wants to have champagne
3807000	3809000	and only green M&M's
3809000	3811000	if anyone gets that reference
3811000	3813000	that's awesome
3813000	3815000	by the way, if you get that reference
3815000	3817000	you're awesome
3817000	3819000	because that's a true rock star right there
3819000	3821000	somebody who fucking demands
3821000	3823000	only green M&M's
3823000	3825000	just to see if someone will do it
3825000	3827000	more points to somebody who gets that joke
3827000	3829000	alright, anyhow
3829000	3831000	what?
3831000	3833000	Africa
3833000	3835000	onto things less cool
3835000	3837000	actually, I take that back
3837000	3839000	because this game was kind of like the running joke
3839000	3841000	of E3 a couple years ago
3841000	3843000	because they didn't tell us anything about the game
3843000	3845000	there was nothing told about the game
3845000	3847000	well guess what, finally
3847000	3849000	finally with this game just around the corner
3849000	3851000	for release in Japan very soon
3851000	3853000	some details have come out about the game
3853000	3855000	Africa, you're going to be a photo journalist
3855000	3857000	and you can take pictures on foot
3857000	3859000	in a car or by air balloon
3859000	3861000	which is kind of rad, because you don't see hot air balloons
3861000	3863000	make many gaming appearances
3863000	3865000	and you can unlock
3865000	3867000	non-CG pictures
3867000	3869000	and actual research footage
3869000	3871000	of animals as you encounter animals
3871000	3873000	in-game
3873000	3875000	and it comes out on August 28th
3875000	3877000	you build up this animal library
3877000	3879000	well great, I would like to know as much as possible
3879000	3881000	about the things I'm running over in my jeep
3881000	3883000	I don't think
3883000	3885000	you can do that in the game
3885000	3887000	dammit
3887000	3889000	so basically it's Africa Snap
3889000	3891000	but it doesn't sound like it's on a track
3891000	3893000	it sounds kind of a whole lot cooler
3893000	3895000	it's going to be a trailer for the game
3895000	3897000	and with the graphics and all
3897000	3899000	I've got to say, it does look like
3899000	3901000	potentially, it's going to be a very kick-ass
3901000	3903000	I don't even know if you really call it a game
3903000	3905000	like a kick-ass thing
3905000	3907000	it looks really neat
3907000	3909000	I've got to say
3909000	3911000	so maybe we'll all end up eating crow
3911000	3913000	about making fun of this game at E3
3913000	3915000	a few years ago
3915000	3917000	but it actually looks kind of neat
3917000	3919000	so I want to check this out
3919000	3921000	right, and then Aya Judgment is going to be awesome too
3921000	3923000	oh wait, no, I mean you really got to check out the preview
3923000	3925000	it kind of, like the graphics look gorgeous
3925000	3927000	absolutely gorgeous
3927000	3929000	yeah, they do look gorgeous
3929000	3931000	great, what does it say about the gameplay?
3931000	3933000	nothing, exactly, and the gameplay could suck
3933000	3935000	and this game could still suck
3935000	3937000	but I'm just saying, there's hope
3937000	3939000	there is hope, before we had no hope
3939000	3941000	Africa was just the running joke
3941000	3943000	but now that we're finding out a little bit about it
3943000	3945000	it sounds interesting
3945000	3947000	exactly, just like Frisbee says in the chatroom
3947000	3949000	Africa equals Endless Ocean
3949000	3951000	yes, pretty much
3951000	3953000	and how did Endless Ocean do?
3953000	3955000	not very well, how did
3955000	3957000	there was another Safari game that was on the Wii
3957000	3959000	that sucked
3959000	3961000	that's the only Safari game that did any
3961000	3963000	and this is not even really a Safari game
3963000	3965000	but a similar game that did
3965000	3967000	you know, really well was Pokemon Snap
3967000	3969000	I'm going to guess that's because it had Pokemon in it
3969000	3971000	have we ever had like a really kick-ass
3971000	3973000	Safari game, like Jumbo Safari
3973000	3975000	of course, but
3975000	3977000	that's just an arcade game, people like that game
3977000	3979000	eat moves and you're going really fast
3979000	3981000	and you're catching animals
3981000	3983000	and you can throw harpoons
3983000	3985000	harpoons make every game better
3985000	3987000	add that to the list of things
3987000	3989000	that make games better
3989000	3991000	1 Dragonforce, 2 harpoons
3991000	3993000	3 Pokemon
3993000	3995000	who didn't love Scorpion in the first Mortal Kombat
3995000	3997000	Pokemon does not make things better
3997000	3999000	stop that
3999000	4001000	that is wrong
4001000	4003000	Pokemon has flavor
4003000	4007000	eating Pokemon would make a game better
4007000	4009000	number 1 thing that makes games better
4009000	4011000	Dragonforce
4011000	4013000	by the way, they have a new album coming out
4013000	4015000	do what?
4015000	4017000	number 2, things that make games better
4017000	4019000	harpoons
4019000	4021000	3, the other things that make games better
4021000	4023000	fire, shooting hookers
4023000	4025000	we need to get them on the show promoting their album
4025000	4027000	I will send them an email
4027000	4029000	right after the show, I will
4029000	4031000	alright
4031000	4033000	however we have some other business to take care of
4033000	4035000	real quick
4035000	4037000	Tigerclaw says in chat
4037000	4039000	the real question is
4039000	4041000	will Africa show animals doing it?
4041000	4043000	yes!
4043000	4045000	since it's supposed to stimulate
4045000	4047000	stimulate the wildlife
4047000	4049000	well we know where my brain is
4049000	4051000	since it's supposed to simulate
4051000	4053000	wildlife, what do wildlife often do?
4053000	4055000	Frisbee says
4055000	4057000	Africa, rated M for strong sexual content
4057000	4059000	2 things, 1, animals fuck
4059000	4061000	2, monkeys throw poo
4061000	4063000	the end
4063000	4065000	did you see that, someone says
4065000	4067000	and it had the pester ball
4067000	4069000	did you see that
4069000	4071000	there's a little robotic camera
4071000	4073000	that you can drive around
4073000	4075000	and take pictures with
4075000	4077000	in Africa?
4077000	4079000	yeah, it looked like a Mars lander
4079000	4081000	I can't wait to annoy things with that
4081000	4083000	that's it
4083000	4085000	Darktessia's got it
4085000	4087000	instead of doing Africa, they should do
4087000	4089000	Jurassic Park
4089000	4091000	with a cam
4091000	4093000	and you could drop lawyers in there
4093000	4095000	and watch them eat people
4095000	4097000	were you trying to avoid getting eaten by a
4097000	4099000	velociraptor?
4099000	4101000	no, you have a robot camera
4101000	4103000	dude, taking a trip down memory lane
4103000	4105000	for a minute, and we're about to get into the
4105000	4107000	classic game a week, so this is okay
4107000	4109000	I don't know if you remember this game
4109000	4111000	the original Jurassic Park game that was on
4111000	4113000	Super Nintendo, it boasted
4113000	4115000	it was one of the first games that used surround sound
4115000	4117000	and all this stuff, now here's the thing
4117000	4119000	the game was kind of split into two parts
4119000	4121000	there was an overworld thing
4121000	4123000	that was kind of generic, like it was your basic
4123000	4125000	3D
4125000	4127000	ISO type view, where you go
4127000	4129000	around the world collecting things, whatever
4129000	4131000	but then you went into this mode, which was like
4131000	4133000	first person, Doom type thing
4133000	4135000	and I'll tell you what, if you played that game with all the lights
4135000	4137000	out and everything back in the game
4137000	4139000	that mode was scary as hell
4139000	4141000	because you would be walking around
4141000	4143000	and suddenly a velociraptor comes out of nowhere
4143000	4145000	and crawls your eyeballs out and it's over
4145000	4147000	and it was scary
4147000	4149000	did you ever play that game?
4149000	4151000	it was freaky, and then Hitler comes out
4151000	4153000	in the robotic machine
4153000	4155000	but I was at just two lanes one time
4155000	4157000	back when they had an arcade and not a pro shop
4157000	4159000	and they had
4159000	4161000	for some reason their Jurassic Park
4161000	4163000	shooter game was broken
4163000	4165000	and so I got to play on free play
4165000	4167000	the whole time, so I had beaten the arcade one
4167000	4169000	you know what, I'm very disappointed in him
4169000	4171000	this is totally off topic, but that's fine
4171000	4173000	off topic, us, who?
4173000	4175000	this show, off topic?
4175000	4177000	it has to do with games
4177000	4179000	where the hell is the fucking Silent Hill arcade game
4179000	4181000	locally?
4181000	4183000	hey, that's a very good question, what the hell ever happened to that game?
4183000	4185000	no one has imported that shit
4185000	4187000	that is a damn good question
4187000	4189000	let's buy one
4189000	4191000	we could put it in the corner right there, that works
4191000	4193000	I'm down, we could just liquidate the funds
4193000	4195000	Loki will be very happy at this news
4195000	4197000	guess what the OLR studio is getting next week?
4197000	4199000	a couch
4199000	4201000	we are getting a couch, and I'm thinking we're gonna put it right there
4201000	4203000	where Loki usually sits
4203000	4205000	by the way, I'm going to
4205000	4207000	buy us an air conditioner
4207000	4209000	sweet
4209000	4211000	with the funds that were donated to us
4211000	4213000	hooray
4213000	4215000	and we're going to put it in that window
4215000	4217000	and we're not gonna burn our asses off
4217000	4219000	here in the studio
4219000	4221000	it's not that bad
4221000	4223000	not right now, but wait until August, hello
4223000	4225000	well we could get more fans, I don't know, we'll get the damn air conditioner
4225000	4227000	you know what, we need
4227000	4229000	a game called beat the heat
4229000	4231000	where you actually take like, pockets of heat
4231000	4233000	and beat them to death
4233000	4235000	one other quick thing about Jurassic Park, wasn't it weird
4235000	4237000	that the Genesis version of Jurassic Park was like
4237000	4239000	a completely fucking different game
4239000	4241000	it was like, it was more of a side scroller
4241000	4243000	it was better
4243000	4245000	he could play as the velociraptor and kill people
4245000	4247000	true, alright, there you go
4247000	4249000	just about everything was different
4249000	4251000	you know, for games that would come out on one system
4251000	4253000	versus the other
4253000	4255000	look, nostalgia is awesome
4255000	4257000	and all, but we have another segment we do
4257000	4259000	here on Orange Lounge Radio
4259000	4261000	it's a chance for us to
4261000	4263000	it's nostalgic too?
4263000	4265000	it is, very nostalgic, it's a chance for us to pay tribute
4265000	4267000	if you will, to the elders
4267000	4269000	of gaming, what?
4269000	4271000	I had a list of two
4271000	4273000	and thanks to Sauce
4273000	4275000	I had a list of one
4275000	4277000	well you'll just use the other one next week, won't you?
4277000	4279000	I'll probably forget
4279000	4281000	and I had to go in the vault to pick this again too
4281000	4283000	look, look
4283000	4285000	this is the last video game of the week
4285000	4287000	for you kids to dig up and play
4287000	4289000	and Dark Sakura
4289000	4291000	is dug through the archives with Sauce
4291000	4293000	the archives?
4293000	4295000	what is wrong with me tonight? I'm broken, malfunction, malfunction
4295000	4297000	alright, uh
4297000	4299000	exterminate
4299000	4301000	exterminate, what is the classic game
4301000	4303000	the kids should be playing this week?
4303000	4305000	Space Channel 5
4305000	4307000	cheeseball, cheeseball, cheeseball
4307000	4319000	play some music!
4319000	4321000	oh did I miss it?
4321000	4323000	you want me to go back to it?
4323000	4325000	Space Channel 5
4353000	4358220	And this one is obviously from the Japanese version, but her voice actor in America was
4358220	4362300	Apollo Smile, who was supposed to be like the blooming anime girl who's actually kind
4362300	4364300	of a big hoe.
4364300	4369680	But with this one though, it is technically a music slash puzzle game.
4369680	4378640	And so the whole point of this is that you run into these little aliens called Melodians.
4378640	4382140	And it's funny when you have your load screen that says Now Meloding, which I felt was pretty
4382140	4383140	good.
4383140	4388440	Anyway, they'll name out a direction and then maybe a shoot button, and you have to mimic
4388440	4389440	it when it's your turn.
4389440	4393960	And it has to be perfectly in time with the same rhythm that they did.
4393960	4399320	So you have to have a really good sense of rhythm and keep up with it.
4399320	4405120	As you go through, you also have like a little heart blast where you can rescue people.
4405120	4409720	And so as you're going through the game, if you rescue people, they join your little entourage
4409720	4410960	that walks behind you.
4410960	4416800	And like in the last level, you can actually get Space Michael, as in Michael Jackson.
4416800	4421560	There's also a Game Boy Advance one that I didn't play because I refused to.
4421560	4429240	And Rez had a Merolian in it as one of the evolutions for the characters.
4429240	4431200	So that was pretty cool.
4431200	4434240	There's also the Space Channel 5 minigame in Sega Superstars.
4434240	4439720	There's a Sonic, uh, the, the, um, Ulala is a hidden character in Sonic Riders.
4439720	4445920	Um, there's actually a girl who looks like Ulala in Phantasy Star Universe around Chapter
4445920	4446920	10.
4446920	4450960	She's the news reporter for Gerhal Channel 5 News.
4450960	4451960	And it's her theme song.
4451960	4452960	I've seen that.
4452960	4453960	She's in the, she's in the add-ons too.
4453960	4458400	Um, Ulala and Pudding are playable characters in, uh, Sega Superstars Tennis.
4458400	4460760	Pudding is like her rival.
4460760	4463600	Um, Pudding is also one of the best video game characters ever.
4463600	4470960	Um, there's also, um, Space Channel 5 Part 2 and, um, something actually Rob, do you
4470960	4471960	like D-Lite?
4471960	4472960	The group D-Lite?
4472960	4476400	I, I like the one song that everybody knows by D-Lite.
4476400	4478400	Quick name two D-Lite songs.
4478400	4481280	Those grooves in the heart that everyone knows.
4481280	4484480	And I have like, um, their, uh, one of their, uh, their later albums.
4484480	4486040	I thought it was really good.
4486040	4490040	But, um, Lady Miss Keir, who is their, their singer, actually, um, opened a lawsuit against
4490040	4497040	Sega for, uh, basing Ulala off of her without her permission.
4497040	4500400	And, uh, Hippolytus is in chat right now and knows quite a bit about, uh, D-Lite.
4500400	4504480	Apparently they split up years ago and Keir Kirby and DJ Dimitri married.
4504480	4507800	And, uh, Talate was in that group too and he does remixes for like everybody.
4507800	4508800	They were confusing.
4508800	4514200	But, um, anyway, the way that that went is that, um, Sega, um, offered her $16,000 for
4514200	4517640	licensing and to use their songs.
4517640	4521800	And she refused and they went ahead and made the game anyway, but she lost the lawsuit
4521800	4528200	and had to pay, um, Sega's regal worth of, uh, $608,000.
4528200	4534680	So, um, and actually that was Michael Jackson doing his own voice acting in the game, by
4534680	4535680	the way.
4535680	4536680	Because Michael Jackson loves Sega.
4536680	4538840	Didn't he only say, like, two things in the game, though?
4538840	4543520	He said, thank you, Ulala, and- Sega made that frickin' Moonwalker game, which was all
4543520	4544520	kinds of badass.
4544520	4545520	I know.
4545520	4550120	He had a whole big- in Space Channel 5 Part 2, there's a whole part of the game that's
4550120	4552120	doing nothing but buy the Jackson dances.
4552120	4553120	Yeah, it's pretty rad.
4553120	4554120	It's freakin' cool.
4554120	4560560	And I really love Space Channel 5 too, but, um, but this, um, this was, like, the game
4560560	4561560	for me.
4561560	4562560	Space Channel 5.
4562560	4563560	I love this game.
4563560	4565440	Let's get to the, um, boss music, because it's really awesome.
4565440	4568760	This is the other big thing, is the great music in the game.
4568760	4575760	I remember this stage.
4575760	4596760	Gerardo mode, boops, he says, the first level of my favorite song is the same.
4596760	4624600	This is my favorite music in the game, because it's all shit, shit, shit.
4624600	4626440	It gets stuck in your head.
4626440	4627440	So easily.
4627440	4628440	That's the crazy thing about this game.
4628440	4632040	Well, it's better to- it's easier to tell it in the American version, because it's either
4632040	4637360	chew or shoot, or, uh, or heart or something, no, it's- what is the other thing she said
4637360	4642360	if it- she says chew and she shoots them, and it's something else when, you know, when,
4642360	4643360	uh, she saves people.
4643360	4645360	Hey, I think is what they say.
4645360	4649640	But anyway, um, Space Channel 5 too, though, had, like, um, my favorite bad guy in any
4649640	4650640	game ever, though.
4650640	4653360	And that was the three robots that had the speakers coming out of their head that would
4653360	4655360	sing, like, to the, uh, barbershop quartet.
4655360	4656360	I think I remember that.
4656360	4657360	They were awesome.
4657360	4662160	But, um, we need- we need more Space Channel 5, we need more Lala.
4662160	4663960	It'll be awesome.
4663960	4669920	All right, Space Channel 5 is your classic game of the week, available on the Dreamcast,
4669920	4671960	um, also- And PlayStation 2.
4671960	4674000	Repackaged for PlayStation 2, that's right.
4674000	4677400	So check it out on either of those systems- would you say they're both good, or you need
4677400	4678400	to actually check it out?
4678400	4679400	Dreamcast!
4679400	4680400	Yeah, that's what I figured.
4680400	4682080	Actually- You always pick Dreamcast games.
4682080	4683080	Actually, actually, actually, Rob.
4683080	4684080	What?
4684080	4691520	I have to say that I do have, um, Space Channel 5 2 on PlayStation 2, and it was really good.
4691520	4696780	And I have played Space Channel 5 on PlayStation 2, and it was also very good.
4696780	4698120	It was a very good port.
4698120	4699120	All right.
4699120	4700120	Very cool.
4700120	4701120	All right, I have a request.
4701120	4703400	Next week, I'm going to challenge you to pick something not Sega.
4703400	4711000	But- I haven't done Sega- I don't- what was- okay, last week was Sega.
4711000	4713000	The week before that- oh, the week before that was Sega.
4713000	4714000	Yeah, exactly.
4714000	4715000	The week before that.
4715000	4716000	The week before that.
4716000	4717000	Go check the wiki.
4717000	4718000	I'm just giving you a hard time.
4718000	4719000	Pick whatever the hell you want.
4719000	4720000	But- but Sega's awesome.
4720000	4721000	Sega is awesome.
4721000	4722000	I want to hear something creepy.
4722000	4723000	What?
4723000	4724000	And not related to Sega in any way.
4724000	4725000	Okay.
4725000	4726000	They're making another Barbie Horse Adventures game.
4726000	4727000	The fuck?
4727000	4728000	Okay.
4728000	4729000	Chat room.
4729000	4730000	People who update our wiki.
4730000	4736200	I need someone who has, um, elite skills in Excel or Access to, um, uh, put everything
4736200	4741520	into a spreadsheet and see what the percentage of games that I have picked that are Sega.
4741520	4742520	All right.
4742520	4743520	Thank you.
4743520	4744520	Thank you.
4744520	4745520	Thank you.
4745520	4746520	It's in Excel.
4746520	4747520	It's freaking easy.
4747520	4748520	AJ Mix says eight Sega games.
4748520	4749520	Okay.
4749520	4750520	Overall.
4750520	4751520	I guess.
4751520	4752520	That's not that bad.
4752520	4753520	That's not that bad.
4753520	4754520	All right.
4754520	4755520	Look, I'm just giving her a hard time.
4755520	4756520	That's what I do here on the program.
4756520	4757520	That's what they pay me to do.
4757520	4758520	But I have to give a hard time back by having no sense of humor.
4758520	4759520	All right.
4759520	4760520	Rob?
4760520	4761520	What?
