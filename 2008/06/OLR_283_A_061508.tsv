0	18640	Today, June 15th, 2008, does Nintendo think you are a geek?
18640	20720	How can you get your picture in Street Fighter 4?
20720	29760	And many new role-playing games get dated for the Xbox 360.
29760	35480	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35480	36480	Radio.
36480	40640	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
40640	41800	and the gamer lifestyle.
41800	43520	My name is Rob Roberts.
43520	47480	Joining us a little late tonight is the one and only dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47480	51240	She's not here yet, but she's en route, so we'll connect with her when she gets here
51240	52320	to studio.
52320	55360	But already here and ready to go, the one and only tech master, Loki.
55360	56360	Hello.
56360	57360	How you doing, Loki?
57360	58360	I'm doing fine.
58360	59360	All right.
59360	60760	Gosh, I guess there's not a lot to say.
60760	62560	We don't have a lot of special guests tonight.
62560	63920	It's kind of a slow night.
63920	67840	It was kind of a slow news week up until about two hours ago, which we'll get into in a little
67840	68840	bit.
68840	73440	And we're just kind of sitting here waiting for next week, our sixth anniversary show.
73440	75040	We've had some changes in studio.
75040	77040	I don't know if you can see it on Justin TV.
77040	81680	A lot of people are bitching on Justin TV because it's kind of blurry tonight because
81680	85360	we just don't have the bandwidth right now to put out a really clear image and the way
85360	91680	we have things hooked up as a crappy revolution, not revolution, yeah, JTV revolution, TV,
91680	92680	TV revolution.
92680	97200	I don't know, but it looks like complete crap, but hopefully you can make out that Loki finally
97200	98920	has a real chair.
98920	102280	It's this nice blue little fluffy chair thing going on.
102280	104120	It's the chair that Jamie used to have.
104120	105520	She has a couch now.
105520	108360	Yes, because now there is a couch over there.
108360	110920	Maybe I can show the people on Justin TV about the couch.
110920	111920	I don't know.
111920	116440	Maybe if you untangle yourself from the chair there.
116440	117440	There.
117440	118440	Can they see that?
118440	119640	Yeah, they can see that.
119640	120640	It's a couch.
120640	122760	That's the couch.
122760	125660	Now I have to fix the camera, so we better start off tonight's show with a little bit
125660	128200	of how was your gaming week, Loki?
128200	130320	I didn't play a whole lot this week.
130320	133280	I meant to, but I just got distracted.
133280	139440	I'm 100% complete now with Grand Theft Auto IV, so I've got the achievement and all that
139440	140440	fun stuff.
140440	148080	Now, I finally got my video set up at home working, so I'm recording video now of game
148080	149080	playing.
149080	151960	I can do direct feed stuff now, which is cool.
151960	156200	I tried all these different ways to get my video capture thing to work right, and really
156200	160020	the only thing that ended up is I needed to bring back my TV, which you may remember was
160020	164840	in the old arcade cabinet, back from work and put it into the computer room.
164840	170320	So now I have a TV sitting on the floor there that I play video on, and it has a video out
170320	177940	on the TV, and that goes straight to the capture card, and it looks pretty, and it works awesome.
177940	184920	So what I've been doing, because I got bored on Friday and I was watching some GameTrailers.com
184920	189640	videos from Grand Theft Auto IV, and some of the glitch stuff that's in there, and one
189640	193920	of the new glitches that someone found is the evil swing set, and what the evil swing
193920	199760	set does is if you drive your car up to that evil swing set and leave it there for a second,
199760	205240	it will fling you way into the air, and it's hilarious.
205240	209360	So I was playing around with that most of the weekend, and recording video, and now
209360	215620	I've edited it down, and I'm trying to put something together coherent with it, and hopefully
215620	217960	we'll see a lot more of these things.
217960	221400	So we might actually have something on our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel.
221400	222400	Yes.
222400	223980	Because we haven't had anything on there in like two years.
223980	227800	I think the last thing that's on there is when you and Jamie were interviewed by the
227800	230580	news station about Guitar Hero 1.
230580	231580	That's pretty old.
231580	233100	That's the last thing that's on there.
233100	234920	So good, I'm glad to hear we have some updates.
234920	235920	That's awesome.
235920	240400	And I got a video camera too, so I'm hoping I can do some stuff as well, especially with
240400	243760	Penny Arcade Expo around the corner, which I still need to book my flight for, I've been
243760	245880	a very bad boy, but I do plan on going.
245880	246880	So it'll be fun.
246880	248760	And Blizzcon, Blizzcon's definite as well.
248760	255700	I did pick up Blastworks this week, and I actually meant to do stuff with it, but Nelly
255700	258460	was playing Speed Racer a lot this week.
258460	260960	She really has found a game she loves, huh?
260960	265320	No, she's already bored of it, because she's gotten to a part now where it's so hard that
265320	272320	she can't go any further, so she's like kind of given up on it and going back to reading.
272320	277160	But no, I actually have Blastworks, and I meant to do some really cool stuff with it,
277160	280840	but I haven't quite gotten everything that I need.
280840	282720	My setup and everything's all ready to go.
282720	287120	I just need to, I don't know, actually sit down and do it.
287120	292240	Basically, I want to put the Star Fox ships in Blastworks, because it makes sense.
292240	296320	Star Fox, very simple looking, and you could probably recreate it pretty simple.
296320	300180	So I'll make some levels out of that, that'd be fun.
300180	305020	But yeah, we already have a thread going on our forums, and people are exchanging stuff.
305020	308160	There's been some pretty cool stuff already made, like an OLR sign, and the...
308160	309160	I haven't seen that.
309160	314160	I saw the Phoenix Wright one, not Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, I saw the Apollo Justice
314160	315160	thing.
315160	316160	Yeah, you gotta check it out.
316160	324040	They have an OLR sign, and there is some other stuff on there too, that's pretty funny.
324040	325640	So definitely worth checking out.
325640	330480	Yeah, if you want to see that, just head on to our very archaic website at orangeloungeradio.com.
330480	334440	We were gonna get a new website, we really need to look into that.
334440	340800	And go to our forums, and you're gonna click on the OLR me clans, and you go to the Blastworks
340800	348520	custom data thread, and let's see, there's the Apollo Justice, oh look at that, that's
348520	349520	cute.
349520	352800	The OLR billboard made by GS68, that's pretty rad.
352800	354360	And then some more ships there that he made.
354360	355800	I like that.
355800	356800	That's cool.
356800	360840	Yeah, that's one thing I think this game's gonna catch a lot of people by surprise, because
360840	364000	there's so much you can make with it, and there's that online community where you can
364000	366360	share stuff, download other things.
366360	370160	So once you get done playing the game and unlocking the four other games in it, I mean
370160	375680	you can practically play all new games, you know, forever.
375680	377320	So it's pretty awesome.
377320	379320	Wow, sounds pretty good.
379320	383600	Alright, well as far as my gaming week goes, let me see, what kind of stuff have I been
383600	385600	playing in my gaming week?
385600	389360	Not a whole lot, because you know, there was World of Warcraft, and we went through all
389360	393080	of Karazhan in one night, because you know, we're addicted, and Irene called me, and she
393080	395160	was like, Rob, Karazhan.
395160	396160	So there was that.
396160	397160	But I have been playing other games.
397160	400640	I checked out the demo for Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.
400640	403760	This is a game I've been pretty excited about, because if you've listened to this show before,
403760	408160	you know I love old school Civilization, like the very first one that was on the PCs back
408160	409400	in the early 90s.
409400	413400	I love this game to bits, even as much as most console games.
413400	417540	I mean, it's probably my favorite PC game of all time, certainly.
417540	421720	So I wanted to see how it translated to console, and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed.
421720	427840	I think they took out a lot of micromanaging that made Civilization really complicated.
427840	432840	I mean, not to say it's bad, because playing Civilization Revolution, I also went back
432840	438000	to go play Civilization 4, which I had skipped, because I wasn't all that big on Civilization
438000	439000	3.
439000	440720	I was like, ah, nothing's ever gonna live up to the original.
440720	444960	I actually really enjoyed Civilization 4, even though there's more of that micromanaging,
444960	448860	and you actually have to kind of manage your settlers and all that going on there.
448860	453060	But in Civilization Revolution, they've really kind of, I think, I guess streamlined a lot
453060	459040	of it to make it more accessible to a newbie, and made it just feel more like a casual gaming
459040	460040	experience.
460040	464080	I guess maybe that's what it is, it's more, but I feel weird calling Civilization a casual
464080	465080	game, because it's really not.
465080	469520	But they made it, I guess, a little easier, but I don't want to say they dumbed it down,
469520	471720	because Civilization is a very smart game.
471720	472720	You know what I mean?
472720	480920	I was gonna say that I'm not really looking forward to Civilization, but Red Alert 3 is
480920	484360	gonna be coming out later this year, and that might be something I have to look at.
484360	486120	Is that something that's coming out on consoles?
486120	489960	Yes, on the Xbox 360, and I think PC.
489960	493640	So it'll be pretty awesome.
493640	494640	Huge Red Alert fan, though.
494640	499620	I don't know, though, I'm more of the PC Red Alert, because I like cheating my ass off
499620	504680	in that game, especially playing with the rules.ini files and stuff like that, and adding
504680	508520	the school bus of death, and fun stuff like that.
508520	509520	Hmm.
509520	510520	Alright.
510520	514600	Let's see, other games I played this week, well I guess it was just the Civilization
514600	520080	4, and then for some reason I had a night of Atari 2600 gaming, thanks to GameTap.
520080	525920	I went back and played Kaboom, and went back and played Freeway, and all these crazy 2600
525920	529080	games that I remember from the past.
529080	531120	It was all good.
531120	532120	And that was really it.
532120	533120	Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
533120	536040	I don't even remember what came out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
536040	537520	Was this Commando this week?
537520	538520	I think it was Commando.
538520	542120	I think I wanted to check that out, but I just never got around to that.
542120	543120	Alright.
543120	546800	Alright, so Dark Sakura is settling in, she just got here.
546800	547800	I hate people.
547800	550520	Sorry, I hate people, too.
550520	553700	I hate people to get in my way.
553700	555040	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
555040	556400	Did you have a good gaming week?
556400	564840	We bought Crystal Castles for the Atari 2600 today, and Dragon's something that's the Genesis
564840	566480	equivalent of Devil's Crush.
566480	570160	Oh, I don't even know this game.
570160	572240	I forgot the name, I'm kind of...
572240	575880	I'm sure a chatter will think of it, chat.orangetonstrategy.com if you want to join in the fun.
575880	579780	And I finally found the one movie I've been looking for that, you know, I've been finding
579780	584960	it expensive, even used, and I was pissed off, but I finally, finally found it for ten
584960	585960	bucks.
585960	586960	Yeah.
586960	587960	Hypercube.
587960	588960	Oh, okay.
588960	589960	That's like Cube 3, right?
589960	590960	Cube 2.
590960	591960	Huh.
591960	594920	If you haven't seen it, you can come over and watch it with me, because it's the awesome
594920	595920	one.
595920	598440	I haven't seen Cube 2 or Cube 3, I've seen the original Cube.
598440	600640	Cube would be a pretty badass video game, wouldn't it?
600640	603760	I have to tell you, someone has made a Hypercube mod for Half-Life.
603760	604760	Uh-huh.
604760	605760	Interesting.
605760	613160	I like Hypercube just because it has to do with weird physics.
613160	618200	You know, stuff that Carl Sagan talked about.
618200	622440	Gameguru in our chat at chat.orangetonstrategy.com says, Keystone Capers for the win.
622440	624760	There's a lot of Atari 2600 left tonight.
624760	627160	What possessed you to go get Crystal Castles for the 2600?
627160	632920	We were at Dimple and it was there, and so we bought it.
632920	634460	Well, alrighty.
634460	637120	And I almost bought Season 5 of Bullshit.
637120	639080	How far can you get in Crystal Castles?
639080	644520	Like, I can only get to like the second set of boards, and like, I guess there's like
644520	649040	10 sets of boards, and I'm like, oh my god, this game is massive, and I really suck at
649040	650040	it.
650040	657120	Well, the best Crystal Castles player in the world, if you watch the King of Kong video,
657120	658120	he's in it.
658120	660580	At least he was the last one who got the record on it.
660580	662640	He plays it with his feet.
662640	663960	Wow.
663960	665680	Like with the trackball, with his feet?
665680	670080	The arcade is sitting in a chair, using his feet.
670080	671080	That's pretty rad.
671080	677760	I have to say that is pretty, pretty amazing on a stupid computer.
677760	681760	So we're always on the cutting edge of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio, playing Atari
681760	682760	2600 games this week.
682760	685920	I've had plenty of edges of stuff.
685920	687480	Usually paper cuts on the manuals.
687480	694280	Oh yeah, we also had a good bit of Metal Gear Solid 4 being beaten twice over in my house.
694280	696520	That's what the other one was, Frogger 2.
696520	698360	Oh god.
698360	699760	I think probably better left forgotten.
699760	700760	I don't know.
700760	701760	I don't know.
701760	702760	The Frogger games weren't all bad.
702760	703760	But I want to hear about, the hell with Frogger.
703760	706560	I want to hear about Metal Gear Solid 4, because I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner.
706560	711360	I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf live, because you know, he's on live before us over at AllGames.com,
711360	715400	and one of his callers called in to just rave about the game.
715400	717760	Dark Soccer, I know you've been a Solid Snake fan for a while.
717760	718760	What do you think?
718760	719880	It was pretty epic.
719880	720880	Pretty epic.
720880	722400	And Dan hurt his fingers playing.
722400	724520	He actually got a cramp in his middle finger.
724520	725520	Wow.
725520	728800	I was like, my man, hardcore gamer.
728800	730680	And I'm sure he's showing it off to everybody.
730680	731680	Look what I hurt.
731680	732680	Look what I hurt.
732680	733680	No.
733680	735680	He's been talking about it though.
735680	739880	I have to say though, it's got like the longest fucking ending in the universe.
739880	743440	And it's also the biggest WTF ending in the universe, which I'm not going to say more
743440	744440	than that.
744440	745440	Right.
745440	746440	But it has plenty of my man in it.
746440	747440	Solid Snake?
747440	748440	Because I'm like the only one that likes Raiden.
748440	749900	Oh, Raiden.
749900	754200	And on top of that, it's a lot of Raiden kicking ass until he doesn't kick ass.
754200	758960	And that's not all I'm going to say about that.
758960	766960	But I have to say that I'm overall pleased with the project and give Kojima and team
766960	771040	mad props for doing a good job.
771040	774820	I don't know if you can say this without spoiling, so you can say I can't answer.
774820	778660	But does it leave the door open to Metal Gear Solid 5?
778660	779660	Actually yes.
779660	780660	Okay.
780660	781660	And I'm not going to-
781660	782660	Is there a dog ending?
782660	783660	That's Silent Hill, dummy.
783660	784660	It doesn't matter.
784660	785660	They can branch out.
785660	786660	All right.
786660	794720	But I do have to say that I was sitting in my little hole in the house being the computer
794720	795720	room.
795720	796720	You know where I'm talking about.
796720	797720	Right.
797720	798720	Yeah.
798720	799720	And all of a sudden I hear the Snake Eater theme.
799720	802160	And I'm like, what?
802160	810840	And I just have to say that for fans of the older series, there's major, major nods to
810840	813340	the old Metal Gear series.
813340	819720	And I'm not going to tell you what they are, but it's really, really-
819720	820720	Fucking epic.
820720	821720	And-
821720	823820	The way that they do it is really cool.
823820	829480	And I can't support this game in any way also, by the way, because Solid Snake in the game
829480	832440	uses an Apple iPod.
832440	833440	Oh shut up.
833440	834440	I don't think he-
834440	836800	No, there is an Apple iPod in there.
836800	837800	Just shut up.
837800	838800	What wonderful product placement.
838800	841880	I don't remember seeing any of that going on in the game, because they were too busy
841880	846320	shooting stuff and talking about love on the battlefield.
846320	847320	Love on the-
847320	848320	Love is a battlefield.
848320	849320	Yeah.
849320	854020	No, it's like this constant spiritual metaphor for-
854020	856880	Do you know what would make Metal Gear Solid 4 better?
856880	857880	Snake not being old.
857880	860560	It's a musical.
860560	861560	Okay the whole-
861560	864120	You know what my subtitle for this game has been?
864120	865120	What?
865120	868680	It's Metal Gear Solid 4, damn Snake, you got old.
868680	869680	That's it.
869680	873760	That and WTF towards one of the female characters.
873760	874760	Alright.
874760	875760	I gotta say some comments from chat.
875760	878240	Ossifer says, I got MGS4 and it's pretty kick ass.
878240	882400	It's the first game I've ever played in the series, but damn, one word describes it.
882400	883400	Epic.
883400	884400	So you know what I'm talking about, right?
884400	889040	One word goes, well, you haven't played the older ones, but you've got an idea now.
889040	890040	That's all I'm gonna say.
890040	893880	Careful with putting that mic there, because the fan- Our studio has been rearranged.
893880	895400	I was telling the listeners earlier.
895400	896940	Now Jamie gets her own couch.
896940	901120	I'm waiting for her to kick her feet up one night and just- It doesn't work there either.
901120	902560	You gotta put it next to you or something.
902560	903560	Where's the ferret?
903560	904560	Where's my baby?
904560	905560	Where's your ferret?
905560	908920	It's in- Your ferret is used in our D&D game, so it's in the house.
908920	912520	You're playing D&D and not tell me?
912520	913520	You wanna come play?
913520	914520	Sure, I can invite you.
914520	915520	Yeah?
915520	916520	We're like level four.
916520	917520	Oh god.
917520	918520	What?
918520	919520	Oh god.
919520	920520	I just like- I gained like- I have a level six wereweasel.
920520	923320	50,000 nerd points with our listeners, like I'm the uber nerd now.
923320	925040	I have a level six wereweasel.
925040	926040	I'm a bard.
926040	927040	I'm a level four bard.
927040	928040	Spoonie bard?
928040	930440	Not quite a- I'm a sassy bard, not a spoonie bard.
930440	932880	My wereweasel has tasted of human before.
932880	936600	But you're- The ferret, because somebody has a ferret familiar in the game, so we actually
936600	938400	use the ferret as the ferret.
938400	942000	Do you remember- You remember Mel and Eric from the DDR days, right?
942000	943000	Yes.
943000	944320	That's what I need to deal with.
944320	945880	The ferret is Mel's companion.
945880	948280	Well, I will talk to peeps.
948280	950360	Well, if it's on Tuesday, I can't do it.
950360	951360	It's not Tuesday.
951360	952360	It's like weekends, usually.
952360	953360	Okay.
953360	954360	All right.
954360	955360	Cool.
955360	956360	All right.
956360	957360	Yeah.
957360	958360	Valerno in chat is asking who's breathing into their mic-
958360	961680	This is the fan thing, and I'm not gonna do anything about it, so shut up.
961680	962680	It's the fan.
962680	966480	All she has to do is put her mic down, like not on the arm, but on the- Yeah, just leave
966480	967480	it in your cleavage.
967480	968480	It'll be fine.
968480	971440	Or put it- Just put it below the arm so the fan's not blowing on it.
971440	972440	All right.
972440	978360	My face is above the arm line, so I need like a shield over the mic.
978360	979360	All right.
979360	980360	Forget it.
980360	983400	Xenocore says, Sky, you better be playing version four or you're lame.
983400	985920	We started playing before four was out, because four just came out.
985920	986920	You know what?
986920	993760	Fuck everybody, because it's all about version two.
993760	994760	Oh.
994760	995760	Two and 2.5.
995760	996760	Why you gotta bring THAC0 into this?
996760	997760	Hell yeah.
997760	999840	I can still calculate THAC0.
999840	1003560	All right, look.
1003560	1005280	We've really gotta get back to video games.
1005280	1008760	I want to say another quick thing about Metal Gear Solid 4.
1008760	1010840	I just noticed this on Digg earlier today.
1010840	1014880	Apparently GameSpot has given Metal Gear Solid 4 a 10 out of 10.
1014880	1017400	It's only the sixth game in history to do so.
1017400	1021040	Do you think this is a game that's deserving of all the praise- What if I need to give
1021040	1022040	it?
1022040	1023040	Ah, 40.
1023040	1024880	So- Do you think it's deserving- I trust- I trust
1024880	1030000	fund me to over GameStop- Well, they also gave Nintendogs a 40 if I remember
1030000	1031800	right, so I'm a little- But Nintendogs was great.
1031800	1032800	For five minutes.
1032800	1034800	But more like five days.
1034800	1035800	All right, I'll give you that.
1035800	1036800	Actually more like five weeks.
1036800	1037800	Five days.
1037800	1040800	Because about five weeks is when I started getting tired of it, and I guarantee you a
1040800	1044520	month from now people are going to be Metal Gear what?
1044520	1049720	Because people have that kind of attention span that would be none.
1049720	1056800	Xenocore in chat says fuck Thacko, and Kekoman2Dx says they apparently took bards out of four.
1056800	1058560	Do fuck fourth edition if that's the case.
1058560	1060280	Dude, it's- Fuck it right and it's here.
1060280	1064080	It's all about second edition and playing a freaking, uh, uh, Bladesinger.
1064080	1065080	All right.
1065080	1066640	It's all about it.
1066640	1067640	Enough D&D chat.
1067640	1070920	It's all about custom spells and the flesh to toast spell.
1070920	1071920	No!
1071920	1074760	No, the best spell ever, and I have to tell everybody about this.
1074760	1075760	My friend- Oh god.
1075760	1078600	My friend Derek, by the way, congrag- I know you're not listening, but congratulations for
1078600	1085800	getting married, um, last week, um, he, um, had a character named Blackstar who created
1085800	1088580	a spell called Blackstar's Instant Chaos.
1088580	1093560	And so far, I think we got to about five pages, but it was supposed to be ten pages of a hundred
1093560	1096960	effects so the spell would have a thousand effects, random.
1096960	1098880	We've had Jesus in our game before.
1098880	1100800	We've had golf umbrellas pop up.
1100800	1106400	We have had, um, a Mortal Kombat machine land on a lich.
1106400	1108580	All sorts of funny things happen in this game.
1108580	1113160	And also, um, one of my characters actually had a breast enlargement by accident because
1113160	1114160	of the spell.
1114160	1115160	Can we talk video games now?
1115160	1116640	I just thought I'd share that.
1116640	1117640	All right.
1117640	1119200	The best spell ever.
1119200	1122880	I do like that and I fully endorse that in any, you know, upcoming RPG.
1122880	1125320	Oh my god, SSJ100Matt hit the nail on the head.
1125320	1128360	We substituted food talk tonight with D&D talk.
1128360	1130360	At least we're- These french fries suck, by the way.
1130360	1131880	At least we're getting part way there.
1131880	1134480	At least we're talking about games of some sort tonight.
1134480	1137680	I had tiramisu ice cream today.
1137680	1138680	All right.
1138680	1139680	Look.
1139680	1140680	And it was great!
1140680	1145440	We're going to get to talking about video games, but first, some housekeeping news.
1145440	1149160	A very happy Father's Day to all our gamer daddies who are out there listening.
1149160	1153200	It is June 15th of 2008 as we're taping this live.
1153200	1154200	It is Father's Day.
1154200	1158240	So, uh, to all of our gamer dads who happen to be listening to the show, happy Father's
1158240	1159560	Day.
1159560	1163840	All games dot com was hack sword earlier this week, which kind of sucks.
1163840	1168680	I don't know why people keep hacking all games dot com because they are only doing good for
1168680	1173880	the gaming community, but I guess some people want to hack it just because they can and
1173880	1175560	like the challenge.
1175560	1179360	So folks are having to listen to us tonight through- directly through all games radio
1179360	1180360	dot com.
1180360	1184940	From what I hear though, all games dot com is completely being redesigned and there's
1184940	1188520	going to be a complete new site in its place soon.
1188520	1191560	And I wish someone would do the same for OrangeLaunchRadio dot com because damn our old site's getting
1191560	1192560	old.
1192560	1201960	So, um, next week on the show, episode number 284 is the sixth anniversary of OrangeLaunchRadio
1201960	1203120	if you can believe it.
1203120	1207840	A day early for all practical sake, but it's the closest day that falls to our anniversary.
1207840	1214080	The very first episode of OrangeLaunchRadio is June 23rd, 2002, where such topics included
1214080	1217680	us talking about keyboard mania at our local Roseville Golf Land.
1217680	1221560	And we've come a long, long way in six years and we're going to be talking a lot about
1221560	1222600	that next week.
1222600	1224320	Although I did put the word out there.
1224320	1228240	I asked the listeners, what do you want to see for the sixth anniversary of OrangeLaunchRadio?
1228240	1230400	I'm very disappointed in the lack of feedback.
1230400	1233600	There were like a couple people that made suggestions and when I say a couple, I literally
1233600	1234880	mean like two.
1234880	1241360	So make a suggestion now.
1241360	1244840	I will be very, very disappointed with you.
1244840	1245840	Where can they send suggestions?
1245840	1246840	In chat?
1246840	1247840	Mailbag.
1247840	1248840	All right.
1248840	1249840	It's a mailbag.
1249840	1250840	It's a mailbag.
1250840	1251840	In chat.
1251840	1252840	I can't guarantee.
1252840	1253840	I'll read it, but you can do it and we'll see what happens.
1253840	1254840	All right.
1254840	1257600	Cause right now we're just going to do the same old shit we've been doing for the past
1257600	1258600	six years.
1258600	1264880	Make a goddamn suggestion before I go into your dreams and stab you in your imaginations.
1264880	1266440	Have you had a bad day, DarkSakura?
1266440	1267440	Yes.
1267440	1268440	All right.
1268440	1270440	I had to go back for my fucking laptop.
1270440	1273480	All right.
1273480	1274480	Let's see.
1274480	1276320	Rama says, let Travis roast the host.
1276320	1277520	I don't know about that idea.
1277520	1279800	I don't know if I could take that.
1279800	1282520	If he hasn't enough outside the show.
1282520	1285280	Misty says, but I no has any ideas.
1285280	1286280	Cry.
1286280	1287280	Make one.
1287280	1292320	All right, look, we've got a lot of gaming news to get to tonight.
1292320	1295160	We have late breaking news.
1295160	1299320	For all practical purposes, this was a slow news week up until about two, three hours
1299320	1303520	ago when I think the roof just got blown off of something.
1303520	1304960	Now, granted, these are rumors.
1304960	1306200	Loki, what the hell is going on?
1306200	1307200	Update us on the latest.
1307200	1310120	This isn't even on our list of tonight's stories, but this is huge.
1310120	1311120	This isn't even.
1311120	1312120	I wouldn't say this is rumors.
1312120	1317240	I would say it's a little bit above rumors since this is actually coming from a survey
1317240	1324560	site called Intellis, I guess, Intellisponse.com.
1324560	1331640	Apparently my guess is someone got some sort of survey based on one of these news items
1331640	1335560	and then figured out, hey, look, I can go back in the directories here a little bit.
1335560	1339040	Oh, look at all this other stuff.
1339040	1343640	There's everything from mainly Activision and Microsoft stuff.
1343640	1352920	The big juicy stuff, of course, number one being avatars coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.
1352920	1355800	They actually have a picture of some avatars, including someone that looks like they're
1355800	1360060	dressed up like Winnie the Pooh, which is kind of weird.
1360060	1366320	It says avatars are digital personas available this holiday for all Xbox Live connected members
1366320	1370200	and the spring for all new console owners.
1370200	1375340	Avatars will be used in place of the gamer picture you have today and give you a much
1375340	1382560	more lifelike animated, fully customizable persona for you to reflect who you are online.
1382560	1384560	Oh, we're getting Miis.
1384560	1385560	Pretty much.
1385560	1389160	I would say these are a step up from Miis, but essentially, yeah.
1389160	1390880	Their Miis second mix.
1390880	1393160	That's what it is.
1393160	1394640	Miis club mix.
1394640	1396600	Yes, exactly.
1396600	1399920	OK, so let's see here.
1399920	1403080	There's also information about Guitar Hero 4.
1403080	1407800	The instrument bundles are supposed to cost one hundred seventy nine dollars with, you
1407800	1414160	know, the same kind of stuff you get in like rock band, drum set, guitar, microphone and
1414160	1415160	the game.
1415160	1418160	It's supposed to be one hundred seventy nine dollars.
1418160	1420040	I'd say that's about right.
1420040	1423360	And some new information about the Guitar Hero 4 guitar.
1423360	1429400	It will be upgraded and will feature new touch sensitive neck, which will allow you to do
1429400	1434300	neck slides and opens up the entire guitar neck for unbound solos.
1434300	1436400	Shred how you want.
1436400	1439160	And then some of the artists that they mentioned for Guitar Hero 4.
1439160	1444680	Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne,
1444680	1448240	Interpol, Muse and dozens more.
1448240	1454960	And let's see here also, there is some information about remember a while ago, Lips appeared
1454960	1458760	on a press site for some Microsoft announcement.
1458760	1459760	I do.
1459760	1460760	Yes.
1460760	1466160	Well, Lips is a music and singing game that's going to include 30 songs and two wireless
1466160	1471740	interactive microphones, the ability to use and sing your own music or download songs
1471740	1473460	from an online service.
1473460	1475760	It's designed to have fun with your friends.
1475760	1479560	Lips scores you on your singing, pitch, rhythm and tune and overall performance.
1479560	1484440	The wireless mics are interactive with lights on the shaft of the microphone that pulse
1484440	1489600	with the rhythm of your voice and motion sensors that allow you to dance and move or swing
1489600	1491840	to score points.
1491840	1496620	And then you can take songs from your CD or iPod and upload them into the game.
1496620	1502320	I'm sure they also mean to say Zune as well since this is an Xbox 360.
1502320	1507920	And the game will reduce the vocals down so that you can sing along and be heard and score
1507920	1510020	on whether you're in tune or not.
1510020	1515600	And lyrics can be added directly into the song to sing aloud.
1515600	1521640	There is a new Tony Hawk game that's going to be using a motion sensing board controller
1521640	1524320	on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1524320	1528200	In fact, I'm going to try to find this here real quick.
1528200	1529760	This is from a screenshot.
1529760	1533280	This is from chat while you're looking for that, Game Guru said, tomorrow's news and
1533280	1536360	tell a response out of business.
1536360	1538800	I don't know, but people are going to be pissed.
1538800	1543360	I mean, with all these like news stories coming out, did E3 just get ruined?
1543360	1547960	A lot of their big, I think big splashes may have gotten ruined a little bit.
1547960	1548960	With this whole app.
1548960	1553560	So we have Microsoft, OK, they've taken the Miis and made it a little better with the
1553560	1555600	whole avatars thing.
1555600	1559320	They've taken the whole karaoke revolution SingStar thing and made it a little better
1559320	1562920	with this lip sing and this whole like that you can put in any song, you get the vocals
1562920	1563920	taken out.
1563920	1567080	That's like a big freaking deal, although it probably won't work perfectly.
1567080	1569600	That's still kind of a neat feature that the other games don't have.
1569600	1571160	I mean, this is interesting.
1571160	1572360	Oh my God.
1572360	1578400	And this just in, I just saw this and tell a response has also apparently found the theme
1578400	1582160	song from Microsoft's press conference for E3 this year.
1582160	1583160	This is amazing.
1583160	1598280	We have a clip.
1598280	1599280	All right.
1599280	1604880	Anyways, the Tony Hawk game, I guess is the current name right now is Tony Hawk's Adrenaline.
1604880	1610300	It's going to feature a new motion sensing board controller that takes your game off
1610300	1613960	the couch and launches you into the ultimate skateboarding experience.
1613960	1618000	Thanks to an intuitive board based control scheme, it's never been easier to pull off
1618000	1621520	amazing tricks and feel the sensation of skateboarding.
1621520	1626480	Shift your weight to turn and balance grinds, kick back on the tail of the board to ollie
1626480	1628880	and lean into errors and pull off huge spins.
1628880	1632520	Feel the sensation of dropping the 60 foot mega ramp bombing down the world's steepest
1632520	1638520	streets and watching earth disappear behind your board as you launch out of a half pipe.
1638520	1643920	Question, graphics amplify the fun as you ride thrilling situations like these, put
1643920	1648000	down the controller step on the board and feel the sensation of going big.
1648000	1651400	And they say it's going to be 59.99 for the PS3 and Xbox 360.
1651400	1655560	I'm guessing if it's going to come with a board, it's not going to be that price.
1655560	1659640	Anyways, let's see here.
1659640	1662280	What else we got here?
1662280	1663280	This is interesting.
1663280	1665040	I'm not sure what the hell this is though.
1665040	1669760	It's something called Trioxide and it says, introducing the ability to play the latest
1669760	1674400	console games, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii on your PC.
1674400	1681280	Many of these games are only available on consoles today and with this new feature,
1681280	1684760	they will now be available on the PC as well.
1684760	1688400	This is with this feature, those console games are now playable on your PC.
1688400	1693120	Use the same game controllers as the original console systems.
1693120	1696800	All games use regular console controllers, not your computer, keyboard, or mouse.
1696800	1701720	Now see, I read an interesting theory on that whole thread that was going on on NeoGAF where
1701720	1706440	this whole thing exploded, that Trioxide was a possible codename for Xbox 360 because they
1706440	1710960	saw some prices in here, 49 and 299, and people were speculating that maybe 49 is the new
1710960	1716720	price of the controllers and 299 is this new system skew that a lot of folks are speculating
1716720	1720680	Microsoft's going to drop on us at E3 because I guess it's not uncommon for Xbox to use
1720680	1725520	names of like, chemicals, because I think helium was a codename of theirs once.
1725520	1734360	Well, Trioxide, let's see, that would be, um, Ozone, yeah, O3, no, maybe, okay, I think
1734360	1740200	this is why, I think this is why we're in this territory of, it's rumors, but slightly
1740200	1744340	above it, you know, like there's got to be some fact to this, I mean, this company is
1744340	1750080	legit, there's a lot of smoke coming from this, right, but there's, there's probably
1750080	1755560	some red herrings amongst this because what these people did is they were basically sending
1755560	1759400	out surveys, marketing research, and that's how this whole thing got blown, is that if
1759400	1765120	you go to one of those websites, ran this whole Avatars thing because it was, somebody
1765120	1769720	sent it to them confidentially from this website that they were being asked about this whole
1769720	1775300	Avatars thing on a research, well then that link got taken and some people blew it wide
1775300	1778200	open and found all the other surveys that were out there too, that's how this whole
1778200	1779200	thing started.
1779200	1784560	I mean, there's some legitimacy to this underneath, but there's still a lot being drafted to it.
1784560	1786320	Okay, let's see what else we've got here.
1786320	1787800	Um...
1787800	1792680	Scenic Pop Culture Edition makes perfect sense since they've already come out with a scenic game there.
1792680	1795920	The groundwork's already there, so I can see that happening.
1795920	1799720	Extreme Makeover Home Edition for the Wii and DS.
1799720	1800960	Uh, I can see that too.
1800960	1802840	Gossip Girl for the Wii and DS.
1802840	1804760	What?
1804760	1807720	Ultimate Band for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.
1807720	1812160	That, if I remember correctly, Ultimate Band, I know for the Wii, is a Buena Vista game.
1812160	1815320	That's, um, or Disney Interactive, yes.
1815320	1819880	And that, it is a band game that does not use instruments, and that's something that's already been announced.
1819880	1821800	You can play Hannah Montana songs to your heart's content.
1821800	1823400	I guess, yeah.
1823400	1828640	Uh, Wii Yoga, which I guess is supposed to follow along an inspirational yoga guru, instructor,
1828640	1830840	machine, all these on-screen poses, stretches.
1830840	1832320	Wasn't there yoga in Wii Fit?
1832320	1834080	Well, this is something else, okay?
1834080	1837520	So, someone else, I mean, there's a lot of yoga games out there, trust me.
1837520	1840880	Um, I've seen them, I have to sell them, it sucks.
1840880	1843280	They have some stuff on Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
1843280	1847760	Um, a bunch of, you know, because this is a lot of Activision stuff on here, um, in
1847760	1853240	this new Marvel Ultimate Alliance action role-playing game, civil war erupts, and the world's greatest
1853240	1855680	heroes and villains must choose sides.
1855680	1860480	Select your side in the conflict and assemble your team of a roster of 20 Marvel Legends,
1860480	1864960	including Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, and the Human Torch.
1864960	1870480	Combine your team's power and the blah blah blah, it says, um, you can also fuse different
1870480	1876600	powers between characters, such as fusing Spider-Man's powers with Storm to give Spider-Man
1876600	1879200	lightning webs, so that's kind of neat.
1879200	1880200	I do not want.
1880200	1881200	That's weird.
1881200	1884000	Um, so, yeah, and there's some other stuff.
1884000	1887960	I know, this has already been announced that's coming out, so that's not a surprise.
1887960	1892680	This is new, though, Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies.
1892680	1895120	The Marvel Zombies series is just crazy.
1895120	1896120	Wow.
1896120	1899480	I don't know if you've read any of them, but they're nuts, and there was an Army of Darkness
1899480	1901040	vs. Marvel Zombies 2.
1901040	1902040	I thought you'd look like that.
1902040	1905680	So, there's going to be a set in the popular Marvel Zombies comic series.
1905680	1910960	You assume the role of Spider-Man and must save the world from zombie menaces that threaten
1910960	1912160	to destroy it.
1912160	1916880	Um, play this adventure game in an open city, free-swing environment, and a war-torn Earth,
1916880	1921240	and the game takes place in the year 2149 in the warped version of Earth.
1921240	1926600	Um, fight against other Marvel heroes and villains who you've already, who have already
1926600	1930320	succumbed to the zombie horde, or become a zombie yourself.
1930320	1932420	So, that's interesting.
1932420	1935160	I'm guessing that's probably coming out next year sometime.
1935160	1941440	Uh, Transformers 2 probably will suck, because the first one really sucked.
1941440	1946280	Obviously, this is something that's way far away, but probably going to come out around
1946280	1948960	the time of the next movie.
1948960	1954960	So, I think that was 2010, so, way, way off there.
1954960	1961840	And they have some generic stuff on that, um, let's see here, um, okay, this is a little
1961840	1962840	bit bigger.
1962840	1963840	Well, actually, this is weird too.
1963840	1969480	They have a balance board game using, or it's a Spider-Man game using the balance board.
1969480	1976280	It says, um, it might be Spider-Man's heart that keeps him going, or maybe his strength.
1976280	1980360	Step on, or step into Spider-Man's shoes and decide for yourself.
1980360	1983480	One jump, leap, stomp, and kick at a time.
1983480	1989600	Climb atop your Wii Fit board to control Spider-Man's acrobatic abilities like never before.
1989600	1994160	Lean one way or the other to send Spider-Man's story into the air.
1994160	1998720	Jump as high as you can to propel, uh, Spider-Man off of Manhattan's tallest rooftops.
1998720	2001840	I don't see how you could do that, because they don't want you jumping on the Wii balance
2001840	2004720	board, so, it'll be interesting.
2004720	2006760	Hmm, that's true.
2006760	2011640	Um, let's see here, Tiger Claw says the sequel is going to be called Transformers 2 Revenge
2011640	2014120	of the Fallen from our chat room.
2014120	2018680	Uh, then they had some stuff for Call of Duty 5, mainly 5 different box shots so that they're
2018680	2023800	deciding between, um, what they want to use, same with the Spider-Man web of shadows.
2023800	2029560	Finally the biggest one, um, this is coming from Forza 3, they had some stuff on that.
2029560	2033800	Forza 3, of course, you know, big racing game, uh, it says do the number of cars and tracks
2033800	2039120	included in Forza 3, it will be sold as a 2-disc set, it says, uh, key features of Forza
2039120	2045760	3 include highly detailed real world cars and track models, over 400 cars and 100 tracks,
2045760	2052040	near limitless customization options for cartooning and custom artwork, a variety of online community
2052040	2058080	features, highly accurate racing simulation, including real world damage, new race modes,
2058080	2063560	drag, drift, oval, point to point racing, etc., uh, powerful assist system to help new
2063560	2068200	players get into the game quickly, and, what else?
2068200	2071520	But all that is subject to change, obviously, because he's probably thinking that, yeah.
2071520	2076200	Yeah, this is all stuff that's going on right now, and it says also imagine that an exclusive
2076200	2081440	Forza 3 limited collector's edition was released that would include the full version of the
2081440	2086480	game plus membership in a special VIP program that would entitle the buyer to all future
2086480	2093380	Forza 3 downloadable content, access to exclusive online race events and prizes, VIP status
2093380	2099420	on Forza auction house and community boards, extra service space for photos and videos
2099420	2105000	in a free month of live, and the collector's edition will also include exclusive motorsports
2105000	2109840	content not found anywhere else, and it says this can be anything from authentic racing
2109840	2114400	gear, gloves, helmets, etc., to specially created automobile and manufactured gear,
2114400	2117760	branded jackets, etc., to VIP motorsport event tickets.
2117760	2122840	See, that sounds kind of cool, but like, this stuff's so early that it's probably just,
2122840	2127480	you know, what they want to do, and they're also kind of getting people's opinions on
2127480	2128480	this stuff.
2128480	2133760	You know, and if you dig even deeper in that NeoJF thread, people kept finding more stuff
2133760	2138600	on that site, like, I don't know, I didn't read into how the security hole was opened
2138600	2139600	or whatever, but.
2139600	2142760	It basically, well, I saw it earlier before they took everything down.
2142760	2143760	Oh, it's fixed now?
2143760	2147420	Because, yeah, it is fixed now, and there's some other stuff that was on there too, including
2147420	2154700	there's a game for, it was called Crucible that they had a video for.
2154700	2158920	Animal Planet Emergency Vet was a game that was on there, you know, like the show on Animal
2158920	2160320	Planet.
2160320	2165280	Bill Nye Science Lab on the Wii, no joke, Bill Nye the Science Guy finally gets a Wii
2165280	2166360	game.
2166360	2170120	That was like one of our dream games, wasn't it, I don't know, and then get this, You Don't
2170120	2175480	Know Jack on the Wii, finally, finally this game's coming back, thank God.
2175480	2178920	I know two other games that haven't been mentioned yet.
2178920	2180080	Oh, really?
2180080	2183040	They're also based off, like, TV shows, actually.
2183040	2184040	Oh.
2184040	2191160	Hell's Kitchen is getting a game, which I think is kind of funny, and The Price is Right.
2191160	2193080	Hell yeah!
2193080	2194080	What for Wii?
2194080	2197000	Wii and DS.
2197000	2200080	I don't know, though, it probably's gonna suck.
2200080	2203400	You just can't play Plinko at home, it's not the same, you know what I mean?
2203400	2204400	It's just not the same.
2204400	2205880	I don't know.
2205880	2206880	Alright.
2206880	2209640	They had a Price is Right game on Commodore 64, didn't they?
2209640	2210640	Years ago?
2210640	2212160	They had some pretty old ones.
2212160	2216240	I was seeing some other stuff on here, too, and I'm sure a lot of people now are starting
2216240	2224680	to make up stuff to go along with this, but, I don't know, it's interesting.
2224680	2228520	I think a lot of the stuff you're going to see at E3, and shit, it's only a few more
2228520	2229520	weeks away, really.
2229520	2230960	I mean, E3, what, a month away?
2230960	2235520	Well, I'm very curious to see what the fallout from all of this is, what the response is
2235520	2236520	from Microsoft tomorrow.
2236520	2238600	Oh, it's going to be a lot of do not comment shit, that's all it's going to be.
2238600	2242880	I'm very curious to see Microsoft's comment tomorrow, besides, you know, the standard
2242880	2246880	anything you can do, I can do better.
2246880	2247880	It is very interesting.
2247880	2251720	It sounds like they do have a lot of stuff up their sleeves.
2251720	2254880	And they said they had a few aces still up their sleeves for stuff, so.
2254880	2257600	Well, A for Ace Avatar, I don't know.
2257600	2258600	Alright.
2258600	2262320	And after Matt says in chat, Price is Right for the Wii, Itagaki better do it, so he get
2262320	2267080	the bouncy titties, because you know that's why people watch the Price is Right.
2267080	2268080	Oh my God.
2268080	2269080	Come on down!
2269080	2270080	Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga.
2270080	2271080	They should totally.
2271080	2272080	Too bad it's all grandmas.
2272080	2273080	Totally.
2273080	2279000	Like we were saying back, you know, last week, how Itagaki would do, like, you know, how
2279000	2283160	I appear, he would do, like, a press event or whatever, you know, kicking over stuff,
2283160	2286160	you know, saying things on fire, that kind of thing.
2286160	2287560	That would apply to Price is Right, too.
2287560	2288760	I think that would be pretty awesome.
2288760	2289760	That would be.
2289760	2291760	We're making a Price is Right game, bitch.
2291760	2292760	Alright.
2292760	2295080	Alright, so definitely lots more to come.
2295080	2298760	That story, of course, all still in development, was very new.
2298760	2300600	We'll see how this develops throughout the week.
2300600	2304160	Meanwhile, let's get into the news we were going to talk about anyway tonight, even though
2304160	2307020	that took like 20 minutes to cover, but that's pretty big.
2307020	2310360	Let's quickly run through some of the other week's news and let you guys comment.
2310360	2311360	Alright.
2311360	2319920	Christopher says, Microsoft's comment, fuck, you didn't just hear that.
2319920	2325080	Nintendo is suing Nyko over the Comma Wireless Nunchuk, which doesn't really make much sense
2325080	2328800	to me when I think about it, because, you know, people put out third party accessories
2328800	2329920	all the time.
2329920	2334240	I guess Nintendo is just really super anal about people putting out, you know, third
2334240	2337880	party remotes and nunchucks, because actually if you think about it, I remember Mad Cats
2337880	2343200	was putting out a third party remote that kind of looked like a dildo, but actually
2343200	2345000	that's never come out yet.
2345000	2349640	So I'm wondering if these people are just getting blocked by Nintendo for this stuff,
2349640	2356680	but either way, they are suing them because apparently it appropriates the novel shape,
2356680	2363120	design, overall appearance, and even the colored materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuk controller.
2363120	2367760	Except it's also wireless, but apparently it's similar enough, and people are thinking
2367760	2370800	hey, maybe Nintendo is making their own wireless nunchuck.
2370800	2375000	I doubt that, but, I don't know, it still sucks.
2375000	2380120	So if you're looking to buy a wireless nunchuck, do it now, before they're pulled from shelves.
2380120	2383060	Do you think this has any merit on Nintendo's part?
2383060	2387640	It's just weird because there's tons of third party controllers out there, why this one?
2387640	2392400	It's true that, you know, it has merit, but at the same time though, I thought that this
2392400	2398120	stuff has to be approved through Nintendo first, before they make these peripherals,
2398120	2400360	they have to approve it with Nintendo.
2400360	2404240	Because the same could be said with the Wii Zapper, there's a bunch of things that came
2404240	2409040	out before the Wii Zapper that were pretty much exactly the same as the Wii Zapper.
2409040	2414060	And some things, in fact, Nyko even made a better peripheral than the Wii Zapper for
2414060	2415060	gun games.
2415060	2418240	But I don't know, it sucks.
2418240	2421960	I don't know, because it's something that people want, so they're going to buy it.
2421960	2426000	I don't think they're going to lose any nunchuck sales on this, maybe they will a little bit,
2426000	2430980	but they're really, I don't know, money hungry if that's the case.
2430980	2436840	But I guess at the same time, they also have to protect their patents and stuff, so maybe
2436840	2438140	that's why they're doing this.
2438140	2443280	But either way though, there should have been some sort of process where they have to get
2443280	2449040	approval from Nintendo to put out these products, or I don't know, usually that's the way it
2449040	2452160	works I thought.
2452160	2457280	All right, well we'll see what happens if they get the pants suit off of them, or what
2457280	2458440	will happen.
2458440	2461120	But you think Nintendo just want to put out a wireless thing of their own, is that what's
2461120	2462120	going on?
2462120	2463120	I don't know.
2463120	2465760	Jamie, what do you think of this whole lawsuit stuff?
2465760	2471080	I think it's just Nintendo trying to keep the market under their control.
2471080	2476200	Well, Nintendo did this this week, and it's not Nintendo as a company, but one person
2476200	2479920	at Nintendo, but when you hire a person like this as your marketing director, he's speaking
2479920	2484900	on behalf of your company, and this guy pissed me off this week, I don't know about you guys.
2484900	2491920	This was in Edge Magazine, and Nintendo of Europe marketing director, Laurent Fisher,
2491920	2496840	was talking about the whole, he got of course, as most Nintendo people have, got kind of
2496840	2500120	put on the spot lately while he was talking about WiiWare games.
2500120	2503000	Where is the extra storage?
2503000	2507240	What about all these people that are filling up their Wii consoles with all this stuff?
2507240	2508480	Where is the extra storage?
2508480	2515720	Well, according to Laurent Fisher, only geeks and otaku want the issue addressed.
2515720	2518280	Here's the actual quote from the magazine here.
2518280	2521720	You can read their little site online at next-gen.biz.
2521720	2525400	When a question about the limited Wii system memory was raised, Nintendo's Laurent Fisher
2525400	2530720	slipped into talking about how geeks and otaku were the only people who would want this issue
2530720	2531720	addressed.
2531720	2535520	Yeah, that would be their entire fan base.
2535520	2538120	Duh.
2538120	2540440	Then he went and tried to backtrack a little later.
2540440	2543440	He was talking to video gaming 24-7.
2543440	2547680	He didn't mean to offend anyone, and it's all a misunderstanding.
2547680	2548680	You know what?
2548680	2555120	I don't know how much more cut and dry that could be, or how that could be misconstrued
2555120	2556520	to mean anything else.
2556520	2561680	Geek and otaku, first of all, apart from being slightly synonymous, except with otaku having
2561680	2569280	a slightly bigger social stigma overseas, is still...
2569280	2572400	Your freaking marketing director?
2572400	2574000	You want to appeal to these people.
2574000	2578520	I know Nintendo is trying to get the broader audience and trying to get the moms and grandmoms
2578520	2585800	into it, but still, their core fan base is the nerdy gamer, sorry.
2585800	2586800	And here's the problem.
2586800	2592360	Every particular geek has spent lots of money on these virtual console downloads, downloading
2592360	2597360	the same shit I played years ago, when I could be playing them for free on the internet.
2597360	2599880	But no, I decided to support Nintendo.
2599880	2604280	I decided to download these games and actually pay the price for them so I could have the
2604280	2608560	official emulator and support the people behind it, and this is how we get thanked?
2608560	2610720	I downloaded ZSNES.
2610720	2611720	I know, that's what I'm saying.
2611720	2615520	I could have done that, and I could have never supported the whole virtual console thing.
2615520	2619320	I would have the space on my drive to do more WiiWare games, and I wouldn't have to worry
2619320	2621520	about any of this.
2621520	2623000	No.
2623000	2625400	But then, this is the thanks we get for supporting Nintendo.
2625400	2627200	You're a geek.
2627200	2629080	So you know what?
2629080	2631120	Fuck you.
2631120	2634440	I am not downloading anything else on virtual console.
2634440	2635440	I don't give a shit.
2635440	2637920	They could put Guardian Legend out on it tomorrow.
2637920	2638920	I'm not getting it.
2638920	2642840	I will play it on NES emulators, thank you very much, and be happy.
2642840	2645400	I will not download any more WiiWare titles.
2645400	2652640	I will not support Nintendo's download service until A, this guy is let go or shifted into
2652640	2656720	another position where he's not speaking on behalf of the company, or B, Nintendo addresses
2656720	2657720	this issue.
2657720	2658720	That's it.
2658720	2664760	Personally, I'm not going to suffer because of one idiot, but I think that it would probably
2664760	2671640	be a bit more, I would have to say, well, first of all, they're not going to know that
2671640	2677080	you're doing this if you just do it and they're not going to listen to our podcast.
2677080	2678080	I know.
2678080	2682780	I'm hoping maybe some of the listeners will kind of wake up as well and maybe join me
2682780	2683860	in this little boycott.
2683860	2690360	I think that a movement, and I'm going to use that term, has no real power unless the
2690360	2695440	ones you're moving against know what you're doing.
2695440	2702320	So why not put together some type of organized effort to address it?
2702320	2706660	It's one thing to say we're going to do this on the show, but another thing to actually
2706660	2712720	send a letter to Nintendo, to the CEO US, to the ones in the UK.
2712720	2717340	So are you saying I should start some type of blog where I encourage people to send letters
2717340	2718340	and join me in this boycott?
2718340	2719340	Why not?
2719340	2720340	All right.
2720340	2721340	I'll do it tomorrow.
2721340	2722340	Okay.
2722340	2723340	All right.
2723340	2724340	We're doing it.
2724340	2725340	We are?
2725340	2726340	We are.
2726340	2727340	We're doing it.
2727340	2728340	Okay.
2728340	2729340	And you're signing it.
2729340	2730340	Hey, I'm fine with it.
2730340	2733180	I haven't really been downloading anything from Nintendo's WiiWare service anyways.
2733180	2735660	My download service actually isn't working, but I did want posting once now.
2735660	2739340	That's the thing is I've been trying to support Nintendo and that's why you might just think,
2739340	2744180	Rob, get over it, but it's one of these things where like, dude, this is the marketing director.
2744180	2745180	This is what he's going to say.
2745180	2747500	Isn't that marketing director UK?
2747500	2748500	It doesn't matter.
2748500	2756140	But I'm saying, you know, we're going to have to, the letters have to go to him, to whoever
2756140	2765420	his boss is in Nintendo UK, to over here and probably even to the overall head officer.
2765420	2770020	You know, dark Tetsuya says, Oh, please, Rob, you'll download the guardian legend if they
2770020	2771020	put it out tomorrow.
2771020	2772020	No, I won't.
2772020	2773680	Rob can come over to my house and play it.
2773680	2774680	I can play.
2774680	2779220	Go download it on an emulator and I guess I'll be just fine.
2779220	2781060	Just fine.
2781060	2782060	So there you have it.
2782060	2783060	Let's see.
2783060	2784060	What does Game Guru say?
2784060	2786660	Nintendo will fix the issue for Animal Crossing at E3.
2786660	2789540	If they don't, I will join this boycott.
2789540	2794580	Game Guru, I actually think my boycott will be over by E3 because I think, like I said,
2794580	2802940	I will un-boycott when they address this issue finally and stop pretending it doesn't exist.
2802940	2807580	And if it doesn't get addressed, then it just justifies the boycott even more.
2807580	2814860	So it's still one thing has got to get enough people to participate when a shadow try says,
2814860	2816060	Oh, now you go back on it.
2816060	2817060	No, I'm not.
2817060	2820160	I said the boycott will be over when a, this guy gets let go or B, Nintendo addresses the
2820160	2823860	issue and it's widely anticipated and Nintendo will address the issue at E3 with some type
2823860	2825340	of storage device.
2825340	2829940	But I don't think they're going to come out at E3 and say, Hey, just for geeks, no tacos.
2829940	2834660	Well, that's so fucking lame anyways, because your average, you know, anybody that's using
2834660	2838820	the Wii console needs the storage space because they didn't think it through very well.
2838820	2841260	They were trying to cut costs to make this thing very, you know.
2841260	2844740	Why are you bragging that there's a hundred, I'm sorry, this isn't you, this isn't Nintendo.
2844740	2848580	Why are you bragging there's a hundred plus different games you can download on virtual
2848580	2852100	console when your stupid thing won't even hold it, you know, more than 20?
2852100	2858140	Well, one other thing though that I would like to say is that Nintendo does have a track
2858140	2862580	record for creating the demand for something.
2862580	2867120	And then when people are worked up enough about it, they'll release the product.
2867120	2871860	So I would not be at all surprised if they didn't have something like this already in
2871860	2877600	mind that they put out this massive amount of downloadable content, stuff that's going
2877600	2879460	to fill up all this space.
2879460	2882380	And then when people are like, what do we do, what do we do?
2882380	2886140	Nintendo comes to save the day with a storage unit, you know, something like that.
2886140	2889580	Hit stun says, somebody called you a geek and you're going to boycott over it.
2889580	2890580	Um, sorta.
2890580	2891580	Yeah.
2891580	2894420	Because if I mentioned a derogatory fashion, yes, because it was meant in a derogatory
2894420	2895420	fashion.
2895420	2898740	And if we've been supporting the company for all this years and this is the thanks we get,
2898740	2900420	then I'm not going to support it anymore.
2900420	2902980	Well, that's, that's the issue.
2902980	2907500	Online plays for geeks and a tacos.
2907500	2908500	I don't know.
2908500	2909500	Yeah.
2909500	2914220	Avatars are for non-friend codes are for geeks and tacos.
2914220	2915220	Geeks and tacos.
2915220	2916220	No.
2916220	2917220	Oh, tacos.
2917220	2920660	If he said download things were for tacos, I would be, yeah.
2920660	2921660	Tacos are rad.
2921660	2922660	Okay.
2922660	2927300	Um, I'm going to, I'm going to give a GameStop gift certificate to anyone who comes over
2927300	2932260	here and brings us chicken, soft tacos.
2932260	2933260	Nobody knows where we live.
2933260	2934260	Some people do.
2934260	2935260	I live.
2935260	2936260	All right.
2936260	2937980	Look, I'm, I'm done with my rant.
2937980	2939260	I'm sure we'll get emails on it.
2939260	2940660	Let's go on to the next story.
2940660	2942000	Oh yeah.
2942000	2943000	We have that.
2943000	2944000	Don't we?
2944000	2945000	Yes.
2945000	2949780	Um, for, uh, people who are going to be downloading this stuff who may or may not be participating,
2949780	2954880	but only in the UK, we have, um, five new games out in virtual console.
2954880	2960020	We have, um, Alex Kidd Miracle World, which is a good, good game.
2960020	2964900	Um, and that is actually going to be 500 Wii points.
2964900	2970660	There is, um, Last Ninja and Nebulas for Commodore 64.
2970660	2974620	And, um, both of those are 500 Wii points.
2974620	2977780	And then for Neo Geo, we have Ninja Combat and Fatal Fury 2.
2977780	2981760	And those are going to be 900 Wii points.
2981760	2982980	Guess what, Rob?
2982980	2988140	You can actually come over to my house and play Fatal Fury 2 on my Neo Geo.
2988140	2989140	I'll do that.
2989140	2990140	Do you want to?
2990140	2991140	Yeah.
2991140	2992140	Okay.
2992140	2993940	Cause I think those Neo Geo cartridges have more storage than a Nintendo Wii.
2993940	2995780	512 megabytes.
2995780	3000180	So yeah, there's the same amount of storage in one of those fucking carts than there is
3000180	3001180	in the Nintendo Wii.
3001180	3002180	Same amount.
3002180	3005940	I would say that, yeah, they're 512 a piece.
3005940	3008780	I'm sorry, but flash memory is not that expensive.
3008780	3012260	And I don't understand why they couldn't have added more to this.
3012260	3018980	I think seeing as the device will already read a USB thing and or, or it will copy to
3018980	3020260	your SD card.
3020260	3023740	I don't see they could do it with a freaking patch.
3023740	3028140	They could patch the system there to temporarily load things off your SD card into the flash
3028140	3029140	memory.
3029140	3032900	I don't know about piracy, you know, with their Wii people already pirate.
3032900	3033900	Yeah, exactly.
3033900	3034980	People already know how to do it.
3034980	3037020	It's not going to matter anymore.
3037020	3041180	So oh well.
3041180	3048620	In other news, unrelated to Nintendo, Famitsu Magazine, you know, they're definitely one
3048620	3051620	of the most popular gaming magazines in Japan.
3051620	3055820	And if you want to get your grubby little hands on it, a subscription, it's going to
3055820	3057580	cost you quite a bit of money.
3057580	3065700	However, NCSX is offering import subscriptions to Famitsu Magazine, ranging anywhere and
3065700	3074420	I hope you have the money for this anywhere from $480 a year to $2,860 a year $480 per
3074420	3080740	year for issue or 52 issues because is a weekly magazine considering they're being shipped
3080740	3081740	from Japan.
3081740	3082740	That's actually not that bad.
3082740	3083740	Exactly.
3083740	3091820	Yeah, for media mail and UPS overnight shipping would be $2,860 because it's overnight shipping
3091820	3096940	that priority mail only $626 so you can do the same thing through Amazon and have been
3096940	3100940	able to for a long time because I could I had a for a little while subscription to the
3100940	3103620	Doctor Who magazine nerd.
3103620	3108220	So you can also geek otaku just about whatever Rob I said it big fat.
3108220	3111140	So what about that but this is nothing new.
3111140	3114740	I mean, they're just doing the same thing that you've been able to do for Amazon for
3114740	3115740	ages and ages.
3115740	3118660	So nothing wrong with a little competition.
3118660	3120340	I can get prices down.
3120340	3124340	I could go to Kinokuniya and buy them every week too.
3124340	3129500	So all right, but but there is something you know overnighting it to your door.
3129500	3130980	That is kind of neat.
3130980	3137220	But yeah, I guess Amazon huh a week later and every so often Kinokuniya will clear them
3137220	3139780	out, you know, a couple weeks after that for half price.
3139780	3145340	Well, hopefully something something coming to your door soon will be Mega Man 9.
3145340	3151980	If this is to be believed Capcom apparently is recently registered Mega Man 9 under Australia's
3151980	3153480	version of the ESRB.
3153480	3158340	That would be the Office of Film and Literature Classification the OFLC.
3158340	3161720	Apparently the game is going to be multi platform.
3161720	3165460	So that could be pretty interesting especially when you consider a couple weeks ago didn't
3165460	3169340	Capcom say something about reviving one of their dead franchises or there was going to
3169340	3170340	be a couple.
3170340	3171340	Yeah.
3171340	3174780	And Mega Man 9 would be the revival of a pretty dormant franchise.
3174780	3179220	I mean if you take out Battle Network and you know X and all that other stuff we haven't
3179220	3181380	seen a Mega Man game since the PS1.
3181380	3183900	So that would certainly be a welcome surprise I think.
3183900	3185780	I certainly would love to see a Mega Man 9.
3185780	3190060	I hope it has the cheesy anime sequences that Mega Man 8 had.
3190060	3191060	You know what I want to see?
3191060	3192060	Huh?
3192060	3201020	I want to see a redo of Mega Man 2 with the higher end graphics I think as long as it
3201020	3202020	plays the same way.
3202020	3204780	Well there was sort of that thing on GameCube the anniversary condition.
3204780	3208420	Yeah but I want shiny.
3208420	3212900	Here's what I would like to see the Mega Man otaku geek in me would like to see.
3212900	3217260	I would like to see them kind of do that like what you're saying but have the first three
3217260	3223200	Mega Man games all combined where you could go into the different stages like let's say
3223200	3227940	you could go play in Bubble Man's stage and then go to Top Man's stage and then to Cuts
3227940	3230180	Man's stage and you could kind of like all of them combined.
3230180	3232380	We need a new Rocket Man the power battles.
3232380	3234220	That would be kind of cool.
3234220	3235220	That would be hot.
3235220	3238620	AJ Mix calls it Mega Man 2 HD Remix.
3238620	3239620	Why not?
3239620	3240620	Put it on Xbox 360.
3240620	3241620	Exactly.
3241620	3242620	Why not?
3242620	3243620	Sounds like fun.
3243620	3244620	Alright.
3244620	3250740	You know what we should download extra stuff on Xbox 360 and put that include that in our
3250740	3251740	letter.
3251740	3257620	I already download a lot on Xbox 360 there's really that's really nothing new so I have
3257620	3261740	that thing set to automatically download all demos which was a pretty brilliant idea but
3261740	3264780	Xbox can do that because the hard drives are huge they're 20 gigs.
3264780	3266260	I've yet to film it.
3266260	3269820	And if you need more space there is a 120 gig hard drive available.
3269820	3271660	Exactly that 20 gigs has been more than enough.
3271660	3272660	And if you're industrious.
3272660	3275540	Especially especially after I deleted Final Fantasy 11.
3275540	3279540	It's been more than enough space because I don't really watch movies on it but if I did
3279540	3285100	I could go get that 120 or you know they have the you can put stuff on USB memory card da
3285100	3287740	da da da da da da.
3287740	3291860	Act Def calls it kind of like the Sonic 2 HD version some guys are doing.
3291860	3293180	Well kind of.
3293180	3296620	Alpha Cannongram says Sky Mega Man anniversary collection for GameCube sucks.
3296620	3300620	Oh yeah I forgot there's a whole GameCube versus PS2 even though the GameCube had the
3300620	3303820	remix music it screwed with the buttons and all that.
3303820	3305100	All right fine whatever.
3305100	3306500	You know what I meant.
3306500	3308500	I'm still excited about Mega Man 9.
3308500	3311100	Well that is actually pretty cool.
3311100	3312100	You know.
3312100	3317820	But for our people who like their video games turned into movies like me as long as they're
3317820	3320780	not fucked up.
3320780	3326900	There is some news about Onimusha and Clock Tower movies and actually the Clock Tower
3326900	3331060	movie still has Christoph Ganz still attached to it.
3331060	3332420	So that's pretty cool.
3332420	3334780	That's cool because I like Silent Hill.
3334780	3336220	I for one liked it.
3336220	3344340	And that one's got a I'm trying well I think actually that and Onimusha are set to come
3344340	3345340	out 2011.
3345340	3346340	So.
3346340	3348740	Actually no I take that back.
3348740	3354300	Onimusha is going to be out I'm not Onimusha will be out in 2011 and Clock Tower will be
3354300	3360780	out next year possibly but it better not suck.
3360780	3361780	Go camp out now.
3361780	3362780	You know what.
3362780	3363780	You know what Rob.
3363780	3364780	What.
3364780	3367620	We need a Fatal Frame movie.
3367620	3369900	I still want to see the Silent Hill 2 movie get made.
3369900	3370900	Yes I know.
3370900	3373100	I thought they were making a Fatal Frame movie.
3373100	3374100	Are they?
3374100	3375100	I thought.
3375100	3376100	I don't know.
3376100	3377100	That'd be cool.
3377100	3378100	We'll see.
3378100	3379100	Me too.
3379100	3387260	So we got a lot of stuff coming out this week in game releases in the U.S. on PC.
3387260	3389260	Political Machines 2008.
3389260	3396940	Yes you too can now take part of your own I don't know political election.
3396940	3405220	Also this week we've got the Spore Creature Creator for PC if you want to you know have
3405220	3408420	a little piece of spore to play until the actual game comes out.
3408420	3411220	Although apparently if you know where to look you can already get it.
3411220	3412220	That's the demo.
3412220	3413420	And I hear it's quite good.
3413420	3414420	That's the demo.
3414420	3415420	Oh.
3415420	3416420	Still.
3416420	3417420	I hear it's quite good.
3417420	3418420	Yes.
3418420	3420520	I haven't played it myself but I hear it's good.
3420520	3426900	Also this week Space Invaders Extreme on the PSP and DS definitely worth checking out.
3426900	3428100	Finally.
3428100	3434620	Imagine Rockstar on the DS not quite as cool as Imagine Babies but whatever.
3434620	3436460	Imagine Babies is still in my backpack.
3436460	3438260	Special in its own way.
3438260	3441020	Wacky Races Crash and Dash.
3441020	3442020	Yes.
3442020	3445580	That's based off of that really old cartoon series.
3445580	3446740	Does anyone still remember it?
3446740	3447740	I don't know.
3447740	3448740	No.
3448740	3453900	Code Lyoko, Fall of Izana is coming on the DS.
3453900	3457340	Secret Agent Clank on the PSP.
3457340	3460100	Ubisoft's whoring yet another pets franchise.
3460100	3462380	Pets Dogs Fashion.
3462380	3463380	That's right.
3463380	3466500	Dogs dressed up like things.
3466500	3467940	Interesting.
3467940	3470020	But not.
3470020	3472900	Stop anthropomorphizing our animals.
3472900	3474900	Arkanoid on the DS.
3474900	3475900	That's pretty cool.
3475900	3479380	Tamagotchi Connection Corner 3.
3479380	3485680	We've got the Rock Band Special Edition which is coming out next Sunday on the Wii.
3485680	3491500	Also Guitar Hero On Tour will be coming out on the DS as well.
3491500	3494940	And I believe that's it.
3494940	3500180	Probably slow week for game releases actually.
3500180	3502660	Not too much more upbeat over in Japan either.
3502660	3506420	It's kind of a slow period for release dates in Japan but on the Xbox 360 on June 19th
3506420	3511980	you can pick up Flat Out Ultimate Carnage if you want to get that because their releases
3511980	3514940	tend to be on Fridays.
3514940	3519460	Over on the Playstation 3, not a lot coming out this week.
3519460	3521060	Stay tuned for next week.
3521060	3526020	On the Nintendo Wii you can pick up Puyo Puyo which has now been reduced in price.
3526020	3530700	You can also get Super Mario Stadium Family Baseball is coming out on the 19th as well.
3530700	3535180	Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian comes out in Japan, a localized version there.
3535180	3541740	And Harukanaru Jiku no Kade 4 comes out from Koei on the 19th as well.
3541740	3546060	Taking a look at the PS2 for those of you that still love that.
3546060	3551040	Another version of Harukanaru Jiku no Kade comes out on the Playstation 2.
3551040	3556140	So Love Drops and Odin Sphere get moved into the best meaning they get price drops.
3556140	3560860	And Sora Yume also comes out on the Playstation 2.
3560860	3567820	Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS we have Nippon Shuzan Renmei Kanshu Itsu
3567820	3571500	Demosoroban DS comes out.
3571500	3572500	Also another version of Puyo Puyo.
3572500	3573980	The pronunciation is getting a lot better Rob.
3573980	3577420	Since I've been doing this for a long time now it's getting slowly better.
3577420	3579580	Just remember everything is either A, I, U, A, O.
3579580	3582300	Okay, I'm trying.
3582300	3586020	Spectral Force Genesis comes out on the Nintendo DS.
3586020	3589140	And Watashi no Pony comes out.
3589140	3590140	My Pony.
3590140	3592860	Yes, it's like My Pony.
3592860	3594380	It's not My Little Pony.
3594380	3595380	Is this My Pony?
3595380	3599040	It's just My Pony.
3599040	3601580	But it is definitely a pony game for the DS.
3601580	3602580	There's no mistake.
3602580	3604900	There's a big old pony right there on the cover.
3604900	3606500	So something to look for.
3606500	3611940	And My Health Coach Weight Management comes to all Asian regions this week as well on
3611940	3612940	the Nintendo DS.
3612940	3616820	Although I'm thinking I don't know a lot of Husky Asians.
3616820	3620060	I'm thinking that's a game they need to release over here a little quicker.
3620060	3622180	I think it is out over here though.
3622180	3626840	On the Sony PSP God of War Chains of Olympus comes out in Chinese.
3626840	3628860	It's localized for Chinese so that's coming out this week.
3628860	3631660	That's not Japan but you know Asia in general.
3631660	3632840	Comes out over there.
3632840	3637060	Also coming out on the Sony PSP Secret Agent Clank.
3637060	3638980	Super Robot Tyson a portable.
3638980	3639980	Sweet.
3639980	3643820	There aren't enough Super Robot Wars.
3643820	3645020	That's really it.
3645020	3649580	Also the headset and remote come out for the PSP this week in Japan.
3649580	3650660	There you have it.
3650660	3654940	I want the one of those that has the Avas in it.
3654940	3655940	The Robot Tyson.
3655940	3659140	I think it was one of the Saturn ones.
3659140	3660140	Very cool.
3660140	3661140	Is it my turn?
3661140	3662140	It is your turn.
3662140	3663140	It's in the UK.
3663140	3664140	Lots of them.
3664140	3665140	Well a few of them.
3665140	3666140	But on lots of systems.
3666140	3671540	We have Alone in the Dark for Wii, PS2, PC and Xbox 360.
3671540	3674660	Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 on PSP.
3674660	3675660	About Time.
3675660	3677380	Gauntlet on DS.
3677380	3678940	I like Gauntlet.
3678940	3686040	The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian on PSP, Xbox 360, DS, PS2, Wii PC, PS3 and Top
3686040	3690020	Spin on Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360.
3690020	3694020	Not to be confused with that really cool car show Top Gear.
3694020	3697580	I'm looking at Justin TV chat right now which I don't usually watch during the show but
3697580	3700900	I know we have some people who can only watch on Justin TV because for whatever reason the
3700900	3702780	other ways to listen to this are banned.
3702780	3707220	Ikuma JP who actually lives in Japan pays me a compliment and says I understand Skye's
3707220	3708460	Japanese now.
3708460	3709900	That is quite the compliment actually.
3709900	3710900	I never had a lesson.
3710900	3717380	I was just saying it really is I guess with practice you know and I have noticed you picking
3717380	3719380	up a little vocabulary.
3719380	3720380	A little.
3720380	3721380	A little.
3721380	3722380	A little.
3722380	3723380	Rob's picking up stuff.
3723380	3724540	Pretty soon I'm going to start answering my phone.
3724540	3725540	Moshi Moshi.
3725540	3726540	Alright.
3726540	3729060	Also, Ikuma JP brings up that whole difference.
3729060	3731060	Is Mega Man the same thing as Rock Man?
3731060	3732060	Yes.
3732060	3733700	Rock Man is what it is in Japan and Europe.
3733700	3735980	I don't know why they called it Mega Man here.
3735980	3739740	I'm thinking that maybe they thought if they called the game Rock Man people would have
3739740	3741900	thought it was like a rock band or rock music.
3741900	3746580	Well, there was the girl assistant was Roll.
3746580	3747580	I know.
3747580	3748580	Rock and roll.
3748580	3749580	I know.
3749580	3750580	It makes perfect sense.
3750580	3754420	Maybe is it because like Guts Man was kind of a rock character and they didn't want people
3754420	3756020	to think he was a bad guy.
3756020	3757020	I don't know.
3757020	3758020	I don't know.
3758020	3761180	Because people don't get it.
3761180	3762180	It's weird.
3762180	3765300	They did have a lot of those changes back in the day.
3765300	3766300	Random.
3766300	3769580	And the really ugly cover that Mega Man 2 had.
3769580	3770580	Oh my God.
3770580	3773900	This is when Capcom was like let's Americanize all of the art.
3773900	3775780	That was a pretty awesome cover.
3775780	3779420	The only I think good one that was done was one of the Metal Gear ones that looked like
3779420	3781780	it had Michael Bayne on it.
3781780	3783700	I was like dude Terminator.
3783700	3786380	Akuma, you got to check that out if you've never seen it.
3786380	3790620	Go to Google art and search for the Mega Man 2 box art because it's pretty epic.
3790620	3794420	In fact, if you live overseas and you've never seen it, it's pretty hilarious.
3794420	3795660	Prepare to weep.
3795660	3796780	All right.
3796780	3797780	It's hideous.
3797780	3798780	All right.
3798780	3799780	Let's get back to some gaming news.
3799780	3800780	Sorry, Loki.
3800780	3801780	All right.
3801780	3804340	Well, with E3 right around the corner, of course, it's about this time of the year where
3804340	3810100	people start making their lists of games that have been announced to be discussed during
3810100	3811100	E3.
3811100	3817140	IGN, of course, is one of those websites that's doing that and some interesting things have
3817140	3818180	come out of that.
3818180	3822660	One thing that's popped up, there are two untitled Capcom projects that weren't shown
3822660	3825500	off at the recent Captivate event.
3825500	3828340	And they're thinking Dead Rising 2 perhaps.
3828340	3830700	Oh, they're so close.
3830700	3831700	They're so close.
3831700	3832700	Warmer.
3832700	3833700	Getting warmer.
3833700	3834700	You're so close.
3834700	3835700	You're warm.
3835700	3840420	I don't know what the other one is, but we know what one of them is.
3840420	3843740	Bionic Commando Rearmed.
3843740	3848460	But I guess considering that E3 is coming out mid-July, it'd probably be out before
3848460	3850180	then.
3850180	3856300	And Halo Wars was there, but Alan Wake was not.
3856300	3858380	And the list is still very incomplete right now.
3858380	3863660	So there's, you know, no Atari, Codemasters, Crave, Disney, Eidos, Konami, LucasArts,
3863660	3871020	MTV, Nintendo, Sega, Sony Online, Square Enix, Take Two, Tecmo, THQ, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers
3871020	3872380	Interactive.
3872380	3876660	So that's a big gap right there.
3876660	3878220	A big list.
3878220	3884700	But I'm sorry, I'm reading in chat about the whole Rockman versus Mega Man thing, and GameGuru
3884700	3887880	is saying Rocks is slang for crack.
3887880	3891500	So maybe that's why they didn't want to release it here, because people would have thought
3891500	3892500	it was Crack Man.
3892500	3895700	So I don't know, if you release a game called Crack Man, I think it might actually sell
3895700	3897420	pretty well.
3897420	3900860	And then Dark Sakura, our very own, followed that up in chat, saying also Rocks would be
3900860	3901860	slang for nads.
3901860	3903420	Thank you for pointing that out.
3903420	3910660	But it was pointed out by Shauron that everything is slang for either some kind of drug or something
3910660	3913340	to do with sex, and I said that everyone likes sex and drugs.
3913340	3914340	It's true.
3914340	3915340	It can be.
3915340	3916340	It's true.
3916340	3917580	But not everybody, for real.
3917580	3919060	Some people.
3919060	3923860	Did you know that Pac Man overseas is called Puck Man?
3923860	3924860	Yes, I did.
3924860	3925860	P-U-C-K Man.
3925860	3927940	And you know why they didn't release that here?
3927940	3930460	Because they were afraid that people were going to take their magic markers and color
3930460	3936100	over the P with an F. I swear to God, I read it on Wikipedia, therefore it's true.
3936100	3937100	Rob.
3937100	3938100	What?
3938100	3939100	Rob.
3939100	3940100	Rob.
3940100	3941100	Rob.
3941100	3942100	Rob.
3942100	3943100	What?
3943100	3944100	Next story.
3944100	3945100	All right.
3945100	3946100	Sure, we can do that.
3946100	3947100	And I don't know, Jamie, this might be of interest to you.
3947100	3950980	Have you ever wanted to have a life-size solid snake statue?
3950980	3954380	Uh, hey?
3954380	3955380	Why not?
3955380	3957260	You know, shit, we ought to get one of these for the studio.
3957260	3958980	That would be kind of rad, actually.
3958980	3959980	It's a fucking auction.
3959980	3960980	All right.
3960980	3961980	Well, here's the thing.
3961980	3968060	What Sam's Club is doing, Sam's Club is actually selling a life-size statue of the old snake,
3968060	3970860	and it's being sold starting this upcoming week.
3970860	3974760	Unfortunately, it's not something you can actually go into the store and buy.
3974760	3976460	It's being auctioned.
3976460	3980940	And it's actually in a Walmart blog that originally announced this called Checkout.
3980940	3983540	I had no idea that there were blogs about Walmart.
3983540	3987000	You learn new things every day.
3987000	3991700	You can find it on auctions.samsclub.com, and if you search for Metal Gear Solid, you
3991700	3997620	can find the stand-up, which I would love to have one of here in studio, but somehow
3997620	3998620	I don't think that's going to happen.
3998620	3999620	In fact, I want to see...
3999620	4004740	I'm going to guess that's probably going to go for a lot of money.
4004740	4006580	There's only one thing I've ever won on...
4006580	4007700	Is the money going to charity or anything?
4007700	4008920	I'm sure it will be.
4008920	4012180	There's only one thing I've ever won from a charity auction, and it's a fully...
4012180	4014660	I tried to search for it, and it says sold out.
4014660	4016580	So what's up with that?
4016580	4019100	Maybe it doesn't start until Monday or something.
4019100	4020100	Yeah.
4020100	4023700	I've won one thing off of a charity auction for gaming-related stuff.
4023700	4024700	Really?
4024700	4025700	True Crime New York City.
4025700	4028460	I have a poster signed by the entire cast.
4028460	4029460	Huh.
4029460	4031860	It's at work, though, framed.
4031860	4034980	I didn't even know that was something you were really a fan of.
4034980	4040000	True Crime New York City, before the game actually came out and sucked, looked like
4040000	4043620	a pretty cool Grand Theft Auto game, and I like True Crime L.A., and that was kind of
4043620	4044620	fun.
4044620	4046980	So, I don't know.
4046980	4049300	I bought it, and it was cool.
4049300	4051660	It was the poster that they had, the little teaser poster, before they announced that
4051660	4052660	it was New York City.
4052660	4055500	You were supposed to guess, you know, what city it was.
4055500	4056500	Right, right.
4056500	4057500	Yeah.
4057500	4060420	Apparently, this auction is not up until next week, but I'll tell you what.
4060420	4063620	If it's a reasonable price, I might go put a bid on it.
4063620	4064620	We'll see.
4064620	4066980	But I'll probably get outbid pretty quick.
4066980	4067980	I think it'll be fun.
4067980	4070500	Wouldn't you like to have Solid Snake sitting in the corner of the studio?
4070500	4073260	Maybe Young Hot Snake.
4073260	4074260	Not Old Man Snake.
4074260	4075260	All right.
4075260	4076260	Fine.
4076260	4077260	Then I won't bid on it.
4077260	4078980	If you're not going to appreciate the things I do for you...
4078980	4083460	I'm not saying I wouldn't mind it, but now that it was, you know, if he had the camo
4083460	4085460	mask, that'd be awesome.
4085460	4086460	We'll figure something out.
4086460	4088580	I could put the Dr. Dick hat on him, the little orange hat here.
4088580	4092100	I don't even know if Justin TVers can see it because it's kind of blurry, but we could
4092100	4093540	give that to Solid Snake.
4093540	4094540	No.
4094540	4095540	All right.
4095540	4096540	Fine.
4096540	4102260	Well, there's something else that's sort of, uh, noteworthy as, um, rumors going around
4102260	4106420	that Sony was going to make any PS3 controller that would break into two parts so that you
4106420	4110060	could use, uh, use it, I guess, like a Wiimote.
4110060	4115420	Um, there was actually no real clear information given about it, but what it actually turns
4115420	4122740	out to be, um, like I said, rumor, is that it was supposed to be a controller that has
4122740	4125180	parts that will attach to it.
4125180	4130820	I guess, you know how the, um, 360s got the keyboard attachment on the controller and
4130820	4133660	the Mina mic and different stuff.
4133660	4135220	The little mini board.
4135220	4136220	Yeah.
4136220	4137220	Yeah.
4137220	4141900	But this is supposed to be just sort of like stuff that will merge with the controller
4141900	4145860	and Sony hasn't confirmed or denied too much about it.
4145860	4148540	It's like Voltron in controller form.
4148540	4152100	Do not associate Voltron with anything remotely Sony.
4152100	4153100	I'm sorry.
4153100	4154100	By the way.
4154100	4155100	Hail Jamie.
4155100	4156100	By the way, Rod.
4156100	4157100	What?
4157100	4158100	I thought that you might think this is funny.
4158100	4161300	I downloaded the entire, um, virtual, uh, vehicle Voltron series.
4161300	4162300	Nice.
4162300	4163300	Cause it was awesome.
4163300	4164300	All right.
4164300	4165300	All right.
4165300	4173620	Um, anyways, we've got some, uh, cool stuff coming out, uh, available for download content
4173620	4175820	this week for Rockband and Guitar Hero 3.
4175820	4181300	Uh, coming to Rockband, we've got Avenged Sevenfold, Offspring, and Crooked X.
4181300	4186460	Um, there's going to be a couple of songs here, Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, which
4186460	4192340	is going to be 160 Microsoft points or $2, uh, Critical Acclaim by Avenged Sevenfold
4192340	4199300	as well for 160 Microsoft points, also $2, and, uh, Hammerhead, um, by the Offspring
4199300	4206780	for 160 Microsoft points, also $2, and finally, uh, Rock and Roll Dream by Crooked X for 80
4206780	4209780	Microsoft points or a dollar.
4209780	4212420	So that's, uh, what you're getting for Rockband.
4212420	4219640	Uh, coming to Guitar Hero 3, Coldplay, and new singles and a couple more tracks coming
4219640	4224360	as well, um, including, there's going to be the Coldplay Track Pack.
4224360	4229940	It will contain Violet Hill, um, which is the first single from their, uh, Viva La Vida
4229940	4237340	album, uh, Yellow, and God Put a Smile on Your Face from the album A Rush of Blood to
4237340	4238340	the Head.
4238340	4241740	Somehow, I just don't think you could jam to The Scientist, so, you know, they kind
4241740	4243620	of had to put these other songs on there.
4243620	4244620	Yeah.
4244620	4245620	At least have some guitar in them.
4245620	4252100	That's going to bring you 500 Microsoft points, um, or $6.25 via the PlayStation Network.
4252100	4253100	Alright.
4253100	4255780	I might actually check, I like Coldplay.
4255780	4256940	They're pretty cool.
4256940	4260620	I don't know, I don't think of myself as rocking out to them on Guitar Hero, but that could
4260620	4261620	be interesting.
4261620	4265140	Coldplay's got some pretty guitar-heavy stuff.
4265140	4270620	I guess that's true, but maybe I think because my favorite Coldplay stuff is their more slowed-down
4270620	4274420	stuff, like The Scientist, Fix You, I like all those really, like, slow, whiny songs.
4274420	4275700	You know, that's what I like.
4275700	4277700	Well, my favorite one they did is Talk.
4277700	4278700	Alright.
4278700	4279700	Oh, that was a good song.
4279700	4280700	It was a really good song.
4280700	4281700	It was my favorite one by them.
4281700	4282700	Alright.
4282700	4283700	Hey, why isn't that in Guitar Hero?
4283700	4284700	That could be in Guitar Hero.
4284700	4285700	It should be.
4285700	4286700	Alright.
4286700	4288660	Well, maybe, maybe in Coldplay Pack 2.
4288660	4289660	Alright.
4289660	4292900	Um, Rock Band 2 is going to be featuring this band.
4292900	4296020	I have never heard of this band in my entire life.
4296020	4298220	Their name is Turbo, Turbo Negro?
4298220	4300260	Is that the name of them?
4300260	4301260	I don't even know.
4301260	4305500	This band, apparently, is going to be, I guess, is one of those cool, I mean, look at this
4305500	4306500	guy.
4306500	4311460	He's wearing, like, a ginormous fur, like, train, like a bride, like a bride would wear.
4311460	4313380	You know what impression I'm getting of them, Rob?
4313380	4314380	What?
4314380	4315380	Is, um.
4315380	4316380	The Village People.
4316380	4317380	The Village People, right.
4317380	4319380	You've got a sailor, and you've got, like, the bride.
4319380	4320380	I have never.
4320380	4321380	You have a pimp.
4321380	4323340	I have never heard of, God, I feel old.
4323340	4325140	I seriously have never heard of this band.
4325140	4326140	Like, I'm so out of touch with you.
4326140	4327140	Rob, don't feel bad.
4327140	4328140	Neither have I.
4328140	4329140	Alright, good.
4329140	4330140	However, I see bad religion, so.
4330140	4331860	Well, hold on, I'll get to that for a minute.
4331860	4332860	Sorry.
4332860	4333860	Alright.
4333860	4338140	Here's the thing is that when Age of Conan, you know, the big MMO, apparently, they put
4338140	4341960	out a press release here saying that, you know, because this band, I guess, is going
4341960	4343340	to be doing the Age of Conan soundtrack.
4343340	4344340	Well, guess what?
4344340	4351060	They're also going to be in Rock Band 2, and bad religion is also, supposedly, supposed
4351060	4354180	to be in the Rock Band sequel, even though Jamie gave that away, and I'm just kidding.
4354180	4355180	Sorry.
4355180	4358100	But it was in, it was, it was thanks to Twitter.
4358100	4363540	The guitarist and songwriter from bad religion, Brett Gurewitz, said in his Twitter, he posted
4363540	4368800	this twit, seven meetings and four executive decisions later, back at Sound City, putting
4368800	4372220	the finishing touches on Sorrow for Rock Band 2.
4372220	4375100	I'm surprised he was able to post that with Twitter being down as much as he can.
4375100	4376100	Are they Nordic Death Metal?
4376100	4377100	Are they?
4377100	4378740	They'd better be Nordic Death Metal.
4378740	4379740	That'd be awesome.
4379740	4381740	They are from Oslo, Norway.
4381740	4382740	Woohoo!
4382740	4385340	Also, let me see if I can find them on YouTube.
4385340	4387480	What's the song that's supposed to be in there?
4387480	4389620	It's Death, they're Death Punk rockers.
4389620	4390620	Sweet!
4390620	4392260	I'll try to find a clip.
4392260	4396100	And I totally agree with Acts Deaf, because bad religion's fucking awesome.
4396100	4400540	They did, like, one of my favorite songs ever is by bad religion.
4400540	4404220	Okay, here's a song called All of My Friends Are Dead.
4404220	4414220	All of my friends are dead, got kicked in the head, all my friends are dead, all my
4414220	4415220	friends are dead.
4415220	4416220	I'm gonna download this right now.
4416220	4417220	Jamie approves.
4417220	4418220	I'm downloading it.
4418220	4419220	Alright, there you go.
4419220	4422340	But bad religion does, did I Love My Computer?
4422340	4426660	That would work well with, like, a Grand Theft Auto IV video that I could possibly film.
4426660	4433500	Because we like playing this game during lunch where we put friendly fire off and then we
4433500	4436060	fire rockets at each other so we get rocket jumped.
4436060	4437500	It's kind of fun.
4437500	4441380	Xenocore says it's Nordic Punk, not Death Metal.
4441380	4443780	Here's that song by bad religion, by the way, in case you were wondering.
4443780	4458020	Now, thankfully, I have heard of bad religion.
4458020	4461380	Did they have an album called Apocalypse Dudes?
4461380	4463180	That's great.
4463180	4469900	By the way, Dragon Force supposedly has a new album out in August, so keep an eye out
4469900	4470900	for that.
4470900	4471900	Alright, there you go.
4471900	4476540	That's a rock band update, or the segment where the old hosts of OLR learn about new
4476540	4477940	bands that kids are into.
4477940	4478940	I just downloaded it.
4478940	4479940	Alright, cool.
4479940	4480940	That song that you played.
4480940	4481940	Alright.
4481940	4483820	And I Love My Computer is great, so shut up.
4483820	4484820	So anyway.
4484820	4486020	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
4486020	4487860	You downloaded that on your iPhone, didn't you?
4487860	4488860	Just now.
4488860	4492060	I have to ask, what did you think about the iPhone announcements on Monday, about the
4492060	4494580	new sleeker, cheaper one?
4494580	4496260	I don't care.
4496260	4504020	I don't, I didn't want a GPS, and I already have an 8 gigabyte iPhone, and I can just
4504020	4507260	update my OS on it, so I don't care.
4507260	4508260	I'm gonna get one.
4508260	4509260	I want one.
4509260	4513020	I mean, I already wanted an iPhone, and that just kinda upped the ante a little bit.
4513020	4515620	Here's the, and then, ah, I have to ask, kids.
4515620	4518620	Loki, what did you think of the iPhone announcements that happened on Monday?
4518620	4522620	I didn't really care, because it said, well, the slim thing, it's slim around the edges,
4522620	4525660	but it's actually thicker.
4525660	4529920	And apparently, it's gonna have that new finish on the outside, either white or black, which
4529920	4533840	is supposed to be really easy to scratch, instead of, you know, how they already had
4533840	4537520	it perfect, where you didn't, you know, it wouldn't scratch that easy.
4537520	4540020	And also, there's supposed to be a bunch of hidden fees.
4540020	4541020	Awesome!
4541020	4542720	Sounds like a phone for me.
4542720	4545140	Really expensive, and filled with fees.
4545140	4548340	See, that was the, that was the other thing, is that if they're gonna be cutting costs
4548340	4550660	in one way, they're gonna try to get it from you another way.
4550660	4554500	It's, they upped the price of the plan, is what they did, or something like that.
4554500	4559780	So I'm sitting here with my, you know, I paid $400 for my iPhone, sure, but this thing has
4559780	4565940	fucking lasted me, and it's fallen from my pocket, and landed on the floor, and lived.
4565940	4569980	Although it's been in its nice, sturdy case, I got for it, too.
4569980	4574380	And it enables me to listen to bullshit at work, because I can't watch it, but I put
4574380	4577740	my thing over it and listened to episodes of Penn & Teller's Bullshit.
4577740	4581820	And so I kept up with American Idol, and hi, David Cook won!
4581820	4587100	Alright, uh, Joshie16 comments on the last story, saying, you know Skye, cool kids listen
4587100	4589300	to Ashlee Simpson, so you should, too.
4589300	4593100	Huh, now look, I'm not that old, I know no one listens to Ashlee Simpson, okay?
4593100	4594700	I'll tell you what was cool with her.
4594700	4595700	What?
4595700	4597700	Her interview on the Charlotte Church show.
4597700	4599260	I've gotten to be where I like that show.
4599260	4603340	I still can't get over that Charlotte Church had like a hip talk show overseas.
4603340	4604780	It's funny!
4604780	4606820	I know, she's fucking Charlotte Church!
4606820	4607820	But she's hilarious!
4607820	4612260	She's the 11 year old girl that sang wah wah wah wah wah wah wah!
4612260	4616660	She's freaking hilarious, no you should watch the, okay, Rob Rob Rob, watch the, go on YouTube
4616660	4618140	later and watch the interview.
4618140	4619800	I've seen, I've seen clips of the Charlotte Church show.
4619800	4621780	Did you watch the interview with John Barrowman?
4621780	4622780	No.
4622780	4623780	Watch that!
4623780	4624780	Okay, I will.
4624780	4628700	It is seriously, it's seriously, you know, a boy and his hag.
4628700	4632360	I mean that's, that's the whole conversation.
4632360	4634180	The whole, that's their whole conversation.
4634180	4635180	Okay.
4635180	4636180	It's the best.
4636180	4637580	Is that show still, are they still producing it overnight?
4637580	4641980	No, she went on, she put it on hiatus after she had her baby, but was talking about bringing
4641980	4642980	it back up.
4642980	4643980	Huh.
4643980	4646020	Because apparently she had a blast doing it.
4646020	4647020	And um.
4647020	4648020	But I just, I can't get over that.
4648020	4649020	She had, what's your name, who did Big Brother?
4649020	4651020	That little sweet 11 year old girl singing opera.
4651020	4652020	Big Brother UK as well.
4652020	4653020	All right.
4653020	4654020	What was your name?
4654020	4655020	Davina?
4655020	4656020	Um.
4656020	4657020	Yeah, the host, Davina or whatever it is.
4657020	4658020	Yeah.
4658020	4659020	She was on there.
4659020	4660020	That was a really good interview too.
4660020	4661940	But, and the Ashley Simpson one was great, but the Gwen Stefani one was great.
4661940	4662940	All right.
4662940	4665960	And she wanted to get, um, I have to say this.
4665960	4668940	I was reading an interview where she wanted to get Paris Hilton on the show so she could
4668940	4669940	make fun of her.
4669940	4670940	All right.
4670940	4673340	So, oh, that'd be funny.
4673340	4674340	We've gone, let's see.
4674340	4675340	What have we talked about tonight?
4675340	4679460	We talked about D and D. We talked about international TV.
4679460	4683460	You know something is wrong with OLR when we're talking about Charlotte Church's life.
4683460	4684460	But her show's funny.
4684460	4685460	All right.
4685460	4686460	Talk about video games, Jamie.
4686460	4687460	Uh-uh.
4687460	4688460	Yes.
4688460	4689460	The agency.
4689460	4690460	Yes.
4690460	4691460	There we go.
4691460	4692460	Warmer.
4692460	4696420	It is not going to have the thing, the word that I hate that I will not use.
4696420	4701120	It is not going to have the arbitrary transactions that occur within the game that some people
4701120	4705100	have used the term micro as a prefix to.
4705100	4706100	How's that?
4706100	4707100	Micro machines.
4707100	4709540	Shut up.
4709540	4715260	They are not going to be using an arbitrary transition system within the agency.
4715260	4719840	They are actually going to have an in game currency that you will use like, um, a lot
4719840	4722700	of MMOs have, you know, in an auction house.
4722700	4726640	Oh, like a microtransaction.
4726640	4733160	You will not be using actual currency to purchase your money in game.
4733160	4738680	You will be using the in game currency that you use, much like buying your weapons in
4738680	4745580	Metal Gear Solid 4, which is not an arbitrary transaction because it's no money out of your
4745580	4746580	pocket.
4746580	4749580	The micro machine man here, aircraft carrier there, he can't have that, he can't have this.
4749580	4750580	He died.
4750580	4751580	The new micro machine aircraft carrier playset.
4751580	4753780	The dramatically detailed, terrifically trimmed replica of the real thing that holds 25 micro
4753780	4756140	machines with fabulous, fantastic features, two totally terrific elevators, real working
4756140	4757380	hoist runway and two cargo arms.
4757380	4758940	The new micro machine aircraft carrier playset from Galoob.
4758940	4761420	Remember, if it doesn't say micro machines, it's not the real thing.
4761420	4767100	It's because, you know, he figured out that, you know, in your life you can only say so
4767100	4773180	many words before you die and well, you know, he just blew through those really quick.
4773180	4774180	You are horrible.
4774180	4775560	You know what though?
4775560	4780460	He was actually, I very, very much like him though because he was also Blur in Transformers
4780460	4781460	the movie.
4781460	4782460	He was also the Scatman.
4782460	4783460	Wasn't that the same guy?
4783460	4784460	No.
4784460	4785460	No.
4785460	4786460	Oh.
4786460	4787460	I thought it was the same guy.
4787460	4788460	No.
4788460	4793660	I always thought Scatman and the micro machines guy were the same fucking guy.
4793660	4796060	However, Scatman Cruthers was Hong Kong Phooey.
4796060	4797060	Well they did both die.
4797060	4798060	I know.
4798060	4799060	That's sad.
4799060	4800060	It is sad.
4800060	4801060	Maybe Loki's on to something.
4801060	4802060	As I was saying.
4802060	4803060	Alright, sorry.
4803060	4808260	We're screwed too then.
4808260	4815420	The live gamer system is going to be used basically, you know, to set up like it is
4815420	4821100	in EverQuest 2 where they use a golden game as a transaction but they said that they were
4821100	4829460	planning on using an, I quote, alternate mechanics to use outside of in-game play for, like,
4829460	4834300	I guess for purchasing things that go along with it but not necessarily as an integral
4834300	4835300	part of the game play.
4835300	4840180	Like if you're going to call you on your cell phone and shit too in this game, like to tell
4840180	4847020	you, hey, Bub's, you know, been kidnapped, do you want to, you know, do you want to pay
4847020	4848020	the ransom?
4848020	4849020	No.
4849020	4851460	And you're like, fucking stop calling me at work.
4851460	4853700	I'm not playing you anymore.
4853700	4856140	I don't know.
4856140	4857140	Ah, technology.
4857140	4859140	God, I love it.
4859140	4860140	It's...
4860140	4861140	It's...
4861140	4862140	Speaking of technology though.
4862140	4863140	Whatever.
4863140	4864140	Not you.
4864140	4865140	Not you.
4865140	4866140	Rob.
4866140	4867140	Um...
4867140	4868140	What?
4868140	4874500	No, Rob just looks over here and he has this amused expression and I'm like, whatever.
4874500	4875500	Cause I'm funny.
4875500	4880980	You are a fun guy like a fungus, ho ho ho ho.
4880980	4881980	Next story.
4881980	4882980	Anyways.
4882980	4888860	So speaking of technology, Capcom is offering fans of the Street Fighter series to get their
4888860	4891220	face into the game.
4891220	4898940	And according to Capcom's Unity blog, they posted a call for fans to submit their story
4898940	4901760	and why they should be in Street Fighter IV.
4901760	4906700	You can send them anything from a new belly dancing telegram to, you know, something a
4906700	4907700	little bit more elaborate.
4907700	4911620	Just, you have to send it by June 18th.
4911620	4912620	And um...
4912620	4913620	Better get started.
4913620	4914620	Yes.
4914620	4923740	You email your submissions to contest at capcom dot com and along with your name, phone number,
4923740	4925020	age and email address.
4925020	4927060	Loki, are you going to get your face in Street Fighter IV?
4927060	4928060	I don't really care.
4928060	4929060	I think you should.
4929060	4930060	No.
4930060	4931460	Will someone else send in Loki's face?
4931460	4934460	Say it's theirs?
4934460	4936140	That's what I'd like to see happen.
4936140	4940540	Whenever these companies have these contests for get your face in the game, I want to see
4940540	4943420	people just send in Loki's picture.
4943420	4948780	I know which picture they'll send, and that's not going to work.
4948780	4951020	I don't think so.
4951020	4953740	I will sue them.
4953740	4955300	Here's another game I'd like to see Loki in.
4955300	4957220	It's Rose and Camellia.
4957220	4958460	Have you ever heard of this game?
4958460	4961540	Yes, it's the Slap-A-Woman game.
4961540	4964540	I don't know if you've seen this.
4964540	4967920	It's not domestic violence or any of that, you know, stuff that's not cool.
4967920	4974580	This is that old, like, you know, ladies in big, floofy dresses taking their white gloves
4974580	4977740	off and slapping the other woman in a dramatic soap opera fashion.
4977740	4980460	You might have remembered this game from a couple months ago.
4980460	4981460	There was a Flash game.
4981460	4982460	Well, guess what?
4982460	4986060	They also have it on the DS via homebrew, too.
4986060	4987060	That's awesome.
4987060	4991340	There is a brand new sequel to Rose and Camellia.
4991340	4993540	It's Rose and Camellia 2.
4993540	4997020	All new women to slap, all new stages.
4997020	5000420	It's just all the things you loved about the first game, but more.
5000420	5002500	By the way, I have to retract my statement.
5002500	5005140	John Maschida Jr. isn't dead.
5005140	5008260	Oh, the guy who did the microtransactions.
5008260	5010940	So you must have thought he was Skep Man John, too, subconsciously.
5010940	5011940	No, Skep McRothers.
5011940	5012940	Whatever.
5012940	5015400	There's someone else that, whatever.
5015400	5016980	That's right.
5016980	5018820	We were dead.
5018820	5019820	That's okay.
5019820	5020820	Sauron is great.
5020820	5023140	People report that celebrities are dead all the time.
5023140	5025540	Anyhow, here's the thing though.
5025540	5028260	You cannot just get the sequel that easy.
5028260	5036100	You have to actually beat the original Rose and Camellia to get the sequel.
5036100	5038880	But I don't think the first game was that hard, from what I remember.
5038880	5040380	But it's there.
5040380	5042560	All right.
5042560	5043560	Let's get to it.
5043560	5046420	Boys, part A has ran really long tonight, thanks to our last minute news.
5046420	5047420	That's all right.
5047420	5051060	We've talked about a lot of stuff, but we have to take a minute to respect our elders
5051060	5056420	a little bit and take a trip down the halls of gaming infamy in a little segment we call
5056420	5058460	the Classic Game of the Week.
5058460	5063220	Our very own Dark Sakura takes a look at the archives of games and finds something that
5063220	5064660	you all should be playing right now.
5064660	5067100	Dark Sakura, what is this week's Classic Game of the Week?
5067100	5071140	I went for obscure, as in obscure system.
5071140	5073660	It's a game that came out on the 32X.
5073660	5076220	Haven't done 32X games before?
5076220	5077980	I don't think we've had a 32X game yet.
5077980	5082020	I think I might have done, um, I haven't done Space Harrier, have I?
5082020	5083020	Not to my knowledge.
5083020	5084380	But I'm not doing Space Harrier today.
5084380	5087420	I am doing Knuckles Chaotix.
5087420	5090220	Knuckles Chaotix is cool.
5090220	5091860	Cue that beautiful bean footage.
5091860	5092860	I'm trying.
5092860	5093860	It's going to take me a minute.
5093860	5097420	The YouTubey is buffering, so tell us a little bit about Knuckles Chaotix.
5097420	5102580	Knuckles Chaotix in Japan was called just Chaotix, and it does feature Knuckles and
5102580	5109380	a bunch of his buddies, um, hanging out, um, on a, uh, different island, and Knuckles is,
5109380	5110380	whoa.
5110380	5111380	Sorry.
5111380	5112380	Anyway.
5112380	5117580	Um, but basically, you actually have different buddies that go along with you.
5117580	5121780	It's a, it's a buddy system game where you're joined by rings, and a band joins the rings
5121780	5122780	together.
5122780	5129620	So, like, say that you are using Knuckles as your main guy, then Knuckles will be able
5129620	5133220	to climb up walls and, and float across.
5133220	5140820	Um, you can actually use, um, I think that Espio does, like, some type of drill move
5140820	5145100	or something, but the whole point of the game is to use a buddy system to make it through
5145100	5147700	the five different worlds in the game.
5147700	5148700	They're called attractions.
5148700	5154140	And, you know, get to the end and, you know, kick, you know, Mecha Sonic's ass and tell
5154140	5156540	Eggman he can piss off.
5156540	5162300	Um, some of the characters in the game actually, um, did make it into Sonic Heroes, um, that
5162300	5171540	would be Espio, Vector, and, uh, Charmy, and, um, but every, but also the other thing about
5171540	5175940	this game is that it's one of the first to have, um, at least on the 32X, I think, that
5175940	5181580	had a battery backup on its own, um, which would save your game and you could go back
5181580	5190500	to it at any time, um, it's really just, and I'm sure you're watching the gameplay right
5190500	5191500	now, right?
5191500	5195460	Yeah, and to be honest, since I never had a 32X or a Sega Genesis, I mean, sure, I played
5195460	5199540	Sonic the Hedgehog at my friend's house, but I never really played this game, like, ever,
5199540	5204420	so, but it looks a lot like regular Sonic, but with a little bit of his buddy action
5204420	5205420	kind of going on.
5205420	5208980	Well, the other thing about that is that you do, um, you've also got your, uh, bonus stages
5208980	5212380	and special stages, um, your bonus stage, you collect 20 more rings by jumping through
5212380	5216500	large rings that are hidden in the level, um, you've got, uh, spiral free falls and
5216500	5223420	that sort of thing, um, and you also, uh, uh, have, uh, the special stages where you're
5223420	5230100	going through a, um, hexagonal, um, 3D course, and I think that the characters in this, I
5230100	5237900	do want to say, were, um, actually, um, rendered, um, in 3D for this game.
5237900	5241380	I do want to say that they were, don't quote me on that quite yet.
5241380	5249260	Um, also now, for the people who were into the really, really obscure, there was something
5249260	5255340	that came out on the Genesis emulators back in the day that was called Sonic Crackers.
5255340	5258540	Do you ever remember this, Rob?
5258540	5259940	Uh, no.
5259940	5265660	Sonic Crackers, um, which had also been titled the Sonic Stadium and Sonic the Hedgehog 4,
5265660	5271460	was a game featuring Sonic and Tails linked by rings, and the very interesting thing about
5271460	5279940	this is that it was pretty much officially called, um, a, uh, the prototype for Knuckles
5279940	5285140	Chaotix, um, proven by the fact that in one of the early Chaotix, um, builds, actually
5285140	5290040	the December 7th, 1994 build, the same sprites for Sonic and Tails were found, although my
5290040	5294260	personal theory is that Sonic and Tails were just used, because it's their Sonic 1 sprites,
5294260	5298460	were used for, um, developmental purposes, to, you know, to build the engine, and, you
5298460	5304080	know, there's, um, levels that actually cross over that have big similarities to levels
5304080	5309820	that were in, um, Chaotix, so, um, it's, it's very, very interesting, I mean, it's really,
5309820	5313900	you know, half the game, you get through with repeating levels and lots of deterioration
5313900	5321300	in the data, but, um, there's, uh, actually Amy, um, Amy Rose is in the sound test on
5321300	5325540	Knuckles Chaotix, and there's actually a way to, on certain copies of it, to, uh, switch
5325540	5330200	out, I don't remember which of the characters it is, but you can do a code that switches
5330200	5336980	out, um, one of the characters for Sonic, for that same, uh, sprite, um, and then there's
5336980	5343060	also, um, some of the level music in here, different versions of the same music was heard
5343060	5349720	in, um, uh, Sonic Crackers, also, um, one of the Chaotix builds was labeled as Sonic
5349720	5360260	Crackers 32X, so, alright, so we've had a, looks interesting, uh, it's one of those Sonic
5360260	5363780	games I never really got the chance to play, so hopefully it'll come out, I mean, I know,
5363780	5367180	um, game time's been adding 32X games, maybe it's on there and I just haven't noticed it,
5367180	5371340	it might be on there, I love these stages, alright, but this is a bonus stage we're looking
5371340	5376620	at right now, that's actually a special stage, the Hexagon 3D one, oh, cool, and, um, actually
5376620	5382540	it's something that you might think is cool is that, uh, the stage, um, set up for this
5382540	5389420	actually, um, made its way into Sonic Advance, something similar to this, um, I'm sorry,
5389420	5396340	the bonus stage one that made it into Sonic Advance. Alright, there you have it, Knuckles
5396340	5401460	Chaotix, your classic game of the week, check it out on the Sega 32X if you actually have
5401460	5408900	one. I have, like, two. Can you send one to one of our listeners? Um, I'll ask. Anyhow,
5408900	5412020	that's gonna do it for this part A of our Orange Lounge Radio, we've been running awfully
5412020	5414740	long here, almost like an hour and a half into it, so we're gonna take a break, we'll
5414740	5420760	be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live
