13786	18372	Tonight, June 15, 2008, does Nintendo think you are a geek?
18593	20736	How can you get your picture in Street Fighter IV?
21176	24181	And many new role-playing games get dated for the Xbox 360.
31920	32260	TechMasterLoki
56061	56581	How you doing, Loki?
56722	57322	I'm doing fine.
73354	74975	We've had some changes in studio.
75335	77035	I don't know if you can see it on Justin TV.
77055	87079	A lot of people are bitching on Justin TV because it's kind of blurry tonight because we just don't have the bandwidth right now to put out a really clear image and the way we have things hooked up as a crappy resolution.
87099	87899	Not revolution.
90140	91341	Yeah, JTV Revolution.
91461	92983	TV TV Revolution?
93003	93263	I don't know.
94024	95365	But it looks like complete crap.
95385	98408	But hopefully you can make out that Loki finally has a real chair.
98828	102031	It's this nice blue little fluffy chair thing going on.
102191	103993	It's the chair that Jamie used to have.
104413	105314	She has a couch now.
105334	107856	Yes, because now there is a couch over there.
108177	110819	Maybe I can show the people on Justin TV about the couch.
110979	111380	I don't know.
112040	116004	Maybe if you untangle yourself from the chair there.
118547	119308	Yeah, they can see that.
119568	120089	It's a couch.
122732	127058	Now I have to fix the camera, so we better start off tonight's show with a little bit of How was your gaming week, Loki?
128577	130018	I didn't play a whole lot this week.
130378	132899	I meant to, but I just got distracted.
133619	140061	I'm 100% complete now with Grand Theft Auto 4, so I've got the achievement and all that fun stuff.
140622	149925	Now, I finally got my video set up at home working, so I'm recording video now of gameplay, and I can do direct feed stuff now.
151380	152921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
167614	168375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
193038	202603	And what the evil swing set does is if you drive your car up to said evil swing set and leave it there for a second, it will fling you way into the air.
203123	203984	And it's hilarious.
205164	217211	So I was playing around with that most of the weekend and recording video and now I've edited it down and I'm trying to put something together coherent with it and hopefully we'll see a lot more of these things.
217911	221113	So we might actually have something on our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel.
221713	221953	Yes.
222013	223934	Because we haven't had anything on there in like two years.
223974	229678	I think the last thing that's on there is when you and Jamie were interviewed by the news station about Guitar Hero 1.
230458	230898	That's pretty old.
230918	232720	I think that's the last thing that's on there.
233060	233480	So good.
233520	234661	I'm glad to hear we have some updates.
234801	235241	That's awesome.
235981	243606	And I got a video camera too, so I'm hoping I can do some stuff as well, especially with Penny Arcade Expo around the corner, which I still need to book my flight for.
243646	245427	I've been a very bad boy, but I do plan on going.
245847	246368	So it'll be fun.
246608	247228	And BlizzCon.
247308	248569	BlizzCon's definite as well.
248849	257673	I did pick up Blastworks this week, and I actually meant to do stuff with it, but Nellie was playing Speed Racer a lot this week.
258413	260574	She really has found a game she loves, huh?
261095	270519	No, she's already bored of it, because she's gotten to a part now where it's so hard that she can't go any further, so she's kind of given up on it and going back to reading.
272039	277182	But, no, I actually have Blastworks, and I meant to do some really cool stuff with it, but...
278396	279457	Starfox ships in Blastworks
300103	301024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
323960	325700	So, definitely worth checking out.
325740	330241	Yeah, if you want to see that, just head on to our very archaic website at orangeloungeradio.com.
330441	331621	We were going to get a new website.
332061	332822	I don't know, someday.
332862	333882	We really need to look into that.
334342	346184	And go to our forums, and you're going to click on the OL Army clans, and you go to the Blastworks custom data thread, and let's see.
346264	347364	Okay, there's the Apollo Justice.
347604	348404	Oh, look at that.
348424	348864	That's cute.
349224	351425	The OLR billboard made by GS68.
351545	352205	That's pretty rad.
352745	354206	and some more ships there that he made.
354426	354906	I like that.
355666	356207	That's cool.
357467	358208	Yeah, it's one thing.
358248	366231	I think this game is going to catch a lot of people by surprise because there's so much you can make with it and there's that online community where you can share stuff, download other things.
366351	375015	So once you get done playing the game and unlocking the four other games in it, I mean, you can practically play all new games forever.
375655	376936	So it's pretty awesome.
378206	378446	Rob, Karazhan
395114	396916	So there was that, but I have been playing other games.
396956	400218	I checked out the demo for Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.
400578	409103	This is a game I've been pretty excited about because if you've listened to the show before, you know I love old school Civilization, like the very first one that was on the PCs back in the early 90s.
409744	413346	I love this game to bits, even as much as most console games.
413426	416648	I mean, it's probably my favorite PC game of all time, certainly.
417088	420831	So I wanted to see how it translated to console, and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed.
421851	422232	I think...
422952	427655	They took out a lot of micromanaging that made Civilization really complicated.
428016	438523	I mean, not to say it's bad, because playing Civilization Revolution, I also went back to go play Civilization IV, which I had skipped, because I wasn't all that big on Civilization III.
438643	440545	I was like, nothing's ever going to live up to the original.
440945	448226	I actually really enjoyed Civilization 4, even though there's more of that micromanaging and you actually have to kind of manage your settlers and all that going on there.
448747	459409	But in Civilization Revolution, they've really kind of, I think, I guess streamlined a lot of it to make it more accessible to a newbie and made it just feel more like a casual gaming experience.
459429	461189	I guess maybe that's what it is.
461949	464850	But I feel weird calling Civilization a casual game because it's really not.
464870	465290	But they made it...
466050	471233	I guess a little easier but I don't want to say they dumbed it down because Civilization is a very smart game.
471694	472234	You know what I mean?
474255	484162	I was going to say that I'm not really looking forward to Civilization but Red Alert 3 is going to be coming out later this year and that might be something I have to look at.
484402	485683	Is that something that's coming out on consoles?
485963	488865	Yes, on the Xbox 360 and I think PC.
489946	491327	So it'll be pretty awesome.
493088	493188	Um
493544	494465	Huge Red Alert fan, though.
494505	495145	I don't know, though.
495265	500348	I'm more of the PC Red Alert because I like cheating my ass off in that game.
500868	507872	Especially playing with the rules I&I files and stuff like that and adding the school bus of death and fun stuff like that.
508312	508532	Hmm.
509633	510013	Alright.
511586	512866	Let's see, other games I played this week.
512887	520109	Well, I guess there was just the Civilization 4, and then for some reason I had like a night of Atari 2600 gaming, thanks to GameTap.
520149	527831	I went back and played Kaboom, and went back and played Freeway, and all these just like crazy 2600 games that I remember from the past.
528351	530172	So, it was all good.
531052	531792	And that was really it.
531852	533073	Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
533113	535293	I don't even remember, what came out on Xbox Live Arcade this week?
536013	537514	Was this Commando this week?
538434	542555	I think I wanted to check that out, but I just never got around to that.
543356	545636	Alright, so DarkSakura is settling in.
545696	546717	She just got here.
547297	548597	I hate people.
548617	549558	Sorry, I hate people too.
550638	551918	I hate people that get in my way.
553699	555179	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
555199	555980	Did you have a good gaming week?
556440	559441	We bought Crystal Castles for the Atari 2600 today.
560761	566403	And Dragon something that's the Genesis equivalent of Devil's Crush.
567583	568884	Oh, I don't even know this game.
570324	571225	I forgot the name.
571325	573786	I'm kind of... I'm sure a chatter will think of it.
573826	575967	Chat.orange.com if you want to join in the fun.
575987	578268	And I finally found the one movie I've been looking for.
578288	584871	I've been finding it expensive, even used, and I was pissed off, but I finally found it for $10.
585231	585912	Okay, what's that?
586272	586832	Hypercube.
587892	588613	Oh, okay.
588633	589873	That's like Cube 3, right?
589913	590093	Cube 2.
590133	590214	Huh.
592267	594988	If you haven't seen it, you can come over and watch it with me because it's the awesome one.
595368	597248	I haven't seen Cube 2 or Cube 3.
597308	598289	I've seen the original Cube.
598549	600609	Cube would be a pretty badass video game, wouldn't it?
600669	603890	I have to tell you, someone has made a Hypercube mod for Half-Life.
605910	606490	Interesting.
606911	613412	I like Hypercube just because it has to do with weird physics.
614892	616913	Stuff that Carl Sagan talked about.
618052	622476	GameGuru in our chat at chat.orange.com says Keystone Capers for the win.
622656	624477	There's a lot of Atari 2600 left tonight.
624717	626579	What possessed you to go get Crystal Castles for the 2600?
627139	629982	We were at Dimple and it was there.
631543	632344	And so we bought it.
633224	633765	Well, alrighty.
634425	636327	And I almost bought Season 5 of Bullshit.
637113	638894	How far can you get in Crystal Castles?
667495	669695	is sitting in a chair using his feet.
669956	670656	That's pretty rad.
671736	675277	I have to say that is pretty amazing.
676557	677337	Stupid computer.
677737	682178	So we're always on the cutting edge of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio playing Atari 2600 games this week.
682218	683898	I cut plenty of edges of stuff.
685759	687379	Usually paper cuts on the manuals.
688019	693140	Oh yeah, we also had a good bit of Metal Gear Solid 4 being beaten twice over in my house.
693801	695041	Oh, that's what the other one was.
695141	695521	Frogger 2.
696941	697742	Oh, God.
698422	699783	I think probably better left forgotten.
699903	700263	I don't know.
700283	700583	I don't know.
700603	701544	The Frogger games weren't all bad.
701564	703345	But I want to hear about... The hell with Frogger.
703365	706347	I want to hear about Metal Gear Solid 4 because I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner.
706727	710729	I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf live because, you know, he's on live before us over at allgames.com.
711270	714251	And one of his callers called in to just rave about the game.
715292	717673	DarkSakura, I know you've been a Solid Snake fan for a while.
717693	718114	What do you think?
718294	719294	It was pretty epic.
719715	720355	Pretty epic.
720415	721896	And Dan hurt his fingers playing.
722376	724097	He actually got a cramp in his middle finger.
724898	725298	Wow.
725318	725378	Wow.
726581	728683	I was like, my man, hardcore gamer.
728743	730364	And I'm sure he's showing it off to everybody.
730584	731245	Look what I heard.
731465	732266	Look what I heard.
732426	732666	No.
733186	734467	He's been talking about it, though.
734688	739011	And I have to say, though, it's got like the longest fucking ending in the universe.
739812	743915	And it's also the biggest WTF ending in the universe, which I'm not going to say more than that.
744075	744315	Right.
744495	746017	But it has plenty of my man in it.
746557	748218	Because I'm like the only one that likes Raiden.
748519	748839	Oh, Raiden.
748859	748979	Raiden.
749804	776960	and on top of that it's a lot of Raiden kicking ass until he doesn't kick ass and that's not all I'm going to say about that but I have to say that I'm overall pleased with the project and give Kojima and team mad props for doing a good job I don't know if you can say this without spoiling so you can say I can't answer but does it leave the door open to Metal Gear Solid 5?
778388	779008	Actually, yes.
779549	780329	Okay.
780369	781730	Is there a dog ending?
782670	783791	That's Silent Hill, dummy.
783831	784371	It doesn't matter.
784391	785132	They can branch out.
787593	787873	All right.
788193	794837	But I do have to say that I was sitting in my little hole in the house, being the computer room.
795357	796398	You know what I'm talking about.
796578	796878	Right, yeah.
797038	798819	And all of a sudden, I hear the Snake Eater theme.
799380	800140	And I'm like, what?
802061	806404	And I just have to say that for fans of the older series...
807544	820368	You've got... There's major, major nods to the old Metal Gear series, and I'm not going to tell you what they are, but it's really, really... Fucking epic.
820388	823449	The way that they do it is really cool.
823729	831431	And I can't support this game in any way also, by the way, because Solid Snake in the game uses an Apple iPod.
832591	833292	Oh, shut up.
833312	834052	I don't think he...
835333	836754	No, there is an Apple iPod in there.
836774	837194	Just shut up.
837234	845077	I didn't remember seeing any of that going on in the game because they were too busy shooting stuff and talking about love on the battlefield.
846178	848039	Love is a battlefield.
849119	856122	No, it's been like this constant, you know, spiritual metaphor for... Do you know what would make Metal Gear Solid 4 better?
856743	857503	Snake not being old?
857523	858623	If it was a musical.
860444	863306	Okay, the whole... You know what my subtitle for this game has been?
863966	864146	What?
865132	872418	Metal Gear Solid 4, Damn Snake You Got Old Metal Gear Solid 4, Damn Snake You Got Old
889833	895379	Careful with putting that mic there because the fan... Our studio has been rearranged, I was telling the listeners earlier.
895419	896560	Now Jamie gets her own couch.
897001	899003	I'm waiting for her to kick her feet up one night.
900224	901085	It doesn't work there either.
901105	902387	You've got to put it next to you or something.
902727	903608	Where's the ferret?
903648	904329	Where's my baby?
905951	908874	Your ferret is used in our D&D game, so it's in the house.
908894	910235	You're playing D&D and not tell me?
912489	913269	You wanna come play?
913309	914269	I'm sure I can invite you.
914689	916030	We're like level 4.
916610	917250	Oh god.
917350	919510	I have a level 6 wereweasel.
920090	922051	50,000 nerd points with our listeners.
922311	923271	I'm the uber nerd now.
923291	924431	I have a level 6 wereweasel.
925171	925732	I'm a bard.
925952	926892	I'm a level 4 bard.
926912	927552	Spoonie bard?
928392	930352	I'm a sassy bard, not a spoonie bard.
930372	932353	My wereweasel has tasted of human before.
932813	937994	But the ferret, because somebody has a ferret familiar in the game, so we actually use the ferret as the ferret.
939226	941907	Do you remember Mel and Eric from the DDR days, right?
942127	942347	Yes.
942387	943567	That's who I D&D with.
944288	945588	The ferret is Mel's companion.
946408	948109	Well, I will talk to peeps.
948649	950210	Well, if it's on Tuesday, I can't do it.
950290	950810	It's not Tuesday.
950870	952030	It's like weekends usually.
952450	952710	Okay.
952890	953091	All right.
953411	953631	Cool.
954211	954451	All right.
955014	958577	Yeah, Valerno in chat is asking, who's breathing into their mic?
958597	961500	It's the fan thing, and I'm not going to do anything about it, so shut up.
961600	962361	It's the fan.
962741	967085	All she has to do is put her mic down, like not on the arm, but on the, yeah, just leave it in your cleavage.
967145	967565	It'll be fine.
967865	971108	Or put it, just put it below the arm so the fan's not blowing on it.
971168	971449	All right.
972729	979113	My face is above the arm line, so I need a shield over the mic.
979353	982755	Xenocore says, Sky, you better be playing version 4 or you're lame.
983415	985876	We started playing before 4 was out, because 4 just came out.
985916	986376	You know what?
986436	993280	Fuck everybody, because it's all about version 2.
993420	996762	Why you gotta bring Thacco into this?
997322	999503	Hell yeah, I can still calculate Thacco.
1000984	1001424	Alright, look.
1003564	1005285	We've really got to get back to video games.
1005365	1007746	I want to say another quick thing about Metal Gear Solid 4.
1008867	1010448	I just noticed this on Dig earlier today.
1010488	1014610	Apparently, GameSpot has given Metal Gear Solid 4 a 10 out of 10.
1014871	1016672	It's only the sixth game in history to do so.
1017432	1020274	Do you think this is a game that's deserving of all the praise?
1020294	1021314	What did Famitsu give it?
1021795	1022195	A 40.
1023516	1024556	Do you think it's deserving?
1024696	1026437	I trust Famitsu over GameStop.
1027618	1030340	Well, they also gave Nintendogs a 40, if I remember right.
1030400	1031460	Nintendogs was great.
1031800	1032541	For five minutes.
1033803	1035065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1048952	1051895	Um, Xenocore in chat says, fuck Thacco.
1052695	1056419	And, uh, Kikoman2DX says they apparently took bards out of four.
1056759	1058520	Dude, fuck 4th edition if that's the case.
1058700	1059561	Fuck it right in its ear.
1059581	1059962	No, no, no, no, no.
1060222	1063865	It's all about 2nd edition and playing a freaking, uh, uh, Bladesinger.
1064065	1064325	Alright.
1064746	1065826	It's all about it.
1066467	1067448	Enough D&D chat.
1067468	1070490	It's all about custom spells and the flesh-to-toast spell.
1071171	1071271	What?
1071852	1074634	No, no, the best spell ever, and I have to tell everybody about this.
1074754	1079917	My friend Derek, by the way, I know you're not listening, but congratulations for getting married last week.
1082278	1087502	He had a character named Blackstar who created a spell called Blackstar's Instant Chaos.
1088502	1095507	and so far I think we got to about five pages but it was supposed to be ten pages of a hundred effects so the spell would have a thousand effects.
1095867	1096308	Random.
1096888	1098369	We've had Jesus in our game before.
1098789	1100330	We've had golf umbrellas pop up.
1100771	1104213	We have had a Mortal Kombat machine land on a lich.
1106355	1108236	All sorts of funny things happen in this game.
1108556	1113500	And also one of my characters actually had a breast enlargement by accident because of the spell.
1114160	1115021	Can we talk video games now?
1115041	1116602	I just thought I'd share that.
1116882	1117863	The best spell ever.
1119266	1123049	I do like that, and I fully endorse that in any upcoming RPG.
1141496	1142097	Happy Father's Day!
1159525	1163606	Allgames.com was hacksword earlier this week, which kind of sucks.
1164406	1174749	I don't know why people keep hacking allgames.com because they are only doing good for the gaming community, but I guess some people want to hack it just because they can and like the challenge.
1175569	1180191	So folks are having to listen to us tonight directly through allgamesradio.com.
1180911	1187893	From what I hear, though, allgames.com is completely being redesigned, and there's going to be a complete new site in its place soon.
1188533	1191814	And I wish someone would do the same for OrangeLoungeRadio.com because damn, our old site's getting old.
1194054	1202837	Next week on the show, episode number 284 is the sixth anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.
1203537	1207358	A day early for all practical sake, but it's the closest day that falls to our anniversary.
1207818	1209858	The very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio was June 23rd, 2002.
1212679	1213440	Make a suggestion now!
1241189	1241729	DarkSakura.com
1270518	1270818	All right.
1273380	1273701	Let's see.
1273781	1276042	Ranma says, let Travis roast the hoats.
1276403	1277343	I don't know about that idea.
1277644	1278584	I don't know if I could take that.
1279645	1281707	As if he hasn't enough outside the show.
1282507	1285070	Misty says, but I know has any ideas.
1285610	1285930	Cry.
1286250	1286771	Make one.
1289073	1292257	All right, look, we got a lot of gaming news to get to tonight.
1292317	1294439	We have late-breaking news.
1295140	1303449	For all practical purposes, this was a slow news week up until about two, three hours ago when I think the roof just got blown off of something.
1303489	1304730	Now, granted, these are rumors.
1305111	1306152	Loki, what the hell's going on?
1306212	1306993	Update us on the latest.
1307053	1307954	This isn't even on our...
1308434	1308895	Intela Sponce
1322788	1323409	DarkSakura.com
1343422	1344202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1359989	1369193	But it says, avatars are digital personas available this holiday for all Xbox Live connected members and this spring for all new console owners.
1369794	1382260	Avatars will be used in place of the gamer picture you have today and give you a much more lifelike, animated, fully customizable persona for you to reflect who you are online.
1382280	1382920	We're getting these.
1384600	1388924	I would say these are a step up from Mii's, but essentially, yeah.
1389084	1390245	They're Mii's second mix.
1392267	1392827	That's what it is.
1393167	1393848	Mii Club Mix?
1394328	1394569	Yes.
1394909	1395409	Exactly.
1396770	1398472	Okay, so let's see here.
1399753	1399993	Guitar Hero 4
1418107	1419028	I'd say that's about right.
1419868	1423150	And some new information about the Guitar Hero 4 guitar.
1423310	1433597	It will be upgraded and will feature new touch sensitive neck which will allow you to do neck slides and opens up the entire guitar neck for unbound solos.
1434417	1435458	Shred how you want.
1436318	1438800	And then some of the artists that they mentioned for Guitar Hero 4.
1439220	1446785	Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, Interpol, Muse, and dozens more.
1448124	1449787	And let's see here.
1450128	1459143	Also, there is some information about... Remember a while ago, Lips appeared on a press site for some Microsoft announcement or whatever?
1459223	1459704	I do, yes.
1460895	1467461	Lips is a music and singing game that's going to include 30 songs and two wireless interactive microphones.
1467521	1473045	The ability to use and sing your own music or download songs from an online service.
1473365	1475667	It's designed to have fun with your friends.
1475707	1479531	Lips scores you on your singing, pitch, rhythm, and tune, and overall performance.
1479571	1483614	The wireless mics are interactive with lights on the shaft of the microphone.
1484074	1484695	Thanks for watching!
1502377	1510082	The game will reduce the vocals down so that you can sing along and be heard and score on whether you're in tune or not.
1510142	1513764	Lyrics can be added directly into the song to sing out loud.
1515525	1520308	There is a new Tony Hawk game that's going to be using a motion sensing device.
1520948	1524689	Board Controller on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1524990	1528671	In fact, I'm going to try to find this here real quick.
1528831	1531112	Comments from chat while you're looking for that.
1531472	1538634	GameGuru said, I don't know, but people are going to be pissed.
1538935	1542456	I mean, with all these news stories coming out, did E3 just get ruined?
1543619	1547581	A lot of their big, I think, big splashes may have gotten ruined a little bit.
1547922	1555106	With this whole... So, wait, we have Microsoft... Okay, they've taken the Miis and made it a little better with the whole avatars thing.
1555166	1555366	Yeah.
1555606	1563411	They've taken the whole Karaoke Revolution SingStar thing and made it a little better with this lips thing and this whole, like, you can put in any song, you get the vocals taken out.
1563431	1566593	That's like a big freaking deal, although it probably won't work perfectly.
1566933	1569334	That's still kind of a neat feature that the other games don't have.
1569735	1569975	I mean...
1570555	1576180	Anything you can do, I can do better I can do anything better than you Yes I can, yes I can Yes I can, yes I can Anything you can do
1598254	1599816	Thanks for watching!
1613809	1620871	Thanks to an intuitive board-based control scheme, it's never been easier to pull off amazing tricks and feel the sensation of skateboarding.
1621351	1624132	Shift your weight to turn and balance grinds.
1624192	1628733	Kick back on the tail of the board to ollie and lean into airs and pull off huge spins.
1628813	1637495	Feel the sensation of dropping the 60-foot mega ramp, bombing down the world's steepest streets, and watching Earth disappear behind your board as you launch out of a half-pipe.
1638356	1638796	Next gen...
1639696	1657632	graphics amplify the fun as you ride thrilling situations like these put down the controller step on the board and feel the sensation of going big and they say it's going to be $59.99 for the PS3 and Xbox 360 I'm guessing if it's going to come with a board it's not going to be that price anyways let's see here
1659534	1660955	Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii on your PC.
1660975	1665919	Many of these games are only available on consoles today and with this new feature you would now be able to
1681212	1683415	They will now be available on the PC as well.
1684677	1685698	This is with this feature.
1685818	1688021	Those console games are now playable on your PC.
1688341	1692246	Use the same game controllers as the original console systems.
1693067	1696672	All games use regular console controllers, not your computer, keyboard, or mouse.
1696772	1718466	Now, see, I read an interesting theory on that whole thread that was going on on NeoGAF where, you know, this whole thing exploded, that Trioxide was a possible codename for Xbox 360, because they saw some prices in here, $49 and $299, and people were speculating that maybe $49 is the new price of, like, the controllers, and $299 is this new system SKU that a lot of folks are speculating Microsoft's going to drop on us at E3.
1718767	1721528	Because I guess it's not uncommon for Xbox to use names of, like...
1722469	1725190	Chemicals, because I think helium was a codename of theirs once.
1725450	1729171	Well, trioxide, let's see, that would be... Ozone?
1730131	1731651	Yeah, O3, no?
1732171	1732431	Maybe?
1732631	1733812	Okay.
1734052	1735632	I think this is why... Yeah, that would be ozone.
1735752	1740773	I think this is why we're in this territory of, it's rumors, but slightly above it.
1740893	1743054	You know, like, there's gotta be some fact to this.
1743074	1746955	I mean, this company is legit... There's a lot of smoke coming from this.
1747195	1747415	Right.
1747715	1748135	But there's...
1749195	1757117	There's probably some red herrings amongst this because what these people did is they were basically sending out surveys, marketing research.
1757637	1771021	And that's how this whole thing got blown is that if you go to one of those websites, ran this whole avatars thing because somebody sent it to them confidentially from this website that they were being asked about this whole avatars thing on a research.
1771281	1773682	Well, then that link got taken and...
1774142	1777605	Some people blew it wide open and found all the other surveys that were out there, too.
1777665	1778685	That's how this whole thing started.
1778745	1784369	So, I mean, there's some legitimacy to this underneath, but there's still a lot being drafted, too.
1784670	1786171	Okay, let's see what else we've got here.
1787992	1789413	Scenic Pop Culture Edition.
1789633	1792415	Makes perfect sense that they've already come out with a scenic game.
1792435	1795918	The groundwork's already there, so I can see that happening.
1796058	1798299	Extreme Makeover Home Edition for the Wii and DS.
1798319	1798519	Yes.
1800215	1800896	I can see that too.
1801036	1802738	Gossip Girl for the Wii and DS.
1803018	1803318	What?
1804959	1807562	Ultimate Band for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.
1807802	1812526	That, if I remember correctly, Ultimate Band, I know for the Wii, is a Buena Vista game.
1813627	1814668	Or Disney Interactive.
1814768	1814948	Yes.
1815489	1818451	And it is a band game that does not use instruments.
1818711	1819972	And that's something that's already been announced.
1819992	1821814	You can play Hannah Montana songs to your heart's content.
1821834	1822535	I guess, yeah.
1823682	1831049	Wii Yoga, which I guess is supposed to follow along an inspirational yoga guru, instructor, matching machine, all these on-screen poses, stretches.
1831069	1832251	Wasn't there Yoga and Wii Fit?
1832411	1834713	Well, this is something else.
1835334	1837976	There's a lot of yoga games out there, trust me.
1838337	1839157	I've seen them.
1839197	1839818	I have to sell them.
1839858	1840198	It sucks.
1840979	1843181	They have some stuff on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, too.
1843721	1846443	A bunch of... Because this is a lot of Activision stuff on here.
1847764	1855329	In this new Marvel Ultimate Alliance action role-playing game, Civil War erupts, and the world's greatest heroes and villains must choose sides.
1855429	1864335	Select your side in the conflict and assemble your team of a roster of 20 Marvel Legends, including Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Venom, and the Human Torch.
1864935	1867337	Combine your team's power, blah, blah, blah.
1867557	1867917	It says...
1869514	1870475	Spider-Man vs. Marvel Zombies
1892731	1895032	The Marvel Zombies series is just crazy.
1895372	1895492	Wow.
1895512	1897593	I don't know if any of you have read any of them, but they're nuts.
1897713	1900915	And there was an Army of Darkness versus Marvel Zombies 2.
1901735	1905597	So there's going to be a set in the popular Marvel Zombies comic series.
1905637	1911860	You assume the role of Spider-Man and must save the world from zombie menaces that threaten to destroy it.
1912580	1916442	Play this adventure game in an open city, free-swinging environment in a war-torn Earth.
1916822	1920684	And the game takes place in the year 2149 in a warped version of Earth.
1921404	1921464	Um...
1922064	1929726	Fight against other Marvel heroes and villains who have already succumbed to the zombie horde, or become a zombie yourself.
1931427	1932247	So that's interesting.
1932487	1934468	I'm guessing that's probably coming out next year sometime.
1936028	1937149	Transformers 2.
1938509	1940870	Probably will suck, because the first one really sucked.
1941830	1944251	Obviously this is something that's way far away, but...
1945319	1946680	Spider-Man Game Using the Balance Board
1971841	1975623	It might be Spider-Man's heart that keeps him going, or maybe his strength.
1976083	1979684	Step into Spider-Man's shoes and decide for yourself.
1980305	1983166	One jump, leap, stomp, and kick at a time.
1983286	1989009	Climb atop your Wii Fit board to control Spider-Man's acrobatic abilities like never before.
1989549	1993430	Lean one way or the other to send Spider-Man's story into the air.
1993971	1998853	Jump as high as you can to propel Spider-Man off of Manhattan's tallest rooftops.
1999173	2002215	I don't see how you could do that because they don't want you jumping on the Wii balance board.
2003636	2004376	It'll be interesting.
2005577	2005977	That's true.
2007478	2008139	Let's see here.
2008579	2012201	TigerClaw says the sequel is going to be called Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen.
2012702	2013202	From our chat room.
2015035	2016337	Call of Duty 5, Forza 3, Cars and Tracks
2038200	2054756	Key features of Forza 3 include highly detailed real world cars and track models, over 400 cars and 100 tracks, near limitless customization options for cartooning and custom artwork, a variety of online community features, highly accurate racing simulation,
2055336	2060998	including real-world damage, new race modes, drag, drift, oval, point-to-point racing, etc.
2061578	2065520	A powerful assist system to help new players get into the game quickly.
2066900	2068081	And... what else?
2068141	2074683	But all that is subject to change, obviously, because he probably thinks... Yeah, this is all stuff that's going on right now, and it says also imagine that...
2075403	2076024	Thank you for watching!
2096807	2100851	Extra service space for photos and videos and a free month of live.
2101391	2106636	And the collector's edition will also include exclusive motorsports content not found anywhere else.
2107257	2111380	And it says this can be anything from authentic racing gear, gloves, helmets, etc.
2111400	2115524	It's especially created automobile and manufactured gear, branded jackets, etc.
2115584	2117666	to VIP motorsport event tickets.
2118307	2122650	See, that sounds kind of cool, but this stuff is so early that it's probably just...
2124446	2128027	What they want to do, and they're also kind of getting people's opinions on this stuff.
2128987	2134429	And if you dig even deeper in that NeoGAF thread, people kept finding more stuff on that site.
2134749	2142751	Like, I don't know, I didn't read into how the security hole was opened or whatever, but... It basically, well, I saw it earlier before they took everything down.
2142871	2143551	Oh, it's fixed now?
2144012	2145292	Because, yeah, it is fixed now.
2145392	2148593	There's some other stuff that was on there, too, including there's a game for...
2150846	2153587	It was called Crucible that they had a video for.
2154527	2159408	Animal Planet Emergency Vet was a game that was on there, you know, like the show on Animal Planet.
2160228	2162368	Bill Nye Science Lab on the Wii.
2163028	2165369	No joke, Bill Nye the Science Guy finally gets a Wii game.
2166329	2167849	That was like one of our dream games, wasn't it?
2167909	2168249	I don't know.
2168709	2169210	And then get this.
2169850	2171450	You Don't Know Jack on the Wii.
2172130	2172610	Finally.
2173470	2174731	Finally this game's coming back.
2174851	2175331	Thank God.
2175611	2176891	I know two other games that haven't been...
2178228	2180430	Hell's Kitchen The Price is Right Wii and DS
2200073	2201655	You just can't play Plinko at home.
2201695	2202355	It's not the same.
2202636	2203096	You know what I mean?
2203116	2204337	It's just not the same.
2204678	2205058	I don't know.
2206039	2206279	All right.
2206719	2208781	They had a Price is Right game on Commodore 64, didn't they?
2208801	2210203	Years ago?
2210283	2211544	They had some pretty old ones.
2212625	2218090	I was seeing some other stuff on here too, and I'm sure a lot of people now are starting to make up stuff to go along with this.
2218110	2219111	But...
2223123	2224103	Thanks for watching!
2246833	2247794	It is very interesting.
2247874	2251236	It sounds like they do have a lot of stuff up their sleeves.
2251636	2254358	And they said they had a few aces still up their sleeves for stuff.
2254558	2257380	Well, ace avatar, I don't know.
2258001	2260683	SG100Matt says in chat, Price is right for the Wii.
2261003	2263205	Itagaki better do it so he get the bouncy titties.
2264626	2267087	Because you know that's why people watch the Price is Right.
2267107	2267708	Oh my god.
2267848	2268849	Come on down!
2268909	2270390	Bonga bonga bonga bonga.
2270430	2271731	Too bad it's all grandma's.
2274378	2285382	Like we were saying back last week, how Itagari would do, how I appear he would do a press event or kicking over stuff, setting things on fire, that kind of thing.
2286083	2287583	That would apply to Price is Right, too.
2287603	2288624	I think that would be pretty awesome.
2288704	2289104	That would be.
2289144	2290785	We're making a Price is Right game, bitch!
2291636	2291896	All right.
2293737	2294897	Definitely lots more to come.
2294997	2297999	That story, of course, all still in development, was very new.
2298719	2300180	We'll see how this develops throughout the week.
2300280	2306282	Meanwhile, let's get into the news we were going to talk about anyway tonight, even though that took like 20 minutes to cover, but that's pretty big.
2306963	2310144	Let's quickly run through some of the other week's news and let you guys comment.
2310664	2311004	All right.
2311224	2313065	Ossifer says, Microsoft's comment.
2313525	2314586	Fuck, you didn't just hear that.
2318980	2329589	Um, Nintendo is suing Nyko over the Comma Wireless Nunchuck, which doesn't really make much sense to me when I think about it because, you know, people put out third-party accessories all the time.
2330049	2335774	I guess Nintendo's just really super anal about people putting out, you know, third-party remotes and nunchucks.
2336094	2340838	Because actually, if you think about it, I remember Mad Catz was putting out a third-party remote that kind of looked like
2341298	2344439	A dildo, but actually that's never come out yet.
2344999	2349400	So I'm wondering if these people are just getting blocked by Nintendo for this stuff.
2349500	2362104	But either way, they are suing them because apparently it appropriates the novel shape, design, overall appearance, and even the color and materials used in the Nintendo Nunchuck controller.
2362944	2369966	Except it's also wireless, but apparently it's similar enough and people are thinking, hey, maybe Nintendo's making their own wireless Nunchuck.
2370902	2373504	I doubt that, but... I don't know.
2373944	2374624	It still sucks.
2375005	2380268	So, if you're looking to buy a wireless nunchuck, do it now, before they're pulled from shelves.
2380288	2382569	Do you think this has any merit on Nintendo's part?
2383029	2386551	It's just weird, because there's tons of third-party controllers out there.
2386592	2387292	Why this one?
2387612	2388833	It's true that, you know...
2389333	2395156	They have... It has merit, but at the same time, though, I thought that this stuff has to be approved through Nintendo first.
2395216	2399757	Like, you know, before they make these peripherals, they have to approve it with Nintendo.
2400078	2403139	I mean, because the same could be said with these, like, you know, the Wii Zapper.
2403219	2408461	I mean, there's a bunch of things that came out before the Wii Zapper that were pretty much exactly the same as the Wii Zapper.
2409041	2415124	And some things, in fact, you know, Naiko even made a better, you know, peripheral than the Wii Zapper for gun games, but...
2416508	2418029	Thanks for watching!
2440458	2445922	They should have been some sort of process where they have to get approval from Nintendo to put out these products.
2446422	2447222	Or, I don't know.
2448503	2449864	Usually that's the way it works, I thought.
2452186	2453687	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
2453887	2457969	If they get the pants sued off of them or what will happen.
2458390	2460711	But do you think Nintendo just wants to put out a wireless thing of their own?
2460931	2461532	Is that what's going on?
2461952	2462332	I don't know.
2463153	2465294	Jamie, what do you think of this whole lawsuit stuff?
2466595	2469897	I think it's just Nintendo trying to keep the market under their control.
2470970	2476918	Well, Nintendo did this this week, and it's not Nintendo as a company, but one person at Nintendo.
2476978	2481084	But when you hire a person like this as your marketing director, he's speaking on behalf of your company.
2481624	2483226	And this guy pissed me off this week.
2483266	2484007	I don't know about you guys.
2484829	2485249	This was...
2486090	2487351	and Edge Magazine.
2487692	2499502	And Nintendo of Europe marketing director, Laurent Fischer, was talking about the whole... He got, of course, as most Nintendo people have, got kind of put on the spot lately while he was talking about WiiWare games.
2499942	2501624	Where is the extra storage?
2502945	2507129	What about all these people that are filling up their Wii consoles with all this stuff?
2507189	2508290	Where is the extra storage?
2508690	2510371	Well, according to Laurent Fischer...
2511374	2515197	Only geeks and otaku want the issue addressed.
2515658	2517979	Here's the actual quote from the magazine here.
2518280	2521402	You can read their little site online at next-gen.biz.
2521702	2531170	When a question about the limited Wii system memory was raised, Nintendo's Laurent Fischer slipped into talking about how geeks and otaku were the only people who would want this issue addressed.
2532071	2533872	Yeah, that would be their entire fan base.
2535894	2536134	Duck.
2538021	2540382	Then he went and tried to backtrack a little later.
2540422	2541983	He was talking to Video Gaming 24-7.
2542023	2546464	He didn't mean to offend anyone and it's all a misunderstanding.
2547625	2548125	You know what?
2548585	2556188	I don't know how much more cut and dried that could be or how that could be misconstrued to mean anything else.
2556328	2566352	Geek and otaku, first of all, apart from being slightly synonymous except with otaku having a slight bigger social stigma overseas, is still...
2569190	2571531	Your freaking marketing director?
2572332	2574133	You want to appeal to these people.
2574153	2584559	Well, I know Nintendo was trying to get the broader audience and trying to get the moms and grandmoms into it, but still, their core fan base is the nerdy gamer.
2584579	2584899	Sorry.
2585748	2607458	and here's the problem, this particular geek has spent lots of money on these virtual console downloads downloading the same shit I played years ago when I could be playing them for free on the internet but no, I decided to support Nintendo I decided to download these games and actually pay the price for them so I could have the official emulator and support the people behind it and this is how we get thanked?
2607959	2612321	I downloaded ZSNES I know, that's what I'm saying, I could have done that
2613061	2615403	and I could have never supported the whole virtual console thing.
2615663	2619947	I would have the space on my drive to do more WiiWare games and I wouldn't have to worry about any of this.
2621788	2623029	No.
2623209	2625251	And this is the thanks we get for supporting Nintendo.
2625291	2625871	You're a geek.
2627152	2627833	So you know what?
2628874	2630095	Fuck you.
2631249	2634430	I am not downloading anything else on Virtual Console.
2634510	2635190	I don't give a shit.
2635230	2637871	They could put Guardian Legend out on it tomorrow.
2637991	2638751	I'm not getting it.
2638851	2641412	I will play it on NES emulators.
2641452	2642492	Thank you very much and be happy.
2643053	2645133	I will not download any more WiiWare titles.
2645593	2650435	I will not support Nintendo's download service until A, this guy is...
2651388	2657212	LetGo, or shifted into another position where he's not speaking on behalf of the company, or B, Nintendo addresses this issue.
2658033	2658393	That's it.
2658753	2675805	Personally, I'm not going to suffer because of one idiot, but, you know, I still... I think that it would probably be a bit more... I would have to say... Well, first of all, they're not going to know that you're doing this if you just do it, and they're not going to listen to our podcast.
2675845	2676505	I know.
2677206	2680087	I'm hoping maybe some of the listeners will...
2681192	2682294	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2695359	2701762	So why not put together some type of organized effort to address it?
2702262	2712647	It's one thing to say we're going to do this on the show, but another thing to actually send a letter to Nintendo, to the CEO US, to the ones in the UK.
2712687	2718350	So are you saying I should start some type of blog where I encourage people to send letters and join me in this boycott?
2719150	2719531	Why not?
2719711	2720911	Alright, I'll do it tomorrow.
2721412	2722112	Alright, we're doing it.
2723672	2724052	We are?
2725012	2725472	I'm doing it.
2725553	2725793	Okay.
2726533	2727213	And you're signing it.
2727233	2728073	Hey, I'm fine with it.
2728493	2733034	I haven't really been downloading anything from Nintendo's WiiWare service anyways.
2733155	2735635	My download service actually isn't working, but I did want Pokemon Snap.
2735655	2743497	That's the thing, is I've been trying to support Nintendo, and that's why, you know, you might just think, Rob, get over it, but it's one of these things where, like, dude, this is the marketing director.
2744077	2745238	This is what he's going to say.
2745258	2746598	Isn't that Marketing Director UK?
2747498	2748138	It doesn't matter.
2748719	2749979	But I'm saying, you know...
2751947	2765095	The letters have to go to him, to whoever his boss is in Nintendo UK, to over here, and probably even to the overall head officer.
2765395	2765696	No, I won't.
2765716	2768597	I can go download it on an emulator and I guess I'll be just fine.
2768617	2768837	Just fine.
2781075	2781815	So there you have it.
2782496	2783736	Let's see, what does GameGuru say?
2784036	2786577	Nintendo will fix the issue for Animal Crossing at E3.
2786677	2788518	If they don't, I will join this boycott.
2789458	2800402	GameGuru, I actually think my boycott will be over by E3 because I think, like I said, I will un-boycott when they address this issue finally and stop pretending it doesn't exist.
2802943	2806224	And if it doesn't get addressed, then it just justifies the boycott even more.
2807580	2809267	So, bleh.
2809388	2811255	One thing is you've got to get enough people to
2813018	2813578	to participate.
2814218	2816079	ShadowTri says, oh, now you go back on it.
2816119	2816439	No, I'm not.
2816479	2820561	I said the boycott will be over when A, this guy gets let go or B, Nintendo addresses the issue.
2820901	2824743	And it's widely anticipated that Nintendo will address the issue at E3 with some type of storage device.
2825223	2830725	But I don't think they're going to come out at E3 and say, hey, just for geeks and otakus, this new storage device.
2830745	2838768	Well, that's still fucking lame anyways because your average anybody that's using the Wii console needs a storage space because they didn't think it through very well.
2838788	2840949	They were trying to cut costs to make this thing very
2841249	2844712	Why are you bragging that there's a hundred... I'm sorry, this isn't you, this isn't Nintendo.
2844732	2852318	Why are you bragging that there's a hundred plus different games you can download on virtual console when your stupid thing won't even hold more than twenty?
2853490	2861136	Well, one other thing, though, that I would like to say is that Nintendo does have a track record for creating the demand for something.
2862497	2866660	And then when people are worked up enough about it, they'll release the product.
2867100	2878769	So I would not be at all surprised if they didn't have something like this already in mind, that they put out this massive amount of downloadable content, stuff that's going to fill up all this space.
2879409	2880890	And then when people are like, what do we do?
2880930	2881431	What do we do?
2882071	2884352	Nintendo comes to save the day with a storage unit.
2884472	2885493	You know, something like that.
2886093	2889335	Hitstun says, somebody called you a geek and you're going to boycott over it.
2889735	2890976	Sort of, yeah.
2891296	2892937	It was meant in a derogatory fashion.
2893217	2900060	Yes, because it was meant in a derogatory fashion and if we've been supporting the company for all these years and this is the thanks we get, then I'm not going to support it anymore.
2900861	2901881	That's the issue.
2902962	2906924	Online plays for Geeks in a Tacos.
2907624	2908224	I don't know, a...
2909702	2910822	Avatars are for geeks and tacos.
2910842	2913163	Non-friend codes are for geeks and tacos.
2914044	2914904	Geeks and tacos?
2915364	2916184	No, otakus.
2916324	2917405	Let's get tacos.
2917425	2922547	If he said download things were for tacos, I would be, yeah, tacos are rad.
2922647	2928949	Okay, I'm going to give a GameStop gift certificate to anyone who comes over here and brings us chicken soft tacos.
2931330	2932010	I'm serious.
2932070	2933130	Nobody knows where we live.
2933711	2934231	Some people do.
2934251	2934651	Where I live.
2934751	2935011	All right.
2936397	2937939	Look, I'm done with my rant.
2937959	2939100	I'm sure we'll get emails on it.
2939140	2940121	Let's go on to the next story.
2941642	2942784	Oh yeah, we have that, don't we?
2943224	2943404	Yes.
2943945	2954816	Well, for people who are going to be downloading this stuff, who may or may not be participating, but only in the UK, we have five new games out on Virtual Console.
2954876	2959180	We have Alex Kidd Miracle World, which is a good, good game.
2961019	2963621	and that is actually going to be 500 Wii Points.
2964722	2978973	There is Last Ninja and Nebulas for Commodore 64 and both of those are 500 Wii Points and then for Neo Geo we have Ninja Combat and Fatal Fury 2 and those are going to be 900 Wii Points.
2981647	2982247	Guess what, Rob?
2982927	2988009	You can actually come over to my house and play Fatal Fury 2 on my Neo Geo.
2988189	2988609	I'll do that.
2988709	2989069	Do you want to?
2989249	2989409	Yeah.
2989549	2989789	Okay.
2989869	2993690	Because I think those Neo Geo cartridges have more storage than a Nintendo Wii.
2993710	2994810	512 megabytes.
2995371	3001032	Yeah, there's the same amount of storage in one of those fucking carts than there is in the Nintendo Wii.
3001072	3001552	Same amount.
3001572	3004333	I want to say that, yeah, they're 512 a piece.
3006021	3011468	I'm sorry, but flash memory is not that expensive, and I don't understand why they couldn't have added more to this.
3012649	3016654	I think seeing as the device will already read a USB thing...
3018182	3020103	or will copy to your SD card.
3020904	3023405	I don't see... They could do it with a freaking patch.
3023705	3028208	They could patch the system to temporarily load things off your SD card into the flash memory.
3028228	3029649	I don't know why they're worried about piracy.
3029669	3030329	It's just stupid.
3030589	3032570	People are already pirating.
3032750	3033471	Yeah, exactly.
3033531	3034872	People already know how to do it.
3034952	3036052	It's not going to matter anymore.
3037013	3038273	So, oh well.
3041218	3047240	In other news, unrelated to Nintendo, Famitsu Magazine.
3047360	3057123	They're definitely one of the most popular game magazines in Japan, and if you want to get your grubby little hands on a subscription, it's going to cost you quite a bit of money.
3057583	3064725	However, NCSX is offering import subscriptions to Famitsu Magazine, ranging anywhere in Japan.
3065745	3066826	I hope you have the money for this.
3067186	3073730	Anywhere from $480 a year to $2,860 a year.
3073750	3079694	$480 per year for 52 issues, because it is a weekly magazine.
3079874	3082176	Considering they're being shipped from Japan, that's actually not that bad.
3082196	3082356	Exactly.
3082376	3083657	You can also do the same thing through Yahoo.
3083677	3084497	I thought I'd let you know.
3084597	3085458	Yeah, for media mail.
3085478	3086038	I mean, Amazon.
3086739	3088760	And UPS overnight shipping would be $2,860.
3088820	3091882	Because it's overnight shipping.
3092042	3093183	Priority mail is only $626, so...
3095273	3101817	You can do the same thing through Amazon and have been able to for a long time because I had, for a little while, a subscription to the Doctor Who magazine.
3102818	3103078	Nerd.
3104419	3105660	Geek, otaku.
3106321	3106941	Whatever, Rob.
3107081	3109002	I said it big fat, so what about that?
3109223	3111084	This is nothing new.
3111804	3115487	They're just doing the same thing that you've been able to do for Amazon for ages and ages.
3117488	3118669	Nothing wrong with a little competition.
3118789	3120971	I could go to Kinokuniya and buy them every week, too.
3121051	3121351	Yeah.
3125783	3126524	All right.
3126804	3130868	But there is something, you know, overnighting it to your door that is kind of neat.
3130988	3131869	A week later.
3132089	3132269	Huh?
3132569	3133090	A week later.
3134852	3139396	And every so often, Kinokuniya will clear them out, you know, a couple weeks after that for half price.
3139756	3140537	Well, hopefully something...
3140837	3143578	Something coming to your door soon will be Mega Man 9.
3145358	3153401	If this is to be believed, Capcom apparently has recently registered Mega Man 9 under Australia's version of the ESRB.
3153461	3157322	That would be the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the OFLC.
3158002	3161043	Apparently the game is going to be multi-platform.
3161683	3168626	So that could be pretty interesting, especially when you consider a couple weeks ago, didn't Capcom say something about reviving one of their dead franchises?
3168946	3169766	Or there was going to be a couple?
3170455	3172597	Mega Man 9 Mega Man 8 Mega Man 9
3190037	3191037	You know what I want to see?
3191298	3191498	Huh?
3191898	3199721	I want to see a redo of Mega Man 2 with the higher-end graphics, I think.
3200641	3201802	As long as it plays the same way.
3201842	3204503	Well, there was sort of that thing on GameCube, the anniversary condition.
3204743	3205123	Yeah, but...
3205894	3207295	I want shiny.
3208336	3212698	Here's what I would like to see the Mega Man, you know, otaku geek in me would like to see.
3213058	3222184	I would like to see them kind of do that, like what you're saying, but have the first like three Mega Man games all combined where you could go into the different stages.
3222644	3228388	Like, let's say you could go play in Bubble Man stage and then go to Top Man stage and then the Cuts Man stage.
3228408	3230169	You know, you could kind of like all of them combined.
3230189	3231990	We need a new Rockman Power Battles.
3233291	3234072	That would be kind of cool.
3234092	3234913	That would be hot.
3235253	3237476	AJ Mix calls it Mega Man 2 HD Remix.
3238577	3239078	Why not?
3239238	3240900	Put it on Xbox 360.
3240940	3241381	Exactly.
3241421	3241861	Why not?
3242542	3243183	Sounds like fun.
3245025	3245406	Alright.
3246227	3246667	You know what?
3247068	3251032	We should download extra stuff on Xbox 360 and include that in our letter.
3251795	3253376	I already download a lot on Xbox 360.
3254076	3255997	That's really nothing new.
3256297	3261380	I have that thing set to automatically download all demos, which was a pretty brilliant idea.
3261700	3263981	But Xbox can do that because the hard drives are huge.
3264001	3264682	They're 20 gigs.
3266202	3269344	And if you need more space, there is a 120 gig hard drive available.
3269384	3269964	Exactly.
3270044	3271625	That 20 gigs has been more than enough.
3271645	3273226	And if you're industrious.
3273386	3275467	Especially after I deleted Final Fantasy XI.
3275887	3277048	It's been more than enough space.
3277728	3280911	I don't really watch movies on it, but if I did, I could go get that $120.
3281411	3285835	Or, you know, you can put stuff on USB, memory card, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
3287736	3291519	Actdeft calls it kind of like the Sonic 2 HD version some guys are doing.
3292400	3292920	Yeah, kind of.
3293301	3296623	Alpha Canogram says, Sky, Mega Man Anniversary Collection for GameCube sucks.
3296703	3297384	Oh, yeah, I forgot.
3297424	3299746	There's the whole GameCube versus PS2.
3299786	3303529	Even though the GameCube had the remix music, it screwed with the buttons and all of that.
3303609	3304890	Well, all right, fine, whatever.
3305110	3305630	You know what I meant.
3306618	3307758	I'm still excited about Mega Man 9.
3307878	3311380	Well, that is actually pretty cool.
3311880	3326085	But for people who like their video games turned into movies, like me, as long as they're not fucked up, there is some news about Onimusha and Clock Tower movies.
3326165	3332067	And actually, the Clock Tower movie still has Christoph Gans still attached to it, so that's pretty cool.
3332267	3334668	That's cool, because I like Silent Hill.
3334928	3335608	I, for one, liked it.
3336226	3345513	And that one's got a... I think actually that and Onimusha are set to come out in 2011.
3347555	3349216	Actually, no, I take that back.
3349256	3355361	Onimusha will be out in 2011 and Clock Tower will be out next year.
3356322	3356883	Possibly.
3358644	3359965	But it better not suck.
3360806	3361586	Go camp out now.
3361706	3362867	You know what, Rob?
3363047	3363248	What?
3363648	3364809	We need a Fatal Frame movie.
3367918	3369799	I still want to see the Silent Hill 2 movie get made.
3370120	3371000	Yes, I know!
3371380	3372961	It better not suck.
3374102	3374382	Are they?
3374562	3374943	I thought.
3374963	3375483	I don't know.
3375843	3376404	That'd be cool.
3377444	3377745	We'll see.
3380266	3386150	So we've got a lot of stuff coming out this week in game releases in the US on PC.
3386831	3388792	Political Machines 2008.
3389152	3394756	Yes, you too can now take part of your own I don't know political election.
3396752	3408140	Also this week we've got the Spore Creature Creator for PC if you want to have a little piece of Spore to play until the actual game comes out.
3408320	3410982	Although apparently if you know where to look you can already get it.
3411102	3411763	That's the demo.
3411783	3412863	And I hear it's quite good.
3413284	3414244	That's the demo.
3415305	3416846	Still, I hear it's quite good.
3417427	3419268	I haven't played it myself, but I hear it's good.
3420431	3446700	Also this week, Space Invaders Extreme on the PSP and DS Definitely worth checking out Finally, Imagine Rockstar on the DS Not quite as cool as Imagine Babies, but whatever Imagine Babies is still in my backpack Special in its own way Wacky Races, Crash and Dash Yes, that's based off of that really old cartoon series Does anyone still remember it?
3446880	3447920	I don't know No
3449035	3465287	Code Lyoko, Fall of Izana Secret Agent Clank on the PSP Ubisoft's whoring yet another Pets franchise Pets Dogs Fashion That's right, dogs dressed up like things.
3466048	3466688	Interesting.
3467909	3468409	But not.
3470010	3471832	Stop anthropomorphizing our animals.
3472912	3474093	Arkanoid on the DS.
3474814	3475414	That's pretty cool.
3475775	3477096	Tamagotchi Connection Corner 3
3480703	3483384	Rock Band Special Edition Guitar Hero On Tour Game Releases
3500127	3502608	Not too much more upbeat over in Japan either.
3502648	3504529	It's kind of a slow period for release dates in Japan.
3504569	3510491	But on the Xbox 360 on June 19th, you can pick up Flat Out Ultimate Carnage if you want to get that.
3511231	3513192	Because their releases tend to be on Fridays.
3514893	3519355	Over on the PlayStation 3, not a lot coming out this week.
3519455	3520535	Stay tuned for next week.
3521095	3524997	On the Nintendo Wii, you can pick up Puyo Puyo, which has now been reduced in price.
3526561	3531445	Super Mario Stadium Family Baseball Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian Harukanaru Jikunokade 4
3541693	3544774	Taking a look at the PS2 for those of you that still love that.
3545914	3550235	Another version of Harukanaro Chiku no Kare comes out on the PlayStation 2.
3550896	3555437	Also, Love Drops and Odin Sphere get moved into the best, meaning they get price drops.
3556037	3558498	And Sora Yume also comes out.
3559341	3587777	On the Playstation 2 Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS We have Nippon Shuzan Renmei Kanshu Itsudemo Soroban DS Comes out Also another version of Puyo Puyo Since I've been doing this for a long time now It's getting slowly better Just remember everything is either A, I, U, A, O Okay, I'm trying Spectral Force Genesis Comes out on the Nintendo DS And Watashi no Pony
3588857	3589677	MyPony!
3616892	3620115	I'm thinking that's a game they need to release over here a little quicker.
3620535	3621616	I think it is out over here, though.
3622177	3626080	On the Sony PSP, God of War, Chains of Olympus comes out in Chinese.
3626781	3628762	It's localized for Chinese, so that's coming out this week.
3628782	3632125	That's not Japan, but Asia in general comes out of there.
3632726	3638591	Also coming out on the Sony PSP, Secret Agent Clank, Super Robot Taisen, a portable.
3638971	3639371	Sweet.
3641193	3642434	There aren't enough Super Robot Wars.
3643635	3644396	That's really it.
3644857	3648943	Also, the headset and remote come out for the PSP this week in Japan.
3649484	3649864	There you have it.
3650305	3653910	I want the one of those that has the Ava's in it.
3654891	3656454	The robot Tyson.
3656474	3658056	I think it was one of the Saturn ones.
3659048	3659408	Very cool.
3659428	3660049	Is it my turn?
3660429	3660929	It is your turn.
3660969	3662590	We has games over in the UK.
3662950	3663390	Lots of them.
3663490	3664271	Well, a few of them.
3664591	3665511	But on lots of systems.
3666152	3670514	We have Alone in the Dark for Wii, PS2, PC, and Xbox 360.
3671514	3673795	Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 on PSP.
3674436	3675176	About Time.
3675897	3677157	Gauntlet on DS.
3677778	3678418	I like Gauntlet.
3678898	3685221	The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian on PSP, Xbox 360, DS, PS2, Wii, PC, PS3.
3685782	3688023	And Top Spin on Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.
3689966	3692106	Not to be confused with that really cool car show, Top Gear.
3694087	3702789	I'm looking at Justin TV chat right now, which I don't usually watch during the show, but I know we have some people who can only watch on Justin TV because, for whatever reason, the other ways to listen to this are banned.
3702849	3708030	Ikuma JP, who actually lives in Japan, pays me a compliment and says, I understand Sky's Japanese now.
3708390	3709890	That is quite the compliment, actually.
3710170	3710870	Never had a lesson.
3711270	3718432	I was just saying, it really is, I guess with practice, you know, and I have noticed you picking up a little vocabulary.
3719491	3719791	A little.
3720011	3720311	A little.
3721031	3721312	A little.
3722312	3722992	Rob's picking up stuff.
3723012	3724472	Pretty soon I'm going to start answering my phone.
3724512	3724972	Mushy, mushy.
3725373	3725633	All right.
3727173	3728994	Also, AkumaJP brings up that whole difference.
3729074	3730854	Is Mega Man the same thing as Rockman?
3730914	3731154	Yes.
3731574	3733575	Rockman is what it is in Japan and Europe.
3733975	3735995	I don't know why they called it Mega Man here.
3736035	3741537	I'm thinking that maybe they thought if they called the game Rockman, people would have thought it was like a rock band or rock music.
3741557	3743057	I don't know.
3743097	3745238	The girl assistant was Roll.
3746707	3748669	I know, rock and roll.
3749469	3756035	Maybe is it because Guts Man was kind of a rock character and they didn't want people to think he was a bad guy?
3756135	3757276	I don't know.
3757997	3759618	Because people don't get it.
3761100	3761560	It's weird.
3761600	3764383	They did have a lot of those changes back in the day.
3765259	3765679	Random.
3765799	3768961	And the really ugly cover that Mega Man 2 had.
3769681	3770362	Oh my god.
3771062	3773923	This is when Capcom was like, let's Americanize all of the art.
3773963	3775344	That was a pretty awesome cover.
3775764	3780667	The only, I think, good one that was done was one of the Metal Gear ones that looked like it had Michael Biehn on it.
3781907	3783148	I was like, dude, Terminator.
3783604	3786268	Akuma, you've got to check that out if you've never seen it.
3786348	3790513	Go to Google Art and search for the Mega Man 2 box art because it's pretty epic.
3790634	3794238	In fact, if you live overseas and you've never seen it, it's pretty hilarious.
3794399	3795160	Prepare to weep.
3795901	3797863	It's hideous.
3798404	3799565	All right, let's get back to some gaming news.
3829167	3830428	Oh, they're so close.
3830588	3831429	They're so close.
3831529	3831929	Warmer.
3832169	3832750	Getting warmer.
3833490	3833951	So close.
3833971	3834451	You're warm.
3834471	3838614	I don't know what the other one is, but we know what one of them is.
3840416	3841977	Bionic Commando Rearmed.
3843678	3848602	But I guess considering that E3 is coming out mid-July, it'd probably be out before then.
3850043	3853386	And Halo Wars was there, but Alan Wake was not.
3856227	3878674	and the list is still very incomplete right now so there's you know no Atari, Codemasters, Crave, Disney, Eidos, Konami, LucasArts, MTV, Nintendo, Sega, Sony Online, Square Enix, Take-Two, Tecmo, THQ, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers Interactive so that's a big uh gap right there a big list but um
3881099	3887103	I'm sorry, I'm reading in chat about the whole Rockman vs. Mega Man thing, and GameGuru is saying Rocks is slang for crack.
3887863	3890425	So maybe that's why they didn't want to release it here.
3890445	3892366	Because people would have thought it was Crackman.
3892386	3896409	Although, I don't know, if you release a game called Crackman, I think it might actually sell pretty well.
3897398	3898239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3919040	3923803	Did you know that Pac-Man overseas is called Puck-Man?
3924263	3924683	Yes, I did.
3924703	3925484	P-U-C-K-Man.
3925764	3927405	And you know why they didn't release that here?
3927805	3935229	Because they were afraid that people were going to take their magic markers and color over the P with an F. I swear to God, I read it on Wikipedia, therefore it's true.
3937030	3937250	Rob.
3937590	3937771	What?
3938211	3939492	Rob.
3939532	3939712	What?
3940632	3941172	Next story.
3941673	3941973	All right.
3943584	3944225	Sure, we can do that.
3944705	3946747	And I don't know, Jamie, this might be of interest to you.
3946787	3949910	Have you ever wanted to have a life-size Solid Snake statue?
3949930	3952993	Uh... Hey?
3954318	3954718	Why not?
3955719	3957420	Shit, we ought to get one of these for the studio.
3957440	3958641	That would be kind of rad, actually.
3958661	3959942	It's a fucking auction.
3960362	3961343	Alright, well here's the thing.
3961503	3967448	What Sam's Club is doing, Sam's Club is actually selling a life-size statue of the old snake.
3967968	3970630	And it's being sold starting this upcoming week.
3971350	3973912	Unfortunately, it's not something you can actually go into the store and buy.
3974693	3975654	It's being auctioned.
3976394	4003070	and it's actually in a Walmart blog that originally announced this called Checkout I had no idea there were blogs about Walmart you learn new things every day you can find it on auctions.samsclub.com and if you search for Metal Gear Solid you can find the stand-up which I would love to have one of here in studio but somehow I don't think that's going to happen I'm going to guess that's probably going to go for a lot of money
4004667	4006007	There's only one thing I've ever won.
4006087	4007668	Is the money going to charity or anything?
4007788	4008468	I'm sure it will be.
4008788	4011309	There's only one thing I've ever won from a charity auction.
4011329	4013849	I tried to search for it and it says sold out.
4014650	4016430	So what's up with that?
4016510	4018411	Maybe it doesn't start until Monday or something.
4020011	4023492	I've won one thing off of a charity auction for gaming related stuff.
4023612	4023892	Really?
4024272	4025452	True Crime New York City.
4025512	4028233	I have a poster signed by the entire cast.
4029614	4031034	It's at work though, framed.
4031960	4032601	True Crime, New York City
4046567	4046847	I don't know.
4047107	4049048	I bought it, and it was cool.
4049328	4052549	It was the poster that they had, the little teaser poster, before they announced that it was New York City.
4053089	4055130	You were supposed to guess, you know, what city it was.
4055550	4056550	Ah, right, right, yeah.
4056910	4063233	Apparently this auction is not up until next week, but I'll tell you what, if it's a reasonable price, I might go put a bid on it.
4063593	4063953	We'll see.
4064453	4065994	But I'll probably get outbid pretty quick.
4067074	4067674	I think it'll be fun.
4067694	4070275	Wouldn't you like to have Solid Snake sitting in the corner of the studio?
4070535	4071855	Maybe Young Hot Snake.
4073196	4074196	Not Old Man Snake.
4074476	4075817	All right, fine, then I won't bid on it.
4076513	4084836	If you're not going to appreciate the things I do for you... I'm not saying I wouldn't mind it, but now if it was, you know, if he had the camo mask, that'd be awesome.
4085456	4086136	We'll figure something out.
4086156	4087517	I could put the Dr. Dick hat on him.
4087657	4088517	The little orange hat here.
4088777	4093058	I don't even know if Justin TVers can see it because it's kind of blurry, but we could give that to Solid Snake.
4094339	4094479	No.
4094659	4095179	Alright, fine.
4096448	4124380	well something else that's sort of noteworthy is rumors going around that Sony was going to make an EPS3 controller that would break into two parts so that you could use it I guess like a Wiimote there was actually no real clear information given about it but what it actually turns out to be like I said rumor is that it was supposed to be a controller that has parts that will attach to it
4125260	4126521	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4153599	4153980	By the way, Rob.
4154000	4154541	Hail Jamie.
4154821	4155342	By the way, Rob.
4155462	4155662	What?
4156043	4157364	I thought that you might think this is funny.
4157404	4160949	I downloaded the entire Vehicle Voltron series.
4161390	4161630	Nice.
4161870	4162792	Because it was awesome!
4164694	4165095	Alright.
4166597	4166997	Alright.
4167718	4167878	Um...
4168894	4170935	AVENGED SEVENFOLD, OFFSPRING, CROOKED X

4238412	4240853	Somehow I just don't think you could jam to The Scientist.
4241013	4243473	So, you know, they kind of had to put these other songs on there.
4243693	4244053	Yeah.
4244233	4245294	At least have some guitar in them.
4245514	4251455	That's going to bring you 500 Microsoft points or $6.25 via the PlayStation Network.
4252616	4252976	All right.
4254036	4254776	I might actually check.
4254796	4255676	I like Coldplay.
4255736	4256337	They're pretty cool.
4257077	4257557	I don't know.
4257597	4261298	I don't think of myself as rocking out to them on Guitar Hero, but that could be interesting.
4262388	4265369	Coldplay's got some pretty guitar-heavy stuff.
4265389	4268169	I guess that's true, but maybe I think... Some fairly melodious guitar, I'd have to say.
4268209	4272410	My favorite Coldplay stuff is their more slowed-down stuff, like The Scientist, Fix You.
4272490	4274511	I like all those really slow, whiny songs.
4274871	4275431	That's what I like.
4275871	4277211	Well, my favorite one they did is Talk.
4277492	4277772	All right.
4278632	4279452	Oh, that was a good song.
4279632	4280252	It was a really good song.
4280272	4281072	It was my favorite one by them.
4281272	4281532	All right.
4282413	4283533	Hey, why isn't that in Guitar Hero?
4283553	4284413	That could be in Guitar Hero.
4284853	4285233	It should be.
4285253	4286294	All right.
4286314	4287554	Well, maybe in Coldplay Pack 2.
4289005	4292908	Alright, Rock Band 2 is going to be featuring this band.
4293008	4295389	I have never heard of this band in my entire life.
4295910	4298331	Their name is Turbo Negro?
4298691	4299412	Is that the name of them?
4300393	4301053	I don't even know.
4301153	4305756	This band apparently is going to be... I guess it's one of those cool... I mean, look at this guy.
4305796	4308618	He's wearing like a ginormous fur, like, train.
4308918	4310760	Like a bride would wear.
4310780	4313121	You know what impression I'm getting of them, Rob?
4313181	4313421	What?
4313802	4313902	Is...
4314522	4315183	The Village People.
4315203	4316144	The Village People, right.
4316184	4319387	You've got a sailor and you've got like the bride.
4319467	4320568	I have never... You have the pimp.
4320929	4322651	I have never heard... God, I feel old.
4323451	4325033	I seriously have never heard of this band.
4325073	4326194	Like, I'm so out of touch with youth.
4326214	4326735	Rob, don't feel bad.
4326755	4327736	Neither have I. All right, good.
4327796	4329558	However, I see bad religion, so...
4329898	4330538	All right, well, hold on.
4330578	4331459	I'll get to that for a minute.
4332279	4343403	All right, here's the thing is that when Age of Conan, you know, the big MMO, apparently they put out a press release here saying that, you know, because this band, I guess, is going to be doing the Age of Conan soundtrack.
4343423	4343864	Well, guess what?
4343884	4345564	They're also going to be in Rock Band 2.
4347865	4353547	And Bad Religion is also supposedly supposed to be in the Rock Band sequel, even though Jamie gave that away.
4353788	4354188	Sorry!
4354568	4355268	But it was thanks to Twitter.
4358086	4364132	The guitarist and songwriter from Bad Religion, Brett Gurewitz, said in his Twitter, he posted this twit.
4364792	4371158	Seven meetings and four executive decisions later, back at Sound City, putting the finishing touches on Sorrow for Rock Band 2.
4372320	4376063	I'm surprised he was able to post that with Twitter being down as much as it's down.
4377044	4377364	Are they?
4377444	4378646	They better be Nordic death metal.
4378666	4379506	That'd be awesome.
4379626	4381508	They are from Oslo, Norway.
4381608	4382029	Woohoo!
4383669	4384870	All of my friends are dead All of my friends are dead
4413797	4414938	I'm gonna download this right now.
4415819	4416459	Jamie approves.
4417000	4417680	I'm downloading it.
4417841	4418561	Alright, there you go.
4419082	4421784	But Bad Religion does... Did I Love My Computer?
4422305	4426088	That would work well with like a Grand Theft Auto 4 video that I could possibly film.
4429010	4435916	Because we like playing this game during lunch where we put friendly fire off and then we fire rockets at each other so we get rocket jumped.
4436557	4437057	It's kind of fun.
4437618	4439740	Xenocor says it's Nordic Punk, not death metal.
4441298	4443839	Here's that song by Bad Religion, by the way, in case you were wondering.
4456103	4458144	Now, thankfully, I have heard of Bad Religion.
4458424	4460304	They have an album called Apocalypse Dudes.
4461245	4461825	That's great.
4464274	4468816	By the way, Dragonforce supposedly has a new album out in August.
4469316	4470276	So keep an eye out for that.
4470356	4471477	Alright, there you go.
4471557	4472637	Your rock band update.
4473438	4477839	Or the segment where the old hosts of OLR learn about new bands that kids are into.
4478019	4478879	I just downloaded it.
4479340	4480140	That song that you played.
4481240	4482881	I love my computer is great, so shut up.
4483741	4484321	So, anyway.
4484982	4485662	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
4485942	4487643	You downloaded that on your iPhone, didn't you?
4487744	4488024	Just now.
4488244	4493287	I have to ask, what did you think about the iPhone announcements on Monday about the new sleeker, cheaper one?
4494685	4495385	I don't care.
4496365	4498346	I don't... I didn't want a GPS.
4499306	4502487	And I already have an 8GB iPhone.
4503427	4505587	And I can just update my OS on it.
4505807	4507188	So, I don't care.
4507308	4507968	I'm gonna get one.
4508308	4508768	I want one.
4509108	4512429	I mean, I already wanted an iPhone, and that just kind of upped the ante a little bit.
4513209	4515209	Here's the... And then... I have to ask kids.
4515629	4518310	Loki, what did you think of the iPhone announcements that happened on Monday?
4518730	4523571	I didn't really care, because it said, well, the slim thing, it's slim around the edges, but it's actually thicker.
4525553	4539553	and apparently it's going to have that new finish on the outside either white or black which is supposed to be really easy to scratch instead of how they already had it perfect where it wouldn't scratch that easy and also there's supposed to be a bunch of hidden fees
4540490	4540991	Awesome!
4541071	4542192	Sounds like a phone for me.
4542592	4544994	Really expensive and filled with fees.
4545154	4550339	See, that was the other thing, is that if they're going to be cutting costs in one way, they're going to try to get it from you another way.
4551039	4552821	They upped the price of the plan, is what they did.
4553261	4554102	Or something like that.
4554482	4565252	So, I'm sitting here with my, you know, I paid $400 for my iPhone, sure, but this thing has fucking lasted me, and it's fallen from my pocket and landed on the floor and lived.
4566253	4567233	and I'll see you next time.
4582247	4582467	All right.
4583488	4588952	Joshi16 comments on the last story saying, You know, Sky, cool kids listen to Ashley Simpson, so you should too.
4589753	4590914	Now look, I'm not that old.
4591034	4593075	I know no one listens to Ashley Simpson, okay?
4593155	4594236	I'll tell you what was cool with her.
4594416	4594596	What?
4595277	4597218	Her interview on the Charlotte Church show.
4597739	4599280	I've gotten to be where I like that show.
4599320	4603483	I still can't get over that Charlotte Church had like a hip talk show overseas.
4603503	4604604	It was funny.
4604944	4605284	I know.
4605464	4607086	She's fucking Charlotte Church.
4607326	4608066	But she's hilarious.
4608086	4609988	She's the 11-year-old girl that's saying, What?
4611449	4612770	She's freaking hilarious.
4612850	4614470	No, you should watch the... Okay, Rob, Rob, Rob.
4614911	4618193	Watch the... Go on YouTube later and watch the interview.
4618253	4619834	I've seen clips of the Charlotte Church show.
4619854	4621254	Did you watch the interview with John Barrowman?
4621955	4622175	No.
4622575	4623316	Watch that.
4623496	4624536	Okay, I will.
4625157	4628519	It's seriously, you know, a boy and his hag.
4628799	4630660	I mean, that's the whole conversation.
4632741	4634042	That's their whole conversation.
4634730	4636134	Okay.
4636234	4637378	Is that show still producing?
4637779	4642592	She put it on hiatus after she had her baby, but was talking about bringing it back up.
4643237	4648341	I was reading an interview where she wanted to get Paris Hilton on the show so she could make fun of her.
4648361	4648521	Alright.
4648541	4649622	So, I thought that'd be funny.
4673223	4675104	We've gone, let's see, what have we talked about tonight?
4675124	4677546	We talked about D&D, we talked about international TV.
4679428	4682490	You know something is wrong with OLR when we're talking about Charlotte Church's life.
4683371	4685032	But her show's funny.
4685052	4686513	All right, talk about video games, Jamie.
4687254	4687654	Uh-uh.
4687854	4688094	Yes.
4688455	4689095	The Agency.
4689675	4691097	Yes, there we go, warmer.
4691597	4695100	It's not going to have the thing, the word that I hate, that I will not use.
4696403	4704330	It is not going to have the arbitrary transactions that occur within the game that some people have used the term micro as a prefix to.
4705030	4705450	How's that?
4705991	4706671	Micro machines?
4707612	4707933	Shut up.
4709514	4714438	They are not going to be using an arbitrary transition system within the agency.
4715239	4722625	They are actually going to have an in-game currency that you will use like a lot of MMOs have in an auction house.
4722925	4724106	Oh, like a microtransaction.
4726604	4730906	You will not be using actual currency to purchase your money in-game.
4733107	4735629	You will be using the in-game currency that you use.
4736669	4739831	Much like buying your weapons in Metal Gear Solid 4.
4742312	4745974	Which is not an arbitrary transaction because it's no money out of your pocket.
4746806	4747106	He died.
4747126	4750229	It's because he figured out that in your life, you can only say so many words before you die.
4750249	4750490	And well...
4770871	4772932	You know, he just blew through those real quick.
4773112	4774012	You are horrible.
4774252	4774832	You know what, though?
4775552	4780754	He was actually, I very, very much like him, though, because he was also Blur in Transformers, the movie.
4780854	4785275	He was also the Scatman.
4785315	4786036	Wasn't that the same guy?
4786256	4786356	No.
4786456	4786636	No.
4787096	4788336	Oh, I thought it was the same guy.
4788576	4788696	No.
4790677	4793578	I always thought Scatman and the Microchips guy were the same fucking guy.
4793598	4795238	However, Scatman Crothers was Hong Kong Philly.
4795979	4796899	Well, they did both die.
4797423	4798144	I know, that's sad.
4798164	4798846	It is sad.
4799487	4800729	Maybe Loki's on to something.
4802051	4803574	As I was saying... Alright, sorry.
4804095	4805718	We're screwed too then.
4808257	4835255	the live gamer system is going to be used basically to set up like it is in EverQuest 2 where they use Golden Game as a transaction but they said that they were planning on using alternate mechanics to use outside of in-game play I guess for purchasing things that go along with it but not necessarily as an integral part of the gameplay
4835609	4846353	Like, if you're gonna call you on your cell phone and shit, too, in this game, like, tell you, hey, Bob's, you know, been kidnapped, do you want to, you know, Do you give a shit?
4846513	4847853	Do you want to pay the ransom?
4848073	4848273	No.
4848353	4850374	And you're like, fucking stop calling me at work!
4851674	4853035	I'm not playing you anymore!
4853055	4854996	I don't know.
4856296	4857136	Ah, technology.
4857456	4858057	Gotta love it.
4860517	4862858	Speaking of technology, though, Whatever.
4863278	4864659	Not you, not you, Bob.
4865059	4865199	Um,
4866570	4866750	What?
4867671	4873417	No, Rob just looks over here and he has this amused expression and I'm like, whatever.
4874258	4875059	Because I'm funny.
4876841	4878683	You're a fun guy like a fungus.
4880706	4881346	Next story.
4881587	4890272	Anyways, so speaking of technology, Capcom is offering fans of the Street Fighter series to get their face into the game.
4891073	4901140	And according to Capcom's Unity blog, they posted a call for fans to submit their story and why they should be in Street Fighter 4.
4901720	4907664	You can send them anything from a new belly dancing telegram to something a little bit more elaborate.
4907924	4909605	Just you have to send it by June 18th.
4912268	4913108	Better get started.
4913389	4913649	Yes.
4914430	4925080	And you email your submissions to contest at capcom.com along with your name, phone number, age, and email address.
4925260	4927002	Loki, are you going to get your face in Street Fighter 4?
4927222	4927763	I don't really care.
4927803	4928343	I think you should.
4929144	4929304	No.
4929464	4930866	Will someone else send in Loki's face?
4931426	4931987	Say it's theirs?
4934232	4935433	That's what I'd like to see happen.
4936073	4942056	Whenever these companies have these contests for Get Your Face in the Game, I want to see people just send in Loki's picture.
4943557	4946558	I know which picture they'll send, and that's not going to work.
4948899	4949860	I don't think so.
4951140	4951981	I will sue them.
4953683	4955364	Here's another game I'd like to see Loki in.
4955424	4957045	It's Rose and Camellia.
4957165	4958346	Have you ever heard of this game?
4958786	4959807	Yes, it's the slapping game.
4959827	4961508	Yes, it's the slap a woman game.
4961568	4964150	I don't know if you've seen this.
4964470	4967492	It's not domestic violence or any of that stuff that's not cool.
4967852	4977439	This is that old ladies in big floofy dresses taking their white gloves off and slapping the other woman in a dramatic soap opera fashion.
4977719	4980400	You might have remembered this game from a couple months ago.
4980441	4981201	There was a Flash game.
4981401	4982102	Well, guess what?
4982782	4986004	They also have it on the DS via homebrew too, Jamie.
4986024	4986484	That's awesome.
4986804	4991247	There is a brand new sequel to Rose and Camellia.
4991307	4992388	It's Rose and Camellia 2.
4993468	4994609	All new women to slap.
4995129	4996070	All new stages.
4996530	4999752	It's just all the things you loved about the first game, but more.
5000412	5001873	By the way, I have to retract my statement.
5002053	5002173	What?
5002453	5003194	John Machida Jr.
5003234	5003594	isn't dead.
5006176	5007536	Oh, the guy who did the Microchips?
5008257	5010858	So you must have thought he was Scatman John 2 subconsciously.
5011018	5011859	No, that's Scatman Crothers.
5012794	5014375	Alright, whatever.
5015315	5015655	That's right.
5018696	5020317	That's okay.
5020477	5022358	People report that celebrities are dead all the time.
5023078	5025219	Anyhow, here's the thing though.
5025559	5028020	You cannot just get the sequel that easy.
5028260	5033862	You have to actually beat the original Rose and Camellia to get the sequel.
5036043	5038464	But I don't think the first game was that hard from what I remember.
5038864	5039364	But it's there.
5040925	5041165	Alright.
5042458	5044499	DarkSakura, what is this week's classic game of the week?
5067279	5070921	I went for Obscure, as in Obscure System.
5071742	5074383	It's a game that came out on the 32X.
5074603	5076244	Have I done 32X games before?
5076424	5077465	I don't think we've had a 32X game yet.
5077505	5081347	I think I might have done... I haven't done Space Harrier, have I?
5081927	5082467	Not to my knowledge.
5082487	5083768	But I'm not doing Space Harrier today.
5084509	5086029	I am doing Knuckles Chaotix.
5087450	5088511	Knuckles Chaotix is cool.
5090253	5091734	Cue that beautiful bean footage.
5091934	5092574	I'm trying.
5092634	5093435	It's going to take me a minute.
5093475	5094815	The YouTube-y is buffering.
5094915	5097016	So tell us a little bit about Knuckles Chaotix.
5097456	5100478	Knuckles Chaotix in Japan was called just Chaotix.
5101058	5107781	And it does feature Knuckles and a bunch of his buddies hanging out on a different island.
5107801	5108462	And Knuckles is...
5111636	5111916	Sorry.
5112336	5113417	Anyway.
5113797	5117458	But basically, you actually have different buddies that go along with you.
5117778	5119619	It's a buddy system game where you're joined by rings.
5120259	5122159	And a band joins the rings together.
5122840	5127201	So, like, say that you are using Knuckles as your main guy.
5127941	5132443	Then Knuckles will be able to climb up walls and float across.
5134443	5135444	You can actually use...
5137938	5141361	I think that SPO does some type of drill move or something.
5141941	5147425	But the whole point of the game is to use a spuddy system to make it through the five different worlds in the game.
5147625	5148666	They're called attractions.
5149306	5156872	And, you know, get to the end and kick MechaSonic's ass and tell Eggman he can piss off.
5157833	5162036	Some of the characters in the game actually did make it into Sonic Heroes.
5162276	5164758	That would be SPO, Vector, and Charmy.
5166379	5166539	And...
5169861	5182565	But also the other thing about this game is that it's one of the first to have, at least on the 32X, I think they had a battery backup on its own, which would save your game and you could go back to it at any time.
5187427	5191048	It's really just, and I'm sure you're watching the gameplay right now, right?
5191840	5199344	Yeah, and to be honest, since I never had a 32X or a Sega Genesis, I mean, sure, I played Sonic the Hedgehog at my friend's house, but I never really played this game, like, ever.
5199824	5205007	But it looks a lot like regular Sonic, but with a little bit of this buddy action kind of going on.
5205187	5209829	Well, the other thing about that is that you do... You've also got your bonus stages and special stages.
5210409	5214171	Your bonus stage, you collect 20 more rings by jumping through large rings that are hidden in the level.
5214871	5217213	You've got spiral free falls and that sort of thing.
5218173	5218893	And you also...
5220294	5221876	Thank you for watching!
5238018	5239219	I do want to say that they were.
5239399	5240739	Don't quote me on that quite yet.
5242080	5255426	Also now, for the people who were into the really, really obscure, there was something that came out on the Genesis emulators back in the day that was called Sonic Crackers.
5256146	5257167	Do you ever remember this, Rob?
5258868	5259148	Uh, no.
5260097	5268646	Sonic Crackers, which had also been titled the Sonic Stadium in Sonic the Hedgehog 4, was a game featuring Sonic and Tails linked by rings.
5269687	5280518	And the very interesting thing about this is that it was pretty much officially called the prototype for Knuckles Chaotix.
5281418	5289321	Proven by the fact that in one of the early Chaotix builds, actually the December 7, 1994 build, the same sprites for Sonic and Tails were found.
5289801	5297663	Although my personal theory is that Sonic and Tails were just used, because it's their Sonic 1 sprites, were used for developmental purposes, to build the engine.
5298123	5305526	And there's levels that actually cross over that have big similarities to levels that were in Chaotix.
5306386	5308889	So, um, it's very, very interesting.
5308929	5310571	I mean, it's really, you know, half the game.
5310591	5314455	You get through with repeating levels and lots of deterioration in the data.
5315156	5322064	But, um, there's, uh, actually Amy Rose is in the sound test on Knuckles Chaotix.
5322084	5326008	And there's actually a way to, on certain copies of it, to switch out...
5327089	5334574	I don't remember which of the characters it is, but you can do a code that switches out one of the characters for Sonic for that same sprite.
5334874	5335114	Nice.
5336435	5340878	And then there's also some of the level music in here.
5340958	5345160	Different versions of the same music was heard in Sonic Crackers.
5345781	5350704	Also, one of the Chaotix builds was labeled as Sonic Crackers 32X.
5354326	5354766	Alright.
5355066	5355867	So we've had a...
5358134	5358855	Looks interesting.
5359455	5362658	It's one of those Sonic games I never really got the chance to play, so hopefully it'll come out.
5362998	5365641	I mean, I know GameTap's been adding 32X games.
5365661	5367162	Maybe it's on there, and I just haven't noticed it.
5367262	5368083	It might be on there.
5368123	5369004	I love these stages.
5369944	5371964	Alright, but this is a bonus stage we're looking at right now in the studio.
5371985	5374185	That's actually a special stage, the Hexagon 3D one.
5374405	5374865	Oh, cool.
5375285	5387208	And actually, it's something that you might think is cool, is that the stage setup for this actually made its way into Sonic Advance, something similar to this.
5388548	5391629	Sorry, the bonus stage one that made it into Sonic Advance.
5393749	5395290	Alright, there you have it.
5396178	5398119	Knuckles Chaotix, your classic game of the week.
5398740	5401782	Check it out on the Sega 32X if you actually have one.
5402682	5403363	I have like two.
5404585	5405686	You going to send one to one of our listeners?
5406666	5407587	I'll ask.
5408508	5411409	Anyhow, that's going to do it for this part A of our Orange Lounge Radio.
5411429	5413651	We've been running awfully long here, almost like an hour and a half into it.
5413671	5414692	So we're going to take a break.
5414732	5418414	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
