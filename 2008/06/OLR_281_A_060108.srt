1
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 1st, 2008.

2
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Could achievement like trophies be coming to PlayStation Network?

3
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:21,593
[SPEAKER_00]: A homebrew version of Portal shows up on the DS.

4
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:24,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And could a video game soon teach you to stop smoking?

5
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:35,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:43,763
[SPEAKER_01]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and occasionally food.

7
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:48,870
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hamburger.

9
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,842
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.

10
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:54,003
[SPEAKER_06]: My husband cooked it.

11
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:57,325
[SPEAKER_06]: He had Worcestershire sauce cooked into it.

12
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:01,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I hear Worcestershire sauce, I think of that one episode of South Park.

13
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:04,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

14
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:04,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

15
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched the end of the Imaginationland episode.

16
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:09,239
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of cool.

17
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: The Worcestershire sauce was like a long time ago.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do with zombies.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

22
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:15,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like pink eye?

23
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:16,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

24
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:20,983
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Worcestershire sauce has caused you to become a zombie, I don't remember what it was.

25
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember when they called the company.

26
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

27
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:23,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

28
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,764
[SPEAKER_06]: My burger was great.

29
00:01:24,904 --> 00:01:25,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

30
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:27,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to tell everybody about this because it was really delicious.

31
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a wheat bun and a little bit of mayonnaise and I put garlic.

32
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:37,434
[SPEAKER_06]: on the bun, like chopped garlic, and mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese.

33
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:39,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a delicious burger.

34
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:40,017
[SPEAKER_06]: It was tasty.

35
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:42,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have Guinness, but I don't think I like beer anymore.

36
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's... Well, Guinness isn't beer, thankfully.

37
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's... I think that I've just lost my taste for a lot of alcoholic beverages.

38
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:51,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,540
[SPEAKER_06]: For now.

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good food week, too, yesterday.

41
00:01:55,042 --> 00:02:00,266
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've had to really eat a lot of very bland, low-fat food, thanks to the pancreas issues I had a couple weeks ago.

42
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:06,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the bright side is I've lost almost 30 pounds now and haven't even had to play an ounce of Wii Fit.

43
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,513
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside is I don't get to eat food I like.

44
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,434
[SPEAKER_01]: But yesterday...

45
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:15,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We were driving to the Bay and I got to go by one of my favorite places in the entire world, Mary's Pizza Shack.

46
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:16,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that place.

47
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:21,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually ate like a pasta dish and the bread and I seem to be okay.

48
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:22,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm good.

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I found something that I think that you might be able to partake of at California Pizza Kitchen.

50
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:27,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's that?

51
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:36,021
[SPEAKER_06]: is that if you have them do light cheese on your pizza and get the wheat crust, you should be able to get away with pizza every now and again.

52
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:39,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can make it yourself, and I will give you recipes, but not on the air.

53
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

54
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because we do have video games to get to.

55
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Also say hello to the other co-host, Loki.

56
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:45,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

57
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minutes into the show and I hadn't introduced you yet.

58
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:49,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry, but food, Loki, food.

59
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:50,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so tired today.

60
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:51,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you tired?

61
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

62
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel all, like, drained.

63
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have no energy.

64
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, like, lethargic, tired?

65
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

66
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I have a birthday coming soon.

67
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting older.

68
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,932
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just, you know, exhausted.

69
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally feel like I have no energy.

70
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

71
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:04,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

72
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:09,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But speaking of food, I saw this thing on the Food Network, actually.

73
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:10,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a local place.

74
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:12,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dive called the Squeeze In.

75
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:13,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard of that?

76
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:15,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have, actually.

77
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:23,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have a burger that's a third pound of beef with a third pound of cheese on it, and it's just huge.

78
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to eat that.

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like too much.

80
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:30,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally is.

81
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:34,258
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the patty, and then there's an extra inch of cheese around the outside.

82
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a knife and fork burger?

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,600
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

84
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.

85
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,184
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, anyhow, look, enough food.

86
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:49,433
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to get to our gaming week, so I do want to introduce the ever-present other host on our show, you, the chatters, chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join our chat room.

87
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:52,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, of course, you can wait until we open up the Skype line later in the show.

88
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:55,019
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our mailbag that's already pretty full.

89
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.

90
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to point out some comments in chat at chat.orangelongeradio.com.

91
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Tetsuya was expressing surprise.

92
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:24,982
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

93
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:26,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie doesn't like beer anymore?

94
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:26,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

95
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:30,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really so much that I don't like it.

96
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:35,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that I'll go ahead and say this right now.

97
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:45,252
[SPEAKER_06]: The past couple of weeks, like I was telling you earlier today, I've been having digestion problems of my own and beer has been making me very pained.

98
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:49,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, alcohol is just bad for your digestion system in general.

99
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:49,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

100
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

101
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,130
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.

102
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I will probably not be able to drink alcohol for like a year if ever again.

103
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:55,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I mentioned this on last week's show.

104
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,593
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.

105
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:57,853
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the end of the world.

106
00:04:57,873 --> 00:04:59,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I found I'm okay with like a little bit of wine.

107
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,195
[SPEAKER_06]: But like.

108
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,773
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's Poo in a few hours

109
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:32,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Gross!

110
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:42,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the other reason I actually ate my cheeseburger is I'm experimenting with my food because I'm actually writing down everything I eat so I can see what hurts.

111
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,980
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura gave me that look of, why did you read that comment?

112
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:55,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Geekboy2424 says that he just recently watched the YouTube video this week of Loki drunk playing Mario Kart.

113
00:05:55,546 --> 00:06:00,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember we have a YouTube channel and there's things like, that was you at your bachelor party quite some time ago playing Mario Kart drunk.

114
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:00,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

115
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

116
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that we'll have more things on YouTube soon.

117
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:06,412
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news is that we have no webcam tonight.

118
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,333
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no Justin TV.

119
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:07,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad news?

120
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:13,155
[SPEAKER_01]: The webcam broke, and so the audio doesn't work anymore.

121
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:17,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I can use the built-in speaker on the Mac, but listening to last week's show, it sucked.

122
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:19,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing, though.

123
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I've picked out the video camera I want to get.

124
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:28,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good news is that the video camera can also double as a webcam, but it can also be a video camera to go out and shoot more shenanigans.

125
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:38,992
[SPEAKER_02]: You should get that one that they had at, what was it, at the lounge that All Games used to be in where they could control it and turn it and stuff.

126
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:39,813
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not a webcam.

127
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an actual video camera.

128
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, it's not porn unless you tape it.

129
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then I can also start my amateur porn studio with my new video camera.

130
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:48,962
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just kidding.

131
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:50,263
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, okay.

132
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:53,715
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

133
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:08,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

134
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,937
[SPEAKER_06]: That story is for later, but anyway.

135
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:20,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to also, I've been getting on my husband because he's supposed to be getting me The World Ends With You, and every time he says he's gonna do it, oh, the store doesn't have it.

136
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:24,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't go to another?

137
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:25,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

138
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:28,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'll have to suffer.

139
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Evil man!

140
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So The World Ends With Dan.

141
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:35,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but, but, but, but.

142
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:40,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have a really, really awesome game of World Cup Soccer Pinball.

143
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

144
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's working on our Black Knight 2000!

145
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:43,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy!

146
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:44,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

147
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,293
[SPEAKER_01]: You were telling me a funny story about Grand Theft Auto.

148
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:47,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want to talk about it now or later.

149
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:48,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

150
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:48,695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.

151
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:50,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

152
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:52,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I was watching Will play.

153
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:54,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Will is Dan's, pretty much his best buddy.

154
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,159
[SPEAKER_01]: BFF.

155
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:04,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I was watching him play right before I left, just like as I was leaving with my hamburger in hand.

156
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:08,462
[SPEAKER_06]: He was ordering from Burger King in the game.

157
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:10,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Burger Shot.

158
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Or whatever the crap it is.

159
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:13,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Burger Hell.

160
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were talking about Falling Down, though.

161
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,765
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that movie, what was it, Kurt Russell?

162
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Douglas

163
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he gets his burger, holds out the gun, and she's like, oh shit.

164
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:53,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, they, I guess it's like, they instantly go into this panic, deer in the headlights look.

165
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:57,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would too, I mean, I've had a gun pointed at my face before, so I know the thing.

166
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:01,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he shoots her, and then like five other people pull up behind him and pull out guns.

167
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:01,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

168
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:15,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving, bye and then he also made a motorcycle appear from nowhere and promptly crashed it and his friend landed on his head and we thought he died but he got up and I was like, your friend's really thick

169
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:26,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So... Part of me does want to pick up Grand Theft Auto just for the lulz alone in situations like that, but I have this bad feeling it'll wear off quickly.

170
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:27,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I get more amusement watching other people play it.

171
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have to remember, Grand Theft Auto is not usually my thing, you know?

172
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,193
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, I guess I really should... I enjoyed watching Loki play it, so I should probably get it.

173
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:37,094
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

174
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,676
[SPEAKER_01]: The multiplayer is probably fun, too.

175
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:41,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

176
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:42,987
[SPEAKER_01]: What did somebody say in chat here?

177
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:46,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, SJ100Matt says, Jamie gets into her house by playing pinball.

178
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:48,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome security system.

179
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

180
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:49,918
[SPEAKER_06]: The story.

181
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:50,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick.

182
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:53,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I got locked out of my house yesterday.

183
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I have this little pouch on the side of my purse.

184
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:58,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I put my keys in and my keys fell out.

185
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:04,897
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get outside, shut the security door, make sure it's locked, and then realize when I'm reaching in my purse, I do not have my keys on me.

186
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan can't leave the store to come help me in.

187
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:14,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't get a hold of anybody who either A, has the keys to some part of my house, or can take me to go get Dan's.

188
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:22,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going around the house and I found out that one of the screens actually didn't have the little protective tab in it, which we are going to remedy.

189
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: and I got the screen out, climbed up on this chair that we have outside for some unknown reason had to contort to freaking get in the window because I'm still too short and slid down a pinball machine the only window that I could get in was the one that Dan has the no fear pinball backed up against so I had to actually push it

190
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:40,614
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

191
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:57,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

192
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not be breaking into DarkSakura's house.

193
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:01,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks.

194
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,383
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I'll kill you.

195
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:02,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

196
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

197
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played more Grand Theft Auto 4.

198
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:09,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

199
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just working towards 100% stuff.

200
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you shoot anyone in the face?

201
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm pretty sure I did.

202
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:21,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so I finished all the pigeons.

203
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:22,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed all the pigeons.

204
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I did all the stunt jumps today.

205
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:30,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm doing the random friends, I guess is what they call it.

206
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:31,777
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's random people you meet on the street.

207
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,737
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different missions.

208
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't get this one to trigger because I think I passed it up somewhere.

209
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:36,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

210
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:40,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of annoying because if I can't get the trigger, then I can't get 100%.

211
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would really suck.

212
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,841
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I played this game.

213
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:48,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a demo for a game called Crash Time because I thought, hey, this is going to be cool.

214
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:55,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a European game that looks really cheesy and it was cheap and I tried it out and it's not very good.

215
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like an arcade chase game.

216
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,718
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the police and you have to do different things.

217
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:05,081
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have it where you have to do 30% damage to the person you're chasing and

218
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:09,104
[SPEAKER_02]: MakeEmStop for three seconds or something like that.

219
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried that, and I just didn't care for it.

220
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:12,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of dumb.

221
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:16,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing will replace my Earth Defense Force 2017.

222
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:19,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see.

223
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:24,030
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, actually, I think that was about it for my gaming week.

224
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.

225
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:29,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I played anything else.

226
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

227
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:31,894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

228
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

229
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I played more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted to Warcraft.

230
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:38,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

231
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:44,334
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to announce that our guild finally full cleared Karazhan this week.

232
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:45,756
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a full clear of Karazhan.

233
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,419
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a WoW nerd to understand what that means.

234
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a full clear on Kara and one boss down in Zolomon.

235
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And considering there aren't 25 of us to run the big raids, we have to do the little raids, it's great.

236
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:01,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very excited at the news that Wrath of the Lich King is going to have 10 mans equivalent to every 25 man.

237
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:02,786
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me very happy.

238
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, enough wow nerddom.

239
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play some other games this week.

240
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:14,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded a new game from the Steam service, which as you know is kind of like PC's answer to Xbox Live, I guess you could say.

241
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:15,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by Valve.

242
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:17,907
[SPEAKER_01]: The company did Orange Box and all that stuff.

243
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,868
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell a lot of other games on there, some independent games.

244
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:22,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I just decided to check out Audiosurf.

245
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:24,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

246
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:53,351
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

247
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:22,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

248
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of neat because the game does come with its own soundtrack.

249
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,871
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with the Orange Box soundtrack because, you know, hello, it's Valve.

250
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:49,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can play still alive in Audiosurf to your heart's content.

251
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:59,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's one thing I thought was kind of interesting about Audiosurf is that as you're playing the game, in the results screen that comes up, it will still show you

252
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:02,395
[SPEAKER_01]: and Leaderboards for the song you played.

253
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:05,717
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it doesn't matter what song you played from your library.

254
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:16,522
[SPEAKER_01]: The servers, I guess, keep track of all the file names or it must be some type of algorithm between file name and the way the music file was read by the game.

255
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,624
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the CD database, how they have those.

256
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, but it's not really playing off a CD either.

257
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll take it off the...

258
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the MD5 hash or whatever?

259
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:26,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of something like that.

260
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:37,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was really cool because I played an Echo Image song, which Echo Image is kind of an obscure band unless you're really familiar with the DDR series or synth pop in general.

261
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my surprise, there were a couple other people that had played the same song I did.

262
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:43,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was kind of neat the way they had the leaderboards in that game.

263
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have your own friends list and all that good stuff.

264
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steam has its own achievements-like thing that you can do in AudioSurf.

265
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,504
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other thing about AudioSurf is that...

266
00:15:52,444 --> 00:16:01,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did it have, like, the Klax-style gameplay, which is kind of cool because it reads the file in advance, and the track is kind of like a giant roller coaster.

267
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:08,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, and during the really intense part of the songs, you're going, like, straight downhill, and you're going really fast, and you have to collect these blocks really fast.

268
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:14,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during the more slow build-up parts of the songs, you know, like, you know the song Skulk by Echo Image?

269
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,382
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, during that little, like, tiny instrumental part, like, it's just building up, do-do-do.

270
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:20,323
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

271
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,966
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that you can pick different types of ships as well that you can control.

272
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of changes the core element of the game.

273
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:51,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the Klax thing is too confusing for you, there's like a simple ship that you can pick where the blocks are either gray or they're colored.

274
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:55,510
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is collect colored blocks, avoid gray blocks.

275
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,630
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very easy.

276
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of step up the different types.

277
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:04,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can do like a ship that will shuffle the colors occasionally or a ship where you can hold blocks individually.

278
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of neat.

279
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed the game.

280
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:18,724
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is that I didn't think a lot of times the music making algorithm that made the tracks and the blocks wasn't often really in time with the music.

281
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:27,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not going to have something as spot on as Beatmania 2DX or DDR or Rock Band or any of those things that are pre-programmed for the songs in it.

282
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:35,735
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I cut it a little slack because considering you can play any song in the world, you know, there's only so much you can do to get it accurate.

283
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:44,358
[SPEAKER_01]: And for what it's worth, I did think the uphill-downhill things, like it's very good at detecting, you know, lots of volume, little volume, and kind of building the course that way.

284
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give it props for that.

285
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would recommend the game because it's only $10.

286
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:50,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

287
00:17:50,848 --> 00:18:00,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to, you can hopefully hope that this game is going to come out on Xbox Live because there's rumors that the game might be coming out on Xbox Live and I think that's a really good place for it is Xbox Live.

288
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:01,948
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the problem.

289
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:09,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason why it works so well as a PC game is the fact that you can use any MP3 you want or any song you want directly from your drive.

290
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:16,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, on Xbox you can import your own music files, yeah, but do the masses really know how to do that?

291
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:17,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not so much.

292
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how successful the game would be on Xbox Live, but I'd still be all for it.

293
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:27,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like there aren't other games that do use the extended soundtrack, every Extend Extra Extreme.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

295
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:29,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

296
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, reading some comments in chats.

297
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:38,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Banjo asks, Sky, can't people just edit the ID3 tags and cheat the leaderboards?

298
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Banjo, I don't think so because the leaderboards are independent for each song.

299
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:44,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't notice any type of comprehensive leaderboard.

300
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:47,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you edit the ID3 tag, then you're on a new song.

301
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it's the ID3 tag.

302
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:50,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it may be just...

303
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:54,681
[SPEAKER_02]: HitStun says, actually it only looks at the artist and song title tags.

304
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:58,704
[SPEAKER_01]: No hash checking is done and people cheat by playing 20 minute songs tagged to look like other songs.

305
00:18:58,724 --> 00:18:59,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's messed up.

306
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:20,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe Audiosurf needs to consider the length of the MP3 as well.

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,121
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be a good idea.

308
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

309
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:25,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So Audiosurf, I liked.

310
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really the only new game I played this week.

311
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:27,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I take that back.

312
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:31,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I played that new Sudoku game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

313
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:31,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

314
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:36,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sudoku, folks.

315
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:42,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, if you haven't played Sudoku and you're a big Sudoku fan... Here's the thing.

316
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I've abstained by choice.

317
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:52,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I give Xbox Live props for trying to put games out there that are going to appeal to other people than just hardcore gamers.

318
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,394
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if this is it.

319
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:55,014
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

320
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:56,334
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be delisted soon.

321
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:57,775
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be delisted in six months anyway.

322
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:01,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played the Warlords game as well, which was... I'm sorry.

323
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:05,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little more fun with that because I remember the old school Warlords game, but they really kind of changed it.

324
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:12,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can notice for yourself, play the new, because you can do the demo, play the evolved version versus the old version.

325
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,507
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it works is kind of different.

326
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:20,492
[SPEAKER_01]: The new version is more like Breakout, which, yeah, the old version was too, but the ways the castles were shaped were even different.

327
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, it plays a lot differently and not as fast.

328
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:24,655
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.

329
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:25,795
[SPEAKER_01]: No thanks, I think I'll skip it.

330
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:26,116
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.

331
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:35,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least it's only five bucks, and I bet Xbox Live is kind of fun, but I think Warlords is one of those games you best remember as something that was at Chuck E. Cheese when you were a kid.

332
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:39,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly, this one I'm noticing about a lot of the retro titles on Xbox Live.

333
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:43,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but Discs of Tron.

334
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,318
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of disappointing to play on Xbox Live, because that was one of those games that's best left in my childhood.

335
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:49,540
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you do?

336
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:54,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into tonight's news.

337
00:20:54,977 --> 00:21:04,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Really only a little bit of housekeeping tonight, and that is that if you are unaware, our 6th anniversary show is coming up in 3 weeks, if you can believe it or not.

338
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:11,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio started on June 23rd of 2002, and so in about 3 weeks we're going to be looking at our 6th anniversary show.

339
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,872
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no idea what to do.

340
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:14,892
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

341
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:49,285
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll see because the show has always been about the chatters and the listeners and interacting so why not we'll be your monkeys this anniversary within reason I mean if you know the suggestion is you know naked show that's probably not going to happen

342
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Actdeft, we're not having a fuck show until we don't say we are.

343
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:54,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

344
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,434
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck show is a surprise.

345
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:58,155
[SPEAKER_01]: First rule about fuck show, you don't talk about fuck show.

346
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:01,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't really made up any other rules beyond that because we have to have rules for that.

347
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:02,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

348
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody has to moderate and all that fun stuff.

349
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll plan it.

350
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:06,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.

351
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:08,562
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the first thing.

352
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,623
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

353
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,224
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.

354
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,059
[SPEAKER_01]: and Brad from PodCulture says, drunk fuck show.

355
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get drunk right now because of everything else going on.

356
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,561
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

357
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:20,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow.

358
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:22,722
[SPEAKER_05]: We could give you some LSD.

359
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:24,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could probably smoke pot.

360
00:22:24,963 --> 00:22:25,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be okay.

361
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,603
[SPEAKER_05]: You could.

362
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:27,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot's not bad.

363
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:28,824
[SPEAKER_01]: No, drugs are bad, okay?

364
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:30,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Drugs are bad, okay?

365
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:31,225
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

366
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:32,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

367
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:34,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some gaming news.

368
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, Loki, save the show from drug talk.

369
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:51,661
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this week there was an event being held in France for Ubi Days 2008, where they were showing off a bunch of their titles, and one that they showed off only in trailer form, and it was kind of at the closing of the conference.

370
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:52,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

371
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:54,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond Good and Evil 2.

372
00:22:55,564 --> 00:23:00,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being reimagined now for the next-gen consoles, and I'd imagine probably the PC as well.

373
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:05,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a little teaser trailer, which you can see Uncle Page.

374
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:07,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

375
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:08,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool.

376
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:13,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really played the first Beyond Good and Evil, so I don't really know what to expect from this.

377
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:21,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond Good and Evil is one of those really cult hits kind of things, so I know there's a lot of people very excited about this, because I think a lot of people didn't think it would ever happen.

378
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:22,473
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

379
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:23,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good, though.

380
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:25,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

381
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:28,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll probably find out more about this during E3.

382
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:32,457
[SPEAKER_01]: That little pig guy thing kind of scared me, just so you know.

383
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:34,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the pictures of that?

384
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:34,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

385
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,858
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very scary.

386
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:36,498
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Uncle Paige.

387
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:37,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that scared me.

388
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:43,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Also coming to the PlayStation pretty soon because Beyond Good and Evil 2 is PS3, right?

389
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,394
[SPEAKER_01]: All the next-gen systems, right?

390
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:45,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.

391
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:52,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also coming to the PlayStation 3 sometime eventually will be Home, Sony Home.

392
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:56,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ubisoft has announced that they are going to be doing something special for Home.

393
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,721
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to be doing one of their events online.

394
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:01,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.

395
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:09,446
[SPEAKER_01]: In the PlayStation Home media and events space, they're going to be showing off all these new Ubisoft titles.

396
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, HAWX, Hawks or whatever.

397
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 4.

398
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,550
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.

399
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,092
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only get there if you have a closed beta account.

400
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:19,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 4?

401
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:21,613
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.

402
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:23,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not an Ubisoft title.

403
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:24,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that's on the list.

404
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:26,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe that's sharing the space.

405
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:26,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

406
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:27,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

407
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,932
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever, there are these other games at least as well that are going to be in the space.

408
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:38,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool, yeah, because I know right now it's only open, or I should say it's closed beta right now, so those are the only people that are able to enjoy that.

409
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And prior to this, they did a recreation of the Sony, I think they call it PlayStation Day.

410
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of showing what it would look like for future events, which I think is pretty cool that they have this whole interactive thing going on.

411
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:57,287
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a different way to approach it.

412
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of interesting.

413
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:07,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, since the rest of us can't go to E3 anymore because we're not in the Cool Kids Club, you know, we could go to E3 in home, which I think is kind of interesting.

414
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:12,379
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the more I think of it, the more I don't really care that we're in the good graces of publishers.

415
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we get to say whatever we want in the show.

416
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:17,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind either.

417
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So, screw it.

418
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the hell with them.

419
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:25,089
[SPEAKER_06]: We can say something sucks as much as we want to.

420
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:25,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

421
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:29,739
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to review Metal Gear Solid 4 early, we can.

422
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake is old.

423
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,856
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about the hard drive space all we want.

424
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's probably why we don't have advanced screeners.

425
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably why we don't get advanced screeners.

426
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:45,007
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming out though on the Japanese PlayStation Store.

427
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:45,427
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

428
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:46,928
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on the 26th of June.

429
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:50,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I read this, my response was LOL what?

430
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:53,232
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a gardening game.

431
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Shikitei.

432
00:25:56,314 --> 00:26:03,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically you can go outside and plant trees and plant flowers and watch them grow.

433
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:26,948
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's supposed to be um 1600 yen and it's supposed to be relaxing for the older gamer there's no word if we're ever getting it but i i was just like what and it made me think about the saturn game that came out that was all audio and it came with seeds and he was and it was supposed to help your plant grow

434
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:31,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so correct me if I'm wrong.

435
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:32,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.

436
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:37,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are saying now that I can use my PlayStation 3 to watch the grass grow.

437
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:38,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

438
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:46,282
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even get the benefit of insects or animals to scamper through your garden and eat the leaves off of your petunias.

439
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:47,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

440
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,923
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can plant cherry trees.

441
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just go plant real trees?

442
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,347
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the beauty of video games

443
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:15,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

444
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:18,207
[SPEAKER_02]: How about spend the 1600 yen on something better?

445
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like tacos.

446
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:24,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

447
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:31,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you can find tacos in Japan, but if I had 1600 yen, I would just go be buying maybe some Anpan or something.

448
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:32,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Anpan is delicious.

449
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:35,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a dream game brainstorm.

450
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,135
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of video game could they make about tacos?

451
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:40,572
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

452
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:07,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I love chicken sauce tacos.

453
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:08,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacos are not lame.

454
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:09,597
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's lame?

455
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:10,157
[SPEAKER_01]: You're lame.

456
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:11,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacos are not lame.

457
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's lame?

458
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Your butt.

459
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:15,243
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's lame?

460
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:17,546
[SPEAKER_02]: A gardening game on any system.

461
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Viva Pinata minus the pinatas.

462
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the Viva.

463
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:24,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Viva, yes.

464
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:27,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinata Verte.

465
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:30,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to cover that for the, what the hell are they thinking?

466
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's only in Japan, right?

467
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:37,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's a neat idea that they're putting out a game that's different.

468
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:38,323
[SPEAKER_02]: For old people!

469
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,445
[SPEAKER_02]: For old people that will buy practically anything, I guess.

470
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:45,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But 1,600 yen seems... It was 1,600 yen?

471
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

472
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,108
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems kind of expensive.

473
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like seven bucks.

474
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still expensive.

475
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why am I saying seven bucks?

476
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:53,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

477
00:28:54,953 --> 00:28:55,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe $16.50.

478
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like $15 about, right?

479
00:28:58,921 --> 00:28:59,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's lame.

480
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:02,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have tea agrees.

481
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Taco Time would be an amazing name for a game.

482
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:05,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly.

483
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:12,980
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't officially add anything to the Dream Games list yet, but be thinking about Taco Time.

484
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:14,701
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a game in there somewhere.

485
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,102
[SPEAKER_06]: More tacos, less drugs.

486
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:19,485
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a remake of Burger Time and add other food to it.

487
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:21,006
[SPEAKER_02]: That you create other things.

488
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only burgers, but other meals and stuff.

489
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, bored now.

490
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because it was a bad idea anyway.

491
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's your Taco Time.

492
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:29,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad idea.

493
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:30,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Dream Game.

494
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:31,273
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

495
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:32,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Action Bastard the game.

496
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:34,316
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

497
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: No Dream Games tonight.

498
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:42,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, one game that's not being included in the new firmware for the PS3 is Taco Time.

499
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: But some other things are going to be added in there.

500
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all, of course, rumors, but there's a lot of, I don't know...

501
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Evidence to point towards it.

502
00:29:54,314 --> 00:30:08,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rumor is that they're adding both the in-game cross-media bar, which is something that should have been there, I don't know, from the start, and trophies, which, you know, is Sony's way of saying, hey, we like achievements, but how can we get around a lawsuit?

503
00:30:09,623 --> 00:30:11,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So those will be coming very soon.

504
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:16,086
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they have been spotted already in...

505
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:45,864
[SPEAKER_02]: a video showing the new Bioshock for Playstation 3 apparently a member of MaxConsoleForums has posted some images and video during Bioshock that they found so interesting but either way you know these are coming because you know they've announced this previously it's just a matter of time but then again it could get delayed forever like Home has and everything else Sony related so

506
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:48,697
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

507
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:49,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

508
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:50,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is a good idea?

509
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:51,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something PlayStation needs?

510
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:52,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

511
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I know achievements have gotten me to play games I probably wouldn't normally play.

512
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:59,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's only a good thing for them.

513
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:02,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I mean, sure, we'll get over it.

514
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:07,054
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, since we haven't gotten over it yet, I still think it's a cheap ripoff.

515
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,757
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, more power to them, I guess.

516
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,897
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I got a private message from Cheeseburger in chat who's suggesting that Taco Time could be like Taco Mama instead of Cooking Mama.

517
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:19,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Taco Mama.

518
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,859
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be Cooking Mama Junk Food Edition.

519
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, they do have a restaurant called Taco Time.

520
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:28,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have Tia saying, is everyone else seriously missing the sexual euphemism?

521
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:30,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not at all.

522
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,526
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be Fish Taco Time.

523
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,268
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the bonus stage.

524
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,470
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, forget it.

525
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough about tacos.

526
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:39,991
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

527
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually an in-joke amongst me and some other people.

528
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:46,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

529
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:46,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

530
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:50,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're talking about muffins.

531
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:51,671
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that?

532
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:53,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Muffins are also sexual.

533
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Muffins!

534
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:56,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana muffins.

535
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood muffins.

536
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood muffin?

537
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:02,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

538
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:05,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the YouTube thing about... Forget it.

539
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:06,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow...

540
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,271
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation 3 game End War is going to be getting some very interesting types of controls.

541
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:20,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Gesture-activated commands are coming soon to the End War game, which is a Tom Clancy game.

542
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:29,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, you actually use the PlayStation Eye to do it, and you can wave your hands, like if you wave your hand underneath the camera, then you get the game's overhead map.

543
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:31,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I don't know, it's kind of...

544
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

545
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:45,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why Par Par Paradise really took off, huh?

546
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:52,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Strangely enough, nothing about a 360 equivalent because there is that whole vision camera, but no word yet about that.

547
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:57,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the vision camera sucks and the PlayStation Eye is supposed to be a little bit more detailed.

548
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:02,139
[SPEAKER_02]: How much different are they really besides maybe resolution?

549
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:03,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

550
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:06,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my vision camera hasn't been used ever since I got it.

551
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I took my picture with it and I was about as far as I went.

552
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I tried playing Totem Ball and then that sucked too.

553
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:15,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But the PlayStation Eye, I guess it's a good use of it.

554
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:21,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'd rather see those, you know, other games that they had that they were showing off little tech demos for.

555
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:33,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, I mean, if you want some crappy use for a $30 camera, then sure, let's just make it so I can wave my hand under the camera instead of, I don't know, pushing a button.

556
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:35,650
[SPEAKER_02]: What's easier?

557
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, if we're going to be lazy here, pushing a button or waving your hand?

558
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:40,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pushing the button.

559
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:45,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, this is still in development and may not actually make the final cut of the game.

560
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:47,918
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that's being played with right now.

561
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:51,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think it'd be gesture control, like flipping off the enemy or something.

562
00:33:51,460 --> 00:34:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now if they had it where you're actually... Because the article referred the control to being similar to Total Recall.

563
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:02,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not Total Recall...

564
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Minority Report.

565
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:05,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell?

566
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrong movie there.

567
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:14,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if it was more like that where you're actually using your hands to move a map around and stuff like that, that'd be kind of cool.

568
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:18,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to wave your hand to bring up a map is kind of stupid.

569
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:33,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Sully907 is commenting on the previous story about the firmware once firmware 2.4 comes out the PlayStation Network becomes on par with Xbox Live Xbox Live is still slightly better but not enough to justify $50 anymore agree or disagree?

570
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:42,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't agree, because I still think as far as content that's on there, there's a lot less content on the PlayStation Network.

571
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:55,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, download content's a little on par, especially with some of the games that are coming out in both systems, but as far as original games and new PlayStation Network games, there really hasn't been that many that have come out.

572
00:34:55,328 --> 00:34:57,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not every week like Xbox Live Arcade.

573
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,872
[SPEAKER_02]: True, although I do think maybe it's time for Xbox Live to get a little price cut.

574
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:02,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

575
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:03,593
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

576
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:04,974
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do tend to update a lot more.

577
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should, too, especially since they're advertising on there.

578
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:09,278
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

579
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay a monthly subscription to watch ads.

580
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:14,343
[SPEAKER_01]: When has that ever stopped other games from doing the same thing?

581
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

582
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:17,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're talking about motion-based games in chat.

583
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:20,149
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about Power, Power, Power Dice and all this stuff.

584
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:21,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Crunky Boy Jr.

585
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:26,034
[SPEAKER_01]: says they should have a spin-off of the Wii Fit hula hoop game where you put symbols in your ass.

586
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure how that works, but okay.

587
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:36,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Wii Fit and the hula hoop game, I doubt you've seen this, DarkSakura, but Loki, did you see the YouTube this week?

588
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:38,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It was posted on Dig.

589
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,333
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some guy taping his girlfriend playing the Wii Fit hula hoop game.

590
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:44,213
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.

591
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:48,536
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a nice-looking gal, and she had a nice little booty on her, right?

592
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:51,098
[SPEAKER_01]: She was wearing nothing but panties.

593
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:52,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she was wearing panties and a T-shirt.

594
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:17,971
[SPEAKER_01]: and the thing is that while she's playing the hula hoop game the boyfriend like zooms in on her butt and put it on the internet for everybody to see and now it's everywhere and at the very end of the video like the guy puts the camera on himself and he gives one of those like yeah type of looks if you haven't seen it it's hilarious I'm gonna find it I can't believe you guys haven't seen it I'm gonna find it

595
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it in studio after the next story.

596
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:26,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really look at Dig anymore because, well, especially their gaming topics, I've already seen most of that, step by time.

597
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:31,395
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of crap on there, but there's some decent stories that sometimes slip under the radar, like this one.

598
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll find it on YouTube for you guys while we cover the next story.

599
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:35,496
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that decent?

600
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:36,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds indecent.

601
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:38,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have something more decent.

602
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:43,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the PAL PSN update of stuff-ness.

603
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:45,579
[SPEAKER_06]: They got something good.

604
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, one good thing.

605
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:53,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix MatchingService.com

606
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:31,214
[SPEAKER_06]: it's £6.99 over there so everyone download it they also have Rayman on the PS3 and PC store for PSP for £3.49 also Medieval Resurrection for PSP out for £14.99 and Go Sudoku packs at £1.99 or you can download the whole thing for £4.99 and the Army of Two Veteran Map Pack

607
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,357
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Prince of Persia wallpaper, like you care, but hey.

608
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all.

609
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:43,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess there are quite a few things coming to PlayStation Network after all.

610
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:44,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knew?

611
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:47,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, late at least.

612
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:47,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

613
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Better eventually than not at all.

614
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Search for a user on YouTube.

615
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,460
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Tinsley Advertising.

616
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,220
[SPEAKER_01]: T-I-N-S-L-E-Y Advertising.

617
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,040
[SPEAKER_01]: All one word there.

618
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit.

619
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the girl.

620
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:21,101
[SPEAKER_01]: She's starting to play Wii Fit.

621
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:24,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at that.

622
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:29,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and she's kind of like, you can tell she's kind of one of those cute nerdy girls too.

623
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:32,485
[SPEAKER_01]: She's wearing glasses and got a little ponytail, right?

624
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:36,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she has this little booty on her.

625
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:37,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's playing Wii Fit.

626
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:39,607
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, Loki?

627
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:43,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

628
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki gave thumbs up.

629
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:49,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry we don't have just the TV tonight so you can see how Loki gave the thumbs up there.

630
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,171
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, offensive or funny?

631
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:55,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm apathetic towards it.

632
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:55,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Ambivalent.

633
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:56,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Ambivalent would work.

634
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It was her idea.

635
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:59,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was.

636
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:02,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know you were filming me.

637
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:06,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to the end of the video just because you have to see this guy when he looks at the camera.

638
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,537
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah.

639
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:10,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

640
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:15,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you put the link in the chat room, so.

641
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,688
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

642
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:17,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look.

643
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now we're going to get a whole bunch of the chat room going.

644
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:25,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm not even going to look at the chat room.

645
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:25,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

646
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:30,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Actdeft is questioning my sexuality because, you know, I'm the gay one on the show, but I like girls.

647
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:32,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have an appreciation for the female form.

648
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:37,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the, you know, I can see why people like this video.

649
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: She's taking it as a compliment.

650
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:39,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

651
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:42,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they releasing it in Africa?

652
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:42,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

653
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:11,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume so, since that's not Europe.

654
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, maybe.

655
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really bad if Africa was excluded from their own game.

656
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:20,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to run over the animals.

657
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:21,873
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way I will buy this game.

658
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,114
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need to do a new Jumbo Safari.

659
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:33,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, if you ever wanted to go to a virtual safari, then Africa is the game for you.

660
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be coming out in August.

661
00:40:37,122 --> 00:40:38,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know what Africa is yet?

662
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything about it?

663
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:41,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it a taking pictures game?

664
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:43,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

665
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Snap, but not with Pokemon?

666
00:40:48,344 --> 00:40:48,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

667
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:51,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at the other games that have come out that have been very similar.

668
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Endless Ocean.

669
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,106
[SPEAKER_02]: No one bought that.

670
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild Earth African Safari.

671
00:40:58,526 --> 00:40:59,387
[SPEAKER_02]: No one bought that.

672
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:02,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Snap.

673
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:04,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time ago, people bought it because it's Pokemon.

674
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:05,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's fun!

675
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:07,418
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

676
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:29,619
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a Sakura Taisen game, I think, that came out that had a bunch of weird, bizarre shit in it.

677
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:37,665
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good thing is, though, if you are in Europe and you really, really, really want to play Africa... Region free, right?

678
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:38,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

679
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So just import the US one.

680
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:40,707
Africa.

681
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:41,908
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an HDTV.

682
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:43,489
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

683
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:45,090
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

684
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

685
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:48,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

686
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:50,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioshock Bioshock

687
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:18,605
[SPEAKER_01]: New features and content that will make this a must-have game for its new audience as well as for those who enjoyed it on other platforms.

688
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:22,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that means additional levels or weapons or other types of things.

689
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,773
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I hope it's not multiplayer finally or something, you know?

690
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:29,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine if PlayStation 3 had like the Deathmatch exclusive?

691
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:30,036
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

692
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:31,916
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they won't do that.

693
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:34,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that games and mechanics were built for that.

694
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:41,079
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, if they were talking about new content in there, I bet you it's the download content that was already available on the Xbox and PC.

695
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a bonus level or something, right?

696
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think they're going to do that.

697
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe another difficulty or something like that.

698
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,502
[SPEAKER_01]: What would make me want to re-buy it if I already had it on the other systems?

699
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there was some really good extras.

700
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:56,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're talking about a cheap game here.

701
00:42:57,312 --> 00:42:57,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

702
00:42:57,572 --> 00:42:58,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the game will be cheap.

703
00:42:58,372 --> 00:42:59,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that'll be the kicker.

704
00:42:59,493 --> 00:42:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

705
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:16,036
[SPEAKER_02]: What they could do, they could do like some of the other cheap stuff that some other first person shooters have done like a survival mode where they just keep sending enemies at you and see how long you can survive or I don't know more plasmids I guess they could add to it.

706
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:21,218
[SPEAKER_01]: WhatUpG in chat is asking when is Bioshock 2 due out?

707
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:22,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know anything about Bioshock 2?

708
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:23,458
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

709
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:24,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 09 holiday.

710
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:24,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

711
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

712
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:30,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see what happens.

713
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:35,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still shaking my head over this next story.

714
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:36,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

715
00:43:36,877 --> 00:43:40,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people are so gullible.

716
00:43:42,345 --> 00:43:51,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anyone has seen the Fallout 3 screenshots that were out that shows basically Washington turned into a big, you know, soot-covered smoking crater.

717
00:43:53,452 --> 00:44:00,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But an intelligence contractor called SITE, S-I-T-E, Intel Group...

718
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:06,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought that they were Al-Qaeda images, you know, propaganda.

719
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And a few, I guess, anti-U.S.

720
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:19,862
[SPEAKER_06]: sites posted them up, you know, and had chat logs and everything about it, saying that this was their big dream to see or whatever.

721
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:22,506
[SPEAKER_06]: There were screens for Fallout 3.

722
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:26,472
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't heard any word back officially.

723
00:44:28,155 --> 00:44:34,445
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that I did think was funny in this article on Kotaku is that Sight is based in Bethesda.

724
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's actually terrorists are using those images from Fallout 3 or supposed terrorists.

725
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:44,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think they're just affiliated sites.

726
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're actually... I think they're just like terrorist fanboys or something.

727
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrorist fanboys?

728
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:59,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, any political faction is gonna have their little follower, so... And just to kind of go back a few... Well, it's not even really a story, but...

729
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:04,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That YouTube that you were talking about there, apparently there were some comments on the dig for it.

730
00:45:05,256 --> 00:45:13,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tinsley Advertising actually replied back and said, Sorry guys, I got on our dig front page and well, my girlfriend found out and she's a tiny bit upset.

731
00:45:13,886 --> 00:45:20,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cute and it actually, or it was done with good intentions if she ever doubted how hot she is.

732
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:24,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 1 million views on that YouTube, though.

733
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's an internet star, at least her buddy is.

734
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:30,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because you never see her face.

735
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:33,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine walking by her on the street?

736
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:35,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do I know you from?

737
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:35,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do I know you from?

738
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:38,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as she's leaving, I remember!

739
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:42,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

740
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:43,914
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

741
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:48,978
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of, you know, if Dan did that, I'd have to smack him.

742
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:56,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Amaze Satsuma in chat says, I would buy Bioshock again if it came with the living Big Daddy than just the statue.

743
00:45:57,101 --> 00:45:57,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

744
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:02,624
[SPEAKER_01]: About the Fallout things, though, I saw that picture of the whole Washington, D.C.

745
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:07,667
[SPEAKER_01]: looking destroyed thing, and it is pretty scary how realistic some of these games are getting.

746
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:10,789
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I mean, remember Independence Day?

747
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:12,627
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

748
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:36,640
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

749
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:24,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I thought was funny Okay, the chatroom agrees it was 1995 So, I mean, it's not like we haven't seen these horrific images, quote-unquote, before But, you know, at least when you're watching a movie trailer, you know you're watching a movie trailer But when you see these random images on the internet of Washington, D.C.

750
00:47:24,913 --> 00:47:29,757
[SPEAKER_01]: looking all destroyed It's kind of scary if you don't know what it is, you know what I mean?

751
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:31,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

752
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:38,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this game may not be as cool as Fallout 3, but definitely one that I'm looking forward to.

753
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:40,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Splatterhouse, the brand new remake.

754
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:43,732
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some interesting features that they've been talking about.

755
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:53,041
[SPEAKER_02]: One of which is the fact that your limbs can basically be taken off, but after a short bit they will actually regrow back.

756
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:56,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool and very detailed.

757
00:47:56,824 --> 00:48:03,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess instead of like a health system, your skin will start coming off, then your flesh, and then your bones will break.

758
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:06,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that stuff will kind of just grow right back.

759
00:48:06,913 --> 00:48:07,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds lovely.

760
00:48:07,974 --> 00:48:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

761
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:09,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And then apparently...

762
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:18,695
[SPEAKER_02]: The Killzone script writer, Gordon Rennie, and I guess he did Judge Dredd and the Necronauts comics.

763
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:22,938
[SPEAKER_02]: He's signed on to do the story for this game as well.

764
00:48:23,058 --> 00:48:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

765
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And the graphics on it so far look pretty good and very bloody.

766
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:32,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like the original.

767
00:48:33,045 --> 00:48:34,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, violence!

768
00:48:35,027 --> 00:48:35,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I like violence.

769
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:37,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Violence is fantastic.

770
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:38,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And sells stuff.

771
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:41,579
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura should get in panties and do the hula hoop game No

772
00:49:08,223 --> 00:49:09,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding, I'm not actually going to do that.

773
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:13,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Little creepy!

774
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:14,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Little creepy!

775
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on.

776
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:19,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about Metal Gear Solid 4.

777
00:49:19,435 --> 00:49:23,839
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of referenced this earlier because Konami's telling some people to put a lid on it.

778
00:49:25,404 --> 00:49:28,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Minor, minor spoilers here from Metal Gear Solid 4.

779
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:33,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't want to know, skip ahead in the podcast by about a minute.

780
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,548
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are just minor spoilers.

781
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:35,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.

782
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:36,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.

783
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:44,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosemary from Metal Gear Solid 2 is supposed to make an appearance, as well as Mei Ling from Metal Gear Solid the original.

784
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,733
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to be some characters in Metal Gear Solid 4.

785
00:49:48,213 --> 00:49:54,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are looking forward to being reunited with some of your favorite females from Metal Gear history, there you go.

786
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:59,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can convince Mei Ling to get in her panties and play Wii Fit.

787
00:49:59,631 --> 00:49:59,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

788
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:01,733
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

789
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:03,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to write a letter to Konami.

790
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:04,424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

791
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:29,665
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually get it, I think, from PlayAsia for $28.

792
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:37,230
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are spoilers on the track listing, so if you don't want spoilers, then don't get it.

793
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:43,655
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you do get the limited edition of the game, you will get a copy of the soundtrack too.

794
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:53,547
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, for Bomani fans, fans of Konami's music game series, I did notice one familiar name showed up on the soundtrack.

795
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:57,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Soda Fujimori apparently contributed to a couple tracks too.

796
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did some of the remixes in Beatmania 2DX.

797
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:03,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little Konami connection there.

798
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,790
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

799
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami connection.

800
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:06,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

801
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:08,428
[SPEAKER_01]: One big happy family.

802
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:14,816
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of do that though with a lot of their soundtracks, especially like Contra and stuff has a lot of Konami artists on there.

803
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:18,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You always see Akira and Suda.

804
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Hulk Smash!

805
00:51:49,669 --> 00:51:51,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the only reason I'd buy this game.

806
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to not suck that bad, but, you know, we'll have to see.

807
00:51:55,834 --> 00:52:01,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, of course, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360, which looks pretty awesome.

808
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:08,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And also coming out on practically everything, Lego Indiana Jones.

809
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:10,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So that looks pretty cool.

810
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:14,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kung Fu Panda, yet another movie tie-in.

811
00:52:15,588 --> 00:52:17,249
[SPEAKER_06]: The trailer for that looks kind of funny, actually.

812
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I do and I don't want a game called Kung Fu Panda because on one hand it sounds really awesome and on one hand it sounds like a lot could go wrong.

813
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:29,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on a movie, right?

814
00:52:29,507 --> 00:52:30,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

815
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:36,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the Wii, there's Cabela's Trophy Bucks, which looks like crap.

816
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:40,635
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PSP, Hot Shots Golf Open T2.

817
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:46,579
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, Summon Night Twin Age, which looks like a pretty cool Atlus RPG.

818
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:51,613
[SPEAKER_02]: God of War PSP Bundle Grid on PS3, Xbox 360, PC The Grid

819
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:07,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

820
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:09,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well this game looks awesome.

821
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:12,081
[SPEAKER_02]: This game's probably a lot better than The Grid.

822
00:53:13,302 --> 00:53:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am surprised we haven't seen that come to home consoles.

823
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

824
00:53:17,746 --> 00:53:19,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they should make that for Xbox Live or something.

825
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:21,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here.

826
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:28,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, next Sunday, the Metallic Rose DS Lite will be coming out.

827
00:53:29,097 --> 00:53:30,138
[SPEAKER_05]: More colors, yay!

828
00:53:30,896 --> 00:53:33,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It's metallic pink-ish.

829
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:34,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's light-ish red.

830
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

831
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Replacing the normal pink.

832
00:53:41,604 --> 00:53:44,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So now everyone's going to go scramble over themselves to get that?

833
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:46,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, yes.

834
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:48,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait.

835
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:48,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Special.

836
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:52,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's talk about what's coming out in Japan overseas.

837
00:53:52,966 --> 00:54:02,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming out on June 5th for the Xbox 360, FIFA Street 3 as well as Ninja Gaiden 2 finally makes its way out in Japan on the Xbox 360.

838
00:54:02,513 --> 00:54:08,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Going over to the PlayStation 3, Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit makes its way as well as another port of FIFA Street 3.

839
00:54:10,218 --> 00:54:19,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we head on over to the Nintendo Wii, Fushugi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 3, Karakuri Yashiki no Nemuri Hime.

840
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:23,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what that game is, but it's being made by Sega.

841
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, it is an RPG.

842
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:26,573
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all I know.

843
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:28,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to see if we have any screenshots of this game.

844
00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:29,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly we do not.

845
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:30,557
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have box art.

846
00:54:31,462 --> 00:54:34,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the guy looks like he has a little ferret as a companion.

847
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:36,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Ferrets are great!

848
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:37,727
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be a winner already.

849
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:38,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the box art.

850
00:54:38,888 --> 00:54:39,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see.

851
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Shirin the Wanderer.

852
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a series that's ran since Saturn, I want to say.

853
00:54:45,954 --> 00:54:48,456
[SPEAKER_02]: They just had one that came out on the DS in the US.

854
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's Shirin the Wanderer 3 then.

855
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:53,239
[SPEAKER_01]: But dude, he's got a little ferret companion on his shoulder.

856
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:54,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dungeon crawler.

857
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So did Beastmaster.

858
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:56,262
[SPEAKER_05]: He had two ferrets.

859
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:01,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we endorse any game with ferrets in it.

860
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: That we do.

861
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

862
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:03,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, ferret!

863
00:55:04,657 --> 00:55:05,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying.

864
00:55:06,257 --> 00:55:07,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the ferret is.

865
00:55:08,158 --> 00:55:08,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Hide it.

866
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:10,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Give.

867
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:11,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

868
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:12,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

869
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:14,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

870
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:16,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to other Japanese releases.

871
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:17,599
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it for the Nintendo Wii.

872
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:21,440
[SPEAKER_01]: On the PlayStation 2, Ukuki is coming out.

873
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,180
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

874
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukuki.

875
00:55:24,261 --> 00:55:25,401
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say all the time.

876
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:26,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukuki.

877
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:28,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's that.

878
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:33,761
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an adventure game from Global A Entertainment.

879
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:35,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And no screenshots or nothing.

880
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:37,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you exactly what this game is.

881
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,745
[SPEAKER_01]: But the box art is very artistic.

882
00:55:39,245 --> 00:55:40,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks kind of hand-drawn almost.

883
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:42,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukuki.

884
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:48,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Yamasod, DG World, Collaboration SP, Pachislot Ridge Racer.

885
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:52,062
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just imagine what that is.

886
00:55:52,142 --> 00:55:54,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just leave it at that.

887
00:55:55,525 --> 00:55:56,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Pachinko for Ridge Racer.

888
00:55:57,667 --> 00:55:59,209
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pachinko slot machine.

889
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,592
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Nintendo DS, Deep Aquarium.

890
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:06,026
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Deep Aquarium?

891
00:56:06,286 --> 00:56:07,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what it sounds like.

892
00:56:07,507 --> 00:56:08,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aquarium.

893
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:09,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be damned.

894
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:09,947
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

895
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:12,208
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it looks like the bottom.

896
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:14,988
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Titanic imagery there on the cover.

897
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:16,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Titanic Aquarium.

898
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:20,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you too can take care of your frozen corpses.

899
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:24,310
[SPEAKER_01]: At first I thought it was an insane aquarium, but I was sadly mistaken.

900
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing this week on the Sony PSP.

901
00:56:27,271 --> 00:56:28,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, PSP fans in Japan.

902
00:56:28,831 --> 00:56:30,872
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it for release dates overseas in Japan.

903
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:39,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back to a different side of overseas, we have our UK release dates, and there's not a whole bunch of stuff, but hey, it's stuff still.

904
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: One that Rob would probably be interested in.

905
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:48,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say really quick, HitStun has played that series of games, and it is a ferret.

906
00:56:53,142 --> 00:57:08,994
[SPEAKER_06]: On DS comes Etrian Odyssey, Everybody's Golf 2 for PSP, Lego Indiana Jones for a whole crap ton of everything else, Mass Effect on PC, Ninja Gaiden 2, Xbox 360, and Civilization Revolution for Rob.

907
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:13,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray!

908
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:19,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Except I heard it got pushed back here in America at the very last minute, so I'm wondering if the same thing didn't happen over in Japan.

909
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:20,339
[SPEAKER_01]: It only got pushed back a week.

910
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:21,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Or over in Europe.

911
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,421
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the second week in July.

912
00:57:23,802 --> 00:57:24,642
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's more than a week.

913
00:57:24,662 --> 00:57:25,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be out the first week in June.

914
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:27,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be the first week in... Oh, yeah.

915
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be out the first week of June in...

916
00:57:31,534 --> 00:57:33,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew about that a long time ago.

917
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:34,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got delayed like a couple days ago.

918
00:57:35,057 --> 00:57:35,537
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't.

919
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:37,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been that date for a long time.

920
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:38,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's when I heard about it.

921
00:57:38,139 --> 00:57:39,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people just didn't know about it.

922
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also a bunch of good stuff, though, coming out this month.

923
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:44,944
[SPEAKER_01]: If Europe gets that, too, I'm going to cry because I love Civilization.

924
00:57:44,984 --> 00:57:53,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually probably going to get this game because it seems like it really simplified what was becoming a very... Oh, God, I sound so dumb and babyish when I say this.

925
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to get it for the 360 or DS?

926
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:55,912
360.

927
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:57,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Achievements.

928
00:57:57,873 --> 00:57:58,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

929
00:57:58,593 --> 00:57:59,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Achievements.

930
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:00,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I said.

931
00:58:01,256 --> 00:58:01,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

932
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:02,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And Xbox Live.

933
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:03,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming there's something for Xbox Live.

934
00:58:05,158 --> 00:58:05,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember CivNet?

935
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:06,699
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was the shit.

936
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:07,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I love CivNet.

937
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,562
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could find a copy of CivNet that still worked, I'd actually probably play it.

938
00:58:11,122 --> 00:58:11,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

939
00:58:13,644 --> 00:58:13,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

940
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:14,524
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

941
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:19,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Akuma, JP, and Chat, by the way, just linked the official website for that game.

942
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:24,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he actually lives in Japan, so he knows a little bit about some of the releases going on over there.

943
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:25,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he going to get the gardening game?

944
00:58:26,432 --> 00:58:26,772
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing.

945
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:28,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is he going to get the gardening game?

946
00:58:28,513 --> 00:58:29,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I somehow doubt it.

947
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:36,860
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you really want the gardening game, you can just do a Japanese account and buy them.

948
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:39,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to news.

949
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if gardening's not your thing, then perhaps Red vs. Blue is your thing.

950
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:50,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And Red vs. Blue just released their brand new series, Reconstruction.

951
00:58:51,046 --> 00:58:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's a little bit more serious and less funny than the original.

952
00:58:56,548 --> 00:58:58,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's not even really that funny at all, but...

953
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:00,769
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

954
00:59:28,462 --> 00:59:57,616
[SPEAKER_01]: which of course is set in Halo 3 very nice well one of these days there ought to be a Halo movie I know that's been all going back and forth and video game movies seem to be all the rage right now and now throwing their hat into the ring Brett Ratner he's a pretty famous Hollywood director he did the Rush Hour trilogy he did the third part in the X-Men series so take that however you want so do we stab him with our plastic knives yet?

955
00:59:58,147 --> 00:59:59,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember watching the first episode and saying, this is lame.

956
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,120
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

957
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched the first episode too and went, this is lame.

958
01:00:19,302 --> 01:00:26,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, here's the thing is that apparently he is saying that he's going to be getting into gaming.

959
01:00:26,787 --> 01:00:30,089
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he'll, quote, be doing movies that come from video games.

960
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,133
[SPEAKER_01]: He also is mentioning that he has ties to the Activision catalogs.

961
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:38,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So possibly Call of Duty.

962
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:39,175
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be lame.

963
01:00:39,675 --> 01:00:40,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Soldier of Fortune.

964
01:00:40,756 --> 01:00:41,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

965
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see it.

966
01:00:42,277 --> 01:00:43,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero, the movie.

967
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:46,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see them doing something original, but Call of Duty, I mean.

968
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,001
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

969
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:14,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard a rumor that he's probably that he may be doing the God of War movie.

970
01:01:15,127 --> 01:01:16,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard a rumor that he sucks.

971
01:01:18,672 --> 01:01:18,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor?

972
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that may be fact.

973
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:26,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Geekboy2424 says, like the Zelda movie, please make it happen.

974
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:27,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, please, please.

975
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,433
[SPEAKER_01]: In true fanboy fashion.

976
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that IGN thing good enough?

977
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:33,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that was all that there needs to be.

978
01:01:33,615 --> 01:01:36,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the IGN thing is all you're ever going to get, probably.

979
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:38,837
[SPEAKER_01]: When has Nintendo ever... Oh, wait.

980
01:01:39,498 --> 01:01:45,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that back before it comes up because I remember I was going to say, when has Nintendo ever let any of their properties become movies?

981
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because for quite a while I had the Super Mario Bros.

982
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: movie erased from my memory.

983
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:52,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking that actually.

984
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:53,987
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just brought it back for all the rest of you.

985
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Dennis Hopper as Bowser?

986
01:01:55,868 --> 01:01:57,108
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't actually see that movie.

987
01:01:57,328 --> 01:01:57,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

988
01:01:57,889 --> 01:01:58,669
[SPEAKER_01]: John Leguizamo?

989
01:01:58,689 --> 01:01:59,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have not seen that movie.

990
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we need to have a movie night.

991
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,531
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

992
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:13,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of movies, before we get into the next story, Loki, you didn't talk about it during your gaming week, but you got to take a sneak peek at a recent movie, right?

993
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was screen number 14 for...

994
01:02:17,594 --> 01:02:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: for Postal.

995
01:02:19,075 --> 01:02:20,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I've been watching that.

996
01:02:20,796 --> 01:02:27,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We got legitimate screener copies at our place of employment and got to check it out.

997
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually watchable, I guess.

998
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:33,344
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to be controversial.

999
01:02:33,564 --> 01:02:38,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm just desensitized to a lot of this stuff or if it just really falls flat, but...

1000
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:42,380
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some funny parts.

1001
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:55,243
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part that I laughed at where he's at a job interview and they're asking him all these really stupid questions and then the very final question they ask him is this woman and she's like, what is the difference between a duck?

1002
01:02:58,964 --> 01:02:59,764
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes no sense.

1003
01:03:00,484 --> 01:03:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just blows up at her and his day kind of gets worse from there.

1004
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:06,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1005
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:10,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's funny parts, I guess, in it.

1006
01:03:10,462 --> 01:03:18,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a part where Uwe Boll gets his nuts blown off, and he falls down dead saying, I hate video games.

1007
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:19,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

1008
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:23,665
[SPEAKER_02]: But any time that he was on screen, he wasn't even funny.

1009
01:03:23,725 --> 01:03:27,686
[SPEAKER_02]: He was trying to be funny, you know, where, oh, I finance my movies with Nazi gold, huh?

1010
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I like children, huh?

1011
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it just wasn't very funny.

1012
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:32,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

1013
01:03:33,993 --> 01:03:39,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Other parts, like, there's a part where they use a cat as a silencer, and that was kind of funny, because it's just ridiculous.

1014
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:46,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's a lot of ridiculous stuff in it, and a lot of stuff, like, there's a... Well, Postal's a pretty ridiculous game, too.

1015
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:55,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, there's a gunfight where all, you know, it seems like the only people getting killed brutally is, like, children, you know, so I guess that... That's kind of sick.

1016
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:59,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a part in the beginning, you know, where they're arguing about, you know, the...

1017
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: How many virgins are going to get when they blow up a plane and stuff?

1018
01:04:03,895 --> 01:04:05,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, 9-11, ha, funny.

1019
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:07,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1020
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, like some other movies I've seen that have tried to be controversial, it doesn't really work.

1021
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:17,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sort of is, I guess, but it's not like, oh my god.

1022
01:04:18,072 --> 01:04:18,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1023
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:34,676
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1024
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,841
[SPEAKER_01]: But not quite as funny

1025
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:09,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth like a dollar rental or something like that.

1026
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:12,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would maybe check it out just to say you've seen it.

1027
01:05:13,197 --> 01:05:16,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect it to be very controversial or anything like that.

1028
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:21,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's parts that they just get ridiculous with, like, you know, full frontal Dave Foley and stuff like that.

1029
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just... I don't know.

1030
01:05:25,646 --> 01:05:30,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of works, but at the same time, it's just really ridiculous and very low budget, I guess.

1031
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:31,690
[SPEAKER_01]: With...

1032
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:37,167
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Janai in chat says Postal equals the Razzie movie of the year.

1033
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:39,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the Razzies will even remember this movie?

1034
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:41,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it deserves a Razzie.

1035
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:48,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as it is, it's 13 screens that it's on.

1036
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's a lot better than the 4 that was originally thought it was supposed to be on.

1037
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:53,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1038
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:57,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to see it just so I can understand for myself how...

1039
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming out for a while on DVD.

1040
01:06:01,675 --> 01:06:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that far away, but not for a few months.

1041
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:07,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'd like to view.

1042
01:06:09,327 --> 01:06:11,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's keep moving with the news.

1043
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our listeners want to break so they can go to the bathroom.

1044
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:16,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people do want that, don't they?

1045
01:06:18,254 --> 01:06:25,136
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, another series that has a pretty good following is the Brothers in Arms series.

1046
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:39,019
[SPEAKER_06]: There is actually a book that was put out, a novelization, that covers two of the days that weren't covered in the ten days of the operation that the game covers.

1047
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, the game itself was for when...

1048
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: The Allies were trying to seize a bridge in the Netherlands in 1944.

1049
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:57,423
[SPEAKER_06]: But now there's also talks about there being a movie based off of the Hell's Highway thing.

1050
01:06:57,443 --> 01:06:58,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be pretty cool.

1051
01:06:58,643 --> 01:06:59,503
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that could work.

1052
01:06:59,844 --> 01:07:06,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers in Arms actually has characters and a story that it follows instead of just war, war, war, war, shoot, shoot, kill, kill, Nazi dead.

1053
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:07,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1054
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:10,737
[SPEAKER_06]: They have material to work with.

1055
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a good source.

1056
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:24,484
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the biggest things that bugs me about... Yeah, but Saving Private Ryan, it's not... One of the things that bugs me about movies made from video games is where they take...

1057
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:26,641
[SPEAKER_06]: SILENT HILL

1058
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thrown her off the cliff myself.

1059
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:54,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she just said it twice.

1060
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:55,983
[SPEAKER_01]: But low, and that was a lot.

1061
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:57,884
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it she had her dream?

1062
01:07:57,944 --> 01:08:02,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to point out, Silent Hill did have Pyramid Head ripping somebody's skin off, so it did deliver.

1063
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,467
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the fan service.

1064
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:05,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1065
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:08,668
[SPEAKER_06]: He made the shouty bitch shut up.

1066
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:11,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And the very end of it, too, when they killed the Borg Queen.

1067
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:13,430
[SPEAKER_01]: They need Silent Hill 2.

1068
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:14,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyramid Head rapes everyone.

1069
01:08:15,214 --> 01:08:15,615
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1070
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:17,239
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1071
01:08:17,499 --> 01:08:18,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I need dream movies.

1072
01:08:19,123 --> 01:08:20,065
Oh my god.

1073
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,207
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1074
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:23,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Pyramid Head gets set loose on the streets of San Diego.

1075
01:08:24,272 --> 01:08:25,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill 6 The Roommate

1076
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:58,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually have where it could be like a comedy, like a sitcom, you know, where some guy ends up getting this roommate because he needs an apartment and can't find any other places to rent.

1077
01:08:58,684 --> 01:09:01,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And that roommate happens to be Pyramid Head.

1078
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:02,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, hilarity ensues.

1079
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:06,186
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like it would be a cheesy YouTube series.

1080
01:09:06,206 --> 01:09:06,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head.

1081
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:09,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, you're leaving skins of corpses around.

1082
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

1083
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:10,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Take WD-40 to that rusty head

1084
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

1085
01:09:36,398 --> 01:09:37,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but no.

1086
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Paint a face on it like Jack.

1087
01:09:39,739 --> 01:09:43,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you realize I'm going to go home and draw this now, right?

1088
01:09:44,401 --> 01:09:44,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dear.

1089
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:47,502
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, but no, but do you get my point?

1090
01:09:48,762 --> 01:09:48,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1091
01:09:49,223 --> 01:10:00,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that if they're taking something that there are already an established fan base for, I understand wanting to get more people than just the fan base to see it, but they need to stay true to their core material.

1092
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,107
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm actually kind of...

1093
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:09,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling actually kind of good about them doing a movie for this series because you've got something established and easy to work with, I think.

1094
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:14,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that there's not really too much room to fuck it up unless you let, you know, Uwe Boll do it.

1095
01:10:14,993 --> 01:10:16,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see what happens.

1096
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:26,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't really know how to translate, or I should say, kind of move over to this story, but hey, let's talk about something completely different, I guess.

1097
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:28,273
[SPEAKER_02]: How about something local?

1098
01:10:28,634 --> 01:10:29,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something local.

1099
01:10:29,754 --> 01:10:30,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Local news.

1100
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:30,594
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1101
01:10:31,115 --> 01:10:34,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently someone is acknowledging Stockton, California.

1102
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:35,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1103
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:36,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1104
01:10:36,617 --> 01:10:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Because apparently they wrote an article about, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 and how it's making people crazy.

1105
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, according to the Stockton record...

1106
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,761
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a couple quotes here.

1107
01:10:49,121 --> 01:11:02,146
[SPEAKER_02]: My son Peter was never really aggressive, but once he got into the video games, GTA being one of them, he started to push, hit, talk back, and just become a different person, said Stockton parent Greg Within.

1108
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:03,847
[SPEAKER_02]: His last name is Within.

1109
01:11:03,987 --> 01:11:04,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.

1110
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:09,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't really say how old his son is.

1111
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people that are letting their 8-year-old son play these games, so...

1112
01:11:13,876 --> 01:11:39,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty 4 I don't get it and then anyways there's another one this other guy who's 19 said he was involved in an altercation a week after he purchased Grand Theft Auto 4 he says at the time he noticed that he had become less sensitive to violence Grand Theft Auto 4 tearing a neighborhood apart and the 19 year old says it didn't completely blame the game for his violence but it did affect him

1113
01:11:40,413 --> 01:11:40,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1114
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:41,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds retarded.

1115
01:11:42,054 --> 01:11:53,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's covered on GamePolitics and you can also find it at RecordNet.com which is the official Stockton newspaper's website.

1116
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:57,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Stockton is like the butthole of the Sacramento area.

1117
01:11:58,343 --> 01:11:59,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even Sacramento area.

1118
01:11:59,824 --> 01:12:05,487
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like... That space between Sacramento and LA that you drive down on the freeway.

1119
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:09,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Or worse yet, that space between Sacramento and Fresno.

1120
01:12:12,324 --> 01:12:16,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can blame Jesse... They do have a good arcade there, though.

1121
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Corona, as... The author of the original article.

1122
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:24,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as Grand Theft Auto 4, criticized by Stockonians.

1123
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:25,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Stockonians!

1124
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:27,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow!

1125
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:28,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what they call themselves?

1126
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:29,670
[SPEAKER_01]: That's retarded.

1127
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:32,811
[SPEAKER_01]: We should go to Stockton, why?

1128
01:12:49,485 --> 01:12:50,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't they have an S-Mart?

1129
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:51,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if we get to know.

1130
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:53,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they do have an S-Mart.

1131
01:12:53,628 --> 01:12:55,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to comment on it every time we go by there.

1132
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know something else?

1133
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:58,352
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually spell it out, Save Mart, now.

1134
01:12:58,532 --> 01:12:58,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shoot.

1135
01:12:59,012 --> 01:13:08,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know something that's pretty funny, though, too, is this story right here is basically written about the launch day of Grand Theft Auto 4, yet it's coming out a month afterwards.

1136
01:13:08,979 --> 01:13:10,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, talk about trying to fill space.

1137
01:13:12,162 --> 01:13:12,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1138
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:20,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, SSJ100 in chat says, I heard a mother say she got the game for her kid because he was being made fun of in school for not having the game.

1139
01:13:20,804 --> 01:13:21,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, the kid was 12.

1140
01:13:23,425 --> 01:13:24,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid.

1141
01:13:25,466 --> 01:13:27,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids don't get made fun of for anything.

1142
01:13:27,728 --> 01:13:32,951
[SPEAKER_02]: The color of their hair, their name, the clothes they wear, the way they walk, talk, behave.

1143
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:35,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get over it.

1144
01:13:36,013 --> 01:13:37,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That's school for you.

1145
01:13:37,494 --> 01:13:38,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

1146
01:13:38,174 --> 01:13:40,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some more Grand Theft Auto 4 related news.

1147
01:13:46,482 --> 01:13:50,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Benny Hill's coming to, uh, no, it's, uh, actually has to do with, uh, kind of an idiot.

1148
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:54,178
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with a 13-year-old boy...

1149
01:13:56,230 --> 01:14:01,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't give out his name because he's only 13, but if we could, he would win this week's Stupid Award.

1150
01:14:02,496 --> 01:14:06,339
[SPEAKER_01]: This is coming from the police, Paul Shastani.

1151
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:10,162
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a lieutenant of a Massachusetts police force.

1152
01:14:10,523 --> 01:14:21,352
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a male 13-year-old, and what he did, he stayed after class when other students had left the classroom, and then pulled an 11-inch knife on the teacher and asked for 20 bucks.

1153
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,792
[SPEAKER_01]: When the teacher refused, he lowered his demand to $1.

1154
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:26,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a dollar!

1155
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:33,320
[SPEAKER_01]: The teacher then took the knife from the student.

1156
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,503
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't explain how that happened, but the teacher was able to get the knife away from the student.

1157
01:14:36,563 --> 01:14:37,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like punched him.

1158
01:14:37,784 --> 01:14:38,865
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, no, here's the thing.

1159
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:49,674
[SPEAKER_01]: The police said the boy wanted to buy the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but his mother had refused to give him the money, so he came up with an alternate plan.

1160
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:54,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, why was the kid trying to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, dude?

1161
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:56,180
[SPEAKER_01]: That game's been out for like years.

1162
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he only has a PlayStation 2.

1163
01:14:59,432 --> 01:15:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently his mom's a bitch for not buying him any violent video games.

1164
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:07,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that makes sense, because I think it's cheaper now, so only $20 might cover that game.

1165
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:12,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it would, and it'd be slightly short with tax, so it sucks for him.

1166
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:19,417
[SPEAKER_01]: But the moral of the story is, this guy sucks, and his parents kind of suck for letting him get away with this.

1167
01:15:20,597 --> 01:15:21,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.

1168
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:29,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, whenever we hear these types of stories and get out stupid words, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

1169
01:15:29,852 --> 01:15:31,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get angsty, people die.

1170
01:15:31,993 --> 01:15:33,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and the FUs of the week happen.

1171
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is bad.

1172
01:15:41,099 --> 01:15:42,680
Here is justice.

1173
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,320
Here is punishment.

1174
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:46,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, San Andreas?

1175
01:15:46,202 --> 01:15:47,582
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucked up.

1176
01:15:49,103 --> 01:15:51,925
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't really think I'm angsty about anything right now.

1177
01:15:53,792 --> 01:15:54,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Make something up.

1178
01:15:56,154 --> 01:15:58,637
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to my digestive system.

1179
01:15:59,377 --> 01:15:59,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1180
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,161
[SPEAKER_06]: For killing me softly with Ipsong.

1181
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:05,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Roberta Flack.

1182
01:16:06,704 --> 01:16:07,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki.

1183
01:16:07,905 --> 01:16:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, F you to Monster Mini Golf.

1184
01:16:09,847 --> 01:16:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this chain of mini, indoor mini golf places.

1185
01:16:13,311 --> 01:16:16,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they opened one up here in Rancho Cordova.

1186
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:17,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna go there, does it suck?

1187
01:16:18,297 --> 01:16:18,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It does suck.

1188
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:23,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the Nimbus Winery.

1189
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my problem with it.

1190
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,202
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, they just put no thought into the course design whatsoever.

1191
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of goes around there in a giant maze.

1192
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:37,805
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no barriers from one hole to the next, so you don't know where one course begins and another one ends.

1193
01:16:38,526 --> 01:16:43,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And you practically have to search the course to find the hole that you're supposed to be knocking the ball into.

1194
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:50,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So they spent little time on the course, but they have all these cool props that are like all pneumatic and stuff like that that are really cool.

1195
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:55,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I mean, indoor mini golf in this area would be a fucking awesome idea.

1196
01:16:55,352 --> 01:16:57,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, why isn't anyone doing it right?

1197
01:16:57,513 --> 01:17:06,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I had the money to set up something like that, I would at least put a few seconds thought into the actual course instead of just throwing some shit together.

1198
01:17:07,678 --> 01:17:08,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be going back.

1199
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:14,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I give an F you to driving home at 2.30 in the morning and falling asleep at the wheel.

1200
01:17:15,412 --> 01:17:17,353
[SPEAKER_01]: But thankfully, somebody else was there to take over.

1201
01:17:17,393 --> 01:17:22,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't drive unsafe, but just F you to the fact that I thought I'd be able to stay up at night.

1202
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:22,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't.

1203
01:17:22,956 --> 01:17:23,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do it.

1204
01:17:24,577 --> 01:17:25,537
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to me being weak.

1205
01:17:26,704 --> 01:17:49,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one thing that we will not be giving an F you to because it's awesome is classic video games that we love and adore and we're about ready to wrap up part A but we can't do it until we pay some respect to our elders and we do that by asking the one and only DarkSakura to dig through the archives of games every week and pick out one of her favorites to be featured as the OLR Classic Game of the Week.

1206
01:17:49,656 --> 01:17:51,737
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what should the kids be checking out this week?

1207
01:17:52,859 --> 01:18:02,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little game called Ghouls and Ghosts, also called Dai Makai Mura, which is really, really, you know, it's Ghouls and Ghosts.

1208
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:03,602
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you go wrong with that?

1209
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:04,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's classic.

1210
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:06,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence, classic game of the week.

1211
01:18:07,223 --> 01:18:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1212
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:10,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the music is the best.

1213
01:18:13,164 --> 01:18:13,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1214
01:18:23,604 --> 01:18:41,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyway, you play as a knight called Arthur who has to go through a bunch of really friggin' tough stages to go rescue his woman and save a soul by Lucifer.

1215
01:18:42,392 --> 01:18:46,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's funny that his bride is named Princess Prin Prin.

1216
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:47,974
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really hilarious.

1217
01:18:48,454 --> 01:18:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you pick up different weapons on the way.

1218
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, this is a sequel to Makai Mura, which was Ghosts and Goblins over here.

1219
01:18:55,859 --> 01:19:02,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And the change between this one to the last one is that you can fire up and jump and fire.

1220
01:19:05,025 --> 01:19:06,306
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also get different weapons.

1221
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Never use the sword.

1222
01:19:07,947 --> 01:19:08,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

1223
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:11,171
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get the lances.

1224
01:19:11,471 --> 01:19:12,072
[SPEAKER_06]: The holy water.

1225
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:12,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1226
01:19:13,372 --> 01:19:22,475
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, you've also got different enemies that show up, like, you know, a bunch of demon-y things, and a magician that every so often will either turn him into an old man or a duck.

1227
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:24,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1228
01:19:24,376 --> 01:19:31,578
[SPEAKER_06]: You also get, you know, your gold armor, so you get your charge attack and one extra, I guess, hit that you can take.

1229
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:36,060
[SPEAKER_06]: The really hard part about this game is that you do have a limited number of hits you can take.

1230
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:36,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1231
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1232
01:19:54,639 --> 01:19:59,285
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally just collapse into skulls and bones, which is kind of funny.

1233
01:19:59,385 --> 01:20:10,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Amiga, Armstrong, CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Saturn, which I have that copy and I actually bought it at a Babbage's.

1234
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:20,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bought it at an American retailer, I think it's hilarious, because it was only on the Capcom Generations that they brought out in Japan.

1235
01:20:20,852 --> 01:20:28,678
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on PlayStation Super Graphics, Master System, Genesis, Virtual Console release, and the ZX Spectrum.

1236
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:35,222
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really freaking fun, and also this game, and I'm going to spoil it for everyone.

1237
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only been out, you know, 20 years.

1238
01:20:38,064 --> 01:20:40,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's been out 20 years, it was released in 19...

1239
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, as of December, it will be out 20 years.

1240
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:43,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1241
01:20:44,568 --> 01:20:45,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released in December 1988.

1242
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:50,551
[SPEAKER_06]: But... I had a point.

1243
01:20:52,713 --> 01:20:53,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1244
01:20:54,033 --> 01:20:57,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to spoil the ending, when you get to the end of the game, you have to do it again.

1245
01:20:57,115 --> 01:20:58,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, guess what?

1246
01:20:59,096 --> 01:21:01,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember all that sweating that you did to get through this game?

1247
01:21:02,638 --> 01:21:03,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We lied.

1248
01:21:03,178 --> 01:21:03,698
[SPEAKER_06]: No ending.

1249
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:04,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it again.

1250
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:08,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you have to go through the whole thing all over again.

1251
01:21:09,742 --> 01:21:10,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadistic.

1252
01:21:11,162 --> 01:21:13,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, really evil.

1253
01:21:14,644 --> 01:21:21,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It also did have a sequel to it, which in my opinion was disappointing with Super Ghouls N' Ghosts.

1254
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:28,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It did have a very epic opening, and it was really freaking hard, but I don't think that it was as much fun as this one.

1255
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:35,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the one that drove me crazy at E3 two years ago, hunting down, and then they kicked me off of playing it, was Ultimate Ghosts N' Goblins.

1256
01:21:36,674 --> 01:21:37,774
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a PSP release.

1257
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was actually really fun and just as frickin' hard as all the other of them.

1258
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:44,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So... That's your game.

1259
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:46,017
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the game.

1260
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:49,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can beat this game, you have a very big EP-ing.

1261
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:50,658
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can beat this game.

1262
01:21:50,678 --> 01:21:51,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I've beaten the game.

1263
01:21:51,518 --> 01:21:52,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your EP-ing is very big.

1264
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:55,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen my husband beat it on one credit.

1265
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:56,800
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.

1266
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen him beat a number of games on one... I've seen him beat R-Type on one credit.

1267
01:22:00,681 --> 01:22:01,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Yikes.

1268
01:22:01,932 --> 01:22:03,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, folks.

1269
01:22:03,893 --> 01:22:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghouls and Ghosts on like a million different systems.

1270
01:22:07,735 --> 01:22:08,496
[SPEAKER_01]: So, check it out.

1271
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:12,578
[SPEAKER_01]: The system you would urge, though, I'm sure has got to be the Sega one, right?

1272
01:22:12,858 --> 01:22:16,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Saturn has the Arcade Perfect version.

1273
01:22:17,241 --> 01:22:22,664
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you're going to get it for any of the home systems, and it says Virtual Console as well, get the Genesis version.

1274
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:24,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, for any of the...

1275
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:28,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mind the Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

1276
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:34,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're not a fan, but... And honestly, and this is my problem because I was always a Super Nintendo fangirl.

1277
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:38,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually do like Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

1278
01:22:38,156 --> 01:22:39,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong at all.

1279
01:22:39,097 --> 01:22:40,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the game.

1280
01:22:40,178 --> 01:22:42,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it was a bit of a letdown.

1281
01:22:42,839 --> 01:22:43,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as good.

1282
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:49,183
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's comparing vanilla ice cream to chocolate peanut butter ice cream.

1283
01:22:49,203 --> 01:22:50,384
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's like taking like...

1284
01:22:51,611 --> 01:22:53,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold Stone vs. Soft Serve at McDonald's

1285
01:23:21,778 --> 01:23:22,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say it's that bad.

1286
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Soft-serving McDonald's tastes like whipped cream.

1287
01:23:26,019 --> 01:23:26,459
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1288
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go with the food again.

1289
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we've got to take a break.

1290
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,741
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost an hour and a half into the show.

1291
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:32,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I have ice cream at home, Rob.

1292
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:32,341
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1293
01:23:32,361 --> 01:23:35,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Medieval Madness, and I bought it because it's the same as a pinball machine.

1294
01:23:35,362 --> 01:23:37,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't eat ice cream right now.

1295
01:23:37,283 --> 01:23:37,983
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't eat low-fat ice cream.

1296
01:23:38,003 --> 01:23:43,024
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I can have, I have had a pretty awesome, there's a self-serve non-fat yogurt place over by William's house.

1297
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:47,166
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome because you get to make the yogurt yourself, and then they have toppings galore that you put on there.

1298
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:48,306
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a TCBY by my house.

1299
01:23:49,175 --> 01:23:49,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

1300
01:23:49,835 --> 01:23:51,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, look, we're going to take a break.

1301
01:23:52,317 --> 01:23:54,058
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned for more of Orange Launch Radio.

1302
01:23:54,078 --> 01:23:57,861
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even touch Nintendo Wii News and we got a whole lot of it coming up in the next segment.

1303
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:02,384
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of Xbox 360 news as well, even though it was a little slow in the house of Microsoft this week.

1304
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:05,686
