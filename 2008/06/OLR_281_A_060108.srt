00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, June 1st, 2008.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Could achievement like trophies be coming to PlayStation Network?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A homebrew version of Portal shows up on the DS.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And could a video game soon teach you to stop smoking?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And occasionally food.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me is always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I had a hamburger.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It was delicious.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My husband cooked it.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He had Worcestershire sauce cooked into it.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Every time I hear Worcestershire sauce I think of that one episode of South Park.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Forget it.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I watched the end of the Imaginationland episode.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That was kind of cool.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Worcestershire sauce was like a long time ago.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I had to do zombies.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Does that look like pink eye?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sorry.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If the Worcestershire sauce is cost you to become a zombie.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't remember what it was.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Forget it.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
My burger was great.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I have to tell everybody about this because it was really delicious.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I had wheat bun and a little bit of mayonnaise.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I put garlic on the bun.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Like chopped garlic.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And it was a delicious burger.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was tasty.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I also have Guinness but I don't think I like beer anymore.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Guinness isn't beer thankfully.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think I just lost my taste for a lot of alcoholic beverages.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For now.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I had a good food week too yesterday.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've had to really eat a lot of very bland low fat food.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks to the pancreas issues I had a couple weeks ago.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Whereas the bright side is I've lost almost 30 pounds now.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And haven't even had to play an ounce of Wii Fit.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The downside is I don't get to eat food I like.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But yesterday we were driving to the bay.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I got to go buy one of my favorite places in the entire world.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mary's Pizza Shack.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I love that place.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I actually ate like a pasta dish and the bread.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I seem to be okay.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I found something that I think you might be able to partake of at California Pizza Kitchen.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's that?

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it if you have them do light cheese on your pizza and get the wheat crust?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Might not be bad.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You should be able to get away with pizza every now and again.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But you can make it yourself.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I will give you recipes but not on the air.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes because we do have video games to get to.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Also say hello to the other co-host, Loki.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm three minutes into the show and I hadn't introduced you yet.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm so sorry but food, Loki, food.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm so tired today.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you tired?

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know why I just feel all drained.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Like I have no energy.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is it like lethargic tired?

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like I have a birthday coming soon.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm getting older.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I literally feel like I have no energy.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's weird.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Speaking of food, I saw this thing on the Food Network actually.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a local place.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's a dive called the Squeeze Inn.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think I have actually.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well they have a burger that's a third a pound of beef with a third a pound of cheese on it.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's just huge.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have to eat that.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That sounds like too much.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It literally is.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Like you have the patty and then there's like an extra inch of cheese around the outside.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is that a knife and fork burger?

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Alright, anyhow.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look, enough food.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright guys, I do want to introduce the ever present other host on our show.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You, the chatters.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to join our chat room.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Or of course you can wait until we open up the Skype line later in the show.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's our mailbag that's already pretty full this week.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But if you do want to send an email you can do that.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mailbag.OrangeLawnTrader.com

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I did peek in there a little bit at the mailbag and you can check it out during part B.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I noticed for the most part a lot of the emails are getting a lot shorter.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So props to our listeners.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's because Jamie gets laryngitis every time she tries to read them.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So it's good. We have some short emails this week.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So that's good.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I wanted to point out some comments in chat.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
At chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Dark Tetsuya was expressing surprise.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What? Jamie doesn't like beer anymore?

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wow.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not really so much that I don't like it.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's just that...

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll go ahead and say this right now.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In the past couple of weeks, like I was telling you earlier today,

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I've been having digestion problems of my own.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And beer has been making me very pained.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well alcohol is just bad for your digestion system in general.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It is.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I will probably not be able to drink alcohol for like a year if ever again.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think I mentioned this on last week's show.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But it's not the end of the world.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I found I'm okay with a little bit of wine.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But beer itself...

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can have like say a bottle of Newcastle.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can have a pint of Newcastle.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I'll feel uncomfortable by the time I'm done with it

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
when I used to be able to kick back a six pack all on my own with no problem.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Getting old sucks.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No. This has happened all within the last couple of weeks.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Amae Satsuma in chat says cheeseburger, one of our common chatters,

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
cheeseburger may have to change your name to Dark Sakura's poo in a few hours.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Gross.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's the other reason I actually ate my cheeseburger

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
is I'm experimenting with my food

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because I'm actually writing down everything I eat

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
so I can see what hurts.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Dark Sakura gave me that look of...

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why did you read that comment?

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Geekboy2424 says that he just recently watched the YouTube video this week

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
of Loki drunk playing Mario Kart.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Remember when we have a YouTube channel and there's things like that?

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That was you at your bachelor party quite some time ago playing Mario Kart drunk.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Good times.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm hoping that we'll have more things on YouTube soon.

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The bad news is that we have no webcam tonight.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's no Justin TV.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The webcam broke and so the audio doesn't work anymore

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and yeah, I can use the built-in speaker on the Mac

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but listening to last week's show, it sucked.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So here's the thing though.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've picked out the video camera I want to get

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and the good news is that the video camera can also double as a webcam

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but it can also be a video camera to go out and shoot more shenanigans.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You should get that one that they had at the lounge that all games used to be in

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
where they could control it and turn it and stuff.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, it's not a webcam. It's an actual video camera.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Remember, it's not porn unless you tape it.

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, and then I can also start my amateur porn studio with my new video camera.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, just kidding.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Alright, okay.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go ahead and get into How Was Your Gaming Week,

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
how we always like to start off the show even though we're like seven minutes into tonight's show.

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Poor. It was poor.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sorry to hear that.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Actually, I had drama this week.

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I had to kick a pinball machine to break into my own house.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Nice.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That story is for later but anyway.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've been getting on My Husband because he's supposed to be getting me The World Ends With You

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and every time he says he's going to do it,

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
oh, the store doesn't have it.

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So you can't go to another.

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, then I'll have to suffer.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Evil man.

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So The World Ends With Dan.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But, but, but, but, but I did have a really, really awesome game of World Cup soccer pinball.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Excellent.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And he's working on our Black Knight 2000. I'm so happy.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sweet.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You were telling me a funny story about Grand Theft Auto.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know if you want to talk about it now or later.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, fuck. Okay.

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's funny.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, I was watching Will play and Will is Dan's pretty much his best buddy.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
BFF.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Anyway, I was watching him play right before I left.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It just like as I was leaving with my hamburger in hand.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He was ordering from Burger King in the game.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And we were talking about shot or whatever the crap it is.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Burger hell.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So we were talking about falling down, though.

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know that movie?

188
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What was who is with Kurt Russell?

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Michael Douglas.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Michael Douglas.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Kurt Russell. Yeah, Michael, because we were watching that South Park episode.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Anyway, the Stargate thing, you know?

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Anyway, so we were making references to falling down and I was like,

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you should just shoot her.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He's like, no, I need my burger so I can regain my health.

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was like, well, then eat your burger and then shoot her.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So he gets his burger, holds out the gun and she's like, oh, shit.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I guess it's like they instantly go into this panic deer in the headlights look.

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I would do I mean, I've had a gun pointed at my face before.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I know the the thing.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And then he shoots her and then like five other people pull up behind him and pull out guns.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Like, I'm leaving. Bye.

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And then and then he also made a motorcycle appear from nowhere and promptly crashed it.

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And his friend landed on his head and we thought he died, but he got up.

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I was like, your friend's really thick.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I part of me does want to pick up Grand Theft Auto just for the lols alone and think in situations like that.

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I just I have this bad feeling it'll wear off quickly.

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I get more amusement watching other people play it.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You just have to remember, Grand Theft Auto is not usually my thing, you know, but I guess I really should.

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I enjoyed watching Loki play it, so I should probably get it.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We'll see. The multiplayer is probably fun, too.

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's see. What did somebody say in chat here?

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, SGA 100 Matt says Jamie gets into her house by playing pinball. Awesome security system.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
OK, OK, OK, OK. The story.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Real quick. I got locked out of my house yesterday.

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
OK, I have this little pouch on the side of my purse. I put my keys and then my keys fell out.

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I get outside, shut the security door.

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You make sure it's locked and then realize when I'm reaching in my purse, I do not have my keys on me.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And Dan can't leave the store to come help me in.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can't get a hold of anybody who either A has the keys to some part of my house or can take me to go get Dan's.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So I'm going around the house and I found out that one of the screens actually didn't have the little protective tab in it, which we are going to remedy.

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And I got the screen out, climbed up on this chair that we have outside for some unknown reason.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Had to contort to freaking get in the window because I'm still too short and slid down a pinball machine.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We know the only window that I could get in was the one that Dan has the no fear pinball backed up against.

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I had to actually push it.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then I was like, I'm too short to jump down from here because you know how tall those windows are in the pinball room.

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Right.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I made it down and then had to push the pinball machine back.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And I thought I broke a leg of the pinball machine, not mine.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I thought I broke my ankle though.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then it was just really bad.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've got everything back in order and now the house is once again impregnable.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But still.

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All right.

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Please, please do not be breaking into Dark Soccer's house.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OK, thanks.

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, because I'll kill you.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
All right.

239
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, with the fish.

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, I feel like more Grand Theft Auto 4.

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Of course.

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, I'm just working towards 100% stuff.

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Did you shoot anyone in the face?

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
All right.

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm pretty sure I did.

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Anyways, so I finished all the pigeons.

248
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I killed all the pigeons.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I did all the stunt jumps today.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And now I'm doing the random friends, I guess is what they call it.

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But it's random people you meet on the street.

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They have different missions.

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But I can't give this one the trigger because I think I passed it up somewhere.

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know.

255
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So that's kind of annoying because if I can't get the trigger, then I can't get 100%.

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And that would really suck.

257
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And then I played this game.

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a demo for a game called Crash Time because I thought, hey, this is going to be cool.

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's like a European game that looks really cheesy and it was cheap.

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And I tried it out and it's not very good.

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's basically like an arcade chase game.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are the police and you have to do different things like they'll have it where you have

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
to do 30% damage to the person you're chasing and make them stop for 3 seconds or something

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
like that.

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I tried that and I just didn't care for it.

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's kind of dumb.

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Nothing will replace my Earth Defense Force 2017.

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And then, let's see.

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know, actually I think that was about it for my gaming week.

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think I played anything else.

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Nice.

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Alright.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I played more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted to Warcraft.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Got it.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you.

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're welcome.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I would like to announce that our guild finally full cleared Karazhan this week.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We did a full clear of Karazhan.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You have to be a WoW nerd to understand what that means.

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So that's a full clear on Kara and one boss down in Zolomon.

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Considering there aren't 25 of us to run the big raids, we have to do the little raids,

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
it's great.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I'm very excited at the news that Wrath of the Lich King is going to have 10 man's

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
equivalent to every 25 man.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That makes me very happy.

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Anyhow, enough WoW nerddom.

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I did play some other games this week.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I downloaded a new game from the Steam service which, as you know, is kind of like PC's answer

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to Xbox Live, I guess you could say.

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's made by Valve.

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The company did the orange box and all that stuff.

294
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They sell a lot of other games on there, some independent games.

295
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I decided to check out Audiosurf.

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It had been recommended to me before because it's a music game, basically.

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You know, we here at Orange Toms Radio, we love music games.

298
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a big part of our history.

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I thought, why not?

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm going to check this out.

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So Audiosurf's kind of interesting.

302
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
From looks alone, I thought it was going to be a game like Amplitude just because it was

303
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
that whole traveling down a course with all the sci-fi looking things around.

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Kind of the very similar look to what you saw in frequency of Amplitude.

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But the gameplay itself was much different.

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The gameplay is more like, do you remember an old school puzzle game called Klax?

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
From the early 90's, that game Klax?

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
In Klax, there were these little things that would go down a conveyor belt, these little colored blocks.

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What you had to do is you had to put the colored blocks three in a row.

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Either across, down, or diagonally.

311
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's kind of what Audiosurf is, except it moves much faster and the colored blocks kind of go in time with music.

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But the music is any MP3 you want.

313
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's any MP3 you want or any iTunes file you want as long as it's not a protected file.

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You can't use iTunes purchase files, but you can use things that you've encoded in iTunes that aren't protected.

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And it plays a wide variety of stuff.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And it's kind of neat because the game does come with its own soundtrack.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It comes with the Orange Box soundtrack because, hello, it's Valve.

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So you can play Still Alive and Audiosurf to your heart's content.

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But here's one thing I thought was kind of interesting about Audiosurf.

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
As you're playing the game, in the results screen that comes up, it will still show you leaderboards for the song you played.

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
In other words, it doesn't matter what song you played from your library.

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The servers, I guess, keep track of all the file names or it must be some type of algorithm between file name and the way the music file was read by the game.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Probably the CD database, how they have those.

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Possibly, but it's not really playing off a CD either.

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But it'll take it off the MD5 hash or whatever.

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, kind of something like that.

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So I thought that was really cool because I played an Echo Image song, which Echo Image is kind of an obscure band unless you're really familiar with the DDR series.

328
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Or Synthpop in general.

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And to my surprise, there were a couple other people that had played the same song I did.

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I thought that was kind of neat the way they had the leaderboards in that game.

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And then you can have your own friends list and all that good stuff.

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And Steam has its own achievements-like thing that you can do in Audiosurf.

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But here's the other thing about Audiosurf is that not only did it have the clax-style gameplay, which is kind of cool because it reads the file in advance.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And the track is kind of like a giant roller coaster.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And during the really intense part of the songs, you're going straight downhill and you're going really fast.

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And you have to collect these blocks really fast.

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And then during the more slow build-up parts of the songs, like the song Skulk by Echo Image.

338
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
During that little tiny instrumental part, it's building up.

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm not going to try to sing it.

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're climbing uphill slowly and the blocks are coming in slowly.

341
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And then when it really builds up to the really hard part of the song.

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Understand me now.

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That whole part, you're going downhill like 100 miles an hour and you have to collect blocks really fast.

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Cool.

345
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's cool.

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But the thing is that you can pick different types of ships as well that you can control.

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And it kind of changes the core element of the game.

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Like if the clax thing is too confusing for you, there's like a simple ship that you can pick where the blocks are either gray or they're colored.

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And it is collect colored blocks, avoid gray blocks.

350
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It makes it very easy.

351
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And you can kind of step up the different types.

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Or you can do like a ship that will shuffle the colors occasionally.

353
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Or a ship where you can hold blocks.

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's kind of neat.

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I really enjoyed the game.

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The only thing is that I didn't think a lot of times the music making algorithm that made the tracks and the blocks wasn't often really in time with the music.

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're not going to have something as spot on as Beatmania 2DX or DDR or Rockband or any of those things that are pre-programmed for the songs in it.

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But I cut it a little slack because considering you can play any song in the world, there's only so much you can do to get it accurate.

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And for what it's worth, I did think the uphill downhill things, like it's very good at detecting lots of volume, little volume and kind of building the course that way.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So I give it props for that.

361
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I would recommend it to the game because it's only $10.

362
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So there you have it.

363
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And if you want to, you can hopefully hope that this game is going to come out on Xbox Live because there's rumors that the game might be coming out on Xbox Live.

364
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I think that's a really good place for it, is Xbox Live.

365
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But here's the problem.

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think the reason why it works so well as a PC game is the fact that you can use any MP3 you want or any song you want directly from your drive.

367
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes, on Xbox you can import your own music files, yeah.

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But do the masses really know how to do that?

369
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Probably not so much.

370
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So I don't know how successful the game would be on Xbox Live, but I'd still be all for it.

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I mean, it's not like there aren't other games that do use the extended soundtrack, every extended extra extreme.

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hello.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So there you have it.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's see, reading some commented chats.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Gold Banjo asks, Sky, can't people just edit the ID3 tags and cheat the leaderboards?

376
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Gold Banjo, I don't think so because the leaderboards are independent for each song.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't notice any type of comprehensive leaderboard.

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So if you edit the ID3 tag, then you're on a new song.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't even think it's the ID3 tag.

380
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think it maybe just, they have, I think it's called an MD5 tag where it.

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The way the algorithm's figured out is probably coded into some type of thing that is sent to the servers.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I have no idea.

383
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No idea.

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And really, are you cheating at a game that's like, I mean, come on.

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hitstun says, actually only looks at the artist and song title tags.

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No hash checking is done and people cheat by playing 20 minute songs tagged to look like other songs.

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, that's messed up.

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So maybe Audio Surf needs to.

389
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yay, cheating.

390
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Consider the length of the MP3 as well.

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That would probably be a good idea.

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So there you have it.

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So Audio Surf, I liked.

394
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And that was really the only new game I played this week.

395
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, I take that back.

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I played that new Sudoku game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

397
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's Sudoku, folks.

399
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I mean, really, if you haven't played Sudoku and you're a big Sudoku fan.

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Here's the thing.

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I've abstained by choice.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I give Xbox Live props for trying to put games out there that are going to appeal to other people than just hardcore gamers.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But I don't know if this is it.

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's okay.

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It'll be delisted soon.

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It'll be delisted in six months anyway.

407
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And then I played the Warlords game as well, which was, I'm sorry.

408
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I had a little more fun with that because I remember the old school Warlords game, but they really kind of changed it.

409
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And you can notice for yourself.

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Play the new, because you can do the demo.

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Play the evolved version versus the old version.

412
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The way it works is kind of different.

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The new version is more like Breakout, which, yeah, the old version was too, but the ways the castles were shaped were even different.

414
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And I don't know.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It just plays a lot differently and not as fast.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's weird.

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No thanks.

418
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I think I'll skip it.

419
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It was weird.

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I mean, at least it's only five bucks, and I bet Xbox Live is kind of fun.

421
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I think Warlords is one of those games you best remember as something that was at Chuck E. Cheese when you were a kid.

422
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And sadly, this one I'm noticing about a lot of the retro titles on Xbox Live.

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Like, I hate to say it.

424
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I hate to say it, but Discs of Tron.

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That was kind of disappointing to play on Xbox Live because that was one of those games that was best left in my childhood.

426
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What can you do?

427
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
All right.

428
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we'll get into tonight's news.

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Really only a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And that is that if you are unaware, our sixth anniversary show is coming up in three weeks, if you can believe it or not.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Orange Lounge Radio started on June 23rd of 2002.

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And so in about three weeks, we're going to be looking at our sixth anniversary show.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We have no idea what to do for our sixth anniversary.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
None.

435
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So if you have ideas, email them to us.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Don't shout them out in chat because I'll forget by tomorrow.

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But send us emails or I made a thread on our Facebook forums because people were saying I don't give Facebook enough love.

438
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So there you go.

439
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you go to Facebook and you look up the OL Army Club on there, we have a little thread going there, and I am watching it.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We're curious.

441
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What do you want to see us do for our sixth anniversary?

442
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And we'll see because the show has always been about the chatters and the listeners and interacting.

443
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So why not?

444
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We'll be your monkeys this anniversary within reason.

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, if the suggestion is naked show, that's probably not going to happen.

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Okay, Actif.

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We're not having a fuck show until we don't say we are.

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Exactly.

449
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The fuck show is a surprise.

450
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
First rule about fuck show.

451
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You don't talk about fuck show.

452
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And we haven't really made up any other rules beyond that because we have to have rules for that.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes.

454
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So somebody has to moderate and all that fun stuff.

455
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So we'll plan it.

456
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't worry.

457
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
No, that's the first thing.

458
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's for sure.

460
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Brad from Pod Culture says drunk fuck show.

461
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I can't get drunk right now because of everything else going on.

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
All right.

463
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Anyhow.

464
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay, give you some LSD.

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh, I could probably smoke pot.

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'd be okay.

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You could.

468
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Pots not fat.

469
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No, drugs are bad.

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay.

471
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Drugs are bad.

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

473
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
All right.

474
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Forget it.

475
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Please, Loki.

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Save the show from drug talk.

478
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
All right.

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This week there was an event being held in France for Ooby Days 2008 where they were

480
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
showing off a bunch of their titles and one that they showed off only in trailer form.

481
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And it was kind of at the closing of the conference.

482
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's Beyond Good and Evil 2.

483
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's being reimagined now for the next gen consoles and I'd imagine probably the PC as

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
well.

485
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And they had a little teaser trailer which you can see Uncle Page.

486
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So I don't know.

487
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It looks cool.

488
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I never really played the first Beyond Good and Evil.

489
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So I don't really know what to expect from this.

490
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Beyond Good and Evil is one of those really like cult hits kind of thing.

491
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So I know there's a lot of people very excited about this because I think a lot of people

492
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
didn't think it would ever happen.

493
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So there you have it.

494
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Looks good though.

495
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
All right.

496
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hopefully you'll probably find out more about this during E3.

497
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That little pig guy thing kind of scared me.

498
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Just so you know.

499
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Did you see the pictures of that?

500
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah.

501
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That was very scary.

502
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's Uncle Page.

503
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

504
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That scared me.

505
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

506
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Also coming to the PlayStation pretty soon because Beyond Good and Evil 2 is PS3, right?

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
All the next gen systems, right?

508
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

509
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I think so.

510
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, also coming to the PlayStation 3 sometime eventually will be home.

511
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Sony Home.

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, Ubisoft has announced that they are going to be doing something special for home.

513
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They are going to be doing one of their events online.

514
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Here's the thing.

515
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
In the PlayStation Home media and events space, they're going to be showing off all these

516
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
new Ubisoft titles.

517
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, HAWX, Hawks or whatever.

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah.

519
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Soulcalibur IV.

520
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But here's the thing.

521
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You can only get there if you have a closed beta account.

522
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Soulcalibur IV?

523
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's weird.

524
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

525
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That's not an Ubisoft title.

526
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's Namco.

527
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't know why that's on the list.

528
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I guess maybe that's sharing the space.

529
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Who knows?

530
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Huh.

531
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But whatever.

532
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There are these other games at least as well that are going to be in the space.

533
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Well, that's cool.

534
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

535
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Because I know right now it's only open closed or I should say it's closed beta right now.

536
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So those are the only people that are able to enjoy that.

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And prior to this, they did a recreation of the Sony, I think they call it PlayStation

538
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Day.

539
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So, they were kind of showing what it would look like for future events, which I think

540
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
is pretty cool that they have this whole interactive thing going on.

541
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's definitely a different way to approach it.

542
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Kind of interesting.

543
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I mean, since the rest of us can't go to E3 anymore because we're not in the cool kids

544
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
club, you know, we could go to E3 in home, which I think is kind of interesting.

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You know, the more I think of it, the more I don't really care that we're in the good

546
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
graces of publishers.

547
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Because we get to say whatever we want in the show.

548
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Exactly.

549
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't mind either.

550
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So, screw it.

551
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

552
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The hell with them.

553
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We can say something sucks as much as we want to.

554
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Exactly.

555
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And you know, if we want to review Metal Gear Solid 4 early, we can.

556
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So, Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake is old.

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And we'll talk about the hard drive space all we want.

558
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

559
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's probably why we don't have advanced screeners.

560
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah, that's probably why we don't get advanced screeners.

561
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Guess what's coming out, though, on the Japanese PlayStation Store.

562
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What?

563
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This is on the 26th of June.

564
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And when I read this, my response was, LOL what?

565
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They're doing a gardening game.

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's called Shiki Tei and basically you go outside and plant trees and plant flowers

567
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and watch them grow.

568
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And it's supposed to be 1600 yen and it's supposed to be relaxing for the older gamer.

569
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There's no word if we're ever getting it.

570
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But I was just like, what?

571
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And it made me think about the Saturn game that came out that was all audio.

572
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And it came with seeds.

573
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And it was supposed to help your plant grow.

574
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

575
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So, correct me if I'm wrong.

576
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Always.

577
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But you are saying now that I can use my PlayStation 3 to watch the grass grow.

578
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes.

579
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You don't even get the benefit of insects or animals to scamper through your garden

580
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and eat the leaves off of your petunias.

581
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Nice.

582
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You can plant cherry trees.

583
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why don't you just go plant real trees?

584
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Because real trees take forever to grow, Loki.

585
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You know how long a real tree takes to grow?

586
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Fuck long time.

587
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That's how long it takes.

588
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But in the world of video games, such as Animal Crossing,

589
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I can go to Jamie's neighborhood and chop down all her trees.

590
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You can also pull all my weeds up too.

591
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And they'll be back in three days.

592
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That's the beauty of video games.

593
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't know.

594
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
How about spend the 1600 yen on something better?

595
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Like tacos.

596
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't know.

597
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm sure you can find tacos in Japan.

598
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But if I had 1600 yen, I would just go be buying like maybe some Anpan or something.

599
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Anpan is delicious.

600
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm having a dream game brainstorm.

601
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What kind of video game could they make about tacos?

602
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They don't need any.

603
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Taco time.

604
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We don't need any dream games.

605
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's like a burger time.

606
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You get taco time.

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Listen, that's a great idea.

608
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No.

609
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They should remake burger time.

610
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Taco time.

611
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
No, we have too many dream games.

612
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We need to space this out.

613
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We can't be doing one every episode.

614
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's retarded.

615
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And taco time, come on.

616
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's a cheap ripoff.

617
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's lame.

618
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's not original.

619
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's stupid.

620
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But you also have to be graded on the artistry of your tacos.

621
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Besides, it's a taco.

622
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
No one likes tacos.

623
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Tacos are lame.

624
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I like tacos.

625
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I love chicken soft tacos.

626
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Tacos are not lame.

627
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You know what's lame?

628
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You're lame.

629
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Tacos are not lame.

630
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You know what's lame?

631
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Your butt.

632
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You know what's lame?

633
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
A gardening game on any system.

634
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No.

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's like viva piñata minus the piñatas.

636
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Or the viva.

637
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Or the viva, yes.

638
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Piñata fuerte.

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I had to cover that for the what the hell are they thinking.

640
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And it's only in Japan, right?

641
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Okay, it's a neat idea that they're putting out a game that's different.

642
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
For old people.

643
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
For old people that will buy practically anything, I guess.

644
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But 1600 yen, it seems.

645
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Or is it 1600 yen?

646
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah.

647
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That seems kind of expensive.

648
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's like seven bucks.

649
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That's still expensive.

650
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I mean, why am I saying seven bucks?

651
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's like maybe 1650.

652
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah, it's like 15 bucks about, right?

653
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay, that's lame.

654
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That game's worth a buck.

655
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's have T agrees.

656
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Taco Time would be an amazing name for a game.

657
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, honestly.

658
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
There's, okay, we won't officially add anything to the Dream Games list yet, but be thinking about Taco Time.

659
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
There's a game in there somewhere.

660
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
More tacos, less drives.

661
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You can do a remake of Burger Time and add other food to it.

662
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That you create other things.

663
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Not only burgers, but like other meals and stuff.

664
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Nah, bored now. Bored now.

665
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Well, that's because it was a bad idea anyway.

666
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So there's your Taco Time. Bad idea.

667
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I have a Dream Game.

668
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What?

669
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Action Bastard, the game.

670
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No. No Dream Games tonight.

671
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Unfortunately, one game that's not being included in the new firmware for the PS3 is Taco Time.

672
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But some other things are going to be added in there.

673
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And these are all, of course, rumors, but there's a lot of, I don't know, evidence to point towards it.

674
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So the rumor is that they're adding both the in-game cross-media bar, which is something that should have been there, I don't know, from the start.

675
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And trophies, which, you know, is Sony's way of saying,

676
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Hey, we like achievements, but how can we get around a lawsuit?

677
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So those will be coming very soon.

678
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,000
In fact, they have been spotted already in a video showing the new Bioshock for PlayStation 3.

679
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Apparently, a member of Mac's console forums has posted some images and video during, you know, Bioshock that they've found.

680
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So, interesting.

681
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But either way, you know these are coming because, you know, they've announced this previously.

682
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's just a matter of time.

683
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But then again, it could get delayed forever like Home has and everything else Sony-related, so.

684
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
All right.

685
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't know, do you think this is a good idea? Is this something PlayStation needs?

686
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, sure. I mean, because I know achievements have gotten me to play games I probably wouldn't normally play.

687
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So, I mean, it's only a good thing for them.

688
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I think, I mean, sure we'll get over it, but right now, since we haven't gotten over it yet, I still think it's a cheap ripoff.

689
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But, you know, more power to them, I guess.

690
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
By the way, I got a private message from Cheeseburger in Chat who's suggesting that Taco Time could be like Taco Mama instead of Cookie Mama, Taco Mama.

691
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
No, it would be Cookie Mama junk food edition.

692
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Besides, they do have a restaurant called Taco Time, so.

693
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Let's have Tia saying, Is everyone else seriously missing the sexual euphemism?

694
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm not at all.

695
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Now maybe there's the game.

696
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
But that would be fish Taco Time.

697
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That could be the bonus stage.

698
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
All right, forget it. Enough about tacos.

699
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
No.

700
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's actually an in-joke amongst me and some other people.

701
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Forget it.

702
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Okay.

703
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Now they're talking about muffins. What's up with that?

704
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Muffins are also sexual.

705
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Muffins!

706
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Banana muffins.

707
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Blood muffins.

708
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Blood muffins.

709
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Forget it.

710
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Have you seen the YouTube thing about it? Forget it.

711
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Anyhow, the PlayStation 3 game End War is going to be getting some very interesting types of controls.

712
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Gesture activated commands are coming soon to the End War game, which is a Tom Clancy game.

713
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Here's the thing. You actually use the PlayStation Eye to do it.

714
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And you can wave your hands, like if you wave your hand underneath the camera, then you get the game's overhead map.

715
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And I don't know, it's kind of different here.

716
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So it's just something that I guess incorporates the eye into the game so you can use gestures to move around.

717
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because waving your hands around is the next gen of gaming, in case you haven't heard.

718
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah, that's why Para Para Paradise really took off, huh?

719
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Strangely enough, nothing about a 360 equivalent because there is that whole vision camera.

720
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But no word yet about that.

721
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The camera sucks and the PlayStation Eye is supposed to be a little bit more detailed.

722
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
How much different are they really, besides maybe resolution?

723
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't know. I know my vision camera hasn't been used ever since I got it.

724
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I took my picture with it and I was about as far as I went.

725
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Oh, and I tried playing Totem Ball and then that sucked too.

726
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But the PlayStation Eye, I guess it's a good use of it.

727
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Although I'd rather see those other games that they had that they were showing off little tech demos for.

728
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But hey, I mean, if you want some crappy use for a $30 camera, then sure.

729
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Let's just make it so I can wave my hand under the camera instead of, I don't know, pushing a button.

730
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Because what's easier? I mean, seriously, if we're going to be lazy here, pushing a button or waving your hand?

731
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I think pushing the button.

732
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Well now, just so you know, this is still in development and may not actually make the final cut of the game.

733
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's just something that's being played with right now, so we will see.

734
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I always think it'd be like gesture control, like flipping off the enemy or something.

735
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Well now, if they had it where you're actually, because the article referred the control to being similar to Total Recall.

736
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Or not Total Recall, Minority Report. Why the hell? Wrong movie there.

737
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Anyways, so if it was more like that where you're actually using your hands to move a map around and stuff like that,

738
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
that'd be kind of cool, but just to wave your hand to bring up a map is kind of stupid.

739
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Solely907 is commenting on the previous story about the firmware.

740
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Once firmware 2.4 comes out, the PlayStation Network becomes on par with Xbox Live.

741
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Xbox Live is still slightly better, but not enough to justify $50 anymore. Agree or disagree?

742
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I wouldn't agree, because I still think as far as content that's on there, there's a lot less content on the PlayStation Network.

743
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I mean, download content's a little on par, especially with some of the games that are coming out in both systems.

744
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But as far as original games and new PlayStation Network games, there really hasn't been that many that have come out.

745
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's not every week like Xbox Live Arcade.

746
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
True, although I do think maybe it's time for Xbox Live to get a little price cut, but who knows.

747
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But they do tend to update a lot more.

748
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I think they should too, especially since they're advertising on there, so I don't pay a monthly subscription to watch ads.

749
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
When has that ever stopped other games from doing the same thing?

750
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah. Now they're talking about motion-based games in chat. They're talking about Power Power Paradise and all this stuff.

751
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
CrunkyBoyJunior says they should have a spinoff of the Wii Fit hula hoop game where you put cymbals in your ass.

752
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm not really sure how that works, but okay.

753
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Speaking of Wii Fit and the hula hoop game, I doubt you've seen this dark soccer, but Loki, did you see the YouTube this week?

754
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It was posted on Dig. It was some guy taping his girlfriend playing the Wii Fit hula hoop game.

755
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But here's the thing. She was a nice looking gal, and she had a nice little booty on her, right?

756
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
She was wearing nothing but panties. Well, she was wearing panties and a t-shirt.

757
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And the thing is that while she's playing the hula hoop game, the boyfriend zooms in on her butt.

758
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And put it on the internet for everybody to see, and now it's everywhere.

759
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And at the very end of the video, the guy puts the camera on himself, and he gives one of those, like, yeah type of looks.

760
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If you haven't seen it, it's hilarious. It'd be so dumped.

761
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm gonna find it. Yeah, that's happening for real. I can't believe you guys haven't seen it.

762
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm gonna find it. No. I will play it in the studio after the next one.

763
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't really look at Dig anymore because, well, especially their gaming topics, I've already seen most of that stuff by the time.

764
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There's a lot of crap on there, but there's some decent stories that sometimes slip under the radar, like this one.

765
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So I'll find it on YouTube for you guys while we cover the next story.

766
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
How is that decent? That sounds indecent.

767
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Well, I have something more decent. It has to do with the PAL PSN update of Stuff-ness.

768
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They got something good. Like, one good thing.

769
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:57,000
They got Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix for matchingservice.com with more suffixes to the end of it.

770
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's so cute. I love that game.

771
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Ooh, that's awesome. Only a few months late.

772
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Hey, it's £6.99 over there, so everyone download it.

773
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They also have Rayman on the PS3 and PC store for PSP for £3.49.

774
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Also, Medieval Resurrection for PSP out for £14.99.

775
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And Go Sudoku Packs at £1.99. Or you can download the whole thing for £4.99.

776
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And the Army of Two Veteran Map Pack.

777
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There's also Prince of Persia wallpaper. Like, you care, but hey.

778
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So that's all.

779
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So I guess there are quite a few things coming to PlayStation Network. After all, who knew?

780
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, well, late at least. I don't know.

781
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Better eventually than not at all.

782
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay, as I promised, I'm going to show the video here, and I apologize.

783
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I can't make it full screen because YouTube's running really slow because we're trying to broadcast a show.

784
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I posted the link in chat, and if you guys at home want to see this video, search for a user on YouTube.

785
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
His name is Tinsley Advertising. T-I-N-S-L-E-Y Advertising. All one word there.

786
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Why every guy should buy their girlfriend Wii Fit.

787
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So here's the girl. She's starting to play Wii Fit.

788
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And look at that.

789
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I mean, and she's kind of like, you can tell she's kind of one of those cute nerdy girls, too. She's wearing glasses.

790
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Got a little ponytail, right?

791
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And then she has this little booty on her.

792
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And she's playing Wii Fit. What do you think, Loki?

793
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah. Loki gave thumbs up. Sorry we don't have Justice TV tonight, so you can see how Loki gave the thumbs up there.

794
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Dark Sakura, offensive or funny?

795
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm apathetic towards it.

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It was her idea. I'm sure it was.

797
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh, I didn't know you were filming me.

798
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm going to the end of the video just because you have to see this guy when he looks at the camera.

799
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He's like, yeah.

800
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well, yeah, you put the link in the chat room, so.

801
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There you have it. Just look.

802
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
See, now we're going to get a whole bunch of the chat room going.

803
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You know, I'm not even going to look at the chat room.

804
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay, Act Deaf is questioning my sexuality because, you know, I'm the gay one on the show, but I like girls.

805
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But I have an appreciation for the female form. I can see the, you know, I can see why people like this video.

806
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
She's taking it as a compliment.

807
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Anyways, so when, you know, while Europe may be enjoying Puzzle Fighter on PlayStation Network, one game they will not be enjoying is Africa, or Africa.

808
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Apparently, Sony has taken it upon themselves to say, fuck you Europe, and they're not releasing the game out there.

809
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Although, I don't know if that's really a bad thing because the game doesn't look that good.

810
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Especially if I can't run over the wildlife.

811
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Are they releasing it in Africa?

812
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I would assume so, since that's, you know, not Europe. So, well, maybe.

813
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That would be really bad if Africa was excluded from their own game.

814
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I want to be able to run over the animals. That is the only way I will buy this game.

815
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
They just need to do a new Jambo Safari.

816
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But, hey, if you ever wanted to go to a virtual safari, then Africa is the game for you.

817
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's supposed to be coming out in August.

818
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Do we know what Africa is yet? Anything about it.

819
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Isn't that a Taking Pictures game?

820
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I think so.

821
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Pokemon Snap, but not with Pokemon?

822
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I don't know.

823
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't know. Let's look at the other games that have come out that have been very similar.

824
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Endless Ocean. No one bought that.

825
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Wild Earth African Safari. No one bought that.

826
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Pokemon Snap. Long time ago, people bought it because it's Pokemon.

827
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And it's fun!

828
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Gotta catch them all.

829
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But that Cardcaptor Sakura game, that sucked ass. And I should know because I have it.

830
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But it came with a spoon.

831
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I remember. I think you talked about that a long time ago.

832
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It came with a spoon and a fork, a pillowcase and a clock. And a plate.

833
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There was also a Sakura Taisen game that came out that had a bunch of weird, bizarre shit in it.

834
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The good thing is though, if you are in Europe and you really, really, really want to play Africa.

835
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Region free, right?

836
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Exactly. So just import the US one.

837
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Africa.

838
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
If you have an HDTV.

839
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
There you have it.

840
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Alright. Let's see.

841
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Moving on. Talking about Bioshock.

842
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Bioshock's making its way to the PlayStation 3 if you weren't listening to last week's show.

843
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Apparently it's actually coming out a little sooner than maybe some folks expected.

844
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's coming out in October is when the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock is coming out.

845
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And apparently it's going to have all the upgrades that the Xbox 360 version got and patches and things like that.

846
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Also, there are new features and content that will make this a must-have game for its new audience.

847
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
As well as for those who enjoyed it on other platforms.

848
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I don't know if that means additional levels or weapons or other types of things.

849
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
God, I hope it's not multiplayer finally or something, you know?

850
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Can you imagine if PlayStation 3 had the Deathmatch exclusive?

851
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
No. They won't do that.

852
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah, I don't think the game's mechanics were built for that.

853
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
If anything, if they were talking about new content in there, I bet you it's the download content that was already available on the Xbox and PC.

854
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And maybe like a bonus level or something, right?

855
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't even think they're going to do that. Maybe another difficulty or something like that.

856
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
What would make me want to re-buy it if I already had it on the other systems unless there was some really good extras?

857
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Because it's not like we're talking about a cheap game here.

858
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Maybe the game will be cheap. Maybe that'll be the kicker. I don't know.

859
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What they could do, they could do some of the other cheap stuff that some other first-person shooters have done.

860
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Like a survival mode where they just keep sending enemies at you and see how long you can survive.

861
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't know. More plasmids, I guess, they could add to it.

862
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WhatupG in chat is asking, when is Bioshock 2 due out? Do we know anything about Bioshock 2?

863
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
No. I think 09, holiday.

864
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Huh. Alright. Well, we'll see what happens.

865
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm still shaking my head over this next story.

866
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Why?

867
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Because people are so gullible.

868
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't know if anyone has seen the Fallout 3 screenshots that were out that shows basically Washington

869
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
turned into a big, you know, soot-covered smoking crater.

870
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But an intelligence contractor called SITE, S-I-T-E, Intel Group, thought that they were al-Qaeda images, you know, propaganda.

871
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And a few, I guess, anti-US sites posted them up, you know, and had chat logs and everything about it,

872
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
saying that this was their big dream to see or whatever.

873
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But it was, there were screens for Fallout 3.

874
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So there hasn't been, they haven't heard any word back officially.

875
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But one thing that I did think was funny in this article on Kotaku is that SITE is based in Bethesda.

876
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Well, I mean, it's actually terrorists are using those images from Fallout 3 or supposed terrorists.

877
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Well, I think they're just affiliated sites. I don't think they're actually, I think they're just like terrorist fanboys or something.

878
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Terrorist fanboys?

879
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, you know, any political faction is gonna have their little followers, so.

880
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And just to kind of go back a few, well, it's not even really a story, but that YouTube that you were talking about there,

881
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
apparently there was some comments on the dig for it, and Tinsley Advertising actually replied back,

882
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
says, sorry guys, I got on Dig Front Page and, well, my girlfriend found out and she's a tiny bit upset.

883
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I thought it was cute and it actually, or it was done with good intentions if she ever doubted how hot she is.

884
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Over one million views on that YouTube, though.

885
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I mean, she's an internet star, at least her butt is.

886
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I mean, she's never seen her face. Can you imagine walking by her on the street?

887
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Where do I know you from? Where do I know you from?

888
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And then as she's leaving, I remember.

889
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Forget it. All right.

890
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's kind of, you know, if Dan did that, I'd have to smack him.

891
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,000
May Satsuma in chat says, I would buy Bioshock again if it came with the living Big Daddy, then just the statue. It's pretty awesome.

892
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
About the Fallout things, though, I saw that picture of the whole like Washington, D.C. looking destroyed thing.

893
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And it is pretty scary how realistic some of these games are getting.

894
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But then again, I mean, remember Independence Day?

895
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah. Remember when the trailers for that movie came out?

896
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
This is a long ass time ago, right? Who doesn't remember the movie Independence Day?

897
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I guess if you were really young, you might not, because that movie came out when I was in junior high.

898
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No way. I saw that when I was in college.

899
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Really?

900
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes.

901
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Is it that? I thought it was like early 90s.

902
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
No, no, no, no. I was in college because I remember going to see that with my friends who lived on campus.

903
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
OK, so maybe I was like a junior or senior in high school.

904
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Because they paid for me. Because that was the only way I'd see it.

905
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I remember that movie where they installed Mac OS on the alien mothership and destroyed all the aliens.

906
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

907
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It was like 90.

908
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Apple blew up the aliens.

909
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah, it was right before I moved out here.

910
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Here's the thing. I don't want to argue about the year.

911
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
What I want to talk about is, remember in the trailer for the movie, one of the things they would show is that big alien ship blowing up the White House?

912
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The first time I saw that trailer, everybody in the audience cheered.

913
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Which I thought was funny.

914
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
OK, the chatroom agrees it was 1995.

915
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So, I mean, it's not like we haven't seen these horrific images, quote unquote, before.

916
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But, you know, at least when you're watching a movie trailer, you know you're watching a movie trailer.

917
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But when you see these random images on the internet of Washington D.C. looking all destroyed, it's kind of scary if you don't know what it is.

918
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
You know what I mean?

919
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I guess.

920
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Well, this game may not be as cool as Fallout 3, but definitely one that I'm looking forward to.

921
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Splatterhouse, the brand new remake.

922
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
They've got some interesting features that they've been talking about.

923
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
One of which is the fact that your limbs can basically be taken off.

924
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But after a short bit, they will actually regrow back.

925
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So that's kind of cool.

926
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And very detailed.

927
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I guess instead of like a health system, your skin will start coming off, then your flesh and then your bones will break.

928
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And all that stuff will kind of just grow right back.

929
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Sounds lovely.

930
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes. And then apparently the Killzone scriptwriter, Gordon Rennie, and I guess he did Judge Dredd and the Necronauts comics.

931
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
He's signed on to do the story for this game as well.

932
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
So that's pretty cool.

933
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And the graphics on it so far look pretty good and very bloody.

934
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Much like the original.

935
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yay, violence!

936
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I like violence.

937
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Violence is fantastic.

938
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And sell stuff.

939
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I hope the new Splatterhouse is kind of awesome because the old one kind of got boring fast.

940
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I mean it was cool in theory, but it kind of got boring fast.

941
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So, we'll see.

942
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Geekboy2424 is being a little bit creepy in chat.

943
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
He's said this several times now.

944
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
He says he has an idea for the anniversary show.

945
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The Dark Sakura should get in panties and do the hula hoop game.

946
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
No.

947
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Here, I'll tell you what. We'll make a compromise.

948
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I will get in panties and play the hula hoop game. How's that sound?

949
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
No.

950
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Just kidding. I'm not actually going to do that.

951
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Little creepy. Little creepy.

952
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Alright.

953
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Moving on.

954
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Talking about Metal Gear Solid 4.

955
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
We kind of referenced this earlier because Konami is telling some people to put a lid on it.

956
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Minor, minor spoilers here from Metal Gear Solid 4.

957
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So, if you don't want to know, skip ahead in the podcast by about a minute, but these are just minor spoilers.

958
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Don't worry.

959
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Here's the thing.

960
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Rosemary from Metal Gear Solid 2 is supposed to make an appearance, as well as Mei Ling from Metal Gear Solid the original.

961
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
They are going to be some characters in Metal Gear Solid 4.

962
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So, if you are looking forward to being reunited with some of your favorite females from Metal Gear history, there you go.

963
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And maybe you can convince Mei Ling to get in her panties and play Wii Fit. I don't know.

964
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
No.

965
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You'll have to write a letter to Konami.

966
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You used to be able to piss her off in the first game anyway.

967
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Anyway, speaking of Metal Gear Solid 4, the soundtrack actually has been released in Japan.

968
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake Gets Old. I'm sorry, Guns of the Patriots.

969
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It's by Nobuko Toda and Harry Gregson Williams, who did the stuff before.

970
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You can actually get it from Playasia for $28, but there are spoilers on the track listing.

971
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So, if you don't want spoilers, then don't get it.

972
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
However, if you do get the limited edition of the game, you will get a copy of the soundtrack too.

973
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So, who?

974
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,000
By the way, for Bomani fans, fans of Konami's music game series, I did notice one familiar name showed up on the soundtrack.

975
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Sota Fujimori, apparently contributed to a couple tracks too.

976
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And he did some of the remixes in BeatMania 2DX.

977
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So, a little Konami connection there. There you have it.

978
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Konami connection.

979
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I know.

980
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Just one big happy family.

981
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
They kind of do that though with a lot of their soundtracks, especially Contra and stuff has a lot of the Konami artists on there.

982
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You always see Akira and Sota.

983
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Anyways, one thing you will find this week is it's starting to get a little bit more packed with game releases again.

984
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So, that's kind of good.

985
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This week, we've got a bunch of stuff coming out.

986
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
First off, we've got Robert Lindgren's The Bourne Conspiracy.

987
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

988
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Also, this week, we've got the Incredible Hulk game, which is coming out on practically everything.

989
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
HULK SMASH!

990
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's the only reason I'd buy this game.

991
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It's supposed to not suck that bad, but we'll have to see.

992
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And then there's, of course, Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Xbox 360, which looks pretty awesome.

993
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And also coming out on practically everything, Lego Indiana Jones.

994
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So that looks pretty cool.

995
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And Kung Fu Panda, yet another movie tie-in.

996
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
The trailer for that looks kind of funny, actually.

997
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I don't know. I do and I don't want a game called Kung Fu Panda.

998
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Because on one hand, it sounds really awesome, and on one hand, it sounds like a lot could go wrong.

999
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yeah.

1000
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's based on a movie, right?

1001
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yes.

1002
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That's what I thought.

1003
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Then on the Wii, there's Cabela's Trophy Bucks, which looks like crap.

1004
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
On the PSP, Hot Shots Golf Open T2.

1005
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
On the DS, Summon Knight Twin Age, which looks like a pretty cool Atlus RPG.

1006
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Let's see here. We've also got the, supposedly, the God of War PSP bundle is going to be coming out this week as well.

1007
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And Grid on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1008
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Aw, too bad it's not THE Grid.

1009
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Remember that game at Golf Land?

1010
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Uh...

1011
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Forget it.

1012
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Okay, well this game looks aw- this game's probably a lot better than THE Grid, so...

1013
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But I am surprised we haven't seen that come to, like, home consoles.

1014
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Me too. Maybe they should make that for Xbox Live or something.

1015
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And, uh, let's see here. And then finally, um, next Sunday, the Metallic Rose DS Lite will be coming out.

1016
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
More colors, yay!

1017
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's metallic pink-ish, you know.

1018
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's light-ish red!

1019
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yay!

1020
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Replacing the, um, normal pink, so...

1021
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
So now everyone's gonna go scramble over themselves to get that?

1022
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Apparently, yes.

1023
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Can't wait.

1024
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Special.

1025
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Alright, let's talk about what's coming out in Japan overseas.

1026
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Coming out on June 5th for the Xbox 360, FIFA Street 3, as well as Ninja Gaiden 2, finally makes its way out in Japan on the Xbox 360.

1027
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Going over to the PlayStation 3, Dragon Ball Z Burst Limit makes its way, as well as another port of FIFA Street 3.

1028
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And if we head on over to the Nintendo Wii, Fushugi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 3, Karakuri Yashiki no Nimuri Hime.

1029
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I have no idea what that game is, but it's being made by Sega.

1030
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And, let's see, it is an RPG, that's about all I know, I'm trying to see if we have any screenshots of this game.

1031
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And sadly we do not, we just have box art.

1032
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Where the guy, dude, the guy looks like he has a little ferret as a companion.

1033
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Ferrets are great!

1034
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
This might be a winner already, look at the box art, you can see it.

1035
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I can't see!

1036
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's Shiren the Wanderer.

1037
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's a series that's ran since Saturn, I wanna say.

1038
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And they just had one that came out on the DS in the US.

1039
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Well, it's Shiren the Wanderer 3 then.

1040
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But dude, he's got like a little ferret companion on his shoulder.

1041
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's a dungeon crawler.

1042
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So did Beastmaster, he had two ferrets.

1043
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And of course we endorse any game with ferrets in it, so.

1044
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That we do.

1045
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Absolutely.

1046
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Rob Ferret!

1047
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I, um, I'm trying.

1048
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's right in front of you.

1049
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I don't know where the ferret is.

1050
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Hide it.

1051
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Give.

1052
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Woohoo!

1053
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Alright, um, let's see, moving on to other Japanese releases, that was it for the Nintendo Wii.

1054
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
On the Playstation 2, Ukuki is coming out.

1055
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
What?

1056
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Ukuki.

1057
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Okay.

1058
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That's what I say all the time.

1059
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Ukuki.

1060
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I don't think it's that.

1061
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
This is an adventure game from, who's making this, Global A Entertainment.

1062
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And no screenshots or nothing, I couldn't tell you exactly what this game is.

1063
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
But the box art is very artistic.

1064
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Looks kinda hand drawn almost.

1065
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Uh, Ukuki.

1066
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Uh, Yamasad, Digi World, Collaboration SP, Pochi Slot Ridge Racer.

1067
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Ugh.

1068
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
You can just imagine what that is.

1069
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I'll just leave it at that.

1070
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
No.

1071
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm sure it is that.

1072
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
No.

1073
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Pachinko for Ridge Racer.

1074
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I know.

1075
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's a Pachinko slot machine.

1076
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
On the Nintendo DS, Deep Aquarium.

1077
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
What is Deep Aquarium?

1078
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It's exactly what it sounds like.

1079
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's an aquarium.

1080
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I'll be damned.

1081
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It really is.

1082
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It is.

1083
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
No, it looks like the bottom of these.

1084
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It looks like Titanic imagery there from the cover.

1085
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Deep Titanic Aquarium.

1086
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It's definitely.

1087
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yes, you too can take care of your frozen corpses.

1088
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
At first I thought it was in San Aquarium, but I was sadly mistaken.

1089
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And nothing this week on the Sony PSP.

1090
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Sorry PSP fans in Japan.

1091
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
That's it for release dates overseas in Japan.

1092
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Well, back to a different side of overseas.

1093
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
We have our UK release dates and there's not a whole bunch of stuff.

1094
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But hey, it's stuff still.

1095
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
One that Rob would probably be interested in.

1096
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I just have to say really quick.

1097
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Hitstun has played that series of games and it is a ferret.

1098
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
In the game.

1099
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Do want.

1100
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay.

1101
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Thank you chatters.

1102
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
On DS comes Etrian Odyssey.

1103
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Everybody's Golf 2 for PSP.

1104
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Lego Indiana Jones for a whole crap ton of everything else.

1105
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Mass Effect on PC.

1106
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Ninja Gaiden 2, Xbox 360, and for Rob, Civilization Revolution.

1107
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Hooray!

1108
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Except I heard it got pushed back here in America.

1109
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So I'm wondering at like the very last minute.

1110
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So I'm wondering if the same thing didn't happen.

1111
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It only got pushed back a week.

1112
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Or over in Europe.

1113
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's the second week in July.

1114
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
No, that's more than a week.

1115
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It was supposed to be out the first week in June.

1116
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Supposed to be the first week in...

1117
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh yeah, average.

1118
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It'll be out the first week of June in...

1119
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I knew about that a long time ago.

1120
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It just got delayed like a couple days ago.

1121
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
No it didn't.

1122
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It's been that date for a long time.

1123
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Well that's when I heard about it.

1124
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Well people just didn't know about it.

1125
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well...

1126
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
But there's also a bunch of good stuff though coming out this month.

1127
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
If Europe gets that too, I'm gonna cry.

1128
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Because I love Civilization.

1129
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm actually probably gonna get this game.

1130
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Because it seems like it really simplified what was becoming a very...

1131
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Oh god, I sound so like dumb and baby.

1132
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Question though.

1133
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Are you gonna get it for the 360 or DS?

1134
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
360.

1135
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Achievements.

1136
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Why?

1137
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Achievements.

1138
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Yeah.

1139
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
That's what I said.

1140
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Why not?

1141
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm assuming there's something for Xbox Live.

1142
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Remember CivNet?

1143
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That game was the sh...

1144
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I love CivNet.

1145
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
If I could find a copy of CivNet that still worked, I'd actually probably play it.

1146
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It's awesome.

1147
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Cool.

1148
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
There you go.

1149
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Akuma, JP, and Chat by the way just linked the official website for that game.

1150
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Because he actually lives in Japan so he knows a little bit about some of the releases going

1151
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
on over there.

1152
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Is he gonna get the gardening game?

1153
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
No, nothing...

1154
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh, is he gonna get the gardening game?

1155
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I somehow doubt it.

1156
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You know, if you really want the gardening game, you can just do a Japanese account and

1157
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
buy them.

1158
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
No.

1159
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
No.

1160
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Alright.

1161
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Back to news.

1162
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Anyways, if gardening's not your thing, then perhaps Red vs. Blue is your thing.

1163
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Red vs. Blue just released their brand new series, Reconstruction.

1164
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Now, it's a little bit more serious and less funny than the original.

1165
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Actually, it's not even really that funny at all, but definitely more serious now.

1166
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
People aren't sure if maybe this first episode is serious as kind of like a joke that's gonna

1167
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
run through the whole thing, or if this whole thing's very serious.

1168
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't know.

1169
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But either way, you can definitely check it out on RoosterTeeth.com.

1170
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And I'm pretty sure that stuff's also on Xbox Live, their video marketplace.

1171
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
But RoosterTeeth.com for Red vs. Blue, Reconstruction.

1172
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Which, of course, is set in Halo 3.

1173
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Very nice.

1174
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Well, one of these days, there ought to be a Halo movie.

1175
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I know that's been all going back and forth, and video game movies seem to be all the rage

1176
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
right now.

1177
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And now throwing their hat into the ring, Brett Ratner.

1178
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
He's a pretty famous Hollywood director.

1179
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
He did the Rush Hour trilogy.

1180
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
He did the third part in the X-Men series, so take that however you want.

1181
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So do we stab him with our plastic knives yet?

1182
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Depending on if you liked or disliked that film.

1183
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
He was also on that short-lived reality show about Hollywood that was on Fox last year.

1184
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
On the Lot.

1185
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
That's what it was called.

1186
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
He was one of the judges on On the Lot.

1187
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
That's the first time I've ever heard of that.

1188
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's fucking sad that I know that.

1189
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
That show was poorly rated, too.

1190
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I remember watching the first episode and saying, this is lame.

1191
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I watched the first episode, too, and went, this is lame.

1192
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Anyhow, here's the thing is that apparently he is saying that he's going to be getting

1193
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
into gaming.

1194
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He says he'll, quote, be doing movies that come from video games.

1195
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
He also is mentioning that he has ties to the Activision catalogs.

1196
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So possibly Call of Duty.

1197
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
That'd be lame.

1198
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Soldier of Fortune.

1199
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Who knows?

1200
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I can't see it.

1201
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Guitar Hero, the movie.

1202
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I can see them doing something original, but Call of Duty.

1203
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I mean, there's no characters in it.

1204
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It's just a war game.

1205
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't know.

1206
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It would be hard for them to do that.

1207
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It'd be just like doing a war movie.

1208
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Assassin's Creed, perhaps?

1209
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Perhaps.

1210
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It might be a little while before this movie comes out, but something to consider.

1211
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Some other news that was around the internet this week.

1212
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Tigerclaw in our chat is sharing, Brett Ratner is also going to direct Beverly Hills Cop

1213
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
4 with Eddie Murphy.

1214
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It was apparently announced this week.

1215
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I also heard a rumor that he may be doing the God of War movie.

1216
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I also heard a rumor that he sucks.

1217
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Rumor?

1218
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Well, that may be a fact.

1219
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Geekboy2424 says, like the Zelda movie, please make it happen.

1220
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Please, please, please.

1221
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
In true fanboy fashion.

1222
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Wasn't that IGN thing good enough?

1223
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I think that that was all that there needs to be.

1224
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yes, the IGN thing is all you're ever going to get, probably.

1225
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
When has Nintendo ever...

1226
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Oh, wait.

1227
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I take that back before it comes...

1228
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Because I remember I was going to say, when has Nintendo ever let any of their properties

1229
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
become movies?

1230
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And that's because for quite a while, I had the Super Mario Brothers movie erased from

1231
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
my memory.

1232
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I was just thinking that, actually.

1233
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And I just brought it back for all the rest of you.

1234
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Remember Dennis Hopper's Bowser?

1235
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
No, I didn't actually see that movie.

1236
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Good times.

1237
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
John Leguizamo, Luigi.

1238
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I actually have not seen that movie.

1239
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh, we need to have a movie night.

1240
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
No.

1241
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1242
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Speaking of movies, before we get into the next story, Loki, you didn't talk about it

1243
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
during your gaming week, but you have to take a sneak peek at a recent movie, right?

1244
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yes.

1245
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I was screen number 14 for Postal.

1246
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Actually, I've been watching that.

1247
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,000
We got legitimate screener copies at our place of employment and got to check it out.

1248
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's actually watchable, I guess.

1249
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
They're trying to be controversial.

1250
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I don't know if I'm just desensitized to a lot of this stuff or if it just really falls

1251
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
flat, but there's some funny parts.

1252
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
There's a part that I laughed at where he's at a job interview and they're asking him

1253
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
all these really stupid questions and then the very final question they ask him is this

1254
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:58,000
woman and she's like, what is the difference between a duck?

1255
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It makes no sense.

1256
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
He just blows up at her and his day kind of gets worse from there.

1257
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I don't know.

1258
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
There's funny parts, I guess, in it.

1259
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
There's a part where Uwe Abel gets his nuts blown off and he falls down dead saying I

1260
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
hate video games.

1261
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Nice.

1262
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Any time that he was on screen, he wasn't even funny.

1263
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
He was trying to be funny where, oh, I finance my movies with Nazi gold.

1264
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I like children.

1265
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It just wasn't very funny.

1266
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Other parts, there's a part where they use a cat as a silencer and that was kind of funny

1267
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
because it's just ridiculous.

1268
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
There's a lot of ridiculous stuff in it.

1269
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Well, Postal's a pretty ridiculous game, too.

1270
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
There's a gunfight where it seems like the only people getting killed brutally is children.

1271
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That's kind of sick.

1272
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And then there's a part in the beginning where they're arguing about how many virgins they're

1273
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
going to get when they blow up a plane and stuff because 9-11, how funny.

1274
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I don't know.

1275
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The thing is, like some other movies I've seen that have tried to be controversial,

1276
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
it doesn't really work.

1277
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I mean, it sort of is, I guess, but it's not like, oh my god, this is horrible, blah blah

1278
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
blah.

1279
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's just kind of, it's such a ridiculous setting, you just kind of get desensitized

1280
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
to the whole thing.

1281
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But I will say, having seen other Uwe Abel movies, it's watchable.

1282
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's a bad movie, but you can watch it and be entertained by it, I guess.

1283
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Is it one of those movies that I'm going to be seeing at Midnight Mass several years from

1284
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
now, or the trash film orgy here in SAC?

1285
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I don't know if I'd give it that much credit.

1286
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I would say that it's like Cheerleader Ninjas, but not quite as funny.

1287
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So probably not Midnight Mass.

1288
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Let me put it this way.

1289
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Midnight Mass is a thing they do in San Francisco.

1290
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
It's a midnight thing they do every summer, and it's hosted by a drag queen named Peaches

1291
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Christ.

1292
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Let me put it this way, it's worth like a dollar rental or something like that.

1293
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I mean, I would maybe check it out just to say you've seen it.

1294
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Don't expect it to be very controversial or anything like that.

1295
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I mean, there's parts that they just get ridiculous with, like Full Frontal Dave Foley and stuff

1296
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
like that.

1297
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,000
But it's just, I don't know, it kind of works, but at the same time it's just really ridiculous

1298
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and very low budget, I guess.

1299
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
DJ Jenai in chat says Postal equals the Razzie movie of the year.

1300
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Do you think the Razzies will even remember this movie?

1301
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I don't even think it deserves a Razzie.

1302
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I mean, as it is, it's 13 screens right now.

1303
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
13 screens that it's on.

1304
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
13!

1305
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Hey, that's a lot better than the 4 that was originally thought that it was supposed to

1306
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
be on.

1307
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know.

1308
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I kind of want to see it just so I can understand for myself how...

1309
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's not coming out for a while, I mean, on DVD.

1310
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Not that far away, but not for a few months.

1311
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I think I'd like to view.

1312
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
All right, let's keep moving with the news.

1313
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Some of our listeners want to break so they can go to the bathroom.

1314
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah, some people do want that, don't they?

1315
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Yes.

1316
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,000
At any rate, another series that has a pretty good following is the Brothers in Arms series.

1317
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:34,000
There is actually a book that was put out, a novelization that covers two of the days

1318
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
that weren't covered in the ten days of the operation that the game covers.

1319
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Basically, the game is selfless for when the Allies were trying to seize a bridge in the

1320
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Netherlands in 1944.

1321
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But now, there's also talks about there being a movie based off of the Hell's Highway thing,

1322
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
so that might be pretty cool.

1323
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
See, that could work, because Brothers in Arms actually has characters and a story that

1324
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
it follows instead of just war, war, war, war, shoot, shoot, kill, kill.

1325
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Nazi dead.

1326
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Exactly.

1327
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They have material to work with.

1328
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
They've got a good source.

1329
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It's one of the biggest things that bugs me about...

1330
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yeah, but Saving Private Ryan, it's not.

1331
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:26,000
One of the things that bugs me about movies made from video games is where they take material

1332
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
here and they try to translate it into something that would be believable.

1333
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
However, if they're going to get the fans of the game to see it, then they need to stay.

1334
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Like, Silent Hill stayed true to its roots, I thought.

1335
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And I thought, you know, how many fans of the series liked the movie?

1336
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I mean, just about everyone I talked to.

1337
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But Silent Hill did take a lot of shit as well.

1338
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I don't remember the girl whining in the Silent Hill game.

1339
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Silent Hill! Silent Hill!

1340
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I would have thrown her off the cliff myself.

1341
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I think she just said it twice.

1342
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But, no, that was a lot.

1343
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Well, it was when she had her dream.

1344
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'd like to point out Silent Hill did have Pyramid Head ripping somebody's skin off,

1345
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
so it did deliver her.

1346
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That was the greatest...

1347
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That was the fan service.

1348
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Exactly.

1349
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Like, he made the shouty bitch shut up.

1350
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And the very end of it, too, when they killed the boar queen.

1351
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They need Silent Hill 2. Pyramid Head rapes everyone.

1352
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
No.

1353
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Ooh, now I need dream movies.

1354
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Oh, my God. No.

1355
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yes, Pyramid Head gets set loose on the streets of San Diego.

1356
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But I'm saying that there's been other adaptations of, you know...

1357
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And really, I don't think it necessarily has to do with just video game adaptations,

1358
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
but, like, you know, we've had comic adaptations

1359
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and we've had different types of ones where they just completely shred the, you know, original material

1360
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and try to say, oh, but we should have been this.

1361
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And I was like, no, no, no, no.

1362
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I've got it, Rob.

1363
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Silent Hill 6, The Roommate.

1364
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You can actually have where...

1365
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It could be like a comedy, like a sitcom, you know,

1366
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
where some guy ends up getting this roommate because he needs an apartment

1367
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and can't find any other places to rent.

1368
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And that roommate happens to be Pyramid Head.

1369
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And, oh, hilarity ensues.

1370
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
That sounds like it would be a cheesy YouTube series.

1371
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Pyramid Head. Oh, man, you're leaving skins of corpses around.

1372
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
What the hell?

1373
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
God, what was it? Someone linked me to a YouTube series

1374
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
that had, like, a bunch of different horror movie slashers playing poker together.

1375
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Nice.

1376
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And Jason had to go home because his mother wanted him to go home.

1377
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
You know, they have to dress him up for, you know, the guy's parents coming over

1378
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
or something like that so they don't get all creeped out.

1379
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's like wearing a bonnet or something.

1380
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Take WD-40 to that rusty head.

1381
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1382
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Anyway, but no.

1383
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Paint a face on him like Jack.

1384
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Okay, you realize I'm going to go home and draw this now, right?

1385
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Oh, dear.

1386
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
But anyway, but no, but do you get my point?

1387
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yes.

1388
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Is that if they're taking something that there are already an established fan base for,

1389
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I understand wanting to get more people than just the fan base to see it,

1390
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
but they need to stay true to their core material.

1391
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
That's why I'm actually kind of, I'm feeling actually kind of good about, you know,

1392
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
doing a movie for this series because you've got something established

1393
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
and easy to work with, I think.

1394
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Something that there's not really too much room to fuck it up unless you let,

1395
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
you know, Uwe Boll do it.

1396
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Well, we'll see what happens.

1397
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, I don't really know how to translate or I should say kind of move over to this story,

1398
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
but hey, let's talk about something completely different, I guess.

1399
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
How about something local?

1400
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yeah, something local.

1401
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Local news.

1402
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
What?

1403
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Yes, apparently someone is acknowledging Stockton, California.

1404
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Why?

1405
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I don't know because apparently they wrote an article about, you know,

1406
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 and how it's making people crazy,

1407
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
but apparently according to the Stockton record, they have a couple quotes here.

1408
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
My son Peter was never really aggressive, but once he got into the video games,

1409
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
GTA being one of them, he started to push, hit, talk back,

1410
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
and just become a different person.

1411
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It said Stockton parent Greg Within.

1412
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
His last name is Within.

1413
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That's kind of weird.

1414
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And it doesn't really say how old his son is.

1415
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I know people that are letting their like eight-year-old son play these games,

1416
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
so like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty 4.

1417
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I don't get it.

1418
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And then anyways, there's another one.

1419
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
It's all this other guy who's 19 said he was involved in an altercation a week

1420
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
after he purchased Grand Theft Auto 4.

1421
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:30,000
He says at the time he noticed that he had become less sensitive to violence.

1422
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Grand Theft Auto 4, tearing a neighborhood apart.

1423
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And the 19-year-old says it didn't completely blame the game for his violence,

1424
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
but it did affect him.

1425
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I don't know.

1426
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It sounds retarded.

1427
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It was covered on Game Politics,

1428
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and you can also find it at recordnet.com,

1429
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
which is the official Stockton newspaper's website.

1430
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And yes, Stockton is like the butthole of the Sacramento area.

1431
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It's not even Sacramento area.

1432
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's more like that space between Sacramento and L.A.

1433
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
that you drive down on the freeway.

1434
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Or worse yet, that space between Sacramento and Fresno.

1435
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And you can blame Jesse.

1436
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
They do have a good arcade there, though.

1437
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Corona as the author of the original.

1438
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's Grand Theft Auto 4, criticized by Stockonians.

1439
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Stockonians!

1440
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Wow!

1441
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Is that what they call themselves?

1442
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
That's retarded.

1443
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Apologies to all of our listeners in Stockton, California.

1444
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
The fact that you live there.

1445
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Do they have a good golf land?

1446
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
They have a Para Para machine.

1447
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
The golf land was kind of cool.

1448
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Do they still have the Para Para?

1449
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I don't know.

1450
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It's been a long time since we've been to Stockton Golf Land.

1451
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
We should go to Stockton Golf Land.

1452
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Why?

1453
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
You are actually suggesting we go to Stockton willingly.

1454
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
To Golf Land.

1455
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
We'll see.

1456
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Do they have an S Mart?

1457
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Only if we get to...

1458
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Yes, they do have an S Mart.

1459
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I have to comment on it every time we go by there.

1460
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And you know something else?

1461
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Is that they actually spell it out, Save Mart, now.

1462
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Oh, shoot.

1463
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
That sucks.

1464
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And you know something that's pretty funny, though, too?

1465
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Is this story right here is basically written about the launch day of Grand Theft Auto 4.

1466
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yet it's coming out a month afterwards.

1467
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I mean, talk about trying to fill space.

1468
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Sorry.

1469
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Let's see.

1470
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

1471
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I heard a mother say she got the game for her kid because he was being made fun of in school for not having the game.

1472
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Meanwhile, the kid was 12.

1473
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Stupid.

1474
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Wowzers.

1475
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Kids will get made fun of for anything.

1476
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,000
The color of their hair, their name, the clothes they wear, the way they walk, talk, behave.

1477
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Just get over it.

1478
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
That's school for you.

1479
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Well, guess what?

1480
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I have some more Grand Theft Auto 4 related news.

1481
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Benny Hill's coming to a no, it's actually has to do with the kind of an idiot.

1482
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And it has to do with a 13 year old boy.

1483
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And we can't give out his name because he's only 13.

1484
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But if we could, he would win this week's stupid award.

1485
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
This is coming from the police.

1486
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Paul Chastani. He's a lieutenant of a Massachusetts police force.

1487
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
It was a male 13 year old.

1488
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And what he did, he stayed after class when other students had left the classroom and then pulled an 11 inch knife on the teacher and asked for 20 bucks.

1489
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
When the teacher refused, he lowered his demand to one dollar.

1490
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Give me a dollar.

1491
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
The teacher then took the knife from the student.

1492
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
It doesn't explain how that happened, but the teacher was able to get the knife away from the student.

1493
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And just like punched him.

1494
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But no, no, here's the thing.

1495
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:47,000
The police said the boy wanted to buy the video game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but his mother had refused to give him the money.

1496
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So he came up with an alternate plan.

1497
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
So first off, why was the kid trying to get Grand Theft Auto San Andreas?

1498
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Dude, that game's been out for like years.

1499
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Maybe he only has a PlayStation 2.

1500
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Because apparently his mom's a bitch for not buying him any violent video games.

1501
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I guess that makes sense, because I think it's cheaper now, so only 20 bucks might cover that game.

1502
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Actually, it wouldn't.

1503
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
He'd be slightly short with tax, so sucks for him.

1504
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
But the moral of the story is, this guy sucks.

1505
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And his parents kind of suck for letting him get away with this.

1506
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So there you have it.

1507
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And then of course, whenever we hear these types of stories and get out stupid words, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

1508
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And when I get angsty, people die. Oh, and the FUs of the week happen.

1509
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I mean seriously, San Andreas?

1510
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You know, I don't really think I'm angsty about anything right now.

1511
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Make something up.

1512
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
FU to my digestive system.

1513
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Okay.

1514
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
For killing me softly with imp song.

1515
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Thank you, Roberta Flack.

1516
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Uh, Logie?

1517
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Uh, FU to Monster Mini Golf.

1518
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It's this chain of indoor mini golf places.

1519
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
They opened one up here in Rancho Cordova.

1520
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I wanna go there, does it suck?

1521
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It does suck. It's at the Nimbus Winery.

1522
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Yeah, that's where it's big eye pedigree is.

1523
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Um, so, here's my problem with it.

1524
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
First off, they just put no thought into the course design whatsoever.

1525
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It just, it kinda goes around there in a giant maze.

1526
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
There is, there are no barriers from one hole to the next, so you don't know where one course begins and another one ends.

1527
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And, you practically have to search the course to find the hole that you're supposed to be knocking the ball into.

1528
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So they spent little time on the course, but they have all these cool props that are like all pneumatic and stuff like that that are really cool.

1529
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But really, I mean, indoor mini golf in this area would be a fucking awesome idea.

1530
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It's just, why isn't anyone doing it right?

1531
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I mean, if I had the money to set up something like that, I would at least put a few seconds thought into the actual course instead of just throwing some shit together.

1532
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I will not be going back.

1533
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Uh, I give an FU to driving home at 2.30 in the morning and, uh, falling asleep at the wheel.

1534
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But thankfully, somebody else was there to take over. I didn't drive unsafe, but just FU to the fact that I thought I'd be able to stay up and I couldn't.

1535
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I couldn't do it.

1536
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
FU to me being weak.

1537
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Alright.

1538
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
One thing that we will not be giving an FU to because it's awesome is, uh, classic video games that we love and adore.

1539
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And, uh, we're about ready to wrap up part A, but we can't do it until we pay some respect to our elders.

1540
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And, uh, we do that by asking the one and only DarkSakura to dig through the archives of games every week and pick out one of her favorites to be featured as, the OLR Classic Game of the Week.

1541
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
DarkSakura, what should the kids be checking out this week?

1542
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
It's a little game called Ghouls and Ghosts.

1543
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Um, also called Daya Makaimura, which, um, is really, really, you know, it's Ghouls and Ghosts, how can you go wrong with that?

1544
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It's classic. Hence, Classic Game of the Week.

1545
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Anyway.

1546
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's like, isn't it? Okay, the music is the best.

1547
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
See?

1548
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Okay, anyway, you play as a knight called, uh, Arthur who has to go through a bunch of really friggin' tough stages to go rescue, um, his, uh, his woman and, uh, save, uh, souls sold by, uh, Lucifer.

1549
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And, um, I think it's funny that his bride is named Princess Prin Prin. That's really hilarious.

1550
01:18:46,000 --> 01:19:04,000
But anyway, um, you pick up different, um, weapons on the way, and actually this is a sequel to Makaimura, which was Ghouls and Goblins over here, um, and the change between, um, from this one to the last one is that you can fire up and, you know, jump and fire, um, um, but you also get different weapons.

1551
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Never use the sword. It sucks.

1552
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You want to get the lances.

1553
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
The holy water is okay.

1554
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But, um, you've also got different enemies that show up, like, you know, a bunch of demon-y things, and a magician that every so often will either turn him into an old man or a duck.

1555
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Yeah.

1556
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Um, you also get, um, you know, your gold armor, so you get, uh, your charge attack and one extra, I guess, hit that you can take.

1557
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
The really hard part about this game is that you do have a limited number of hits you can take.

1558
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Um, starting, you know, you start off with your basic armor, but if you get the gold armor, you take one hit, you go back to your basic armor.

1559
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
You get one hit, you go to a man running around in his underwear.

1560
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And then one more hit, you are dust.

1561
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Um, it has come out on, um, Amiga.

1562
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You literally just collapse into skulls and bones, which is kind of funny.

1563
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Yeah.

1564
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Um, Amiga, um, Arms Shreds, uh, CPC Atari ST, Commodore 64, raw.

1565
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Nice.

1566
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Sega Saturn, which I have that copy, and I actually bought it at a Babbage's.

1567
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So, I bought it at American Retailer, I think it's hilarious, because it was only on, uh, the Capcom Generations that they brought out in Japan.

1568
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Um, it came out on Playstation Super Graphics, Master System, Genesis, Virtual Console release, and ZX Spectrum.

1569
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
But, um, it's really freaking fun, and also this game, and I'm going to spoil it for everyone.

1570
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's only been out, you know, 20 years.

1571
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Oh my god, it's been out 20 years, it was released in 1988.

1572
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Okay, as of December, it will be out 20 years.

1573
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Okay.

1574
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Um, it was released in December 1988.

1575
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Um, but, um, I had a point.

1576
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Okay, um, so to spoil the ending, um, when you get to the end of the game, you have to do it again.

1577
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It's like, oh, guess what, remember all that sweating that you did to get through this game?

1578
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Ha ha ha ha, we lied, no ending, do it again.

1579
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And so, um, you have to go through the whole thing all over.

1580
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Um, it also had-

1581
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Sadistic.

1582
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I know, really evil.

1583
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Um, it also did have, um, a sequel to it, which in my opinion was disappointing, with Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

1584
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It did have a very epic opening, and it was really freaking hard, but I don't think that it was as much fun as this one.

1585
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And then the one that drove me crazy at E3 two years ago, hunting down, and then they kicked me off of playing it, was Ultimate Ghosts of Goblins.

1586
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Um, which is a PSP release.

1587
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And it was actually really fun, and just as freaking hard as all the other of them.

1588
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So, that's your game. That is the game.

1589
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So if you can beat this game, you have a very big E-peen, if you can beat this game.

1590
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I've beaten the game.

1591
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Then your E-peen is very big, congratulations.

1592
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I've seen my husband beat it on one credit.

1593
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That's crazy.

1594
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I've seen him beat a number of games, I've seen him beat our type on one credit.

1595
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Thanks.

1596
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week folks, Ghouls and Ghosts, on like a million different systems, so check it out.

1597
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The system you would urge though, I'm sure, has got to be the SEGA one, right?

1598
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Well, Saturn has the arcade perfect version, however, if you're going to get it for any of the home systems, it says Virtual Console as well.

1599
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Get the Genesis version.

1600
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Honestly, for any of the...

1601
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I didn't mind the Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts, I mean, I know you're not a fan, but...

1602
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Honestly, and this is not a problem because I was always a Super Nintendo fan girl, and I actually do like Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

1603
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Don't get me wrong at all, I like the game, it's just, it was a bit of a letdown.

1604
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Not as good.

1605
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's like, you know, it's comparing vanilla ice cream to chocolate peanut butter ice cream.

1606
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
No, it's like taking like...

1607
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
They're both good, but one's got peanut butter.

1608
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
No, no, no, no, no, you know what it's like using the ice cream analogy, okay?

1609
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
It's like getting Ben & Jerry's, and then getting Thrifty.

1610
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I love Thrifty ice cream.

1611
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I know! I love Thrifty ice cream too, but is it as good as Ben & Jerry's?

1612
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That's debatable. How about Baskin-Robbins? Baskin-Robbins is kind of frumpy. I don't know.

1613
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Baskin-Robbins has egg nog.

1614
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Here it is, here it is. Cold Stone vs. Soft Serve at McDonald's.

1615
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I wouldn't say it's that bad.

1616
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Soft Serve at McDonald's tastes like whipped cream.

1617
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Here we go with the food again. Look, we gotta take a break.

1618
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I have ice cream at home, Rob.

1619
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
It's called Medieval Madness and I bought it because it's the same as a pinball machine.

1620
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I can't eat ice cream right now, but what I can have, I have had it pretty awesome.

1621
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
There's a self-serve non-fat yogurt place over by William's house that's pretty awesome.

1622
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Because you get to make the yogurt yourself, and then they have toppings galore that you put on there.

1623
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
There's a TCBY by my house.

1624
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Good times. Alright, look, we're gonna take a break.

1625
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Okay.

1626
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So stay tuned for more of Orange Lounge Radio. We didn't even touch Nintendo Wii News and we got a whole lot of it coming up in the next segment.

1627
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
A little bit of Xbox 360 news as well, even though it was a little slow in the house of Microsoft this week.

1628
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
We'll be talking a little bit about those systems right after a quick break. We'll see you then.

1629
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1630
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
