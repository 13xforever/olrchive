WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.220
Tonight, June 29, 2008, is the latest game in a popular series going 8-bit.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.240
Diablo 3 is finally announced and we talk on air to Tommy Tallarico from Video Games

00:25.240 --> 00:26.240
Live!

00:26.240 --> 00:35.520
Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.520 --> 00:36.520
Radio.

00:36.520 --> 00:41.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:41.000 --> 00:42.500
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.040
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.220
You might know me as Sky if you talk to us online in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:50.220 --> 00:55.620
But also joining us tonight, as always, the one, the only, the lovely, happiest bunny

00:55.620 --> 01:03.480
on the farm, one and only, truly spectacular, dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.480
He's just trying to butter me up for something.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
Can I have a dollar?

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
No.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
I don't have a dollar.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.480
You don't have a dollar.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.480
No, I'm just kidding.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.480
I don't know.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.800
You can have some of my diet cherry Pepsi.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.040
I'm in a festive mood tonight.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.040
I don't know why.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.040
You've been busy.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.040
A busy boy.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
I have been a very busy boy.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.240
I was out of town most of the weekend.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.200
I was marching in a big parade this morning.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.720
I know what would make you cry.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.720
What would make me cry?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.520
You'll find out during what I've played this week.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.520
Okay.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.000
Well, we'll get to that in just a sec.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.480
But I wouldn't be able to get to How Was Your Gaming Week if I wasn't able to introduce

01:34.480 --> 01:36.720
the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.720
Hi.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
How are you?

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
I'm fine.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.520
I'm trying to figure out something that I was talking about before we started the show.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.960
I can't remember the damn name of the game and it's bugging me.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.560
What was it that we were talking about before the show?

01:48.560 --> 01:49.560
We talked about a lot of things before the show.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.880
I was saying that song should be in a side scrolling game.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.400
I'm like the new Konami one.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.600
I don't know the name of the game though.

01:56.600 --> 02:01.320
Well, when you listen to us live on All Games Radio, which is where we tape our show live

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
Sunday nights.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.100
We say we're a podcast, but really we're a live radio program because we have everything

02:06.100 --> 02:09.040
going on with the chat room and the calls we'll get to later.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.400
We play a little bit of live music that can't go to the podcast feed because it is copyright

02:13.400 --> 02:14.560
and all that good stuff.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.600
But we played a track by Akira Yomoka.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.800
You know him from the dude that does all the music of Silent Hill.

02:19.800 --> 02:24.520
He also contributes to one of our favorite gaming series ever, Beatmania 2DX, and that

02:24.520 --> 02:27.120
particular track was from Beatmania Gold.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.760
Playback Hate You was the name of that song.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.280
And Loki was saying it's a pretty awesome song that should be in another game he was

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
thinking of.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
There you have it.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
All right.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.600
Well, speaking of games, so we got a lot of gaming news tonight.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.960
We got interview tonight.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.960
Tommy Tallarico's here.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.680
He's going to be joining us during part B, but first we got to start the show as we always

02:44.680 --> 02:47.640
do with a little bit of how is your gaming week?

02:47.640 --> 02:49.400
Dark Soccer, what'd you play this week?

02:49.400 --> 02:55.800
I downloaded the, um, when we were at, uh, Weebie Toys, AKA Toys R Us, um, I downloaded

02:55.800 --> 03:02.160
the Iron Man DS game demo and, um, it kind of sucked, but the controls were really cool.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.160
I mean, the controls are kind of complicated, but they were pretty cool.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
Okay.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.640
So what, like, what are the controls kind of, can you describe it?

03:08.640 --> 03:11.480
It's, well, you've got your, it actually moves up, left, down, right.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.680
You know, just like any, you know, regular game doesn't do like flight commands, but

03:15.680 --> 03:19.160
when you shoot and you touch the touch screen on your little radar pad and it controls the

03:19.160 --> 03:20.160
direction you shoot.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.760
So you could actually move your thumb all around and have them circle around and shoot

03:23.760 --> 03:25.480
like that and still move in different directions.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.120
So that part was cool and you pick up bombs and lock on, but it was fairly difficult from

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
the get go.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.800
And honestly, that type of game needs a bigger screen.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.280
So, uh, that didn't quite fly.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.280
Okay.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.280
Here's the game I was talking about.

03:39.280 --> 03:45.600
It's Otomedius, which is a shooter game with, uh, cleavage heavy characters.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.920
It's kind of a grottiest spinoff and it's in arcades in Japan right now.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.840
And it's supposed to be coming to the Xbox 360 on September 25th in Japan.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.280
All right, there you go.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.320
So in high def on the 360.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.000
Now comment from our chat room at chat.orangelandsradio.com.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.920
This is J100 Matt going back to Iron Man says, and I thought Jamie was anti Tony Stark.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.880
Only, only the, um, well, okay, I like the character.

04:09.880 --> 04:15.440
I hate what a big dick he's been in the whole, you know, regular Marvel continuity, but I

04:15.440 --> 04:18.960
like the character and the movie was pretty cool.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.240
So the game, not nearly as cool as the movie.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.240
No.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.240
All right.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.240
And I played imagine babies today.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.640
I actually just gave it a try because my internet kept messing up.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.360
So I was like, what's more torturous than not being able to go online?

04:30.360 --> 04:31.360
Oh yeah.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.360
Playing.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.360
Imagine babies.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
Hi.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
That's me.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.400
Glattov is appearing through the door.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.700
He's going back to Kansas.

04:39.700 --> 04:44.880
So he's waving goodbye forever, but, um, sorry, but it sucked.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.280
I didn't want to wave the rattle at the stupid baby.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.200
So um, wait, how does imagine babies works?

04:51.200 --> 04:53.660
I picture it like Nintendogs the way you describe it.

04:53.660 --> 05:00.280
Like instead of your friend and he's going to be your babysitting, um, instructor and

05:00.280 --> 05:04.560
this woman comes by and by the way, it's like this funny cause she comes by, Oh, I usually

05:04.560 --> 05:09.360
have granny babysit my babies, but you must be granny's granddaughter, but granny died.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.920
So I'm like, what is this a stupid game?

05:12.920 --> 05:18.160
It's for little children and I'm like, it's kind of cute, but I'm like, I don't want any

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
real children.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.720
Why do I want fake children?

05:20.720 --> 05:27.760
So because fake children, you can like do stuff too and CPS won't get called.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.920
Don't let you do crap to them in the game.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.200
You can't pick them up and throw them out the window.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
Exactly.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.600
You can't dangle them out the window.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.720
All Michael Jackson's style in real life because that's wrong.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.760
But in a video game you could do anything.

05:38.760 --> 05:46.360
Well, at any rate, it sucked ass, um, and we moved to a new, uh, Ragnarok server because,

05:46.360 --> 05:51.520
um, our old one, um, has sort of gone to shit.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.520
Well that sucks.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.800
I'm playing on void RO now.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
They're pretty cool.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.560
A lot cooler actually.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.720
Very cool people run it.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.760
So I, I'm done.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.760
All right.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.760
Oh.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.760
Oh.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
Oh.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
Oh.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
Okay.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.720
So, um, left my ass off watching Dan play GTA four.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.380
It was pretty fun.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.600
What was so funny that happened?

06:14.600 --> 06:21.380
It was just him talking crap about the guy's cousin in the game and about how all he wants

06:21.380 --> 06:25.700
is, uh, is a big American boobs or something.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.700
Nice.

06:26.700 --> 06:34.380
So that game's kind of, it's, it's, it bothers me sort of, you know, but it's like a train

06:34.380 --> 06:36.720
wreck and it's kind of funny cause you know the real world.

06:36.720 --> 06:43.680
like that. Right. So, it's hilarious. Fear the Claw in chat.orangelandtrader.com

06:43.680 --> 06:47.520
says, if Imagine Babies is like Nintendogs, does that mean you can pet

06:47.520 --> 06:51.640
them to make them happy? That would be creepy. You can wave a rattle at them.

06:51.640 --> 06:56.680
It's like the first thing that has you do is this, it shows you the baby and

06:56.680 --> 07:01.460
there's like this dark background with a patch of light and you have to wave the

07:01.460 --> 07:05.440
rattle in that patch of light as it moves around and the closer you stay in

07:05.440 --> 07:09.160
the middle of it the happier the baby gets or some shit. So, don't go towards

07:09.160 --> 07:15.800
the light! I won't get paid if you die! Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:15.800 --> 07:20.460
It was alright. I didn't get to play as much because I've been working on web

07:20.460 --> 07:29.160
pages. Anyways, um, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto IV, as usual. Still

07:29.160 --> 07:33.280
fascinated by the stupid swing set. That's what we do during lunch now. That

07:33.280 --> 07:37.200
and fire rockets at each other with friendly fire turned off so that we just

07:37.200 --> 07:42.160
fly into the air and just take damage from the impact. I don't know, we're

07:42.160 --> 07:47.680
easily amused. And then I also played over here actually the other day because

07:47.680 --> 07:51.960
I got Rob a copy for his birthday and it's odd that I'm playing his copy of

07:51.960 --> 07:56.500
the game before. I played mine, which I bought weeks ago, but Blastworks and we

07:56.500 --> 07:59.960
actually played that a bit and that was funny because people are amused by it.

07:59.960 --> 08:04.600
They're like, look at your ship! It's like taking up the whole screen! It was pretty

08:04.600 --> 08:08.200
cool. I don't know. It's actually a pretty hard shooter. I had it on like

08:08.200 --> 08:13.840
rookie, like the easiest setting. It was pretty fucking hard. So yeah, definitely

08:13.840 --> 08:17.640
really cool. And I mean just with all the download content that's out there now

08:17.640 --> 08:21.880
for it that people have made, it's nuts. The amount of stuff you can add to this

08:21.880 --> 08:25.720
and completely change the game up. And you can also cheat really bad in it

08:25.720 --> 08:29.080
because if you add your own custom ship you can change your bullet pattern to

08:29.080 --> 08:33.240
like something absolutely crazy that just blows away the entire screen. And

08:33.240 --> 08:39.320
Loki loves cheating! I do. And then I'm trying to think if I played anything

08:39.320 --> 08:44.880
else. I don't think I did. I checked out, actually I checked out that uh, I don't

08:44.880 --> 08:48.080
remember what it's called now. It's like some cooking guy can't decide what to eat or

08:48.080 --> 08:53.880
whatever. It's alright. It's you know kind of a neat concept. Not really a game but

08:53.880 --> 08:58.320
just you know recipe book. It teaches you how to do different you know techniques

08:58.320 --> 09:01.880
and stuff and there's a lot of video and stuff in there. And plus you can make

09:01.880 --> 09:07.800
your own shopping lists and stuff like that. So it's neat. I don't know. Not some

09:07.800 --> 09:14.680
the recipes were kind of limited. I wish you could add your own. But I don't know.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.880
It's it's a neat idea. It's something that needs to be done over here I think.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.960
Although there was that Gourmet Chef game that came out over here. I don't

09:21.960 --> 09:26.720
know what that is though. Lots of cooking games getting popular over here. You know

09:26.720 --> 09:29.880
I was watching Hell's Kitchen very randomly the other day and there's a

09:29.880 --> 09:32.680
Hell's Kitchen game they keep advertising during the show and I'm like

09:32.680 --> 09:37.120
that can't be fun. That's a web game. It can't be fun. The real game is coming out

09:37.120 --> 09:42.980
in September. Oh God. But the whole point of that show is to watch that guy say

09:42.980 --> 09:47.780
fucking shit to all his you know chefs. I think. Break them. I think that game is

09:47.780 --> 09:52.240
gonna be like those cafe games or like diner dash. I think it's

09:52.240 --> 09:57.840
gonna be similar to that. Which kind of sucks if it's similar to that. It should be

09:57.840 --> 10:02.200
just like kind of American Idol. What American Idol is the karaoke revolution.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.480
You know where they berate you for sucking. That's what should be like

10:05.480 --> 10:10.420
cookie mama but instead of mama will fix it. You're fucking lame! You suck! Take

10:10.420 --> 10:15.940
this game back to the store cuz you suck! I'm coming to your house and killing you

10:15.940 --> 10:22.200
and your family! Get out of my face! Fuck off! Yeah that's how that's how they show

10:22.200 --> 10:27.320
us. That might be awesome. Anything else for your gaming week? No that's it. My

10:27.320 --> 10:31.480
gaming week as Loki mentioned my birthday was this week yay and I got a

10:31.480 --> 10:35.160
copy of blast works for my birthday and we were playing that a little bit the

10:35.160 --> 10:43.440
other day and I I think it's kind of cute I like it it is a very hard shooter

10:43.440 --> 10:46.720
at first but kind of once you get the hang of it I you have to there's a

10:46.720 --> 10:49.640
certain delicate balance to it because you know you've probably heard this game

10:49.640 --> 10:54.000
by now is based on Tamiki fighters right and basically like imagine katamari

10:54.000 --> 10:58.400
damashi meets a shooter game as you destroy ships you can run over them and

10:58.400 --> 11:02.040
attach them to your ship so as you can imagine the ship gets quite huge well

11:02.040 --> 11:05.800
the trick is having to balance using the collapse button because there's a button

11:05.800 --> 11:09.520
you can press that will collapse everything and make your ship very tiny

11:09.520 --> 11:13.380
once again but if you do that then you can't add anything new to your ship so

11:13.380 --> 11:17.000
there's a very delicate balance between you know collapsing and and all that

11:17.000 --> 11:20.360
stuff that you have to do to kind of make your ship awesome but it's very

11:20.360 --> 11:24.240
amusing I enjoyed that game I'm looking forward to seeing some of the custom

11:24.240 --> 11:26.880
content because I haven't really dug into the game past a single-player

11:26.880 --> 11:32.000
campaign so hopefully more on that in the future I was feeling a little bit

11:32.000 --> 11:35.480
retro this week and it'll probably be explained why when we get into the news

11:35.480 --> 11:39.840
a little later but I decided to go pick up an old GameCube game the Mega Man

11:39.840 --> 11:43.360
anniversary collection I wanted to pick up because I was suddenly getting a

11:43.360 --> 11:46.680
hankering for playing Mega Man again and I'm sure it's you we getting tonight's

11:46.680 --> 11:50.120
news you'll understand why if you haven't already heard now I know there's

11:50.120 --> 11:52.760
a lot of people that talk smack about the GameCube version of Mega Man

11:52.760 --> 11:56.600
anniversary collection because the buttons are switched and you can't

11:56.600 --> 12:01.280
really turn them you can't turn them around very easily but look let me put

12:01.280 --> 12:05.760
it this way it cost me six bucks so it's hard to complain with that and I'm

12:05.760 --> 12:09.240
having fun it's it's the old Mega Man games all over again I was playing a

12:09.240 --> 12:13.080
little bit of Mega Man 8 because the anime scenes and Mega Man 8 are so

12:13.080 --> 12:18.120
crappy and the voiceovers and stuff like I laugh every time it's awesome but I

12:18.120 --> 12:21.640
want to go back and play the old-school Mega Man's too because you know they're

12:21.640 --> 12:23.840
all there it's like Mega Man's one through eight and then the fighting

12:23.840 --> 12:27.160
games you unlock too so the fighting games are kind of lame I got my work cut

12:27.160 --> 12:30.800
out for me yeah I mean I've played them before on maim and I think they're on

12:30.800 --> 12:34.840
game tap question mark I think they're on there I don't ever but I've

12:34.840 --> 12:38.280
definitely played them before and they're okay oh they're on the um I

12:38.280 --> 12:41.340
played them in the arcade because they're on the Ultra Kade even though

12:41.340 --> 12:46.000
they were never released here they're on Ultra Kade like years ago I played it on

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
there so there you go that was pretty much my gaming week I didn't play a

12:51.000 --> 12:56.340
whole lot else Wow guitar hero like I had to play the new Warcraft song I

12:56.340 --> 12:59.960
don't know if that's in the news tonight so we'll get to that later and all that

12:59.960 --> 13:04.120
it's good times so speaking of gaming news we'll get to that in just a moment

13:04.120 --> 13:09.120
first some quick housekeeping all games comm is currently down from what I

13:09.120 --> 13:12.680
understand there was a virus something that hit the server computer I don't

13:12.680 --> 13:15.800
know the details because I'm not much of a tech person obviously if you're

13:15.800 --> 13:18.760
listening live tonight then you figured out that you can go to all games radio

13:18.760 --> 13:23.400
comm to listen to us or you probably have the URL of the feed saved in iTunes

13:23.400 --> 13:26.720
or what have you so it's made it very easy to listen to show I'm told all

13:26.720 --> 13:29.360
games comm will be back very soon probably by the time most people are

13:29.360 --> 13:34.120
hearing this podcast so no worries there just so you know if you always want to

13:34.120 --> 13:36.920
follow what's going on with orange launch radio and if there's ever like

13:36.920 --> 13:40.400

different crappy applications that are trying to say you know hey so-and-so is

14:02.520 --> 14:07.200

14:07.200 --> 14:11.280
dating somebody or so-and-so wants you to play Scrabble with them or so-and-so

14:11.280 --> 14:14.600

14:14.600 --> 14:18.320
ever go to Facebook but it's there we do have a Facebook community there you have

14:18.320 --> 14:24.800

14:24.800 --> 14:29.640
on stuff soon I know what how descriptive huh I'm trying to build

14:29.640 --> 14:37.040
excitement things things are happening at some point so all right

14:37.040 --> 14:43.120
penny arcade Expo I'm going I know I'm going dark Sakura might be going might

14:43.120 --> 14:47.280

14:52.120 --> 14:54.800
hopefully we'll have some represent I know at least I will be there come hell

14:54.800 --> 15:00.200

15:00.200 --> 15:05.200
doing a their national sales meeting in San Francisco this year we're staying at

15:05.200 --> 15:11.400
the the Argonaut I think is what it's called it's right there off right near

15:11.400 --> 15:17.320
Pier 39 so I had the swing you know going to that because I want free stuff

15:17.320 --> 15:22.400
there are going to be crap loads of all games radio people at PAX this year from

15:22.400 --> 15:26.640
what I understand I know DMN our buddy who's on under station live now is going

15:26.640 --> 15:29.800
to be there I know Bobby Blackwell's going I'm sure folks from AGI are gonna

15:29.800 --> 15:32.880
be there I'm sure Scott's gonna be there I hear Kirk Hopkins coming in from the

15:32.880 --> 15:37.120
UK and those are just the people I talk to semi regularly I don't even yeah from

15:37.120 --> 15:40.280
the other shows I'm sure there's gonna be even more I there will inevitably be

15:40.280 --> 15:44.840
a get-together of some sort I'm sure yeah I wish I could go but I don't know

15:44.840 --> 15:49.920
if I can and we'll bring cider for you we'll see with alcohol and cider for me

15:49.920 --> 15:53.720
and the kids all right anyhow so we'll like more details on that as packs

15:53.720 --> 15:58.480
approaches let's get into some gaming news I want to Oh Bobby Blackwell says

15:58.480 --> 16:02.160
Scott is actually not going to be there because he's at Burning Man okay wait a

16:02.160 --> 16:08.200
minute he's passing up packs to go run naked in the desert come on lame actually

16:08.200 --> 16:11.400
it does sound kind of fun I don't know burning blowing stuff I was pretty fun

16:11.400 --> 16:14.600
no actually Burning Man does sound kind of cool I think that's one of the things

16:14.600 --> 16:18.020
I want to do at some point before I die is go to burning man at least once even

16:18.020 --> 16:24.360
though me plus Sun equals not good like I get all gross and my skin doesn't yeah

16:24.360 --> 16:28.280
I'd like it was a redhead let's say redheads don't do well in Sun so he

16:28.280 --> 16:32.280
starts to melt I understand that if I went to Burning Man I think I could only

16:32.280 --> 16:38.680
go for like a day so there you go all right all right let's get into the news

16:38.680 --> 16:42.280
and the beat the big exciting thing I was alluding to earlier that made me all

16:42.280 --> 16:46.820
retro this week right Logie yes definitely according to the brand new

16:46.820 --> 16:53.280
issue of Nintendo Power Mega Man 9 is set to come to the Nintendo WiiWare

16:53.280 --> 16:59.760
service and the best part about it is it's gonna be an old-school 2d and it's

16:59.760 --> 17:05.840
a kind of like the traditional Mega Man games with actually the retro graphics

17:05.840 --> 17:09.160
so it looks like something that could have been you know almost like a Mega

17:09.160 --> 17:15.240
Man you know for something like that you know or Mega Man 3 very like NES but you

17:15.240 --> 17:21.920
know better color palette type stuff so awesome and they had some screenshots

17:21.920 --> 17:27.160
that like leaked out there I think scans from the issue but it looks cool very

17:27.160 --> 17:33.280
cool and the first female boss robot yes they did had they did have a list of the

17:33.280 --> 17:37.960
different bossmen that you'd be fighting now they have magma man galaxy man plug

17:37.960 --> 17:49.080
man what does plug man plug curiosity concrete man and splash woman all right

17:49.080 --> 17:54.040
making a splash the first female boss character although I think I heard I

17:54.040 --> 17:57.840
don't know I might be getting missed next mixed up but I think in Japan one

17:57.840 --> 18:00.880
of them was a woman in a pretty prior game and it got somehow switched on the

18:00.880 --> 18:04.240
way over here to America I could be wrong on that don't call me on that but

18:04.240 --> 18:06.760
I want to say somebody was telling me that but that's still what do you guys

18:06.760 --> 18:10.440
think about this is interesting because Mega Man series is essentially taking a

18:10.440 --> 18:15.160
step backwards but in a way it's a step forwards right it's awesome I think it's

18:15.160 --> 18:19.520
a great idea mm-hmm they should do that for more stuff you know well they kind

18:19.520 --> 18:25.440
of are I mean look at bionic commando rearmed you know it's not exactly as

18:25.440 --> 18:29.720
old-school as like you know Mega Man as far as the way they're doing it but you

18:29.720 --> 18:34.200
know same type of thing it's a 2d game I I don't you know they kind of forget

18:34.200 --> 18:37.760
that a lot of times even though we do have the technology to do 3d games and

18:37.760 --> 18:42.160
stuff you don't always have to do that amen what do you think our soccer you

18:42.160 --> 18:47.160
excited about this fairly so yeah I hear all the music's gonna be like 8-bit ish

18:47.160 --> 18:51.760
and all that stuff it's gonna be great I don't know DJ Dark Knight in our chat

18:51.760 --> 18:57.520
room might not agree a worst Mega Man boss names ever so he does nothing but

18:57.520 --> 19:01.160
I'm thinking okay they're probably running out I mean they're on their

19:01.160 --> 19:04.800
ninth game at like nine bosses a game so you know a lot of the good ones have

19:04.800 --> 19:09.520
probably been used Tiger Claw says it's all about the nostalgia I kind of agree

19:09.520 --> 19:13.120
it's it's an interesting thing they're tapping into there I just think it's

19:13.120 --> 19:17.520
really kind of interesting that you know Mega Man 8 was on the PlayStation and

19:17.520 --> 19:21.120
had you know a more advanced look for that time and had the anime clips and

19:21.120 --> 19:25.120
everything it's very interesting that instead of Mega Man 9 being a follow-up

19:25.120 --> 19:29.540
and evolving that they really took a step backwards to when Mega Man was at

19:29.540 --> 19:34.040
its peak most people would tell you you know Mega Man 2 & 3 were probably the

19:34.040 --> 19:36.680
peak of the series a lot of people would tell you you know I'm sure there's some

19:36.680 --> 19:39.880
hardcore Mega Man people out there they're like no seven or five or

19:39.880 --> 19:43.200
whatever but you know I think a lot of us fondly fondly remember two and three

19:43.200 --> 19:47.720
so that's kind of interesting they're going back but I know I'm gonna check it

19:47.720 --> 19:51.960
out because if it's retro hopefully that means it's cheap and I like cheap

19:51.960 --> 19:56.880
probably not but I could see this being like ten bucks I would pay ten dollars

19:56.880 --> 20:01.400
for it if it's decent because I'm thinking it's gonna be a little spiced

20:01.400 --> 20:03.840
up it's not just gonna be strictly like I don't think it's something you could

20:03.840 --> 20:06.840
dump on a Nintendo card and play I think there'll be some extra little things to

20:06.840 --> 20:12.320
it I think it'd be cool I just hope there's I just hope there's room for it

20:12.320 --> 20:16.920
on the Wii cuz here's my other problem is I still have the whole other issue

20:16.920 --> 20:20.080
going on where I can't download anything to my Wii right now no matter how cool

20:20.080 --> 20:25.120
this sounds so this is this is me being tempted right here but hopefully our

20:25.120 --> 20:31.280
space concerns will be addressed soon so couple more weeks until our Wi-Fi fixed

20:31.280 --> 20:35.200
so I can download so you can actually download a Wii games yeah there you go

20:35.200 --> 20:38.440
telling you a castle crash or not castle crashes yeah that game is gonna be

20:38.440 --> 20:43.120
awesome too but that defend your castle awesome WiiWare game

20:43.120 --> 20:47.480
Sharon said chat says soon we're gonna have pencil man and cloth man hey I

20:47.480 --> 20:51.320
don't know pencil man might be kind of funny like he shoots erasers oh it's

20:51.320 --> 20:55.880
like okay they've got to always have a you know a villain that's you know fire

20:55.880 --> 20:59.680
base so they're like running out of different words for fire in there like

20:59.680 --> 21:07.420
magma man and you know fire man heat man hot man way go man way go man was cool

21:07.420 --> 21:12.000
though he was like the coolest of the email is pretty cool I don't know I'm

21:12.000 --> 21:18.280
old-school I like fire man I say they make a new mega man game just have all

21:18.280 --> 21:22.000
of the different bosses in there like all of them and they have all their

21:22.000 --> 21:25.640
levels and yeah just have like well not necessarily playing all the bosses but

21:25.640 --> 21:28.080
just have all the levels from all the other games too so you can use that

21:28.080 --> 21:30.160
something from that's what the anniversary collection should have been

21:30.160 --> 21:33.200
you should use like you can use the weapons from like making man 8 and make

21:33.200 --> 21:38.840
a man 1 and you know mix it all up that'd be awesome and ossifer makes the

21:38.840 --> 21:45.240
mandatory booby man reference j-rod says toaster man there you go j-rod says

21:45.240 --> 21:50.280
powdered toast man all right I was just thinking all right enough enough I do

21:50.280 --> 21:54.400
not want the chat room filling up with blank man or whatever there all right

21:54.400 --> 21:58.600
um no blank man was already done was there a blank man really there was a

21:58.600 --> 22:03.720
blank man movie all right well guess what if you have been hiding under a

22:03.720 --> 22:08.960
freaking rock this week I don't know if you heard but Diablo 3 was announced and

22:08.960 --> 22:12.360
we're playing a little bit of it here in studio right now a clip of what this

22:12.360 --> 22:18.760
game looks like and you know places thick with the stench of ghouls what can

22:18.760 --> 22:22.600
I say it looks like Diablo 2 and Diablo 1 but like much prettier it's obvious

22:22.600 --> 22:26.800
this this game has evolved quite a bit this game of course was unveiled at

22:26.800 --> 22:32.840
blizzard's recent event over in France the worldwide invitational and tons of

22:32.840 --> 22:36.320
stuff was leaked there was a trailer there's this 20-minute gameplay clip

22:36.320 --> 22:39.800
we're looking at here in studio right now what do you guys think of Diablo 3

22:39.800 --> 22:43.760
I know you guys don't play a whole lot of PC games but what do you guys think

22:43.760 --> 22:48.200
that's pretty cool I'd have to check it out I mean I never played any of the

22:48.200 --> 22:53.600
others but I've had this one I played a little bit of I think Diablo like back

22:53.600 --> 22:57.840
in the day when I had to demo and stuff for it and it was fun it was one of

22:57.840 --> 23:00.920
those games you could sit there and play for a while you level up some and then

23:00.920 --> 23:05.120
stop and go back to it later it's kind of like the whole grinding part of World

23:05.120 --> 23:08.400
of Warcraft except you don't actually have any well as far as I'm working

23:08.400 --> 23:12.040
because I only played the demo like huge quests you have to go on it's just grind

23:12.040 --> 23:15.360
grind grind grind grind oh look I'm super powerful now kill kill kill and

23:15.360 --> 23:18.560
you do have quest but part of the really cool thing about the old Diablos is that

23:18.560 --> 23:22.040
everything was randomized you know all the day by introducing a barbarian I'm

23:22.040 --> 23:24.600
gonna turn that off because now the guy is talking about the barbarian class on

23:24.600 --> 23:28.960
it um all the dungeons were randomized so it was like you were playing like a

23:28.960 --> 23:31.720
new game every time that was kind of one of the cool things about it

23:31.720 --> 23:39.280
Guild Wars does that but yeah that's true huh so very cool but you know I

23:39.280 --> 23:42.320
don't know Diablos just different Diablos not really an MMO but it is

23:42.320 --> 23:45.160
something you can experience with tons of other people which is kind of cool I

23:45.160 --> 23:48.200
do like the four player co-op that they're gonna have in there oh yeah

23:48.200 --> 23:53.120
because then Diablo to only go up to two player co-op I think thing I remember so

23:53.120 --> 23:56.320
there you have it Diablo 3 officially announced this week and there's just

23:56.320 --> 23:59.240
their stuff all over the internet on this if you want the official word

23:59.240 --> 24:03.400
Diablo 3.com is where it's I just go to any blizzard site that whole splash

24:03.400 --> 24:08.480
screen that was being teased all week long was there as far as when this comes

24:08.480 --> 24:12.120
out who knows because we still have Starcraft 2 on the list we still have

24:12.120 --> 24:17.920
wrath of the Lich King when sometime that's really SSJ 100 Matt says it'll

24:17.920 --> 24:22.700
be on my Hanukkah list for 2011 it's probably not a bad bet I would say

24:22.700 --> 24:26.920
maybe 2010 I think we'll get Starcraft 2 next year and probably Diablo 3 the year

24:26.920 --> 24:30.400
after I think I think Diablo 3 probably come out around the same time as

24:30.400 --> 24:35.760
Starcraft 2 I think you may have one in the fall one spring j-rod says Diablo

24:35.760 --> 24:39.680
was cool until people started cheating to make their own loot and I hear that's

24:39.680 --> 24:43.360
a real problem that played Diablo 2 on battle net this is why I don't like to

24:43.360 --> 24:46.880
play games except with friends you know because I know that friends won't cheat

24:46.880 --> 24:50.560
or olr listeners I don't know you know cheating sometimes it can be fun because

24:50.560 --> 24:55.000
like with red alert command and conquer red alert I love that stuff man they

24:55.000 --> 24:58.400
especially when you found out about the whole rules I and I file and you can

24:58.400 --> 25:02.120
make your own units by like combining stuff that made the game even more fun

25:02.120 --> 25:05.720
for me but it's like if you and I agree okay we're gonna play this game or you

25:05.720 --> 25:08.240
cheat the hell out of it and just have fun with it that's one thing I mean

25:08.240 --> 25:10.960
that's cool because we're both on the same page but you know if I've worked

25:10.960 --> 25:14.520
really hard to like level this character and then some stranger pops in my room

25:14.520 --> 25:19.560
and dumps all this shit in my you know thing that he's cheated to get or shown

25:19.560 --> 25:23.120
off or whatever that's just dumb yeah I mean like what are you trying to prove

25:23.120 --> 25:26.680
the sort of the problem that we had I guess at the last Ragnarok server we

25:26.680 --> 25:30.720
were on that people were a sort of exploiting a little problem in there

25:30.720 --> 25:34.840
duplicating items and things and messing up the economy and and as a result all

25:34.840 --> 25:42.280
of us suffered for it you know so yeah cheaters suck I think that there's not

25:42.280 --> 25:46.100
a bar is appropriate to be cheating yeah what Matt's talking about you know like

25:46.100 --> 25:48.320
you know and what they do at work and everything when they're you know

25:48.320 --> 25:51.840
whatever that's that's one thing is you all agree you're gonna cheat and the

25:51.840 --> 25:55.080
whole point you're having fun with the exploits but you know these other

25:55.080 --> 25:58.880
a-holes that come on and try to ruin other people's you know legit experiences

25:58.880 --> 26:02.720
suck well I would say it's it's less of a cheat more of a mod because you're

26:02.720 --> 26:06.320
just modifying the game and in order to play someone because this is back in the

26:06.320 --> 26:12.400
day when I was playing someone red alert over you know a fucking modem so you

26:12.400 --> 26:17.100
know we would share the same file back and forth and then basically play this

26:17.100 --> 26:21.360
you know kind of hacked version on both computers which was pretty fun actually

26:21.360 --> 26:27.560
especially with you know I made the super fast tanks and Einstein the shot

26:27.560 --> 26:32.400
lightning and you know the suicide bombers and stuff like that that's great

26:32.400 --> 26:37.240
looking in chat here hit stun says funny I play with olr listeners because they

26:37.240 --> 26:40.680
hack just as much as I do well you know again if you all agree you're going to

26:40.680 --> 26:44.760
hack then you know that's one thing but it's just when you try to kind of cross

26:44.760 --> 26:48.840
the line there where you're an ass if you if you're trying to ruin other

26:48.840 --> 26:53.480
people's experience so but that's I hey you know what Diablo 3 is definitely

26:53.480 --> 26:56.880
this you think it's going to break the Diablo 2 record I want to say if I

26:56.880 --> 27:02.680
remember right Diablo 2 has the best PC game launch ever even above World of

27:02.680 --> 27:06.000
Warcraft it sold Diablo 2 sold like a million copies in its first week is

27:06.000 --> 27:13.240
Diablo 3 gonna top that or is PC gaming dead I don't know I heard you know read

27:13.240 --> 27:19.160
enough fangasming on my live journal to make me think that if that's just a

27:19.160 --> 27:23.280
small portion of the community I think that it would be big I think it's

27:23.280 --> 27:26.160
definitely any of Diablo 2 for running for its money and I don't think PC

27:26.160 --> 27:29.960
gaming is dead I think that I think there's enough people I think gaming is

27:29.960 --> 27:33.800
mapping here yeah I don't even think it's necessarily you know there's

27:33.800 --> 27:37.960
certainly a hardcore audience very into PC gaming but I'll tell you what you

27:37.960 --> 27:41.840
know love them or hate them whoever you are in the PC gaming community Blizzard

27:41.840 --> 27:47.120
gets people to the PC you know with games like this and World of Warcraft

27:47.120 --> 27:50.480
there's other games too I'm not just saying like only Blizzard but you know

27:50.480 --> 27:54.520
they're they they get people excited about it that you know you only see that

27:54.520 --> 27:58.680
level of excitement for things like Metal Gear Solid 4 and so on and so on

27:58.680 --> 28:05.560
all right so Diablo 3 coming soon well going back to other Blizzard news there

28:05.560 --> 28:10.480
you know there were some people who were afraid that Diablo 3 would steal

28:10.480 --> 28:17.600
World of Warcraft players but Blizzard really isn't worried about that because

28:17.600 --> 28:21.400
well the thing is they're actually just not concerned about losing the revenue

28:21.400 --> 28:25.240
because if they go from one of their projects to another of their projects

28:25.240 --> 28:30.760
they're still getting money from it but they said that it's not going to be as

28:30.760 --> 28:34.120
big of a crossover between the communities because they're different

28:34.120 --> 28:38.920
you know types of game but they do hope that plenty of the World of Warcraft

28:38.920 --> 28:42.920
players would be interested in Diablo 3 I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of

28:42.920 --> 28:46.440
people to play both but I think some I think a lot of people will take a siesta

28:46.440 --> 28:51.440
from Warcraft for a little while to play Diablo 3 well either way Blizzard gets

28:51.440 --> 28:54.520
their money yeah true then they'll get it twice because how many of those

28:54.520 --> 28:58.720
people will actually let their accounts expire probably not a lot no probably

28:58.720 --> 29:01.680
not because you know I can't because you know Irene might call me and be all Rob

29:01.680 --> 29:07.240
Cara and I'm gonna have to drop Diablo 3 to go run Cara's and again so Curtis and

29:07.240 --> 29:12.280
chat is addressing the whole issue about PC gaming and he says I have portal on

29:12.280 --> 29:16.600
my PC because unfortunately I'm still stuck with a ps2 and can't afford next

29:16.600 --> 29:20.360
gen which you know I think there's a lot of people still doing PC gaming because

29:20.360 --> 29:24.840
of that but I gotta be honest I look at a game like Diablo 3 and I'm going I'm

29:24.840 --> 29:27.440
probably gonna have to upgrade my computer in order to be able to play

29:27.440 --> 29:30.000
that I don't know Blizzard sometimes pretty good at getting the tech

29:30.000 --> 29:33.640
requirements pretty low but I'm a little worried I'm gonna have to upgrade the

29:33.640 --> 29:36.240
computer to be able to play that so if you have upgrade the computer isn't that

29:36.240 --> 29:40.560
just like you know my soul by a system but it's like buying a few systems yeah

29:40.560 --> 29:43.560
but I understand that you know some people want to put it all I want you

29:43.560 --> 29:47.480
know then invest all the money in your best machine I think that's the big

29:47.480 --> 29:50.000
reason why there are a lot of people really into PC gaming yeah kind of the

29:50.000 --> 29:55.880
same it's the same thing yet opposite for me because because I've upgraded my

29:55.880 --> 30:01.120
system I have to buy more PC games because you know what's the point in

30:01.120 --> 30:06.000
upgrading it that much to play games if you're not gonna play games on it so

30:06.000 --> 30:09.080
well I I don't think Blizzard is really gonna be losing any Wow players to

30:09.080 --> 30:11.920
Diablo I don't think Blizzard will really start losing Wow players until

30:11.920 --> 30:15.760
other MMOs come out that really step up to challenge them which you know Age of

30:15.760 --> 30:19.040
Conan is probably done better than most so far and there's others you know I

30:19.040 --> 30:22.640
think Warhammer is gonna be coming soon I've heard a lot of buzz about that and

30:22.640 --> 30:27.160
eventually Wow 2 or World of Starcraft which in five years is probably

30:27.160 --> 30:34.160
inevitable so we'll see what they need is like world of dead or alive keep on

30:34.160 --> 30:39.640
dreaming it got you man he he can do it one thing that's gonna be coming

30:39.640 --> 30:43.160
hopefully pretty soon here and we've been hearing about this for a while now

30:43.160 --> 30:50.800
is the trophy system for the PlayStation 3 kind of their answer to the

30:50.800 --> 30:55.440
achievements that are on Xbox 360 well there are some pictures that have leaked

30:55.440 --> 31:00.040
out supposedly of this trophy system they show that you're actually not gonna

31:00.040 --> 31:04.680
have gamer points but they're gonna have different trophies available in bronze

31:04.680 --> 31:09.960
silver gold and platinum and you're in the trophies and different ways

31:09.960 --> 31:14.360
throughout the game and stuff there's also some interesting stuff they're

31:14.360 --> 31:19.560
showing the in-game cross-media bar kind of showing how you can compare your

31:19.560 --> 31:24.000
trophies with other people and you know kind of the same kind of stuff we've

31:24.000 --> 31:28.720
come to take for granted with like the Xbox 360 where you can see who's online

31:28.720 --> 31:33.600
your friends listen that kind of stuff so it's all supposed to come down in the

31:33.600 --> 31:39.960
2.4 firmware so whenever the hell that comes out so basically it sounds like

31:39.960 --> 31:43.360
the achievement system I don't know it kind of reminds me of like burnout you

31:43.360 --> 31:46.320
know that's it we're like if you get a certain time you get a gold if you get a

31:46.320 --> 31:50.000
certain you know higher time it's a silver and so on for a bronze they're

31:50.000 --> 31:53.560
gonna have that type of well I think what's gonna be is lay some difficulty

31:53.560 --> 31:59.000
for each trophy it's not going to be like you know I guess sort of like that

31:59.000 --> 32:02.520
but you wouldn't be able to like say get golden and get all the trophies below it

32:02.520 --> 32:06.040
it would be just like different things like finish level one bronze trophy

32:06.040 --> 32:09.520
finish the game you know gold trophy or something like that gotcha I read you

32:09.520 --> 32:12.720
some more comments from chat chat orange lunch radio.com live on this Sunday

32:12.720 --> 32:16.520
night j-rod says trophies and achievements god no I can't juggle that

32:16.520 --> 32:22.580
between two systems achievement whore also going back to the last story you

32:22.580 --> 32:26.040
were joking that idagaki should get in on World of Warcraft because for some

32:26.040 --> 32:29.680
reason idagaki has been like the big thing to talk about on shows lately and

32:29.680 --> 32:33.860
I thought this comment was kind of funny from Amaze Satsuma he says doesn't

32:33.860 --> 32:41.480
Conan equal world of dead or alive parts it is violent and there are you know

32:41.480 --> 32:48.480
well-endowed women on there so possibly parts yeah parts all right well you know

32:48.480 --> 32:52.640
all these games are pretty epic and there is another epic series that could

32:52.640 --> 32:58.840
be getting some more epicness at e3 this year and that series is God of War and

32:58.840 --> 33:03.720
you know you know it's inevitable that God of War 3 is going to come out

33:03.720 --> 33:08.000
sometime for the PlayStation 3 but were you guys thinking that it might be this

33:08.000 --> 33:13.320
soon well apparently one of the Eurogamer affiliates Eurogamer.pt has

33:13.320 --> 33:19.480
run a report that God of War 3 is going to be shown at e3 this next month this

33:19.480 --> 33:24.080
was from a Sony rep at the interactive digital I'm sorry interactive and

33:24.080 --> 33:29.040
digital entertainment festival going on in Paris right now so even though this

33:29.040 --> 33:34.400
is a rumor status I don't know this to me this is one of those rumors that yeah

33:34.400 --> 33:37.480
you could probably bank on something like this I mean like even if even if

33:37.480 --> 33:42.000
this site Eurogamer or whatever hadn't run this I would put my money on you

33:42.000 --> 33:44.960
know God of War 3 is going to be announced eventually they're gonna

33:44.960 --> 33:48.280
they're gonna have like some sort of trailer or something it could be just

33:48.280 --> 33:53.800
all cutscene or whatever that says you know God of War 3 coming 2009 or

33:53.800 --> 33:57.000
something like that you know well apparently rumors are already saying

33:57.000 --> 34:01.160
that the launch is going to be next Christmas but some are actually saying

34:01.160 --> 34:05.240
a more placeholder release of next March I kind of see this if a trailer is

34:05.240 --> 34:08.520
unveiled which I don't see why it wouldn't be because this is one of Sony's

34:08.520 --> 34:13.000
biggest franchises it's going to be in the vein of the early early Halo 3

34:13.000 --> 34:15.760
trailers where it's going to show you like you know there's going to be some

34:15.760 --> 34:20.880
epic music and then you know some girl talking like you know in a land far away

34:20.880 --> 34:24.000
we need your help or whatever shit they're going to talk in the thing and

34:24.000 --> 34:28.840
then you'll see suddenly at the very end of the trailer Kratos's face in HD and

34:28.840 --> 34:34.440
it's going to be like oh my god and then God of War 3 2009 and that's going to be

34:34.440 --> 34:38.920
it I mean you know it's kind of predictable at this point where then

34:38.920 --> 34:41.880
again if it is Sony they could say it's coming out this Christmas and then just

34:41.880 --> 34:46.360
keep pushing it back until it's the Christmas 2009 it is the Sony way isn't

34:46.360 --> 34:50.960
it did you hear about the other rumor that they're saying that Kratos is gonna

34:50.960 --> 34:56.160
be a hidden character in Soulcalibur 4 on the PlayStation 3 I had heard that I

34:56.160 --> 34:58.760
think it was on the lineup for tonight but I got cut because we're gonna be

34:58.760 --> 35:02.440
long otherwise but yeah I'd heard about that in that weird uh it'd be

35:02.440 --> 35:05.400
interesting to be something that they could probably slip in there for e3 or

35:05.400 --> 35:08.120
whatever since the game comes out a few weeks after that but I would think isn't

35:08.120 --> 35:12.480
if that is true wouldn't wouldn't word of that already slipped out now not

35:12.480 --> 35:15.680
really I mean look at the you know they've been announcing stuff each week

35:15.680 --> 35:20.440
you know like a little tidbits you know doing different screens like they were

35:20.440 --> 35:24.200
talking about the tag system that's supposedly in there now there's another

35:24.200 --> 35:28.560
thing I saw the other day for the custom the character creator where you can

35:28.560 --> 35:33.400
basically create they have someone made like a solid snake and then our old

35:33.400 --> 35:41.960
snake basically and re are Ryu Ryu from Ninja Gaiden so if you're the claw and

35:41.960 --> 35:46.320
Chad says that's three games in three years it's like Tony Hawk or Madden and

35:46.320 --> 35:49.600
then I'm thinking wait a minute there's the PSP one but J rod jumps in and says

35:49.600 --> 35:53.040
yeah but the PSP one doesn't count for most people I heard the PSP one was

35:53.040 --> 35:55.520
actually pretty good I didn't play it myself I can see them probably in the

35:55.520 --> 36:00.240
guy probably will port the PSP one to the PlayStation 2 before the third one

36:00.240 --> 36:06.480
comes out hmm we'll see because they've been doing that quite often well I'm I

36:06.480 --> 36:09.760
think it's inevitable God of War 3 at some point we'll just see if we get a

36:09.760 --> 36:16.640
teaser at e3 or not well there is some other news that should probably be

36:16.640 --> 36:21.440
pretty exciting I'm actually kind of exciting about exciting about it excited

36:21.440 --> 36:28.860
about this is Nintendo Power put up an image of a photo taken of the

36:28.860 --> 36:33.080
Castlevania game for Wii and it looks like a fighting game and not a

36:33.080 --> 36:40.000
platformer but it said so far you should be able to well at least it's a it's a

36:40.000 --> 36:43.620
rumored that you should be able to play Simon alucard

36:43.620 --> 36:50.040
Shannoah Marie Renard and Dracula it do it better it better have Richter in it

36:50.040 --> 36:54.320
that's all I'm saying but doesn't look like a it's like a fighting game it was

36:54.320 --> 36:58.880
like a family so caliber is so so is this Konami's response to Soul Calibur

36:58.880 --> 37:05.160
maybe gs68 calls it fightervania and then facepalms in our chat room it's

37:05.160 --> 37:09.760
Castlevania judgment I think was the name of the name III I want I want to

37:09.760 --> 37:15.000
play it here's here's my my quandary with this is that this looks like one of

37:15.000 --> 37:20.400
those things that could be really really really freaking awesome or really

37:20.400 --> 37:24.480
really really terrible you know what I mean like and I'm just kind of worried

37:24.480 --> 37:29.720
it's going to be terrible but I have I hope I'm hopeful because these are some

37:29.720 --> 37:37.200
great characters here and and shapely legs what do you think now here's the

37:37.200 --> 37:41.280
thing aren't don't most of the Castlevania characters play kind of

37:41.280 --> 37:43.660
similar like what's going to differentiate all these different

37:43.660 --> 37:48.760
characters Richter had different moves remember he had the the backwards double

37:48.760 --> 37:52.360
jump and he had no he had the well if you go by somebody in the night he had

37:52.360 --> 37:57.100
like the double jump and then the the one where he leaps up and then the the

37:57.100 --> 38:02.260
backflip that would let you go like an extra space and a half and like if you

38:02.260 --> 38:05.760
put Maria and I don't know if she'd have her crybaby attack from when she was a

38:05.760 --> 38:09.280
little girl I did see a screenshot that they had Maria in it yeah there's a

38:09.280 --> 38:13.760
second screenshot that was floating around out there also you know what

38:13.760 --> 38:17.920
would be kind of cool is if certain boss characters were kind of downgraded to

38:17.920 --> 38:21.600
you know the playable fighters in this so you could like play as the grim

38:21.600 --> 38:26.440
reaper or you could play as I don't know the vampire bat maybe not or Medusa or

38:26.440 --> 38:29.160
you know some of those like old-school Castlevania bosses that might be kind of

38:29.160 --> 38:33.040
fun and it's just me I think that'd be fun to play as like the grim reaper as a

38:33.040 --> 38:39.880
character well or Dracula I would think that if Dracula is in a Dracula isn't it

38:39.880 --> 38:45.280
as a boss bosses are always playable once you unlock them though they should

38:45.280 --> 38:51.320
have they should have shaft the dark priest shaft so like and they're like

38:51.320 --> 38:57.200
little text exchange should be like he's like yeah we hear your one bad and then

38:57.200 --> 39:01.960
you shut your mouth I I hope that they have horrendous voice acting like the

39:01.960 --> 39:07.280
old-school PlayStation Symphony of the night game that would rock I just think

39:07.280 --> 39:12.800
that Simon had pretty hair in that one picture I imagine this is something that

39:12.800 --> 39:17.480
will get a trailer of at e3 so hopefully we'll get a little more feeling about if

39:17.480 --> 39:21.400
this is gonna suck or not I again I'm hopeful but it is one of those things

39:21.400 --> 39:25.320
where it's like boy they could really screw this up if they wanted to so I I

39:25.320 --> 39:28.760
hope they took the time to get it right we'll see yeah unfortunately can't see

39:28.760 --> 39:33.440
that the track record for spin-off games have been that great for the like

39:33.440 --> 39:37.720
especially on the Wii because I mean look look what they've done Soulcalibur

39:37.720 --> 39:45.160
legends absolute shit there was well Mortal Kombat sort of did like a little

39:45.160 --> 39:49.440
action game which wasn't that great the Shaolin monks but the Shaolin monks was

39:49.440 --> 39:52.560
kind of cool but what sucked was that sub-zero mythologies game yeah those

39:52.560 --> 39:57.360
games yeah Shaolin monks was alright what it was what was the Tekken game

39:57.360 --> 40:02.880
Tekken oh the oh god there was the spin-off with Nina right there was death

40:02.880 --> 40:13.440
by degrees yeah oh yeah that was shit guilty gear to overture it's alright but

40:13.440 --> 40:18.400
it's kind of like 99 nights a bit and then trying to think there's another one

40:18.400 --> 40:24.360
there but yeah it hasn't been that great so cross our fingers dark Tetsuya says I

40:24.360 --> 40:28.040
want to play as grant from Castlevania 3 he could climb on the freaking walls

40:28.040 --> 40:31.280
and ceiling I'll be kind of Japanese version instead of just stabbing with

40:31.280 --> 40:36.120
the knife he actually threw knives see this a lot better these are the kind of

40:36.120 --> 40:39.280
characters that need to be in the game you know and I have say you know we

40:39.280 --> 40:42.640
might be talking negatively about this game already has a very cautious but by

40:42.640 --> 40:49.240
all means please Konami prove us wrong make us eat our words please please feel

40:49.240 --> 40:53.020
free you know what the graphics don't look that bad so if they want to do say

40:53.020 --> 40:58.440
another 2d Castlevania game for the Wii which would be awesome they should do

40:58.440 --> 41:01.540
that all right hey let's travel around the world and talk about some games

41:01.540 --> 41:05.860
coming out a little sooner than e3 like this week yeah if only Castlevania

41:05.860 --> 41:08.480
judgment we're coming out this week because this week sucks for game

41:08.480 --> 41:13.560
releases isn't this usually a dead period though right before you get a lot

41:13.560 --> 41:19.400
of little bit yeah so basically today you have guitar hero Aerosmith which I'm

41:19.400 --> 41:23.400
sure a lot of people picked up other than today there's really a whole lot of

41:23.400 --> 41:31.120
nothing elements on PC which is some puzzle game supreme ruler 2020 also

41:31.120 --> 41:39.800
another PC game that's a strategy title let's see the immortals of Terra I have

41:39.800 --> 41:45.840
no idea what that is journey to the center of the earth for the DS which is

41:45.840 --> 41:51.360
based on the new movie that's coming out here they keep trailering like crazy one

41:51.360 --> 41:59.160
versus 100 the only game with Bob Saget in it it's for the DS until they make a

41:59.160 --> 42:02.840
full house game yes which will never happen

42:02.840 --> 42:07.680
rugu on purely sorry about that I'm looking at a banner god damn these

42:07.680 --> 42:12.560
banner ads that make noise I hate that anyways rugu on PC cool independent

42:12.560 --> 42:17.160
games so that's worth checking out purpals on the Wii yet another cat

42:17.160 --> 42:24.120
raising sim or cats raising you sim Gears of War the refresh as they're

42:24.120 --> 42:27.600
calling it basically the re-release of Gears of War with some extra content and

42:27.600 --> 42:35.640
a new price point of $39.99 that's on the 360 dakati moto on the DS motorcycle

42:35.640 --> 42:42.840
racing game amf bullying pin busters that's on the DS as well hail to the

42:42.840 --> 42:50.120
chimp on the ps3 the only game that's actually cool this week trauma center

42:50.120 --> 42:57.920
under the knife to coming out for the DS and that's it

42:57.920 --> 43:05.840
wow some comments from chat kdog 96 asks hasn't won versus 100 being canceled no

43:05.840 --> 43:10.000
I know I think the show was oh the show show was but you know if they made the

43:10.000 --> 43:13.240
game I think they're kind of stuck releasing it yeah the game has been

43:13.240 --> 43:17.240
pushed back a while some comments on guitar hero Aerosmith dead man walking

43:17.240 --> 43:21.680
in chat says guitar hero Aerosmith is awful j rod says guitar hero Aerosmith

43:21.680 --> 43:25.160
has a great track list but I can't get myself to support Activision milking

43:25.160 --> 43:31.520
that franchise you know there's a large part of me that really wants to get

43:31.520 --> 43:36.440
guitar hero Aerosmith but I cannot justify $60 on it I just can't so I'm

43:36.440 --> 43:40.040
hoping it comes down to price so you can complain at my house oh that's right

43:40.040 --> 43:43.560
cuz Dan's gonna get it huh I mean it's a good thing that they're releasing you

43:43.560 --> 43:47.320
know music games and stuff like that but I think more than one release years too

43:47.320 --> 43:50.680
much even with DDR if they were releasing like two or three games a year

43:50.680 --> 43:55.720
that would be overkill I think all right let's head on over to Japan and look at

43:55.720 --> 43:58.480
some of the release dates over there and honestly guys not a whole lot coming out

43:58.480 --> 44:01.640
in Japan this week it's a pretty slow week there is one big game coming out

44:01.640 --> 44:05.800
though it's on the PlayStation 3 its initial D extreme stage so if you're a

44:05.800 --> 44:08.840
fan of those initial D racing games this is a good week for you in Japan that

44:08.840 --> 44:11.600
game is coming out on July the 3rd otherwise there are some price

44:11.600 --> 44:14.640
reductions I mean chant arm is finally getting a price reduction on the

44:14.640 --> 44:19.160
PlayStation 3 as well as ninja guidance Sigma and ranch and clank future so

44:19.160 --> 44:22.320
there are some price reductions let's check out some of the other systems I

44:22.320 --> 44:26.680
know there's nothing coming on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan on the Wii Akko

44:26.680 --> 44:31.760
de Pon ikisama Horiyuki is coming out and Jawa mammoth toe hitsumu no ishi is

44:31.760 --> 44:36.600
also coming out I have no idea what either of those games are but I'm

44:36.600 --> 44:41.320
imagine Akko de Pon is probably some type of puzzle game if I'm not mistaken

44:41.320 --> 44:45.640
yeah it looks like oh it's a board game so board game translation for the

44:45.640 --> 44:49.240
Nintendo Wii probably not a game we really play here on this side of the

44:49.240 --> 44:52.960
ocean I'm looking at the handheld system actually quickly looking at PlayStation

44:52.960 --> 45:02.440
2 some other price reductions there also L no kitsu to invisible memories comes

45:02.440 --> 45:06.560
out on the PlayStation 2 it has a limited edition as well it's an

45:06.560 --> 45:13.160
adventure game can't tell much about this but it has school girls in it well

45:13.160 --> 45:18.440
I could be anything exactly I could be anything seriously looking at the

45:18.440 --> 45:22.000
handhelds because there's usually stuff on the Nintendo DS even in a slow

45:22.000 --> 45:29.440
newsweek I don't see a lot of big game names here but I do show a game called

45:29.440 --> 45:34.240
the nashi no gamae from Square Enix is coming out trying to figure out what

45:34.240 --> 45:40.480
that game is action-adventure game gosh that box art makes it look like some

45:40.480 --> 45:44.160
type of survival horror that might be kind of cool it probably is from Square

45:44.160 --> 45:47.880
Enix that might be kind of neat actually pinky Street

45:47.880 --> 45:52.040
Kira Kira music hour comes out from dimple entertainment this week on the

45:52.040 --> 45:56.840
Nintendo DS and it does look like a music game it's a rhythm action game

45:56.840 --> 46:00.920
based on a series of three touch band panels that you interact with while the

46:00.920 --> 46:05.960
beat rolls by you use the Nintendo DS sideways with a touch panel on one side

46:05.960 --> 46:09.400
for the game and the other side showing a full body view of your dancer and her

46:09.400 --> 46:17.080
competition woohoo so it's like a dance music game and lastly on the PSP in

46:17.080 --> 46:22.540
Japan this week we're gonna see if there's anything new Oh bleach heat the

46:22.540 --> 46:27.080
soul for gets a price reduction and moves into best hits and the Namco

46:27.080 --> 46:31.760
museum battle collection expands to an Asia wide release this week and not just

46:31.760 --> 46:37.160
Japan more bleach I was gonna say I have a friend who's touring around in Japan

46:37.160 --> 46:41.120
right now and he asked me if I wanted anything from Japan so I was gonna have

46:41.120 --> 46:45.680
them pick me up a copy on PlayStation 3 of battle Fantasia nice which is that

46:45.680 --> 46:50.200
really cool looking fighting game I wanted to play that one of my other

46:50.200 --> 46:54.320
friends is planning on importing it so hopefully I get that and I can bring it

46:54.320 --> 46:59.040
in and we can do it on Justin TV or some by the way in two weeks in Japan since

46:59.040 --> 47:02.120
we were talking about God of War earlier God of War chains of Olympus finally

47:02.120 --> 47:05.040
comes out in Japan on July 10th something to look forward to there there

47:05.040 --> 47:14.760
you have it Japan release dates well for the UK there's a few things on the 30th

47:14.760 --> 47:19.800
actually go view is coming out for PSP and then with the start of the month

47:19.800 --> 47:24.880
we've got on the second Dance Dance Revolution hottest party on Wii Wolf of

47:24.880 --> 47:28.440
the battlefield a commando 3 for PlayStation 3 on the third and then on

47:28.440 --> 47:34.480
the fourth is Arkanoid DS space invaders extreme for DS and PSP The Incredible

47:34.480 --> 47:39.520
Hulk on Wii and wall-e on damn near everything else and we love golf only

47:39.520 --> 47:44.040
wait it's not dancing stage hottest party this is dance dance revolution

47:44.040 --> 47:48.920
that's kind of strange okay surprise it because I thought they called it dancing

47:48.920 --> 47:51.680
stage over there why is it that they call it dancing and stage over there

47:51.680 --> 47:55.400
anyways evolution is a taboo term to use in marketing from what I understand

47:55.400 --> 48:00.320
haha I know why and if I'm right also back in the 80s you actually couldn't

48:00.320 --> 48:04.360
use ninja like for example Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was Teenage Mutant

48:04.360 --> 48:10.760
Hero Turtles we got weird stuff over here too so you know like you know bag

48:10.760 --> 48:15.320
is a cigarette over there but over here means something much different you know

48:15.320 --> 48:20.600
what I mean there's there's little and a bundle of sticks yes that's funny

48:20.600 --> 48:26.800
revolution hey anyways so there's some other stuff coming out a little bit

48:26.800 --> 48:32.360
later than next week but being announced from Nintendo some pretty exciting stuff

48:32.360 --> 48:36.240
actually a brand new Wario Land game which I believe we talked about this a

48:36.240 --> 48:39.120
little bit at least at leaked out that was coming

48:39.120 --> 48:46.240
Wario Land shake it which is gonna be kind of like imagine Super Paper Mario a

48:46.240 --> 48:50.800
little bit it's a classic side-scrolling game that will probably have you shaking

48:50.800 --> 48:57.280
the Wii remote for random things but you know is basically I guess your quest to

48:57.280 --> 49:02.840
collect money you know which most Wario games are it seems like also there's

49:02.840 --> 49:08.760
going to be Kirby Superstar Ultra which is a DS remake of the Super Nintendo

49:08.760 --> 49:14.240
game interesting was that the one with like all the mini games in it it's also

49:14.240 --> 49:20.760
got many games in it yeah Wow okay and there's also I had that game

49:20.760 --> 49:28.360
mystery case files millionaire like air as in you know errors anyways and that

49:28.360 --> 49:33.080
is a mystery game that I guess is a PC franchise that they're now bringing to

49:33.080 --> 49:41.800
the DS so those let's see I believe the September 25th for Kirby Superstar Ultra

49:41.800 --> 49:50.000
and 29th for September 29th for mystery case files millionaire and I want to say

49:50.000 --> 49:58.440
that Wario Wario Land is around the 29th as well and then also there's Super

49:58.440 --> 50:04.280
Mario sluggers coming out on the 29th of August if I remember correctly some of

50:04.280 --> 50:08.000
the some part of that last week of August the Tuesday now what I think is

50:08.000 --> 50:10.880
interesting about this list is that you know it's interesting that Nintendo is

50:10.880 --> 50:14.240
announcing this ahead of e3 because it's usually a type of stuff you'd reveal at

50:14.240 --> 50:19.520
e3 but then I noticed a couple things a that list ends in October so there are

50:19.520 --> 50:23.080
November and December releases are still a question mark so there might be some

50:23.080 --> 50:27.040
big bombshell in there and it doesn't really even end in October it ends yeah

50:27.040 --> 50:31.280
basically at October yeah because it's all September stuff because I don't know

50:31.280 --> 50:35.120
like you know Wario sounds kind of cool go Kirby sure it has a lot of diehard

50:35.120 --> 50:39.520
fans but there's not really that OMG title you know there you know it's also

50:39.520 --> 50:43.200
weird and I mean this is weird for Nintendo because Nintendo usually

50:43.200 --> 50:48.120
releases their stuffs on their games on Sundays they're switching to Tuesdays

50:48.120 --> 50:51.640
now so they're finally getting normal like everybody else

50:51.640 --> 50:57.240
yes I guess good for them well you know switching over to the Xbox 360 for a

50:57.240 --> 50:59.760
minute it's been speculated for a while that one of the things that they are

50:59.760 --> 51:02.920
going to announce at e3 along with all that you know news that got leaked last

51:02.920 --> 51:09.800
month or knows about two weeks ago was the price drop the Xbox 360 you know any

51:09.800 --> 51:13.480
day now should be getting some type of price drop and it looks like it might

51:13.480 --> 51:17.720
happen at e3 that they might walk out there on stage and they're gonna say we

51:17.720 --> 51:21.660
are dropping the price of the Xbox 360 here's what happened to make us all

51:21.660 --> 51:27.320
think that is that apparently a Kmart ad has leaked it's a Kmart ad that is

51:27.320 --> 51:34.000
actually supposed to hit on July 6th and this ad shows that there is an Xbox 360

51:34.000 --> 51:39.320
20 gig console meaning it comes with the hard drive to $99.99 is being advertised

51:39.320 --> 51:43.560
as a new low price also supporting the fact that this ad is for the week of

51:43.560 --> 51:47.560
July 6th you see a little box art for civilization revolution as a game that's

51:47.560 --> 51:51.080
coming out that week that is a game that's scheduled to be out that week so

51:51.080 --> 51:55.600
very interesting that this could be seeing a $50 price drop from the current

51:55.600 --> 52:01.240
$349 that folks are paying for this system we don't know if it's arcade or

52:01.240 --> 52:04.600
something new it could be a new skill if I remember correctly though it's not

52:04.600 --> 52:09.680
actually the six it's for the 13th is when this at all oh yeah there's a

52:09.680 --> 52:14.080
higher-res scan of this ad near the very bottom it says like oh seven one three

52:14.080 --> 52:18.280
is the like ad cereal or whatever on the bottom there but did nobody shops at K

52:18.280 --> 52:23.720
Mart I think I understand that but if this is true then you know people are

52:23.720 --> 52:28.040
gonna price match and what have you you know I it's it's not they're not gonna

52:28.040 --> 52:32.040
all of a sudden drop their systems down for you know whatever it says new low

52:32.040 --> 52:38.020
price not saying you know on sale SSJ 100 Matt says Rob do we get a rock us to

52:38.020 --> 52:44.120
caucus t-shirt with our purchase of 360 a part that possibly you know what I

52:44.120 --> 52:48.440
want one of those shirts who knows you might be able to buy some mole if you

52:48.440 --> 52:53.560
want to mold the Xbox 360 that's the thing if Kmart ends up selling these I

52:53.560 --> 52:57.200
it's got it better be for an old skewer house Kmart gonna get rid of all the

52:57.200 --> 53:01.120
360s have been sitting on their shelves since launch because nobody shops at K

53:01.120 --> 53:05.240
Mart I didn't get a price matched all right it doesn't matter they get all

53:05.240 --> 53:08.780
that stuff in the back I was gonna say about that whole July 16 the early rumor

53:08.780 --> 53:12.760
said that that was the date but you're right e3 is actually the week is 4th of

53:12.760 --> 53:16.280
July weekend hello they're not gonna do e3 then e3 is the week after so yeah

53:16.280 --> 53:19.360
would make more sense if that was the July 13th yeah but even then Civ

53:19.360 --> 53:22.080
Revolution is probably the only big title I can think big big title on the

53:22.080 --> 53:25.320
Xbox 360 I'm thinking of in the next couple weeks yeah like this Don King

53:25.320 --> 53:28.680
price fighter if you look you know and I don't even know why I looked at this

53:28.680 --> 53:33.360
one I I was looking at this ad here they have a high res scan on joystick if you

53:33.360 --> 53:40.120
look at the very bottom left-hand corner it says job number 713 so that's when

53:40.120 --> 53:44.120
the ad is supposed to hit I have a feeling somebody else another retailer

53:44.120 --> 53:47.520
will leak a very similar thing this week and that's when you know it's the real

53:47.520 --> 53:51.600
deal I already I'm already on board saying it's the real deal I think I mean

53:51.600 --> 53:56.020
look it was it last year with the whole I think the first price drop and also

53:56.020 --> 54:00.420
there was the PlayStation 3 stuff too I think that there was some sort of price

54:00.420 --> 54:04.920
drop or skew announcement or something like that right by that right so I think

54:04.920 --> 54:09.000
it was the 80 gig or something well there you have it a price drop coming

54:09.000 --> 54:12.540
soon so if you haven't bought an Xbox 360 yet and you want to and I say this

54:12.540 --> 54:15.300
because we've had some mailbag people write us recently wondering if they

54:15.300 --> 54:18.960
should take the plunge and get one out maybe you should wait now a couple weeks

54:18.960 --> 54:23.880
before this price drop unless you go to a store that's going to honor because

54:23.880 --> 54:27.760
sometimes stores like at the price changes within a month they will give

54:27.760 --> 54:32.120
you a refund I would rather try not risk it and just you know buy it just wait a

54:32.120 --> 54:36.720
few more weeks just wait a couple more weeks and I think you will be good so

54:36.720 --> 54:41.800
and then you might have a reason to shop at Kmart a reason to shop it came pick

54:41.800 --> 54:45.700
up some of that hip 80s fashion while you're there I have bought something at

54:45.700 --> 54:49.840
Kmart would you buy I bought something at Kmart once in the past three years

54:49.840 --> 54:53.240
and that's because they were the only place open on Thanksgiving I bought

54:53.240 --> 54:58.360
cereal there why did you have to get cereal at Kmart it was the Kmart's right

54:58.360 --> 55:03.640
around the corner from my house and they actually had cranberry remember they had

55:03.640 --> 55:07.280
the diet cranberries here I missed all right like a month after it had been

55:07.280 --> 55:12.440
discontinued I think you can still get crystal Pepsi at Kmart actually really

55:12.440 --> 55:18.440
okay no I'm like funny story last night for no apparent reason we were just

55:18.440 --> 55:24.520
coming back from dropping off my sister from we went and saw Wally so Nellie was

55:24.520 --> 55:28.720
a little bit hungry and so we decided to go to the 24-hour Walmart and you know

55:28.720 --> 55:33.920
we went in there buying okay we only need aluminum foil and like you know a

55:33.920 --> 55:38.320
snack and then that's it we ended up walking out with like aluminum or not

55:38.320 --> 55:41.880
even aluminum foil because we forgot to get that obviously but we walked out

55:41.880 --> 55:48.120
like bagel bites and like clothes and random shit it's like what the hell

55:48.120 --> 55:52.680
what is wrong with this I did buy something important there what I bought

55:52.680 --> 55:57.680
flannel sheets for my massage class I Kmart yeah cuz it was convenient see for

55:57.680 --> 56:04.240
me have the Martha Stewart sheets there though did you know that Wow Wow I

56:04.240 --> 56:08.240
almost live literally next door to a freaking Walmart and I don't go there

56:08.240 --> 56:14.520
unless I have to because it's scary yes did you see this oh right over there by

56:14.520 --> 56:18.440
the freeway they are opening up a Hooters right by my house go do we

56:18.440 --> 56:26.400
should do our olr 300 episode live at Hooters I'm serious well we'll have to

56:26.400 --> 56:29.200
look into it if they're not eating hot wings cuz our hot wings tastes like shit

56:29.200 --> 56:32.520
we'll have to see if they have the facilities for that and if they're not

56:32.520 --> 56:35.560
gonna charge us too much but otherwise I kind of like that idea of doing our

56:35.560 --> 56:43.700
300th episode live for mooders we'll have to see pk jr. 92 asks how is it

56:43.700 --> 56:49.100
scary Rob the Walmart over here just it's it's there's always like people

56:49.100 --> 56:53.900
outside asking for money and you know and when you walk in there it smells

56:53.900 --> 56:58.400
like formaldehyde I have a good way to describe it what think of the oldest

56:58.400 --> 57:05.600
Walmart in this in the south and then transpose it to California not quite as

57:05.600 --> 57:13.280
bad the floors are at least white but the quality of consumer sadly I think

57:13.280 --> 57:16.480
the Kmart locally here is a little bit more ahead of the times in the Walmart

57:16.480 --> 57:21.040
next really really the only difference between Walmart's and Kmart's is Kmart

57:21.040 --> 57:24.840
you have to step on the pad to open the door instead of you know the infrared

57:24.840 --> 57:32.440
all right enough Kmart chat back to gaming news we gotta we gotta we have

57:32.440 --> 57:40.840
Tommy is waiting to come on our show we gotta get to him okay well hey we've got

57:40.840 --> 57:46.440
some other stuff that's that's a pretty crap news for our friends in the UK

57:46.440 --> 57:53.600
they're supposed to introduce a dual rating system for rating games one

57:53.600 --> 57:59.120
that's the if I'm right it's the PEG I and the other one then to go with the

57:59.120 --> 58:07.480
BBFC and anyway they were talking about the games that were rated 12 plus or

58:07.480 --> 58:12.160
above by the PEG I should also be rated by the BBFC the British Board of Film

58:12.160 --> 58:17.520
Classification to also include you know that which right now they only rate the

58:17.520 --> 58:25.480
the 15 and 18 but there's but Microsoft is actually saying that it's going to

58:25.480 --> 58:29.960
make the games more expensive because they have to submit them through both

58:29.960 --> 58:36.600
rating systems as well as delay their releases because they have to be

58:36.600 --> 58:42.720
approved by both so in fact it's a pretty much quote this it was actually

58:42.720 --> 58:50.880
said by Neil Thompson who was one of the executives there that quote we're

58:50.880 --> 58:54.320
concerned with any measures that would mean this process is made more unwieldy

58:54.320 --> 59:05.600
or incurs additional costs which have to be shared with the consumer so so that's

59:05.600 --> 59:10.880
kind of crap don't you think yeah kind of sucks that they have to do too I mean

59:10.880 --> 59:14.560
I understand why you just can't stick with one rating system I know right it's

59:14.560 --> 59:20.080
basically like well we need to rate it too well no then just have them rate

59:20.080 --> 59:26.720
everything you're the Peggy system I don't see why we can't do this in

59:26.720 --> 59:29.560
America and why they can't do it everywhere else at whatever wherever has

59:29.560 --> 59:34.560
a movie rating system apply it to the games or just yeah have an equivalent

59:34.560 --> 59:40.000
well we don't need an ESRB if people can understand what movie ratings are about

59:40.000 --> 59:46.360
then apply it to video games as well yeah so stupid I know but people are

59:46.360 --> 59:54.200
even dumber than that so they won't understand oh well so yet another

59:54.200 --> 01:00:00.920
Microsoft rumor we've got here and it's kind of interesting but then again the

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:07.480
source is not entirely credible so take this with a huge grain of salt anyways

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.960
this was apparently found from the 4chan forums which I know that probably

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.600
already wow that's the most respectable news source I've ever I know I know I

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.240
know but just just reporting it that's all there are two screenshots that

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.480
supposedly leaked from 4chan yeah I know it's weird

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:35.200
dubbed my gamer pad and it's basically kind of like Microsoft's version of home

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.200
it looks like you know they've got the avatars this one screenshot shows they

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:49.280
can invite friends you know change your wardrobe of furnishings etc and then you

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.400
know the logo for it looks like it's drawing like crayon I don't know so big

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.240
grain of salt definitely big grain of salt that but I don't think there's

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:06.120
really excuse me I don't think there's really an excuse me I'm choking go ahead

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:12.520
yeah so who knows I mean it it could be very well photoshopped but you know with

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.320
these kind of announcements that you would be been hearing and leaks and

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.240
stuff about you know their avatar system and stuff like that I could definitely

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.500
see them doing something like this you know I think in the minute you said I'm

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.440
trying to get the nicest way to say this but I can't really like think of

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:31.040
anything with a minute you said this news comes to us from the 4chan forums

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.700
like the biggest grain of salt fell from the head like the entire salt lake

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:45.200
dumped here in studio when he said that yeah I when I think news I think CNN and

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:54.680
MSNBC I don't think fortune well okay just saying in case it actually becomes

01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:02.360
true yeah exactly I love this comment from j-rod and chat 4chan Photoshop

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:13.480
never I know I know but just saying you know just in case it's true you heard it

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:22.760
here first you heard it's not true you heard it on the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:31.080
getting Bobby commercial for us heart heart heart heart alright anyhow it's

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:38.560
time for us to do something here on olr we haven't done in a while that's dance

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.840
no we have a stupid award giveaway tonight and tonight it's not because of

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.600
any of the hideous shooting or anything thankfully but this is just no plain

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.920
stupidity the news comes to us from the New Haven Advocate and it is about the

01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:01.000
Connecticut State Senator Gail Slosburg Gail Slosburg is looking for the rape

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
scene in Grand Theft Auto form and going to the actual news article here on New

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.360
Haven advocate.com she wants confirmation of the rumored rape scene

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.840
in Grand Theft Auto for she is unable though to reach that level of the game

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:22.440
could it possibly be because I don't know it doesn't exist but she's she's

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:28.680
not willing to believe that but she just doesn't believe it surely this is a

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:34.240
grant that surely there must be rape I'm basically she was that she was putting

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.760
out a request that someone proved to her that's not in there well that that's

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:48.520
often logic is that if you're innocent prove that there is no rape in your game

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:59.640
need I say more you're an idiot this is why politicians suck not all but most

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.440
like this one they suck once they get to a certain level yeah let us know when

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.040
you find that scene you know but the funny thing is is that she's going to be

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.840
going around forever and ever trying to find that scene and she never will so

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:18.080
heaven forbid she actually gets some work done oh speaking of Grand Theft Auto

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:23.920
for though I did see the most hilarious thing in that the lab dances what

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:30.600
they're hilarious so badly animated I was gonna say she's gonna find the lost

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.160
city of gold before she finds that rape scene in there maybe she can find a

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.240
balanced budget for the state of Connecticut I don't know I don't know if

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.480
they have the budget problems we do in California but if this were coming from

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.880
a California senator I would be going through the freaking roof because they

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.200
cannot balance a fucking budget in this state I would be I would be in the

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.120
middle of the roof right now it's in Connecticut do you really need to lower

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:56.200
yourself to Delaware's level I mean seriously all right you know what news

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:01.520
like this makes us a you know what fuck it it's the F use of the week

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.840
if you to me for using the wrong music tonight oh well bit of retroness for you

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:18.580
guys Jamie if you love um I have a few so I'll try to get through them as

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:27.840
quickly as possible if you to me for being so out of it that I made an error

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:37.960
in the email I won't elaborate more also if you to my body because I got really

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.920
sick on Thursday night well technically Friday morning with some pretty nasty

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.920
pain in my stomach I mean really bad and I'm not gonna go into details because it

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:55.480
was fairly disgusting but I ended up going into the doctor on Friday and

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:02.320
tested for a heptic ulcer and a few other stomach related problems and got

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.920
put on quite a number of drugs to help with digestive issues so and one of them

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:14.760
is addictive fun yeah I know I have to be very careful but and then I'm also

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.600
being treated for a sinus infection because we've had smoke all right pretty

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.120
bad awful smoke from the fire was it up in Placer County the fires are like all

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.160
over its surrounding fire there's fires up in the mountains Torino there's fires

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.560
up in the mountains to the bay there's fires up north and Chico I think there's

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.980
there's no fires in south and it's the only safe place head south we haven't

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:42.760
had any blue skies in a while we've had sort of a dusty brown color true story

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.200
if you go on to the Wii forecast channel at least yesterday it actually said haze

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.040
and it showed that disgusting brown colored cloud for our weather and that's

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.080
the first time I'd ever seen that in this area it was just nasty but the

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.080
thing is is that basically we've all been you know inhaling you know very

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.920
fine soot you know in our air and I'm not the only one a lot of people have

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.080
developed sinus infections just from the damage you know caused from inhaling

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:18.080
this day in and day out so if you do the fires even though I normally like fire

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.240
if you two fires on that scale Wow frisbee inactivated or active activated

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.400
in our Justin TV chat the weather function because you can type weather

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.840
and where we're at and the official weather on Justin TV says it's currently

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:37.320
83 degrees Fahrenheit conditions smoke yeah that's and today's actually a lot

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.640
prettier than it has been yes it today is a lot nicer but on top of that though

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.560
we've had some we've had cooler weather because of the phase however though at

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.520
the hottest part of the day it has trapped plenty of so and our hottest

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.360
part of the day is like was it three four o'clock about four yeah right when

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:03.400
the show starts about five so it's been on the not fun level and people have

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.760
been getting sick from it so big f you goes to the the fires and good luck to

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.360
the people who actually live in those areas yeah definitely I used to live up

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.040
in Chico where a lot of those fires are happening in that area and I know

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.920
friends of friends that have been affected and it just sucks there's no

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.800
there's no real other way to put it sucks I remember going to Julian which

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.520
is right outside San Diego up in the mountains after they had the big bad you

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.440
know but forest fires they are the mountains and seeing what happened to

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.560
one of the mountain towns it was just gone see foundations traffic whole place

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.600
is gone so so having seen you know what happens right after the fire just hope

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.880
that everyone comes to it okay all right well that is it for your refuse we'll go

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.560

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.200
fireworks immediately sets off forest fires you know because they're like

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:38.880

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.800
two favorite songs in in the groove actually there would be three because I

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.080
kind of like lemmings on the run and then outside of that I like the bonsai

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.000
songs I like zodiac and I like and Anubis that's it I like the gypsy with

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:11.760

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:19.640
really it well next email dun dun dun hey olr been listening for two years now

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.720
big fan listening to episode 284 part a y'all are talking about Gradius five I

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.040
got a suggestion for an old updated shooter 19xx insert subtitle here put

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.280
out by Capcom its sequel to 1942 and 1943 and this time with weapon powerups

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.040
akin to what you'd see in space shooters and then addressed to me a classic game

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.720
of the week it's from Richard and I love the 19xx series and I would love to see

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.400
an updated one seriously that would be so sweet am I crazy I thought I saw one

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:55.720
was in planning I don't have a remake of 1942 coming out to Xbox Live Arcade I

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.840
thought I had heard something about one of the 19 something-something games

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.480
being remade or something was happening so you might get your wish sooner sooner

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:09.400
than you thought and next step and this comes from I'm just going to say from

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:15.040
Peter would a takeover by EA of take to be good for the gaming industry

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.160
consider 2k sports and the GTA franchise a lot is at stake I personally prefer a

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:28.120
takeover then for EA to spin off rockstar I like this you know even though

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.240
I'm not much of a sports game player I don't think it's a good idea to have 2k

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.720
sports in EA your two biggest sports game makers in the same roof I just

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.960
think that's kind of a bad idea that monopolize the market yeah you know as

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.800
far as the rest of it goes you know I don't know enough about the inner

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.120
workings of the game industry and how you know how much freedom the current

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.200
teams would have to continue to develop their products if this happened but that

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.560
would be my number one concern would be the monopoly of the sports games and

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.640
that there's really no one else who is wanting to step up and challenge that

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.440
monopoly of course the fact that EA holds that whole exclusive license thing

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:08.880
doesn't help and next up and this comes from Ben I um I cannot believe that you

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.880
guys didn't jump on this show to 84 6 year anniversary show at 1 hour 7

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:20.600
minutes and 40 second mark guitar hero tool comic freakin gold no one jumped on

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.600

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.560
was Andrew that said it I thought was someone in chat that had said it but

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:39.240
okay I just said tool would be cool but but I think the joke there is that

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:42.280
you're kind of a tool if you keep buying all these guitar hero games ha ha ha

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.480

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:56.080
tool addition because I like tool so um wow we did get a couple of different

good weekend Oh Lord smash brothers out is out in the UK why has it taken so

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.040
long to come out here we always get screwed over with releases what the fuck

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.400
Nintendo seriously you need to pull your thumb out of your arse and get some

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.280
decent games out soon I recently completed Metroid on the Wii and I do

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.520
believe it was a superb game however I can't help but think that there were

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.160
some areas that could have been improved so easily it could have been incredible

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.440
the story and writing could have been more immersive and compelling let's face

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.920
it you didn't really care about why you were shooting at this spiky space a

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.680
space pirates you just wanted to get to the next pretty stage with a new and

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:52.680
bigger gun the cutscenes in this and the sorry the cutscenes in this day and age

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.680
were pretty poor don't tell me it's because the Wii is underpowered the ps2

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.320
could pull off cinematic and exciting cutscenes for God's sake take a look at

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:07.640
eternal darkness retro one last thing I love being in Samus' ship it was so I'm

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.280
getting tongue-tied again it was so cool pressing all of those buttons now did I

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.580
miss something or does the best button do nothing at all you know which one I

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:19.880
mean the one that makes the big gun appear it could have been a fantastic

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.880
bonus to fly off into space and shoot baddies from this fresh perspective okay

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.920
bitching over you don't have to read this out as I know you hate long emails

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.300
and I don't hate long emails and may have nominated myself for an FQ of the

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:35.760
week oh shit I just realized that I'm making it longer oh should I did it

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.320
again oh fuck a ball shit fuck ours you're just trying to get me to say that

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.000
that was funny it worked see you later this email brought to you by chart and

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.680
is never-ending wait for some kind of goddamn RTS command and conquer game for

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:59.280
the Wii nice that was funny email quite next up done done done hi everyone hi

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:08.720
hi um I have a few questions for the three of you one no 42 all right go

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:15.000
ahead the answer is 42 go ahead have you ever had what could be termed as a holy

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.080
crap moments as they relate to gaming an example may be like when you seen your

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:23.700
first video game or arcade as a youngster or maybe he's youngster that's

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:28.520
cute or maybe seen a game that was light years ahead of its contemporaries in

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.760
some regards Final Fantasy 7 anyone furthermore how heavily do these holy

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.480
crap moments factor into your decision to stay with gaming if you want a recent

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.000
example play Lost Odyssey and the first time one of those text-only stories

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.040
comes up on the screen the memories that was kind of one of those holy crap type

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.720
moments and I think it was exactly like the way I said it too so there you have

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.240
it as far as what was the second half of the question how does it play in the

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:59.100
year and your decision to stick with gaming um you know just like I like to

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.440
say holy crap at movies but sometimes I like to laugh at movies sometimes I like

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.800
to cry at movies not that I really cry at video games but you know I just I

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.160
like to have fun so it doesn't necessarily have to be a holy crap

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:15.940
moment but they help I think that my last holy crap moment I remember when my

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:21.440
early holy crap moments was when you're doing the the train cart ride in a Final

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.880
Fantasy 6 and I was like oh my god it's like Indiana Jones I've got a headache

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.220
nice but you know I every so often I run into a game that gives me those happy

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:38.440
moments like that so I think I keep playing to you know find more of those

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.520
happy times I thought of one other one how about symphony of the night when you

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.320
get the real ending quote-unquote and then you go into the upside-down castle

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.200
and you realize you have to play the whole fucking game all over again it's

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.000
hard with a whole new oh yeah I was kind of one of those oh my god or how long it

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.480
took me to freaking get a jewel sword that sucked no I'll tell you what what

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.680
took even longer was getting the freaking Yotatsuna having to fight the

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.000
the werewolf that was a pain in the butt anyway and number two a few episodes

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.200
back Rob mentioned that he was interested in the HD remake of commando

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.280
3 for the 360 I'm interested in his opinion on it assuming that he's played

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:22.000
it I haven't sorry it's on my to-do list naughty me well number three then have

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.340
the three of you considered making up some goofy as all hell sounding catch

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:30.520
phrases or words to use on air I found that using such things can be quite fun

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.660
my personal favorite is snot puppy don't ask I don't know what it means either I

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:38.040
made it up a few years ago after having way too much crown royal and lab at blue

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:44.640
I like twat waffle myself but I I didn't I didn't make that up so I can't really

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.900
claim that I I made that up but I like twat waffle but you know what those

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:54.440
types of things you can't force like you can't make fetch happen stop trying to

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:59.000
make fetch happen those types of things have to have to happen naturally next

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.880
you twat waffle for do you know of any places where I can buy video game

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.080
soundtracks preferably on CD and of sites where I can get them with less

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.480
than honest you know give them less than honestly but I want to support video

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.560
game music with my hard-earned money Kinokuniya

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:21.200
import Japan import soundtracks play Asia carries a lot of fun yeah Amazon it

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.720
has a lot of that stuff they've got everything and actually they're really

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.160
seeing legitimate ones in the u.s. plenty of times now if you don't prefer

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.160
shopping online you like to walk into a store and look at the real thing try

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.720
like comic book stores locally because I know one of the ones here has them so it

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.520
depends where this guy lives try like comic book stores and other nerdy type

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.200
stores you never know that it might be a small selection but they'll probably

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.680
have it like the local comic book store here has the Final Fantasies the DDR so

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:55.800
you know the big stuff so all right um last question I'm on a similar note once

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.840
I move I'll be considering buying one two two three arcade machines I've never

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.160
uh-huh never bought any before in my life with that being said what advice

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.380
those pointers can you give me if it helps at all all the games I'll

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.280
considered were made between 1978 1998 and spin across virtually every genre

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.640
I'll tell you probably the best thing you're gonna be able to do for your

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:21.040
money is to get an ego AVS machine get a multi-cart one you can either get them

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.920
in you can get them in one two four or six sixes are hard to find but fours are

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.240
still kind of easy and the the cartridges are not that expensive and

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:36.360
then on top of that you can just buy new AVS cartridges and switch them out so

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.880
once in a while you see those ultra Kate ish things pop up like I remember

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.760
Target was running around one like two Christmases ago and I think Costco once

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.640
in a while has one too you have to really keep your eye out for them they

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.560
usually show up around the holidays but you know another multi-game in one

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.440
system and very very classic stuff you know we built a main cabinet out of a

01:21:54.440 --> 01:22:00.600
pole position stand up nice so you could do that too maim is fun sorry for the

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.400
summit lengthy email and thank you for taking the time to read it as well as

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.060
answer my questions you're welcome that'll be a dollar last email all right

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.160
this is the long one oh my gosh I thought that was long all right all

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:19.160
right last one hello and good show to everyone this is it's Rini right I think

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:24.120
so yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay a very long time since I've written in to

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.160
begin I'd like to touch on knuckles chaotic says featured on dark sacros

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.640
classic game of the week from a couple episodes ago a correction the games were

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.040
not the characters were not rendered in 3d they were sprite based what was in

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:38.200
3d were the special stages I'm sorry they looked rendered an interesting note

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.680
on said special stages you can complete them all to get an obligatory set of

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.080
jewels that need to be acquired however as an extra challenge players could

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.280
compete in special stages again only this time the stages were drawn in wire

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.640
frames to make it even more devious the wire frame versions you only had

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.080
flickering verticals of the polygons to go by to avoid the holes as best as

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.280
possible a dark soccer also touched on sonic crackers the presumed prototype

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.600
for chaotic not necessarily a tip but for anyone who's played the old side

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.400
schooling sonic games should go online and read up on the analyses for earlier

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.360
ROM dumps that were meant for developers eyes interesting bits include tiny

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.240
nuances such as the pixel perfect placement of the score ring and life

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.880
indicators on screen to the creepy sounding genocide city zone an

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.040
alternative stage that was supposed to be a meltdown version of the chemical

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.840
plant zone and sonic to the players would reach later in the game it's a

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.920
nice way to kill an afternoon I love prototypes though I love looking for

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.920
prototype games I actually have a couple of prototypes that were released for

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:49.400
Atari 5200 like millipede hot I know it is hot and this pac-man for the other

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.160
half of this email that's not quite half it's more like a third I listened to

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.080
your anniversary shows ask orange knowledge radio segment and Bobby black

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:00.920
wolf asked how Konami could improve the American Bemani situation very briefly

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:06.440
was pop and music mentioned as to how it could be brought over which should this

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.240
is the obvious issue of localizing it but there's another problem content

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.200
correct me if I'm wrong but poppin has a lot of songs unfit for the u.s. I was

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.240
mulling over this for a while and thought of a different a different way

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:20.880
to approach this issue since poppin is not the typical instrument oriented game

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.780
why make it themed in a certain manner like it is in Japan since the Japanese

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:28.320
song list has songs relevant to Japan and its culture why not do something

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.080
different for the u.s. agreed absolutely agree they don't have to just copy the

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.320
same damn game agree if you want my take on this Konami should have a video game

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:43.080
theme song list an optimal situation the u.s. song list would consist of part chaos

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.160
part licenses and part songs from video games not just Konami either here's why

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:52.760
in my personal preference we should get a poppin we and take Smash Brothers brawl

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.560
approach because the Wii is selling downloads etc and imagine Konami being

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.080
able not only to access music from every Nintendo console release but also from

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.880
any console services on the virtual console aka anything before ps1 and any

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.520
sort of relevance although technically you can have access to an entirety of

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:16.800
Sega's offerings to imagine playing the the goddamn hardcore remix of gourmet

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:23.240
race from Kirby superstars that's on brawl on poppin it says holy shit shut

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:29.000
up sexy ferret OMG I'm seriously imagine Konami having access to those vast

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
assets and putting select songs in the pop and earlier in their original chip

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.680
tune form or gloriously remixed from modernization they hadn't on a mail

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:41.200
version though can I jump in here and say my suggestion here I think he's on

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.600
a good track here because I don't think you can make an entire game out of video

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.720
game nostalgia though and expect it to be totally successful I think a little

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.160
of that is good and a little bit of the Japanese stuff would be good as well to

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.600
throw a bone to the old poppin fans but here's the way you want to make pop and

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.360
music successful here it is I'll give you a big hint it's in the name of the

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:10.400
game pop in music pop music what we have guitar hero rock music we have DDR dance

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.480
music but we don't have anything that's a lot of like poppy music I'm not

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.640
talking about necessarily Britney Spears and all that although that might be you

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.560
know inevitable but what about stuff that's like you know 80s pop and 90s pop

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.600
like could you imagine a game made of all like pop music tunes from the 90s

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.560
you play on this I think that's where I think this series should go but I think

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.640
there should be some of the retro video game I just think contract wise and all

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.200
that stuff probably couldn't happen maybe a little bit the last third of the

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.920
email oh is it truly wishful thinking but I strongly believe in this approach

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.720
because if you think about it this would be practically resembling a tribute or

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.600
acknowledgement of sorts to video games themselves and there aren't really many

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.080
games if at all that do this oh and it'd be double as filler for Japanese

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.760
releases but no one cares for that this email has run too long so I'd like to

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.920
give a chance for another listener to give their input before I finish I would

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:08.760
like to chastise the olr host minkletov and the andrew junami that zephyr is

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.320
that how it's pronounced yes ever for the listless selections for the best

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.880
man money songs on the sixth anniversary show how could you neglect scorpion fire

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.640
from 2dx read and I'm talking about the epic eight minute long version one two

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.880
you're you're all mean but points to look you for canceling out Zephyr this

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.280
message is brought to you by the metallic rose DS light because baiting

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.920
and switching target for your coral pink light with four metallic rose just feels

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:40.080
right yes I really did do this shame on you but that's funny I was done email

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.360
epic email is very epic all right let's get back to the news we still got it we

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:51.000
still got Tommy and please now let's get let's get to it awesome so there are

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.320
some interesting patents filed by Sony here in fact people are speculating it's

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.520
for the next PSP or whatever system they're going to be calling it anyways

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:10.640
the grant was or the patent was granted for a handheld device with touchscreen

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:18.360
and digital tactile pixels so it's kind of interesting and I have no idea what

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:25.960
they claim a digital tactile pixels are it says as for a digital tactile pixels

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:31.000
claims 19 through 30 of the patent suggests that a vibration acts as a

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.560
tactile response so what a PSP with a touchscreen so well like you touch it

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.080
and it would vibrate or something interesting tickling game hey might be

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:49.840
fun well who knows what that's gonna be but something in the works which is not

01:28:49.840 --> 01:29:00.120
surprising very interesting apparently and I'm apologize because this link here

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.960
in our role is broken hopefully maybe look you can help me out a little bit

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.480
here Kingdom Hearts 3 apparently was rumored to be in the next Nintendo power

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.640
what is up with that well we already talked about that actually in March 3

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.040
we talked about some of the other stuff that Nintendo Power League but

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.760
apparently they're saying something about Kingdom Hearts 3 no it was a thing

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.160
that was rumored there was a sword in the new member Jamie talked about it

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.200
actually oh really yeah oh so I don't know happen there but basically there's

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:34.400
a sword little image thing of a sword and people are saying because it said

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.320
that if you read the quote on there it said they're teasing what it was there

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:44.360
oh it's news fit for a king has a lot of heart it's probably mother 3 just

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:51.960
kidding hmm you know King heart 3 I get it oh I see because that happens in the

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:56.760
comments to this little news story here well who knows but I don't think I know

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.600
they've already got two Kingdom Hearts games in the pipeline that aren't even

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:05.280
out yet so and you're full of crap that's it I'm full of crap no not you

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:10.720
people who are trying to say Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out on the Wii I

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:16.560
totally doubt that well we'll see you next month yeah it's true there is some

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:24.240
news regarding a crave and the ESA as in crave said a bye to the ESA which is the

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:29.280
Entertainment Software Association they actually send a report into they

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.560
actually confirmed sorry a report on game politics that crave entertainment

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.520
was basically splitting that they had decided not to renew their membership

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.440
and they're off to I guess do their own thing you know the other departures that

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:50.640
left were the Vendee Activision LucasArts a bunch of other things you're

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.020
talking about previously but the you know interesting that one more is now

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:58.800
join them but then again I try to think what is crave done lately nothing I can

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:06.800
think of World Championship poker yippee yeah so I guess this isn't exactly it's

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.080
not nearly as big as Activision Vendee not going but it is interesting that the

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:18.480
Exodus continues nonetheless yeah well one thing that's been gone for a while

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:25.160
that's actually just come back is Nestor yes Nestor from Nintendo Power you

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:31.360
remember Nestor and Howard or Howard Nestor I guess and their exploits and

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.560
you know chronicled in Nintendo Power well now after a you know hiatus of

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:44.720
quite a long time he's back and grown up and it's interesting because now he's I

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:50.760
don't know losing that Mario Kart apparently from the picture too bad

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.920
Howard won't come back but I hear he works somewhere else now so I don't

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:58.160
think that's possible but interesting that those retro comics are making a

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.040
comeback speaking of retro we're about to the end of part a here and this is

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.920
the part of the show where we like to pay respect to our elders and this is

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.160
where dark soccer is gonna go through her gaming closet and dust some things

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:14.720
off and come up with a classic video game of the week for you all it's our

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.440
classic video game of the week what should the kids be playing this week

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:24.840
dark soccer the game you know I'm I told everyone I'm gonna give everybody a hard

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.120
time because they kept bragging on me for Saturn games and for Sega love so I

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:38.600
picked a Sega Saturn game awesome I picked a stall which is known as it is

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:47.480
awesome I know it's um kisui showed and said to us that is the game of the

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:52.320
Japanese shit is what it is it's a 2d side scroller and listen to this music

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.000
isn't pretty

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:09.680
this is one of those gorgeous fairly early in the Saturn's life and it's I

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:14.280
mean it really is just a beautiful game that really shows just the amazing 2d

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.800
capabilities of the Saturn had is the place I'm sorry the PlayStation would

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.720
not have been able to make this game look this gorgeous I'm sorry it had the

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:30.560
2d capability of a snotty nose or something I don't know but it had all of

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:36.900
these just beautiful massive levels and you just had to go through the levels

01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.020
and you had your boss bites I mean it is a it is a platformer but it had some

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:48.840
pretty cool unique elements basically as you go through the game you actually get

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:59.120
a little partner that that comes with you called a Lita that you'd be able to

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.840
basically send your little friend around like a pinball across the screen you

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.880
know bumping back and forth and smacking stuff and grabbing items and killing

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.000
enemies and you also can use it in a co-op mode like you had a second player

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.080
sort of like how you can use tails in a sonic 2 but you could also you know

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.200
punch things and jump things and you could you know stun your enemies by

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.640
punching them and you can throw objects and lift humongous things and you also

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.240
have this sort of super breath attack that you would inhale and then just blow

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:39.360
it all out and blow all the enemies away and it's it's just a really really

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:47.200
really cool game so all right there you have it also just to just to mention if

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:51.200
anyone read the Sonic the Hedgehog comic books that Archie comics did I still

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:57.320
shows up a whole bunch in the background if you can find a YouTube of there's a

01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:06.720
volcano level it's a fucking awesome this is the first level I don't see it

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:10.760
on here but I just have to dig up the game sometime and play it well there you

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.320
have it folks your classic game of the week a stall on the Sega Saturn pretty

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.600
little platformer there with epic music a lot of folks in Chad had never heard

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.600
of that a lot of people are asking what's this game what's this game

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.500
there's a there's actually another a couple of neat trivia things about it

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:32.080
sure go ahead the US release of the game has that where the the title does not

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:38.260
appear on the side of the case all you get is the Sega Saturn logo and it also

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:45.040
has music hidden in the game which is basically the music from the intro where

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.040
you can just put a CD player and listen to it it has lyrics in the Japanese

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.380
version it's just instrumental in the u.s. one and there's also in the games

01:35:53.380 --> 01:36:03.000
graphic files is a sprite of Mario so there's your trivia all right cool so

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.700
check that out on the Sega Saturn is a pretty easy game to find or kind of hard

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:11.960
at this point hard at this point but if you can find it definitely go for it I

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.920
know there are images of it available all right we're finally gonna take a

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.920
break here we're pretty long this segment here over an hour and a half so

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.560
we're gonna take a break here when we come back more of Orange launch radio

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.680
not a whole lot in our next segment news wise because we're gonna have a nice

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.560
long interview with Tommy Tallarico he's gonna be here to talk about video games

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.640

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:53.480
when we come back with more of Orange launch radio so stay tuned
