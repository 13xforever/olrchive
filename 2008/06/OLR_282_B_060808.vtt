00:00.000 --> 00:05.620
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.620 --> 00:11.620
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:11.620 --> 00:14.980
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:14.980 --> 00:19.460
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.460 --> 00:24.180
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.

00:24.180 --> 00:27.780
It is Sunday, June 8th, 2008, and if you're thinking to yourself,

00:27.780 --> 00:34.780
that's not what day I'm listening to this on my iPod or my Zune or whatever device you use to listen to the podcast, PSP, whatever.

00:34.780 --> 00:40.500
It's because you're not tuning in live. We tape live on Sunday nights, thanks to our friends at allgames.com.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.720
We tape at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.260
So sometimes he runs long, sometimes he runs short, just depends.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.760
But usually he catches around 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.560
Honestly, if you get here at like 4.45, there's a great block of programming on allgames.com.

00:55.560 --> 01:00.200
It starts off with Kopackins UK Gaming News, moves on into the Bobby Black Wolf show,

01:00.200 --> 01:03.060
and ends with us, your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.360
We're about to get into the gaming news here for part B.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.620
I just wanted to say real quick though, we got some guests coming up later this month.

01:11.620 --> 01:16.940
I'm trying to arrange some interviews. I don't have anything sealed yet, so I'll get back to you guys on that.

01:16.940 --> 01:23.820
But in studio, one of our long-time OLR friends who hasn't been here in a long time is going to be back in two weeks.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.300
Mikolatov will be here visiting in two weeks, so he'll be back on the program.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.300
So we'll have to play High School Musical stuff for him and get him the game.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.340
Maybe he can tell us what happened to Silent Hill Arcade.

01:32.340 --> 01:35.860
He wanted to go to the whole Happening thing that we were going to do.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.780
I think I may postpone it a week so we can include him as well.

01:38.780 --> 01:39.460
As well.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.340
So, you know.

01:41.340 --> 01:46.300
Because the Happening, I think it's going to suck, but it'll be like a lady in the water.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.740
We can either go all enjoy it or all make fun of it.

01:48.740 --> 01:51.060
Well, since the chatters have no idea what you're talking about,

01:51.060 --> 01:53.940
you're trying to organize people to go see M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, right?

01:53.940 --> 01:54.440
Yes.

01:54.440 --> 01:54.940
I want to see it.

01:54.940 --> 01:55.440
This is the Happening.

01:55.440 --> 01:55.940
Yeah.

01:55.940 --> 01:57.940
I haven't seen Lady in the Water.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.940
Well, consider yourself lucky then.

01:59.940 --> 02:03.820
But I liked, I liked The Village a lot.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.940
I liked The Village too and I thought people were really hard on that movie, but honestly.

02:06.940 --> 02:08.220
And I really liked The Sixth Sense.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.780
I loved The Sixth Sense. I even liked Unbreakable, but seriously, Lady in the Water was shit.

02:12.780 --> 02:18.140
My problem with The Village, my problem with The Village though is they show you what the twist is,

02:18.140 --> 02:20.620
and then they're like, oh, pretend you didn't see that.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.620
You know, we're going to do the twist again.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.620
Oh, just kidding.

02:23.620 --> 02:24.620
It's actually what it was before.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.620
Yeah, that's, that's my problem with it.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.620
All right.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.620
So he'll be back.

02:28.620 --> 02:30.620
I don't know if he can tell us anything about the latest and greatest.

02:30.620 --> 02:36.620
It is a video game employer he was working for for a while, but we'll see if we can prod anything out of him.

02:36.620 --> 02:41.620
And also later this month, June 22nd is the, and I guess he'll be here for it.

02:41.620 --> 02:47.620
The Orange Lounge Radio sixth anniversary show will be on June 22nd, which also happens to be around the time of my birthday.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.620
I'm going to a theme park on my birthday.

02:49.620 --> 02:54.620
Myself and the other half are going to Great America.

02:54.620 --> 03:01.620
That'll be fun because he doesn't really go ride roller coasters, but I told him he has to ride everything I want him to, and he'll scream like a girl.

03:01.620 --> 03:02.620
And we'll get you two.

03:02.620 --> 03:07.620
Roller coasters are, I won't say great because I've only ever really been on one.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.620
But the one I've been on is great.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.620
Which one have you been on?

03:11.620 --> 03:12.620
California Screamin'.

03:12.620 --> 03:13.620
Nice.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.620
You were there.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.620
Oh, I forgot that was like the only one.

03:16.620 --> 03:20.620
Some of the ones they have at like Great America are awesome, like Flight Deck, which used to be top gun.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.620
It's still, it'll always be top gun to me.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.620
Awesomesauce.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.620
But keep in mind, the only ones I will go on has me sitting over the rails, are made of metal.

03:28.620 --> 03:29.620
I will not go on a wood roller coaster.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.620
And have no twisties.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.620
Well, I think Flight Deck has twisties.

03:33.620 --> 03:37.620
What's that one huge arcade game that they have there also at Great America?

03:37.620 --> 03:40.620
The one that you actually go into a separate room to play?

03:40.620 --> 03:41.620
Oh.

03:41.620 --> 03:42.620
I don't remember.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.620
That's when those 3D, no that was a 3D ride.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.620
No, it's not a 3D ride.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.620
It's a video game.

03:48.620 --> 03:52.620
Yeah, it like, it would cost you like 3 bucks to play.

03:52.620 --> 03:53.620
I forget what it's called.

03:53.620 --> 03:54.620
It's on Wikipedia.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.620
It might have been since the last time I've been.

03:55.620 --> 03:56.620
I haven't been.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.620
Kadosho says Goose and Maverick?

03:57.620 --> 03:58.620
Oh, no, no.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.620
Sorry, that's a reference to Top Gun.

04:00.620 --> 04:01.620
What the hell am I thinking?

04:01.620 --> 04:02.620
Nice one.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.620
It's something 3.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.620
I don't remember what it's called.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.620
But anyways.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.620
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.620
Enough about our personal lives.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.620
Let's talk gaming.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.620
Yes.

04:10.620 --> 04:20.620
So the sci-fi channel, curator of really crappy sci-fi movies and also a variety of TV shows

04:20.620 --> 04:22.620
and reality shows and whatnot.

04:22.620 --> 04:26.620
They are creating a brand new, kind of a hybrid show.

04:26.620 --> 04:31.620
It's gonna be both a TV show and it's also gonna be an MMO.

04:31.620 --> 04:38.620
And it says apparently the integration with the MMO is gonna affect the stuff that happens

04:38.620 --> 04:39.620
on air.

04:39.620 --> 04:44.620
So, for example, they gave, we can tell players that there'll be an alien invasion at a certain

04:44.620 --> 04:47.620
place in the game at a certain time.

04:47.620 --> 04:52.620
And to be there, all their friends and stuff will be ready at that time.

04:52.620 --> 04:57.620
And it says the outcome depends on them and then the battle will be part of the universe

04:57.620 --> 04:58.620
in the show.

04:58.620 --> 05:04.620
So if they fail and they all die, then that will be reflected on the TV show.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.620
Which I think is pretty cool.

05:06.620 --> 05:14.620
And it says both the show and the series will be set 80 to 100 years in the future and launched

05:14.620 --> 05:18.620
sometime sooner than summer of 2010.

05:18.620 --> 05:23.620
When I read this or hear about it, I can't help but think, how awesome would the Battlestar

05:23.620 --> 05:25.620
Galactica game have been if it was this?

05:25.620 --> 05:26.620
You know what I mean?

05:26.620 --> 05:29.620
Like that Battlestar Galactica thing they put on Xbox was like junk.

05:29.620 --> 05:33.620
But there's a great game somewhere in the Battlestar Galactica universe.

05:33.620 --> 05:37.620
And something like this is like an MMO where what happens in the show happens.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.620
That would be awesome!

05:38.620 --> 05:44.620
I don't want to feel the fanboy flames or anything, but wouldn't this be funny?

05:44.620 --> 05:46.620
Just throwing it out there.

05:46.620 --> 05:52.620
If it was like, say, a relaunch of Firefly or something like that.

05:52.620 --> 05:58.620
You know, and they have this whole universe that takes place at the same time and that

05:58.620 --> 05:59.620
kind of thing.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.620
That would be funny.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.620
That would be kind of cool, but sadly I think the cast is all doing other stuff now.

06:04.620 --> 06:07.620
So I guess it could be like a new generation, but I don't know.

06:07.620 --> 06:11.620
This doesn't seem like something that Josh Whedon would be all over.

06:11.620 --> 06:12.620
But you never know, I guess.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.620
I doubt it.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.620
It'd be probably something original.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.620
Most likely.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.620
Most likely.

06:17.620 --> 06:23.620
Well, something else original and actually spotted in the wild this week.

06:23.620 --> 06:24.620
Duke Nukem Forever.

06:24.620 --> 06:25.620
Yes, it exists.

06:25.620 --> 06:31.620
It's out there, and you can actually see a little peek of it in this very strange place.

06:31.620 --> 06:36.620
You would think if Duke Nukem Forever is going to launch its first footage ever, it's going

06:36.620 --> 06:44.620
to be like a one-up exclusive or a game trailer's hot land or whatever they call it.

06:44.620 --> 06:50.620
But it shows up on the Jace Hall show, which now he used to be the monolith boss, and I

06:50.620 --> 06:53.620
guess he has his own little web show now.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.620
And I guess it's kind of like parody.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.620
It's like video game sitcom.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.620
Like the offices.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.620
It's interesting.

07:00.620 --> 07:05.620
But they kind of joke about Duke Nukem Forever, and it actually is Duke Nukem Forever that

07:05.620 --> 07:07.620
you see in the little show.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.620
It's around like the 4 minute and 15 second mark.

07:09.620 --> 07:17.620
And the most surprising thing about it, it actually looks kind of cool for that 30 seconds.

07:17.620 --> 07:18.620
I don't know if it only gets worse.

07:18.620 --> 07:21.620
Hell of a way to hype something up, you know?

07:21.620 --> 07:29.620
This guy just landed a really great exclusive and a hell of a way to kick off his new show.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.620
I mean, he should be...

07:31.620 --> 07:34.620
I don't know what kind of ties he has to the Duke Nukem folks.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.620
I don't know the relationships all these companies had.

07:36.620 --> 07:40.620
Well, I actually watched the show, and it was pretty funny other than that stuff.

07:40.620 --> 07:44.620
They did some interviews with a guy from Heroes.

07:44.620 --> 07:46.620
He's doing his own movie and stuff.

07:46.620 --> 07:52.620
But what the focus of the show is supposed to be is on the people developing the games

07:52.620 --> 07:54.620
and not necessarily the games themselves.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.620
And celebrities who play games and stuff like that.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.620
So that's their kind of spin on things.

08:00.620 --> 08:03.620
Less about the games, but more about the developers and people behind the stuff.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.620
Is it one of those things...

08:04.620 --> 08:07.620
I didn't watch it, I'll be honest, because I didn't care about Duke Nukem Forever footage

08:07.620 --> 08:09.620
because nothing will match the original to me.

08:09.620 --> 08:16.620
But was it one of those things where it's kind of like self-parody

08:16.620 --> 08:19.620
where you really kind of have to be in the know to understand the jokes?

08:19.620 --> 08:20.620
Or was it really accessible?

08:20.620 --> 08:22.620
I don't think so. It wasn't even really parody.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.620
It was just an interview show.

08:24.620 --> 08:28.620
They just shot it in the same way as you would shoot The Office or something like that.

08:28.620 --> 08:33.620
Lots of cuts, lots of just cutting between perspectives and stuff like that

08:33.620 --> 08:35.620
and just talking to people.

08:35.620 --> 08:40.620
And there was some goofy moments, but it was no different than, say, Air...

08:40.620 --> 08:44.620
Okay, I don't want to compare it to AirTainment Tonight or something like that.

08:44.620 --> 08:49.620
But no different than a news show that you would see on TV when they do their news pieces.

08:49.620 --> 08:52.620
Except a little bit more knowledgeable and less cheesy.

08:52.620 --> 08:55.620
But they still were playing around and stuff.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.620
All right.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.620
Well, you can check that out if you're really eager to see some Duke Nukem Forever footage.

09:01.620 --> 09:04.620
We're going to go over to DarkSakura next for her story.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.620
But first, a follow-up to Part A.

09:06.620 --> 09:10.620
Hippolytus in chat has done some math regarding the Classic Games of the Week and says,

09:10.620 --> 09:17.620
although only 8 of the 31 games are made by Sega, 13 are made for Sega Systems.

09:17.620 --> 09:23.620
Which actually, all things, I would have guessed it was much more.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.620
That's not quite half.

09:25.620 --> 09:28.620
I would have guessed it was half.

09:28.620 --> 09:31.620
You know what? Here's the thing.

09:31.620 --> 09:35.620
Sega was grossly overlooked by a lot of people at the time it came out.

09:35.620 --> 09:37.620
I think a lot of people, if they realized...

09:37.620 --> 09:43.620
If you knew then what you know now about the Dreamcast, I bet you it would have done a lot better.

09:43.620 --> 09:46.620
So it's okay that we highlight a lot of those games.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.620
Because a lot of people didn't give them a first look the first time around.

09:50.620 --> 09:51.620
So, whatever.

09:51.620 --> 09:54.620
That's it. Next week is another Dreamcast game.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.620
Fine.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.620
It's going to be like Power Stone or something.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.620
Dreamcast games until we get to half.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.620
Power Stone was awesome, wasn't it?

10:02.620 --> 10:04.620
Power Stone was kind of awesome. I would approve of that, actually.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.620
And you can use your save files from the Japanese version on the US version.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.620
Alright, well keep it a surprise until next week.

10:10.620 --> 10:11.620
I might do that. I don't know.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.620
Meanwhile, more gaming news, yes?

10:13.620 --> 10:16.620
Call of Duty 4!

10:16.620 --> 10:20.620
Didn't that sound awesome? Anyway...

10:20.620 --> 10:26.620
They're getting a variety pack for free for the PC version that's actually going to be offered

10:26.620 --> 10:30.620
as part of a deal with Nvidia.

10:30.620 --> 10:35.620
And it's coming two months after, of course, everyone got it on Xbox 360.

10:35.620 --> 10:39.620
However, like I said, they don't have to pay for it.

10:39.620 --> 10:44.620
Creek and Chinatown are the highlights.

10:44.620 --> 10:48.620
There are new arenas.

10:48.620 --> 10:52.620
There's supposed to be Kill House and Broadcast.

10:52.620 --> 11:02.620
And another one is Patch 1.6 that fixes a server crash exploit and a bunch of bugs.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.620
So there you go.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.620
Hooray, bug fixes!

11:06.620 --> 11:07.620
Yay!

11:07.620 --> 11:09.620
Bug report!

11:09.620 --> 11:15.620
Speaking of fixes and tweaks, there's going to be some new tweaks in line for Team Fortress 2.

11:15.620 --> 11:20.620
The next class to be upgraded, I guess, would be the Pyro class.

11:20.620 --> 11:28.620
They are giving them a brand new, I believe, an axe, which is going to be kind of neat.

11:28.620 --> 11:34.620
Also, there are rumors that they're going to be introducing a sniper class as well.

11:34.620 --> 11:37.620
So, that's neat.

11:37.620 --> 11:43.620
I like to see games that they kind of tweak them as things come out to improve them and make them a little bit better.

11:43.620 --> 11:49.620
But, unfortunately, I have not jumped on the bandwagon and haven't really played Team Fortress 2.

11:49.620 --> 11:55.620
Just mainly because, you know, I like a little single player in my multiplayer games.

11:55.620 --> 11:57.620
But that's just me.

11:57.620 --> 12:03.620
Anyways, the new weapon, as I was saying, is called the Extinguisher.

12:03.620 --> 12:14.620
And I guess it's a weapon that deals half as much damage as a standard fire axe unless you use it against somebody engulfed in flames.

12:14.620 --> 12:19.620
And it deals, I guess, a critical hit. So, that's kind of neat.

12:19.620 --> 12:25.620
And then, like I said, one of the other things that they're going to be doing, I guess, is Meet the Sniper.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.620
So, that's going to be a new character, hopefully.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.620
Wait, Meet the Sniper?

12:30.620 --> 12:32.620
I was thinking of that movie.

12:32.620 --> 12:33.620
Meet the Parents.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.620
No, no.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.620
Meet the Sniper.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.620
They're doing it.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.620
And maybe the sniper is already in the game.

12:41.620 --> 12:42.620
Maybe I'm just an idiot.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.620
Like I said, I don't play this game.

12:44.620 --> 12:46.620
But they are giving the sniper an intro.

12:46.620 --> 12:51.620
They did little intro videos for all the different classes that are in this game.

12:51.620 --> 12:57.620
So, they have little funny videos that kind of explain what the class involves and that kind of thing.

12:57.620 --> 13:01.620
You're not supposed to meet the sniper. They're just supposed to shoot you in the face when you're not looking.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.620
Well, yes.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.620
You can actually be shot in the face and live.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.620
That is true.

13:07.620 --> 13:12.620
So, a good sniper would aim for the neck or the forehead.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.620
Alright, look.

13:16.620 --> 13:24.620
Well, apparently a druid knew where to aim to kill Onyxia all by his little self.

13:24.620 --> 13:29.620
Actually, it might have been a female druid, actually, that did this.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.620
Let's see.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.620
Yeah, it was a female druid, Cyrenia, that did this.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.620
Was it really a female druid or was it a guy playing a female druid?

13:35.620 --> 13:37.620
Probably a guy playing a female druid, just like I am.

13:37.620 --> 13:40.620
Here's the deal. Onyxia, if you're not in the WoW, no.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.620
Onyxia used to be the boss of one of those 40-man raids.

13:43.620 --> 13:49.620
She was a very, very difficult boss to fight and you had to get 40 people together to kill her.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.620
Well, now, that was in the old WoW, before Burning Crusade.

13:52.620 --> 13:55.620
Well, when Burning Crusade came out, everybody can get 10 levels higher.

13:55.620 --> 13:58.620
And even though the old bosses supposedly got a little harder, I don't know.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.620
I don't do a lot of old game content.

14:00.620 --> 14:04.620
Apparently, it's much easier to get there now, getting through trash mobs.

14:04.620 --> 14:11.620
This druid actually soloed Onyxia and was able to do it all by themselves and posted videos all over the internet.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.620
And so, of course, what has to happen next right after that happens?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.620
A paladin's got to go and do the same thing.

14:16.620 --> 14:23.620
So, it's kind of like this druid threw down the gauntlet and then a paladin went and did the same thing.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.620
Went and slayed Onyxia all by themselves.

14:25.620 --> 14:31.620
So, which is kind of a feat to kill what was once a 40-man boss all by your little self is kind of cool.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.620
And I got to say, you guys have been listening to this show long enough.

14:34.620 --> 14:38.620
You know that I'm getting more and more into WoW.

14:38.620 --> 14:42.620
And I've been experiencing the endgame content in it, which is kind of new for me.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.620
Because when I played Final Fantasy XI for all those years, I never got the endgame.

14:45.620 --> 14:46.620
That was all a mystery for me.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.620
But now I'm actually running the 10s and the 25s.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.620
We've been in Serpent Shrine Cavern.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.620
We've been in Tempest Keep.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.620
Now, granted, I haven't gotten to Sunwell yet.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.620
But I feel like I'm making a lot more progression in this game than I ever did with any other MMO.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.620
So, it's been very interesting.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.620
The social dynamics of it is just...

15:01.620 --> 15:04.620
These games are something else. Something else.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.620
I would love to guest on a WoW show, by the way.

15:06.620 --> 15:13.620
If you know of a Warcraft podcast that needs the Rob Roberts perspective, I'd love to go visit someday.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.620
Because WoW is fun to talk about.

15:15.620 --> 15:20.620
But I'm not going to beat you over the head with it here on this show.

15:20.620 --> 15:32.620
Well, in more World of Warcraft news, there is a 27-year-old gamer who is now in Deep Kaka.

15:32.620 --> 15:37.620
He met this girl playing World of Warcraft.

15:37.620 --> 15:40.620
Fell in internet love.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.620
And they ran away together.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.620
Less than three forever.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.620
Now the girl is 14.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.620
Doh.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.620
Oopsie.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.620
She said she was 18 online.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.620
They're actually found in Franklin County, Washington in a campground.

15:58.620 --> 16:04.620
In a campground? Like a KOA?

16:04.620 --> 16:08.620
Is that what it is? This guy and the girl ran off together to a KOA?

16:08.620 --> 16:10.620
They went camping.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.620
They were camping.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.620
Waiting for that spawn.

16:14.620 --> 16:18.620
That was really good.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.620
But, um, yeah.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.620
That's just really sad.

16:23.620 --> 16:31.620
I mean, but what really way is there to control if someone lies or not on the game, right?

16:31.620 --> 16:33.620
Well, I don't think they were lying.

16:33.620 --> 16:38.620
I think she was just touched in the head and, you know, decided,

16:38.620 --> 16:40.620
Hey, I'm going to go meet this guy.

16:40.620 --> 16:41.620
He seems really nice.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.620
But mom, I'm in love.

16:44.620 --> 16:47.620
Love does cause certain chemical reactions that have mimicked insanity.

16:47.620 --> 16:50.620
I'm not joking.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.620
I don't know. I could see why he did that.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.620
So what's the follow up? Is he in jail now or what happened?

16:54.620 --> 16:55.620
Did they do it?

16:55.620 --> 16:57.620
I don't know.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.620
Let me see.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.620
It actually doesn't say. It says he's in legal trouble.

17:04.620 --> 17:05.620
Here we go.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.620
Well, he's in legal trouble. He must have crossed the line.

17:07.620 --> 17:11.620
Um, there's likely what's really running away together is kind of just cross the line.

17:11.620 --> 17:13.620
None of that physical stuff really even needs to be involved.

17:13.620 --> 17:16.620
Well, it doesn't say what exactly he said.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.620
Good old prison time coming in his way, it says.

17:19.620 --> 17:22.620
But he's, I think, out on parole right now.

17:22.620 --> 17:23.620
Huh?

17:23.620 --> 17:25.620
So the question is, will she wait for him?

17:25.620 --> 17:29.620
And M 64 in chat changed his nickname to Chris Hansen and said, Hi there.

17:29.620 --> 17:33.620
Why don't you have a seat right there?

17:33.620 --> 17:37.620
Anyhow, now that's a dateline I'd like to see.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.620
Catching the wow predators.

17:40.620 --> 17:43.620
He's got his hair slicked back. He's wearing a black T-shirt.

17:43.620 --> 17:49.620
Yeah, it looks like it looks like the kind of guy who, uh,

17:49.620 --> 17:55.620
and the sad thing is that I know people like this who just sit in front of their computer

17:55.620 --> 17:59.620
and, you know, have a microwave right beside it and eat nothing but ramen.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.620
You can't put a microwave next to your computer because it'll interfere with your speakers.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.620
Got to put it a few feet away.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.620
Bobby Blackwell has an obvious point I didn't even think about.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.620
He says he crossed state lines with a minor. It's kidnapping.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.620
Yeah.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.620
So that's why he's in trouble.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.620
He should have done his research first, dumbass.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.620
There's campgrounds all over the place.

18:18.620 --> 18:21.620
Frisbee said, there's KOAs everywhere.

18:21.620 --> 18:24.620
Frisbee says, what level did she say she was?

18:24.620 --> 18:27.620
I didn't say anything about it.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.620
All right. She was over 18.

18:30.620 --> 18:33.620
She told me she was 70.

18:33.620 --> 18:38.620
All right. Well, anyway, people acting stupid and giving games like, wow, a bad name,

18:38.620 --> 18:40.620
definitely make us a little bit angsty.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.620
And when we hear about stupid people running away with 14-year-olds across state lines,

18:44.620 --> 18:45.620
we get a little bit angsty.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.620
And you know what that means?

18:46.620 --> 18:49.620
It's time for a little segment we call F.U. of the Week.

18:49.620 --> 19:10.620
My F.U. of the Week.

19:10.620 --> 19:16.620
Well, really, I guess it's more, I guess, self-directed because I'm really nervous about something

19:16.620 --> 19:19.620
that's going to be going on tomorrow.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.620
And I want it to go well.

19:21.620 --> 19:27.620
And I don't want to do my nervous habit of talking, like, wildly while this is going on out of nerves.

19:27.620 --> 19:30.620
So F.U. to nerves.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.620
Just out of concern for the listeners, though, it's not medical.

19:33.620 --> 19:34.620
You're not in, like, any type of...

19:34.620 --> 19:36.620
I'm going in for a job interview, okay?

19:36.620 --> 19:37.620
Well, I just want to clarify.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.620
People don't need to be worried about your health or anything.

19:39.620 --> 19:40.620
You're fine there.

19:40.620 --> 19:45.620
No, I don't have any type of degenerative diseases other than the walking pneumonia

19:45.620 --> 19:47.620
and the bookies that you flew.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.620
All right.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.620
You didn't have to tell.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.620
I'm sorry.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.620
I just wanted to make sure the listeners didn't get worried.

19:52.620 --> 19:53.620
Loki.

19:53.620 --> 20:02.620
I guess F.U. to stupid workers at Round Table for taking 40 minutes to make two-minute breadsticks.

20:02.620 --> 20:03.620
What can I say?

20:03.620 --> 20:06.620
I used to work there, so I know how long it takes.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.620
It does not take 40 minutes.

20:08.620 --> 20:12.620
And God, hire some more intelligent people for your front counters.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.620
I hated that shit.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.620
My F.U. of the week goes to my tooth.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.620
I've been having all this pain in my mouth, one of my teeth.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.620
I know it's probably got to have a root canal or something.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.620
It's got to be a bad situation.

20:23.620 --> 20:24.620
It's been hurting a lot.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.620
I don't think I've ever had a tooth hurt this bad.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.620
I'm, like, constantly having to take Tylenol or Advil or something.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.620
And that means I'm actually going to have to go to the dentist on Monday.

20:32.620 --> 20:33.620
Now, here's the thing, you guys.

20:33.620 --> 20:34.620
I just...

20:34.620 --> 20:35.620
I don't like the dentist.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.620
And a lot of people have those, like, fears of the dentist.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.620
It's not that I'm necessarily afraid of the dentist.

20:39.620 --> 20:42.620
I just hate the dentist because dentists are, like, used car salesmen.

20:42.620 --> 20:44.620
They try to sell you stuff you don't need, I swear to God.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.620
Not my dentist.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.620
My last dentist, well, this is a true story about an experience I had with a dentist.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.620
Maybe it's just HMO versus PPO.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.620
Now that I have PPO, it'll be better.

20:51.620 --> 20:57.620
But the last dentist I had tried to tell me I needed a replacement crown that was $1,200.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.620
Now, granted, I did need the replacement crown,

20:59.620 --> 21:04.620
but what they neglected to tell me was that my plan would also cover a crown that was only $300.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.620
So they were purposely trying to rip me off.

21:06.620 --> 21:11.620
You know how, like, how much that turns me off to dentists in general?

21:11.620 --> 21:13.620
Like, it makes me feel like I'm going to go buy a used car.

21:13.620 --> 21:18.620
And I agree that, like, dental health is important and I'm a fucking moron for not going to the dentist more often.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.620
But if that's the kind of treatment I'm going to get, do you understand why I don't like going?

21:21.620 --> 21:23.620
Exactly. I totally understand.

21:23.620 --> 21:27.620
Let's see. Well, I'll tell you later.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.620
I told you earlier that, you know, I'd recommend my dentist to you.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.620
Right.

21:31.620 --> 21:32.620
Because they've never...

21:32.620 --> 21:37.620
And I haven't been to the dentist, except for this one, since I live, like, in the third grade,

21:37.620 --> 21:39.620
because we didn't have insurance for that. We couldn't afford it.

21:39.620 --> 21:40.620
Right.

21:40.620 --> 21:43.620
So, okay. Po.

21:43.620 --> 21:50.620
But the dentist that I go to, they give you cookies when you leave.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.620
Aww.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.620
And they're good cookies.

21:53.620 --> 21:54.620
How cute.

21:54.620 --> 21:59.620
And the chairs, I fall asleep in their chairs. They're memory foam.

21:59.620 --> 22:03.620
And both of them are professional, so they don't try to sell you shit you don't need.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.620
They just put it out there and let you review it if you want it.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.620
That's what I need. That's what I need.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.620
When I got all of my fillings done, they said, you have...

22:11.620 --> 22:14.620
Here's a composite. Here's this one. Here's this one. Here's this one.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.620
This is what the pros and cons of this one are.

22:16.620 --> 22:17.620
This is the pros and cons of this one.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.620
That's perfect.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.620
Okay, if this... Now, see, I did end up... Before Jamie knew, I had problems.

22:22.620 --> 22:26.620
I just scheduled with somebody else. A coworker recommended him, and he's, like, right around the corner.

22:26.620 --> 22:27.620
So, you know.

22:27.620 --> 22:30.620
So I'm going to check it out and hope it's a little better, because what I like about this,

22:30.620 --> 22:34.620
it's just one guy, his assistant, and the front desk lady, all in...

22:34.620 --> 22:37.620
You know, it's not a big company, and those big companies tend to screw you more.

22:37.620 --> 22:42.620
Well, also, this one's not a big one, and also, if you go to my dentist, I get a $50 gift certificate for all of them.

22:42.620 --> 22:43.620
Motives.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.620
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

22:45.620 --> 22:51.620
But they do... But, you know, because they're a small business, they offer perks to their clients.

22:51.620 --> 22:55.620
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Rob, my dad wouldn't do that to you.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.620
See, that's awesome that, you know, we know somebody whose dad's a dentist.

22:58.620 --> 23:02.620
I would go to a family or friend dentist in a heartbeat. I don't know any.

23:02.620 --> 23:06.620
Unfortunately, SSJ100Matt's in New York City, and I can't exactly fly to New York to have my dental work done.

23:06.620 --> 23:10.620
That's not very cost-effective.

23:10.620 --> 23:15.620
So that's going to do it for the FUs of the week. Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

23:15.620 --> 23:21.620
You know, and it doesn't really matter. I mean, we're not that rich yet to where we can fly out to New York to get your dental work done.

23:21.620 --> 23:27.620
Maybe someday. When we are, you know, rich internet celebrities, I will totally fly out to New York just to see SSJ100Matt's dad.

23:27.620 --> 23:31.620
Because at least I know I can, like, trust him, because Matt will put in a good word for me.

23:31.620 --> 23:37.620
Well, I'm not sure if this guy's a rich internet celebrity. I know he's probably a celebrity, at least in the gaming world.

23:37.620 --> 23:41.620
But Nolan Bushnell, he has a biopic that's being made about him.

23:41.620 --> 23:47.620
And, you know, must we forget that he also, you know, founded Chuck E. Cheese.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.620
Wait, they're making a biopic about Nolan Bushnell?

23:49.620 --> 23:50.620
Yes.

23:50.620 --> 23:55.620
What's the story there? Just the fact that he invented all these things?

23:55.620 --> 24:00.620
I mean, the story is Chuck E. Cheese is fucking awesome. Or was fucking awesome.

24:00.620 --> 24:01.620
I stand corrected.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.620
The pizza sucks ass.

24:03.620 --> 24:06.620
It doesn't matter. They had cool arcades at one time.

24:06.620 --> 24:07.620
In the 80s.

24:07.620 --> 24:11.620
I say one time, because all those arcades have been replaced with neon lights and ticket redemption machines.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.620
They had that Ferrari game. That Ferrari game's cool.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.620
Anyways, so apparently...

24:16.620 --> 24:20.620
Dude, I should have my 30th birthday at Chuck E. Cheese. How awesome would that be?

24:20.620 --> 24:29.620
Apparently, Paramount Pictures has picked up the movie, and Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be attached to star in the movie as Nolan Bushnell.

24:29.620 --> 24:33.620
That's kind of weird, in a way.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.620
How does he look like...

24:35.620 --> 24:37.620
Makeup? I don't know.

24:37.620 --> 24:41.620
Wait, Black Wolf says, Sky, they won't let you. They won't let me.

24:41.620 --> 24:42.620
What?

24:42.620 --> 24:43.620
They won't let me.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.620
You're a paying customer.

24:45.620 --> 24:51.620
They won't let me have my birthday party. I've had some friends try. They got kicked out because they have no kids.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.620
That's... It's not racist, but it's ageist.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.620
It's because I'm gay.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.620
No.

24:57.620 --> 24:59.620
What?

24:59.620 --> 25:03.620
Why don't we invite people we know who have children?

25:03.620 --> 25:06.620
Because I don't want no kids ruining my birthday party.

25:06.620 --> 25:10.620
But people that we know would know how to raise their children, right?

25:10.620 --> 25:17.620
I would take it to the management and just complain and then make a big fuss about it and get on the news.

25:17.620 --> 25:23.620
Great. Then my fa... I would be the poster child for 30-year-olds wanting to have their birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.

25:23.620 --> 25:26.620
I'm not sure I really, really want that.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.620
You know what you do, Rob?

25:28.620 --> 25:29.620
What?

25:29.620 --> 25:32.620
You just don't tell them you're having your birthday party.

25:32.620 --> 25:36.620
Vandalous in chat says, Incredible Pizza Factory is more fun anyway.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.620
I don't know if he's talking about John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

25:39.620 --> 25:42.620
I don't know. Here's the thing with John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.

25:42.620 --> 25:48.620
I would agree that it's a pretty rad place and that the food is a slight step better, only slight.

25:48.620 --> 25:49.620
You can't...

25:49.620 --> 25:53.620
But here's the thing. There's no animatronic animals. And for that, it fails.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.620
We could put Loki in a teagull costume.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.620
That might be a little better.

25:58.620 --> 26:01.620
I'm not an animatronic animal and normally I dress up in a teagull costume.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.620
But it's my birthday!

26:03.620 --> 26:04.620
I don't give a shit.

26:04.620 --> 26:05.620
Rob, Rob, Rob.

26:05.620 --> 26:07.620
Ranma makes the best suggestion ever.

26:07.620 --> 26:08.620
What?

26:08.620 --> 26:10.620
Dave and Busters.

26:10.620 --> 26:12.620
Too far! Too far!

26:12.620 --> 26:13.620
I used to go every year.

26:13.620 --> 26:14.620
I don't care.

26:14.620 --> 26:15.620
I went to Disneyland last year.

26:15.620 --> 26:16.620
I want to go to Disneyland for my birthday.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.620
Oh my god, Rob. Let's go to Disneyland.

26:18.620 --> 26:23.620
Wait, Black Wolf finishes the story here. I know this has nothing to do with games, but I don't care.

26:23.620 --> 26:26.620
Adults wanting to go to Chuck E. Cheese is a very important topic.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.620
I mean, my friends were just trying to go there for lunch one day.

26:29.620 --> 26:30.620
Company outing.

26:30.620 --> 26:35.620
They were stopped at the door and told that they weren't welcome because they might have overrun the place for the kids.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.620
Dude, we went there in college once and they didn't say anything.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.620
We went there on a weeknight once in college and they didn't say anything.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.620
We've walked in the...

26:42.620 --> 26:43.620
Don't ask me why.

26:43.620 --> 26:50.620
Back when Qzar was open, someone actually ordered pizza from Chuck E. Cheese because they had takeout also.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.620
Why?

26:51.620 --> 26:53.620
I don't know.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.620
Who always said, mmm, mmm, I'm craving Chuck E. Cheese, crapola pizza?

26:56.620 --> 26:59.620
I think it was mmm, mmm, I'm pole.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.620
I have to say this.

27:02.620 --> 27:11.620
And by the way, when I was in high school after I graduated, we decided to all go to Chuck E. Cheese's

27:11.620 --> 27:14.620
and I got humped by the person playing Chuck E. Cheese.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.620
He was also my boyfriend at the time.

27:16.620 --> 27:17.620
Oh, well, okay.

27:17.620 --> 27:19.620
Ha! You were in the furries!

27:19.620 --> 27:20.620
No.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.620
Oh, my God, you had sex with Chuck E. Cheese.

27:22.620 --> 27:23.620
No.

27:23.620 --> 27:24.620
It was...

27:24.620 --> 27:25.620
Furry lover!

27:25.620 --> 27:27.620
It was silly.

27:27.620 --> 27:36.620
But, you know, we went in there and, you know, I had a bunch of my friends there and, you know, we ate shitty pizza

27:36.620 --> 27:42.620
and played skee-ball until we puked and it was fun and no one ever did shit about it.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.620
CC's Pizza is an East Coast chain anyways.

27:44.620 --> 27:45.620
There's a CC's.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.620
Not around here.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.620
Oh, Black Wolf is around CC's Pizza. I've never heard of it.

27:48.620 --> 27:49.620
There's a CC's Pizza.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.620
They have this, like, thing that's on TV they're talking about.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.620
My brother worked at CC's Pizza.

27:52.620 --> 27:56.620
A buffet and stuff and it's like five bucks and the pizza looks like it's worth every penny.

27:56.620 --> 28:00.620
It's like five dollar cardboard shit pizza.

28:00.620 --> 28:04.620
DJ Morpheus says, there are times that Loki sounds like an animatronic animal.

28:04.620 --> 28:11.620
Well, I also have to say, Patty said in our chat room that she got kicked out of there when she was 18 and had a kid with her.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.620
Alright.

28:12.620 --> 28:13.620
Jeez.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.620
I have a better suggestion for you.

28:15.620 --> 28:16.620
It's just cruddy.

28:16.620 --> 28:17.620
It's not quite Chuck E. Cheese.

28:17.620 --> 28:18.620
It's not quite...

28:18.620 --> 28:19.620
Go to Scandia.

28:19.620 --> 28:24.620
Not the Scandia in Sacramento, but the Scandia more towards Vallejo.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.620
Okay.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.620
That's where you need to go.

28:26.620 --> 28:34.620
Because there's no water park. There's no Super Ghetto Kids raining around. It's just arcade, go-karts, and golf. Like, God intended it.

28:34.620 --> 28:43.620
And they have, like, tons of SNK machines and the Taito games.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.620
I've never set foot in there. I drive by it every time I go to the bay.

28:45.620 --> 28:46.620
Oh my God, they're great.

28:46.620 --> 28:49.620
Is that what they actually advertise on the sign, Loki?

28:49.620 --> 28:53.620
Arcade, golf, and go-karts. The way God intended it.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.620
That's the way it should be.

28:55.620 --> 28:56.620
Alright.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.620
So what, Leonardo DiCaprio, what?

28:58.620 --> 29:02.620
He's gonna play, I guess, Nolan Bushnell. And I think the movie's actually entitled Atari, so...

29:02.620 --> 29:03.620
Interesting.

29:03.620 --> 29:04.620
Uh-huh.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.620
Alright.

29:05.620 --> 29:10.620
Orange Lounge Fudio? No, now it's, like, Orange Lounge Chuck E. Cheesio.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.620
Uh, anyhow, let's go...

29:12.620 --> 29:17.620
We were talking about games, okay? Games, Nolan Bushnell created Chuck E. Cheese. We were talking about Chuck E. Cheese.

29:17.620 --> 29:18.620
It's still relevant.

29:18.620 --> 29:22.620
This is a topic that always comes up on our show, actually, is whatever happened to awesome arcades?

29:22.620 --> 29:23.620
Right?

29:23.620 --> 29:24.620
Exactly.

29:24.620 --> 29:25.620
It's a myth.

29:25.620 --> 29:26.620
Exactly.

29:26.620 --> 29:27.620
They've fallen into obscurity.

29:27.620 --> 29:32.620
Well, it's sad that, you know, our kids are only gonna have to hear stories about, you know, the arcades.

29:32.620 --> 29:37.620
It's gonna make it sound like, you know, when our parents told us about the sock-hop. Woohoo!

29:37.620 --> 29:39.620
I don't wanna ever hear about the sock-hop.

29:39.620 --> 29:40.620
Right.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.620
Okay, no more tangents, just...

29:44.620 --> 29:47.620
Are you sure? One more? You good for one more, Jamie?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.620
Come on, Tangent Lounge Radio.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.620
That was the Ferret's Tangent.

29:52.620 --> 29:53.620
Continue!

29:53.620 --> 29:54.620
You're withholding, I know it.

29:54.620 --> 29:55.620
I am.

29:55.620 --> 29:56.620
Alright, EverQuest.

29:56.620 --> 29:57.620
These are good cashews.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.620
Orange Lounge EverQuest deal.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.620
Here's the deal with EverQuest.

30:02.620 --> 30:06.620
Sony Online Entertainment, also known as SOE, or as I call it, S.O.E.

30:07.620 --> 30:12.620
S.O.E. has reactivated all of the G.O.N. players.

30:12.620 --> 30:22.620
Basically, if you left, you know, if you abandoned EverQuest some time ago, S.O.E. has reactivated your account for two free months for both EverQuest and EverQuest 2.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.620
That is everybody.

30:23.620 --> 30:26.620
So if you left the game, it's time to come back.

30:26.620 --> 30:31.620
Here's the thing. S.O.E. also included all of EverQuest's expansions in those accounts.

30:31.620 --> 30:38.620
And you get bonuses to help your players that are, you know, out of date, get them up to speed.

30:38.620 --> 30:43.620
So, kinda interesting there. It's called the Living Legacy campaign.

30:43.620 --> 30:46.620
So it's basically a way to try to sucker people back into EverCrack.

30:46.620 --> 30:51.620
Hey, it's two months for free. Just take a break from World of Warcraft and go grief some people. There you go.

30:51.620 --> 30:57.620
You know what? EverQuest is one of those games I never really got into because I got into Final Fantasy XI instead.

30:57.620 --> 31:03.620
Like, about the time I would have gotten into EverQuest, somebody showed me, like, Japanese Final Fantasy XI and I was like, ooh, I'm waiting for this.

31:03.620 --> 31:07.620
It's Final Fantasy and it's online. What more do you want?

31:07.620 --> 31:12.620
Here's what I worry about. Final Fantasy is going to do something like this in the future and I'm going to be like, kind of want.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.620
Final Fantasy XIV.

31:14.620 --> 31:15.620
Kind of want.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.620
Actually, it's just Final Fantasy online or something.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.620
Alright. Anyhow.

31:19.620 --> 31:20.620
Stuff.

31:20.620 --> 31:21.620
Yes.

31:21.620 --> 31:22.620
And nonsense.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.620
Like, this nonsense. No, I'm kidding.

31:24.620 --> 31:28.620
Can I read a comment from chat real quick? I gotta say it. Because it's about the arcade thing we're talking about.

31:28.620 --> 31:34.620
Sairan in chat says, I only hear stories about awesome arcades and it makes me cry that there are no more.

31:34.620 --> 31:46.620
I guess we have to realize that there actually are, you know, I don't want to say younger kids, but, you know, teenagers that are now teenagers that were, like, you know, too young to remember when we were teenagers that are already going through this.

31:46.620 --> 31:47.620
It kinda sucks.

31:47.620 --> 31:48.620
Yeah.

31:48.620 --> 31:52.620
They will never know how awesome it was to stand on a booster seat to play Crystal Castles.

31:52.620 --> 31:57.620
Well, it's like even when I was in high school, and I'm sorry for going off on another little small thing.

31:57.620 --> 31:58.620
It's what we do here.

31:58.620 --> 32:04.620
Because, you know, but when my little brother Matthew got hit by a car when he was six and I was still a freshman in high school.

32:04.620 --> 32:14.620
And I remember, you know, being dropped off at the mall to go see a movie with my friend Jennifer and we went and hung out in the arcade.

32:14.620 --> 32:16.620
Like, for hours!

32:16.620 --> 32:19.620
Exactly! Tilt, they used to have tilts in the malls and stuff like that.

32:19.620 --> 32:20.620
Which is now Hot Topic.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.620
Well, Tilt got purchased by Namco.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.620
I can tell you that because I worked for Namco Arcade when all this was going on.

32:27.620 --> 32:33.620
But we had Aladdin's Castle inside, we actually got a cyber station later.

32:33.620 --> 32:38.620
The Aladdin's Castle got turned into a cyber station and they opened an Aladdin's Castle in the mall across the street.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.620
I worked at them both.

32:39.620 --> 32:46.620
Anyway, that was actually right around the time that arcade started, you know, sucking was when I quit working in one.

32:46.620 --> 32:50.620
But anyway, I was there all day. I was playing Samurai Shodown 2.

32:50.620 --> 32:54.620
We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that day.

32:54.620 --> 32:55.620
Rad.

32:55.620 --> 32:59.620
Except that right when we beat the game they freaking turned off the machine.

32:59.620 --> 33:00.620
Fuckers.

33:00.620 --> 33:04.620
Anyway, and these guys paid for me to play. It was awesome because they wanted to do a four person game.

33:04.620 --> 33:05.620
They're like, here we have money.

33:05.620 --> 33:06.620
Okay.

33:06.620 --> 33:07.620
They paid you to do it four way?

33:07.620 --> 33:08.620
Oh baby.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.620
I played Leonardo, so that's kind of cheating.

33:10.620 --> 33:14.620
But anyway, and I can't believe I still remember.

33:14.620 --> 33:18.620
It's because my brother was injured that that really stuck out in my mind.

33:18.620 --> 33:22.620
But you know, we played, there's air hockey.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.620
Arcades, like only a few have air hockey anymore.

33:25.620 --> 33:26.620
That is sad.

33:26.620 --> 33:27.620
That is fucking criminal.

33:27.620 --> 33:31.620
I mean, what arcade is perfect if you're not dodging air hockey pellets?

33:31.620 --> 33:36.620
Speaking of perfect arcade, and I apologize for a moment to our international audience.

33:36.620 --> 33:41.620
This is a very local reference, but DJ Morpheus brought this up and I have to know if Jamie's ever been here.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.620
What?

33:42.620 --> 33:44.620
Did you ever go to Sam's Town in Cameron Park when it was up and running?

33:44.620 --> 33:45.620
Oh yeah.

33:45.620 --> 33:49.620
Oh my God, that place was incredible.

33:49.620 --> 33:50.620
Dan told me about the mine shaft.

33:50.620 --> 33:53.620
Oh, that was, oh, I miss arcades.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.620
He said that part of it was underground.

33:55.620 --> 33:57.620
Yes, the mine shaft, it was a golf course.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.620
The golf course started underground.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.620
It was like a mine shaft and you would go upstairs.

34:00.620 --> 34:02.620
It would go above ground after like the first three holes.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.620
I've seen the remnants of it.

34:04.620 --> 34:11.620
There was also an part of the arcade where there was a two floor arcade upstairs had all the little kids games like Noah's arc and stuff.

34:11.620 --> 34:15.620
And then downstairs, my God, they had everything, everything you can imagine.

34:15.620 --> 34:21.620
You know what arcade, I think this is one of the last of the great arcades was the bird cage arcade that we had here.

34:21.620 --> 34:22.620
No.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.620
Cause the bird cage, I'm sorry for people.

34:24.620 --> 34:27.620
I know this is way out of that, but this is where a lot of the new.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.620
We're having a moment.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.620
Damn it.

34:29.620 --> 34:31.620
Bird cage arcade got all of the new fighting games.

34:31.620 --> 34:32.620
All of them.

34:32.620 --> 34:35.620
It didn't matter if they had to import them, they got them.

34:35.620 --> 34:45.620
And, um, we actually, uh, well at the time, and I'm not going to say his name because a lot of people in the DDR community, especially doesn't, but a friend of ours, uh, worked for Capcom for awhile.

34:45.620 --> 34:52.620
And it was funny watching him just completely hand people, their asses one handed, you know, at any of the fighting games.

34:52.620 --> 35:00.620
And it was just like, and that was like right when I first moved out here and then they started tearing down all the stuff that made the bird cage area cool.

35:00.620 --> 35:11.620
Like the theater where Rocky was and the arcade and they're trying to take out the element that was, they said they're trying to, to make it safer for better clientele.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.620
But in reality, I think that it's hurt the business.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.620
They're fucking rich white people ruining our culture.

35:15.620 --> 35:20.620
I know, but is it just me or have you seen more business businesses there though?

35:20.620 --> 35:24.620
Closed since keeping that place alive is the fact there's a Barnes and Noble.

35:24.620 --> 35:25.620
I don't like it anymore.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.620
There's no comic shop.

35:27.620 --> 35:33.620
There's no bowling alley. There's no dollar store that sells t-shirts that say, fuck this.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.620
And now international imports is going out of business.

35:35.620 --> 35:36.620
That's sad.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.620
I know one more thing I got to say about the local stuff.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.620
Sam's town.

35:39.620 --> 35:43.620
Uh, DJ Morpheus says the mine shaft was like a third of the size of Sam town.

35:43.620 --> 35:44.620
And that's true.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.620
Like, let me put it this way.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.620
Sam's town.

35:46.620 --> 35:53.620
Like when you went to go spend your tickets, you spent them in a general store and you could buy like, you know, like those little candy cane things.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.620
Like some tastes like licorice and some tastes like mint.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.620
Like you can spend, I mean, fond memories of that place.

35:58.620 --> 35:59.620
That's shit.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.620
Sam's town was like around since my mom was a child and stuff like that too.

36:02.620 --> 36:03.620
I mean, all right.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.620
And then they had to tear it down.

36:04.620 --> 36:09.620
Sorry for the moment of, as a, what, who is it in chat that said we were old people?

36:09.620 --> 36:10.620
Yeah.

36:10.620 --> 36:11.620
Cason.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.620
I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, but you did call us old people.

36:12.620 --> 36:15.620
It says an old person's moment.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.620
All right.

36:16.620 --> 36:19.620
No, it's just even the fact that we had awesome shit and you don't.

36:19.620 --> 36:20.620
Yes.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.620
We're reminiscing about better times, kids.

36:22.620 --> 36:23.620
All right.

36:23.620 --> 36:26.620
Except that I didn't walk to school both ways uphill.

36:26.620 --> 36:27.620
So whatever.

36:27.620 --> 36:28.620
All right.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.620
Sorry, Jamie.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.620
You can do your story about a story, right?

36:31.620 --> 36:32.620
Yeah.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.620
Strong bad game.

36:35.620 --> 36:40.620
The game is called strong bad school game for attractive people made by telltale.

36:40.620 --> 36:43.620
And it is going to be an episodic humor game.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.620
But guess what?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.620
It's delayed.

36:47.620 --> 36:54.620
It's release has been pushed to July.

36:54.620 --> 36:55.620
It doesn't.

36:55.620 --> 36:58.620
Well, it says from June from the original release month into the next month.

36:58.620 --> 37:05.620
So from June to July to polish it up a little bit.

37:05.620 --> 37:10.620
And I really want to play this game because it's awesome.

37:10.620 --> 37:14.620
And I love the trailers for it, but.

37:14.620 --> 37:17.620
Well, it's obviously directed at me because it does say awesome people.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.620
But here's this is attractive people.

37:19.620 --> 37:20.620
Here's the thing.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.620
If you want to know a little more, that's me too.

37:21.620 --> 37:24.620
If you want to know a little more about the real insight to what's going on here,

37:24.620 --> 37:27.620
listen to the very end of Bobby Black Wolf show this week when we're on.

37:27.620 --> 37:28.620
I'm not going to spoil it,

37:28.620 --> 37:31.620
but he gives a little more insight as to what could be possibly up with this delay.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.620
So I'll leave you with that little teaser.

37:33.620 --> 37:36.620
I will be sure to you do that right now.

37:36.620 --> 37:37.620
Download it right now.

37:37.620 --> 37:38.620
Go do it right now.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.620
Because we're broadcasting and I love fix our bandwidth.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.620
So go now.

37:42.620 --> 37:43.620
No.

37:43.620 --> 37:47.620
Lucky saved the show from what you and I.

37:47.620 --> 37:52.620
There is an interesting job posting over in Nintendo's official Web site.

37:52.620 --> 37:56.620
The job posting was for a software hardware tester,

37:56.620 --> 38:01.620
and their description of duties would be creating and executing a test plan for

38:01.620 --> 38:04.620
Wiis USB devices.

38:04.620 --> 38:10.620
And it goes on saying, you know, writing, testing, documentation, whatever.

38:10.620 --> 38:17.620
Anyways, but the whole fact is that there's going to be Wii USB devices.

38:17.620 --> 38:18.620
Storage, perhaps?

38:18.620 --> 38:19.620
Hard drive?

38:19.620 --> 38:20.620
Hello?

38:20.620 --> 38:21.620
OMG.

38:21.620 --> 38:22.620
Please?

38:22.620 --> 38:25.620
That would be smart.

38:25.620 --> 38:29.620
So cross your fingers that that's what that actually means.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.620
I hope so.

38:31.620 --> 38:32.620
DMN in chat says,

38:32.620 --> 38:36.620
Sky is so old he owes Nolan Bushnell a quarter.

38:36.620 --> 38:37.620
Nice.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.620
Asshole.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.620
Hey DarkSakura, you know what else I miss?

38:42.620 --> 38:44.620
Roller rinks.

38:44.620 --> 38:48.620
I've actually been to the one on Auburn, the Foothills skating rink,

38:48.620 --> 38:50.620
like in the last couple of years.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.620
I went there too.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.620
And I'm still fucking awesome at it.

38:53.620 --> 38:54.620
Alright.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.620
I'm not going to let this show get derailed.

38:56.620 --> 38:57.620
I'm just kidding.

38:57.620 --> 38:59.620
Rob and I are going to go roller skating next week and video tape it.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.620
I almost played DDR and roller skates once.

39:01.620 --> 39:03.620
I thought you didn't want to be on camera.

39:03.620 --> 39:04.620
I will be on camera.

39:04.620 --> 39:05.620
I'll be video taping it.

39:05.620 --> 39:06.620
Fine.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.620
I said I wanted to go ice skating actually.

39:08.620 --> 39:09.620
I've never been.

39:09.620 --> 39:10.620
I hate ice skating.

39:10.620 --> 39:11.620
Must happen.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.620
I love ice skating.

39:12.620 --> 39:13.620
Anyway.

39:13.620 --> 39:14.620
Okay.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.620
Rob's story.

39:16.620 --> 39:17.620
Virtual Console.

39:17.620 --> 39:18.620
SNK.

39:18.620 --> 39:19.620
What more do you need to know?

39:19.620 --> 39:22.620
There's lots of SNK stuff apparently heading to Virtual Console soon.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.620
Not just Samurai Shodown as you heard in part A,

39:24.620 --> 39:27.620
but apparently Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury 2, Burning Fight,

39:27.620 --> 39:31.620
they are all apparently on their way to the Virtual Console.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.620
This is the ESRB of course spilling all this.

39:34.620 --> 39:37.620
Also on the list, Dig Dug is on the list.

39:37.620 --> 39:40.620
Now that's probably not the arcade version because you don't really see that on the Wii.

39:40.620 --> 39:43.620
Probably the NES version because it didn't really come out anywhere else

39:43.620 --> 39:45.620
that the Wii currently supports.

39:45.620 --> 39:48.620
By the way, just so you know, also on the ESRB,

39:48.620 --> 39:50.620
it's completely unrelated, PlayStation 3,

39:50.620 --> 39:54.620
ratings for The Last Guy and Wipeout HD have both appeared

39:54.620 --> 39:57.620
and hopefully that means that they are almost on their way.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.620
So we'll be looking forward to seeing those games soon

40:00.620 --> 40:02.620
because Wipeout is kind of cool.

40:02.620 --> 40:07.620
For our Pokemon fans that are listening,

40:07.620 --> 40:10.620
and I'm not going to say that Pokemon makes everything better,

40:10.620 --> 40:18.620
but GameStop is going to be giving away a download of a free Pokemon.

40:18.620 --> 40:25.620
Forgive me if I mispronounce this, but Deoxys,

40:25.620 --> 40:28.620
which is a psychic type Pokemon that has four different forms.

40:28.620 --> 40:32.620
If you've got Pokemon Diamond or Pearl, you can go to a GameStop

40:32.620 --> 40:39.620
and download it and then they'll harass you about pre-ordering stuff.

40:39.620 --> 40:41.620
But hey, you can have Pokemons.

40:41.620 --> 40:44.620
I know, it looks freaking bizarre.

40:44.620 --> 40:48.620
Very interesting comment from chat about kind of the tangent conversations we were having

40:48.620 --> 40:50.620
and it comes from Sairan who was kind of commenting earlier

40:50.620 --> 40:52.620
about being young and missing a lot of this.

40:52.620 --> 40:53.620
It says something very interesting.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.620
People robbed Jamie Matt's age, had awesome arcades.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.620
People in the 60s, my mom's generation, had Woodstock,

40:59.620 --> 41:02.620
the Beatles, the Summer of Love, and other cool things.

41:02.620 --> 41:07.620
The majority of my generation just has the Iraq War, George Bush, and shitty music.

41:07.620 --> 41:11.620
The Otaku demographic at least has somewhat of a boom of the anime industry,

41:11.620 --> 41:13.620
but that's about it.

41:13.620 --> 41:19.620
That's a very, very good summary of it.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.620
There's probably cool things about your generation,

41:21.620 --> 41:25.620
but you're not really going to realize them until like 20 years later.

41:25.620 --> 41:28.620
That's the thing is that right now in this 2000s,

41:28.620 --> 41:30.620
have they ever come up with the name for the O's?

41:30.620 --> 41:31.620
The O-O's or whatever?

41:31.620 --> 41:32.620
The O's.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.620
The O's.

41:33.620 --> 41:36.620
Here in the O's, the 80s are making a comeback.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.620
Just like how in the 90s, the 70s are making a comeback.

41:38.620 --> 41:40.620
Here's the thing.

41:40.620 --> 41:44.620
When we start getting into the 10s, the 90s will make a comeback

41:44.620 --> 41:46.620
and all those things you forgot about will be cool again.

41:46.620 --> 41:50.620
So then again, it's going to be the late 60s, early 70s look again.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.620
Perhaps.

41:52.620 --> 41:56.620
Maybe in the 10s people are going to go back to the Victorian look,

41:56.620 --> 42:01.620
which people kind of did in the early 80s now that I think about it.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.620
It's kind of cool.

42:03.620 --> 42:04.620
Just something to think about.

42:04.620 --> 42:05.620
I don't know.

42:05.620 --> 42:10.620
Sometimes trends have a way of coming full cycle as folks that were teens become 30s.

42:10.620 --> 42:11.620
I have to share this with you.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.620
Sauce says it's the Ot.

42:14.620 --> 42:16.620
I realize that's like the technical term for it,

42:16.620 --> 42:21.620
but who really says that as freely as they say the 80s, the 90s?

42:21.620 --> 42:23.620
You're not going to see it on VH1.

42:23.620 --> 42:25.620
I love the Ot.

42:25.620 --> 42:26.620
People in Europe?

42:26.620 --> 42:27.620
I guess.

42:27.620 --> 42:31.620
Because if I'm correct, zero is referred to as Ot.

42:31.620 --> 42:34.620
Alright, whatever, whatever.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.620
Black Wolf brings up a good point.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.620
In 20 years you may be telling young kids about how there was this internet

42:39.620 --> 42:42.620
where you could look up anything and read about anything

42:42.620 --> 42:47.620
and all the information was equal kind of referencing the net neutrality laws

42:47.620 --> 42:51.620
that are kind of making waves this week.

42:51.620 --> 42:52.620
That's true.

42:52.620 --> 42:54.620
You guys did grow up in the internet age.

42:54.620 --> 42:55.620
That is something.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.620
We didn't really have that when I was in early high school.

42:57.620 --> 43:00.620
It was BBS is for life, bitch.

43:00.620 --> 43:03.620
When we were some of these people's age,

43:03.620 --> 43:09.620
the internet actually was still military only and illegal for anyone else to network.

43:09.620 --> 43:14.620
You totally just said when I was your age.

43:14.620 --> 43:16.620
I understand though.

43:16.620 --> 43:19.620
When we were little, it was true.

43:19.620 --> 43:25.620
The internet has been in existence since, I do believe, 1972 or 74 around that time.

43:25.620 --> 43:26.620
Whenever Al Gore invented it, right?

43:26.620 --> 43:27.620
Whenever.

43:27.620 --> 43:30.620
But it was military use only, and if anyone was caught networking

43:30.620 --> 43:37.620
like in the early 80s or so, they actually could be arrested for it.

43:37.620 --> 43:44.620
I remember my friend's dad who is in his 60s now is an engineer,

43:44.620 --> 43:50.620
and he was talking about lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.

43:50.620 --> 43:53.620
I thought that was pretty crazy.

43:53.620 --> 43:54.620
Yeah, anyway.

43:54.620 --> 43:55.620
All right.

43:55.620 --> 43:56.620
Just thought that might be a little perspective.

43:56.620 --> 43:58.620
Lots of reminiscing tonight.

43:58.620 --> 44:00.620
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

44:00.620 --> 44:01.620
Sorry, kids.

44:01.620 --> 44:06.620
Well, a show that likes to reminisce as well, Video Games Live,

44:06.620 --> 44:11.620
will be coming, or they have announced actually 50 different shows for their world tour.

44:11.620 --> 44:15.620
Of course, Video Games Live, for those who may not remember,

44:15.620 --> 44:19.620
is the show that has all sorts of orchestrated music from video games,

44:19.620 --> 44:24.620
including Legend of Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, et cetera.

44:24.620 --> 44:28.620
This year though, I'm glad to see that it looks like around August

44:28.620 --> 44:33.620
they're going to be coming towards San Jose, so we'll be able to hit that up actually.

44:33.620 --> 44:46.620
All over the place, including Canada, France, Scotland, the United States, Portugal, Brazil,

44:46.620 --> 44:53.620
China, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Moscow, Russia, and Norway and Sweden.

44:53.620 --> 44:56.620
So when they say world tour, they don't mean just like US and Canada.

44:56.620 --> 44:57.620
They mean the freaking world.

44:57.620 --> 44:58.620
Yes.

44:58.620 --> 44:59.620
That's pretty cool.

44:59.620 --> 45:00.620
That'd be fun to travel on.

45:00.620 --> 45:05.620
Like I said, for those folks local to Orange Lodge Radio here,

45:05.620 --> 45:12.620
August 26th you've got San Jose at the Performing Arts Center during the Envision 08.

45:12.620 --> 45:15.620
That convention's going to be going on.

45:15.620 --> 45:19.620
And then also they're coming back around again in San Francisco.

45:19.620 --> 45:21.620
No date on that though.

45:21.620 --> 45:26.620
So, awesome.

45:26.620 --> 45:29.620
Sorry, I was distracted because they're telling Commodore 64 jokes in chat,

45:29.620 --> 45:35.620
and that's just all kinds of awesome.

45:35.620 --> 45:36.620
But not as awesome as-

45:36.620 --> 45:39.620
I used to play kicks on an Apple IIe.

45:39.620 --> 45:43.620
But look, Commodore 64 and Apple IIe, not nearly as awesome as boobs.

45:43.620 --> 45:44.620
And that's what the next story is about.

45:44.620 --> 45:45.620
It's about boobs.

45:45.620 --> 45:47.620
Mine are pretty awesome.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.620
We have to talk about boobs in Age of Conan.

45:49.620 --> 45:51.620
Here's something kind of interesting.

45:51.620 --> 45:56.620
Apparently what happened is that suddenly one day in Age of Conan,

45:56.620 --> 45:57.620
all the boobs like disappeared.

45:57.620 --> 46:00.620
Well, they didn't like disappear, but they got really tiny.

46:00.620 --> 46:02.620
I guess all the boobs shrink.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.620
They shrank.

46:04.620 --> 46:09.620
Apparently what happened, code from an earlier patch actually went into a new patch,

46:09.620 --> 46:14.620
and it caused the morph values for certain models in the game to become altered.

46:14.620 --> 46:18.620
And the only thing that people seem to be noticing though are the boobs.

46:18.620 --> 46:20.620
The boobs have their own value?

46:20.620 --> 46:21.620
What?

46:21.620 --> 46:22.620
That's awesome.

46:22.620 --> 46:26.620
Apparently people notice, and they actually have before and after shots here on various websites.

46:26.620 --> 46:27.620
Well, you know what that means.

46:27.620 --> 46:31.620
If something can be shrunk, it can be made bigger.

46:31.620 --> 46:36.620
This is what I love, is that the company actually posted a clarification saying,

46:36.620 --> 46:41.620
quote, your breasts should be back to normal soon.

46:41.620 --> 46:45.620
Well, thank you for saving the day.

46:45.620 --> 46:46.620
Wow.

46:46.620 --> 46:50.620
By the way, it should be noted, man boobs were not affected at all.

46:50.620 --> 46:51.620
Wow.

46:51.620 --> 46:52.620
Man boobs were safe.

46:52.620 --> 46:56.620
Also safe this week, your emails, but not for much longer,

46:56.620 --> 46:58.620
because we're about to turn Dark Sakura loose on them.

46:58.620 --> 47:00.620
But not for very much longer?

47:00.620 --> 47:04.620
Not for very much longer.

47:04.620 --> 47:07.620
I've got to open the mailbag.

47:07.620 --> 47:09.620
No, I am.

47:09.620 --> 47:13.620
Mailbagorangelaungeradio.com, here we go, Dark Sakura, take it away.

47:13.620 --> 47:14.620
Stuff.

47:14.620 --> 47:18.620
This is the best, this is like my email of the week just because of how it ends.

47:18.620 --> 47:21.620
Hey Rob and Dark Sakura, how goes it?

47:21.620 --> 47:22.620
What about Loki?

47:22.620 --> 47:23.620
Say hi to Loki too.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.620
F Loki.

47:24.620 --> 47:29.620
My name is Taibon and I'm currently living in Kenya with my sisters.

47:29.620 --> 47:32.620
I'm sorry, I'm not going to think of power thirst.

47:32.620 --> 47:35.620
The region here is really poor, but we're fortunate enough to be able to afford

47:35.620 --> 47:37.620
and import video games from Europe.

47:37.620 --> 47:41.620
We finally got hold of Grand Theft Auto and I've been enjoying it a lot.

47:41.620 --> 47:43.620
I don't have much to say, just wanted to say hi

47:43.620 --> 47:46.620
and let you guys know that you've got listeners all around the world.

47:46.620 --> 47:49.620
I've been listening to the podcast every week for the past year now

47:49.620 --> 47:52.620
and it's one of my favorites, Keep Up The Good Work, Taibon.

47:52.620 --> 47:58.620
This message is brought to you by Samara's Cafe, home of the never-ending dirt.

47:58.620 --> 47:59.620
That's what I thought was awesome.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.620
P.S., hope you read my email on the show.

48:01.620 --> 48:02.620
It'll definitely make my week.

48:02.620 --> 48:06.620
Okay, look, I think you totally just got punked.

48:06.620 --> 48:07.620
Here's the reason why.

48:07.620 --> 48:09.620
Look, because I saw that email sitting in there.

48:09.620 --> 48:10.620
Look at the sender name.

48:10.620 --> 48:13.620
It does not match the person who says they are.

48:13.620 --> 48:14.620
I know.

48:14.620 --> 48:22.620
However, the reason why I thought it was awesome was because of the never-ending dirt.

48:22.620 --> 48:25.620
I want this person to prove that they're actually in Kenya somehow.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.620
Send us a picture of Kenya.

48:27.620 --> 48:30.620
You need to be standing in front of a building flying the Kenya flag.

48:30.620 --> 48:31.620
No.

48:31.620 --> 48:33.620
Making a gang sign or something.

48:33.620 --> 48:34.620
I don't know.

48:34.620 --> 48:35.620
Making the OLR gang sign, whatever that is.

48:35.620 --> 48:37.620
Take us a picture of Samara's Cafe.

48:37.620 --> 48:39.620
Oh, yes, we want a picture of Samara's Cafe.

48:39.620 --> 48:40.620
There you go.

48:40.620 --> 48:41.620
Perfect.

48:41.620 --> 48:42.620
Perfect.

48:42.620 --> 48:43.620
And the never-ending dirt.

48:43.620 --> 48:44.620
Yes.

48:44.620 --> 48:49.620
But the other reason I'm thinking it's awesome is I'm also thinking of power thirst now.

48:49.620 --> 48:54.620
And then I'm thinking, why would someone send us, and I apologize if we're not getting punked.

48:54.620 --> 48:56.620
Just realize my suspicions.

48:56.620 --> 48:57.620
A couple things about your email.

48:57.620 --> 48:59.620
Raise some eyebrows.

48:59.620 --> 49:03.620
Why would you punk us with that?

49:03.620 --> 49:05.620
You crazy kids.

49:05.620 --> 49:07.620
Well, I'm thinking that it could be a nickname too.

49:07.620 --> 49:10.620
So I'm going to suspend, you know.

49:10.620 --> 49:11.620
Well, that's right.

49:11.620 --> 49:14.620
And I apologize profusely if you are the real deal.

49:14.620 --> 49:17.620
If you are a legitimate person that lives in Kenya, you know what?

49:17.620 --> 49:20.620
Actually, I'm going to save the email and I'm going to run it through an IP hunt.

49:20.620 --> 49:21.620
Yeah.

49:21.620 --> 49:22.620
Oh, there you go.

49:22.620 --> 49:23.620
There you go.

49:23.620 --> 49:29.620
Not that we are coming out and saying it was just that we never expected to get email from Kenya.

49:29.620 --> 49:33.620
But then again, we have a caller who calls from...

49:33.620 --> 49:34.620
We get Sweden.

49:34.620 --> 49:35.620
We get Argentina.

49:35.620 --> 49:36.620
We get...

49:36.620 --> 49:37.620
Why not Kenya?

49:37.620 --> 49:38.620
I know.

49:38.620 --> 49:39.620
Why not?

49:39.620 --> 49:42.620
I want somebody from Wales to call me so I can listen to a sexy Welsh accent.

49:42.620 --> 49:43.620
Next email.

49:43.620 --> 49:44.620
Okay.

49:44.620 --> 49:45.620
Just a quick...

49:45.620 --> 49:47.620
Okay, this is from Robert M.

49:47.620 --> 49:49.620
Just a quick thought about the Wii storage.

49:49.620 --> 49:52.620
In addition to download virtual console and WiiWare titles,

49:52.620 --> 49:55.620
game saves seem to take a pretty big chunk of hard drive space.

49:55.620 --> 50:00.620
Elibits, for instance, uses about 100 blocks and Brawl save files well over 120.

50:00.620 --> 50:03.620
I assume that EA Sports games use large blocks as well,

50:03.620 --> 50:06.620
as most likely will the upcoming Animal Crossing game,

50:06.620 --> 50:09.620
the GameCube one actually fills an entire grey memory card

50:09.620 --> 50:12.620
and comes with a spare card for that reason.

50:12.620 --> 50:19.620
And if it's a game that uses WFC and you can't move the save to your SD card for backup,

50:19.620 --> 50:22.620
I have no idea what should be done about...

50:22.620 --> 50:24.620
I'm sorry, I have no idea what should be done about this.

50:24.620 --> 50:28.620
How many free blocks does a clean Wii with nothing but the disc channel

50:28.620 --> 50:30.620
and no game saves have anyway?

50:30.620 --> 50:35.620
I have Mario Kart Wii from my Gamefly list and I haven't gotten online with it yet

50:35.620 --> 50:39.620
since I've been busy with other things, mostly Dr. Mario Online RX.

50:39.620 --> 50:44.620
So anyone there or in OLR me has a chance to compete in that one?

50:47.620 --> 50:49.620
He has a good question. I'm actually not sure.

50:49.620 --> 50:53.620
How many blocks come on a brand new Wii? Isn't it like 1400 about?

50:53.620 --> 50:54.620
Maybe the chat room goes a little bit...

50:54.620 --> 50:57.620
I don't know. I think blocks are stupid for measurement anyways on there.

50:57.620 --> 50:58.620
True that.

50:58.620 --> 51:03.620
Just fucking kilobytes, man. That's what everybody uses nowadays.

51:03.620 --> 51:05.620
Megabytes.

51:05.620 --> 51:06.620
Gigabyte?

51:06.620 --> 51:08.620
You know, it's something that people can understand.

51:08.620 --> 51:11.620
This game takes a terabyte of saving space.

51:11.620 --> 51:14.620
Yeah, instead of Microsoft points and shit like that.

51:14.620 --> 51:15.620
Well...

51:15.620 --> 51:16.620
It's hard.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.620
Anyway, next email.

51:18.620 --> 51:19.620
Yes, Preeze?

51:19.620 --> 51:21.620
Hey, DarkSakuraSky and Loki.

51:21.620 --> 51:22.620
Hey.

51:24.620 --> 51:25.620
I was just saying hey.

51:25.620 --> 51:26.620
Hey.

51:26.620 --> 51:27.620
Hey!

51:27.620 --> 51:31.620
I'm a long time listener from Canada known as D.Vay in the chat room.

51:31.620 --> 51:32.620
Hi.

51:32.620 --> 51:33.620
Hey, Jamie.

51:33.620 --> 51:34.620
What do gay horses eat?

51:35.620 --> 51:36.620
Hey!

51:39.620 --> 51:41.620
Okay, I'm not gonna do the other joke.

51:42.620 --> 51:43.620
So yes, listener from Canada.

51:43.620 --> 51:44.620
Okay.

51:45.620 --> 51:48.620
I know Loki is all into PSP hacks and homebrew stuff like that,

51:48.620 --> 51:52.620
but recently I just bought myself a DS with a flash cart that I ordered online.

51:52.620 --> 51:54.620
You got a ninja pass!

51:54.620 --> 52:00.620
Anyway, my question to Loki is have you experience with DS homebrew before or do you even give a shit?

52:00.620 --> 52:05.620
And so do you have any good links that can guide me in the right passage?

52:05.620 --> 52:07.620
Thanks guys for making my weekly days and...

52:07.620 --> 52:08.620
Weekly days? Okay.

52:08.620 --> 52:09.620
And keep up the good work.

52:09.620 --> 52:14.620
By the way, I was gonna submit a GTA radio entry if it weren't for my MacBook crapping out on me.

52:14.620 --> 52:19.620
This message has been brought to you by Olive Garden, home of the never-ending flow of saggy granny birthday parties.

52:19.620 --> 52:20.620
Nice.

52:21.620 --> 52:22.620
You know what? Fear not.

52:22.620 --> 52:23.620
I'm still trying to get that Portal win.

52:23.620 --> 52:27.620
I am told that All Games is going to be stepping up the number of contests that they do.

52:27.620 --> 52:31.620
So there will be more opportunities to get in on the fun and big prizes eventually.

52:31.620 --> 52:37.620
We should have like a best message brought to you by contest for our emails.

52:37.620 --> 52:40.620
We do have some stuff to give away and I think we're gonna do it next week.

52:40.620 --> 52:41.620
Okay.

52:41.620 --> 52:42.620
I have an idea.

52:42.620 --> 52:45.620
Okay. Uh-oh. Let's hide.

52:45.620 --> 52:54.620
But no, I still meant to download Still Alive and my week has just been in utter chaos so I haven't had a chance to do it yet.

52:54.620 --> 53:02.620
But I do have a Ninja Pass so as soon as I can find my SD card reader then I will be making use of the downloads and I will let you know what I think.

53:02.620 --> 53:07.620
No, I plan on buying one of these. I'm poor right now so I can't.

53:07.620 --> 53:11.620
So yeah, that's the only problem right now.

53:11.620 --> 53:18.620
Oh, I know someone who does regular shipments of them because if you order like ten of them you get free shipping or something.

53:18.620 --> 53:20.620
So next time this goes on I'll let you know.

53:20.620 --> 53:23.620
Well, it still doesn't make me not poor.

53:23.620 --> 53:27.620
But yeah, I plan on buying one because I mean they look cool.

53:27.620 --> 53:34.620
My whole thing before was if I was ever going to buy one it was just to play import games on anyways.

53:34.620 --> 53:37.620
Because I'm not going to buy every fucking import game out there.

53:37.620 --> 53:45.620
In fact, most of the games I do play on my PSP that are not legit are just to try them out so I can talk about them on the show.

53:45.620 --> 53:50.620
And I don't intend on keeping them because fuck, I don't play my PSP really right now anyways.

53:50.620 --> 53:53.620
I just play more of my 360 and Grand Theft Auto.

53:53.620 --> 53:57.620
But yeah, that's pretty much the only interest I have on that stuff.

53:57.620 --> 54:00.620
So yeah, we for that matter play all import games sometimes.

54:00.620 --> 54:03.620
I don't even really play that many import games.

54:03.620 --> 54:08.620
Just mainly, well I play Mario Kart but that's not import so.

54:08.620 --> 54:09.620
There you go.

54:09.620 --> 54:12.620
Actually, I'm going to be importing a game.

54:12.620 --> 54:13.620
What could that be?

54:13.620 --> 54:19.620
Because I have a new 2DX controller. I'm actually thinking about importing Happy Sky.

54:19.620 --> 54:20.620
Really?

54:20.620 --> 54:21.620
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

54:21.620 --> 54:28.620
Because you know, I've been wanting to get back into playing 2DX because I used to, I wasn't nearly as good as you are but.

54:28.620 --> 54:30.620
I was talking about that the other week actually.

54:30.620 --> 54:35.620
But I've got, I can start, I actually have two of the same kind of controller now and can do double.

54:35.620 --> 54:37.620
I've been trying to learn double.

54:37.620 --> 54:43.620
You know I still have all those arcade parts that I remember how I was going to build the controllers for the 2DX and pop music and all that stuff.

54:43.620 --> 54:44.620
Still have all those.

54:44.620 --> 54:47.620
I would pay you to build me an arcade style controller.

54:47.620 --> 54:48.620
For pop music?

54:48.620 --> 54:52.620
No for, well for pop music yeah too because I have a bunch of pop music too.

54:52.620 --> 54:57.620
I have the full size buttons for it. They're like 8 bucks each. Sucks.

54:57.620 --> 55:04.620
Well, next email comes from one of our listeners in the UK.

55:04.620 --> 55:06.620
Hi OLR, it's Guy.

55:06.620 --> 55:07.620
Hi Guy.

55:07.620 --> 55:08.620
Hi Guy.

55:08.620 --> 55:12.620
I once sent you a letter regarding what time I could listen live to the show. I'm in the UK.

55:12.620 --> 55:18.620
Now I'm back with another England slash America question. I want to know what the reception for GTA 4 was in America.

55:18.620 --> 55:23.620
It was really hyped in England but everyone forgot about it when it came out because it was exactly the same as the others.

55:23.620 --> 55:30.620
Was it the same in America? I'm sorry if it's been covered but I've had school exams and haven't listened to the cast recently.

55:30.620 --> 55:31.620
Pip pip guy.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.620
He said pip pip. That's cute.

55:33.620 --> 55:38.620
Well we did kind of talk about it in part A that worldwide they've sold 8.5 million.

55:38.620 --> 55:41.620
Was that worldwide or just here in America that they sold 8.5 million?

55:41.620 --> 55:42.620
It was probably worldwide.

55:42.620 --> 55:43.620
I think it's worldwide.

55:43.620 --> 55:51.620
11 million have gone to store shelves so it's been doing very well and I would tend to once say the majority of that is happening in America.

55:51.620 --> 55:59.620
And no I'm not really hearing a lot of it's too much like the others. I think honestly if it is too much like the others that's okay for a lot of people here.

55:59.620 --> 56:09.620
Well honestly and you know me I wasn't at all interested in Grand Theft Auto 4 but Dan's been borrowing our friend George's copy for a while and he's been kind of getting into it.

56:09.620 --> 56:17.620
You know actually doing the missions and his friend Will's been just you know fucking off on everything in that game and doing whatever the hell he wanted to and trying to get as drunk as possible.

56:17.620 --> 56:21.620
He got so drunk on his character that he couldn't walk. I thought it was funny.

56:21.620 --> 56:28.620
But anyway I've actually kind of gotten into watching them play it just because you know I like picking out stuff.

56:28.620 --> 56:31.620
Like the piss water reference that cracked me the hell up.

56:31.620 --> 56:35.620
Here's something else to consider. Grand Theft Auto has been selling systems here.

56:35.620 --> 56:36.620
It has.

56:36.620 --> 56:43.620
PlayStation 3's especially. I don't know if it's name recognition or what but there's a lot of people that have been picking up PS3's just for this game.

56:43.620 --> 56:45.620
The Sony Grill.

56:45.620 --> 56:50.620
And Blu-ray player too. They go oh it plays Blu-rays and Grand Theft Auto 1.

56:50.620 --> 56:51.620
And it cooks burgers.

56:51.620 --> 56:52.620
So there you go.

56:52.620 --> 56:54.620
Thank you Guy.

56:54.620 --> 56:55.620
Bye Guy.

56:55.620 --> 56:56.620
Bye Guy.

56:56.620 --> 56:57.620
Hey guys and girl.

56:57.620 --> 56:58.620
Pip pip.

56:58.620 --> 57:02.620
Thank you. I know I'm awesome. I get my own hello.

57:02.620 --> 57:06.620
Anyway I have been listening for about four years. Oh God four years.

57:06.620 --> 57:09.620
And I hardly ever email you but I thought this was worth it.

57:09.620 --> 57:15.620
I work in an office job and often listen to music and one time I decided I should listen to your podcast at work.

57:15.620 --> 57:20.620
It entertained me so well for the three hours that it makes the rest of the day pass by incredibly slowly.

57:20.620 --> 57:24.620
Not just and not even my music is working anymore.

57:24.620 --> 57:28.620
I have even dipped into some archives just to have something to listen to that good.

57:28.620 --> 57:33.620
I tried a few other podcasts but nothing compared to keep up the good work. I love the tangents and never let them end.

57:33.620 --> 57:35.620
Well you got a lot of them tonight.

57:35.620 --> 57:39.620
Plus he has the best email ever.

57:39.620 --> 57:43.620
And.

57:43.620 --> 57:47.620
Sorry Jamie had to whisper that to me so we did not give out the poor guy's email address.

57:47.620 --> 57:49.620
But that is a pretty radical.

57:49.620 --> 57:51.620
That's hard core dude. Hard core.

57:51.620 --> 57:54.620
Like Itagaki is probably going to kick your ass for taking that name.

57:54.620 --> 57:56.620
He wants it.

57:56.620 --> 57:58.620
He wants your email bad.

57:58.620 --> 58:01.620
I got to say though we've actually kind of heard a lot about.

58:01.620 --> 58:05.620
In fact when when because Part B has been kind of late the past two weeks and that's my fault.

58:05.620 --> 58:09.620
And I've actually been kind of getting flack from the people who listen to us at work.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.620
Like why weren't we up for them to listen to Thursday or Friday at work.

58:12.620 --> 58:17.620
So I know there's a lot of people that use us to pass the day by at work and I really really apologize for that.

58:17.620 --> 58:20.620
Of course we are only three hours of show a week.

58:20.620 --> 58:24.620
You know hopefully maybe one day we'll be able to put out a little more other specials and things.

58:24.620 --> 58:29.620
But if you're looking for other shows that are quality check out our family at all games dot com.

58:29.620 --> 58:31.620
There's some great shows there. Will you like all of them.

58:31.620 --> 58:35.620
Probably not because the shows all talk about different types of games.

58:35.620 --> 58:37.620
You know and there's.

58:37.620 --> 58:42.620
But that's kind of what makes the network cool is that you have different gamer bases talking about all different types of things.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.620
There's bound to be at least one other show on there you're like.

58:45.620 --> 58:48.620
What were you laughing at Loki.

58:48.620 --> 58:49.620
Nothing.

58:49.620 --> 58:51.620
What is this.

58:51.620 --> 58:54.620
Read an email dark soccer I have to spy on Loki and see what he's watching.

58:54.620 --> 58:59.620
I do want to thank Rob with two B's who sent us presents.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.620
For our sixth anniversary.

59:01.620 --> 59:09.620
And I will check them out in a bit but I wanted to thank you very much for sending us your my cook rewards.

59:09.620 --> 59:11.620
Yes and I saw that too.

59:11.620 --> 59:16.620
So big thank you. We will definitely figure out a way to work those in to our anniversary show.

59:16.620 --> 59:20.620
Here's the thing he's watching that is really Tiger Claw was telling me about this before the show.

59:20.620 --> 59:25.620
But someone has done a shot for shot remake of the introduction to the naked gun.

59:25.620 --> 59:31.620
But in Grand Theft Auto 4 using the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine they have recreated the intro to the naked gun.

59:31.620 --> 59:33.620
And Loki's laughing his ass off.

59:33.620 --> 59:36.620
I'm going to have to look for that when I get home Tiger Claw give you the link.

59:36.620 --> 59:39.620
Just Tiger Claw send it to the mailbag.

59:39.620 --> 59:41.620
So Jamie can look it up at home.

59:41.620 --> 59:42.620
Thanks.

59:42.620 --> 59:53.620
Hey guys I'm about to get a 360.

59:53.620 --> 59:58.620
If I like first person shooters what would I get except for the obvious ones.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.620
Any other game recommendations will be thanked.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.620
Thanks.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.620
Keep up the great work.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.620
I'm sorry what system was it.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.620
360.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.620
360 first person shooters.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.620
Call of Duty 4.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:16.620
I don't know you kind of when you say besides the obvious ones.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.620
Well the obvious ones are the good ones usually.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.620
That's why they're kind of obvious.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.620
So you kind of I don't know.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.620
I guess you know you're probably asking the wrong people.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.620
Because I don't think a lot of us are super into first person shooters as much as we are say RPGs and adventure games.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.620
I'm really not myself.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.620
But I will say this orange box.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:36.620
If you overlook that some great first for not just portal but half life.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.620
Half Life 2.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.620
Half Life 2 is freaking great.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.620
It's like the best first person shooter deal.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.620
It's a better deal than Halo.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620
Because Halo is just one game.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.620
Orange box is like five.

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.620
Otherwise I know I might take a little flack for saying this.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.620
And it's not really for hardcore first person players.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.620
But I liked Prey.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.620
There was a lot about Prey I liked.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620
Sauce is Iron Man.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620
And I think.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.620
Okay.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.620
I think one reason that I liked Prey was that since you couldn't really die in it.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.620
Like it was kind of a first person shooter for dummies.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.620
The only problem with Prey is that it ended a little early.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.620
But the music was awesome because it's.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.620
What's his name?

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.620
Jeremy Sole.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.620
Sole or something like that.

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.620
Jeremy Sole.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.620
The same guy who did the music for Oblivion.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.620
Did the music for Prey.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.620
The music is great.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.620
And it's like ten bucks probably at this point.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.620
So.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.620
Okay.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.620
There's my recommendation I guess.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:30.620
Well I was checking this and I think that it's because the Kenya email was a Gmail account.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.620
It's reading an America IP.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.620
Mm hmm.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:40.620
But Google is international and they do run out of the United States.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.620
So.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.620
We'll see.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.620
Send us a picture.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.620
We're waiting for the picture of the cafe.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.620
Or either.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.620
Look.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.620
Either send us a picture of the cafe or fess up that you were fake.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.620
And just tell us why.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.620
I mean we don't care at this point.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620
We read the email.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.620
But I've got to know why that.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.620
Why did she have to read that.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.620
I mean was it a dare.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.620
I don't get it.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.620
All right.

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.620
Anything else?

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.620
I'm checking the inbox to see if we got it right.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.620
No but we did get one.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.620
This is pokey man's.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.620
I'm going to read next week.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.620
All right.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.620
So tune in next week for more mailbag.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.620
Hey speaking of interactivity the Skype line will be open very soon but we got two more

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.620
stories for you before you get the Skype line which we're kind of keeping short tonight

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.620
we're trying to keep our show a little short tonight because we've got other things we

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.620
got to get to for tomorrow but we will get at least a couple of calls in after these

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.620
two quick stories looking.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.620
Well home is coming out this year.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.620
So says Sony.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.620
But.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:39.620
They say now it's going to be released in the fall as an open open working beta.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.620
I guess that's a fancy way of saying well it's not really done yet but we're releasing

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.620
it anyways.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.620
Really when they think about it I guess it's kind of like every single game that comes

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.620
out nowadays anyway.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.620
Well also you know there's a lot of pretty much anything Google does and Google launches

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:58.620
is a beta you know so is it kind of like that thing where it's like well we're launching

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.620
this and it's going to have all these awesome features but don't blame us if it sucks because

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.620
it's a beta.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.620
No I don't think so that that's that may work for Google because they're always improving

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.620
their services and stuff.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:13.620
When it comes to a game company it means we're not done yet but we need to release this

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:17.620
otherwise you're going to get really pissed off at us anyways because I mean same with

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:23.620
games you know there is a big story going out about grid for the Xbox 360 having horrible

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:24.620
freezing issues.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.620
Oops we didn't finish it so now we got to finish on the back end.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.620
I mean that's what it all comes down to anyways because they need to get it out you know as

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:38.620
soon as possible to meet their marketing campaign or whatever whatever at least it's coming

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:42.620
out I guess and either way people have been playing it in beta.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.620
I don't know I don't to be honest I don't think home is going to be as big as they're

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.620
hoping it's going to be.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:51.620
I think people are going to find it as being a big waste of time.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:55.620
But we'll see.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:59.620
Sorry for the dead air there I was typing some things in chat real quick.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.620
He was typing of the dead.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.620
Yes I was typing of the dead and I won.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.620
I got a hundred percent.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:10.620
Resident Evil 5 you know they've kind of been accused of being a racist and so on.

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.620
I don't know if you heard about that but you know because in the trailers and stuff you

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.620
know whatever.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:19.620
But here's the thing is that the producer of Resident Evil 5 Jun Takushi has actually

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:23.620
denied saying there is nothing racist about this game you all are just misunderstanding

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.620
the original trailer which I would believe because people are too freaking sensitive

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.620
nowadays.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.620
Come on.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.620
Anybody can be a zombie regardless of race.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.620
Can we all agree on that.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.620
I agree.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.620
Oh go ahead.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:39.620
The very first Resident Evil had zombies of all.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:44.620
By the time they all grayed out they look the same anyway so it doesn't matter.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.620
You know they had to edit the US one because of the zombie biting the head off of some

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.620
guy who looked like Michael Jordan.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.620
What?

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.620
Yeah.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:59.620
In the Japanese biohazard when you go you know when you go in the room and you get the

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.620
I hope this is not Chris's bloodline and everything.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.620
And so you go into the other room.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:09.620
There's a zombie chewing off the neck of one of the team members who had been in there

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.620
before and his head pops off and rolls off.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.620
And it looks like Michael Jordan.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.620
They were supposed to.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:23.620
And however PS1 graphics did they cut that out on the US version in that in that cinematic.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:28.620
They also cut out the part with with Chris lighting up a cigarette you know with this

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:34.620
huge lighter which I've got a Japanese version of biohazard.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.620
So it's not no big freakin deal.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.620
But I thought that that was you know it's the same thing.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.620
Well I mean speaking of like characters and stuff there are going to be there is a new

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:49.620
character in the game who is a black female is going to have a role in Resident Evil 5

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.620
is somebody you can actually include.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:55.620
And see here's the thing is that the question was asked did you put this character in because

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.620
of the fact that you know the trailer showed that you're you know blowing up people in

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.620
Africa and that they're all the zombies and stuff.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:05.620
And to go she said no she's pretty much been there in the beginning.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.620
In terms of the reaction we're in the business of entertainment.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.620
We didn't set out to make a racist game or a political statement.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:17.620
We did feel there was a misunderstanding about the initial trailer which probably was just

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.620
some people being a little bit oversensitive I think because you know anybody can be a

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:26.620
zombie right.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.620
We don't see a lot of fat zombies in Resident Evil do you.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.620
Yes you do.

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.620
Do you.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:38.620
There was a cop in the first one who died and then he came back as a fat zombie.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.620
OK.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.620
I know my video game trivia.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620
All right.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.620
All right.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:49.620
We're going to go to the Skype line here one eight seven seven game O.L.R.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.620
But first I'm told that there is a very important voicemail we're supposed to play that was

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.620
left in the box last night.

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.620
And I'm just thinking about what goes on Saturday overnight.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.620
No I'm thinking about things that go on on all games radio on Saturday night.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:07.620
And I'm a little bit worried about this one so I'm going to go play this voicemail and

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.620
kind of hope that it's not too strange.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.620
We'll see.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:42.620
It's downloading.

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.620
I remember that.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.620
That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.620
I remember that commercial.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.620
That's 30 seconds of all your lives you'll never get back either.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.620
Well every second of your life is a second you'll never get back.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.620
Tiger Claw says we just got bucket rolled.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.620
What the crap.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.620
Is that the new thing now.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.620
Is that replaced Rick rolling.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.620
By the way.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.620
By the way I went to a sushi restaurant last night.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.620
My friend Jim is his birthday is turning 30.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.620
Happy birthday Jim if you're listening.

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.620
Here's the thing.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.620
They actually have a sushi roll called the Rick O roll.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.620
Can you believe that they actually now have sushi called the Rick roll.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.620
Did you get a.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.620
Screw all of you.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.620
Don't they have Ricky O as like a Asian kung fu.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620
I don't know.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.620
But I just.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.620
But of course the whole table looked at it went ha ha ha Rick roll ha ha ha.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.620
And I was just like Rick rolls need to die in a boat fire.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.620
Underwater one thing.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.620
All right.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:42.620
We got calls.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.620
We got calls.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.620
Let's go to the Skype line.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.620
Hi you're on orange on radio.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.620
Who's this.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.620
Ravens dolphin.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.620
Long time no here.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.620
Well hello Ravens dolphin.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.620
Damn it's been a long time since you've managed to be the first caller here on OLR.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.620
What is on your mind.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.620
My friend.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.620
First off what the hell have you been up to.

01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.620
Dead Pixel Live.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.620
Oh yeah.

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.620
You do a show every day here on all games.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620
So you're like Monday through Thursday.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.620
Right.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.620
Yep.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.620
It's close enough to be in every day.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.620
How do you guys go.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:08.620
How long is that show.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.620
Two and a half hours after all games interactive.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.620
What in God's name do you talk about for two and a half hours every day.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.620
Whatever the hell we talk about.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.620
Sometimes we can talk about car chases.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.620
Sometimes we can talk about we fit.

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.620
It's just a potpourri of whatever.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.620
All right.

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.620
Well there you have it here on all games radio.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.620
What time do you start.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.620
You just start whenever all games finishes.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.620
Yeah.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.620
Whenever they reach at and they said all right.

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:32.620
They pull the plug and then we start with our.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.620
The other host is Derek H.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.620
Very cool.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.620
I don't think Derek H. likes our show though.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.620
Which makes me a sad panda.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.620
Don't worry.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.620
One half does.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.620
Why doesn't he love me.

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.620
I want to know why doesn't Derek H. love me.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.620
I don't know.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.620
My fault.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:49.620
I love him.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:50.620
You pass along that message.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:51.620
We here at O.L.R.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.620
We love Derek and we we we hope that that love is reciprocated.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.620
All right.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.620
Would you call in to talk to us about tonight.

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.620
Do things.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.620
Yeah.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.620
It's about Microsoft and the blue ray thing.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.620
I think it's dumb.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.620
Why is it dumb.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.620
Do you think.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.620
Do you think it's B.S.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.620
Or do you think the idea itself is dumb.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.620
I just think it's dumb in general.

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.620
It's like it was like hey MGS4 is coming.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.620
It's like we must combat it with a blue ray player.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:21.620
Just feels like like it just shouldn't be necessary to the Xbox 720.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:26.620
Yes and no because right now you know why why are a lot of people buying PlayStation

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:27.620
threes right now.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:31.620
I kind of said this earlier in the show because it plays Grand Theft Auto 4 and blue rays

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:35.620
Xbox 360 only plays Grand Theft Auto 4 right now it's not really a movie system you know

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.620
yay DVDs but everybody has a freaking DVD player at this point right.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:44.620
Not a lot of people have that in their systems and people I think the normal average Joe

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:49.620
I'm not a gamer but I enjoy the occasional violent video game right.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:54.620
They don't know about all this like download exclusive Xbox 360 stuff.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.620
They don't know about all that stuff.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.620
They just think it's the same damn game.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.620
I agree.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.620
So I you know just something to consider.

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:08.620
I just I agree with Loki with he said if they bundle like a new one in I feel like that's

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.620
suicide.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.620
That'll confuse some people.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.620
You mean actually actually putting a blue ray player as like in the system itself.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.620
Yeah I feel like that's suicide.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.620
I don't the only time I would see that happening is the holidays.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:25.620
I don't know why but isn't it ironic because don't they have to pay money to Sony for each

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.620
one of these because you know blue rays like a trademark of Sony.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.620
You know at this point I think Microsoft will pay it.

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.620
It's just weird.

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.620
It's some odd reason.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.620
Yeah they already got a patent for this.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:42.620
They're like hey we gave the blue ray thing and like people start freaking out.

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:43.620
All right.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.620
Well what else did you want to call us about anything else on your mind tonight before

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.620
we go on.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.620
Sure thing about Okami Wii.

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.620
I got that this week.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.620
And what you think.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.620
I like it.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.620
It's just the only thing that reminds me of Rainbow Bright.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620
OK.

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.620
How does Okami remind you of Rainbow Bright.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.620
Because Rainbow Bright it's all dark and gloomy and you have to fill the world with color.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.620
And this is what the game does.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.620
You fill the world with color.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:09.620
Nice.

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.620
Does that.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620
What was it.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.620
Who is the evil guy in Rainbow Bright.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.620
I can't remember his name.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.620
The murky murky murky.

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.620
Yeah I'm sorry I was seeing of the peculiar purple pie man.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.620
Yeah I keep thinking strawberry shortcake.

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:25.620
Yeah they're so easy to get confused I guess.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.620
All right.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.620
Forget it.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.620
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.620
Dead Pixel Live right after All Games Interactive.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.620
Plug plug plug.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.620
There you go.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.620
Have a good one buddy.

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:36.620
Bye.

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.620
Somebody was looking for more podcasts.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.620
Maybe Dead Pixel Live is up your alley.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620
All right.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.620
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:46.620
Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.620
SSJ100Matt said wow Raven I never thought about it that way.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.620
Who knew that Raven's Dolphin could give such insight here on this program.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.620
Let's see if our next caller does.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.620
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.620
Who's this.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.620
Hi this is Spazinator.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.620
I'm sorry.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.620
Your name is what?

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620
Spazinator.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.620
Spazinator.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.620
You need to go buy it on the PlayStation Network.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.620
Awesome.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.620
Well what's on your mind Spazinator?

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.620
Yeah a couple things.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:16.620
Much of which you kind of sort of touch on on tonight's show especially in part 1.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.620
Now I do have one concern about full caliber 4.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.620
Which is going to be coming out next month.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.620
Especially with all the characters from Star Wars and what not.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:34.620
If you think about it you know how at least in all the Star Wars movies supposedly the

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:39.620
light sabers pretty much cut through like 99% of everything out there.

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.620
Right.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.620
Like limbs and walls and stuff like that.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:52.620
In theory if they want the Star Wars characters in full caliber 4 to be like totally accurate

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.620
and what not wouldn't they be like way overpowered and what not.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:02.620
You know like you know cut off people's legs and totally break down the characters weapons

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.620
and what not.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:08.620
Well I think you know they're probably just going to balance it.

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:10.620
Just like you know when things have crossed over before.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.620
Like you know when Spawn and Link and all those characters showed up before.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.620
You know they just kind of made it work.

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.620
They just balanced it.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.620
And that's just what they're going to do here.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:23.620
And all these kind of crossover games I mean like Capcom versus X-Men.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:28.620
I mean certainly super heroes would overpower these you know generic fighters right.

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.620
X-Men versus Street Fighter hardcore.

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.620
But they just make it work and they figure people are going to suspend disbelief.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.620
And I think that's really what it's about is that you're just supposed to say you know

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.620
what I'm not going to pay attention to all this fact that the light sabers can like cut

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.620
people into a million pieces.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:45.620
I'm just going to you know think how cool it is that I can play you know Soul Calibur

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:49.620
or I can play Darth Vader versus Yoshimitsu and all this stuff you know.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:50.620
Oh yeah.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.620
Yeah I have no doubt that the game is going to be good.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:59.620
You know I'm kind of both a Soul Calibur fan and Star Wars nuts.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:04.620
So you know that thought kind of crossed my mind like a week ago.

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:08.620
So you're okay with this because a lot of people in our chat room earlier were kind

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.620
of like oh why can't they just make Star Wars it's own game.

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.620
Why do they have to have all these Star Wars characters.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.620
You're okay with both kind of living together in the same game.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.620
Oh yeah.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:23.620
You know it's just that little you know I hate to use the word but relatively minor

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.620
you know concerned with the balancing.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.620
Tigerclaw made a very similar observation to what you're saying.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.620
He says in chat here that's one of the things I noticed when I saw the gameplay footage

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.620
of Vader and Soul Calibur IV.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.620
He can literally impale an opponent and throw them.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.620
Normally a light saber would cut through someone effortlessly.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.620
Oh yeah.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.620
So there you have it.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.620
It's a little wattage.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.620
Now Spazinator do you think they ought to make a new Star Wars fighting game.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:53.620
Like if this does really well do you think Namco needs to be paid like a lot of money

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.620
to like make a new Star Wars fighting game.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.620
Like we'll just pretend the other one never happened.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:01.620
Well actually now that you mention it.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:06.620
I did buy the first one for the PlayStation 1 when it came out.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:12.620
And I wouldn't necessarily say it was like horrible like E.T. for it's 2600 bad.

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:17.620
But it wasn't exactly game of the year like Final Fantasy 7 great either you know.

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.620
It was kind of like low low low for me.

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:26.620
So but I wouldn't necessarily you know be opposed to a new Star Wars fighting game though.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:30.620
Hopefully this is Namco putting their feet in the water a little bit and seeing if it's possible.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.620
I don't know.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.620
I don't know.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.620
We can hope.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.620
Go ahead.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.620
Oh go ahead.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.620
Sorry.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:39.620
I was just going to say is there anything else you want to talk about before we go Spazinator.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620
Yeah.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.620
I know that you kind of got away from Final Fantasy 11 and more into WoW.

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:49.620
But that was notwithstanding.

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:57.620
Have you heard anything about like a fan festival like what they had in Anaheim last year.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.620
I have not.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:02.620
But from what I understand Squeenix usually announces those things pre last minute.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:06.620
I mean not like you know the day before but they only give like two months notice.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:10.620
Whereas with Blizzard you know they've already announced hey BlizzCon is going to happen mark the date.

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:14.620
And maybe it's because BlizzCon gets a hell of a lot more people not just because they have WoW.

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:21.620
They also have Starcraft and you know some of those other you know powerhouse games and Diablo 3 rumors are enough to get people to go to.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.620
I haven't heard anything though even though I left Final Fantasy 11.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:30.620
I do keep tabs on the news just to see if there's anything like really cool I'm missing out on.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:31.620
You know I don't know.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:35.620
I spent so much time with that freaking game you can't help but just kind of be curious about it.

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:38.620
It's almost like a bad relationship.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.620
You can't help but wonder whatever happened to your ex.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620
You know what I mean.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:51.620
Yeah honestly I've been playing the PlayStation 2 version of that game for two, two and a half years now and I'm practically addicted to it.

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.620
Even now that I got PlayStation 3.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:18:02.620
And the reason I ask my question is in theory if they hold the Fan Festival this year.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:09.620
You know this will be the first year I can actually afford to literally go across country and go to the Fan Festival.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:15.620
And from what I've been told some of my friends are going to be over there and I've been just starting to go to the festival.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.620
If they hold it in California I might actually try to go.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:25.620
Because it might be a lot of fun especially if it's within driving distance because I think they had one of them in Santa Cruz and that's not that far.

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:27.620
So I could have gone to that.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:32.620
But I just didn't know about it until after it already happened because it was when I was you know not really playing.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:37.620
As a video game journalist to report on the event.

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.620
Well thanks for taking my call.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:42.620
You are welcome.

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.620
We like hearing from people that we don't get to hear from very often so take care all right.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:52.620
Oh I just saw something and then I'll let you go.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:58.620
You know earlier in the show you were asking about that new Commando 3 game.

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:05.620
Yeah that's going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 next week and it's already out for the DS3.

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:13.620
Already got the game and I don't know if there's going to be a difference between the two versions but at least the PlayStation 3 game is pretty good.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.620
Well that's a good sign.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:23.620
So if you guys got the 360 or the PS3 I would seriously suggest investing the $10 for the game.

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:29.620
I will definitely check out the demo and see it's worth it because I am tempted by the beta of the new Street Fighter because I do heart Street Fighter.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:35.620
But yeah I guess that's true it's already out on PS3 so it's good to know that the game is not bad so that you're not like wasting your $10.

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.620
But we'll see when that demo comes out.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.620
All right well have a good one.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.620
All right thanks spazzinator thanks for your call take care buddy.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:48.620
All right we'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we're going to call it a night.

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:50.620
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.620
Oh wow it's Legend of Zaku.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.620
Hey Legend of Zaku.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.620
No show is complete without a call from Legend of Zaku.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.620
Damn right it's been far too long what is on your mind Zaku?

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:10.620
Nothing much just basically just enjoying all my usual stuff you know games on my 360 like Grand Theft Auto 4 and whatnot.

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.620
That's right you upgraded to a 360 not too long ago huh?

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.620
Yeah it's been like about six months.

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.620
What kind of games you been playing?

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.620
Grand Theft Auto obviously.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:28.620
I kicked the shit out of Call of Duty 4 on veterans so that boosted up my achievement scores.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:37.620
But besides that I'm just you know just trying to scrap as many games as possible since you know money's kind of tight right now.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:42.620
But you know it hasn't been so bad.

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.620
You know the new unlock code for DDR2 came out right?

01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:49.620
I did hear something about that that there's some new unlocks.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.620
Tell us about it since we haven't reported on it tonight.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:59.620
I don't know it's like I spent the better part of Friday and Dave and Buster's trying to do that shit and we weren't able to.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.620
Huh it has to be hooked up with the emus.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.620
Are you sure?

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.620
Oh snap so can't.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:15.620
Are you sure because that one actually was an unlock code in which you actually have to input certain you have to hit certain arrows after you enter your credit.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:19.620
I still think it had to be hooked up the emus if I remember correctly.

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.620
Why is that?

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.620
I don't know why. I don't know why they have this kind of.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.620
Does it download the songs or something?

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:31.620
I think it's because there was some other competition thing that went along with like some Zookan Battle 3 or 2 or something like that I don't know.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:38.620
But from what I heard other machines besides the one in Illinois which is the only emus in the country managed to get the code.

01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.620
Managed to get it working.

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.620
Well then your machine doesn't like you.

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.620
Well it just has shitty pads but that's besides the point.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:56.620
Um yeah just looking through I don't know it's just been a rough you know down week for me I just haven't been playing as much because of other things.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:05.620
But I do want to get you know hopefully get something from my PSP probably a bigger memory card so I can start like getting more stuff on that thing.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:14.620
Hey quickly before we go since you still kind of follow the DDR scene and all that and we you know we try I still try to like load DDR Freak and look at the forums once in a while just keep tabs on what's going on.

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.620
There have been like tournaments or big things we ought to be looking forward to?

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:21.620
I maybe.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.620
What about digital life? Usually you're calling in digital life, digital life is that happening this year?

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:29.620
It hasn't been confirmed yet that's the thing.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:38.620
Until I get confirmation I'll let you know but right now I'm not going to jump the gun quickly when I can't really confirm.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:48.620
You know the fact of the matter is I have to you know I keep tabs on the people that know and they'll let us know exactly when you know if and when it's happening this year.

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:52.620
We'll tell you when we're ready dang it that's what they're saying we'll tell you when we're ready.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.620
Right.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.620
Alright.

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.620
So I'm not that's it I'll let you know once I hear a word of it happening.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:04.620
Alright sounds good buddy hey we got to wrap up and close the show you got any parting words for our listener tonight?

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.620
Listeners?

01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.620
Just hack your PSP.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620
Hack your PSP.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:14.620
Alright buddy have a good one.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:18.620
That's some great final words hack your PSP it's awesome.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.620
Alright we're going to do some quick.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.620
This naked gun thing is great.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.620
Did you check that out?

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.620
It's awesome.

01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.620
Alright we're going to do some last minute stories we're actually going to start with Jamie tonight.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:43.620
I just think that you know in He Who Shall Not Be Named more news about him is that he's been well it's not that it's official yet but it's been recommended for a ten year disbarment for his 27 misconduct charges.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:53.620
Also it should be noted that two of his Supreme Court cases were actually dismissed with prejudice meaning he can't file it again.

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:59.620
So I'm hoping the judge says yes and goes for the ten years.

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.620
Again this is about He Who Shall Not Be Named.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.620
Well he was very.

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:06.620
Oh yeah they wouldn't let him read his.

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:13.620
Ten years like long argument or whatever which pretty much called everyone a dumb ass and stuff like that.

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.620
Real class.

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:21.620
Yeah he won the judge didn't allow him to read and he had prepared in advance of course was like whatever dude.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:24.620
So yeah.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.620
He's I think I think it's going to go through.

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:29.620
Prepared my speech and why I'm awesome.

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.620
You want to read it.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620
Anyway.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.620
All right.

01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:35.620
You got something for us.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.620
Yeah Loki what do you got.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:43.620
Some stuff about Halo Wars coming from GamePro.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:56.620
Apparently the latest issue had the exclusive and some magazine scans have already found their way onto the Internet and new things that we found out from it.

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.620
Basically the detail the current control scheme.

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:11.620
There is going to be some new UNC or UNSC vehicles including the vultures Cyclops and Cobras as well as mentions of like a campaign will be a combination of human and covenant worlds.

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:15.620
Also let's see here.

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:22.620
It's going to boast a six player Xbox Live multiplayer and feature two person online co-op.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:27.620
And that's all in GamePro's July issue which should be out soon.

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:33.620
Also we were talking about movies earlier with Leonardo DiCaprio being in the Atari movie.

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:51.620
Well now there's another movie being made Kane and Lynch with Bruce Willis going to be starring in it as Kane Marcus or Adam Kane Marcus I guess which is weird because Billy Bob Thornton apparently is in talks for the role of Lynch.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.620
So it's like that's going to be a classy movie.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.620
I don't know we'll see.

01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:06.620
Sony has apparently stopped production of a couple of games that they were showing off hell I think before the PS3 even came out including Eight Days and The Getaway.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:12.620
Eight Days I believe was that one that they showed the demo for including all the bullets ripping up a car and that kind of stuff.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.620
Oh well not coming out I guess.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:26.620
The Bioshock movie which we talked about I believe last week has been confirmed of course as part of the conference call following Take Two's second quarter earnings.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:44.620
They addressed the questions from different analysts about different topics and they also said that the Bioshock movie will be coming and that it's unlikely that the movie will be released alongside Bioshock 2 but it will probably make it for Bioshock 3.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:50.620
So spoiler Bioshock 2 will be getting a sequel.

01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:52.620
I don't know.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.620
And then finally I forgot to talk about this earlier.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.620
Rock Band the download content for this coming week.

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.620
They've got the MTV 2 pack which is going to feature.

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.620
Crap.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:06.620
Yeah.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.620
Moving to Seattle by the material.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:09.620
I've never heard of them.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.620
A Clean Shot by the Myriad.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:15.620
Bullets and Guns by Them Terribles.

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:21.620
Those are each available for 80 Microsoft points or 240 points for the entire pack.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:28.620
And finally an individual song Girls Who Play Guitars by Maximo Park.

01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:30.620
For also 80 points.

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:31.620
All right.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.620
Is that it for last minute stories.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.620
That is it.

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:34.620
All right.

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.620
Well then that's going to wind down.

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.620
Oh and to answer a question you had.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.620
Hey wait a minute you said OK.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.620
Sorry this is answering questions it's not a story.

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:41.620
All right.

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:45.620
One block equals 128 kilobytes.

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.620
So if you do the math there.

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.620
I believe it's five.

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:50.620
Five hundred blocks.

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:51.620
I don't know.

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:52.620
All right.

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:57.620
Anyhow we're in wrap up the show now it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Laundry.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.620
Oh but not before we get everybody's final thought.

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:09.620
I will start tonight with my final thought and my final thought is that these Haribo Happy Cola gummy candies that are like the little bottles of cola.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:10.620
Are like the yummiest things in the world.

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.620
I love these things.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:13.620
And they're not fat which is awesome.

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:16.620
Dark soccer your final thought.

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.620
I want food.

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:19.620
Real food.

01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:21.620
The kind you can eat and digest.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.620
Loki your final thought.

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.620
My final thought is.

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.620
God damn it.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:41.620
I got to get a hundred percent on Grand Theft Auto IV. Like one. I have to basically unlock the special ability of Packy.

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.620
Basically when you get your friendship up a certain percentage.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:49.620
He'll allow you to call him to give you cars with bombs in them.

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:55.620
And that will kick me over to a hundred percent and I get the achievement and I'm done with the story.

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.620
Cars with bombs awesome.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:00.620
All right.

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.620
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry.

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:05.620

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:37.620
Until we spread all over the world including Kenya right.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.620
He is from Kenya.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.620
All right.

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.620
I'm chatting with him.

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:41.620
All right.

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:42.620
All right.

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:45.620
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.620
