Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, May 11th, 2008, the new Nintendo Channel is up and running,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Burnout Paradise is soon headed to the PC,

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
and the classic first-person shooter is about to get another sequel.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It's where every gamer has a voice.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hi.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
How are you?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm tired.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
You're tired?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
It's been a long weekend.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's been a long everything.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
It's been a hot weekend too, and I'm worried about next weekend

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
because it's supposed to be like 20 degrees hotter,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
and I'm like, we're going to die during the show,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
so I've got to figure out air condition plans.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I have a solution for you.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's that?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
That window, does it have a screen?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It does have a screen on it.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So you can't do a little thingy, I know.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
No.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
You can kick that screen off there.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Take the screen off.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Put in the air conditioner, put a block over it.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
It's not that hard, see those little black things on there?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
That's for pushing the screen off.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
We'll see.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
All right.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
This is now Home Improvement, the podcast.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, and on top of that.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
What?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
It's Studio Improvement.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
The other voice you hear over there, Tech Master Loki,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
since he's talking out of turn.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That's all right.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm talking intern.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
But it's easy and cheap.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
They're not expensive.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I'll figure something out.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
That's why we have a budget.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I've got a week to figure it out.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Which means I'll do something about it on Saturday.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'll worry about it tomorrow.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And how are you doing, Loki?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm doing fine.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Had a good week?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I guess.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
All right.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
All things considered.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
You went out of town today, right?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I went to Oakland, and then I came back from Oakland.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And you're back alive.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Amazing.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oakland sucks.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
All right.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
If you want to join us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Remember All Games listeners?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
We actually don't use the same chat channel right now

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
as the other All Games shows.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Maybe in the future.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
But for right now, we're in our own channel.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
It's Orange Lounge is the channel name on the Game Surge Network.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Or you just go to that website, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
In fact, Act Deaf is in chat tonight,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
and he is calling it Orange Lounge Improvement Radio

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
because it's like improving the lounge in your house

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
or the lounge where I was at.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
All right. Forget it.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Anyhow, lots of fun stuff on tonight's show.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'll tell you all about it.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But first, we always start the show off with a little bit of

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
how was your gaming week?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Dark soccer, how was your gaming week?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Uh.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
That good, huh?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Dan worked on the No Fear pinball today.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And it is in now fully playable condition.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And as soon as he finished up some last switch tweaks on it,

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
it will be good to go.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
And I helped by taking pictures of stuff.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
It's a pinball table, and I helped.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I, um, we also got, um, I don't know if I mentioned this last,

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
well, the week before.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
We got a Black Knight 2000 finally.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Nice.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And so the stickers for it arrived

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
because the play field's pretty trashed up right now.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
But, um, the only problem is that they gave us the

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Rung Magna Lock stickers so we have to get the right ones.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
And, um, I played more Ragnarok.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
And Dan's getting me the Iron Man game for Xbox 360.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
When's that out? Like next month?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It's already out.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh. I guess that makes sense.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Came out in time for the movie.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I haven't been video game shopping in a while.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I have enough games to hold me over.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm just gonna pretend that it's not dude, you know, playing him.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
It's not, what, Robert Downey Jr.?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
You're not a big Robert? I thought you loved the movie.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I do.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
But you just don't like him.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh, okay.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Whatever.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
But I'm gonna take you to see it.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I will. I will.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
We're going tomorrow.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I can do it tomorrow.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
We're going tomorrow.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I can do it tomorrow.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't know, cause, um,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, somebody's back in town tomorrow.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I gotta go hang with them.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
We'll go Wednesday.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Alright, we'll go this week.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
We will.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I still kinda wanna see Speed Racer

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
even though everything I've heard about it is terrible.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It's fucking awesome.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
A lot of people like it.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Did you see it, Loki?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
It was awesome.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Was it?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
See, now I heard that you wouldn't like Speed Racer

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
unless you're a seven-year-old boy.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I hate Speed Racer.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I absolutely hate the cartoon, and I like the movie.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
See, I like Speed Racer because it's done by Tatunoko Studios,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
and that's the place they gave us Gatchaman.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's, it's, it gets, let me put it this way,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
it's like, uh, Willy Wonka with cars.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
It's just really, it goes from varying levels of, like,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
what the hell, to, you know, it's pretty cool.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
There's a lot of stuff that they throw in there,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
you know, pretty awesome,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
and then there's a lot of stuff that they throw in just, you know,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
because it's a family movie.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I need to see Racer X.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Now, see, the reason why I kinda wanted to see Speed Racer

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
is it looks like F-Zero, the movie, which is kind of awesome.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Uh, not really, but it's cool.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I mean, it's cool in its own right.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
As long as the Mach 5 has all of its crap, I'm happy.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You know, that's the game they need to make.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I wanna see, like, a game like F-Zero,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
but on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Well, there was, uh, Fatal Inertia, but that was kinda, eh.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
I wanna see something just, like, that'll just blow my mind

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
with how great the graphics are and all that.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It was supposed to be blow-my-mind awesome,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
but it was blow-my-mind average.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So, I don't know.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
Anyways, uh, this week, I played a whole ton of Grand Theft Auto IV.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Just a whole ton of it.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Everything from the single player to, uh, multiplayer.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Did some ranked multiplayer.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm now level 2, and you can actually, um, you know,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
rank up, I think, all the way to level 10.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
So, I have a long ways to go there.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I like how they do it.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
It's basically just experience or, I guess, uh,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
money that you earn throughout the game.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So, you can play, you know, for quite a while.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
There's a few lag issues I ran into, but overall, it's pretty good.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Um, I just absolutely love that game.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
What can I say?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Um, other than Grand Theft Auto,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I did get to play a few other games today.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I played, uh, God of War Chains of Olympus,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
and that's pretty cool.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I played mainly the demo before,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
so it was nice to actually get to play the full game.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And, um, you know, if you like God of War,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
you're gonna love this game.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
It's absolutely amazing to see that they were able to put

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
a God of War game onto the PSP and not really sacrifice anything.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So, that was pretty cool.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Um, and then, of course, more Space Invaders Extreme,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and that game's just, you know, all sorts of awesome.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I've been trying this week to, um,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
get around to playing Speed Racer for the Wii,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
and especially after last night,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
it was funny because Nellie went and saw the movie with me,

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
and she's like,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Did they have a game for this?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm like,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, hold on, hold on.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Your wife, who hates games that aren't called Bejeweled or Zuma,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
wanted to go buy a video game.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
She likes Excite Truck.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh, yeah, I forgot she liked Excite Truck, too.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, she said that this would be perfect

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
if they had Excite Truck, but with those tracks,

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
she's like, that would be perfect.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm like, well, they have a game for it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm not sure if it's like Excite Truck.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm pretty sure it's not, but, you know, you can try it anyways.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
But does she like Mario Kart?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
She hasn't played Mario Kart yet.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I don't think she would.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
She loves Excite Truck.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Is your wife a fan of Monster Trucks or something?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
No, she just likes the gameplay of that,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
and I hope they announce a sequel,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
because that game needs a sequel.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Frisbee says Excite Truck should come down in price.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It should.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Has it not come down in price after all this time?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I don't think so.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Wow.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It's Excite Truck, so no.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Amazing.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
As far as I remember, it's not being sold anymore.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
All right, so anything else for your gaming week?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
That was it.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
I've been trying to get around to playing Trackmania United,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
so hopefully I'll get to play that this week.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
My gaming week.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I had a Wii Week, which is strange,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
because the Wii went unloved for months and months,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
and then like Brawl came out,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and I was playing that for a little while,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
and then Mario Kart came out, and I've been playing that,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
and I already talked about it last week.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I continue to play it this week, and I think,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
you know what, I think this is my favorite Mario Kart

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
since the original.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I think it really is.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Like, even though the online is, you know, janky,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
because Nintendo made it, and, you know,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
they don't nearly have the online competency

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
that, like, Microsoft has,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
the online does add a really fun element into it.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I've got to say, if you have your computer there,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
and you're able to network the friends together

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
to get the game online going,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
because just impromptu, last night,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I was on Justin.tv just randomly,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
because I had said I was going to do the

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
every extend extra extreme with Space Invaders music,

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
and somehow that turned into playing Mario Kart Wii

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
against four Orange Hans Radio listeners

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
who joined me for an online match,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
and it was a lot of fun.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I had a lot of fun playing Mario Kart online with them.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Of course, I won.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I made it even more fun.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
No, I lost battle mode, though.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
They whooped me in battle, but I won the race mode.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I don't like battle mode.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's not as cool as it used to be.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
The battle mode is not nearly as cool as it used to be,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
but the game, I'd consider versus mode like the game itself,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
and that's great.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I love the courses.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I love the new courses.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
They're all so good.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Still, I stand by not really caring for their selection

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
of retro courses that they brought back.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I would agree with you to a point.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The thing is that the GameCube one,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I didn't play a lot of,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
so I'm glad they brought some of those really good courses over,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
like the Volcano one.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's one of my favorite stages.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't think they call it Volcano,

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
because there's another Volcano,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
but it's like Donkey Kong's Jungle or something,

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
but it was the GameCube one.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
You get shot up this giant mountain,

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
and then you race down it.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I love that track.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
See, that's the thing.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
That was so similar to the snowboarding one.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
That was also a Donkey Kong-themed thing.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I don't know.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I really think that there was a few tracks in there

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
that they should have brought in.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Maybe had taken a vote or something.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
See, but here's the thing.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
If Nintendo was smart about their online strategy,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
they would have downloadable tracks,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
and they could do more retro stuff.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Yes, and that's a key phrase, if they were smart.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
But the thing is, they're not,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
and they're playing it way too damn safe,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
and there's not going to be downloadable content

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
available for these games for quite a while.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And there is one game,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
and that's coming up in the show role about download content.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I know that there's a service that they already unveiled it

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
or announced it,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
but it's not being implemented until the summer.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Well, here's the other weird thing,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
is that they've got another problem on that Wii to figure out,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
and that's the fact that I ran out of space on my Wii this week.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Now, granted, I've downloaded, like,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
craploads of virtual console games,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
because I'm a whore for retro games,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
and, you know, every channel they released,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and when I finally copied the Mario Kart channel,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
or I wanted to, or no, no,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I copied the Mario Kart channel,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
and then when that new channel came out this week

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
that we're going to talk about later,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I ran out of space.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I couldn't install it.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I had to go back and delete.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
So I've already filled up my Wii,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
and WiiWare's not even up yet.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So they've got a storage problem on top of everything.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't know how the hell I'm going to fit

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
download content on that thing.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Luckily, the WiiWare games aren't that large.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Like, under 48 megs.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I mean, I'm going to have to copy

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
the virtual console games to my card

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
and copy them over one on a player.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
It's just such a hassle.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Well...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
One little patch is all it would take

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
to use that SD card as a normal, like, memory.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Seriously.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Yep, and that's Nintendo, though, for you.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
If it works as a hassle patch, okay for us.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Just like the Friends codes.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It works, but it's a hassle.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, the man that, uh,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
precedes us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
when we tape live.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
He goes live at 5 o'clock Pacific.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
He's calling me out.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
He says, I would beat you, Sky.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Well, I see that challenge, Mr. Blackwolf.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
We'll set up a challenge this week at some point.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm actually not that great at Mario Kart.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I want to play.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, I'll play.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Hey, this can be the ChromeHounds event

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
that never was.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, I'm not that great at Mario Kart,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
but I'll play.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
We'll play. It'll be fun.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Alright, Bobby.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Let's set up a time.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Especially, you know, and that's another thing

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
that I don't really care about this Mario Kart,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
and the fact that, you know, the AI is retarded

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and the item selection's also retarded,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
because when you're up in the first place,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
you get nothing, and when you're in the last place,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
it's like, blue shell, blue shell, blue shell, blue shell.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
So...

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Blue shells need to die to fire.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Other Nintendo games I've been playing this week,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I picked up a game for $15 at Costco.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
It's the Williams Pinball Table Collection.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't think that's the actual name of the game.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I apologize, but it's...

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
You can't miss it.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
It's the pinball collection featuring

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
all the Williams tables.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
So not only did Dark Soccer have a pinball week,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
I did too, and I played the shit at a pinbot.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
That was awesome to get to play that again.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
And for the value, considering I only paid $15 for it,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
and I imagine it's $19.99 normally,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
because Costco, you know, marks everything down,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
it's not a bad deal at all.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
With all the tables you get in there,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
you have a lot of retro tables in there.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You know, when you consider the pinball FX

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
on Xbox Live is $10, and they're very similar,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
but in the case of the Wii 1, you get to play

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
kind of games you remember and love.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
It's kind of cool.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I got to tell you, the control scheme is kind of funny.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Like, funny in a good way.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
What you do, you use the Wii and the nunchuk,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I mean the Wiimote and the nunchuk.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And the trigger on the Wiimote is the right flipper,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and then the little trigger on the nunchuk

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
is the left flipper.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So, actually, you were, like, pulling little triggers

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
to move the flippers.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
It's kind of cute.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
And then the little controller thingy

13:08.000 --> 13:16.320
thingy on the nunchuck is the thing that you pull back to launch the ball.

13:16.320 --> 13:22.440
So it's kind of neat and it's interesting because they built achievements into the game

13:22.440 --> 13:23.440
which I think is interesting.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.880
Like if you get a thousand points or I mean a hundred thousand points on this table then

13:27.880 --> 13:32.600
you get a credit to play the tournament games which I thought was kind of cute.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
So they thought a waste.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.860
I think it's good that they have that on the analog just because there's like for example

13:36.860 --> 13:42.360
pinball like you were saying has the spiral on it to where it's not the very top one it's

13:42.360 --> 13:44.800
like the second to last one gives you more points.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.800
Right skill shots.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
Yeah.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.400
Tons of pinball games have skill shots so the older ones not so much it was just kind

13:49.400 --> 13:52.800
of about which shoot would it go down to but yeah pinball and some of the other later ones

13:52.800 --> 13:54.920
but it's got some great tables in it.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.840
A whirlwind remember that one that one was fun where the thing we almost bought a whirlwind

13:58.840 --> 14:02.360
oh but the the good thing about whirlwind though is that you actually want to have the

14:02.360 --> 14:06.600
real table for that so that when you go inside after being outside all day yes it blows the

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
wind at you.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
I know.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
And fortunately the Wii doesn't do that.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.600
Sad.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
But it was good times.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
So.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
So what else was all on that collection?

14:13.600 --> 14:19.680
Oh gosh I got I Black Knight I know was there Taxi AJ Mixx is pointing out in chat I guess

14:19.680 --> 14:26.520
they looked it up let's see actually actdeft is linking me to a page that has more information

14:26.520 --> 14:30.200
about the game because I'm too lazy to go grab my copy of the game it has some really

14:30.200 --> 14:35.520
old tables in it too like what is the one there's almost like a giant Satan on it that's

14:35.520 --> 14:39.920
a very there's it's a very early early table on it as long as it doesn't have hyper ball

14:39.920 --> 14:40.920
then I'm okay.

14:40.920 --> 14:46.080
Gorgar the first ever talking pinball machine that's the one with like Satan on it Space

14:46.080 --> 14:51.960
Shuttle is on there too yeah I'm looking at the list good times so let's see which of

14:51.960 --> 14:59.000
these I own no I'm kidding but seriously for the value it's a great value you know especially

14:59.000 --> 15:03.640
when you consider there's a very comparable game where the tables aren't quite as memorable

15:03.640 --> 15:08.120
I mean don't get me wrong I like pinball FX but it's not quite as memorable as some of

15:08.120 --> 15:12.840
these tables I mean they're classic tables for a reason so no sadly the Tommy table is

15:12.840 --> 15:17.880
not in the game DJ Dark Knight so the Tommy table is freaking awesome if you like pinball

15:17.880 --> 15:22.080
at all it's worth the money to get this for the Wii it's fun that's that's my thoughts

15:22.080 --> 15:26.720
it was the big thing about Black Knight the Magna save mm-hmm mm-hmm they sent us the

15:26.720 --> 15:32.740
wrong Magna save stickers alright so that's gonna do it for my gaming week because otherwise

15:32.740 --> 15:36.680

17:18.600 --> 17:23.880

17:23.880 --> 17:28.760
collection I hate that game fun house is cool shut up stupid head all right we'll give you

17:28.760 --> 17:35.520
more details on the game in part B when we play the game and let's see that's it otherwise

17:35.520 --> 17:40.920
we always have our myspace at orange lounge radio on myspace our live journal community

17:40.920 --> 17:47.680
is orange lounge no radio we're also on Facebook just search for olr me olr my all right gaming

17:47.680 --> 17:55.480
news we had a lot this week take it away Loki yes of course as Rob was mentioning when he

17:55.480 --> 18:01.240
tried to install the Nintendo channel his Wii said no you're out of space but I the

18:01.240 --> 18:06.720
Nintendo channel or as it's known in Japan everybody's a Nintendo channel fuck that's

18:06.720 --> 18:14.520
my Nintendo channel now is available on the Wii I will allow you to rate different games

18:14.520 --> 18:20.760
include I think we we were games virtual console and full Wii games after you played them for

18:20.760 --> 18:24.840
an hour as well as there's gonna be some I think video that you can watch of different

18:24.840 --> 18:29.580
games I think the coolest thing though that you'll probably see though available for it

18:29.580 --> 18:35.340
is DS demo downloads which is pretty awesome and you can stream those to your DS just like

18:35.340 --> 18:43.180
a you know download station so go check it out it's absolutely free and who doesn't like

18:43.180 --> 18:49.960
demos free if you sell your soul to Nintendo yes yes because you have to agree that the

18:49.960 --> 18:54.880
thing will I don't know monitor what the hell to do it's sending like anonymous you should

18:54.880 --> 18:58.920
jet usage data about the games you've been playing so like you know you know how the

18:58.920 --> 19:02.760
weeds been secretly compiling the amount of time you can go to that note in your board

19:02.760 --> 19:05.920
you can see how long you've been playing the games well that information gets sent to Nintendo

19:05.920 --> 19:12.080
and in turn you get the list of DS games like you don't do it no games no DS demos for you

19:12.080 --> 19:16.640
I mean I don't know like I'm not too worried about it I gladly clicked yes I mean I don't

19:16.640 --> 19:22.440
care I mean seriously what is Nintendo gonna do knowing that some you know Shmo in Sacramento

19:22.440 --> 19:27.640
California it was playing way too much and I know that I like your site truck and then

19:27.640 --> 19:31.900
we'll go hey people like excite truck let's make another one and that's not a bad thing

19:31.900 --> 19:35.440
I think it's fairly smart of them to have something like that enacted it's a good way

19:35.440 --> 19:43.280
to I think it's a good non intrusive way I think to for market research exactly this

19:43.280 --> 19:48.160
isn't like EA where it's like hey we've got your credit card number we want to know what

19:48.160 --> 19:51.600
you're buying true I don't think Nintendo saves your credit card information you have

19:51.600 --> 19:57.960
to input it every freaking time you know so once again you know it works but it's an inconvenience

19:57.960 --> 20:03.560
you know so what did you did you actually check out the channel I checked out the channel

20:03.560 --> 20:08.000
not download it didn't even plug it in too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 4 I did download

20:08.000 --> 20:13.280
it and it wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped they have some videos on there which is kind

20:13.280 --> 20:18.120
of interesting to see on the Wii isn't that just a recurring theme with the Wii wasn't

20:18.120 --> 20:24.720
quite as cool as I had hoped no I don't know it just you know I do think the concept of

20:24.720 --> 20:29.160
turning it into a DS demo station that was kind of cool because it was cool like I downloaded

20:29.160 --> 20:34.020
the brain H2 jump demo just for the hell of it okay seriously it was interesting yes I'm

20:34.020 --> 20:38.520
glad it's it's an interesting thing it's also something they talked about III prior to the

20:38.520 --> 20:42.680
we launching that this was already supposed to have happened at launch what's taking them

20:42.680 --> 20:48.400
so long I mean seriously what is taking them so long to implement this crap it's like oh

20:48.400 --> 20:53.320
well eventually we'll get a unified you know online service and stuff oh great I'm glad

20:53.320 --> 20:59.040
that you're catching up to Microsoft it'll only be a few years now well maybe they just

20:59.040 --> 21:02.160
had some fine-tuning to do or something or maybe they just kind of rushed the we out

21:02.160 --> 21:06.120
there and now they you know there's only so many people that work there the people are

21:06.120 --> 21:10.880
interested in online what are they talking about Xbox Live statistics are bullshit they're

21:10.880 --> 21:17.620
pulling out of their ass with all right I'm looking at chat here act F says I like the

21:17.620 --> 21:22.320
channel I like the demos AJ mix says demos is pretty much the high point and it has the

21:22.320 --> 21:31.240
commercial that has the kid that says I am mudkip I miss that I have to go back and look

21:31.240 --> 21:35.680
I mean I was thinking like wow be kind of cool if there was like a YouTube is channel

21:35.680 --> 21:39.560
or cute little viral things could be on there but then I'm thinking oh but there's the internet

21:39.560 --> 21:45.600
channel so I could just go to YouTube on the internet channel why bother and then four

21:45.600 --> 21:53.680
hours later you'll be able to watch the latest viral videos exactly all right other stuff

21:53.680 --> 21:59.200
going on in the Wii world and a lot of fanboys including myself have been eagerly anticipating

21:59.200 --> 22:05.380
the release someday of Kid Icarus on the Wii and here's the thing is that it may have actually

22:05.380 --> 22:11.360
been spoiled this week by IGN you know that guy over at IGN who's you know him he's like

22:11.360 --> 22:15.680
the quintessential Nintendo fanboy not that that's an issue but he's just is Matt Casa

22:15.680 --> 22:21.260
Casa mass enough that as they say his name Casa role Casa Massena all right he probably

22:21.260 --> 22:27.860
heard that like a million times in the third grade Loki come on all right so this guy he

22:27.860 --> 22:33.600
was in the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast first off Nintendo has voice chat that's amazing

22:33.600 --> 22:42.140
they name all their podcasts after stuff like they have was it the I want to say ring red

22:42.140 --> 22:48.360
ring of death is their Xbox 360 podcast nice oh I see so they make one they make fun of

22:48.360 --> 22:53.100
the system in their name like you know and then the PlayStation 3 crayon eating cast

22:53.100 --> 22:57.560
I don't know all right fine whatever the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast he says in this

22:57.560 --> 23:03.160
of course Nintendo is gonna have some e3 surprises you know Kid Icarus for crying out loud how

23:03.160 --> 23:08.760
many times we have to say it it's coming out for crying out loud so you know and you kind

23:08.760 --> 23:11.920
of think this guy might kind of know something going on on the inside because usually you

23:11.920 --> 23:16.680
know these really big gaming sites are kind of in on what's the no it really wouldn't

23:16.680 --> 23:21.460
suppose there's been little breadcrumb clues to that this is gonna happen a he showed up

23:21.460 --> 23:26.320
in brawl that should be a big clue right there I honestly think that's a clue and we heard

23:26.320 --> 23:32.680
that what was it Factor five I think was developing an unknown game that was suspected to be this

23:32.680 --> 23:39.080
so and then I guess on the next show the same guy he actually said Kid Icarus that's another

23:39.080 --> 23:42.620
one I'm really anticipating just because I love the franchise and I'm sure the developer

23:42.620 --> 23:48.400
will make a really pretty game so he said it twice that it's coming so it is maybe if

23:48.400 --> 23:53.400
I keep seeing stuff it'll come to some things say they're coming and never do so all right

23:53.400 --> 24:00.080
well I can't I can't wait for I cannot wait for compile to reform and have a booth at

24:00.080 --> 24:03.880
E3 this year and announce Guardian Legend 2 I can't wait for that that's that's going

24:03.880 --> 24:08.000
to be the show right there was a Guardian Legend 2 so we want Guardian Legend 3 what

24:08.000 --> 24:12.360
was Guardian Legend 2 the Guardian Legend that we got over here in the US oh oh yeah

24:12.360 --> 24:18.720
first one was Guardic or whatever so just let you know just get together and make a

24:18.720 --> 24:25.040
new game that is like Zelda plus shooter and that would be awesome all right and let's

24:25.040 --> 24:29.360
see what now something that didn't make our little list but I know I saw it on the internet

24:29.360 --> 24:33.420
there was like some concept artwork that supposedly leaked although I don't know some of it kind

24:33.420 --> 24:37.880
of screamed fanboy to me no it was actually it was stuff that they're it was a company

24:37.880 --> 24:44.760
pitching the idea of a Kid Icarus game they set up a bunch of different shots hmm but

24:44.760 --> 24:48.880
like it was weird because if you've seen the shots pit looks all like buff well they have

24:48.880 --> 24:53.920
a bunch of different styles of shots and stuff so it's not just that super buff one that

24:53.920 --> 25:03.200
you're seeing and it was from a website come combo with K mm-hmm and I guess not to be

25:03.200 --> 25:10.240
confused with zombo there was another website that had some stuff but uh they said that

25:10.240 --> 25:15.160
I guess it was supposedly from Factor 5 where those pieces are working and they have a but

25:15.160 --> 25:20.480
like I said a bunch of different shots there's some that look really realistic there's one

25:20.480 --> 25:26.960
that looks like a really shitty cartoon there's some emo shots something that looks like it

25:26.960 --> 25:31.440
might been out of like Kingdom Hearts you know just like a whole bunch of stuff but

25:31.440 --> 25:37.780
yeah some of it looks a little bit fanboyish but it's slowly a fact that the Kid Icarus

25:37.780 --> 25:43.000
game would be coming to we in the first place is a little fanboyish don't you think it is

25:43.000 --> 25:46.960
I hey I will be first in line to pre-order and then thusly buy this game well because

25:46.960 --> 25:51.160
I love the original 8-bit that much well you know since they have the characters from mother

25:51.160 --> 25:57.880
in there maybe mother threes coming here haha no why you gotta why you gotta be a dick yeah

25:57.880 --> 26:02.720
I'm not the one that's saying hey let's localize a game for Europe and I'll bring it to the

26:02.720 --> 26:10.840
US all right let's move on with some more stories import time FTW anywho um for those

26:10.840 --> 26:17.320
who have been waiting for WiiWare we have a bit of a release from Nintendo giving us some ideas

26:17.320 --> 26:22.120
that are going of what's definitely going to be out for the launch of WiiWare and if you are ready

26:22.120 --> 26:32.440
I has them okay defender castle will be 500 we points pop for 700 we points VIP casino blackjack

26:32.440 --> 26:40.240
for 700 TV show king for a thousand whatever what TV show I think that's a trivia game for a

26:40.240 --> 26:46.360
thousand point defending now I like to fend your castle and that's 500 points in a TV show King

26:46.360 --> 26:52.800
all right they're gonna be like seen it lost wins for a thousand I like it pretty good and

26:52.800 --> 26:58.200
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles my life as a king for 15 that I'm not too sure if it looked

26:58.200 --> 27:04.040
good or not I'm not buying that at a protest there's no dr. Mario I thought dr. Mario got

27:04.040 --> 27:11.200
what was like a late add to the list or something yeah it's coming I need to throw pills at by right

27:11.200 --> 27:19.640
and you could do it on the internet yes we'll be fun another game not coming to WiiWare but

27:19.640 --> 27:27.840
coming to the Wii and this is a pretty interesting rumor apparently there are a couple links coming

27:27.840 --> 27:36.840
from I guess some Brazilian sites the first one talking a little bit about Castlevania for the

27:36.840 --> 27:43.800
Wii a second link also coming from another Brazilian site apparently has some I guess

27:43.800 --> 27:51.600
quotes from Shinji Harano and the executive VP for Konami USA stating that a Castlevania titles

27:51.600 --> 27:58.640
were headed to the Wii and DS he says that we'll learn more information about these titles come

27:58.640 --> 28:06.080
next week when Konami is holding a press event in the US god damn it where's my invite for this shit

28:06.080 --> 28:12.280
seriously now they promised us that when a Castlevania game was going to be coming that

28:12.280 --> 28:15.880
you would not actually have to use the Wii mode as a whip right because that would be the most

28:15.880 --> 28:24.480
hokey thing ever yeah it doesn't really say anything about that though but I if I were to

28:24.480 --> 28:32.320
guess I would say you probably use the Wii mode as a whip all right anyhow moving on to other

28:32.320 --> 28:37.520
Nintendo news Wii Fit we still don't have this game in the US but it's come out in Japan it's

28:37.520 --> 28:42.840
come out in the UK see now this is Nintendo playing a little game with us called here's

28:42.840 --> 28:50.240
what the UK feels like all the time with this game oh darn I can't get Wii Fit so sad oh well

28:50.240 --> 28:54.760
least I had brawl early and some you know Mario Kart and we're really sure you don't need Wii Fit

28:54.760 --> 29:00.920
I'm pretty sure you sure you already bought Wii Fit okay so shut up that's with you I have

29:00.920 --> 29:07.640
Wii Fit it's on order it's paid for I just wait all right rare that roughly your feathers there

29:07.640 --> 29:13.680
lucky all right so here's the thing is that Wii Fit is already causing a little bit of controversy

29:13.680 --> 29:19.920
okay here's the thing is that there's this poster and the poster post on this website the DIS boards

29:19.920 --> 29:26.440
and this is what they said that the Wii Fit basically crushed one girl's dreams this is it

29:26.440 --> 29:31.320
quote my relative came around this weekend and we let her play on our Wii Fit we've all laughed

29:31.320 --> 29:36.020
and joked about being told that we're fat and need to lose weight but I was gobsmacked when

29:36.020 --> 29:41.960
it told her that she is overweight apparently it was this ten-year-old girl who is four foot

29:41.960 --> 29:47.760
nine and she weighs six stone that's you know healthy all right and apparently we we judgment

29:47.760 --> 29:53.360
called her overweight and the girl was really upset and they had to kind of like calm her down

29:53.360 --> 29:57.920
and the quote continues I know it's just a game but seriously we already have to worry about young

29:57.920 --> 30:02.080
girls starving themselves to look like magazine models and now we have a game that tells them

30:02.080 --> 30:10.120
they're fat is this is this gonna be a problem when this game comes out over here question who

30:10.120 --> 30:17.640
actually uses the weight measurement of stone in Europe that's retarded she weighs 84 pounds okay

30:17.640 --> 30:24.720
yeah and she was so upset about being called fat she ate the board for not for nine and being 84

30:24.720 --> 30:30.880
pounds that's not really no it's not it you know it is unfortunate and for being 10 years old yeah

30:30.880 --> 30:35.560
you have to remember though it is just a game I mean I kind of compare this to the fact that

30:35.560 --> 30:41.880
in brain training like when you try to say blue it doesn't pick it up you go blue blue and it doesn't

30:41.880 --> 30:47.480
listen to you and you go brew and it listens to you you know what I'm not a lot of starving

30:47.480 --> 30:51.720
herself in order to become a model you know nowadays it's a competitive market out there

30:51.720 --> 30:57.160
and just a fit is telling the truth actually they've actually been sort of showing a trend

30:57.160 --> 31:02.440
lately now where the super skinny you know rail thin model is no longer being considered

31:02.440 --> 31:07.480
attractive by a lot of companies that's all right I know what I get we fit it's not gonna say I'm

31:07.480 --> 31:16.680
overweight it's gonna say get off me being thin causes cancer haven't you heard that is the new

31:16.680 --> 31:21.380
thing actually they actually um there's plenty of studies showing right now and by the way her BMI

31:21.380 --> 31:28.640
is only 18.2 which also BMI is bullshit it was created by somebody in the 1800s to do a study

31:28.640 --> 31:38.720
of body masses in Poland I'm not joking so anyway anyway um the the whole thing now is that they're

31:38.720 --> 31:43.700
actually the studies are out there saying that it's better to be quote overweight and active

31:43.700 --> 31:52.560
than be rail thin and inactive gs68 says love handles greater than exposed ribs oh hell yeah

31:52.560 --> 31:57.440
I mean you gotta have something to grab on to you know I don't want to you know I wouldn't want to

31:57.440 --> 32:02.640
date some guy that I had to you know if I grabbed a hold of him I'd like poke a hole through my hand

32:02.640 --> 32:12.160
by his hip bone or ow I know I think sorry skeletons aren't sexy skeletons belong in a

32:12.160 --> 32:16.720
grave and I always pronounce mispronounce his name in chat I apologize I'm Hippolytus says

32:16.720 --> 32:21.240
brain training 2 has no blue well that's good that might make the sequel worth it alone cuz

32:21.240 --> 32:26.560
I'll tell you that blue thing was very frustrating but alright so hopefully I don't know maybe

32:26.560 --> 32:31.360
they're tweaking the game so that it doesn't you know tell people they're overweight over

32:31.360 --> 32:36.600
here cuz I'll tell you what there's a lot of Americans who are like pussies and and they're

32:36.600 --> 32:42.080
gonna really be upset if you think one ten-year-old girls all you got over there it's awesome they

32:42.080 --> 32:52.760
spent $100 on this game and then they go home and cry oh really yeah I took the game to tell you

32:52.760 --> 32:56.800
that so this is what you need it so listeners and everybody that's gonna be buying this game

32:56.800 --> 33:02.880
here in America this is your this is your chance to practice your attitude okay cuz you know you

33:02.880 --> 33:07.520
got to have attitude so here's the thing is that when the game tells you that you're fat you go I

33:07.520 --> 33:14.080
am and that's more of me to love you just have to yell back at the game now the whole the whole

33:14.080 --> 33:20.320
point is just you know to just get out and do something that's the whole reason why I think

33:20.320 --> 33:28.200
that we fit exists is just so that you're not sitting around playing a game you're up and doing

33:28.200 --> 33:35.480
something I think I think that it doesn't matter what a game that is not that first of all does not

33:35.480 --> 33:42.400
see what you look like does not know who you are has no concept of what your life is like giving

33:42.400 --> 33:48.000
you a judgment based off of arbitrary information that has been entered into its programming to

33:48.000 --> 33:55.080
judge you by this is called you know what suck it up that's what it's called or to quote Dennis

33:55.080 --> 34:02.280
Leary shut the fuck up we need a sequel called we fat that's specifically for like you know fat

34:02.280 --> 34:07.760
and fabulous people that should be that should be like the sequel well at the point of the game is

34:07.760 --> 34:14.040
just to get up and do something no and then in seriously are seriously that's kind of been I

34:14.040 --> 34:20.720
mean that's why the we has sold gazillions of consoles as it is and we sports is because we

34:20.720 --> 34:26.440
has that persona of oh it's a video game but you get up and you do things and you play I mean come

34:26.440 --> 34:32.240
on you that's what I don't when I'm playing it look I'm not talking about you or necessarily the

34:32.240 --> 34:36.880
hardcore gamers I'm talking about the soccer mom of the world their perception of this when they

34:36.880 --> 34:41.920
see it on TV and they see it at friends houses at parties and things they see people up and they see

34:41.920 --> 34:48.280
kids jumping around and swinging the tennis racket or believing they are whatever I've really actually

34:48.280 --> 34:53.880
I'm kind of been enjoying this trend from Nintendo lately where their games aren't just about fun

34:53.880 --> 34:59.800
they're about fun plus improvement it's cut yeah it's kind of like brain training mm-hmm or you

34:59.800 --> 35:06.480
know we've got our Wii games that get us up and moving Konami has had their similar games too I

35:06.480 --> 35:11.360
think it's more or less there's been all this complaining about oh video games you know rot

35:11.360 --> 35:16.360
your mind and you know you sit on the couch and don't do anything and blah blah blah blah blah

35:16.360 --> 35:23.560
but now they're making doing something exercising your intelligence working your brain working your

35:23.560 --> 35:29.440
body they're making it fun I don't think so I think this is the whole it's basically they're

35:29.440 --> 35:33.960
following the money they're trying to figure out what gimmicky things they can do to get people

35:33.960 --> 35:39.600
that normally play games to play these things and buy them I mean that's why they're focusing on the

35:39.600 --> 35:44.880
brain training stuff because people think oh it'll make me smarter I I need I need to be smarter

35:44.880 --> 35:50.120
because smarter is good and then you know the whole like Mario Kart and that stupid wheel

35:50.120 --> 35:55.280
attachment oh well that's pretty neat let me get that game it's like I'm driving a real car except

35:55.280 --> 36:00.600
you're not and then you know just like the Wii Fit oh make me I'll make me all fit I cuz you know

36:00.600 --> 36:05.320
I could use a good workout and then they'll come out with something else that's retarded and people

36:05.320 --> 36:09.560
will buy it too and that's their target audience they don't give a shit about improving anybody

36:09.560 --> 36:13.880
all they care about is improving the amount of people that use their system and buy their

36:13.880 --> 36:22.600
products that is it I thought that we fit looked kind of fun I I'm gonna buy it I got the whole

36:22.600 --> 36:26.240
reason that I would want to play it is just because it looks fun and I like doing active

36:26.240 --> 36:31.320
things I I have to admit that's kind of the reason why I'm gonna get it too is that yeah it will kind

36:31.320 --> 36:36.120
of get me off the couch how long it will last though that's the question I want to still want

36:36.120 --> 36:42.280
to reenact DD overnight comments in chat Hippolytus says brain age tells you you're dumb we fit tells

36:42.280 --> 36:48.560
you you're fat Gerardo mo says both of them together tell you you're fat and dumb and Nintendo

36:48.560 --> 36:56.160
is about demoralization apparently so hey quilt hippo says can we have soul training please they

36:56.160 --> 37:02.480
should they should have we we morals there's something like that wheel of morality turn turn

37:02.480 --> 37:08.880
turn show us the lesson that we should learn that's the lesson is that's the game they need on we

37:08.880 --> 37:14.720
they need some type of moral moral lesson game and every kid in America should play already we

37:14.720 --> 37:19.360
already get other people's moral shot on our throat every time your game's doing it well I

37:19.360 --> 37:25.040
forgot to mention um I think this week too I know it wasn't on that launch list but I'm pretty

37:25.040 --> 37:29.560
positive that it's one of the we wear launch titles remember there's also the major league

37:29.560 --> 37:36.980
eating game that comes out as well so you know got a game for the fat people got a game for the

37:36.980 --> 37:41.480
people that don't want to be fat anymore oh my gosh I'm looking at Justin TV chat and one of our

37:41.480 --> 37:49.320
listeners in Japan Akuma JP says they do have we moral there it's Japanese tradition training

37:49.320 --> 37:55.800
they actually do have a game like that in Japan that's great of a cultural and that's all it needs

37:55.800 --> 37:59.360
to be here too I don't think they should have morals down throat but they should you know have

37:59.360 --> 38:09.800
you know common sense type things you know like you know sense don't call people ugly names good

38:09.800 --> 38:16.680

40:01.040 --> 40:06.760
turbo graphics version on top of that you never know it's Joe I Nikki is like crack tacular you

40:06.760 --> 40:10.760

their butts and not now and I need to play some we ethics and not even the good vibrating kind

40:17.280 --> 40:28.240
because it'd be a little that'd be a little bit less okay quick next story there's well

40:28.240 --> 40:34.960
well tippos readying his man beam says ready your man beam Tony oh sorry well there's this

40:34.960 --> 40:40.360
company that's matrix software you may not know them by their you know company name but you know

40:40.360 --> 40:46.080
them from their games they have done the Final Fantasy 3 remake for the DS and are working on

40:46.080 --> 40:53.120
the Final Fantasy 4 remake for the DS well now they're working on their own game as well called

40:53.120 --> 41:03.560
Alundra and are I hell with that Alundra it was a fun RPG yes it was originally I guess released

41:03.560 --> 41:11.120
on the US on the PlayStation by working designs and wait that's just remake of another game then

41:11.120 --> 41:19.040
that's not even a new game well whatever anyways art was done by Toriyama it says the latest

41:19.040 --> 41:27.520
project I guess is another original piece this time from marvelous and it's called Avalon code

41:27.520 --> 41:34.160
is the new game I guess because they did the London for the PlayStation and Avalon code it

41:34.160 --> 41:39.080
doesn't really say what it is but of course it's gonna be kind of done in the similar style as you

41:39.080 --> 41:43.200
know the Final Fantasy remakes you know kind of a 3d type of game they said with the art style

41:43.200 --> 41:48.920
similar to Crystal Chronicles so yeah not Alundra they're not doing a new Alundra game but Avalon

41:48.920 --> 41:57.720
code is a new game it looks spiffy so we're not getting a London no no London that they did they

41:57.720 --> 42:04.200
originally I guess developed a London for the PlayStation but they're not okay I get it now

42:04.200 --> 42:13.360
my my mistake well new DS colors abound and in the US it was just a matter of time before this

42:13.360 --> 42:18.680
color made its way over here it is it's a rumor right now though it's coming from some GameStop

42:18.680 --> 42:28.520
insiders so what if the color is metallic rose is supposed to be coming over here that is absolutely

42:28.520 --> 42:33.680
the first time I've ever heard of that really absolutely first absolutely first time pretty

42:33.680 --> 42:44.720
sure this has never been mentioned on the show before right never also over in Germany some

42:44.720 --> 42:49.680
German retailers have also listed some other DS light colors that are supposed to be coming out

42:49.680 --> 42:56.120
in Europe and that is light blue red and green and they all come with matching stylus colors and you

42:56.120 --> 43:01.600
know with the metallic rose being such a pink girly color mm-hmm I wouldn't be surprised if

43:01.600 --> 43:06.360
they maybe I don't know got rid of pink or something hmm yeah so like they might be good

43:06.360 --> 43:10.840
to get rid of pink all together yeah that maybe cuz you know I mean what's the point I mean there's

43:10.840 --> 43:15.520
not that many girls out there that need a new system and metallic rose that's just that'll do

43:15.520 --> 43:19.920
just fine I agree it will there be a comparable boy color coming out to you I don't I don't know

43:19.920 --> 43:24.600
about that I mean cuz you've got black and white it takes a real man to enjoy pink I know I want

43:24.600 --> 43:35.040
metallic rose metallic rose now sans you know was it nintendo screening your color I want hmm I want

43:35.040 --> 43:41.600
death metal black Gerardo mo once sparkle in our chat room I'll be great I like sparkles I want

43:41.600 --> 43:48.320
death metal black like chrome no I want like red black how about see through have red black they

43:48.320 --> 43:53.200
do have red black I like the dark dark dark dark dark red that like look like you're looking to

43:53.200 --> 44:00.240
obsidian get a red get a red black DS and set it far away you know I could get a dark black DS and

44:00.240 --> 44:04.760
then use like transparent red paint on it and customize it myself you could I like customize

44:04.760 --> 44:08.760
my DS you know if you go to the Nintendo store they sell those custom DS as you can get in all

44:08.760 --> 44:13.400
those different colors I almost I would like so million I came so close to buying one because I

44:13.400 --> 44:20.040
am a consumer and how maybe that's all spend my stimulus check on I'll fly to New York and buy

44:20.040 --> 44:25.720
one of those DS's I'm just gonna customize my own I'll make my own skins I'm not really gonna do

44:25.720 --> 44:31.720
that by the way all right let's get to some Rob I am crazy let's get to some release dates we'll

44:31.720 --> 44:39.120
start off in the UK Jamie sweet release dates we have on the 14th assault heroes 2 on Xbox 360 on

44:39.120 --> 44:49.200
the 16th is the rest of these we have de blob on we have dream pinball per PC and for we Iron Man

44:49.200 --> 44:57.480
on PC Perry Rodan on PC whatever that is Silent Hill origins on PlayStation 2 and you all have

44:57.480 --> 45:04.240
to get it now or at least on the 16th and then supreme ruler 2020 which is a game about me I

45:04.240 --> 45:10.680
think dark soccer I think dark soccer should do like commercials for gaming companies you know

45:10.680 --> 45:16.400
de blob look pretty good they're kind of comparing it to like a katamari tip game hmm just with paint

45:16.400 --> 45:25.440
I'd have to see a demo it looked cool look cool in the US there's not a whole lot coming out of

45:25.440 --> 45:29.940
this week I guess it would be an exciting week if you liked I don't know Chronicle and Narnia

45:29.940 --> 45:34.600
Prince Caspian because there's a few games coming out for that well I wouldn't have to do with the

45:34.600 --> 45:40.980
movie coming out this weekend or maybe yeah yeah 360 DS PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 I believe the

45:40.980 --> 45:47.520
Wii version is coming out next week for some reason this week though we've also got castle

45:47.520 --> 45:53.760
of shikigami 3 if you like your really crazy shooter games you know kind of similar like

45:53.760 --> 46:02.240
Ikaruga that's probably worth the $29.99 deca sports which we showed off on this show here a

46:02.240 --> 46:08.520
little bit that's coming out this week as well also another $29.99 pretty cheap there we ski

46:08.520 --> 46:15.120
also another $30 game that's supposed to be pretty fun little skiing game also supporting

46:15.120 --> 46:23.600
the Wii balance boards so you can lean on that that's kind of cool drone tactics for the DS kind

46:23.600 --> 46:32.440
of a weird mechanical insect tactical game from Atlas and then we've got missed for the DS which

46:32.440 --> 46:41.480
you know just missed and you know it's it's just missed it's just missed yeah and I believe that's

46:41.480 --> 46:46.680
pretty much it I think for this week remember that hilarious theme song the deca sports game

46:46.680 --> 46:53.040
had oh my god we need to get that that's funny that's in our Justin TV archive by the way if you

46:53.040 --> 46:57.000
go to a Justin TV and you get back in the archive you can find that that was the best part about

46:57.000 --> 47:01.120
that game was the really weird theme song that they had the game was kind of fun it was like

47:01.120 --> 47:08.480
Wii Sports it's almost like a Wii Sports 2 in a way almost it's like a fun little party game

47:08.480 --> 47:14.520
doesn't have that Nintendo touch I can't explain it but you know see well Nintendo just doesn't

47:14.520 --> 47:22.800
have you know the really cool cheesy theme song so all right let's move over to Japan and look at

47:22.800 --> 47:28.560
what kind of releases are coming out over in Japan not a ton of stuff this week but better

47:28.560 --> 47:33.800
than last week we're like nothing came out the darkness makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week

47:33.800 --> 47:39.880
that's really the only big release on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 not a lot for you this week

47:39.880 --> 47:45.280
although there's a couple things next week but I'll tell you about those next week coming out on

47:45.280 --> 47:53.120
the Nintendo Wii Totsugeki Famicom Wars versus you might know that as Battalion Wars 2 that is

47:53.120 --> 47:57.440
coming out on the Nintendo Wii and it's not price reduction because I thought they had that way

47:57.440 --> 48:04.760
before us um no they want if you want to import it it's gonna cost you 65 bucks so I don't think

48:04.760 --> 48:08.480
that's a price reduction huh I thought they had that a long time ago you know it's weird Japan

48:08.480 --> 48:13.180
has been getting some releases like kind of maybe they're like releasing them or something

48:13.180 --> 48:23.600
perhaps on the PlayStation 2 always Shiro is coming out and that also is getting a limited

48:23.600 --> 48:28.160
edition version coming out it is let's see what this game looks like it looks like some type of

48:28.160 --> 48:36.460
RPG I'm thinking no I don't know it has a little cutscenes that based on anime there's no actual

48:36.460 --> 48:41.560
game screens I can find just cutscene I'm gonna guess it's a dating maybe it's a dating sim when

48:41.560 --> 48:45.280
in doubt dating sim no it's an it's some type of adventure game that's the category it falls into

48:45.280 --> 48:53.600
okay let's see also coming out a slaughter up core 10 mock go go go to that is and that's

48:53.600 --> 49:03.440
slaughter SLO tter not like murder with a pickaxe that is speed racer it looks like because it has

49:03.440 --> 49:12.920
the guy from speed racer on the cover yeah classic racer so some type of game oh god it's like a slot

49:12.920 --> 49:18.640
machine game that has a good slide and speed eraser how lame it looks like you unlock clips

49:18.640 --> 49:24.360
from speed racer as you play the slot machine well my hopes for that game went way down fast

49:24.360 --> 49:32.280
I was gonna mention also this week on Xbox live arcade we're getting assault heroes 2 nice which

49:32.280 --> 49:42.640
look okay the first one's alright and rocket man it came from Uranus that's on a 360 or Xbox live

49:42.640 --> 49:49.920
arcade and the PlayStation Network this week so mature we are here at orange launch radio yeah

49:49.920 --> 49:55.800
if you have rockets coming out Uranus you might have a problem rocket man it came from Uranus

49:55.800 --> 50:06.720
coming out on the Nintendo DS dungeon of wind aria luminous art 2 and mahjong navi ds yet another

50:06.720 --> 50:11.280
mahjong title because you just can't have enough mahjong let's see if there's anything on the PSP

50:11.280 --> 50:20.640
yeah bleach heat the soul 5 comes out before the Sony PSP so check that out those are your

50:20.640 --> 50:30.160
Japanese release dates for this week May 15th and good for them good for them well here's some

50:30.160 --> 50:37.480
very interesting yet fun news for us is that burnout paradise is going to have a PC release

50:37.480 --> 50:47.200
and criterion said okay here so they're going to be actually rebuilding it so that it works pretty

50:47.200 --> 50:53.560
well on PC they're in enhancing multiplayer they're doing community content online features

50:53.560 --> 51:04.200
and resolution is at night 1920 by 2400 and is pretty much straight from the original I'm kind

51:04.200 --> 51:14.000
of curious what community features is going to entail sex somehow doubt that sex somebody break

51:14.000 --> 51:22.840
dark soccer this week what is up I guess all right well that that should be interesting see the sick

51:22.840 --> 51:27.520
thing is now I'm actually picturing that like how would that work in burnout paradise I don't know

51:27.520 --> 51:34.040
brings a whole new meaning to take me down to Paradise City so that could be interesting

51:34.040 --> 51:38.800
although I gotta say like you really are gonna have to have either some type of joystick with

51:38.800 --> 51:43.480
analog control or like a wheel for your PC to enjoy this game because I would think controlling

51:43.480 --> 51:47.800
with the keyboard would just be ass well it's like I think back to like test drive and the

51:47.800 --> 51:52.600
Commodore 64 and as cool as that game was trying to play it with a keyboard was stupid well just

51:52.600 --> 51:58.040
remember that all the games for Windows stuff nowadays supports the Xbox 360 controller and

51:58.040 --> 52:03.480
of course the racing we wait wait wait if you have an Xbox 360 controller why don't you have a 360 and

52:03.480 --> 52:09.920
then you just buy you feel like a pro PC gaming but you're like I'm not that into PC gaming where

52:09.920 --> 52:16.480
I need to use the control is the audience for that that big I played crisis with a 360 controller

52:16.480 --> 52:25.080
me fine I'm not that into PC gaming so well the hooray for PC gamers because burnout paradise is

52:25.080 --> 52:31.080
a solid game and I'm sure they'll be enjoying that yeah another game coming to PCs everywhere

52:31.080 --> 52:37.320
everyday shooter is coming to steam and that was a pretty awesome game on PlayStation Network I

52:37.320 --> 52:42.280
would know though because I hate having to put my credit card information on the PlayStation Network

52:42.280 --> 52:51.040
so until those cards come out I won't buy it but it looks cool so that's 10 bucks and I think is

52:51.040 --> 52:57.000
available now everybody shooters available on PlayStation Network now but not steam yet or is

52:57.000 --> 53:05.520
it on steam now it might be on steam right now I'm actually I think it's available now hmm orange

53:05.520 --> 53:10.400
on radio giving you definitive gaming news every week and we think it's out there it's out there

53:10.400 --> 53:14.480
now all right I'm like I could log on just if I didn't think it would disrupt the all-game stream

53:14.480 --> 53:18.600
I would log into stream or steam right now just to check you know I have to get that audio surf

53:18.600 --> 53:22.480
game to on steam I keep hearing good things about that the only thing I bought on steam is portal

53:22.480 --> 53:34.320
not anybody cares yeah so movie news more video games becoming movies one game that has been opted

53:34.320 --> 53:42.240
apparently for a movie I guess what's going on is that Naughty Dog has made the game uncharted

53:42.240 --> 53:49.960
Drake's Fortune and it's been optioned by Atlas Entertainment so that means that it is possible

53:49.960 --> 53:53.920
that in the next few years uncharted Drake's Fortune could actually actually become a movie

53:53.920 --> 53:58.200
now when I think about video games that I want to become movies this isn't really one that pops

53:58.200 --> 54:02.760
right into my head but okay I think it could work though because it's not cut much of a stretch it's

54:02.760 --> 54:12.520
just you know action adventure thing mm-hmm so uncharted the movie may be coming to a theater

54:12.520 --> 54:20.840
near you in about two years we'll see we'll see well there's other movies in talk actually says

54:20.840 --> 54:28.680
that it's already in development is a Bioshock movie to be put out by Universal with Gore

54:28.680 --> 54:40.160
Verbinski as the director it seems so hey that's kind of cool you did your to the Caribbean and it

54:40.160 --> 54:47.200
also looks like they've got John Logan as the screenplay writer well they've made a lot a lot

54:47.200 --> 54:52.320
more with a lot less so you know the thing about Bioshock though is that when I play Bioshock it's

54:52.320 --> 54:56.800
kind of like watching a movie you know what I mean like I don't know like we're getting to this point

54:56.800 --> 55:00.400
where games are so realistic they don't have to be made into movies because they already kind of feel

55:00.400 --> 55:07.360
like movies does that make sense nope sorry not hearing you but uh doesn't mean that they won't

55:07.360 --> 55:14.120
make a movie out of it all right fine well it's just you know if there's money to be made they're

55:14.120 --> 55:19.520
gonna make the money yeah right I hear ya but I don't know there's just there's other games that

55:19.520 --> 55:23.640
I would want to see made into movies first like some of the other Final Fantasy games I don't know

55:23.640 --> 55:29.560
but maybe that's just the family you know one good Final Fantasy movie and that was Advent Children

55:29.560 --> 55:40.000
yeah yeah oh well well Grand Theft Auto 4 talking about it again of course its first week sold or

55:40.000 --> 55:49.280
made half a billion dollars isn't bad I guess selling the 6 million copies and 3.6 million of

55:49.280 --> 55:57.080
those the first day so that's pretty awesome and I'm sure well they're expecting I think to do

55:57.080 --> 56:02.520
another you know a total of a billion dollars by the end this year so which is even bigger than a

56:02.520 --> 56:06.600
movie yeah you know the only movie that made that much money in the u.s. league is that an

56:06.600 --> 56:11.800
international figure or just a u.s. figure it's international okay well still I mean Titanic is

56:11.800 --> 56:16.840
like one of a few only very very few movies is made a billion internationally you know what I

56:16.840 --> 56:26.680
mean most of that is in I want to say in the u.s. because the UK I read only sold like about 900

56:26.680 --> 56:33.320
just under a million units so only there's a lot of games oh well I mean just under a million when

56:33.320 --> 56:38.320
you know about you know five millions coming from the u.s. I'd say that's a majority of you know the

56:38.320 --> 56:45.360
sales there all right fine but still yeah it's gonna do very well I mean it's been what parodied

56:45.360 --> 56:50.440
on a bunch of different things now if it's on Saturday Night Live and Conan so although it's

56:50.440 --> 56:54.680
kind of lame I don't know it was a little stupid but yeah I mean it's definitely hitting the

56:54.680 --> 57:00.840
mainstream so all right I got to back up in stories and talk about the Bioshock movie because

57:00.840 --> 57:04.720
there's some comments from chat chat that orange launch radio.com act-deaf wants to know will the

57:04.720 --> 57:09.320
main character save the Little Sisters or not Quill Tippo wants to know will Johnny Depp star

57:09.320 --> 57:16.680
as a spinny slicer and Brahma says just because the fan base is massive that does not mean the

57:16.680 --> 57:22.640
fans will buy it possibly talking about buying into a Bioshock movie I'd see it I actually see

57:22.640 --> 57:26.360
it too just kind of out of curiosity I would be kind of curious how they'd approach that too

57:26.360 --> 57:29.920
though because you know there's the whole Little Sister thing and you can do very good things are

57:29.920 --> 57:35.640
very bad things depending on your moral compass I need we ethics to help me make the decision here

57:35.640 --> 57:46.840
here hold on a second okay it says I should kill you we ethics as a yeah it's not your day magic

57:46.840 --> 57:54.840
eight ball real of morality turn turn turn show me which person I should burn that's the best

57:54.840 --> 58:04.680
ever Oh outcome not favorable yeah sorry fire all right APB is a game that is coming out from real

58:04.680 --> 58:10.080
time worlds and real time worlds they are they just bought the distribution rights to the game

58:10.080 --> 58:15.880
it's a big MMO coming out and basically they're making no shame about this they are saying they

58:15.880 --> 58:21.000
want to try and get this to Rockstar as Grand Theft Auto online yeah originally real-time

58:21.000 --> 58:27.140
worlds they actually developed a game and they had sold the rights to I remember who the hell they

58:27.140 --> 58:31.360
sold it to well they sold it to somebody but they bought it back anybody back because you know APB

58:31.360 --> 58:37.000
will real-time worlds to crack down you know awesome sandbox game and this one's kind of like

58:37.000 --> 58:45.040
it's a grant or sandbox online game basically where we have half the people are cops half of

58:45.040 --> 58:51.600
them you know our crooks and all sorts of chaos is going on so it's like a cross between cops and

58:51.600 --> 58:57.640
robbers Saints Row Grand Theft Auto online so it's not bad so yeah it'd be pretty easy as long as

58:57.640 --> 59:01.680
there are guns and rocket launchers I'm sold it's it looks pretty awesome that's the one they had

59:01.680 --> 59:07.520
during the tech demo they had the it was like all the is during game developers conference they had

59:07.520 --> 59:14.720
the custom characters and one of them was Shiggy oh yeah it was with the mark over the mushroom

59:14.720 --> 59:20.240
boxers and oh yes very awesome character creator now we should say though right now this is in

59:20.240 --> 59:24.880
rumor status it's not confirmed shares if it comes out as a PPL still played it's awesome

59:24.880 --> 59:34.960
all right fanboy much yes hey I like my sandbox games what can I say well they like you too

59:34.960 --> 59:43.040
all right well let's move on with our next story well what's the best part about Mortal

59:43.040 --> 59:49.800
Kombat Rob um katana what does everybody else think the best thing about Mortal Kombat is

59:49.800 --> 59:58.880
Rob uh friendships fatalities oh yes fatalities so of course as we know Midway said that Mortal

59:58.880 --> 01:00:07.280
Kombat vs. DC was going to be a t-rated fighting game with you know no fatalities but what it is

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:16.920
is they're not going to be as outrageous as they were but they are modifying the fatalities they

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:22.360
are going to still be finishing moves in there remember the last time they modified fatalities

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:32.640
for the Super Nintendo release sweat yo yeah all I gotta say and honestly though I'm going to

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.120
reserve judgment but I only want that game to play as Batman so whatever amen but see it's it

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:48.120
is all about that one quote he says I'm the goddamn Batman it is sacrilegious though to

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.640
perform a fatality on Batman that's what I still don't get he can perform fatalities all he wants

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.360
although Batman I don't think really kills people like he does now well yeah I mean like in in the

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.680
movies usually when people die it's their own fault like Batman didn't like try to kill them

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.240
they just died you know what I mean depends on who's actually Batman at any given time in the

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.760
comics but see the Batman God in my world is Adam West from the 60s Batman and he never killed no

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.440
one so really Batman shouldn't be doing fatality I didn't kill him it was gravity that killed him

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.320
gravity and the sudden sudden stopping it was it was an accident he fell down an elevator shaft

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:36.960
on his bullets there you go yes anyways games like Mortal Kombat have been claimed before to turn

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:44.760
children into bloodthirsty killers but Harvard says otherwise because you know Harvard everybody

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.360
they're super smart right so we gotta listen to what they say or rich or rich hey well that's even

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:55.920
more reason listen to them a pair of Harvard researchers say violent video games don't turn

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.520
children into killers their parents do according to a newly published book Grand Theft Childhood

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.520
the surprising truth about video games what parents do psychologists Lawrence Kuttner and

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.680
Cheryl Olson this spell of course common myths about video games and apparently they found during

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.880
their two-year study that there was no data to support any connection between games and real-life

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.920
fire this is not the first time I've heard of this book it sounds pretty good no and says they

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:34.400
studied 1200 middle school children in a 1.5 million dollar or federally funded study and

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:40.440
says instead of studying children in the laboratory like other studies they actually sat down talk to

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:47.520
kids after long bouts of game playing sometimes in excess of 15 hours a week lucky kids I guess

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.280
we're playing a variety of games from nonviolent The Sims I don't know depends how you play The

01:02:53.280 --> 01:03:04.760
Sims my Sims sessions are pretty violent so to was it a Grand Theft Auto and they discovered

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:10.520
children who played violent video games those rated mature or above were just relieving stress

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.560
some children did exhibit playful fighting after playing games but it was similar to have what

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:23.600
children have done always after watching action or karate type movies 51% of the male children who

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:31.640
played for 15 hours or more a violent video games per week were involved in fights in the past year

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:40.920
compared to 28% Oh who yeah compared to 28% who regularly or played regular video games doesn't

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:48.520
make much hmm I guess who did not play video games anyways articles got the wrong text there

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:56.880
for girls 40% of the violent game players were in fights compared to I guess 14 of the nonviolent

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:03.240
players now so despite these figures I guess Kuttner and Olson say this is just a correlation

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:09.520
and that fighting was probably due to underlying psychological problem the children had before

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:16.400
playing video games I like how they just kind of just they're all you know even though the data

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:23.800
suggests that you know they may be prone to more violence just ignore that I'm very curious about

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.720
the book that's coming out though I actually might pick that up to read it it could be very

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.880
interesting I think it's already out no I know it just I think it just came out or it was like

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.040
about to come out like I think it was the thing I checked it out on amazon.com like about a month

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.160
ago and it was coming out like at the end of the month so I'm curious about it it's available now

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.120
well there you have it is that is it being widely distributed you think I could walk in any Barnes

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:55.000
and Noble and get it probably it says well right now on amazon.com you can get it for $16.50 all

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.840
right we are about to the end of this episode of orange launch radio part a anyway because there's

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.000
the whole part B that's coming up after a short break but we're doing something very kind of

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.200
unprecedented tonight during our live show we have I don't we haven't done this live ever since we

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:18.040
were still on life 365 and doing the three-hour show when there was no separate podcast and that

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:26.000
is tonight folks we are going to have a live cage match now here's the thing now live listeners

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.720
recognize this music because they know that after the show is done being taped for the night we like

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.920
to do some other silly segments at the end of the show and something we call the olr afterbirth and

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:43.000
usually we pick licensed songs you know from CDs out there that we enjoy in iTunes we put them up

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.920
against each other in this segment that we call the cage match well tonight we're doing something

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:55.160
a little bit different tonight the cage match is involving the grand theft auto for contest entries

01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:00.960
that orange lounge radio received this week we have whittled it down to four finalists tonight

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:07.720

actually listening live tonight so you get a bonus point I guess are you ready to get to the four

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.040
finalists sure first I want to say we got a lot of great entries and I wish we could play them all

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.160
but we'd have to do like a whole separate podcast or something so we had to narrow it down to four

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.200
but the important thing is you all made us laugh our asses off and that's the important thing all

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.520
right so you ready to get to the four finalists here we go the first finalist by the way let me

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:19.040
let me recap for you guys what the contest rules were you know how in Grand Theft Auto 4 they have

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.920
to make or I mean in Grand Theft Auto 4 they have the radio station that plays when you're driving

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:31.560
around town well our entrance had to make a bumper that could possibly be heard on the radio in Grand

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:36.120
Theft Auto 4 but it had to incorporate Orange Lounge radio somehow like either one of our in

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:41.200
jokes or one of our hope you just had to do to have something to do with Orange Lounge radio all

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.040

was entry number one coming to us from act death let's go around and give our thoughts on that dark

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:26.380
Sakura a little derivative I think so it gets a seven all right um look I would have given that a very high

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.520
score but look you made way too much fun of me and those are clips that like are like five years

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:39.280
old and I am so pissed off that they've resurfaced not really but you know whatever I just they were

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:46.840
taken out of context I'll also give it a seven Loki I can't read that high because it mainly relied

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:52.920
on clips of the show and to work it wasn't really that original you know so I'm gonna give it like

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:58.160
a five all right but remember it is not our votes that matter our votes don't mean shit we're like

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.200

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:41.040
execution of said idea but they're not professionals we have to go a little easy on them but that's why

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.920
you go back and listen to it and when you realize you're speaking into the microphone then you go

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:53.440
back and move the microphone away from your mouth you know so it gets a seven all right yeah it was

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.840
a little popping but he's for me that you know and this is a problem we even have on the show

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.560
sometime because we don't have sufficient mic guards and it would really depends on the mic

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.320
you use so I'm being a little more lenient because you might just have a junky mic the idea was good

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.960
though I actually would have added like some music or something to make it a little more upbeat but

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.360
maybe I didn't know how so I can't punish you for that but I think I think it's gonna be tough

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.960
against these other finalists but I'll also give you a seven Loki better if you had a lot more like

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:28.080
internet clips of like babies cooing or like and like explosions more explosions more baby sounds

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.160
and that I think that would have been like pretty awesome but I'll give you like a seven because it

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:39.200
was you know definitely more original and clean clips all right here comes finalist number three

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.960

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:53.880
good and it's very pimp like Grand Theft Auto is so I I give that a seven as well but again the

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.160

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.000
it was pretty good i love that it was just i mean seriously like he's a scholar of orange

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.040
lounge radio in jokes it was one in joke after the other it just not like i love the part where dark

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:34.200
sakura uh could not participate because or because it would be like what did he say he said it was

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:40.200
because she was too she's too busy dying or no if if you hear it you will die in a fire it's no die

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:45.400
in a boat fire wall something like underwater volcano like every reference back to back in an

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:52.200
ocean abyss like just back to back but i don't know where in the hell you found that clip of me

one more thing we got to get to before we can end part a tonight and that is uh getting to our

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.600
classic game of the week we got to pay respect to our elders a little bit because without our

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.400
elders in gaming there would be no grand theft out of four so uh dark sakura take it away and tell us

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:12.760
your classic video game of the week my classic game of the week is one that i have brought up

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:21.480
a number of times on the show which is one of the greatest shooting games of our is radiant

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:31.480
silver gun radiant silver gun is uh developed by treasure i have played this in the arcade and i'm

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:36.840
still trying to freaking find the saturn copy because i mean it's fucking radiant silver gun

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:42.200
hello and the good thing about this game this is one of the things that i always always liked is

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:50.920
that you had um your weapons were all available at the same time um your defense was all available

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.480
your different power ups um you could um do a regular forward gun called the vulcan you had um

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:05.480
homing missiles and you had a spread burst effect then you had like a lock-on spread you had one

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:11.400
that would shoot one beam in the front and then a ton of beams in the back you had um a plasma

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:19.000
weapon that sort of reminds me a little bit more um of the weapon the the uh electricity weapon from

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.320
uh riding dx remember except it was very thin and it would be blocked by um whatever happened like a

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:33.080
different uh items that were in the way um and then you had something called the radiant sword

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:39.640
which was a sword that could shoot out from either side um there was also a few uh

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.480
see you didn't actually have your power up you just level up your current weapons

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:51.160
um one of my favorite ones in here is these uh these two balls that come out right in front of

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:56.920
you but you shoot them out and they hover and then destroy whatever is in their way and um i also

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:03.800
like this sword that comes out from behind and then comes out in a wide arc and claps together

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.000
right right in front i think that's a very cool thing um it was very bullet heavy um

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and like the one level that um rob's playing um on uh on the beat right now is of the whole level

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.440
where you're fighting just this big ship that it rotates around you and moves and you have to move

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:32.440
with it and it was a very very challenging game um the saturn version um had a few different things

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:41.080
as in it would um have you play through all of the stages um to unlock everything so

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:48.200
it was like you were having to play it in chronological order too it was very bizarre

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.920
to start off at three then two then four six then one so there's all kinds of kinds of weirdness

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:59.960
with it but it's treasure so we expect weirdness from them um but you've also got um four major

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:06.040
characters yeah four different characters to choose from um and each of them has their own

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:13.400
little quirks and everything you've got you know the cape girl and everything so um the um arcade

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:19.880
mode um would be played basically without the cutscenes or the dialogue but there was a saturn

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:24.680
mode that did have a bit more story involved and that dialogue and stuff like there's one

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:28.440
old stage that you play and this has got dialogue running all through the person's

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:33.640
part of the stage and and it's that you know sort of old man voice saying and we did this back in

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:39.480
the day and somebody shot somebody and there was a big war and a lot of people died so that's

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:47.080
radius over here it's freaking awesome it's treasure all right it's like a shooter but with

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:52.520
with uniqueness i don't know how else to explain it it's treasure i mean the only thing that you

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:58.600
can say about a treasure game is that it's freaking treasure all of their games where

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:04.200
they may seem like a straightforward genre you know that you've seen 50 million times they take

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:10.280
something in it and innovate it they do something that turns it around and makes it completely

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:16.920
different and that's you know and of course um they did um ikaruga which um contrary to popular

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.960
belief is not a true sequel it's radiant silver again it's more of a spiritual story and it's

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:28.440
spiritual sequels radiant silver gun but um i still honestly i think a radiant silver gun is

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:34.280
superior to ikaruga but that's me and if treasure knows what's good for them we will be getting

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:41.640
we will be getting more uh i guess uh re-releases of radiant silver gun

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:49.720
and they'll give them directly to me and only you and gs68 points out something that i was going to

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:57.000
mention is that radiant silver gun was inspired by image fight which was by um irm and that's the um

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.760
the team that gave us well the company that gave us our type and also completely unrelated to

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.760
radiant silver gun but since i mentioned our type i have to say this is that if you ordered

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.800
that r-type strategy game you get um an r-type we covered that last week but that's all right

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.680
i have one oh very cool you like it how big is it it's we couldn't figure that out on last week's

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.240
show three inches long huh it's fairly decent size okay i'll bring it next week and put it

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:26.360
on the cam so everyone can see all right but you know where i hate tactics games um i love

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.840
our types dan cavett so it cancels each other out and you're ambivalent about the game i was like

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.920
game i have i have the r-type thingy but no radiant silver yet it's treasure and i should

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:41.960
do nothing to treasure games like for the next couple weeks but i don't know what you know we

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:46.200
we got a game i was actually gonna originally do either you know i i've i'm gonna have to help you

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.120
out one of these weeks because i need to start seeing some commodore 64 11 these classic games

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:55.080
of the week no that's all right we've had a lot of good games oh we'll see we'll wait what what

01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.840
system did jamie not have commodore 64 right oh we'll wait for a week you're not here because

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.080
there's they'll come up before the end of the year at some point this is not the most awesome thing

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.760
ever it is a very cool looking game you know i you want no secret i've never played this game

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.360
i played it the only time i've actually played this game is in an arcade you know whenever we

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.520
actually get our little uh justin tv idea off the ground that we need to do that because i need to

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:23.080
play what i did the very next day what's that i had lunch with sauce it was in las vegas very nice

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:28.680
