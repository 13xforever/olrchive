Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3-day weekends in OLR world usually mean that we're going to get drunk for Sunday nights, but not this year.
It's kind of a downer.
Why not?
Well, Loki had to drive here, and of course you're not going to drink and drive.
That's not okay.
And DarkSakura, she's entertaining company, so she doesn't want to be passed out while company is here.
And me, I'm not allowed to drink medically right now because of everything I have with my pancreas.
I might have to stay away from alcohol for a long time.
But that's okay.
You don't need alcohol.
Alcohol's fun when done responsibly, but you don't need it.
So, Olive.
But I do need Olive Garden, so I hope I can eat something besides vegetables again soon.
We'll see.
Those of you playing the drinking game at home, take a shot.
Why?
Why do they take a shot?
Olive Garden.
Alright.
Anyhow, we're going to get back into the gaming news here on Part B. If you missed Part A, you should go back in the podcast feed and listen to it.
Unless you're listening live on Sunday, then unless you can rewind time, you're just going to have to wait for Part A to hit the podcast feed, which should happen soon.
But in the meantime, Wii News, Loki.
Yes, we didn't get this game over here.
They had a music game in Japan that translated to Band Brothers.
Also in Japan, they will be getting a brand new sequel to that game, which is entitled Band Brothers DX.
It will allow players to stream their best performances to their Wii for output through TV speakers, stereos, and home theater systems.
To accompany this,
We are getting a new channel called The Speaker Channel, which will allow you to do such things as that.
That's pretty interesting.
Also, I guess the Band Brothers game, the original one, is due out for the U.S.
as well, called Jam with the Band.
Or at least it was, but now I don't know if that's still coming out.
What if I don't want Jam with the Band?
What if I want to dance with myself?
But thou must.
I don't know.
So, it looks neat, I guess.
It sounds interesting.
Do you think it's something we might ever get here in the States?
Yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.
Nintendo likes releasing stuff here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Mega Drive had a game in Japan only.
It was called Glaylancer.
Not gray, that's glay.
G-L-E-Y.
Glaylancer came out, and that's supposedly going to be coming out here soon.
Konami had a game on the NES called Biomiracle Bakute Uppa.
I was gonna say yay!
Oh, you were?
Yeah.
I thought you were going to complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.
I was going to say yay and then complain it wasn't Shinobi World.
Alright, sorry.
My bad.
God, Rob.
So you can play... What's that game?
It's not Rock Paper Scissors.
What do they call it in Alex Kidd?
Jankenpon.
Jankenpon.
You can play that to your heart's content in Alex Kidd Miracle World.
Coming soon.
But now more news.
Product Placement Done Wrong
There's this huge, massive Wii Fit, you know, humongoid thing.
And it's right over Chevy's in Times Square.
But isn't it healthy because it's like fresh mix and stuff?
Yeah, it's fresh mix.
You can have a big fucking burrito and a big fucking margarita as big as your head.
It's exactly what I said earlier.
And you could be healthy because you'll go home to Wii Fit.
You won't care because you'll go home drunk and off.
Ain't it grand?
As long as I have a salad and bottomless chips and salsa, I'll be fine, right?
No.
But it's a salad, Jamie.
But I have to tell my Chevy story.
With avocado and sour cream, I'll be fine, right?
Sour cream.
Orange Lounge Radio is nowhere sponsored by Chevys.
I have a Chevy story, though.
All right, real quick.
Since we are Orange Lounge Foodio.
I ordered a margarita.
It was a prickly pear margarita.
And I ordered a small one so you know it was massive.
And they spilled a third of it.
Oh no, so I had to give you another one.
No.
What?
They refilled that third with tequila.
And I'm eating my seafood fajitas, which is probably the thing I get every time I go there, drinking down this hefty, and you know me and tequila on top of that.
You know, let's just, you know, it's like Drew said earlier, waffles.
Waffles, waffles, waffles
Well, A, I just saw Guardian Legend on my TV, so I got distracted for a minute.
Shiny.
Loki's playing with all these things you shouldn't be on the Wii right now.
Sorry.
It's very distracting.
From here on, I'm going to associate Wii Fit with Chevys and therefore margaritas, so whenever I think of Wii Fit, I'll get drunk.
I'll tell you what, though.
I think the product placement is working.
I mean, maybe not this particular case, but you can't find Wii Fit anywhere right now.
I missed launch day.
I slept through it or whatever, and I didn't get the game when it came out, and I'll never get it now.
Right, Loki?
Yeah.
Probably.
It's in short supply right now because those Wii Balance boards are fucking hard to manufacture.
I was in GameStop in Las Vegas a few days ago, one of the most obese cities in the nation, and there were like 75 Wii Fit boards.
Just sitting there, it was like they couldn't get rid of them.
Damn it!
Please take these!
Damn it, I'm shopping in the wrong place.
Because people are like, money?
I have to gamble that away.
See, Kikoman2DX in chat says Wii Fit is in Costco.
I was just at Costco today, and no it wasn't.
I looked.
I mean, maybe in your neck of the woods, but not mine, sadly.
In regards to Wii Fit, just a little reference to the hardcore old school computer nerds out there.
Two words spring to mind.
Guru meditation.
Imagine that on the Wii Fit board.
How about dance aerobics?
That's old school for you.
Dance Aerobics.
Remember that game on the NES for the power pad?
Yeah, Dance Aerobics was hardcore.
Well, don't they have something like that coming out in Japan from Namco?
It's got a little power pad thing.
Dude, they could do it with real music now, too.
They don't need those crappy little... Well, not that NES music was crappy, because it wasn't, but they could actually have real songs in it and stuff.
I could work out to Britney Spears.
It'd be fun.
Well, it would be fun.
For a minute.
For a minute?
This game may not be Wii Fit and it certainly is not Dance Aerobics but coming to WiiWare soon is a game that is probably just as important and that would be the official beer pong game.
Just what I needed!
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Why would you be playing beer pong?
Frat party games in preparation for being 21?
There's no point!
So no word on when it's going to come out or how much it's going to be, but I can tell you right now Or how drunk you won't get playing it Yeah, how drunk you won't get I feel totally wasted right now
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's Spinal and Orchid and Glacius.
Was that his name?
Combo Breaker.
Combo Breaker and all those characters that were in Killer Instinct.
And I'll be damned if this rumor doesn't come up once a year.
It's back.
And it's thanks to EGM and the Quarterman.
He always has us call him an EGM.
Apparently...
Rare is going to be making a third entry in the Killer Instinct franchise.
Of course, Rare's denied this before, but apparently there is a game in the works.
Killer Instinct 3D, Death, Destruction, and Doom.
Get it?
3Ds.
Death, Destruction, and Doom.
It's apparently on the Xbox 360.
Will she still have the boob attack?
I hope so.
Yes, please.
Apparently, though, it will not be using the pre-rendered stuff that was seen in the previous games, which is kind of a bummer.
It'll just be 3D visuals and more robust gameplay, whatever that means.
Bigger bus!
Yay!
Bigger bus!
Because Maya had some pretty big busts.
I don't know if you saw that, but that was a combo breaker of a different kind.
It should be more mobust replay.
Yeah.
Ultra combo me any day.
I don't know.
Take with a giant grain of salt, but I don't think any of us would complain if this were true.
Right?
I know I wouldn't.
You know what they should do when there's a game that's being announced that everyone's been rumoring for it to come out for a long time?
They should send everybody in the press a giant grain of salt.
That would be hilarious.
That would be fun.
Good idea.
I need a moment.
My browser just died.
Uh-oh.
So we can't get to the next story now?
I'm all over it.
What are we going to do?
The show is collapsed.
Quickly then, some more discussion.
Things you would most want to see in Killer Instinct 3.
What do you think Killer Instinct 3 needs more than anything?
Jumblies.
Banjo-Kazooie.
No, it does not.
Okay, it's up.
There are supposed to be new colors for the DS in Europe if anyone gives half a crap.
Puke green, according to Tiara.
There is... I like how the article said slime green.
That's actually lime green.
Hot red and ice blue.
And it's supposed to have dates of June 13th.
Hot Red, Ice Blue, Lime Green, American Gladiators
One of those shows that's so bad, it's good.
I watch American Gladiators every week.
Good times.
You would.
I love American Gladiators.
It's great.
I hope they make a new game.
All I have to say is that in the previews, Atlas Sphere is coming back this year.
Thank God.
By the way.
Thank God.
What?
My man won.
I am pleased.
The old American Gladiators season one?
No, American Idol.
Oh, American Idol.
American Idol.
David Archuleta's dad would have an aneurysm.
Are we really having American Idol talk on the show right now?
I'm not having this discussion.
Okay, I'm done.
Next topic!
So, yeah, something I've been distracted by lately.
The Wii Homebrew channel has been released.
Yes, they've gotten it so bad now to where they can inject their own channels into the Wii, and it's just insane the amount of stuff that you can do now.
Emulators, games...
You name it, it's available and hopefully I'll be demonstrating it a little bit later.
But yes, it is available now.
You can install it using the Twilight hack, which is actually pretty interesting the way it works.
But pretty simple to do.
There's instructions all over the internet.
So if you want to get your homebrew on while it works, feel free to check your local...
We Hacking Community Forums and you should be able to find it.
Yeah, we reached out to Nintendo for some comment on what they were going to do about this situation and what they had to say about this whole thing.
That's all they had to say.
That's all they had to say.
No, because we can't drop E and rave.
and Hump, The Coin Return of a Pot of Pot of Machine.
They do have a bunch of stuff out for it right now.
You can get ScumVM for it.
They actually have a Tetris game that's someone's program.
There's emulators for practically everything.
Nintendo 64, TurboGrafx, Game Boy Color games, NES, Super NES.
They have a region-free player for GameCube games.
You can build that in there.
They've also got... You can upload Mii's to it.
You can...
Guardian Legend
Do you think this is something they'll block in a future patch?
Wouldn't this be very easy to close the hole in it?
They may be able to, but it's going to be pretty hard.
Or is this going to be like the PSP where it's ongoing?
I think it's going to be ongoing.
They haven't been able to block the Twilight hack thing, so that's going to be hard.
Even if this homebrew channel thing gets blocked, you can still use...
Thanks for watching!
Alright, well, going back over to Nintendo for a little bit, and Nintendo and Mistwalker's relationship.
You know, Mistwalker, of course, they have some games on the Xbox 360.
Kind of something interesting you may not realize.
Nintendo doesn't really have anything officially on the calendar right now after Wii Fit has been out.
Thanks for watching!
So if it's been raided by the ESRB, then there must be a localization on the way.
But that is interesting because that shows that Mistwalker is developing for more things than just Xbox.
But there is kind of that weird relationship with Microsoft-owned studios because there's the Viva Pinata game already announced for DS as well.
Well, THQ's doing a lot of those, and same with the Blue Dragon DS game, too.
Yeah, so it's not like Microsoft properties are afraid to go over to DS, which I think further cements the fact there won't be a Microsoft handheld anytime soon.
So those rumors can just go away.
Did you hear about how they were originally thinking about adding connectivity with Viva Pinata 2 and the Viva Pinata DS?
That would be very interesting, but could they do it?
Well, the way they had it done, it was only one way.
You could transfer stuff from your DS version to your Xbox 360, and the way they did it was... I don't know, there was another story coming out that they were going to have cards that you could buy or something that would allow you to...
I was going to say, this sounds like Eye of Judgment to me.
Yeah, and that's how the game would work.
It would produce a high-resolution picture on there, and then you would scan it with your camera.
Speaking of Eye of Judgment, I looked at the OLR wiki this week.
We've got awesome people maintaining the OLR wiki at orangelaunchradio.wikia.com.
You can learn a lot of stuff about the inside jokes of our show and everything.
Apparently, the Eye of Judgment has sold now 200,000 units.
We're one-fifth of the way there.
Never going to happen.
Never gonna happen.
I just love the fact that that's actually being tracked and updated on a regular basis.
Start squirming, Loki.
Start squirming.
Love it.
Five more years, it'll happen.
Alright.
Anyhow, we're gonna get back into some gaming news.
No, we're not.
We're gonna go to the mailbag because it's probably very full.
Too bad.
I refuse.
Too bad.
Then let the ferret read the emails tonight.
Let TR read them.
I don't care.
We gotta do some emails.
No, the only one I'm gonna read is hers.
Alright, Mailbag.
You're only going to read one email after two weeks being gone?
Yeah.
What do we want?
Plus a few others.
Alright, thank you.
Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to participate.
DarkSakura, open up the Mailbag, pull out a few of your favorites and read them.
This one says, Dear People, My girlfriend wants a DS and a PSP.
She has a PS3.
Please use... Oh my god!
Please use a period.
Thank you.
Okay, what was I saying?
Oh, yeah.
I was wondering... Did I mention when you email us, Jamie berates you?
I was wondering, she's only 16 and I'm wondering, you already said you were wondering if you had any ideas for a game to buy her she loves music, RPGs and FPS, what teen rated games in the genre are good so I can make her a happy gamer girl, peace out DSMaster25 and DSLoverPS, we worship Hannah Montana
Worship, W-O-E I Worship her too I would make a suggestion as for a good game For the DS, My Word Coach Yes
but you haven't really specified what system since you mentioned that she wants a DS and PSP indicating that she has neither and has a PS3 if they get a PSP there's not a lot of music games available for it actually there's no music games available for it in the United States Guitar Man, yeah that's about it I suggest getting her an Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip on it
First Person Shooters, you're going to find a few of them on PSP, not so many on the DS.
Give her a baby.
It's what she really wants.
Give her Imagine Babies.
She can have my copy.
I played it.
You saw me play it.
Tell her you're getting her ready for your long future together.
Anyway, so then I would... We're never going to get another email ever again.
If she already has a PS3, you might as well just stick with the PSP because then you can connect to it and download stuff via the PlayStation Store.
That's true.
There's also PlayStation 1 games that are available on there and also if you want to really hack the thing apart, you can...
and so on.
I also think that you should install a dictionary and a thesaurus and a grammar checker for your phone.
I think that this is cool because I honestly think that this person is Russian or from somewhere that uses the same form of alphabet.
I'm not really all that great with names.
But he sent the best screencap ever.
It's a Google search to define STFU and definitions of STFU on the web.
This is the only one that came up.
It's a weekly half hour show hosted by... It brings up the stuff on the show.
Nice, so an old reference to the show that DMN hosted on the network DJ Tyrant too Yes, and DJ Tyrant DMN, I don't think DJ Tyrant is involved with this Maybe it's a special guest or something But DMN has teamed up with Travis Donovan And they now do a show on All Games Radio If you haven't heard it yet It's Under Sedation Live 4.0 So it's the show that Jamie and I started on All grown up and retarded I was the number one guest You were
Plus I filled in for Jessica a couple times.
Yeah, now they're up to 4.0.
I filled in for you a couple of times.
Sure did.
Because I was lazy.
Where are they now?
Rob Roberts.
I got to sit in the speaker chair.
I just wanted to give a cheap plug.
Which we found the speaker chair.
Really?
At the Desiree thrift store.
Nice.
We checked.
Nice.
A few years ago.
Next email.
Okay.
This one comes from Sauce.
Okay, wait.
You have to explain for the listeners.
Listeners don't know Sauce.
What is Sauce?
Sauce.
There are a group of us who have known each other for probably going on over 10 years online.
And Kim, who is one of the group, used to always call me sis, but she's like a terrible typer, and she's like the typo queen.
So one day she typoed, and instead of, she was trying to say, sits on sis, and she put sots on sauce.
Okay.
And so ever since then, I've been Sauce, S-O-S.
And it just kind of, we made up names for everybody, like, after that.
Very nice.
And mine is, when we get together, it's Soy Sauce Reunion.
Soy Sauce.
Cute.
It works.
So, hello, Sauce, Rob, and other guys.
Girls are so weird, I swear.
Get ferreted.
Burn it.
Burn it.
Okay, this is the uber long review.
All right.
I never pronounced this right.
The Magia?
Yeah.
I hate them.
I hate Skrulls worse.
The story is good.
The graphics are more than fairly decent, as is most of the voice acting.
Tony Stark is much more brash and cocky than he is in the movie, and even I was surprised by some of the things he said.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Now I can take a breath.
You were really busy.
The drawback to this game, at least on the PSP, is the way the player controls the game.
The controls are very uncomfortable and took me quite a bit to get used to, especially the flying mechanics.
There is no option to change or rearrange the controls to make them easier to use.
Using the square X O triangle buttons to control the camera and analog stick to control pushing
forward backwards motion was very uncomfortable for me especially since pushing up on the analog stick makes you walk or hover forward but moving into flight mode makes pushing up on the analog stick actually makes you go crashing down so it reverses from standard running around mode to like jet controls
Alright, whereas pushing down on the analog stick makes you pull back up.
I suppose in a way this makes sense, but the sudden reversal of the controls makes flying a pain, especially when you wind up running around and then jumping into flight a lot.
It took me two run-throughs of the training level to get used to the controls, and even after 13 levels of play, I'm still hindered by the awkward controls.
Overall, Iron Man for the PSP is a fun game.
The controls, however, definitely detract from it overall.
If you're a die-hard Iron Man fan like I am, and she is...
This is worth having in your collection.
However, if your knowledge of Iron Man is based solely on the movie, I wouldn't bother.
My overall rating for this game is 6.5 out of 10.
Thanks and keep up the great job with the show, TRI.
P.S.
Rob is so eating cake on my birthday.
Frowning face.
We'll see, we'll see.
But that was a good review.
You should write reviews for our website whenever we get it working.
So there you go.
Yes, review wench.
Actually, Sauce has their own theme song.
And so we can play it.
I don't know.
Oh, no.
Erotic.
Oh, erotic.
I'll play erotic's version.
Yes.
But the tiger took my family.
That was, no.
I would play erotic.
But, no.
I would play erotic's version.
So that's officially, that is officially on Orange Young Radio.
Come on, they do a song called Help Me Dr. Dick.
We know this well.
But this will come into play later.
You know, someday in your nightmare, somebody's going to crop that little piece of show and play that over and over.
They have a song called Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.
And the very first song... And they were huge in DDR, by the way.
And the very first song I ever heard by them was before... Was actually when I was still playing Beatmania 98 before we even had a 2DX.
Or when DDR was still just a thought.
Was Don't Talk Dirty.
It was like the best...
I miss DDR when it had songs like this in it.
These songs are available on iTunes, by the way, and I highly suggest you buy the entire thing.
Buy the entire thing.
We cannot make this shit up.
We could, but we'd actually be telling the truth.
Next email!
Wait, hold on.
I have to read the... Look, I have the album Greatest Tits.
Here's the songs on Greatest Tits.
The Horniest Single in the World, Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex, Willie Use a Billy Boy, Help Me, Dr. Dick.
Fred, come to bed, turn me on, gotta get it grooving, give me good sex, Fritz, love my tits, sex on the phone, sexual madness, SOS, the winner takes it all, baby, please me, and in the dark of the night.
Because we all know what happens in the dark of the night.
We have booty calls all over the stuff.
We have two ABBA songs, and yeah.
So next email, okay?
I used to love sex on the phone, though.
This song was awesome.
Erotic's like the greatest band out of DDR.
But it doesn't have Don't Talk Dirty on it.
They have tons of albums.
It's not just the greatest hits.
Next email!
Dear Mailbag, like it can talk back, I'd like to think you all will have caught this piece of news, but since it was tagged onto the end of another story, I want to make sure you didn't miss it.
I know that Sky at least is a huge fan of ActRaiser.
And there's a link that says, loves you, Apollo.
This message is not brought to you by Taco Bell because it is gross.
It's on Gamasutra.
I like what I'm hearing already about ActRaiser.
Square Enix is talking about WiiWare and new ActRaiser possibilities.
Like an ActRaiser game on WiiWare?
Like an all new thing?
I will save this for the end of the show.
That's awesome.
I will make you wait in anticipation.
Thanks.
Until Rob decides to play me some more erotic.
You want some more erotic?
No.
So that means you have to wait a really fucking long time.
Do I have Don't Talk Dirty?
You should play it after the show.
If I can find it.
I don't know if I have it.
We'll see.
Next email.
What?
This is an iTunes sample.
It doesn't have the actual chorus in there.
Don't Talk Dirty was great.
Anyway, this comes... It says, is the music in the background of your FUs of the week Jumpman by Buckethead, or did you remix it?
No.
I remixed it from Jumpman by Buckethead.
Oh, you did?
Okay.
Pointless question by TJ Zeppelins in the chat.
And since I wasn't on the mic, I remixed that from Jumpman by Buckethead.
Yes.
That was where my O came from.
Hey!
Hey, you, get out of my car.
Hey, listen.
Yesterday I listened to the Bobby Blackwolf show in OLR on the PSP's official internet radio player.
The quality was really good, and there were no interruptions except for the times I disconnected and tried to reconnect.
I have a couple of questions.
One, is there any way to set the presets on the player, or is there another player that will work on the official Sony firmware?
Sometimes it was hard to find the all-game stream.
Sadly, I don't think there is.
I've played with that whole thing limitedly on the PSP.
I don't think there is a way to do it, sadly.
The PSP thing is very limited.
It sucks.
Rob, you were painting my neck.
Sorry.
It's okay.
And for your intro.
Anyhow.
I need a ferret.
Hey, listen.
Hey, listen.
Hey, listen.
2.
Is there any PSP compatible way of IRC chatting?
Listening live is great, but I want to chat too.
Alpha Canogram says it's called FreePlay.
It works for official firmware.
I'm using it now and he's in chat.
I also posted this in chat because I think the PSP and other devices could eventually be portable internet radio devices that could receive shows from all over the world.
and the next question, when is the fuck show going to happen or has Black Wolf already shut that one down?
Well, I guess Understudiation Life 4.0 does have that one every Saturday, LOL.
Thanks, PKJr92.
No matter where you go, you're there.
We've said fuck an awful lot this episode, though, haven't we?
If we told you when it was, that would break the rules of the fuck show.
Yes, the fuck show is a surprise.
I will tell you when it is not.
The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.
And the sixth anniversary show is going to be... Whatever the fuck we want it.
June... On the sixth anniversary.
It can either be the... Probably the 22nd is the closest.
June 22nd will be our sixth birthday.
So I don't know what we're doing for that yet.
Yeah.
Sixth birthday.
Wow.
Yeah, I know, for real.
Our show is old enough to be in first grade.
Wow.
Six years ago, Orange Lounge Radio started.
I know, it's crazy.
Fuck.
That's what I said.
Fuck.
Alright.
So, um, next email.
Oh my god, I've got three left, okay.
I'm trying to be nice because we weren't here last weekend.
Um, is there, okay, oh, we have one called Hello.
Hello.
Is there anyone there?
Have you fallen off the world?
I miss you.
Sad face Rick from UK.
I think that was when our stream went forever with no new updates.
Part B went out on Friday or Saturday, so hopefully... Rob had the plague.
Yes, I had SARS.
No, no, no, no, no.
They put him on the cart even.
He was about to get carried off to the incendiary.
But then he said he was going to go up for a walk.

My cat got it back.
I was going to say my cat pooped the rubber band today.
I'm so fucking proud.
I am so fucking proud of you.
I'm not really.
Is that what this show is resorted to?
But cats are like our children.
Coming up in Wii News, oh, my cat pooped out a rubber band today.
I'm very concerned because that means she ate a rubber band.
It could have killed her.
My cat eats grass.
Seriously, fuck this show.
Can I re-fix email?
Sure, I don't care anymore.
So I says I can't, so this segment's over.
Okay.
Hello, everyone in the world!
We may as well be fucking doing a drunk show because we're all lunatics.
Seriously, I would be drinking right now if it wouldn't kill me.
For those of you who do not know me, I don't know you, so okay.
No, I'm kidding.
My name is Chris Phillips, a.k.a.
ChrisPhil1724.
Must be a really old school name.
A tournament slash event organizer for all games and allgames.com.
Oh, yeah, he used to do video stuff for all games.
I know he is.
He's a good man, Charlie Brown.
Don't cough up a rubber band.
on July 24th, 2005.
Bobby Blackwolf aired his first live show on All Games Radio, known as The Bobby Blackwolf Show.
This show was, in fact, the first ever weekly podcast on All Games Radio.
Ever since that date, The Bobby Blackwolf Show has aired a new show every Sunday night at 8 p.m.
EST, 5 p.m.
PST, a streak that has lasted nearly 35 months.
This weekend was marked as the first week in 147 weeks without a new episode of The Bobby Blackwolf Show ending his remarkable run.
Now, Bobby would never broadcast this noteworthy accomplishment, and you may not even like the fact that I'm doing this.
As fellow podcasters, you all know how hard it is to do a show week in and week out.
To that end, I feel this achievement is worth mentioning, and congratulations are in order.
If you'd like to write a small email to Bobby or... Oh my god, I'm sorry.
We're doing it live, Bobby!
Yay!
Well done, DarkSakura.
Let's hear it for Bobby Blackwell.
I was looking for the moaning noises, but alright.
No, that is a good accomplishment.
It really is.
I mean, God, we're lucky if we go ten weeks.
Alright.
Dear OLR and Loki 2, you know how that's gonna go.
You're going to know in the first four words how that's going to go.
I have a Macintosh.
and I don't use it to play games I can understand why Loki would not like a Macintosh computer because he uses his computer to play video games now can we shut up about this whole Loki hates Macintoshes thing they just don't deserve they just don't serve his needs to be honest we've sort of dropped this a long ass fucking time ago it's the listeners that keep bringing it up am I right?
Well, once in a while there'll be a story and he'll make a snide comment that reminds us, but I don't think there's been a good old-fashioned brawl over it in a while.
The only people bringing it up is the fucking Mac users.
My wife does this every time a stupid Mac commercial comes on TV.
She's like, see, they said it's true.
I'm like, shut up.
It's on TV.
It must be true.
I'll never forget when the Mac fan came to Fonamay.
Oh, shit.
I remember that last year.
Which, by the way, notice we're not at Fonamay this year.
I don't care.
It was a conspiracy by Mac users.
No, we'll be back at Fonamay next year.
I promise.
We have to.
If we're still around, my god, we're getting old.
You are.
If we don't die of old age first.
You're gonna die of the plague.
Thanks.
I'm gonna die of awesome.
Dr. Mario will cure it.
I'm gonna die of awesome.
Alright, are you gonna read any more of this email?
Should I?
Pick a paragraph.
Read a paragraph.
I'll read more.
That's not why I wrote.
I wrote because I have a few things I want to say about Nintendo.
Okay, whatever.
Um...
is basically saying that Nintendo sells a lot of stuff.
The end.
Maybe you should post that on the super long email of the week thread.
I'm actually going to do that because right now my throat hurts.
And it actually is from Hippolytus, a.k.a.
Black Boy, who we remember.
Yes.
You are actually going to be the person who brings back the long-ass fucking email thread of the week.
on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Congratulations.
Does this call for fanfare?
Yes.
It's a good email, but my throat hurts a lot.
I will post it on the forums and link it in the chat room.
Long email is very long.
If you want to send us long emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Meantime, more gaming news.
Yes, Loki?
Yes.
I was just reading something else that's kind of interesting.
But this is sort of interesting.
It'd be more interesting if it weren't the N-Gage.
But, uh, yes.
Metal Gear Solid Mobile has somehow found its way on the N-Gage.
That's right.
You will be able to play Metal Gear Solid.
The winner of two 2007 International Mobile Gaming Awards.
And, uh...
Apparently it's coming to the N-Gage shortly after the launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 for the PS3.
So, um... That's cool, I guess.
At least they're getting some actual big-name games.
N-Gage is still around.
Yeah.
Well, do you remember Nolan Bushnell?
I hope you do, because he was one of the...
Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese, right?
That was Pizza Time Theater.
Well, whatever.
I like the name better.
And Pong, right?
Yes.
Well, he apparently was speaking at the Wedbush Morgan Securities Annual Management Access Conference.
And he's saying the game piracy, it's on its way out.
He says, quote, there is a stealth encryption chip called a TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now.
It's not gonna work.
Why is that?
Because everything can be cracked.
And the fact that you said that it can't be cracked is just going to make people want to crack it.
It is an invitation to the crackers to say, please crack this.
Trust me, if it can be modified, it will be modified on the board.
Or they'll find a way to emulate it and they'll just disable it.
There are ways to do everything.
It has been done before.
Or they'll just stop buying games altogether.
Thanks for watching!
There are games out there now that have it, you know, where you have to play it, you know, and it talks to a server online to validate that it's an official copy of the game.
Those have been cracked.
You know, there's stuff on the PSP that they've had countless firmware upgrades that are supposed to prevent piracy and stuff.
Those have all been cracked.
I mean, what... Ranma in chat, chat.orange.com says, Intel tried that with their Pentium 3 chips and boards.
It didn't work.
Yeah, I mean, it's a nice attempt, and, you know, people should be a little bit more legit with stuff, but it's just not gonna happen.
It really isn't, so... I don't know.
Just because you stop people from pirating a game does not mean that they are gonna go buy your game.
That's the other problem, too.
Because they're assuming that people that are pirating these things had intended to buy it in the first place.
That's not always the case.
That's a good point.
I think a lot of pirates probably wouldn't even bother buying the games.
I really think that.
But it sounds like maybe he's trying to combat piracy in other countries, not necessarily just the US, but where it's way more rampant.
You think that might be the case?
Good luck.
But if anything, the Chinese and stuff, they've gotten piracy down big time.
So I don't see this affecting much.
All right.
Well, I don't know about you guys, but I get the feeling we've heard this all before.
And when I hear things and I don't see results, I get irritated.
And when I get irritated, we do the FUs of the week.
F you to the dollar store.
We went to get a USB cable, and there were none out on the shelf.
Like, the whole supply of them wasn't there.
So I asked if someone would go and look in the back and see if there were any, because just about any other store I go to, people are willing to look in the back and just, oh, we don't have any.
So that was it.
F you to the virtual friends in Grand Theft Auto 4.
I don't want to go do activities with you.
That's why I'm not calling you back, you idiots.
But at least they have sleep mode.
But it's still annoying.
Yes, it's still annoying though when you have people going, I haven't heard from you forever.
I want to go drinking.
It's like, fuck that.
I have to shoot pigeons.
So they don't understand.
My FU of the week goes to the antibiotic C-Pro, which I was taking because the doctor thought I had an infection, even though I'm pretty sure I had a virus based on the high fever I had and the fact that the antibiotics didn't really work.
but I was taking it for so long that finally like my chest started to like tighten up and I got a big old red rash on my chest so I stopped taking it because that's not a good reaction to have especially when you just had pancreatitis so I chose to stop taking it so F you to C-Pro DrewNami F you to friends, so-called friends who make their mission in life to bring your ass down I'm not naming names no one anyone here would know
FU to Rock Band and all its goodness for making my throat hurt like hell and FU to Mellow Gear Solid 2.
Stop busting me.
Just because I suck.
Anything you want to say FU to?
I'm good, thanks.
FU to you for being so happy.
Yeah, really, we're jealous.
I know, what's your secret?
Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
Let's get back into some gaming news.
DarkSakura is going to take it.
Well, she's coughing.
I just wanted to ask, are you sure you didn't have anthrax?
Because Cipro is what they give you if you have anthrax.
For real, huh?
No, I did not have anthrax.
Thank gosh.
I do have an anthrax CD somewhere.
Did you start developing the rash as soon as you started taking it?
No, it was about five days into it.
Five days into it?
Yeah.
of course she didn't have anthrax it does suck I've been to the doctor so much in the past two months I couldn't go back over the rash I was just like you know what I feel fine I'm just not going to take it I have some drug stuff to talk to you about after the show too because I know drug stuff yay drugs drugs are rad there's a new Pokemon game coming out yay
Pokemon, colors we haven't thought of yet.
I still like my Pokemans, but I have a feeling this will be just Emerald all over again.
Pokemon's a good game.
I don't know, Platinum sounds like... I don't know.
I can't help but think of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
I played Pokemon Pearl for a while, but I only played it at the gym while I was riding the recumbent bike.
So, apparently the casting has, or some rumors about casting have come out about the Prince of Persia movie, and Jake Gyllenhaal is now reported to be the Prince of Persia.
Wow, that's... Because he looks so Persian.
I know.
Totally.
Dude, Bubble Boy is the Prince of Persia.
That's pretty awesome.
Bubble Boy was on TV the other day.
I've watched that way too many times.
But yeah, I don't know.
I can't be too excited about this.
He just looks too lethargic.
I'm sorry.
He's just very like... I have to act?
As long as it's hot like Brokeback Mountain, then we're fine.
I can't quit you, Prince of Persia.
Excuse me?
A baking powder?
Speaking of video game movies, $200 million!
$200 million, Variety reports.
Crystal Sky Pictures has signed this deal for $200 million financing.
And what this millions of dollars is going to be used, it's going to fund Castlevania
A sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled and Pac-Man, the movie.
So they're making Stranglehold the game, the movie, and then the game?
Because it'll come back around again.
What a horrible night to have a movie.
Now look, we know that Castlevania has been, like, this has been off and on with Rider Strike and everything.
We know this was on the table, but seriously, Pac-Man, the movie, like...
How in the hell is that going to work?
I mean, Pac-Man did have a TV show.
He's a drug addict.
It was a cartoon.
I guess if Pac-Man's a cartoon, it might work.
It's a dumb idea.
He's a pill popper.
It's a dumb idea, although we did throw around the premise of a Pac-Man movie.
One man in the future will save the world from Inky, Binky, and Clyde using dots.
Why are you talking like Triple H?
It's the movie man.
No, what you would do is you would have a cop on the edge, you know, played by Joe Pesci.
No, not Joe Pesci.
That would be funny, though.
He knew too much.
Now the ghosts of his past are after him.
Gerardimo wins.
He says the Pac-Man movie will have Kylie Minowas miss Pac-Man and it'll be awesome.
That's a good point.
Lame.
Do not want.
Do not want.
DarkSakura, what could they possibly do a Pac-Man movie about?
Have you ever seen the cartoon from the 80s?
Dude, the cartoon from the 80s was great, and there was Pac-Land.
Unless there is only one feasible way I could see this happening.
3D.
And it would not be a movie that they would be able to promote very well.
is if they did a Pac-Man porno where they dressed everybody up in ridiculous costumes and made them have sex.
That's the only way this could work.
It's scary, but it's the only feasible way this could possibly work.
Not sure if want.
We reached out to Atari for comment on the Pac-Man movie and this is all they had to say.
Too bad it's Namco that's gonna be taking care of that.
My theory... It's a joke from like three weeks ago.
I know, it is.
That was for the fans.
Wow, I missed the bus.
Yeah, I missed the bus, sorry.
What?
I feel it's going to be CG.
Probably.
I feel it's going to be poop.
It's going to be a pooped out rubber band.
You know what?
You need to take that toilet paper joke book...
Turn it upside down and turn that front.
SSJ100Matt says that Jessica Alba should be Mrs. Pac-Man, but that makes me think that all games Jessica, if she doesn't get the role in that horror movie, she should make Ms.
Pac-Man her next goal.
Come on, I'm only recycling your material.
Come on, if she doesn't win that, don't you think she's suffered enough?
I don't know.
All right.
More news, please.
Can I have news?
No, you can't.
You can have... Okay.
Well, for people who give a shit, and I'm not one of them, Postal's coming to Blu-ray in August.
Postal is that movie made by... What's his name?
Who did a bunch of shitty movies?
Uwe Boll!
Yeah, he sucks.
Sadly enough, I have this pre-ordered already.
You do? !
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm sorry, what?
It grossed less than $5 million.
Well, it's only in four theaters.
It grossed less than $5.
How did it even make $5 million?
It shows not $5,000.
Well, first off, it just came out, I mean, literally this week.
We wish it would go back.
I don't know, I'd see it.
But, see, because this looks actually semi-interesting to me.
I've watched an UiBowl movie before, the Blood Rain 2 movie.
Interesting premise, execution was shit.
Loki, you're part of the problem.
Hey, I had to watch it in order to talk to UiBowl, okay?
We interviewed him.
That was fun.
You're part of the reason he keeps making this shit.
Hey, I didn't actually pay you to see this movie.
It was a screener.
But yeah, I get to talk to him.
It's cool.
He's making a game, too, by the way.
It's Tunnel Rat.
Hooray.
No, it's about these guys that are in Vietnam, and they go into the... Oh, dude, Tunnel Rat was the name of the G.I.
Joe.
Yeah, probably named for the same reason, but... Yeah.
I don't know.
Talk about another movie that's going to suck.
I was trying to see how much Postal made over the weekend, but it's not even on the top ten.
Surprise.
I'm trying to think where you would go to see that.
I looked at Box Office Mojo.
I couldn't find it.
But I'm looking now for the Rotten Tomatoes score.
11% on Rotten Tomatoes for Postal.
IMDB sometimes has the...
I'm looking at positive reviews for Postal.
Let's see.
Prairie Miller from Newsblaze says, Along the way to its parking lot showdown, a wacky property damage conspiracy to commit insurance fraud is uncovered between Osama and Bush.
The darker, zany recesses of America is viewed from the Twilight Zone.
Move over, Barat.
What?
Let's see.
Here's another positive review from Cam Williams.
I suppose since almost seven years have passed since 9-11, America might finally be ready to laugh at the tragedy.
Tasteless, profane, and far-fetched, but undeniably funny, too.
Hmm.
Dot, dot, dot.
That's all I have to say.
Film threat, Jeremy Knox.
It's not perfect, and will get on the nerves of the more opinionated critics out there, but it's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.
Those are the three positive reviews, giving it 11% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
I do have to admit, the poster is pretty funny.
I mean, it's offensive, it's highly offensive, but it's mildly amusing.
LucasArts, Activision, and NVIDIA
or Activision Blizzard, which I still don't understand why they're still referring to them as two different companies.
But whatever.
And it's unclear what their decision, why they decided to drop out of the ESA, but we do know that they're gone.
So apparently... One more out the door.
Interesting.
Any theories why this is happening, Loki?
I don't know.
Maybe they just don't feel like ESA is representing them enough.
Or maybe they're just getting cheap and they don't want to pay the money to the ESA to help defend them.
And besides, I mean, think about it this way.
It's like they're defending the game industry, okay?
And anybody that's joined up with the ESA has to pay them to defend the game industry.
Well, if you drop out of the ESA, they're still defending you.
So it's like you're getting a free ride.
Robin Chat says the ESA business seems to be the beginning of a new consortium.
I don't know, it sounded pretty gay to me.
Why did you say that?
I mean, they're just freeloading on this shit.
Well, that's just my opinion on why they're, I mean, it makes perfect business sense if, you know, okay, well I can eliminate this cost and they're still doing the work for me, so, as unethical as it is, eh, whatever.
Well, speaking of things that are pretty gay, Xbox Live has been going on a banning marathon lately.
A couple of bannings recently have caught some attention.
The Gayer Gamer was a gamer tag that got banned recently.
Also, this gamer tag got banned.
Richard Gaywood was a gamer tag that got banned.
And you might be thinking, ha ha ha, Gaywood.
There's actually a street near here.
It's Gaywood Street.
Dick Gaywood.
Here's the thing.
His name is really Richard Gaywood.
His parents apparently hate him.
No, that's the last name.
You don't get to pick your last name.
There's actually a scan of his driver's license up on the internet.
His name was Richard Gaywood.
Now, why you would want to use your name as your gamer tag is beyond me.
But granted, did Xbox...
Overreact.
Some gay-themed websites chimed in on this.
LesbianGamer said, I've taken a few deep breaths, run this story over in my mind again and again, and yet still return to the same annoying factor.
Why does gay automatically equate to sex or of asexual nature and carry with it such negative and deviant overtones?
I can understand Microsoft is trying to protect users, but perhaps there needs to be some tabled debate as to what they're protecting whom from and what they're perpetuating in the process.
linking gay to some negative or sexually explicit content merely fans of fires of homophobia.
Gay Gamer said this, I'm somewhat on the fence with the issue having played many MMORPGs and seeing the many annoying and disturbing names that can come from the idle minds on the internets and it seems as if Microsoft is putting up the normal we can't make exceptions defense.
All of this however is greatly outweighed by the fact that it is given name and despite the connotations it may carry with it he lives with that name every day.
and I'm sure you've probably been wondering what I, the gay host of Orange Lawn Radio have to say on this subject and honestly, you want my honest opinion on this subject?
We have much bigger things to worry about in life than this.
for instance they are going to try and overturn the recent gay marriage thing that was passed in the state of California by the Supreme Court finally have allowed gay marriage to happen in the state in less than 30 days and the crazies are going to try and put it on the November ballot and according to recent polls 54% of Californians would vote for it
to overturn gay marriage.
Because, yeah, suddenly you're going to let gays marry and there's going to be like this just sudden fuckwave going through the state and everybody's going to start fucking everywhere because that's what happens when you let gays get married.
Next thing you know, cats will marry dogs and up is down.
Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
Stupid.
So, you know what I have to say?
The hell with Xbox Live.
It's their service.
They can do whatever they want.
I mean, yeah, it's a little asinine, but whatever.
Rob, I have a question.
We have more important things to worry about right now.
Yes.
If gay marriage is allowed, wouldn't that, like, lower the amount of gay sex that's happening?
You know, because once you get married, you stop having sex.
Yeah, it really would.
She has a point.
So, you know, that would be good for the, you know, the right wing if, you know, gay marriage was allowed.
Welcome to the Olive Garden Roundtable.
That, and there would be a lot more economic growth for all of the gay men registering.
I loved what Ellen said.
I'm sorry to get political on this show but for obvious reasons this is something I feel very, very strongly and it won't be the last time I say something about it.
It's a deal.
Do you see any of us protesting?
No, I know, I know.
But I love what Ellen said to John McCain is that she said something about she compared it to and it's really like this is that you say there's two chairs over there and you can sit in one but you can't sit in the other.
Why not?
You just can't.
That's what it feels like.
Think about it.
All right.
That's it.
I am against chair marriage as well.
That's just wrong.
What would we do without you?
I honestly, I think that the best, one of the best, and I'm sure a lot of people know by now I'm a big fan of the show Bullshit.
Watch the episode about gay marriage and polyamory.
Seriously.
Thank God for the youth of America.
Because I seriously think I'm probably preaching to the choir most people of this show.
I mean, I know we have tons and tons of heterosexual people that listen to this show that probably listen to this and go, what's the big freaking deal?
That's what we're saying.
That's all we're saying.
What's the big freaking deal?
Because people have the religious corncob up their ass.
That's a lot less comfortable than other things to be up their ass.
I'll tell you what.
There's a million other things we're going to hell for before gay marriage.
I'll tell you that.
Anyhow, moving on.
Please get me off my political tangent.
I'll kick the soapbox out from under you.
Well, how about we speak of our common nemesis that we have with the rest of the video game community.
Everyone can agree, no matter what.
Everyone can agree.
He who shall not be named.
That this guy's a moron.
I'm gonna say his name so that I can read this headline, which is wonderful.
Jack Thompson, guilty man, 27 of 31 misconduct charges recommended by judge.
There's a lovely picture under this on the Destructoid article.
You said his name.
This is karma, you dump it, you drink it.
Lovely.
Lovely.
Yeah, um, so basically, um, dude is on, uh, dude's guilty for fucking up.
Did Jack Thompson jump up and go, objection!
No, because he's not that cute.
Overruled, bitch.
I, the day that he is completely, um, what's the word, disbarred?
I am going to...
What's something awesome?
Dude, when Jack Thompson is disbarred, I might dress up as Tingle.
Do it!
Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!
Shit.
No, he just said he might.
No, they're having the results of the disbarring trial on June 4th, so it is, you know, like... I didn't say I would, I said I might.
Yes, you did, you said you would.
I said I might.
No takes and bansies.
What did his June 4th fall on?
We will be live on Wednesday, June 4th.
No, I'm kidding.
If they let us.
We will record live.
Where would I get a Tingle outfit?
Where would I even get that?
Ranma would send one to you.
Okay, you know what?
What?
You'll bring back Dr. Dick.
We'll see.
Or Mr. Spanky.
There will be celebration of some sort happening when Lord Voldemort is disbarred.
I think that's... And on top of that, we need to send a letter to Ice Cube.
Wiki this, please.
Why?
No, it wasn't Ice Cube, it was Ice T. Why?
Because Fuckhead got him back in the 90s for his album, remember?
Oh, yes.
Because his big thing was music.
And then he moved from music to video games.
All this guy wants is to have the world lick his ass.
Not kiss it, lick it.
Licking is far more disgusting.
All right.
We're going to be opening up the Skype line very soon.
Let's pay Paula Terry to do that.
Well, it sounds just like her singing.
1-877-GAME-OLR But first, one more story that's not about Lord Voldemort or tingle dressing.
Yes, and this is not a bad story, actually.
There's going to be some Japanese songs that may be hitting rock band very soon, actually.
Apparently, a Harmonix developer told Joystick during Rock Band's party in New York City that they will be seeing some Japanese rock music in the games.
Apparently, there should be an announcement coming soon, but who knows?
Maybe some stuff like TM Revolution, Malice Miser...
Outro Music
But Basewolf is dead.
Did they replace... Gacked, maybe.
Bees, definitely.
There you go.
They probably have Smop or something.
Listen, this is what Activision needs to do, okay?
If you want to make an actual game that's going to be something that stands out from all these other music games out there, you make the official Guitar Wolf game.
You have it be an action game with music playing in it as well.
Zombies.
with zombies and you fight zombies with your awesome guitar skills.
Ooh, this is a good game here.
So you would fight zombies with your guitar and you're a Japanese rock star.
It'd probably, though, have, like...
Bumper Chicken
I was wondering where that was.
It's in my house.
Oh, okay.
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We only have time for a couple calls tonight, so we're going to try to keep this short and keep the calls short, too.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, hey, hey.
It's now level 30 DJ Ranma S. It's not Zaku.
Why level 30 Ranma S?
I just served my big level 30 this past weekend, and I am sober.
Congrats.
Whoa.
Oh, you are having the same birthday that I'm having next month.
Oh, yeah.
Well, congrats to you.
Congrats on your ding, man.
Thank you.
What else is on your mind besides that you're old?
I finally got my Xbox 360.
Ooh, what'd you think?
I kind of wish I'd gotten it soon, but I'm pretty happy with it.
And I have to thank Loki because he's been randy about Saints Row and Crackdown.
I actually picked him up.
they're like dirt cheap now so yeah and I'm enjoying it Crackdown is really Crackdown is a great game what made you finally what finally broke you into getting an Xbox 360 what was it that finally made you go yes I need this because between because we already have a Wii in the house and what's left is the PS3 and Xbox 360 and there's one thing that the Xbox 360 has that the PS3 does not which is games that I'd actually play there you have it
Rumble Roses XX Bioshock 32 inch
Oh yeah.
Very sexy.
So we'll have to jam on Rock Band sometime.
Add me to your friends list.
I think I have room.
I may not.
I don't know.
I hope so because I will go check it and I did download Yaris while y'all was on break.
Wow.
What'd you think?
I haven't played it yet but this is the way I look at it.
Free game is free.
Free game is free but free game is also a bit of a waste of time.
What are you laughing at?
I'm sorry.
DarkSakura's being very distracting tonight because she's laughing at something.
She's showing us this YouTube video of a flying penis.
I saw that, that was funny.
Remember the penis age in Second Life?
This is real life.
That is so stupid, and you guys are like laughing.
How old are you?
How old are you?
Five?
Six?
It has to do with gaming.
Is it a chess champion speech?
I thought it was, yeah, they had that on Best Week Ever.
I'm sorry, Ranma, for that.
Is there anything else you wanted to share besides the flying penis copter, as SackDeft calls it?
No comment.
Alright, take care, Ranma.
Alright, bye.
Bye.
Stop distracting this show with your flying penises.
Hi, you're on Orange Fonz Radio.
Who's this?
It's GS68.
GS68, what is on your mind, my friend?
Do you have a flying penis?
I am.
It's anime.
Wait, are you at Fonime right now?
Yep.
Hey, you gotta get some noise.
Are you in the middle of a crowd or something?
Um...
Actually, no, I'm in the main area.
You're in the main area?
Are there like tons of people walking through there?
Over by the hall with the meeting rooms.
Dude, make a beeline to the vendor hall and make some noise for Orange Challenge Radio.
Yeah, you gotta make some noise for Orange Challenge Radio.
Alright, that's alright.
What, what, um, what, how's it going this year?
How is Fandomay?
What are we missing out on?
Um, it's, um, let's see.
This is a gaming room and a dealer's room, for better or for worse.
Hmm.
Have there been any awesome panels this year to make up for the loss of Orange Lounge Radio?
There's Banzai Arcade, which is basically a game show where you have a video game trigger and sometimes you're challenged to do a fantastic video game like 25 rings inside the hedgehog or beat the final boss of Sonic 2.
Interesting.
It sounds like you're having fun.
What are some of the craziest cosplays you've seen while you've been there?
Let's see.
Let me think.
There's this one mecha cosplay.
I forgot his name, but he had some lights on his outfit.
It was pretty cool.
I went to the hentai room for the heck of it.
It was hilarious.
Like, usually, I was doing, like, handshakes, and people were like...
and the freaking stuff they were showing.
Well, it sounds like you're having fun and you're going to continue to throughout the rest of the weekend.
So I'm sorry we didn't make it this year, but are there any OLR listeners that you've run into?
Unfortunately, I appear to be the only one that I know of.
Aw, sadness.
Some of the staff listens to our show.
I know they do.
They're all closet fans.
So...
I like the grassroots effort to get the ULR name out there.
Very well done.
Yeah.
I also had a Yoda over Circle Flasher logo, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think first day I had it in my back shoulder because I got an oversized back shoulder.
Like, it's big enough to carry a little card under my badge.
Oh, very cool.
We should make little somethings for people that go to anime conventions.
Ooh, I should look into that, like little stickers or something people can wear.
I was outside to check out the anime masquerade last night.
I didn't really like it.
Like, a lot of kids, like...
They tried too hard with the voice acting so it ends up sounding cheesy and horrible and there are too many like dance skits like too many people doing that freaking har har yukai dance.
I mean... It's still good.
I suppose.
But they're pretty awesome Mortal Versus Capcom skits where they replicated one of the... I think we used Shinko Hadouken Attack.
Like they replicated that with like...
and Wallace Delafade, which was pretty awesome.
It looked like a laser, I guess.
Mel B, our buddy Mel B, our buddy
I don't really know him.
Oh, well, he knows OLR.
Oh, I see.
All right.
We've got to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but have fun.
All right.
Run around, act crazy.
All right.
Take care.
See you around.
A call direct from Faname.
That's kind of cool.
I like these whole little live reports we're getting.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is SSJ100Matt.
Well, hello, SSJ100Matt, the winner of the OLR contest from a couple weeks ago for the GTA 4 console.
And we heard that you got at least one vote from another show, so that's good.
I know, it's awesome.
Things are looking good.
So what's up, buddy?
Nothing much.
Well, you know, I just wanted to call in.
I wanted to thank everyone who voted on my entry.
That would be everyone, SSJ100Matt.
you really kind of kicked butt in that competition you did a great job well yeah because you know I felt guilty because I know you guys called but I was on the road I was on a cross country trip we edited it out of the podcast they'll never know so but yeah I just wanted to thank everyone and it sounded like the all games people liked it and Scott and Mary Young and Jessica all liked it yes in the end they didn't vote for you but I think it's because they didn't get it
I hope you win, we're pulling for you We'll let you know, we're supposed to hear this week So we'll let you know
All right.
We're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get more calls.
Take care.
Okay.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
This is J100 Matt, who is our finalist in the Grand Theft Auto.
One of eight in the freaking world being made.
It's amazing.
Last-minute stories, Loki.
Do you have any?
Yeah.
There's apparently another WiiWare game that's coming, I guess, pretty soon.
And...
It's a WiiWare game called Last Flight, and apparently the game has to do with vampires on a plane.
I guess you are a culinary vampire hunter.
Culinary vampire hunter.
Players will have the option of playing, I guess, Anna, a Romanian who is on the same plane back to Europe and is on a mission to destroy her vampire father.
All right.
This game sounds awesome.
We're going to take one more call before we go tonight.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Scott, you missed ASUN.
I did miss Asen.
I'm kind of sad, but I definitely want to go next year.
Wait, who is this?
This is Osfer.
Osfer.
Well, how was Asen?
We just had a report on Faname.
How was Asen?
Well, it was my very first convention, and it was a freaking blast.
Uh-huh.
Well... If you went to Artist Alley, you would have run into our official lesbians.
If you saw two girls, one with blue hair, you would have ran into them.
Oh, crap.
You gotta have blue hair.
I can't remember.
I had orange hair.
Yeah, wait here.
I'll post a link in chat so I have the pictures from it.
I saw Misty.
Yeah, I was in line for the Hal Kelly concert, and she walked by and she had her Pikachu hat on.
I'm like, hey, but she couldn't stick around because she didn't want to hold up the line.
Right.
Well, that's still pretty cool.
Oh my gosh, there's like an entire album of stuff.
Yeah, some of them are videos, too.
One of them is me with my orange hair on.
I'm doing part of the Har Har Yukai dance.
Wait, are you dressed up as someone?
Yeah.
Well, in one of them, I'm supposed to be Ichigo, but I didn't get the full outfit, so I'm just supposed to be him in a school uniform.
Then in another one, I'm standing next to my friend, who he was cosplaying Kenshin, and I'm supposed to be Kion from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
Huh.
I'm trying to figure out if this is you.
We're trying to look at the pictures here.
Oh, yeah, that looks like orangey hair.
That's probably him right there.
All right.
Very cool.
It sounds like you have fun.
Was there just like tons and tons of people there?
Well, yeah.
Isn't that like the fourth biggest convention in the United States or something like that?
That is an awesome Pyramid Head outfit.
Look at that.
That's hot.
Did you see that Pyramid Head cosplay?
I don't know if you're looking at the same one.
I looked at the pictures earlier.
Ah, very hot.
So, what gaming related things did you see there real quick?
Well, I didn't really get to play much because there was like huge lines for all the games.
But I mean, of course, there was like a huge station with all these like classic fighters like Street Fighter and just like
It goes on and on.
And then there's Brawl, of course.
For the arcade stuff, they had Beatmania 6 style, I think.
And then they have the new one, Gold.
But I didn't really get to play that because something was wrong with the 6 mix machine.
I put it in my quarters and they ripped me off.
I was just like, dang it.
But they had an in-the-group 2 machine.
But I think it had R21 or something because...
It had this whole opening preview video.
It said over 4,500 songs.
I'm just like, holy shit.
Yeah, somebody probably installed a hack on it.
Yeah.
Something, but oh my God, it was huge.
And then they had DDR Extreme, Pump It Up.
Yeah.
Sounds like fun.
All right, well, buddy, we're going to let you go, but I'm glad to hear your first con was a success, and yeah, we'll try to make it next year.
We definitely want to have a panel and all that.
Well, I don't know if we can all go, but those of us that can, we'll do something, so
Yeah, I'm already planning to go to OhioCon next.
Awesome.
Oh, now you're addicted.
All right, well, have fun.
All right, thanks.
Take care.
All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
We've got to start wrapping up the show.
Any other last-minute stories, Loki?
Yeah.
Let's see.
Other than the vampires on the plane stuff, there is a certain game that is being rumored to coming out in August.
It also begins with an A. The game...
is rumored to be coming to stores in August.
Apparently this is coming from PlayAsia, who has the game listed for August 28th.
And apparently they got the date early before on Initial D's special stage, so they're saying maybe it's possible.
I haven't heard anything, so I don't know.
Maybe.
and then for those of you who emulate your games on your PC EPSXE 1.70 has finally been released after about 4 years of no updates there and now they've added a bunch of support now multiple changes done to the pad support some more ISO support code being rewritten and apparently a lot more games are now compatible with it so that's pretty cool
and let's see here I was going to say also there's a website the slobsofgaming.com they have since we're talking about anime conventions here the 11 most scorching hot female cosplayers ever and you can check that out slobsofgaming.com and I'll copy that in the chat room as well
and let's see Duke Nukem 3D has now been converted to work on the PSP Slim so if you have your PSP Slim hacked in with homebrew ready software running on it you can now play Duke Nukem 3D which is pretty awesome
Infinite Undiscovery, the Square Enix game coming out on the Xbox 360 has been announced for a worldwide release on September 2nd so that looks pretty cool and Sam & Max Season 3 are going to be coming early 2009 Telltale is still interested in putting the games out on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network so hopefully we'll see those soon and I don't remember if we mentioned this earlier but
Carameldansen
Pack there, you get Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, Just What I Needed, I'm In Touch With Your World, Don't Just Stop, You're All I've Got, Bye Bye Love, Moving in Stereo, and All Mixed Up.
So that's it.
About the Actraiser thing too, it was just basically, he's criticizing, I'd like to make an Actraiser sequel, that would be kind of fun.
It would be fun, do it.
It's super fun.
It'd be a lot of fun.
It came up when discussing WiiWare stuff.
God, I hope it's true.
Alright, we're going to put the nail in the coffin of this show now.
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
First off, Tiara, thank you so much for being here tonight and being a presence here on the show.

A double happy birthday, first of all, to Tiara.
