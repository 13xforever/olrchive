00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:05,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast on May 11th, 2008.

2
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:11,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mother's Day, so if you forgot, you definitely owe your mother like a big bouquet of flowers.

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:15,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should definitely call her if you haven't already.

4
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:20,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, whatever motherly figure is in your life because, you know, some single parents and so on.

5
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:23,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody necessarily has a mom, but call somebody and tell them you love them.

6
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:24,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it, love is in the air.

7
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:32,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, myself, DarkSakura, Loki, here with you on Orange Lounge Radio Part B. We're about to get back to some news, but first, we have some business to take care of.

8
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:47,115
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest, which we're working with AllGames.com to give away a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite Grand Theft Auto IV.

9
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:48,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

10
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:09,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix

11
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:45,677
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back, and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.

12
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:54,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts, like Rob Roberts.

13
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:00,981
[SPEAKER_07]: When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer, I'm down on my knees.

14
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm staying in.

15
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:08,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.

16
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:09,254
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura?

17
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:20,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a boat fire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.

18
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:20,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

19
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:24,120
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.

20
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get strung out by the way I look.

21
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:31,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't judge a book by its cover.

22
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:32,844
[SPEAKER_01]: John DMN Bresler.

23
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:34,245
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever go to Duck Island?

24
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mom goes to Duck Island.

25
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:43,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and Laura Steele UT don't want you to hear.

26
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:49,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.

27
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:52,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution's second mix.

28
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:57,648
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.

29
00:02:57,788 --> 00:03:04,192
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting, FUCK.

30
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:07,753
[SPEAKER_04]: See, he says at the end there, not guaranteed, Loki, that you will in fact dress up as Tingle.

31
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:10,294
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still implying, though, that it was sales of...

32
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,581
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there it is.

33
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:33,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats, SSJ100Matt.

34
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,164
[SPEAKER_06]: But a big round of applause, everybody, please, to our finalists.

35
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,225
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all very good.

36
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody that participated, we couldn't play them all in the final round.

37
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:42,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I get two claps.

38
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, good job, you guys.

39
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,329
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one more than you got for your mount.

40
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:45,109
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you.

41
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's the thing, though.

42
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have to all throw our support behind SSJ100Matt as he moves into the final round, because I'll tell you what.

43
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:58,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a bunch of OLR in-jokes, you know when they play that on All Games Interactive or however they decide to do the final.

44
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,260
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that are going to listen to that and go, what?

45
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,961
[SPEAKER_06]: The hell is that?

46
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:03,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't get it.

47
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:11,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So we all have to support SSJ100Matt now by making sure in the final voting phase we all go and vote for him because we want him to win.

48
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,972
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to say that the winner came from OLR.

49
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:18,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So be sure to throw your support behind him in the finalist round.

50
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:22,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give you more information on that next week when the voting should be up.

51
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:26,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So check for that on our website as well a little later this week.

52
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,740
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

53
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So congrats, SJ100, Matt.

54
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:37,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Another giveaway to come later in the show, that res code finally going to be given away to somebody, thank God, in a new game coming up a little bit later.

55
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,047
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, more news.

56
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, let's go back to some gaming news.

57
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to watch the stock market too much, but...

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:53,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess if you were hoping that Atari was going to make a big turnaround and become this really profitable company, well, no.

59
00:04:54,298 --> 00:05:06,048
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, Nasdaq has actually delisted them from the stock exchange because they have failed to... Well, basically, they failed to submit the year-end financials.

60
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And before that, the market value was way too low.

61
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have been dropped...

62
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:17,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Drop like an American Idol contestant who just couldn't make it.

63
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Or an American Idol contestant's father from backstage.

64
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:20,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you read about that?

65
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:21,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

66
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:22,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny stuff.

67
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:23,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

68
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:26,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have more in the saga of one of the Davids?

69
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not letting this show turn into American Idol chat.

70
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:29,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Not, not, not.

71
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:34,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, apparently someone's abusive daddy, you know, a la Michael Jackson.

72
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:34,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

73
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:50,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there was a certain boo-boo, if you remember, last week with kind of doing... There was a cover of a song that he did that had the lyrics, Beautiful Girls, in it.

74
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That caused him a lot of money.

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you guys.

76
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:55,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And besides, that was cheap anyways.

77
00:05:56,002 --> 00:06:00,645
[SPEAKER_07]: That was as cheap as that one chick who was saying all the American Jesus-themed songs.

78
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:04,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so yeah, Satari got delisted from NASDAQ.

79
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:08,009
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they're just...

80
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:10,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Going down a slippery slope.

81
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:19,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully someone will buy them, and it will be a little bit more than all Dragon Ball Z Atari remake games.

82
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we reached out to Atari for comment, and this is all they had to say.

83
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:32,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad joke.

84
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:33,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's going to get it.

85
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:34,292
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

86
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Chirp, chirp.

87
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:36,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a shot.

88
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,531
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet

89
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:04,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about new and exciting games as opposed to games that were out like 20 years ago.

90
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,725
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet will be coming out in October.

91
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:13,026
[SPEAKER_06]: This was announced at the PlayStation Day 2008 event in London.

92
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from Kazurai himself.

93
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:19,988
[SPEAKER_06]: He has confirmed that LittleBigPlanet is going to be making its way in October.

94
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:24,969
[SPEAKER_06]: But one thing you should be aware of is that the open beta, not happening.

95
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you were looking forward to the public beta that was promised several times for the game, nope, the public beta is going away.

96
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So surprised.

97
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a promise broken by Sony.

98
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully there will be a demo or something, but don't hold your breath.

99
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,197
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll probably just have to wait for the game to come out.

100
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:44,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just add another check mark on the board there.

101
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:46,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

102
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,900
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

103
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But LittleBigPlanet will be making its way in October, unless it gets delayed again.

104
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:52,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Who never knows?

105
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be all sorts of awesome whenever it comes out.

106
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:55,785
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

107
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:21,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for things that are to be coming out, as mentioned, is Home, which has been pushed back, pushed back, turned around, upside down, set on fire, and dropped in said underwater volcano, is going to be getting a fall release, which has been told us by SCEE President David Reeves, and said...

108
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

109
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:45,645
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's not quite as prestigious as, say, Home.

110
00:08:45,765 --> 00:09:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is actually homeless, and you can find yourself participating in wonderful activities like sleeping on a park bench, spewing out obscenities, talking to a wall, and just not being cared for.

111
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:06,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I need to do a quick poll in chat right now.

112
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick poll in chat.

113
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,597
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, which joke was funnier?

114
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:15,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's homeless joke or Rob's Atari joke?

115
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Place vote now in chat.

116
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:22,042
[SPEAKER_06]: In the main chat room.

117
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, it's funnier.

118
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Which joke was funnier?

119
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funnier?

120
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:26,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's show.

121
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:29,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's show is hilarious.

122
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilarious.

123
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:31,710
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

124
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:33,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, go to the next story.

125
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:36,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you guys.

126
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:37,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, wait.

127
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:38,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

128
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,768
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the quick poll results are in.

129
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's Atari joke.

130
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:42,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's joke.

131
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:42,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari.

132
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:43,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

133
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:43,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

134
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:44,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's Atari joke.

135
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:44,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's.

136
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:45,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's Atari joke.

137
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Rob used the Atari Pac-Man dying sound.

138
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

139
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's Atari joke.

140
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:50,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

141
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:51,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

142
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

143
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:52,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I rock.

144
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

145
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:54,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you, Loki.

146
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:57,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So this isn't a big surprise.

147
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,361
[SPEAKER_07]: There's rumors now that Daxter and Wipeout Pulse are going to be ported to the PS2.

148
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:01,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

149
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,621
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP games are being ported to the PS2?

150
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:05,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a first.

151
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:13,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is coming from Jukes Video France, and they're just stating that, of course, those two games are being ported to the PS2.

152
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:17,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say that's a pretty safe guess, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it.

153
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a big surprise.

154
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:26,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so now we gotta downgrade our games to get them to sell more.

155
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:27,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that basically what this is?

156
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:31,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing too, is when they port them over, they don't enhance any of the graphics or anything.

157
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:36,926
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I believe Ratchet & Clank Size Matters didn't look that good on the PS2.

158
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Twisted Metal, pretty cool.

159
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill Origins, pretty cool.

160
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:44,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But just, I don't know.

161
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:46,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need his stinking vote.

162
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,768
[SPEAKER_07]: or his friendship on the PlayStation Network.

163
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:25,307
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

164
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

165
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

166
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:11,456
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing about Project Gotham for me is that it's a little heavy on the car shop and tuning your car and stuff.

167
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to play a really easy pick-up-and-race type game like F-Zero.

168
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why I like F-Zero and Mario Kart.

169
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:17,821
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really easy.

170
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:19,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it easy and fast.

171
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:21,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I like F-Zero.

172
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you get to drive so fast.

173
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:28,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously still say F-Zero GX is one of my favorite racing games ever.

174
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:29,652
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.

175
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:30,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

176
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see, though, what Bizarre has in store for us.

177
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:41,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, they might just try something completely new out of left field that's going to make me go, da-da-da-da-da, want.

178
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Might you say that, DarkSakura?

179
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:45,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Da-da-da-da-want.

180
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:48,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

181
00:12:49,722 --> 00:13:18,708
[SPEAKER_04]: well speaking of stuff that came through via conference call how's that for tie-in it was actually stated by Activision Publishing CEO Mike Griffith that Guitar Hero has surpassed 15 million in individual song downloads so I guess rock bands got a little bit more to catch up with but then again Guitar Hero has been out longer so

182
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:24,069
[SPEAKER_04]: In shorter time, Harmonix hit 10 million.

183
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:32,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that look at it in perspective of time and then see who's doing better.

184
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:33,238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I say.

185
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I sense a little bit of favoritism on your part.

186
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:39,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially since Rock Band already had to deal with Guitar Heroes.

187
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

188
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:43,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm setting up for something later.

189
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:44,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pay attention to that.

190
00:13:45,083 --> 00:14:02,812
[SPEAKER_04]: since um since Guitar Hero was already out and already had a loyal fan base when Rock Band came out so to hit 10 million after all that I think Rock Band's got and I'm looking at this just by terms of numbers and time that I think Rock Band's the more impressive hmm

191
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:04,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I don't know.

192
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:10,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero, I still like it because I think it's more fun to play guitar on Guitar Hero than it is on Rock Band.

193
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But Rock Band's definitely the better part of the game.

194
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hitting things.

195
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:14,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that shit.

196
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about guitar freaks.

197
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:16,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you guys...

198
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Guitar Freaks is kind of... No, Guitar Freaks!

199
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:22,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your loyalty?

200
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:23,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I defected.

201
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I still love Beatmania 2DX.

202
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And Keyboard Mania.

203
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I will always have a soft, squishy spot in my heart for Keyboard Mania.

204
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:38,020
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, completely unrelated, and Loki, when you mentioned it, I had to look it up, and I think that's the most hilarious thing I've ever heard.

205
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,721
[SPEAKER_04]: For the American Idol thing.

206
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

207
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:46,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop derailing the show with your idle chat.

208
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's only a few more weeks and then it's over.

209
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:50,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I don't believe this.

210
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:52,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the reality TV whore of you three.

211
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I am hosting a freaking Survivor game on LiveJournal right now.

212
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:59,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a whore I am for reality TV.

213
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's you two that derail me.

214
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I explained the other night this isn't reality TV.

215
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a talent contest.

216
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,370
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference.

217
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bunch of people acting like retards.

218
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see anything into their personal life on the show.

219
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:13,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I like people acting like retards.

220
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,078
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't have a point.

221
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a contest.

222
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:16,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a contest.

223
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not looking at how these people are living in their daily lives.

224
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank God for that.

225
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:21,344
[SPEAKER_04]: They just...

226
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:42,431
[SPEAKER_07]: interview them you're not following them as they're trying to build a hut out of coconut leaves wouldn't it be more fun if the idols did have to build no no no no because you see this is why I don't watch any of the results show and I just read the winner online because I don't like watching tons of Ford commercials being you know their little musical numbers

227
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have not watched a physical episode on TV this year.

228
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:51,161
[SPEAKER_06]: All I have to say is I'm missing the Survivor Micronesia finale tonight to be here.

229
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you spoil it in chat, I will punch you in the face and it will hurt.

230
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:56,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got TiVo.

231
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:58,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but still.

232
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,111
[SPEAKER_04]: You have TiVo.

233
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:02,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I have YouTube on my phone at work.

234
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

235
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:29,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's rumors now that Activision is partnering with Nintendo to release Nintendo DS bundles that will include the DS system as well as Guitar Hero on Tour.

236
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be the first third-party kind of combo pack that they've done with the DS so far.

237
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat, whoring the game out a bit.

238
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:41,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I guess.

239
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:54,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I would say that you would need the black and red, or crimson black DS, so it would look pretty cool with this, but I don't know, it's neat, I guess.

240
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:07,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, what was I going to say, I think that they're doing, I think Guitar Hero 4 is coming out in DS too, so you're not going to have to worry about just playing on tour for a long time.

241
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they really going to move that many DS units with this one game?

242
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to sell pretty well.

243
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:20,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's innovative, I guess.

244
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:21,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's innovative, I guess.

245
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:25,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's an interesting peripheral, let me put it that way.

246
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:27,718
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

247
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:28,558
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

248
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:33,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's an original idea at all because the WonderSwan had the Beatmania wheel.

249
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:35,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Scratch table.

250
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:37,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is different.

251
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:38,596
[SPEAKER_04]: This is much different.

252
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:42,457
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been games that's had add-ons of a similar nature.

253
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:53,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that add-ons... I think it's an interesting add-on because I know one, like, I'm thinking Guitar Hero for the DS before they ever showed off this, you know, guitar grip thing.

254
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking you tap in the screen, you know, to be the music type thing.

255
00:17:57,581 --> 00:18:00,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is definitely a lot better than that.

256
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:01,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

257
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Be interesting to see what they do with it.

258
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,130
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

259
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:32,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

260
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:53,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

261
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Something tells me there will be some type of instrument we haven't thought of yet that's going to be in it somehow.

262
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on, Rob.

263
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:03,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the Wii, okay, and the Wii Wheel when they made that announcement.

264
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:11,011
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big step in innovation to them, despite the fact that there had been third-party games that had done that since the Wii launch.

265
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:12,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's retarded.

266
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:18,356
[SPEAKER_07]: They just, you know, pat themselves on the back and stuff, you know, fluff themselves, I don't know what.

267
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just, it's retarded.

268
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:21,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

269
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Guitar Hero 4, we'll see.

270
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get more news on it later, I guess.

271
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:33,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure we'll be shocked and awed.

272
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:35,374
[SPEAKER_06]: But not really.

273
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:37,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we already kind of figured it out.

274
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we shocked and awed?

275
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:39,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

276
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:40,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we just going, aww?

277
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:41,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

278
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:46,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what else should be getting some downloadable content?

279
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:46,418
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

280
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:47,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

281
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:49,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Samba de Amigo.

282
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And we?

283
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you mean downloadable content on the Wii?

284
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:55,853
[SPEAKER_06]: How is this possible?

285
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain yourself.

286
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:08,419
[SPEAKER_04]: They were taking a look at the cover for Samba de Amigo and at the top is Wii's Pay to Play logo.

287
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be indicative of some downloadable content.

288
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:15,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay to Play.

289
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:43,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are my maracas?

290
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:48,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some third-party company will put out cheap plastic maraca cases for your... Maraca attachment.

291
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:48,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

292
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:50,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

293
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:52,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my maracas and I want to pose.

294
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:53,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, I'm just going to bust out.

295
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the posing will be there.

296
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:55,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I want maracas.

297
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We could develop our own maraca attachment.

298
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:58,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

299
00:20:58,203 --> 00:20:59,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you anything because the...

300
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: The space on the Wii is so limited.

301
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:06,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you anything it is not pay to download content.

302
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,372
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pay to unlock content.

303
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:09,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Because why not?

304
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:11,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It's working on the 360 with games like Katamari.

305
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:15,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to stop referring to these things as downloadable content and call them what they are.

306
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,039
[SPEAKER_06]: You are paying to unlock something already on the disc.

307
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,021
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, though, I don't know if that might be the case.

308
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, this stuff could be like MP3 format or something very similar.

309
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,905
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not actually making the music to the game.

310
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going along with it.

311
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:27,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

312
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:29,949
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dreamcast ones were actually downloadable.

313
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Samba 2000

314
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Samba de Amigo Samba de Amigo

315
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:17,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, while we're waiting for actual download content on the Wii, whether...

316
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Samba de Amigo is going to be the first one or not.

317
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:29,925
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, though, in July, we are going to be getting something not quite downloadable, but expanding on with Rock Band Track Pack Volume 1.

318
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming to the PlayStation 2 and the Wii.

319
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: What's kind of neat about this game, actually, it's not really adding on to the game.

320
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:40,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's almost like its own game.

321
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,169
[SPEAKER_07]: It has its own songs.

322
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:44,330
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a list of about...

323
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:48,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say there's 10-15 tracks there.

324
00:22:49,485 --> 00:23:03,872
[SPEAKER_07]: All stuff that's currently available on Xbox Live, Arcade, and PlayStation Network like 30 Seconds to Mars, The Kill, Blink-182, all the small things, Kiss, Calling Dr. Love, and so on.

325
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:09,654
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't own Rock Band, you can just buy this for $29.99 if you want.

326
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it will contain 20 songs.

327
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:14,555
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

328
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:23,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

329
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:45,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well.

330
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:47,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could just pay to download the songs.

331
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:48,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could just do that.

332
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:55,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, or if you own a PlayStation 2 and a Wii, or a Wii, I guess, you don't really have the option.

333
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:56,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Nintendo.

334
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's some more rock band news.

335
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:09,916
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of interesting this week, and it has to do with more rock band tracks, but this time it's free tracks, and we like free, but it's kind of the way that you get them, which is very interesting.

336
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:18,240
[SPEAKER_06]: The band Disturbed, apparently, is going to be having some tracks in rock band, and the only way you get this is by pre-ordering their latest CD, which I think is Indestructible.

337
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:18,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it's called?

338
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:25,505
[SPEAKER_06]: You pre-order the CD, and then you actually can get the songs that apparently will not be going public until June.

339
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:27,045
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

340
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: with it.

341
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:04,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's not the first time South Park would have tied into Rock Band, because think, Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld is one of the unlocked songs in the game, which is pretty awesome.

342
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's actual, like, South Park songs.

343
00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:07,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they're South Park songs, too.

344
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, DVD-A, Now You're a Man.

345
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:12,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, uh, Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucka.

346
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love some of the stuff from the movie.

347
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:14,781
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

348
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, uh, what was the song?

349
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:17,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Little Boy, You're Going to Hell.

350
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:19,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?

351
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:20,246
[SPEAKER_06]: That had a good guitar riff in it.

352
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:21,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.

353
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

354
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, in the meantime, we're going to take a little trip to our mailbag.

355
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:35,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and DarkSakura rips open the email bag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you guys.

356
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, though, it's slim pickings in the mailbag this week.

357
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like not a lot of folks emailed us.

358
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:46,357
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's going to pick her two favorite emails tonight to read for you right now.

359
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:50,781
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to email us for a future week, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

360
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:51,622
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, take it away.

361
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I did get a couple from Rob with two Bs, but I'm actually still reading over them, so I'll have to save them for next week.

362
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:01,077
[SPEAKER_04]: First one comes from Katamaris Forever.

363
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:03,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Sunday to you, OLR.

364
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so pleasant.

365
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to start my letter regarding what I wrote last week.

366
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:18,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Having copied down what Actdeft said on Part B two weeks ago, I tried removing Photo Channel, but since I didn't download it in the first place, it wasn't there to delete.

367
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also like to state that since the show reaches 1am in Michigan, I usually go live during Part A and go to sleep during the beginning of Part B. I can't thank you enough for providing podcasts through your RSS feed so that I can listen later.

368
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I would like to address a popular issue that I've seen recently in games.

369
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:37,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Their ratings.

370
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:47,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that every new release title gets to be a number one on aggregate sites like GamerKings, only to fall down to the top 30 a week later.

371
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:56,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Do exclusive reviews usually skew opinions, hence the 100% that PS3 version of Grand Theft Auto 4 is getting?

372
00:26:57,745 --> 00:27:04,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure, the first reviews usually spew out love, but it's usually the first people who influence the next, right?

373
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:11,638
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, for example, GameSpot gave a game like Okami for Wii a 9.0 when the other reviewers follow suit.

374
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's just buzz.

375
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Which brings me to my other point.

376
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Bioshock?

377
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: In a mere amount of months, the 2007 game of the year just vanished out of thin air.

378
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:31,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, I don't hear a peep about this legendary game anymore, but just who whooped who in brawl and testimonials about GTA 4.

379
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:34,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, I've got a friend who calls this game, quote, the truth.

380
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: The truth.

381
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, that ADD?

382
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:45,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Two random things I want to address Why does Rob hate Toadette?

383
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:52,634
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just the same as Toad and Mario Kart Wii is very nice but bikes seem unusable when playing with the Wii wheel

384
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:53,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario and Wario

385
00:28:14,364 --> 00:28:18,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Luigi, and Waluigi, Donkey Kong, and Diddy Kong.

386
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:40,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I continue?

387
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:41,326
[SPEAKER_06]: You may.

388
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:42,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the long letter.

389
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be sure to talk about something else next time.

390
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:45,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Katamari's forever.

391
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:53,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Change is inevitable except at the Olive Garden where endless soup, salad, and breadsticks are $9.95 every day excluding Australia LOL.

392
00:28:55,133 --> 00:29:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I love how all of our emails now have to end their email with some type of Home of the Neverending or Olive Garden reference.

393
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:00,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

394
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:03,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

395
00:29:04,258 --> 00:29:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for playing my entry for the contest on the show.

396
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad you guys liked it and said it was great.

397
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: That really means a lot to me.

398
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:17,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shame that few people are entering to win, but I guess that most people listening already own an Xbox 360 or PS3.

399
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:21,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to hear the other entries for the contest, though, so keep us informed.

400
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:26,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I've got a story for you guys about how I got to know your podcast.

401
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually looking for podcasts with lounge music.

402
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:36,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So I typed lounge podcast and something like that into Google and it led me to your website.

403
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:43,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded an episode and the beginning was like Sky's famous intro beginning with video games, video gaming, and gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

404
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Being a gamer myself, I thought, hey, I'll check this out.

405
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually laughed my ass off.

406
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was immediately hooked.

407
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:57,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it, a somewhat unusual way of getting to know you guys, but the name Orange Lounge Radio really paid off.

408
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:07,300
[SPEAKER_06]: which is funny because a lot of times I think we haven't been discovered because our title does not have game in it and people are like, what does Orange Lounge have to do with video games?

409
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:10,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just kind of funny that the reverse worked.

410
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:10,784
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ditter.

411
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:11,604
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

412
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:15,368
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Sky, you do sound like Lazlo from GTA a lot.

413
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:15,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Smile face.

414
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:18,330
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not a bad thing because he's so funny.

415
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:19,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay then.

416
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:19,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgive you.

417
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the great show.

418
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:22,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of love from Belgium.

419
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:23,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin.

420
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:31,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now, DarkSakura, it occurred to me you weren't here last week, so you didn't hear his entry, but the problem was he was ineligible.

421
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:32,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I did hear it.

422
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:32,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You did?

423
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it the week before.

424
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:34,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

425
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:36,572
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the really... Oh, you know what it was?

426
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:39,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play it on air that time you heard it.

427
00:30:39,652 --> 00:30:39,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

428
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:40,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then you've heard it.

429
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:41,353
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

430
00:30:41,693 --> 00:30:42,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

431
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:42,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

432
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,693
[SPEAKER_06]: But we played it on air last week, right?

433
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:45,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

434
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:49,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought, and you weren't here last week, so... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

435
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:49,754
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

436
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:50,494
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more.

437
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:51,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

438
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:52,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Better be short.

439
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really short.

440
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:56,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from GS68.

441
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR crew, I've got seven words for Black Wolf.

442
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,737
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have against the ferret?

443
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:03,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

444
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,941
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to ask.

445
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:07,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit him last week when you weren't here.

446
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:08,424
[SPEAKER_06]: You butt.

447
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:09,337
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know.

448
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:10,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually don't know.

449
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously don't know where the ferret is.

450
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's somewhere around here.

451
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,140
[SPEAKER_04]: He's hiding from Bobby.

452
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully I threw him away.

453
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:14,762
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

454
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:15,342
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

455
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:16,943
[SPEAKER_04]: He's hiding from Bobby.

456
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's... You traumatized the baby ferret.

457
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:30,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a little bit of rivalry between our mascot, the ferret, and Bobby, and I'm not sure who it belongs to, Bobby or Super Happy Funtime Show, but Clicky the Pen.

458
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's some type of rivalry there.

459
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:32,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Clicky the Pen.

460
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:32,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

461
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:36,139
[SPEAKER_04]: But the ferret has cuteness.

462
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, but the pen goes click.

463
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,258
[SPEAKER_04]: But the pens are also useful.

464
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:40,839
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

465
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

466
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Parrots are useful, too, because you can throw them at your co-host.

467
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:47,303
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can find it.

468
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:48,044
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

469
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:49,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you watch.

470
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:50,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find another parrot.

471
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:52,447
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

472
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:54,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the email this week.

473
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:59,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you have some emails you would like to contribute.

474
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:05,997
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've got some more gaming news, and then we are minutes away from a brand new OLR game launch.

475
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,272
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even know what it is yet.

476
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:09,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be fun.

477
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:10,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited.

478
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:12,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it will suck and we'll never play it again.

479
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happens to games.

480
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,916
[SPEAKER_06]: They're either really good or they suck and we never play them again.

481
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:16,517
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

482
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over to Loki for another story.

483
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,680
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

484
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:31,445
[SPEAKER_07]: So this isn't a big surprise because they were talking that Bazaar was going to be working on a new Bond game.

485
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:32,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Well,

486
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,299
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

487
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:03,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to see.

488
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:10,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But the film is being released in the UK on October 31st, November 7th in North America.

489
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean that we'll actually get the game then?

490
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:15,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you think we'll have to wait for the DVD?

491
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'll come out fourth.

492
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:18,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does it say third quarter?

493
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:19,739
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fourth quarter.

494
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess third quarter financial quarter, I guess, for them.

495
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:25,784
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, fourth quarter.

496
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:27,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would make sense.

497
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom 4

498
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,602
[SPEAKER_06]: But Doom 4 is on its way.

499
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:59,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And CEO Todd Hollinsheet said this week in a press release, quote, Doom is part of the ID software DNA and demands the greatest talent and brightest minds in the industry to bring the next installment of our flagship franchise to Earth.

500
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:02,234
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no other details given at this time.

501
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:06,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Speculation is that ID's Tech 5 engine will be used.

502
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:07,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knows?

503
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:10,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And story-wise, who knows where this game could go?

504
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:14,563
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, if the movie didn't kill the franchise, then it could go anywhere.

505
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Doom 4.

506
00:34:16,124 --> 00:34:17,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you excited about Doom 4?

507
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:17,325
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

508
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:21,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom 3 looked really awesome, but I don't know.

509
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:23,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't have the charm of Doom 1 and Doom 2 for me.

510
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really liked Doom.

511
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing Doom for the charm?

512
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:27,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, for the charm.

513
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Doom 1 and 2 for the mods, but that's about it.

514
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:32,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really care for the games.

515
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even really get into Quake either.

516
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:36,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Duke Nukem 3D, that was my game.

517
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:37,915
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I liked about Doom?

518
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, you know, I don't know.

519
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:42,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Wolfenstein, that was a good game.

520
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:44,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Doom didn't do it for me.

521
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:50,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I think mainly Doom didn't do it for me because at the time my PC couldn't run it.

522
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:54,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Only had one meg of RAM, so it was a little tough to run that game.

523
00:34:55,178 --> 00:35:00,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Your friend and mine, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, ID makes great engines, they don't make great games.

524
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:07,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the first Doom because, first of all, it had a difficulty level called Hurt Me Plenty.

525
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, the Wolfenstein levels.

526
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:11,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

527
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,767
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about ID and IDDQD and IDBFG.

528
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget Hexen and how freaking awesome that game is.

529
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Hexen was great because of the NRA code.

530
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:21,431
[SPEAKER_04]: All weapons.

531
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:22,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

532
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:23,693
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

533
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And God mode was Satan.

534
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:27,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

535
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:28,276
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

536
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:29,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to go to the Skype line.

537
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:35,842
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, if you heard a little background noise, it's because we already picked it up where we have two people sitting on the Skype line right now, if I'm not mistaking.

538
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:37,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin, you are there, correct?

539
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:37,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

540
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:38,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am.

541
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:47,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing very well, actually.

542
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

543
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:54,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, now we've got a little bit of a score to settle, and I don't even know how this came about, but it turned out that we have this Rev... Rev?

544
00:35:54,932 --> 00:36:02,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Rescode we've been trying to give away for, like, I don't know, like two months, and somehow we found out that you two didn't have it.

545
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:07,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And which is so funny, because tonight, like, everybody's been PMing me, like, I wanna play, I wanna play, because I want the code.

546
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:16,081
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, no, we said a couple weeks ago it was gonna be Toshin versus Footy, but we originally said we were gonna play the match game, but I hate to break it to you guys, we thought of something new.

547
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to subject you to a new game tonight because we can do that.

548
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:19,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our show.

549
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:21,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I am very scared about this.

550
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:22,306
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be.

551
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you scared, Toshin?

552
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:24,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

553
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:25,148
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

554
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:31,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's unveil the game that Toshin and Footy will be playing tonight for the Rez HD Code.

555
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:37,318
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

556
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:44,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the OLR Family Feud will be what Toshin and Footy are playing tonight.

557
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:47,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here's the deal.

558
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:55,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We have surveyed several OLR personalities in different video gaming categories.

559
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:56,887
[SPEAKER_06]: The OLR family, if you will.

560
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And you two will be competing against each other head to head to see who can earn more points.

561
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's how you earn more points.

562
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:07,576
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to pick a number 1 through 4 that will be the board that you play when it's your turn.

563
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:12,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, on the board are the top answers in a particular video gaming category.

564
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, let's say, best game ever.

565
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can take turns at the board to see what the hosts and our friends would have said was the best game ever.

566
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if you don't guess correctly, you guess something that's not on the board, you get a strike.

567
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:32,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Three strikes, and it will go to the other player who will get one chance to steal the board and all of your points.

568
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So you definitely, uh, don't want to have your board stolen.

569
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:36,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

570
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you familiar with the show, Toshin?

571
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:39,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am.

572
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:41,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you familiar with the show, Footy?

573
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what you just said.

574
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then you're in trouble, my friend.

575
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:47,783
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

576
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:48,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

577
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,646
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have Toshin go first then.

578
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:55,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, Footy, hopefully you can figure out what's going on quickly.

579
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,431
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

580
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, basically, it comes down to what?

581
00:37:57,981 --> 00:38:03,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say a name of a person that would have said what is the best game to them?

582
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:04,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a person, not a person.

583
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:07,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say the category was best video game ever made.

584
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:12,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, since you know that I answered it, you would probably guess that Super Metroid is somewhere on the board.

585
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'd hear, ding.

586
00:38:14,412 --> 00:38:17,214
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you guessed, you know, a game that none of us... It's kind of like a bingo thing.

587
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:21,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you guessed Crysis, then you'd hear, eh, because none of us would have picked that.

588
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,438
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so, because we're not Sakura Max.

589
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:23,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay.

590
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:24,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

591
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:27,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to be telling us whose names are on the board?

592
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

593
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have to guess the name?

594
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:29,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm going to.

595
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:30,943
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't have to guess the name.

596
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:32,764
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to guess the answers that are on the board.

597
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:34,105
[SPEAKER_06]: This is getting complicated.

598
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:34,385
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

599
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,025
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

600
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:35,626
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

601
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is the OLR family that have contributed to tonight's answers.

00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Miklatov contributed to the board tonight.

605
00:38:48,814 --> 00:38:53,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Rice Princess and DMN all have contributed answers to the board.

606
00:38:54,698 --> 00:39:20,940
[SPEAKER_06]: possible answers but sometimes answers are worth more because multiple people said them like for instance if it had been best game ever Chrono Trigger probably would have been worth like three points so does that make sense yeah alright here we go oh we have to do it just like they do on the show let's play the feud I said let's play the feud where's the damn music there we go let's play the feud alright

607
00:39:21,758 --> 00:39:22,479

00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin, since you know what you're doing, we're going to have you go first.

610
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:30,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So Toshin, do you want board number one, board number two, board number three, or board number four?

611
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,134
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 Doom Doom

612
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my sound effect?

613
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Feud's broken.

614
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:07,283
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

615
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:09,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I said is Doom on the board?

[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, ding ding ding, yes, Doom is on the board.

00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:13,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so you get one point.

618
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:14,508
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth one point.

619
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Toshin, you have one point so far.

620
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:17,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

621
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom is definitely on the sound board.

622
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:20,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

623
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:23,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom is all over my sound board tonight.

624
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:26,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, guess again, Toshin.

625
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:26,735
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no strikes.

626
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:28,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Best first impression shooting game ever.

627
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Quake.

628
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:31,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Quake.

629
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:34,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we all have to applaud and say, good answer, good answer.

630
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:34,992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

631
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:37,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Quake on the board?

632
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:38,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

633
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:40,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Quake is not on the board.

634
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one strike against you.

635
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:42,474
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

636
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:43,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Make another guess.

637
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:45,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolfenstein.

638
00:40:46,536 --> 00:40:47,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolfenstein.

639
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Wolfenstein on the board?

640
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two strikes against you, Toshin.

641
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:54,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

642
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:55,279
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

643
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Footy, be prepared to steal if it comes over to you.

644
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,480
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

645
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:02,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin, what's another first person shooting game?

646
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:03,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo.

647
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:04,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo!

648
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:06,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me Halo!

649
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:12,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's three strikes, Toshin.

650
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Footy, it's your chance to steal.

651
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:21,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get one point and whatever other points you get for the answer if you can guess what's on the board for best first person shooting game ever.

652
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:29,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, um, he said, sorry, Wolfenstein, Quake, and, uh, which other, do you say, Toshin?

653
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:30,514
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say anything.

654
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you should have been paying attention.

655
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:34,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, fine, that's how you are, okay?

656
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

657
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:36,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are getting dirty.

658
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Duke Nukem 3D.

659
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke Nukem 3D, show me Duke Nukem 3D!

660
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

661
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:50,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's the number one answer.

662
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:55,407
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, three people, Rob, Loki, and Irene all said Duke Nukem 3.

663
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:56,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew Loki would have said that.

664
00:41:57,088 --> 00:42:02,231
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Footy, you just stole Toshin's point and three of your own.

665
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you've got four points from that board.

666
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:05,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin has zero.

667
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin, stop embarrassing Canada.

668
00:42:08,094 --> 00:42:08,915
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, no, I'm just kidding.

669
00:42:09,615 --> 00:42:10,196
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing a good job.

670
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:12,037
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's look at what else was on the board.

671
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:13,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie said Doom, for the record, by the way.

672
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,859
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, the remaining answers were...

673
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:19,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal, said Bobby Blackwolf.

674
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:22,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Unreal Tournament 2003, said Miklatov.

675
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:25,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Dark, said DMN.

676
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:26,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, those are the other answers that you didn't guess.

677
00:42:26,826 --> 00:42:28,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, no Golden I Love there?

678
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:30,248
[SPEAKER_06]: No Golden I Love, I'm surprised too.

679
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:32,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Footy, it's your turn.

680
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Which board do you want to go for?

681
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:35,732
[SPEAKER_10]: That was what, 4-3, right?

682
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:37,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's board three.

683
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:38,513
[SPEAKER_06]: You want board one, two, or four?

684
00:42:38,713 --> 00:42:40,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, now the ding noise loads.

685
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:42,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Like an hour later.

686
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:45,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Then give me board two.

687
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:46,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking internet.

688
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:46,775
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

689
00:42:47,395 --> 00:42:48,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Board two.

690
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:51,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Best music in a game.

691
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:52,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one game name.

692
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,777
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not looking for a song.

693
00:42:53,817 --> 00:42:56,277
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for like a game as a whole with the best soundtrack.

694
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:58,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So best music in a game.

695
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,098
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your guess, Footy?

696
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Castlevania Symphony of the Night?

697
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:04,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

698
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:05,629
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good guess.

699
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:06,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Good answer.

700
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Good answer.

701
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:07,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me Symphony of the Night.

702
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a strike, Footy.

703
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:11,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

704
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:13,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of surprised, too, that didn't come up.

705
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:14,271
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

706
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:15,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's lots of games out there.

707
00:43:16,072 --> 00:43:16,332
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

708
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:19,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Best music in a game from the OLR family.

709
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:19,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Footy.

710
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:21,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Question.

711
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:25,474
[SPEAKER_10]: If I were to say DDR, do I have to say the specific version?

712
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:27,254
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

713
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:29,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

714
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:29,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Dance Revolution.

715
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:31,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal, ShowMePortal

716
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:04,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, three strikes and no points, footy.

717
00:44:05,127 --> 00:44:12,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Toshin, you can still steal the board and earn a point if you can correctly guess what anybody in the OLR family named best music in a game.

718
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin.

719
00:44:13,054 --> 00:44:14,175
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft.

720
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,336
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft.

721
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:17,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me Warcraft.

722
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

723
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys sucked on that one.

724
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:23,763
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

725
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:25,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty tough.

726
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:25,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

727
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:26,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Here are the answers on the board.

728
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:27,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Top seven answers.

729
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob said Final Fantasy VI.

730
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:45,724
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura said Mega Man 2 Loki said Katamari Damacy Bobby said Super Smash Brothers Brawl Shane said Silent Hill Irene said Chrono Trigger and DMN said Rock Band

731
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:49,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of those games were on the board.

732
00:44:49,451 --> 00:44:50,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing is selected here.

733
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:51,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I had good guesses.

734
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:51,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

735
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:53,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I had guesses and I'm very happy with myself.

736
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:54,834
[SPEAKER_06]: You did have good guesses.

737
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:55,295
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

738
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,156
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a comment in the chat.

739
00:44:57,176 --> 00:45:00,979
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, Toshin and FootyMonster equals bad Family Feud players.

740
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:01,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Now give me my shout out.

741
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.

742
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:04,501
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

743
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:05,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just teasing.

[SPEAKER_06]: You get two dings for that.

00:45:59,105 --> 00:45:59,905
[SPEAKER_06]: All said Samus Aran.

[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Toshin.

780
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:18,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Three points on the board.

781
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:26,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Best female would have to be... I'm going to go with a wing.

782
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:27,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say Eris.

783
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Eris from Final Fantasy 7.

784
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:30,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

00:46:30,722 --> 00:46:31,882
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good answer.

786
00:46:31,942 --> 00:46:32,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Good answer.

787
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:32,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me.

788
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:35,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, DarkSakura says that's a bad answer.

789
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:36,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

790
00:46:36,565 --> 00:46:37,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

791
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I have my game saved so I can watch her die over and over again.

792
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:41,488
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

793
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,069
[SPEAKER_06]: There's seven people that put in answers.

794
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:44,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody might have liked Eris.

795
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

796
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Did anybody like Eris?

797
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:48,293
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

798
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:49,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody likes Eris.

799
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have taste.

800
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:51,074
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

801
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:51,775
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

802
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Two strikes, Toshin.

803
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:54,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not over yet.

804
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin.

805
00:46:56,673 --> 00:46:59,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess best female video game character ever.

806
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:01,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Lara Croft.

807
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:05,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider series.

808
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:05,895
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

809
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there Lara Croft?

810
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:12,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's three strikes.

811
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,516
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's all right, Toshin.

812
00:47:13,536 --> 00:47:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be too frustrated.

813
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:17,077
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Footy, your chance to steal the board and the three points.

814
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:21,418
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can guess one of the remaining four answers on the board, best female video game character ever.

815
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:24,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

816
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:25,179
[SPEAKER_10]: This is hard.

817
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:25,759
[SPEAKER_10]: There's too many.

818
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:35,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say all of them, but... Chun-Li, why not?

819
00:47:35,901 --> 00:47:39,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Chun-Li, if you get this right, you will have seven points.

820
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:45,610
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get it wrong, Toshi finally gets on the board with three points.

821
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:47,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Chun-Li up there?

822
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:51,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Is my soundboard going to work?

823
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:52,644
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

824
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:54,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Chun-Li up there?

825
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,745
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Chun-Li's not on the damn board.

826
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:01,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so DingDingDingTotion gets the three points.

827
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:02,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's now three to four.

828
00:48:04,406 --> 00:48:06,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Three points Canada, four points Argentina.

829
00:48:06,227 --> 00:48:06,527
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

830
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:11,988
[SPEAKER_07]: As the sound man behind the scenes here, if you're picking a different sample, you can double click on it.

831
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:13,769
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's the same sample, you have to hit play.

832
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:14,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thank you.

833
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:15,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I know.

834
00:48:18,788 --> 00:48:21,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin, I want you to say Toshi!

835
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:24,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Get back to the game, please.

836
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:25,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go.

837
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:42,073
[SPEAKER_06]: The correct answer is Rob said Princess Peach, Loki said Mai because of her assets, Bobby Blackwolf said GLaDOS, and DMN said Morrigan from the Darkstalkers.

838
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:43,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it was in the 2D fighter area.

839
00:48:44,613 --> 00:48:44,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

840
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:46,314

[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Toshin, here it is.

904
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:33,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your chance to steal.

905
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you what the stakes are here.

906
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,653
[SPEAKER_06]: If you steal the board, you will win.

907
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,476
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you don't steal the board, footy will win.

908
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:42,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it comes down to right here.

909
00:51:42,638 --> 00:51:43,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Toshin.

910
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,661
[SPEAKER_06]: You've thought and you've thought.

911
00:51:45,761 --> 00:51:48,702
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you say is the best Atari 2600 game ever?

912
00:51:49,003 --> 00:51:51,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I already know the answer I should have given.

913
00:51:52,044 --> 00:51:53,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your name Toshin?

914
00:51:53,685 --> 00:51:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remember of a game.

915
00:51:57,207 --> 00:51:58,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshin, what's it going to be?

916
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:00,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Asteroids

917
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,164
[SPEAKER_06]: for the game.

918
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:34,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me asteroids!

919
00:52:38,387 --> 00:52:39,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

920
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:43,048
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the other one you were thinking of?

921
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:44,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazy climber.

922
00:52:45,134 --> 00:52:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Climber was on the Atari 2600, I think.

923
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:48,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought of Joust for some reason.

924
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:49,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me run down the top answers.

925
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:50,780
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to hate me for this one.

926
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob said Pitfall 2.

927
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:05,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, come on.

928
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:06,215
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unfair.

929
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:07,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Pitfall.

930
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:07,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Play the games.

931
00:53:08,036 --> 00:53:08,797
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a big difference.

932
00:53:09,277 --> 00:53:10,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie said Kangaroo.

933
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:12,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki said Combat.

934
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane said Spider-Man.

935
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:17,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Irene said Missile Command.

936
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:22,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And DMN said Warlords were the answers that were left on the board.

937
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:23,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

938
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:26,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Argentina and Footy Monster wins 5-3.

939
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:35,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft has the code, so Actdeft, I'm going to have you send that code over to Footy, because he'll get his right away for actually winning.

940
00:53:35,773 --> 00:53:37,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And Toshin, you'll get yours later.

941
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:41,635
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually probably going to give you just Microsoft points so you can buy it, okay?

942
00:53:55,522 --> 00:53:55,782
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

943
00:53:56,682 --> 00:53:57,322
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong?

944
00:53:57,562 --> 00:53:58,983
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still getting something, man.

945
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I want as much as anybody else right now.

946
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:03,145
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it anyway, you just gotta wait a little while.

947
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:04,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Four to six weeks for shipping and handling.

948
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:05,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

949
00:54:06,426 --> 00:54:07,246
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fun, actually.

950
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:08,587
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a fun game.

951
00:54:08,627 --> 00:54:09,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you like the game?

952
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know what I was getting into.

953
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:10,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did.

954
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:11,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually liked it.

955
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:11,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to see.

956
00:54:12,189 --> 00:54:12,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat room.

957
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:13,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys like the game?

958
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we do it again in the future?

959
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:15,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see you in the chat.

960
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:16,512
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

961
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:24,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you guys very much for playing and subjecting yourself to the OLR Family Feud featuring the crappy soundboard.

962
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:26,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

963
00:54:28,962 --> 00:54:29,382
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

964
00:54:31,997 --> 00:54:34,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright guys, we're going to hang up on you and have a good night, okay?

965
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:36,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thank you guys.

966
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye-bye.

967
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And Footy, let me know if Actdeft doesn't get you the code because I have it somewhere, but I'm sure he'll send it to you, okay?

968
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:45,686
[SPEAKER_10]: He just sent me a message asking for my email, so I'm guessing we're in the works.

969
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:46,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

970
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:47,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one.

971
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:48,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And Toshin, I'll be in touch with you.

972
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:49,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye-bye.

973
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:52,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

974
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:53,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys like the game?

975
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:55,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It went on for like 20 minutes.

976
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:56,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool.

977
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:57,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of fun.

978
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,034
[SPEAKER_06]: A little different.

979
00:54:58,814 --> 00:54:59,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

980
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:00,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

981
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:01,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

982
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:11,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the concept but it's a horrible game you can't get anyone's answers the group being surveyed is way too difficult to predict it's funny to hear their answers but you're impossible to guess them

983
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's any better than the match game?

984
00:55:16,307 --> 00:55:16,647
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

985
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:18,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

986
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:22,293
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try a version where we survey the entire chat room before the show.

987
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:22,794
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

988
00:55:22,874 --> 00:55:24,716
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the chatters know what's coming.

989
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:25,417
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.

990
00:55:25,497 --> 00:55:26,918
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we didn't do it that way this time.

991
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:28,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Because then they know what questions are coming.

992
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,601
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just see you.

993
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:31,383
[SPEAKER_07]: This is fine the way it was.

994
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:32,084
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

995
00:55:32,384 --> 00:55:34,046
[SPEAKER_07]: They can quit their bitching.

996
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:34,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

997
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:39,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see what happens with that in the future.

998
00:55:39,189 --> 00:55:41,370
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, we've got to go back to some more news.

999
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:46,713
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got more gaming news, just a little bit, and then we're going to open the Skype line for you guys to give us a call with your own thoughts.

1000
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:47,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And set it on fire.

1001
00:55:47,954 --> 00:55:49,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and then we'll set the Skype line on fire.

1002
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuego!

1003
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and any excuse for me to play the Pac-Man noise again will be welcomed.

1004
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, next story, please.

1005
00:55:56,779 --> 00:55:57,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Gaiden 2.

1006
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,721
[SPEAKER_04]: If you pre-order it, you get stuff.

1007
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

1008
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:03,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

1009
00:56:18,078 --> 00:56:20,158
[SPEAKER_04]: lets you look like the bad guys that you're facing.

1010
00:56:20,198 --> 00:56:24,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically a nice big costume for Ryu.

1011
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:38,842
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you are of the more patient variety, you can download a costume pack of three in July, which will be 200 Microsoft points.

1012
00:56:38,882 --> 00:56:45,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Gaiden 2 will be out in Europe on the 6th of June, so you can test out how fun it is then.

1013
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,760
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1014
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:50,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1015
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, indeed.

1016
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:52,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff.

1017
00:56:53,184 --> 00:56:53,524
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1018
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:54,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I like stuff.

1019
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:59,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't like having to pre-order games because then a better deal will come out the day the game comes out.

1020
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1021
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:05,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's going to be hopefully some interesting news coming very soon.

1022
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:17,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Microsoft is having a PR event next week where they're going to supposedly debut the new Xbox 360 motion controller.

1023
00:57:18,044 --> 00:57:21,405
[SPEAKER_07]: and, of course, we talked about it last week, their partnership with Gyration.

1024
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:28,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the other things that they're going to be unveiling, and I know this is probably going to happen, is Banjo-Kazooie 3.

1025
00:57:28,467 --> 00:57:31,527
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, there's been some screenshots that have already come out for that.

1026
00:57:32,107 --> 00:57:37,109
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's going to be interesting to see what goes on.

1027
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:40,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is during the Game Critics Awards, I guess.

1028
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:46,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That's supposed to happen next week, so... I don't know.

1029
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:47,211
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1030
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:48,942
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1031
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:51,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, a good idea came to us.

1032
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read this aloud for the Family Feud?

1033
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:55,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

1034
00:57:55,565 --> 00:57:55,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1035
00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a good idea.

1036
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:02,129
[SPEAKER_06]: We could survey the chatroom for Family Feud and have people in studio play.

1037
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:04,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when we have some of our guests here.

1038
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:07,031
[SPEAKER_06]: We could get Rice Princess and Mo to battle each other.

1039
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:10,233
[SPEAKER_06]: We could get Nathan and Nextifer or something.

1040
00:58:10,413 --> 00:58:12,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Get some guests on the show to battle each other.

1041
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,375
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be kind of fun.

1042
00:58:14,537 --> 00:58:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be a way to do it.

1043
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:18,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're dealing with some good access to the chatroom.

1044
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:18,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1045
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:19,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it would be a secret.

1046
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that idea.

1047
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make them face like us.

1048
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1049
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:23,742
[SPEAKER_04]: A panel of us.

1050
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:25,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's chatroom feud at that point.

1051
00:58:25,322 --> 00:58:26,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's what we'll rename it to.

1052
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,283
[SPEAKER_06]: The chatroom feud.

1053
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:28,204
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1054
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, sorry.

1055
00:58:29,064 --> 00:58:31,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to derail from the topic of the games.

1056
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:32,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you did.

1057
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:33,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did a little bit.

1058
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:34,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean...

1059
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:37,947
[SPEAKER_06]: How much of a wee ripoff is this going to be, if at all?

1060
00:58:37,987 --> 00:58:40,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think they are going a totally different direction with this?

1061
00:58:40,928 --> 00:58:41,948
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends what they do with it.

1062
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:53,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if it's going to be like the other Q-Motion stuff, which is essentially you buy something that looks like a bowling ball, something that looks like a golf club and something like that.

1063
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:55,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how popular that's going to be.

1064
00:58:55,779 --> 00:59:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be nifty, but it's not going to be something that I think you'd have to go run out right away and buy.

1065
00:59:01,981 --> 00:59:08,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I would like to see them come up with something a little bit more universal so you're not buying this huge peripheral for one game.

1066
00:59:09,343 --> 00:59:11,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'd be kind of retarded.

1067
00:59:12,024 --> 00:59:13,064
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I don't know.

1068
00:59:13,084 --> 00:59:14,544
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to see what they come up with.

1069
00:59:14,744 --> 00:59:22,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be hard for them not to be kind of accused of ripping off Nintendo.

1070
00:59:22,447 --> 00:59:22,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1071
00:59:23,868 --> 00:59:28,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even Sony was accused of ripping off Nintendo when that 6-axis was thrown in at the last minute, remember that?

1072
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And that wasn't even really the same thing, you know what I mean?

1073
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:36,712
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, though, it's just like, oh, now it has motion-sensitive stuff.

1074
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:40,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, what did that pan out to?

1075
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:44,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hardly any games use it, so... I don't know.

1076
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:45,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1077
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:55,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, we got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to be getting to the Skype line here very shortly, but this next story requires some music.

1078
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:00,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what that means.

1079
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:04,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody earned themselves a stupid award this week in some horrific...

1080
01:00:05,485 --> 01:00:10,690
[SPEAKER_06]: The person who wins the Stupid Award on OLR this week is Edward Stoddard!

1081
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations!

1082
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:15,434
[SPEAKER_06]: He was arrested in Dade City, and you know what he did?

1083
01:00:16,175 --> 01:00:19,678
[SPEAKER_06]: He murdered his neighbor over a missing PlayStation 3.

1084
01:00:19,758 --> 01:00:27,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, he murdered Douglas Abrams because they were arguing over the PlayStation 3 on April 24th.

1085
01:00:29,853 --> 01:00:38,039
[SPEAKER_06]: No really word on what it was that they were specifically arguing about, but it just kind of begs the question, is a PlayStation 3 really worth killing someone over?

1086
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,441
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

1087
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:42,963
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have been playing Grand Theft Auto 4 on said PlayStation 3.

1088
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:50,082
[SPEAKER_06]: But it just goes to show, you know, regardless, you know, obviously this guy obviously has issues.

1089
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:52,103
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs to play Wii Ethics.

1090
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:56,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it appropriate to kill someone over a missing video game console?

1091
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:56,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes or no?

1092
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:59,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you say yes, then the console spits acid at you or something.

1093
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:00,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1094
01:01:00,569 --> 01:01:02,250
[SPEAKER_06]: But, wait, that's not good.

1095
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1096
01:01:04,632 --> 01:01:05,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong!

1097
01:01:05,573 --> 01:01:06,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong answer.

1098
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:06,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Die.

1099
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:08,695
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be erased from humanity.

1100
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:09,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of the gene pool.

1101
01:01:09,455 --> 01:01:09,556
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1102
01:01:09,576 --> 01:01:09,656
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1103
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:20,740
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of it being highly corrosive acid, it should be minorly corrosive acid so that they're left with chemical burns and you all know that they scored wrong.

1104
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:21,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

1105
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:23,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be great.

1106
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:24,621
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got issues.

1107
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:26,442
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, because it wouldn't kill them.

1108
01:01:26,962 --> 01:01:30,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd just maim them a little and everyone would know that they're stupid.

1109
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:31,284
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1110
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:35,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, stupid award stories usually make me a little bit angsty.

1111
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the fact that I forgot to put it anywhere else.

1112
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:38,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was about to mention that.

1113
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:40,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, come on.

1114
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:41,530
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1115
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:41,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I caught it.

1116
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:42,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I caught it.

1117
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Whew, saved myself.

1118
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:44,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, CFU's of the week.

1119
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:05,858
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week, now I told Rob what it was on Friday, but I've decided to expand it a little bit.

1120
01:02:06,718 --> 01:02:16,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And my FU of the week is to people who buy into what they're told without researching it first.

1121
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:22,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And my primary example was the practice of circumcising little boys.

1122
01:02:22,853 --> 01:02:24,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Ow, crossing legs.

1123
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:36,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I understand that for religious purposes it's part of your culture, but for purpose of aesthetics or thinking that it's healthy, no, it's not.

1124
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:43,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually it ends up being very traumatic and also makes getting the nookie a lot less satisfying.

1125
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been proven wrong.

1126
01:02:46,224 --> 01:03:03,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So also, in the same tone then, it goes to people who think that just because Specialist A has said, oh, this is not what you want to do, that suddenly it's law.

1127
01:03:03,858 --> 01:03:07,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not going to go into specifics on that in particular, but there's...

1128
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:12,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, actually, I'm going to sort of go into specifics on this one.

1129
01:03:12,763 --> 01:03:13,403
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

1130
01:03:13,943 --> 01:03:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: There being some sort of widespread rumor that if you were a massage therapist, then you were suddenly in adult entertainment, and this is why I get really pissed off at the whole happy ending bullshit, because of people who think that, and those jokes that go around.

1131
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:34,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been able to get my business license for six months.

1132
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:36,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Don't.

1133
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:48,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very, very, very angry about that, but they've revamped the requirements for it in my town and made it to where I can get my license again.

1134
01:03:49,776 --> 01:03:52,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It also goes towards people who, you know...

1135
01:03:53,821 --> 01:04:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really just a bunch of what we think, a bunch of what we accept as fact in our daily lives is really, in most cases, the result of sensationalism and people trying to tell us what they want us to think so that we'll spend money in said area, so that more money will go into the pockets of people who

1136
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:19,894
[SPEAKER_04]: FDU Driving to and from Oakland It's long and boring

1137
01:04:38,072 --> 01:04:38,632
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's Oakland.

1138
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:40,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that it?

1139
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a long drive and you're like, oh, yay, Oakland.

1140
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,456
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a yummy Indian food place in Oakland I ate at once.

1141
01:04:49,516 --> 01:04:56,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of food, F you to the news I got this week that due to my pancreatitis I had back in April when I was in the hospital for a few days.

1142
01:04:57,919 --> 01:05:03,040
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the fact that I will be stuck on a low-fat diet for two more months, which means no Indian food.

1143
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:07,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess there's some Indian food dishes I can have, but no garlic naan or the stuff I really like

1144
01:05:07,802 --> 01:05:09,543
[SPEAKER_06]: for two more months at least.

1145
01:05:09,603 --> 01:05:13,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that that means I can't have cake or ice cream on my 30th birthday, that kind of blows.

1146
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:16,625
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least I'd rather be eating low fat than be dead.

1147
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So F you to that.

1148
01:05:17,946 --> 01:05:22,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And F you to the fact that on top of dealing with all that, I think I'm getting a cold or something.

1149
01:05:22,707 --> 01:05:24,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So F you to being sick twice at the same time.

1150
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:25,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of sucks.

1151
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:28,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want this year to go away.

1152
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,450
[SPEAKER_06]: The show's been good, though.

1153
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:31,691
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one good thing about it.

1154
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:32,391
[SPEAKER_06]: The show's been great.

1155
01:05:33,479 --> 01:05:33,759
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1156
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Hippolytus in chat asks, dude, how much weight has Sky lost?

1157
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:38,401
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 pounds.

1158
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:39,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lost 25 pounds.

1159
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:41,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have quite a bit of a little bit of a beer gut.

1160
01:05:41,622 --> 01:05:42,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have a tiny little beer gut.

1161
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:47,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be starting to work out soon because I'm starting to feel a lot better, like my chest and everything.

1162
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:52,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be – I'm going to have abs by the time all is said and done.

1163
01:05:52,646 --> 01:05:53,087
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1164
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:54,687
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's the goal.

1165
01:05:56,148 --> 01:05:56,528
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1166
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to the Skype line.

1167
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,351
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be taking some calls on the Skype line.

1168
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:12,716
[SPEAKER_06]: You can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1169
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have time for a lot of calls tonight, but we'll definitely try to get some calls in.

1170
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:18,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can call us right now.

1171
01:06:18,899 --> 01:06:21,401
[SPEAKER_06]: While we wait for some calls, do you have a quick last minute story for us, Matt?

1172
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:24,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Prototype's been delayed to 2009.

1173
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:25,431
[SPEAKER_07]: What's Prototype?

1174
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:29,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It was this game that was like Crackdown, but you're like a mutant and can do crazy shit.

1175
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:30,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Jump around.

1176
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Big sandbox game.

1177
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1178
01:06:32,181 --> 01:06:33,143
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to come out this fall.

1179
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:33,584
[SPEAKER_07]: 2009 now.

1180
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:36,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's too bad.

1181
01:06:36,407 --> 01:06:36,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1182
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:37,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

1183
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:43,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Killzone 2 was officially announced for February 2009, so that's pretty awesome.

1184
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:47,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Resistance is still coming out this fall, so I think we have that to look forward to.

1185
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,010
[SPEAKER_07]: But Killzone 2, pretty cool.

1186
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,711
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some footage online for that, but apparently it got yanked because it wasn't supposed to be out yet.

1187
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:55,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

1188
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:56,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks.

1189
01:06:57,412 --> 01:06:58,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to ZPhones.

1190
01:06:59,513 --> 01:07:00,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1191
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:01,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1192
01:07:04,275 --> 01:07:06,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's Clicky the pen.

1193
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:09,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Clicky, who gave you access to a telephone?

1194
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:13,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Clicky, what are you doing?

1195
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Sky.

1196
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:16,629
[SPEAKER_05]: He must have butt-dialed you guys or something.

1197
01:07:16,669 --> 01:07:17,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1198
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:18,732
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Bobby.

1199
01:07:18,832 --> 01:07:20,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Clicky trying to flirt with the ferret?

1200
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it was.

1201
01:07:22,176 --> 01:07:23,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's demanding ransom.

1202
01:07:23,717 --> 01:07:24,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he knows where the ferret is.

1203
01:07:26,378 --> 01:07:27,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Clicky Kidnapped the Ferret

1204
01:07:41,946 --> 01:08:00,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you talked, it's always funny because you do the show that's on right before us on allgames.com at 5 o'clock Pacific, and you were talking about the whole DRM, Digital Rights Management thing, which I read about earlier this week, and I was like, I want to talk about it this week on Orange Lounge Radio, and then it didn't even make it in our show roll because I forgot.

1205
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't supposed to be worth talking about.

1206
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:03,611
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1207
01:08:04,252 --> 01:08:08,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, sum up what happened real quick because I want to get Bobby's opinion on this and our other opinions.

1208
01:08:09,254 --> 01:08:20,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, EA came up with this wonderful idea that both Mass Effect and Spore were going to be validated via, I guess, an online call-home thing every 10 days.

1209
01:08:20,861 --> 01:08:23,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it didn't do that, it wouldn't work anymore.

1210
01:08:24,022 --> 01:08:24,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1211
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:26,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucked.

1212
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:31,306
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they came out and decided, hey, we're not going to do that because people don't like that kind of thing.

1213
01:08:31,766 --> 01:08:37,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So now Mass Effect is going to authenticate itself when you first install it.

1214
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:41,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you download any additional download content, it will redo that as well.

1215
01:08:41,711 --> 01:08:42,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with Spore.

1216
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:46,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Spore, once you install it, and also if you connect to online.

1217
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:51,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Bobby, what are your thoughts on this?

1218
01:08:51,448 --> 01:08:56,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to spoil your whole show because I know you go into it on your show, but quickly, what were kind of your thoughts on this issue?

1219
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my thing was more because they're trying to market Spore because Will Wright was on the Colbert Report.

1220
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:04,782
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been doing the late-night talk show rounds.

1221
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:15,424
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to market Spore to a larger audience than just gamers, and not every person who has a computer actually has Internet access from their home.

1222
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:19,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Either they use it for work or they go to a public library or something.

1223
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:23,146
[SPEAKER_05]: They may have a decent computer, but it may not necessarily be online.

1224
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:33,735
[SPEAKER_05]: and so even that one-time activation may be a problem for some people because they're used to just getting this DVD or CD and sticking it in their computer and playing and now you can't do that.

1225
01:09:33,815 --> 01:09:35,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you have to have this other charge.

1226
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:38,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have internet service from your home just to play it.

1227
01:09:39,099 --> 01:10:04,452
[SPEAKER_05]: and the reason that they got rid of the 10 day phoning home every 10 days was actually because of the US Armed Forces they can't guarantee an internet connection when they're overseas but they still play games on their PC they do have down time to get their mind off of what they're doing and I think that's why they got rid of the 10 day restriction but there's still that first time and then any other time when you're online then it will check but it's not going to force you but I think it still leaves out a segment of the population that doesn't have internet at home

1228
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:15,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would think, especially in the case of the armed forces who are doing a big job that not a lot of people want to do for this country, I would hope that EA would come up with a way that they can bypass it.

1229
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,574
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the armed forces can get a special version of the game or something.

1230
01:10:18,935 --> 01:10:23,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted... If there was a special version of the game that the armed forces got, it would be on the internet.

1231
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:26,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess that's the unfortunate side of that is it would happen.

1232
01:10:26,879 --> 01:10:30,042
[SPEAKER_06]: But somehow, like I don't know, there's got to be something that they could do.

1233
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:32,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Even with this, I think it's going to be broken.

1234
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:32,804
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

1235
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody finds a way to get past everything.

1236
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:36,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1237
01:10:36,508 --> 01:10:38,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't Bioshock do something similar?

1238
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:40,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but people found ways around that.

1239
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:45,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, people – like it would only let you install it on so many computers and it had to connect to the internet each time.

1240
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:47,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once it hit its limit, too bad, so sad.

1241
01:10:48,598 --> 01:10:49,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, yeah.

1242
01:10:49,339 --> 01:10:50,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something like that.

1243
01:10:51,204 --> 01:11:14,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee points out in chatroom the portal retail version requires online to start up which is well I don't know because I bought it on Steam and Steam does all that copy protection stuff you know kind of as part of I think you have to have Steam when you buy the retail version oh that's right that's right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago not that I know or anything but they found a way around that you heard I heard yeah okay

1244
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that from your independent research that you did?

1245
01:11:19,061 --> 01:11:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I own the Orange Box on Xbox 360.

1246
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to see what it looked like on my PC.

1247
01:11:27,185 --> 01:11:27,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1248
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:30,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?

1249
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:33,708
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was it.

1250
01:11:33,728 --> 01:11:34,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1251
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:35,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Clicky, don't come back.

1252
01:11:35,889 --> 01:11:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't talk about the ferret.

1253
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Clicky.

1254
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:40,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not nice, Clicky.

1255
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:43,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know they've got an explicit tag, Clicky, but go away.

1256
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that, Rob.

1257
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,141
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's quite okay.

1258
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:51,042
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm thinking maybe Clicky and the Ferret could get their own show that no one would listen to.

1259
01:11:51,762 --> 01:11:52,302
[SPEAKER_06]: No one.

1260
01:11:53,462 --> 01:11:54,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Except maybe Jamie.

1261
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:58,123
[SPEAKER_06]: She's making pouty face at me.

1262
01:11:58,703 --> 01:11:59,483
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, bye, Bobby.

1263
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:00,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, Clicky.

1264
01:12:01,124 --> 01:12:01,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, Rob.

1265
01:12:02,244 --> 01:12:02,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Go away, Clicky.

1266
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:05,885
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1267
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:09,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackboy in chat says, I would totally listen to that show.

1268
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:10,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

1269
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,326
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly would Clicky and the Ferret talk about?

1270
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:15,527
[SPEAKER_06]: What do pens and ferrets have in common?

1271
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:16,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

1272
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:18,308
[SPEAKER_04]: They're long.

1273
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:19,308
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1274
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:20,869
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to the phones.

1275
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:21,569
[SPEAKER_06]: We got more calls.

1276
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:22,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1277
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1278
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he did a way better job than me.

1279
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

1280
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:28,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that he can win.

1281
01:12:51,607 --> 01:12:54,209
[SPEAKER_06]: We still appreciate the effort and are feeling the love very much.

1282
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:55,750
[SPEAKER_06]: To what do we owe this call tonight, Actdeft?

1283
01:12:58,372 --> 01:13:02,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, basically, I was going to congratulate Matt for winning.

1284
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:15,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I hope that he gets all our, how do you say it, support for him to win the oldgames.com contest overall.

1285
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:25,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Though I hope he gives the console to Loki because I was going to do that if I won.

1286
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Actdeft was serious.

1287
01:13:27,867 --> 01:13:30,068
[SPEAKER_06]: He was going to give you the console if you won.

1288
01:13:30,108 --> 01:13:33,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would not have let him do that because that's a foolish thing to do.

1289
01:13:33,589 --> 01:13:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have made him keep it.

1290
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a foolish thing to do.

1291
01:13:35,771 --> 01:13:44,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been watching your mailbox and when I see this big box coming from Mexico, I would have written died and sent it back.

1292
01:13:44,615 --> 01:13:45,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Expired.

1293
01:13:47,096 --> 01:13:48,157
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't work, by the way.

1294
01:13:49,437 --> 01:13:50,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you tried doing that to Junkmail?

1295
01:13:50,678 --> 01:13:51,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried that with Junkmail.

1296
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:53,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Deceased.

1297
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:54,600
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they don't believe it.

1298
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:59,442
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, oh, hey, well, someone was there to write deceased on it, so therefore.

1299
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:00,763
[SPEAKER_06]: More junk.

1300
01:14:01,663 --> 01:14:02,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that all you wanted to say, Actdeft?

1301
01:14:03,404 --> 01:14:05,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything going on in your gaming world this week?

1302
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:09,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's pretty much that.

1303
01:14:09,682 --> 01:14:11,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been gaming that much.

1304
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:14,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been working and other stuff.

1305
01:14:14,943 --> 01:14:18,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm pretty looking forward to Space Invaders Extreme.

1306
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:20,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, me too.

1307
01:14:21,504 --> 01:14:25,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen some of the videos and oh my god, that's awesome.

1308
01:14:25,765 --> 01:14:26,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an awesome game.

1309
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:28,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of F.R.E.S.S.

1310
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it for about three minutes, and it was an awesome three minutes.

1311
01:14:33,048 --> 01:14:34,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely am going to pick this game up on my PSP.

1312
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:37,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a great soundtrack.

1313
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It is on the DS, too.

1314
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:41,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to get it on PSP, just for the heck of it.

1315
01:14:41,672 --> 01:14:43,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be pretty cheap, also.

1316
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $20 on GameStop.

1317
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's $20.

1318
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheap, and I think it'll be good.

1319
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:55,440
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll review the game in full a little later on, as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

1320
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,841
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be looking forward to it.

1321
01:14:58,448 --> 01:15:03,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, take a break from making radio ads this week and definitely play some more games if you can.

1322
01:15:03,773 --> 01:15:08,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to need your help so that we can get SSJ100Matt to win the contest at all games.

1323
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So as soon as I know how he can do that, we'll fill you in.

1324
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1325
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:14,122
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1326

[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1327
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:15,323
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1328
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:15,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1329
01:15:18,031 --> 01:15:25,616
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Meanwhile, do we have any other last minute stories?

1330

01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:41,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Good That was a fun Mario Kart match last night, by the way I don't remember most of it Why not?

1333
01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:42,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you not remember me kicking your ass?

1334
01:15:43,446 --> 01:15:46,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little drinky, drinky

1335
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,431
[SPEAKER_08]: You were drunk playing Mario Kart online?

1336
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I had just gotten home, and I'm like, what am I going to do?

1337
01:15:52,213 --> 01:15:53,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to go to sleep yet.

1338
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:58,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So I popped in Mario Kart, and I was able to navigate the menus perfectly fine.

1339
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:01,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But once I got in the game, it was all downhill from there.

1340
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:04,399
[SPEAKER_06]: No wonder you kept coming in last.

1341
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, did you know that we actually were broadcasting that whole thing on Justin.TV?

1342
01:16:08,101 --> 01:16:08,501
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1343
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:09,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea.

1344
01:16:35,843 --> 01:16:39,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went in there, logged into Mario Kart, and it was like me, Ranma, and then DarkTetsuya.

1345
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:40,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you joined out of nowhere.

1346
01:16:40,824 --> 01:16:43,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, Jimmy must have saw us on just the TV.

1347
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:44,185
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so funny.

1348
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So you were drinking.

1349
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:52,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, when you connect to Wi-Fi, if there's like one of your friends with an open room, it has like a smiley face next to friends.

1350
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:55,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't know that.

1351
01:16:55,628 --> 01:16:56,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's helpful.

1352
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:57,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, what a good case of timing, though.

1353
01:16:58,228 --> 01:16:59,909
[SPEAKER_06]: But shame on you for drinking and driving.

1354
01:17:00,609 --> 01:17:00,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1355
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:04,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess if you're gonna do it, then you gotta do it in Mario Kart.

1356
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's the safest place to drink and drive.

1357
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:07,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1358
01:17:07,919 --> 01:17:08,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1359
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:09,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1360
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:10,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Or GTA 4.

1361
01:17:10,162 --> 01:17:10,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1362
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:36,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Or GTA 4 So that's why you picked Rainbow Road, because I was like, oh god No, I hit random, I did not want to play Rainbow Road, I hate that level so much Oh, okay, okay, alright, because I was cursing you out when you picked it I could tell, everyone was hating me at that point, and if there was voice chat it wouldn't have been very pretty Yeah, maybe that's why Nintendo banned voice chat, so it spares us from a drunken gym Anything, did you call in to talk about something else tonight, Jimmy?

1363
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:38,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally derailed it to Mario Kart No, that was it

1364
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:39,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1365
01:17:39,627 --> 01:17:41,948
[SPEAKER_06]: You were calling to make excuses for your drunken performance last night.

1366
01:17:42,388 --> 01:17:42,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1367
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:43,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's fine.

1368
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,151
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to play a sober match sometime.

1369
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:51,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can represent the OLR crew when we do our big epic battle with Bobby Blackwolf later.

1370
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:52,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1371
01:17:52,676 --> 01:17:52,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1372
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:53,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Jimmy.

1373
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:55,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, thanks for getting me on the show.

1374
01:17:55,778 --> 01:17:56,198
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

1375
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:56,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1376
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:04,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight because we went really long with the match game thing and we want to try to end it at an east hour tonight.

1377
01:18:04,864 --> 01:18:07,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, please finish up any other last minute stories you might have tonight.

1378
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:10,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's see here.

1379
01:18:10,369 --> 01:18:14,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first off, let's talk real quick.

1380
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,593
[SPEAKER_07]: We mentioned a lot of stuff about Rock Band earlier.

1381
01:18:16,934 --> 01:18:21,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, well, first off, they've got some new stuff coming out this week.

1382
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:26,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Hanging on Telephone by Blondie, Train in Vain by The Clash, and Cool Thing by Sonic Youth.

1383
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

1384
01:18:27,901 --> 01:18:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: All going to be $2 or 160 Microsoft points.

1385
01:18:29,782 --> 01:18:29,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1386
01:18:33,598 --> 01:18:36,839
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also some, I guess, tracks on sale.

1387
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,282
[SPEAKER_07]: All sorts of stuff between, I guess, now and June 2nd.

1388
01:18:44,983 --> 01:18:49,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess two per week are going to be half price, or 80 Microsoft points.

1389
01:18:49,785 --> 01:18:57,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I guess, this week there was Crush Crush Crush by Paramore and Boston's rock and roll band.

1390
01:18:58,029 --> 01:18:58,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess...

1391
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:08,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Later this week, there was Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia and Faith No More's We Care A Lot and Leonard Skinner's Gimme Three Steps.

1392
01:19:09,293 --> 01:19:13,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, I'm not sure what's coming up later.

1393
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:14,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see here real quick.

1394
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:24,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week, there's going to be Shockwave, Black Tide, and Sugar Magnolia by Grateful Dead.

1395
01:19:25,106 --> 01:19:31,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the week after that, we care a lot, I guess, Faith No More and All the Small Things by Blink-182.

1396
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,055
[SPEAKER_06]: All the small things.

1397
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:41,441
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, I guess, the last week is going to be Gimme Three Steps by Leonard Skinner and Dirty Little Secret by All American Rejects.

1398
01:19:42,615 --> 01:19:46,879
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want more information, Major Nelson had a story on it, so you can check that out.

1399
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:47,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Half price.

1400
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And Activision during their...

1401
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we'll have to see.

1402
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:27,027
[SPEAKER_07]: This week also, there's a ton of demos being released on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

1403
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:28,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Born Conspiracy is on there.

1404
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Haze on the PlayStation 3.

1405
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:32,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Grid, which you've got to check out.

1406
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:33,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome racing game.

1407
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:34,731
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on both.

1408
01:20:35,471 --> 01:20:42,816
[SPEAKER_07]: And next week, or actually a few weeks from now, June 5th, there's going to be Battlefield Bad Company in case you didn't get into the beta.

1409
01:20:44,237 --> 01:20:52,348
[SPEAKER_07]: New Xbox Live Arcade game coming in June, Vigilante 8 Arcade, which, you know, Vigilante 8 is a fucking awesome game.

1410
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also going to have download content.

1411
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:58,996
[SPEAKER_07]: No word when in June it's coming, but at least have the month nailed down.

1412
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:07,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Turismo has shipped 50 million units total for the entire franchise, and that's globally.

1413
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

1414
01:21:11,402 --> 01:21:12,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1415
01:21:12,763 --> 01:21:13,723
[SPEAKER_07]: This sounds pretty cool.

1416
01:21:13,883 --> 01:21:19,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a little bit of Namco X Capcom, or Cross Capcom.

1417
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:21,087
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1418
01:21:45,174 --> 01:21:46,315
[SPEAKER_07]: All sorts of stuff.

1419
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:51,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is coming from Famitsu Magazine, which has some nifty screenshots for that.

1420
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:55,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like Morgan's in there, and Etna?

1421
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure who else.

1422
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:02,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Donovan, and looks like... Who else?

1423
01:22:02,504 --> 01:22:03,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

1424
01:22:03,504 --> 01:22:04,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of people, though.

1425
01:22:04,365 --> 01:22:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks pretty awesome.

1426
01:22:05,145 --> 01:22:07,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I like AJ Mix's idea for a game in chat.

1427
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:08,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone cross everyone.

1428
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:09,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

1429
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:10,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

1430
01:22:11,942 --> 01:22:12,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is kind of neat.

1431
01:22:12,922 --> 01:22:17,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, I think a few weeks ago when we were trying to show off Crisis Core, it really pissed me off.

1432
01:22:17,884 --> 01:22:22,006
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank God for the homebrew community.

1433
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:28,789
[SPEAKER_07]: On the PSP, there is a new homebrew update called the FUSA Build 032.

1434
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:38,153
[SPEAKER_07]: What it does is allows people with custom firmwares to use the video out and use any sort of core they want.

1435
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:38,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So whether it be

1436
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

1437
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:42,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Composite, Component, S-Video, or D-Terminal.

1438
01:22:43,596 --> 01:22:50,921
[SPEAKER_07]: They can use it on their TV play games, and they have a whole bunch of other options for that.

1439
01:22:51,982 --> 01:22:56,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that should have been done anyways in a firmware update, I think, but whatever.

1440
01:22:58,727 --> 01:22:59,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see here.

1441
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:03,490
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got one more thing here.

1442
01:23:04,191 --> 01:23:06,012
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a... This is kind of funny.

1443
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:07,012
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a...

1444
01:23:08,922 --> 01:23:12,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's a gaming device called Bob that's being released.

1445
01:23:12,685 --> 01:23:23,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it is, is it's a way for parents, they would hook it up to a console of their choice, and they can set time limits for the amount of games that kids can play.

1446
01:23:24,355 --> 01:23:31,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So it kind of looks like a giant calculator, and it will shut the power off after a certain amount of time.

1447
01:23:32,162 --> 01:23:33,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's password protected.

1448
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:33,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1449
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:35,742
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of neat.

1450
01:23:36,162 --> 01:23:38,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, I have to show this to you, Rob.

1451
01:23:38,523 --> 01:23:44,247
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to release this on cell phone games from Gameloft.

1452
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,348
[SPEAKER_07]: They're remaking The Oregon Trail.

1453
01:23:46,949 --> 01:23:47,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1454
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's done all fancy.

1455
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can totally see this coming to the DS at some point.

1456
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, it looks like Oregon Trail does battle.

1457
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:57,561
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird looking.

1458
01:23:57,841 --> 01:23:58,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1459
01:23:58,261 --> 01:23:58,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1460
01:23:58,821 --> 01:24:01,282
[SPEAKER_07]: All fancy like, but yeah, you can check it out.

1461
01:24:01,322 --> 01:24:01,802
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a preview.

1462
01:24:01,822 --> 01:24:06,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look, as long as I can make a character named Jamie and she dies of cholera.

1463
01:24:07,803 --> 01:24:08,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart.

1464
01:24:09,824 --> 01:24:10,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is it.

1465
01:24:12,004 --> 01:24:12,325
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1466
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:15,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, at least it wasn't dysentery because dysentery is so cliche.

1467
01:24:17,466 --> 01:24:17,786
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1468
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:19,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

1469
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:22,147
[SPEAKER_04]: That is why I hope I catch malaria.

1470
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, Jamie, you should check this out on Kotaku.

1471
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:27,804
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the ultimate horse riding simulation.

1472
01:24:27,844 --> 01:24:29,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought of Final Furlong when I saw it.

1473
01:24:30,185 --> 01:24:31,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like an actual horse.

1474
01:24:32,327 --> 01:24:33,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Hump a horse, the game.

1475
01:24:33,308 --> 01:24:33,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeehaw.

1476
01:24:33,788 --> 01:24:35,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And the person's even dressed up.

1477
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a jockey?

1478
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:37,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a horse?

1479
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:38,051
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1480
01:24:39,152 --> 01:24:40,113
[SPEAKER_07]: A horse riding a horse.

1481
01:24:40,173 --> 01:24:41,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, a horse riding a horse.

1482
01:24:42,735 --> 01:24:44,736
[SPEAKER_04]: But a horse is a horse, of course, of course.

1483
01:24:45,517 --> 01:24:45,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1484
01:24:46,838 --> 01:24:48,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Horse riding horse?

1485
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:49,120

[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

1487

1488

[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1489
01:24:57,895 --> 01:24:59,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Reject false icons.

1490
01:24:59,696 --> 01:25:00,977
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have an addition to that now.

1491
01:25:01,838 --> 01:25:03,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Think with your brain, not the TV guide.

1492
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,401
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is reject the common cold.

1493
01:25:08,142 --> 01:25:08,422

1494
01:25:10,094 --> 01:25:13,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to play more ranked Grand Theft Auto 4 multiplayer.

01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:21,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and sorry for people that see me online around 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock Pacific time.

1496
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:23,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because we do our online...

1497
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:30,026
[SPEAKER_07]: inter-employee games and accidentally invited people sometimes to that and I had to kick them.

1498
01:25:30,986 --> 01:25:33,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Jason51.

1499
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:35,470

[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1501
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:39,132
