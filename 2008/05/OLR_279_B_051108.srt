00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast on May 11, 2008.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,480
It's Mother's Day, so if you forgot, you definitely owe your mother like a big bouquet of flowers.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,560
So you should definitely call her if you haven't already, or, you know, whatever motherly figure

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,880
is in your life because, you know, some single parents and so on.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,800
Not everybody necessarily has a mom, but call somebody and tell them you love them.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Damn it.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Love is in the air.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Myself, DarkSakuraLoki here with you on Orange Lounge Radio part B. We're about to get back

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,080
to some news, but first, we have some business to take care of.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:39,640
We have to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest,

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,320
which we're working with AllGames.com to give away a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite Grand

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,440
Theft Auto IV system.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,560
It's only like one of eight that have been made, and we have picked our finalists tonight

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,320
that will compete against all of the other finalists from all the other all-game shows,

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,440
such as, you know, Video Game Outsiders and All Games Interactive and Bobby Black Wolf

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
and so on.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,000
They have all picked their finalists, and they will all do battle for that console.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,720
But just for qualifying, they've won a $25 gift certificate to the all-game store and

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
a t-shirt.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
So enough suspense.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,600
Let's play the winner for you guys one more time, the winner of the Grand Theft Auto IV

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,640
contest on Orange Lounge Radio SSJ 100, Matt.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,000
From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
That's right.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,800
The highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMania

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,560
is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing new songs danced

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
in.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,840
You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:02:11,520
Orange Lounge Radio hosts, like Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, please note there are no real

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,960
songs sung by Dark Sakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lounge Revolution

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,280
team being physically castrated, dying in a bow fire on an ocean of piss while being

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,960
incinerated by an underwater volcano, sorry.

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:39,280
You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan, John D. M. N. Bressler, and a ton of licensed

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,200
music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't want you to hear.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,400
The gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer and you might

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,560
as well just offer torrents on the website.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,040
So come and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,880
When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplayed.com.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,680
It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,720
head while on top of a couple, having sex, shouting, fuck, but I pooped from there, and

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,880
it's only from the Nintendo Wii.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,040
So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a work or breach,

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,840
bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,000
If you do, Loki might dress up as Tingle.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,880
Not a guarantee.

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,240
See, he says at the end there, not guaranteed, Loki, that you will in fact dress up as Tingle.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,960
It's still implying, though, that it was sales of...

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Yeah.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
All right, so there it is.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,200
Congrats, SSJ100, Matt, but a big round of applause, everybody, please, to our finalists.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,600
They were all very good, and everybody that participated, we couldn't play them all in

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
the final round.

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I get two claps.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
That's all you got for your mouth.

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
All right.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Thank you.

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Now, here's the thing, though.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,040
Now we have to all throw our support behind SSJ100, Matt, as he moves into the final round,

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,880
because I'll tell you what, because it's a bunch of OLR in-jokes, you know when they

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,200
play that on All Games Interactive or however they decide to do the final, there's a lot

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,080
of people that are going to listen to that and go, what the hell is that?

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,720
Like, I don't get it.

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,200
So we all have to support SSJ100, Matt, now by making sure in the final voting phase,

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,620
we all go and vote for him, because we want him to win.

66
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,860
We want to say that the winner came from OLR, so be sure to throw your support behind him

67
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
in the finalist round.

68
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,820
We'll give you more information on that next week when the voting should be up.

69
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,480
So check for that on our website as well a little later this week.

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
All right.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
So congrats, SSJ100, Matt.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,660
Another giveaway to come later in the show, that res code finally going to be given away

73
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,880
to somebody, thank God, in a new game coming up a little bit later.

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
But first, more news.

75
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,080
Loki, let's go back to some gaming news.

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,440
I don't want to watch the stock market too much, but I guess if you were hoping that

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Tari was going to make a big turnaround and become this really profitable company, well,

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
no.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,400
In fact, Nasdaq has actually delisted them from the stock exchange, because they have

80
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,240
failed to, well, basically, they failed to submit the year-end financials, and, you know,

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
before that, the market value was way too low.

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,520
They have been dropped, dropped like an American Idol contestant who just couldn't make it.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
Or an American Idol contestant's father from backstage.

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,080
Did you read about that?

85
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Yes, I did.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Funny stuff.

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Oh, wait.

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Do we have more in the saga of one of the Davids?

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I forget.

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm not letting this show turn into American Idol chat.

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Not, not, not.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,600
Yes, apparently someone's abusive daddy, you know, a la Michael Jackson.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Shut up!

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Apparently, there's a certain booboo, if you remember last week, with kind of doing, there's

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,480
a cover of a song that he did that, you know, had the lyrics, beautiful girls in it.

96
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
That caused him a lot of money.

97
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
I hate you guys.

98
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
And besides, that was cheap anyways.

99
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,520
That was as cheap as that one chick who was saying all the, like, American Jesus theme

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
songs.

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,680
Anyways, so yes, Atari got delisted from Nasdaq, and, um, yeah.

102
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
They're just going down a slippery slope.

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,560
Hopefully someone will buy them, and it will be, you know, a little bit more than all Dragon

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,960
Ball Z Atari remake games.

105
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,800
Well, we reached out to Atari for comment, and this is all they had to say.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,280
Bad joke.

107
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Nobody's gonna get it.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Alright.

109
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Chirp, chirp.

110
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Take a shot.

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Let's go on to some more.

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,960
Please tell me somebody got it.

113
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I got it.

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Alright.

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
It just wasn't funny.

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Alright.

117
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
No, I got it, but, you know, isn't that an Amco game?

118
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
No!

119
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,200
It was on the Atari 2016, forget it.

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,680
It was on the 2600, but it's an Amco game.

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,360
Atari licensed it for the 2600 and then shit all over it, if you remember.

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
Alright, forget it.

123
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,400
Little Big Planet.

124
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,480
Let's talk about, like, new and exciting games as opposed to games that were out, like, twenty

125
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
years ago.

126
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,600
Uh, Little Big Planet will be coming out in October.

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,140
This was announced at the PlayStation Day 2008 event in London.

128
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,520
It's from Kazurai himself.

129
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,260
He has confirmed that Little Big Planet's gonna be making its way in October, but one

130
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,960
thing you should be aware of is that, uh, the open beta, not happening.

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,440
So if you were looking forward to the public beta that was, like, promised several times

132
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
for the game, uh, nope.

133
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,840
The public beta's going away.

134
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
So surprised.

135
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,840
You know, a promise broken by Sony, gee.

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,880
Hopefully there'll be a demo or something, but don't hold your breath.

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
You'll probably just have to wait for the game to come out.

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,360
Let me just add another check mark on the board there.

139
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Uh, yeah.

140
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Alright.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,480
But Little Big Planet will be making its way in October, um, unless it gets delayed again.

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Who never knows.

143
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Who knows?

144
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,920
It'll be all sorts of awesome whenever it comes out.

145
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Alright.

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
So, moving on.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,720
Well, for things that are to be, uh, coming out, as, uh, mentioned is, uh, Home, which

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,680
has been pushed back, pushed back, turned around, upside down, set on fire, and dropped

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,720
in, said Underwater Volcano, um, is going to be getting a fall release, which is, uh,

150
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,560
been told to us by SCEED President, uh, David Reeves, and said, he's quoted as saying maybe

151
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,000
we were too ambitious with the non-gaming applications within Home, getting sponsors

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and stuff like that.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But don't worry.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,380
You know, in the meantime, Sony has your back.

155
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,680
There is another social engineering game that they have out right now.

156
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,280
It's gonna have a pretty large community.

157
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,640
It's called Go Outside.

158
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,160
But no, it's centralized around large cities.

159
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,760
However, it's not quite as prestigious as, say, Home.

160
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,020
The game is actually homeless, and, um, you can find yourself participating in wonderful

161
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:58,040
activities like sleeping on a park bench, um, spewing out obscenities, um, talking to

162
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,200
a wall, and, um, just not being cared for.

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,020
I need to do a quick poll in chat right now.

165
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Quick poll in chat.

166
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,200
All right.

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Which joke was funnier?

168
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,160
Loki's homeless joke or Rob's Atari joke?

169
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,080
Place vote now in chat.

170
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
In the main chat room.

171
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I think, you know what's funnier?

172
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Which joke was funnier?

173
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
You know what's funnier?

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Tonight's show.

175
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Tonight's show is hilarious.

176
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Hilarious!

177
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
All right.

178
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Loki, go to the next story.

179
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Please.

180
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Oh, wait, wait.

181
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,300
Oh, hold on.

182
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
We have the quick poll.

183
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Results are in.

184
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,800
Uh, Rob's Atari joke.

185
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Rob's joke.

186
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Atari.

187
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Rob.

188
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Rob.

189
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Rob's Atari joke.

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Rob's.

191
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Rob's Atari joke.

192
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Because Rob used the Atari Pac-Man dying sound.

193
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Rob.

194
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Rob's Atari joke.

195
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Rob.

196
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Rob.

197
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Look at that.

198
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I rock.

199
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Whatever.

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Love you, Loki.

201
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Um, so this is a big surprise.

202
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
There's rumors now that Daxter and Wipeout Pulse are going to be ported to the PS2.

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Really?

204
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,360
PSP games to be imported to the PS2?

205
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
That's a first.

206
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,360
So, and this is coming from Juke's Video France, and they were just stating that, of course,

207
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
those two games are being ported to the PS2.

208
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,920
I would say that's a pretty safe guess, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it, so.

209
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,400
Not a big surprise.

210
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,960
All right.

211
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,280
So now we've got to downgrade our games to get them to sell more.

212
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Is that basically what this is?

213
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,680
Well, here's the thing, here's the thing, too, is when they port them over, they don't

214
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,560
enhance, like, any of the graphics or anything.

215
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,880
In fact, I believe Ratchet and Clank's size matters didn't look that good on the PS2.

216
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,680
Twisted Metal, pretty cool.

217
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
Silent Hill Origins, pretty cool.

218
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,640
But just, I don't know.

219
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
Least they could do is, like, upgrade the graphics a little bit.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
Yeah, or put them on PS3.

221
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
Upgrade, go all the way to PS3.

222
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Why not?

223
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
Yeah, who knows.

224
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, we had another comment in the quick poll.

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,000
Uh, I would have voted for Loki if he would dress up as Tingle.

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
Sorry, don't care.

227
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,040
That was from Black Wolf, by the way.

228
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,240
I don't need his sink and vote.

229
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,680
Or his friendship on the PlayStation Network.

230
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,440
Are you going to unfriend Bobby Black Wolf?

231
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
Well, that would involve me turning on my PlayStation 3.

232
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,200
That would be a controversy right there.

233
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,640
All right.

234
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,800
Just kidding.

235
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Bobby's awesome.

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,240
Here's another game we can try to beat Bobby at in the future.

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Bizarre Creations.

238
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,280
They are making a new racing game.

239
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,400
You might remember, they are no longer really involved with Project Gotham Racing.

240
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,760
Microsoft now owns the IP to that, and will be, I guess, developing the inevitable Project

241
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,040
Gotham Racing 5.

242
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,360
Bizarre Creations is making a new franchise that will be, I guess, published by Activision,

243
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
and it's coming out in the 2010 fiscal year.

244
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,600
Now that could mean, like, holiday season 09, because the 2010 fiscal year starts April

245
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
1st of 2009.

246
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,320
The quote from the conference call earlier this week, Bizarre is deep in development

247
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,120
on two multi-platform titles, and we are looking forward to the release of our first new racing

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,440
IP in fiscal 2010, which already looks very strong.

249
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,920
And I just hope, like, I don't know, the thing about Project Gotham for me is that it's a

250
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,200
little heavy on the car shop, you know, and tuning your car and stuff, and I just want

251
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,360
to play, like, a really easy pick-up-and-race type game like F-Zero.

252
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,080
I think that's why I like F-Zero and Mario Kart.

253
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
They're really easy.

254
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,160
I want it easy and fast.

255
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,960
That's why I like F-Zero, because you get to drive so fast.

256
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,760
Like I seriously still say F-Zero GX is one of my favorite racing games ever.

257
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,520
This is great.

258
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
So.

259
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,760
We'll see, though, what Bizarre has in store for us, because, you know, they might just

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,720
try something completely new out of left field that's going to make me go, da-da-da-da, want.

261
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Might you say that, Dark Sakura?

262
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Da-da-da-want.

263
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Ooh.

264
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
We'll see.

265
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,520
Well, speaking of stuff that came through via conference call.

266
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
How's that for tie-in?

267
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:05,800
It was actually stated by Activision Publishing CEO Mike Griffith that Guitar Hero has surpassed

268
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,960
15 million in individual song downloads.

269
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,120
So I guess Rock Band's got a little bit more to catch up with, but then again, Guitar Hero

270
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,360
has been out longer, so.

271
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
In shorter time, Harmonix hit 10 million.

272
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,760
So I think that, look at it in perspective of time and then see who's doing better.

273
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
That's what I say.

274
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,800
I sense a little bit of favoritism on your part.

275
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,880
Especially since Rock Band already had to deal with Guitar Hero's...

276
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Whoa!

277
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Sorry about that.

278
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Okay.

279
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
I'm setting up for something later.

280
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,360
Don't pay attention to that.

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,520
But since Guitar Hero was already out and already had a loyal fan base when Rock Band

282
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
came out.

283
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,900
So to hit 10 million after all that, I think Rock Band's got...

284
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,760
And I'm looking at this just by terms of numbers and time, that I think Rock Band's the more

285
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
impressive.

286
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Hmm.

287
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,840
Well, you know, I don't know.

288
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,320
Guitar Hero, I still like it because I think it's more fun to play guitar on Guitar Hero

289
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
than it is on Rock Band.

290
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
But Rock Band's definitely the better party game.

291
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
I like hitting things.

292
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Fuck that shit.

293
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Guitar Freaks.

294
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
I don't know who you guys...

295
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
No.

296
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Guitar Freaks is kind of...

297
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
No!

298
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Guitar Freaks!

299
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
No.

300
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Sorry.

301
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Where's your loyalty?

302
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
No loyalty.

303
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Sorry.

304
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I defected.

305
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Hey, I still love Beatmania 2DX.

306
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
I will always have a soft...

307
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
And Keyboardmania.

308
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,440
And Keyboardmania, I will always have a soft, squishy spot in my heart for Keyboardmania.

309
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,960
By the way, completely unrelated, and Loki, once you mentioned it, I had to look it up,

310
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:43,200
and I think that's the most hilarious thing I've ever heard for the American Idol thing.

311
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You know what?

312
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm not derailing this show with your Idol chat.

313
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,160
Hey, it's only a few more weeks, and then it's over.

314
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm the...

315
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Thank God.

316
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Oh my God.

317
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I don't believe this.

318
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm the reality TV whore of you three.

319
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,160
I am hosting a freaking survivor game on LiveJournal right now.

320
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,600
That's what a whore I am for reality TV.

321
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
And it's you two that do reality...

322
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
Dude, I explained the other night this isn't reality TV.

323
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,840
It's a talent contest.

324
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
There's a difference.

325
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,880
It's not a bunch of people acting like retards.

326
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,080
You don't see anything into their personal life on the show.

327
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,400
I like people acting like retards.

328
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
She doesn't have a point.

329
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
It is a contest.

330
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
It is a contest.

331
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,360
You're not looking at how these people are living in their daily lives.

332
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
And thank God for that.

333
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,320
They just interview them.

334
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,520
You're not following them as they're trying to build a hut out of coconut leaves and duct tape.

335
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,200
Wouldn't it be more fun if the Idols did have to build...

336
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
No.

337
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
No.

338
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
No.

339
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
No.

340
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
No.

341
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
No.

342
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
No.

343
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Because, you see, this is why I don't watch any of the results show, and I just read the

344
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,160
news about watching tons of Ford commercials being their little musical numbers.

345
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,480
I actually have not watched a physical episode on TV this year.

346
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,280
All I have to say is I'm missing the Survivor Micronesia finale tonight to be here, and

347
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,240
if you spoil it in chat, I will punch you in the face, and it will hurt.

348
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
You've got TiVo.

349
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
I know.

350
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
But still.

351
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,560
You have TiVo.

352
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,760
I have YouTube on my phone at work.

353
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
All right.

354
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,040
We do have gaming news at some point during the show tonight, yes?

355
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Yes.

356
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Yes.

357
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,000
So this is kind of an interesting thing.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,320
I guess it's got some interesting bullet points to it.

359
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,400
Guitar Hero On Tour, of course, coming out in June.

360
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,240
Well, there's rumors now that they are...

361
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,080
Activision is partnering with Nintendo to release Nintendo DS bundles that will include

362
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,880
the DS system as well as Guitar Hero On Tour.

363
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,560
It will be the first third-party kind of combo pack that they've done with the DS so far.

364
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,440
So that's kind of neat, whoring the game out a bit, yes, I guess.

365
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I don't know.

366
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,760
I would say that you would need the black and red or crimson black DS so to fully look

367
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,720
pretty cool with this, but I don't know.

368
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,360
It's neat, I guess.

369
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I think...

370
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I was going to say.

371
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
I think that they're doing...

372
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,680
I think Guitar Hero 4 is coming out in DS2, so you're not going to have to worry about

373
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,240
playing on tour for a long time.

374
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,480
Are they really going to move that many DS units with this one game?

375
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,680
I think it's going to sell pretty well.

376
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,120
It's innovative, I guess.

377
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,120
It's innovative, I guess.

378
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,280
It's an interesting peripheral, let me put it that way.

379
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
You know what?

380
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
What?

381
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know if it's an original idea at all, because the Wonderswan had the BeatMania wheel.

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Scratch table.

383
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
But this is different, this is much different.

384
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,440
There's been games that's had add-ons of a similar nature.

385
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
I'm not saying that add-ons...

386
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,200
I think it's an interesting add-on, because I know when I'm thinking Guitar Hero for the

387
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,040
DS before they ever showed off this guitar grip thing.

388
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm thinking you tap in the screen to be the music type thing.

389
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,360
So this is definitely a lot better than that.

390
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I don't know.

391
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
It'd be interesting to see what they do with it.

392
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,080
Definitely not going to do a PSP version, because that'd be weird.

393
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,280
I don't know how the hell they would do that.

394
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,000
All right, well, more Guitar Hero news.

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,320
That is that apparently Guitar Hero is supposed to be taking a big leap.

396
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,160
This is again from that same conference call earlier this week from Activision.

397
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,120
It was the CEO of publishing, Mike Griffith, said, for the holiday we will provide a significant

398
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,840
leap forward in innovation for Guitar Hero worldwide on all platforms.

399
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,960
Meaning the PS3, the PS2, 360, DS, Wii, more information coming in the coming weeks.

400
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,360
Notice how there was no confirmation about the multi-instrument rumor going around about

401
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,120
Guitar Hero 4, but is that really innovation?

402
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
If they just...

403
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Well, it's innovation in their eyes, because they haven't done it before, therefore it's

404
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,040
a first for them.

405
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
I don't know.

406
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
Something tells me there will be some type of instrument we haven't thought of yet that's

407
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
going to be in it somehow.

408
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,520
I mean, come on, Rob.

409
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,820
Look at the Wii, okay, and the Wii Wheel when they made that announcement.

410
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,720
That was a big step in innovation to them, despite the fact that there had been third

411
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
party games that had done that since the Wii launch.

412
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
So it's retarded.

413
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,560
They just pat themselves on the back and stuff, fluff themselves, I don't know what.

414
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
But it's just, it's retarded.

415
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,160
Nice.

416
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:32,120
So, yeah, so Guitar Hero 4, we'll see, we'll get more news on it later, I guess, and I'm

417
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,880
sure we'll be shocked and awed, but not really, because we already kind of figured it out.

418
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Are we shocked and awed?

419
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Nope.

420
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Are we just going awed?

421
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Maybe.

422
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Well, guess what else should be getting some downloadable content?

423
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
What?

424
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Well, sort of.

425
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,680
Samba de Amigo on Wii.

426
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,000
Wait, wait, you mean downloadable content on the Wii?

427
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How is this possible?

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Explain yourself.

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,960
There is, they were taking a look at the cover for Samba de Amigo, and at the top is Wii's

430
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,680
Pay to Play logo.

431
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,000
So it could be indicative of some downloadable content.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Pay to Play?

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,240
Yeah, that was something that was announced back at Game Developers Conference.

434
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Really?

435
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Tell me more about it, because I forget.

436
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,240
It's a little orange thing that looks like the Wi-Fi logo, but it's, you know, orange

437
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,600
that says Pay to Play on it, and basically going to indicate that there's going to be

438
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,140
downloadable content for the game.

439
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,920
I hope it's not, oh, look, Samba de Amigo, you have to pay a quarter every time you play

440
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
this game, you know, that goes...

441
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
You know...

442
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I doubt it.

443
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
You know what I want instead of online play?

444
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Maracas?

445
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,680
Where are my maracas?

446
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm sure some third-party company will put out cheap plastic maracas for your...

447
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Maraca attachments?

448
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Yeah.

449
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Why not?

450
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,800
I want my maracas, and I want to pose.

451
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,280
Damn it, I'm just going to bust out the new cast.

452
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,960
I'm sure the posing will be there.

453
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
I want maracas!

454
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,360
We could develop our own maraca attachment.

455
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Here's the thing, though.

456
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,780
I bet you anything, because the space on the Wii is so limited, I bet you anything it is

457
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,920
not pay to download content, it's pay to unlock content.

458
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Because why not?

459
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,100
We're already on the 360 with games like Katamari, and we need to stop referring to these things

460
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,040
as downloadable content and call them what they are.

461
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,160
You are paying to unlock something already on the disc.

462
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,080
You know, though, I don't know if that might be the case, because, I mean, this stuff could

463
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,480
be, like, MP3 format or something very similar.

464
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,320
You're not actually making the music to the game, it's just going along with it.

465
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Perhaps you could...

466
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
The Dreamcast ones were actually downloadable.

467
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,200
And did you actually download the whole songs?

468
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes, I did.

469
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Wow.

470
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
But I thought you just got the little...

471
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You stored them on your VMU.

472
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Huh.

473
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,760
And they could maybe allow downloading content to, like, an external device, like your SD

474
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
memory card.

475
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,160
I also had Samba 2000, remember?

476
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,460
Oh yeah, I always forgot Samba de Amigo actually had a sequel.

477
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,000
Remember when we would do the New Year's parties at my house that you would actually show up

478
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
for?

479
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh yeah.

480
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,760
And we would bust out Samba de Amigo at least three years in a row?

481
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Good times.

482
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I love Samba de Amigo.

483
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,320
Because it was all about playing the Burning Rangers theme.

484
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
I almost want to get the Wii one, just for retro sake.

485
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm going to get the Wii one.

486
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I mean, it has Take On Me.

487
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
At least the old one did.

488
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,040
I don't know if the new one does.

489
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,780
We'll see.

490
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
We will see.

491
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,200
And what, Burning Rangers?

492
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,760
Well, while we're waiting for actual download content on the Wii, whether, I guess, Samba

493
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,080
de Amigo is going to be the first one or not, in the meantime, though, in July, we are going

494
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,120
to be getting something not quite downloadable, but expanding on with Rock Band Track Pack

495
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Volume 1.

496
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,720
It's coming to the PlayStation 2 and the Wii.

497
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,120
What's kind of neat about this game, actually, it's not really adding on to the game.

498
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,640
I mean, it's almost like its own game.

499
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
It has its own songs.

500
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,600
They've got a list of about, I want to say there's, looks like, 10, 15 tracks there.

501
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,000
And all stuff that's currently available on Xbox Live or Kitten PlayStation Network, like

502
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,840
30 Seconds to Mars, The Kill, Blink-182, all the small things, Kiss, Calling Dr. Love,

503
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
and so on.

504
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:11,040
And so if you actually, if you don't own Rock Band, you can just buy this for like $29.99,

505
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
if you want.

506
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,280
I guess it will contain 20 songs.

507
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Wait, so even if you don't own normal Rock Band, you can still buy this disc?

508
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Yes.

509
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,240
So it's not like an append disc where you have to have the normal game?

510
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
No.

511
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
You can actually just play it by itself.

512
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Interesting.

513
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't know why people would do that.

514
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,960
I don't know why either, but I mean like if you own a PlayStation 3, say for example,

515
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,080
and you know, you happen to have one that does still play PlayStation 2 discs, you can

516
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,680
use the PlayStation 3 guitars, because they're the same as the PlayStation 2 guitars, to

517
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,800
play this game.

518
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Or drums.

519
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
So.

520
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Interesting.

521
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Yeah.

522
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Alright, well.

523
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Or you could just pay to download the songs.

524
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I mean, you could just do that.

525
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,400
Well, you know, or if you own a PlayStation 2 and a Wii, or a Wii I guess, you don't really

526
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
have the option.

527
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Thank you, Nintendo.

528
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,920
Well, there's some more Rock Band news that's kind of interesting this week, and it has

529
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,680
to do with more Rock Band tracks, but this time it's free tracks, and we like free, but

530
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,120
it's kind of the way that you get them, which is very interesting.

531
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,920
The band Disturbed apparently is going to be having some tracks in Rock Band, and the

532
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,920
only way you get this is by pre-ordering their latest CD, which I think is Indestructible?

533
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Is that what it's called?

534
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,080
You pre-order this CD, and then you actually can get the songs that apparently will not

535
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,400
be going public until June.

536
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,560
I guess it'll go on the public download service then.

537
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,040
You can get these songs.

538
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,360
So kind of an interesting band tie in there.

539
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,960
Also, South Park season 11, which kind of ironic if you ask me, because South Park season

540
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,160
11 is the one that has the episode that spoofs Guitar Hero, and you even see the picture

541
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,660
on the cover of the season 11 DVDs is that it has Stan and Kyle from that episode playing

542
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Guitar Hero.

543
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,560
What's interesting is apparently if you buy that DVD set, you get three Rock Band tracks

544
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,200
with it, and it's not the first time South Park would have tied into Rock Band, because

545
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,960
think Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld is one of the unlocked songs in the game,

546
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
which is pretty awesome.

547
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,280
I hope it's actual South Park songs.

548
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,840
I hope they're South Park songs, too.

549
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
Like DVDA, Now You're a Man.

550
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,520
Or Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucker.

551
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,960
I love some of the stuff from the movie.

552
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,220
That would be great.

553
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
Or what was this song?

554
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
Little Boy, You're Going to Hell.

555
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Remember that?

556
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,920
It also has a good guitar riff in it.

557
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
That'd be great.

558
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
We'll see.

559
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
All right.

560
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,000
In the meantime, we're going to take a little trip to our mailbag.

561
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,200
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura rips

562
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,480
open the email bag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you guys,

563
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,720
and unfortunately, though, it's Slim Pickens in the mailbag this week.

564
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,600
Sounds like not a lot of folks emailed us.

565
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,480
Dark Sakura's going to pick her two favorite emails tonight to read for you right now,

566
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,920
but if you want to email us for a future week, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

567
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Dark Sakura, take it away.

568
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,660
Well, I did get a couple from Rob with Two Bs, but I'm actually still reading over them,

569
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,200
so I'll have to save them for next week.

570
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,700
First one comes from Katamari's Forever, a good Sunday to you, O-L-R. That's so pleasant.

571
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,740
I'd like to start my letter regarding what I wrote last week.

572
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,440
Having copied down what Act Deaf said on Part B two weeks ago, I tried removing Photo Channel,

573
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,640
but since I didn't download it in the first place, it wasn't there to delete.

574
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,040
I would also like to state that since the show reaches 1 a.m. in Michigan, I usually

575
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,880
go live during Part A and go to sleep during the beginning of Part B. I can't thank you

576
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,640
enough for providing a podcast through your RSS feed so that I can listen later.

577
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:39,120
Now, I would like to address a popular issue that I've seen recently in games, their ratings.

578
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,480
It seems that every new release title gets to be a number one on aggregate sites like

579
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,440
Gamer Kings, only to fall down to the top 30 a week later.

580
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,080
Do exclusive reviews usually skew opinions, hence the 100% that a PS3 version of Grand

581
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,120
Theft Auto IV is getting?

582
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,280
I mean, sure, the first reviews usually spew out love, but it's usually the first people

583
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,680
who influence the next, right?

584
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,880
If so, for example, GameSpot gave a game like Okami for Wii a 9.0 when the other reviewers

585
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
follow suit.

586
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,680
I guess it's just buzz.

587
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Which brings me to my other point.

588
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,440
Where's Bioshock?

589
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,360
In a mere amount of months, the 2007 game of the year just vanished out of thin air.

590
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,400
Nowadays, I don't hear a peep about this legendary game anymore, but just to whoop to and braw

591
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,240
and testimonials about GTA IV, seriously, I've got a friend who calls this game quote

592
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,280
the truth.

593
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,920
Are gamers really that ADD?

594
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Yes.

595
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Yes.

596
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,640
Two random things I want to address.

597
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Why does Rob hate Toadette?

598
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,000
She's just the same as Toad, and Mario Kart Wii is very nice, but bikes seem unusable

599
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,120
when playing with the Wii wheel.

600
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,200
Okay, here's the thing about Toadette and why I don't like her is, A, Toad's voice,

601
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,440
I love Toad, but his voice is kind of annoying, I'll admit.

602
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,040
I like Toad circa Super Mario 2.

603
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,400
Toadette takes that voice and makes it 20 times even more like fingernails on chalkboard.

604
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,520
But here's the other thing about Nintendo that I kind of don't like the little pattern

605
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:17,880
they developed where it was like Mario and Wario, Luigi and Waluigi, Donkey Kong and

606
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Diddy Kong.

607
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,000
Everybody has this freaking relative, right?

608
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,720
So by the time Toad and Toadette came around, I was like, okay, enough.

609
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,000
Waluigi's funny because his name's sort of a pun.

610
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,760
And so I take out all my hatred on Toadette.

611
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,400
Well, they need Peach and her slutty cousin Cherry.

612
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Here's Daisy.

613
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,120
Ah, who gives a shit about Daisy?

614
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Are you thinking of that episode of Drawn Together?

615
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I don't know.

616
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Never mind.

617
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Never mind.

618
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Can I continue?

619
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
You may.

620
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,840
Sorry about the long letter, I'll be sure to talk about something else next time.

621
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,280
Katamari's forever.

622
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,480
Change is inevitable, except at the Olive Garden where endless soup, salad, and breadsticks

623
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,040
are $9.95 every day, excluding Australia LOL.

624
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,480
I love how all of our emails now have to end their email with some type of Home of the

625
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,600
Never Ending or Olive Garden reference.

626
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Love it.

627
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Hey Sky, Dark Sakura, and Loki, thank you for playing my entry for the contest on the

628
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
show.

629
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,360
And I'm glad you guys liked it and said it was great, that really means a lot to me.

630
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,760
It's a shame that few people are entering to win, but I guess that most people listening

631
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,400
already own an Xbox 360 or PS3.

632
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm curious to hear the other entries for the contest though, so keep us informed.

633
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Oh yeah, I've got a story for you guys about how I got to know your podcast.

634
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,840
I was actually looking for podcasts with lounge music, so I typed lounge podcast and something

635
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,760
like that into Google and it led me to your website.

636
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,560
I downloaded an episode and the beginning was like Sky's famous intro beginning with

637
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,920
video games, video gaming, and gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

638
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,880
Being a gamer myself, I thought, hey, I'll check this out, and I actually laughed my

639
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,640
ass off.

640
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,440
And I was immediately hooked, mouthpiece.

641
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,760
So there you have it, a somewhat unusual way of getting to know you guys, but the name

642
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,520
Orange Lounge Radio really paid off.

643
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,840
Which is funny because a lot of times I think we haven't been discovered because our title

644
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,640
does not have game in it, and people are like, what does Orange Lounge have to do with video

645
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
games?

646
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
So it's just kind of funny that the reverse worked.

647
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
It's ditter.

648
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
That's great.

649
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,880
By the way, Sky, you do sound like Lowslow from GTA a lot, smile face, but that's not

650
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,560
a bad thing because he's so funny.

651
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Oh, okay then.

652
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,760
I forgive you.

653
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,720
Keep up the great show, lots of love from Belgium, Martin.

654
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,160
Okay, now DarkSakura, it occurred to me you weren't here last week, so you didn't hear

655
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,720
his entry, but the problem was he was ineligible because-

656
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
I did hear it.

657
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
You did?

658
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
I played it the week before.

659
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Oh.

660
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
This was the really funny-

661
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Oh, you know what it was?

662
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,480
I didn't play it on air that time you heard it.

663
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Yeah.

664
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Okay, then you've heard it.

665
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
All right.

666
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Yeah.

667
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
But we played it on air last week, right?

668
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Yeah.

669
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
All right.

670
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Yeah.

671
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
That's what I thought, and you weren't here last week, so.

672
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

673
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
What?

674
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
We have one more.

675
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Okay.

676
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Better be short.

677
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
It is.

678
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
It's really short.

679
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
All right.

680
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
It's from GS68.

681
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
All right.

682
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Hey, OLR crew.

683
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
I've got seven words for Black Wolf.

684
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,760
What do you have against the ferret?

685
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
What is the ferret?

686
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
I don't know.

687
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
We'll have to ask.

688
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Where's my baby?

689
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Where's my baby?

690
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I hit him last week when you weren't here.

691
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
You butt.

692
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
No, I don't know.

693
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
I actually don't know.

694
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I seriously don't know where the ferret is.

695
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
It's somewhere around here.

696
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
He's hiding from Bobby.

697
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Hopefully I threw him away.

698
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
No.

699
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
No, I'm just kidding.

700
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
He's hiding from Bobby.

701
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
I think it's-

702
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
You traumatized the baby ferret.

703
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,480
I think there's a little bit of a rivalry between our mascot, the ferret, and Bobby,

704
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,800
and I'm not sure who it belongs to, Bobby or Super Happy Fun Time Show, but Clicky the

705
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Pen.

706
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
I think there's some type of rivalry there.

707
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Clicky the Pen.

708
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Yes.

709
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,240
But the ferret has cuteness.

710
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
That's true.

711
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
But the pen goes click.

712
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,640
But the pens are also useful.

713
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
All right.

714
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Anyhow.

715
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,480
Ferrets are useful too because you can throw them at your co-host.

716
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
If you can find it.

717
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
All right.

718
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Hey.

719
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Watch.

720
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I'll find another ferret.

721
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,400
All right.

722
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,720
That's it for the email this week.

723
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,960
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you have some emails you would like to contribute.

724
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:07,020
But we've got some more gaming news, and then we are minutes away from a brand new OLR game.

725
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,680
You don't even know what it is yet.

726
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,120
I think it's going to be fun.

727
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm excited.

728
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,960
Or it will suck and we'll never play it again.

729
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
That's what happens to games.

730
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,160
They're either really good or they suck and we never play them again.

731
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
All right.

732
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,960
So let's go over to Loki for another story.

733
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,200
All right.

734
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,240
So this isn't a big surprise because they were talking that Bazaar was going to be working

735
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,840
on a new Bond game.

736
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,880
Well, may not be Bazaar, but apparently Treyarch is working on a new Bond game and it's going

737
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,500
to be Bond Quantum of Solace, which is going to be released the third quarter of this year

738
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,960
along with the movie.

739
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,520
It will be running on the Call of Duty 4 engine, which, I mean, hey, if they're going to pick

740
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,160
a first person shooter engine to run it on, that's probably the best one to pick.

741
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,600
So that should be pretty awesome.

742
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,400
Maybe another GoldenEye, you know, because the multiplayer in Call of Duty 4 is pretty

743
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
awesome.

744
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,240
So we'll have to see.

745
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,800
But the film is being released in the UK on October 31st, November 7th in North America.

746
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,680
Does that mean that we'll actually get the game then?

747
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
Or do you think we'll have to wait for the DVD?

748
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,520
I think it will come out fourth.

749
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,980
Why does it say third quarter?

750
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
It's fourth quarter.

751
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,680
I guess third quarter financial quarter, I guess, for them.

752
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,960
But yeah, fourth quarter.

753
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,920
So that would make sense.

754
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,320
All right.

755
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,460
Well, other fours in the industry this week, Doom 4.

756
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
That's right.

757
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,600
Doom 4 was announced this week.

758
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,540
It's been a few years since we've had an entry in the Doom franchise.

759
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,820
There was Doom 3 a few years ago, like I remember that was on the Xbox One, but Doom 4 is on

760
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,160
its way.

761
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,280
And CEO Todd Hollensheet said this week in a press release, quote, Doom is part of the

762
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,320
ID software DNA and demands the greatest talent and brightest minds in the industry to bring

763
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,360
the next installment of our flagship franchise to Earth.

764
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,280
There are no other details given at this time.

765
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,240
Speculation is that ID's Tech 5 engine will be used.

766
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
And who knows?

767
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,040
And story-wise, who knows where this game could go.

768
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,140
But then again, if the movie didn't kill the franchise, then, you know, it could go anywhere.

769
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
So Doom 4.

770
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,440
Are you excited about Doom 4?

771
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
No.

772
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,600
I thought Doom 3 looked really awesome, but I don't know, it didn't have the charm of

773
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,880
Doom 1 and Doom 2 for me.

774
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,080
I never really liked Doom.

775
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,680
Are you playing Doom for the charm?

776
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Yes, for the charm.

777
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,700
I like Doom 1 and 2 for the mods, but that's about it.

778
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,600
I didn't really care for the games.

779
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,720
I didn't even really get in the Quake either.

780
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,920
Duke Nukem 3D, that was my game.

781
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,200
You know what I liked about Doom?

782
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,360
I just, you know, I don't know, Wolfenstein, that was a good game.

783
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,480
Just Doom didn't do it for me.

784
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,880
I think mainly Doom didn't do it for me because at the time my PC couldn't run it.

785
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,200
Only had one meg of RAM, so, you know, it was a little tough to run that game.

786
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,400
Your friend and mine, Bobby Black Wolf in chat, says ID makes great engines.

787
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,520
They don't make great games.

788
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,720
I liked the first Doom because, first of all, it had a difficulty level called Hurt Me Plenty.

789
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,520
And, secondly, the Wolfenstein levels.

790
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Alright.

791
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,120
It's all about IDDQD and IDBFG.

792
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,840
Don't forget Hexen and how frickin' awesome that game is.

793
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Hexen was great because of the NRA code.

794
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,200
All weapons.

795
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Hi.

796
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Alright, we are gonna...

797
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
In god mode with Satan.

798
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Awesome.

799
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,960
Alright, we are gonna go to the Skype line.

800
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,720
In fact, if you heard a little background noise, it's because we already picked it up,

801
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,040
where we have two people sitting on the Skype line right now, if I'm not mistaken.

802
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,800
Toshin, you are there, correct?

803
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Yes, I am.

804
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Hi, Toshin.

805
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
How are you?

806
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm good.

807
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Alright.

808
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
And FootyMonster, you're there too, right?

809
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Yep, I am here.

810
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,080
How are you doing, FootyMonster?

811
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Doing very well, actually.

812
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Thank you.

813
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Alright.

814
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Now, we've got a little bit of a score to settle in.

815
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,720
I don't even know how this came about, but it turned out that we have this res code we've

816
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,840
been trying to give away for, like, I don't know, like two months, and somehow we found

817
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,520
out that you two didn't have it.

818
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,320
And which is so funny, because tonight, like, everybody's been PMing me, like, I wanna play,

819
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,640
I wanna play, because I want the code.

820
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,600
But no, no, we said a couple weeks ago it was gonna be Toshin versus Footy, but we originally

821
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,300
said we were gonna play the match game, but I hate to break it to you guys, we thought

822
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,660
of something new.

823
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,360
So we're gonna subject you to a new game tonight, because we can do that, it's our show.

824
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,760
I am very scared about this.

825
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
You should be.

826
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Are you scared, Toshin?

827
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Yes.

828
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Alright.

829
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,600
Well, let's unveil the game that Toshin and Footy will be playing tonight for the Res

830
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,480
HD code.

831
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,560
That's right.

832
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,480
It's the OLR Family Feud will be what Toshin and Footy are playing tonight.

833
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,320
Alright, here's the deal.

834
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,480
We have surveyed several OLR personalities in different video gaming categories, the

835
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,120
OLR family, if you will, and you two will be competing against each other head to head

836
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,560
to see who can earn more points.

837
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,680
Here's how you earn more points.

838
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,900
You're gonna pick a number one through four that will be the board that you play when

839
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,360
it's your turn.

840
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,160
And on the board are the top answers in a particular video gaming category, like let's

841
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,480
say best game ever.

842
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,160
And you can take turns at the board to see what the hosts and our friends would have

843
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,640
said was the best game ever.

844
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,440
If you don't guess correctly, you guess something that's not on the board, you get a strike.

845
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,160
Three strikes, and it will go to the other player who will get one chance to steal the

846
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,800
board and all of your points.

847
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,200
So you definitely don't want to have your board stolen.

848
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,280
So it sounds good.

849
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,600
Are you familiar with the show Toshin?

850
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Yes I am.

851
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,160
Alright, are you familiar with the show, Footy?

852
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,200
I have no idea what you just said.

853
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Alright.

854
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Well then you're in trouble my friend.

855
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,080
Alright, well here's the thing.

856
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,180
We'll have Toshin go first then.

857
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,080
So that way, Footy, hopefully you can figure out what's going on quickly, alright?

858
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,000
Okay, basically it comes down to what?

859
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,600
I have to say a name of a person that would have said what is the best game to them.

860
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Not a person, not a person.

861
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,920
Let's say the category was best video game ever made.

862
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,120
Like since you know that I answered it, you would probably guess that Super Metroid is

863
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,280
somewhere on the board.

864
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,520
And then you'd hear ding.

865
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,200
But if you guessed, you know, a game that none of us, like if you guessed Crysis, then

866
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,600
you'd hear ehhh, because none of us would have picked that, you know, because we're

867
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
not Sakura Max.

868
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
So, okay.

869
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,080
So you're going to be telling us whose names are on the board?

870
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
Yes.

871
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
And then I have to guess a name?

872
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Or, okay.

873
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Yes, I'm going to, no you don't have to guess a name, you just have to guess the answers

874
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
that are on the board.

875
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
This is getting complicated.

876
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Alright.

877
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Alright.

878
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
That's alright.

879
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Okay.

880
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Alright, here is the OLR family that have contributed to tonight's answers.

881
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,400
Myself, Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, Loki has contributed to the board tonight, Bobby Blackwolf

882
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,560
contributed to the board tonight, Miklatov contributed to the board tonight, RicePrincess

883
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,200
and DMN all have contributed answers to the board.

884
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,480
So there are seven possible answers, but sometimes answers are worth more because multiple people

885
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
said them.

886
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,000
Like, for instance, if it had been best game ever, Chrono Trigger probably would have been

887
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
worth like three points.

888
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So, does that make sense?

889
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah.

890
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Alright.

891
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Here we go.

892
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,560
Oh, we have to do it just like they do on the show.

893
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,360
Let's play The Feud.

894
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,100
I said, let's play The Feud.

895
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Where's the damn music?

896
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,160
There we go.

897
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Let's play the feud.

898
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Alright, alright.

899
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Stop music.

900
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Alright, here we go.

901
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,080

1016
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Chun Li up there

1017
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:54,500
Is my soundboard gonna work? No, it's Chun Li up there

1018
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,780
No

1019
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,540
Damn board. All right, so ding ding ding toshin gets the three points. It's now three to four

1020
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,140
Kind of three point three points Canada four points, Argentina

1021
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,220
What's that as the sound man behind the scenes here?

1022
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,640
If you're picking a different sample, you can double click on if it's the same sample. You have to hit play

1023
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,120
All right. Thank you. Now. I know this is just some random guys

1024
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920

Love you. All right one board left with your name on it. It's short

best Atari

1037
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
2600 game ever

1038
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,200
Top seven answers are on the board. Everyone said something different

1039
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,040
Okay, um pitfall

1040
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,440
Pitfall show me pitfall

1041
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,360
Strike good guess though

1042
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,260
What the hell wasn't the entire 2600 anyways

1043
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,780
I can't remember for the love of me. Um

1044
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,660
Pac-man

1045
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,400
Pac-man the abortion of a game on the Atari 2600. It's tough. I'm just kidding that we made fun of her

1046
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
I don't know

1047
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,860
All right, show me Pac-man

1048
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,700
That was a no, all right

1049
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:02,180
All right, why are you laughing it's not like he said et. All right, I

1050
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Almost said it's either

1051
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:12,380
Buddy, you're awesome. You know, we think you're awesome in tow and Toshi too. All right, buddy. Come on. You got to get a point

1052
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,540
Here you go two strikes best Atari 2600 game ever

1053
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:23,620
You know what I'm gonna follow my fellow Spanish speaking person I'm gonna go with adventure

1054
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,060
adventure

1055
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:31,940
Show me adventure. Yes adventure is on the board. Bobby Blackwolf said adventure. There you go. You got a point

1056
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,020
All right

1057
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,980
And you still have two strikes try to get some more points buddy. Okay, um

1058
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:44,420
So I have what six more people it's at six for a game six more people six more answers

1059
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:50,980
Oh my god, she can remember my my attorneys hundred games. Um, I

1060
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:58,940
Get some clues. Oh, yes, they are. Here's your clue. They are Atari 2600 games

1061
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,260
God if I remember the games

1062
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,740
You know what I can't remember name games for the church is hundred

1063
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,180
I'm gonna say

1064
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,180
Galaga, I don't I don't even know if that wasn't

1065
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,060
Alright, at least we got an answer out of you. Jeez. We had to beat it out of you. All right, here it is

1066
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,780
Show me Galaga

1067
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,260
I'm sorry

1068
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:31,500
I don't think Galaga was on it, but that's all right. Good guess. All right toshin here. Here it is

1069
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,140
It's your chance to steal

1070
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,480
Let me let me tell you what the odd what the what the stakes are here

1071
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,320
If you steal the board you will win but if you don't steal the board footy will win

1072
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:48,000
That's what it comes down to right here. So, uh toshin you thought any thought what would you say is the best Atari 2600 game?

1073
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,840
Have our man. I already know the answer. I should have given

1074
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,720
Is your name toshin? All right

1075
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,560
Tell just remember of a game toshin. What's it gonna be?

1076
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,280
I'm not even looking at the chat room. So if anybody's actually trying to spam me answers like they were five minutes ago

1077
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,320
It's not happening. So I'm telling you guys right now

1078
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,560
All right, I have either two guesses here, but it's either do I want to be creative or do I want to be popular?

1079
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,600
Let me get in if I go with the answer. You got to go for what she thinks on the board

1080
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,320
exactly and

1081
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
They're all 2600 games

1082
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,920
See okay, I'm just gonna go with

1083
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:34,640
Asteroids for the game show me asteroids

1084
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,680
What was the other one you were thinking of crazy climber crazy climber crazy climber also would have been a big

1085
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:56,920
All right, no crazy climber was on the Atari 2600 I think all right, I just thought of joust for some reason

1086
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,800
Let me run down. Let me run down the top answers. You're gonna hate me for this one. Rob said pitfall to

1087
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,800
Is oh man, come on. That's all

1088
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,320
Play the games. They're big difference. All right, Jamie said kangaroo

1089
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,960
Loki said combat

1090
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Shane said spider-man

1091
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,360
Irene said missile command and

1092
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,840
DM n said warlords were the answers that were left on the board. So there you have it

1093
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,240
Argentina and footy monster wins five to three

1094
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,540
But you know what since you guys subjected yourself to that game. You know what we're gonna give

1095
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,560
Courtesy of olr. We're giving you both res HD. How's that sound?

1096
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,680
We're gonna give it to both you guys. So here's how to work. I'm act deft has the code so act deft

1097
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,120
I'm gonna have you send that code over to footy cuz he'll get his right away for actually winning and

1098
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,080
Toshin, you'll get yours later. You're actually probably gonna give you just Microsoft point so you can buy it. Okay?

1099
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,120
What

1100
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,080
I want as much as anybody else right now. Well, you want it anyway

1101
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,280
You just got to wait a little while four to six weeks for shipping and handling. All right

1102
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,200
That was fun. Actually, I had that was a fun game. Did you like the game?

1103
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,440
I didn't know what I was eating. I did actually like to want to see a chat chat room. Did you guys like the game?

1104
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,880
Should we do it again in the future? I want to see you in the chat

1105
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,640
All right

1106
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,800
so well

1107
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:24,220
Thank you guys very much for playing and subjecting yourself to the olr family feud featuring the crappy soundboard

1108
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
All right

1109
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,760
All right guys, we're gonna hang up on you and have a good night, okay

1110
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,200
Okay, you guys all right, but by and footy, let me know if act deaf doesn't get you the code because I have it somewhere

1111
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,200
But I'm sure he'll send it to you. Okay

1112
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,440
You just send me a message asking for my email. So I'm guessing we're in the works. Wonderful

1113
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,360
All right, have a good one. All right toshin. I'll be in touch with you. All right. Bye. Bye

1114
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,400
Yeah

1115
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,560
All right. No, so did you guys like the game? It went on for like 20 minutes, but it was cool

1116
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,960
It's sort of fun a little different. All right

1117
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
Let's see. I

1118
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,920
I like the concept but it's a horrible game. You can't you can't get anyone's answers

1119
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
The group is being the group being surveyed is way too difficult to predict

1120
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,200
It's funny to hear their answers, but near impossible to get guess them

1121
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,280
Hmm like that's any better than like the match game. We'll see. Well, yeah, I know

1122
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,160
Well, we'll try it. We'll try a version. Maybe we'll survey the entire chat room before the show

1123
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,400
We'll see but then but then the chatters know what's coming. That's the problem

1124
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,500
That's why we didn't do it that way this time because then they know what questions are coming now

1125
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,440
I just see you so this is fine the way it was. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see they can quit their bitching. All right

1126
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,460
All right, well, uh, we'll see what happens with that in the future in the meantime

1127
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,280
We've got to go back to some more news

1128
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,400
We got more gaming news just a little bit and then we're gonna open the skype line

1129
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,440
For you guys to give us a call with your own thoughts on fire. Yes, and then we'll set the skype line on fire

1130
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:57,680
Go. All right any excuse for me to play the pac-man noise again. We will be welcomed. All right, next story, please ninja guide in to

1131
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,520
If you pre-order it you get stuff

1132
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,920
the end

1133
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,040
What kind of stuff the first 39,000 people to?

1134
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,120
pre-order their copy and pick it up from a

1135
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,960
selected retailers

1136
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Are going to get a set of armor in the game that?

1137
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,400
Let's you look like the bad guys that you're facing it's a

1138
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,840
basically a nice big costume for you, so

1139
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:32,660
However, if you are of the more patient variety, you can download a costume pack of three

1140
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,080
in

1141
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,280
July which will be 200 Microsoft points

1142
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,600
It's going to have Ninja guidance who will be out in Europe on the 6th of June

1143
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,920
So you can test out how fun it is then

1144
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,640
All right

1145
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,060
Yay, yay indeed stuff

1146
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,120
All right. I like stuff

1147
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,480
I just don't like having to pre-order games because then a better deal will come out of the game the day the game comes out

1148
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,640
Yeah

1149
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,640
Well, there's gonna be hopefully some interesting news coming very soon

1150
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,400
apparently

1151
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:12,800
Microsoft is having a PR event next week where they're going to

1152
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:21,280
Supposedly debut the new Xbox 360 motion controller, and of course we talked about last week their partnership with gyration

1153
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,360
Also the other things that they're going to be unveiling and I know this is probably going to happen is banjo-kazooie 3

1154
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,160
In fact there's been some screenshots. I've already come out for that so

1155
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:40,480
It's going to be interesting to see what goes on, and this is during the game critics awards, I guess

1156
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,760
That's supposed to happen next week, so I

1157
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,120
Don't know we'll see all right. You know what actually um a good idea came to us

1158
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,640
I'm going to get can I read this aloud for the family Feud. I I guess so sure

1159
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:02,440
I think this is a good idea is that we could survey the chat room for family Feud and have people in studio play like

1160
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,420
When we have some of our guests here like we could get like rice princess and mo to battle each other we could get

1161
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,300
Nathan and next offer or something like get some guests on the show to battle each other that might be kind of fun

1162
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,040
That might be a little bit access to the chat room exactly that that then it would be a secret

1163
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:25,160
I like that idea we have to make them face like us. We'll see a panel in this chat room feud at that point

1164
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,940
Maybe that's what we'll rename it to the chat room feud all right anyhow. Sorry

1165
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:34,120
I didn't mean to derail from the topic of the games. Yes, you did. Yeah, I did a little bit, but I mean

1166
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,600
How much of a we ripoff is this going to be if at all or do you think they are going a totally different?

1167
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,920
Direction with this if true it depends what they do with it

1168
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,400
I think if they're if it's going to be like the other Q motion stuff

1169
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,680
Which is essentially you buy like something that looks like a bowling ball something looks like a you know

1170
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:56,520
Golf club and something like that. I don't know how popular that's gonna be it'll be nifty

1171
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,320
but it's not gonna be something that I think you'd have to go run out right away and buy and

1172
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,180
Also, I would I would like to see them to come up with something a little bit more universal

1173
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:11,080
So you're not buying this huge peripheral for one game because I'm kind of retarded

1174
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,560
but I don't know we'll have to see what they come up with I think it's gonna be hard for them not to

1175
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,400
be kind of

1176
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,560
Accused of ripping off Nintendo, so

1177
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,760
Because even Sony was accused of ripping off Nintendo when that six axis was thrown in at the last minute

1178
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Remember that that and that was wasn't even really the same thing. You know what I mean, but still though

1179
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,540
It's just like oh, and now it has motion sensitive stuff and and really

1180
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,880
Would that pan out to I mean hardly any games use it. So I

1181
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,080
don't

1182
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,000
All right

1183
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,100
Anyhow, we got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're gonna be getting to the skype line here very shortly

1184
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,760
But this next story requires some music

1185
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:04,040
And you know what that means somebody earned themselves a stupid award this week in some horrific

1186
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,520
Amount of violence and the person who wins the stupid award on olr this week is Edward Stoddard

1187
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,340
Congratulations. He was arrested in Dade City and you know what he did

1188
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:21,100
He murdered his neighbor over a missing PlayStation 3. That's right

1189
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:28,220
He murdered Douglas Abrams because they were arguing over the PlayStation 3 on April 24th

1190
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:35,940
No really word on what it was that they were specifically arguing about but it just kind of begs the question is a PlayStation 3

1191
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,340
really worth killing someone over

1192
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,260
That's what I would have been playing grand thought of for on said PlayStation 3

1193
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,380
But it just goes to show you know

1194
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:51,980
Regardless, you know, obviously this guy obviously has issues. He needs to he needs to play Wii ethics

1195
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,620
Is it appropriate to kill someone over a missing video game console? Yes or no?

1196
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:02,140
And if you say yes, then the console spits acid at you or something, I don't know. But wait, that's that's not good

1197
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,140
That's awesome. All right

1198
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,260
Whoa wrong answer die you need to be rinsing acid

1199
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,260
But

1200
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,820
What

1201
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,660
Instead of it being like, you know, highly corrosive acid

1202
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:20,500
It should be like minor lee corrosive acid so that they're left with chemical burns and you all know that they scored wrong

1203
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:24,100
You I think that would be great. You've got issues

1204
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:31,180
No, because it wouldn't kill them. It just maimed them a little and everyone would know that they're stupid. All right

1205
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:37,500
Anyway, stupid award stories usually make me a little bit angsty and also the fact that I forgot to put it anywhere else

1206
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,500
Yeah

1207
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,620
That's right, I caught it I can't save myself. Yeah CF use of the week

1208
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:05,940
My fu of the week now, I told Rob what it was on Friday, but I've decided to expand it a little bit and

1209
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,940
my

1210
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:14,260
My fu of the week is to people who buy into what they're told without

1211
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:22,380
Researching it first and my primary example was the practice of circumcising little boys. Ow

1212
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,860
crossing legs

1213
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,860
because I

1214
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,440
understand that for religious purposes as part of your culture, but

1215
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:37,160
For purpose of aesthetics or thinking that it's healthy. No, it's not and actually it

1216
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:43,560
Ends up being very traumatic and also makes them getting the nookie a lot less satisfying

1217
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,800
this

1218
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:51,920
so also in the same tone then it goes to people who think that

1219
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,400
just because

1220
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,320
Specialist a has said oh this is you know

1221
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:06,080
Not what you want to do this suddenly it's law and I'm not gonna go into specifics on that in particular

1222
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
but there's

1223
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,680
Okay, actually I'm gonna sort of go into specifics on this one

1224
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:18,640
That's right that there being some sort of widespread rumor that if you were a massage therapist

1225
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:26,080
And you were suddenly in adult entertainment and this way I get really pissed off at the whole happy ending bullshit because

1226
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
because of people who

1227
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,280
Think that and those jokes that go around. I haven't been able to get my business license for six months

1228
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,040
So don't I'm very very very angry about that, but they've revamped

1229
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:48,520
The requirements for it in my uh in my town and made it up to where I can, you know, get my license again

1230
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,280
It's also goes towards people who you know

1231
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,560
It's really just a bunch of what we think a bunch of what?

1232
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,440
we accept as fact in our daily lives is really in

1233
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:10,560
In most cases the result of sensationalism and people trying to tell us what they want us to think so that we'll spend money in said

1234
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,640
Area so that more money will go into the pockets of people who?

1235
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,200
You know are lying to us basically

1236
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:24,340
So I say research everything yourself before you believe what you see on TV or what you hear from from people

1237
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,160
That's a lot to say

1238
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:33,640
All right, I think for yourself reject false icons. Yes reject false icons Loki after you driving to and from Oakland

1239
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,200
If I can hate that drive

1240
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:42,400
It's long and boring and it's Oakland. It's Oakland. Um, my heavy. Is that it? Hey, yeah, it's a long drive

1241
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
You're like, oh, yeah, Oakland

1242
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,380
There's a yummy Indian food place in Oakland eight Ellen

1243
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,560
Speaking of food at you to the news

1244
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,720
I got this week that due to my pancreatus I had back in April when I was in the hospital for a few days

1245
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:03,000
If you did the fact that I will be stuck on a low-fat diet for two more months, which means no Indian food

1246
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,560
Well, I guess there's some Indian food dishes I can have but no garlic naan or the stuff

1247
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:12,020
I really like for two more months at least and the fact that that means I can't have cake or ice cream on my 30th

1248
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,500
Birthday that kind of blows but at least I'd rather be eating low-fat than be dead

1249
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,420
So if you did that and if you did the fact that on top of you know dealing with all that

1250
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:26,120
I think I'm getting a cold or something. So F you to being sick twice at the same time. It kind of sucks. I

1251
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Just want this year to go away

1252
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,360
The show has been good though. That's one good thing about it. The show's been great

1253
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,560
All right

1254
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,520
Hippolytus and chat asks, dude, how much weight has sky lost? 25 pounds. I lost 25 pounds

1255
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,720
I used to have quite a bit of a little bit of a beer gut now

1256
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,440
I have a tiny little beer gut and

1257
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,280
I'm gonna be starting to work out soon because I'm starting to feel a lot better like my chest and everything

1258
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:54,560
So it's gonna be I'm gonna have abs by the time all is said and done. We'll see at least that's the goal

1259
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,680
All right

1260
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:05,220
Let's move on to the skype line we're gonna be taking some calls on the skype line

1261
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,680
You can call us at 1 8 7 7 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio

1262
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,140
We don't have time for a lot of calls tonight, but we'll definitely try to get some calls

1263
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,700
In so you can call us right now while we wait for some calls

1264
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:26,220
Do you have a quick last-minute story for us Matt? Yeah prototypes been delayed to 2009. What's prototype is this game?

1265
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:31,340
It's like crackdown, but you're like a mutant you crazy shit jump around big sandbox game

1266
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,580
Interesting come out this fall

1267
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,980
2009 now

1268
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:41,020
Well, that's too bad. Yeah, anything else? Uh kill zone 2 is officially announced for February 2009

1269
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,820
So that's pretty awesome. I think resistance still coming out this fall

1270
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:48,860
So and then we have that to look forward to but kill zone 2 pretty cool

1271
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:53,880
There was some footage online for that, but apparently got yanked because it wasn't supposed to be out yet. Oh

1272
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:58,380
Well, that sucks. Let's go to Z phones

1273
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,460
Hello, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this? Oh

1274
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:08,680
My god, it's clicky the pen clicky who gave you access to a telephone

1275
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,680
I

1276
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,800
I'm sorry sky he he must have butt-dialed you guys or something. I don't know. I was crying

1277
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:23,480
It's what it's Bobby was clicky trying to flirt with the ferret. I think that's what it was. I think he's demanding ransom

1278
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:29,440
I think he knows where the ferret is. I think clicky kidnapped the ferret for money. That's that's amazing

1279
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,160
What's on your mind Bobby to what do we owe this call tonight?

1280
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,080
Or was it just clicky trying to get through it was clicky trying to get through but hi, but now that you're here

1281
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,000
Oh any anything in news? This is a very busy week for news. I

1282
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:46,920
Know you talked to it's always funny because you know you do the show that's on right before us on all games calm at five

1283
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,600
o'clock Pacific and you were talking about the whole DRM digital rights management thing, which I

1284
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,840
Read about earlier this week and I was like I want to talk about it this week on orange launch radio

1285
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,960
And then it didn't even make it in our show role because I forgot

1286
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,840
All right

1287
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:08,720
Well low key get some up what happened real quick because I want to get Bobby's opinion on this and our other opinions

1288
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:14,240
Originally EA came up with this wonderful idea that both Mass Effect and spore. We're gonna need to be

1289
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:20,040
Validated via I guess an online call home thing every 10 days

1290
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:24,120
And if it didn't do that it wouldn't work anymore, so

1291
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,800
That sucked, but then they came out and decided hey

1292
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,160
We're not gonna do that because people don't like that kind of thing so now Mass Effect's only it's gonna

1293
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,840
Authenticate itself when you first install it and then if you download any additional download content

1294
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:46,600
It'll redo that as well same as spore spore once you install it and also if you connect to online

1295
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,040
So a Bobby what are your thoughts on this?

1296
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,240
I don't want to spoil your whole show because I know you you go into it on your show

1297
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,320
But what quickly what were kind of your thoughts on this issue?

1298
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:02,600
Well my thing was more because you know they're trying to market spore because will right is was on the Colbert report

1299
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,720
He's been doing the late-night talk show rounds

1300
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:11,560
They're trying to market spore to a larger audience than just gamers and not every person who has a computer

1301
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,800
actually has

1302
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:19,480
Internet access from their home either they use it for work, or they go to a public library or something you know

1303
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,000
They may have a decent computer, but it may not necessarily be online

1304
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,160
And so you know even that one-time activation may be a problem for some people because they're used to just getting this DVD

1305
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:35,080
Or CD and sticking in their computer and playing and now you can't do that now you have to have this other charge

1306
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,240
You have to have internet service from your home

1307
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,940
Just to play it and the reason that they got rid of the 10-day

1308
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,000
Phoning home every 10 days was actually because of the US Armed Forces

1309
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,400
They can't guarantee an internet connection when they're overseas, but they still play games on their PC

1310
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:54,400
They do have downtime to get their mind off of what they're doing right, and I think that's why they got rid of the 10-day

1311
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,000
Restriction, but there's still that first time and then any other time when you're online

1312
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,560
Then it will check, but it's not going to force you

1313
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,360
But I think it still leaves out a segment of the population that doesn't have internet at home

1314
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,120
Why would think especially in the case of the Armed Forces who are doing you know a big job?

1315
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,560
That not a lot of people want to do for this country

1316
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,720
I would hope that EA

1317
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:18,200
Would come up with a way that they can bypass it at least the Armed Forces can get a special version of the game or

1318
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:23,920
Something now granted you know there's a special version of the game that the Armed Forces got it would be on the internet that yeah

1319
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,380
I guess that's the unfortunate side of that is that would happen, but somehow like I don't know

1320
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,800
There's got to be something that even they do even with this. I think it's gonna be broken

1321
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,880
It doesn't matter everybody finds a way to get past everything. That's true. It wasn't didn't Bioshock do something similar

1322
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,840
Yeah, but people found ways around that yeah

1323
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,640
And people like you would only let you install it on so many computers

1324
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,040
And it had to connect to the internet each time and then once it hit its limit too bad so sad. I guess yeah

1325
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,800
Yeah, something like that

1326
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,240
Frisbee points out in chat room the portal retail version requires online to start up which

1327
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,660
Well, I don't know because I bought it on steam and steam does all that copy protection stuff

1328
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:05,600
You know kind of as part of I think you have to have steam when you buy the retail version. Oh, oh, that's right

1329
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,600
That's right. I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago. Not that I know or anything, but they found a way around that

1330
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,600
You you heard I heard yeah, okay?

1331
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:23,240
Is that from your independent research that you did it's from I own I own the orange box on you know Xbox 360

1332
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,240
I just want to see would look like I'm a PC

1333
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,960
All right Bobby anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight

1334
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:37,400
No, that's that that was it. It was I blame eight wait a minute click clicky. Don't come back. Don't talk about the ferret clicky

1335
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:44,600
Click that's not nice clicky. Yeah. Yeah, I know they've got an explicit tag clicky, but go away. Sorry about that Rob

1336
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:50,440
No, that's that's quite. Okay. You know I'm thinking maybe click clicky in the ferret could get their own show that no one would listen

1337
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,440
to no one

1338
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,040
Except maybe Jamie

1339
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:02,680
She's making pouty face at me all right bye Bobby bye clicky bye Rob go away click

1340
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,920
All right, black boy in chat says I would totally listen to that show so there you have it

1341
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,800
What exactly would clicky in the ferret talk about what do pens and ferrets have in common? I'm not sure

1342
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,120
They're long. That's true as go to the phones. We have more calls. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1343
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:27,480
Hi, this is a deaf hello act-deaf. Hey good submission good effort in the challenge tonight

1344
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,800
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you, but you know I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that

1345
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:37,480
But it's tough. I asked this to 100 Matt kind of he did something similar to what you did

1346
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,720
I think that might have been part of the problem, and he just I think he does radio stuff

1347
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:47,160
So we had a slight advantage, but good for him. Yeah. Yeah, he did a way better job than me

1348
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,960
But we still I hope that he can win

1349
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,680
We still appreciate the effort and are feeling the love very much to what do we owe this call tonight act-deaf

1350
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:02,840
Well basically I was going to congratulate Matt for winning and

1351
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,680
Like I said, I hope that he gets all our

1352
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,560
How do you say it?

1353
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,560
support for him to win the old games calm a contest overall I

1354
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Though I hope he

1355
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,600
he gives a

1356
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,760
The console to Loki because I was going to do that if I won all you act-deaf was serious

1357
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,000
He was going to give you the console if you want

1358
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,640
And I would not have let him do that because that's a foolish thing to do I would have made him keep it

1359
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,360
Not a foolish thing to do I would have been watching your mailbox when I see this big box

1360
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,040
I mean from Mexico. I would have written died

1361
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,640
Expired

1362
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,680
That doesn't work by the way

1363
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,520
Have you tried doing that to just try that with junk mail?

1364
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,520
Deceased no, they don't believe it if I know hey, well someone was there to write deceased on it

1365
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:04,920
So therefore the more junk is that all you want to say act-deaf day any anything going on in your gaming world this week?

1366
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,360
Basically much, it's pretty much that I haven't been gaming that much. I have been working and

1367
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:20,600
And other stuff, but I'm pretty looking forward to spacing by there's extreme. Oh, yes, man. I have I

1368
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,480
Have seen some of the videos and and oh my god. That's awesome. It's an awesome game

1369
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,720
I think it reminds me of rest. I played it for about three minutes, and it was an awesome three minutes

1370
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:37,000
I definitely am gonna pick this game up on my PSP. It's it's it's got a great yes

1371
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,600
It is on the ds2 yeah, I think I'm gonna get on PSP

1372
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:46,080
Just just for the heck of it so and it's going to be pretty cheap. Also. It's not it's like $20 on GameStop

1373
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,880
Yeah, I think it's 20 bucks

1374
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,120
It's very it's cheap, and I think it'll be good

1375
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,400
I will review the game in full a little later on as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it

1376
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,680
So well act I was looking forward act F

1377
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,440
take a break from making radio ads this week and definitely play some more games if you can and

1378
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,480
We're gonna need your help so that we can get SSJ 100 Matt to win the contest at all games

1379
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,680
So as soon as I know how how he can do that. We'll fill you in

1380
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,720
Okay, all right. Thanks. All right. Take care, buddy

1381
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,200
If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game

1382
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:26,560
Olr our username on Skype is orange lounge radio meanwhile. Do we have any other last-minute stories? Oh wait

1383
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,440
No, just kidding. We have another call hi on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

1384
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,480
Hey, it's DJ tired. Hey DJ Tyron. How are you doing good?

1385
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,960
That was a fun Mario Kart match last night by the way. I don't remember most of it

1386
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,400
What why not do you not remember me kicking your ass? I was a little

1387
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:52,000
Drinky drinky you were drunk play Mario Kart online. Yeah, I just I just gotten home. I'm like what am I gonna do?

1388
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,160
I don't wanna go to sleep yet

1389
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,080
So I put popped in Mario Kart, and I was able to navigate the menu shoes perfectly fine

1390
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,040
But once I got in the game it was it was all downhill from there

1391
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,700
No, wonder you kept coming in last, and I was blaming it on the fact that you now

1392
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,020
Did you know that we actually were broadcasting that whole thing on Justin TV?

1393
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,240
Dude go to the Justin TV archives and look cuz the whole thing is broadcast

1394
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:17,340
I'm totally making fun of everybody using the wheel because I'm like look the people winning

1395
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,060
Using the wheel the people not winning. I mean the people winning not using we all the people not winning using the wheel

1396
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,860
So that is so funny

1397
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:25,320
I had no idea

1398
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,520
Do it and you had no idea because we were actually like I was on just TV doing something else that I'd promised the listeners

1399
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,920
last week. Somehow, in Justin TV chat, they were like, play Mario Kart, play Mario Kart.

1400
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,720
So I went in there, logged into Mario Kart, and it was like me, Rama, and then Dark Tetsuya,

1401
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,080
and then you joined out of nowhere. I was like, oh, Jimmy must have saw us on Justin

1402
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,800
TV. That is so funny. So you were drinking.

1403
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,040
Yeah. When you connect to Wi-Fi, if there's like one of your friends with an open room,

1404
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,400
it has like a smiley face next to friends. And I was like, will that be?

1405
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,300
I didn't know that. Okay, that's helpful. Wow, what a good case of timing, though. But

1406
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,440
shame on you for drinking and driving. I know. It was bad.

1407
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,200
But I guess if you're gonna do it, then you gotta do it in Mario Kart. I guess that's

1408
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,120
the safest place to drink and drive. Exactly.

1409
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,120
Nice. Awesome. Or GTA 4.

1410
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,360
Huh? Or GTA 4.

1411
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,320
So that's why you picked Rainbow Road, because I was like, oh god.

1412
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,520
No, I did random. I did not want to play Rainbow Road. I hate that level so much.

1413
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,880
Oh, okay. Okay. Alright. Because I was cursing you out when you picked it.

1414
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,360
I could tell. Everyone was hating me at that point, and if there was voice chat, it wouldn't

1415
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,200
have been very pretty. Yeah, maybe that's why Nintendo banned voice

1416
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:36,160
chat, so it spares us like a drunken Jim. Anything? Did you call in to talk about something

1417
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,200
else tonight, Jimmy? I totally derailed it to Mario Kart.

1418
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,680
No, no, that was it. Oh, okay. You were calling to make excuses

1419
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,360
for your drunken performance last night. Yep.

1420
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,360
Alright, that's fine. Alright, well, we'll have to play a sober match sometime. Maybe

1421
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,600
you can represent the OLR crew when we do our big epic battle with Bobby Black Wolf

1422
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,600
later. Okay.

1423
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,800
Alright. Take care, Jimmy. Hey, thanks for getting me on the show.

1424
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,120
No problem. Bye. Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype

1425
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,640
line tonight, because we went really long with the match game thing, and we want to

1426
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,920
try to end it at a decent hour tonight. So, Loki, please finish up any other last minute

1427
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:13,400
stories you might have tonight. Okay. Let's see here. Well, first off, let's

1428
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:19,240
talk real quick. We mentioned a lot of stuff about Rock Band earlier. Apparently, well,

1429
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,680
first off, they've got some new stuff coming out this week, of course. Hanging on Telephone

1430
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:27,600
by Blondie, Train in Vain by The Clash, and Cool Thing by Sonic Youth. So, that's pretty

1431
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,720
awesome. All going to be two bucks, or 160 Microsoft points.

1432
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:42,240
There's also some, I guess, tracks on sale. All sorts of stuff between, I guess, now and

1433
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:50,560
June 2nd. I guess two per week are going to be half price, or 80 Microsoft points. So,

1434
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:57,860
I guess, this week there was Crush Crush Crush by Paramore, and Boston's Rock and Roll Band.

1435
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:04,560
I guess, later this week, there was Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia, and Faith No More's

1436
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:12,280
We Care A Lot, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's Gimme Three Steps. And then, I'm not sure what's

1437
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:20,800
coming up later. Let me see here real quick. Next week, there's going to be Shockwave,

1438
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:27,080
Black Tide, and Sugar Magnolia by Grateful Dead. And then, the week after that, We Care

1439
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:34,840
A Lot, I guess Faith No More, and All the Small Things by Blink-182. And then, finally,

1440
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,000
I guess, last week is going to be Gimme Three Steps by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Dirty Little

1441
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,460
Secret by All American Rejects. If you want more information, Major Nelson had a story

1442
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:53,080
on it, so you can check that out. Half price. And, Activision, during their conference call,

1443
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:58,440
there's going to be no new Tony Hawk game in 2008. However, they did say that there

1444
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,240
was, I guess, kind of contradicting themselves a little bit, a new Tony Hawk game exclusive

1445
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:11,120
to the DS this year, that's going to utilize new technology not seen on the DS. So, maybe

1446
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,200
another sort of plug-in or something for the Game Boy Advance slot, kind of similar to

1447
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:23,120
Guitar Hero on tour. I guess we'll have to see. This week, also, there's a ton of demos

1448
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:29,000
being released on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, Born Conspiracies on there, Haze

1449
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,200
on the PlayStation 3, Grid, which you got to check out, awesome racing game that's on

1450
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:40,760
both. And, next week, or actually, a few weeks from now, June 5th, there's going to be Battlefield

1451
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:47,200
Bad Company, in case you didn't get into the beta. New Xbox Live arcade game coming in

1452
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:53,340
June, Vigilante 8 Arcade, which, you know, Vigilante 8 was a fucking awesome game. It's

1453
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:58,040
also going to have download content. No word when in June it's coming, but at least I have

1454
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:06,720
a month nailed down. Gran Turismo shipped 50 million units total for the entire franchise,

1455
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:13,920
and that's globally, so that's pretty awesome. Let's see here. This sounds pretty cool. I

1456
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,800
didn't actually, well, I played a little bit of Namco X Capcom, or Cross Capcom, but now

1457
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,880
there's a new game coming out called Cross Edge, and it's got characters from Capcom,

1458
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Nippon Ichi, Namco Bandai, Gust, and Idea Factory. It's going to be an RPG, including

1459
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,200
characters from all sorts of different things. They have characters from Disgaea, Darkstalkers,

1460
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:49,400
Artolico, I guess, all sorts of stuff. This is coming from Famitsu magazine, which has

1461
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:57,240
some nifty screenshots for that. Looks like Morgan's in there, and Etna, and I'm not sure

1462
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:04,960
who else. Oh, Donovan, and looks like, who else. Lots of people though. Looks pretty

1463
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:10,160
awesome. I like AJ Mix's idea for a game in chat. Everyone cross everyone. I like that.

1464
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:14,760
Me too. Now this is kind of neat, and remember I think a few weeks ago when we were trying

1465
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:22,160
to show off Crisis Core, it really pissed me off, but thank God for the homebrew community.

1466
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:32,480
On the PSP, there is a new homebrew update called FUSA Build 032. What it does is allows

1467
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:38,240
people with custom firmwares to use the video out and use any sort of cord they want, so

1468
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:45,060
whether it be a composite, component, S-video, or D-terminal, they can use it on their TV,

1469
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:52,720
play games, and they have a whole bunch of other options for that. Something that should

1470
01:22:52,720 --> 01:23:00,960
have been done anyways in a firmware update, I think, but whatever. Let's see here. We've

1471
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:10,560
got one more thing here. This is kind of funny. There's a, I guess this gaming device called

1472
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:16,160
Bob that's being released, and what it is, is it's a way for parents, they would hook

1473
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:22,000
it up to a console of their choice, and they can set time limits for the amount of games

1474
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:29,000
that kids can play. So it kind of looks like a giant calculator, and it will shut the power

1475
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,040
off after a certain amount of time, and it's password protected. So it's kind of neat.

1476
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:42,600
And then finally, I have to show this to you, Rob. They're going to release this on cell

1477
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:48,500
phone games from Gameloft. They're remaking the Oregon Trail. Nice. And it's done all

1478
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:54,840
fancy-like, and I can totally see this coming to the DS at some point. Wow, it looks like

1479
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,120
Oregon Trail does battle. That's kind of weird looking. Yeah. Interesting. All fancy-like,

1480
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:05,240
but yeah, you can check it out. Hey look, as long as I can make a character named Jamie

1481
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:13,920
and she dies of cholera. Heart. But that is it. All right. Hey, at least it wasn't dysentery

1482
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:23,240
because dysentery is so cliche. All right. Anyhow. That is why I hope I catch malaria.

1483
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,360
And I don't know, Jamie, you should check this out on Kotaku. They have the ultimate

1484
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,420
in horse riding simulation. I just thought of Final Furlong when I saw it. It looks like

1485
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:36,720
an actual horse. Hump a horse, the game. Yeehaw. And the person's even dressed up. Like a jockey.

1486
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:41,200
Like a horse? No. Are they humping? A horse riding a horse. Oh my god, a horse riding

1487
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:47,520
a horse. But a horse is a horse. Of course, of course. All right. That's going to do it

1488
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,240
for- A horse riding horse? How can that be? That's going to do it for another week of

1489
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:55,920
Orange Lounge Radio, but first we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1490
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,920
Dark Soccer, your final thought? Reject false icons. But I have an addition to that now.

1491
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:10,880
Think with your brain, not the TV guide. My final thought is reject the common cold. Loki.

1492
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,640
Need to play more ranked. Granted, I thought of four multiplayer. Oh, and sorry for people

1493
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:22,100
that see me online around 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock Pacific time. Yeah, because we do

1494
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:30,200
our online inter-employee games, and I accidentally invited people sometimes to that, and I haven't

1495
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:36,960
kicked them. Sorry, Jason51. Anyways, that's what's going on there. All right. So 10 a.m.

1496
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,160
and 3 p.m. not good GTA times for Loki. Yeah, noon though. Sometimes we'll leave it open

1497
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:46,000
during noon. All right. All right, that's going to do it for another week of Orange

1498
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,240
Lounge Radio. My name is Rob Roberts. That's Dark Soccer. That's Loki, and we're out of
