5
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because it's time for Part B of our podcast, which goes out to the podcast feed, usually on Wednesdays, Thursdays if I'm having an especially

00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:42,169
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360 Elite

7
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,699
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be awesome.

[SPEAKER_06]: And I played for you guys entry from an ineligible listener in Part A, so if you haven't heard Part A yet, go back and listen.

9
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:22,383
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you listening live tonight on All Games Radio, you have about four hours left to get an entry in.

10
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:26,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what, there's not a lot of competition, so if you think you can come up with something creative pretty quick...

11
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:27,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it!

12
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:29,166
[SPEAKER_06]: You might win an Xbox 360 Elite.

13
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,167
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be pretty awesome.

14
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:33,790
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll let you know who is the finalist for Orange Lounge Radio next week.

15
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we'll know in like two, two and a half weeks who the ultimate winner is from AllGames.com.

16
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:41,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's walking away with the 1-8 Xbox 360 Elite.

17
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:45,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget, just for being the Orange Lounge Radio finalist, you do get some prizes.

18
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:53,483
[SPEAKER_06]: You get like a t-shirt and $25 gift certificate to the new All Games store that's up and running.

19
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:54,403
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

20
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

21
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:59,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just for being silly and recording it for our mutual enjoyment.

22
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news here on Part B of Orange Launch Radio.

23
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, take it away.

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,970
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see here.

25
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:17,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is kind of interesting because I know they haven't been doing too well for the longest time, but Atari is actually being bought up by Infogrames for $11 million.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:27,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And the announced, I guess, merger, they're going to buy the remaining stock of Atari, of course, for $11 million, and that will immediately lend...

27
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:54,649
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 million dollars to the company before the deal closes and although it's hard to really say what's going to happen although Infogrames only had 51.4 controlling interest in Atari 51.4% looks like doesn't really sound like what kind of changes are going to happen after this but I guess it's nice for Atari to have a little bit more financial backing

28
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:57,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing, though.

29
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:00,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, Atari's been sold for $11 million.

30
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what I'm to understand?

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:01,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, $11 million is not that much money.

33
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

34
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:06,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd gladly take it.

35
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:06,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

36
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:09,466
[SPEAKER_04]: A bar company that I work for could have bought Atari.

37
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

38
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:14,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude, this is the company that is like my childhood.

39
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like little childhood, like when I was like three, was when the Atari 2600 was big, but still...

40
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird to think that... Why hasn't EA bought them?

41
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:27,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, it's just like, poof, snapped them up like nothing.

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:36,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know that they may not be interested in per se them, but a bigger portfolio is not a bad thing.

43
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:45,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, it sounds like there's some other stuff involved here, like they're loaning them $20 million and stuff, so maybe it's not fair to say they're only getting sold for $11 million, but still, that's kind of what it comes off as.

44
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of weird.

45
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be like if someone sold Nintendo 20 years from now for like, I don't know, $15, $20.

46
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:54,378
[SPEAKER_06]: A bag of peanuts.

47
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:56,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be like, it would be weird.

48
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it was also weird to see the Sega logo on a Nintendo game like years ago when F-Zero came out.

49
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,224
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all weird.

50
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:06,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It is weird.

51
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,482
[SPEAKER_06]: and Sephiroth1215 in our chat room.

52
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:12,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com says, Too bad most Atari or Infogrames games suck.

53
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:17,248
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dragon Ball Z games are good, but I'm really sick of them now because they just do the same thing every year.

54
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess that is the sad thing.

55
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:21,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari honestly hasn't had a lot going for it recently.

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,451
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that would have been perfect.

57
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have had Dragon Ball Z 2008 or 2009 for EA.

58
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:30,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I have to admit, I did kind of want one of those flashback consoles.

59
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not like I can't still get one, but you know, flashback consoles are cool.

60
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess there you have it.

61
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:44,975
[SPEAKER_06]: More to develop on that, or more news on that, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, including what the joint projects will be in the future.

62
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about QMotions.

63
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:50,420
[SPEAKER_06]: They are a subsidiary of Actiga.

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,001
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a gaming company.

65
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,124
[SPEAKER_06]: They apparently have made some sort of agreement with Microsoft.

66
00:04:55,444 --> 00:05:02,751
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be using the wireless technology that QMotions has for types of active gaming controllers for the Xbox 360.

67
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:10,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Q-Motions has made these large controllers for golf, baseball, and snowboarding.

68
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:13,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I've seen this before.

69
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:17,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say one of those times They sell them at Best Buy, I think.

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say one of those times we were on All Games Interactive last year or a couple years ago.

71
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:26,965
[SPEAKER_06]: They had one of these in the house.

72
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,986
[SPEAKER_06]: They just acquired one there.

73
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:30,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was the same thing.

74
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So they know how to make these types of controllers.

75
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently Microsoft is getting in on this now for who knows what type of project.

76
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:43,404
[SPEAKER_06]: But it kind of makes sense, you know, with the Wii doing as well as it is, Microsoft wants a piece of it somehow.

77
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:44,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll buy somebody else to do it.

78
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:46,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Make an agreement to do it.

79
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:53,151
[SPEAKER_06]: The press release stated that the first controller that will be coming out will be a big air wireless controller.

80
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:57,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a full-size skateboard that will work with skateboarding games.

81
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is pretty high-end stuff.

82
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:04,497
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't something that, you know, a gamer that doesn't have a lot of money can pick up.

83
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:08,399
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, I mean, if you really want to get immersed in your games, I guess this is the way to do it.

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,201
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what they should be setting up at the Westin.

85
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:14,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is the kind of thing you don't get to play every day.

86
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,119
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

87
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:16,880
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Loki?

88
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the type of thing you would be interested in at all?

89
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:19,741
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

90
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:20,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

91
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:21,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

92
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:26,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like, as Alton Brown would put it, it's a uni-tasker.

93
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one likes a uni-tasker.

94
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:29,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

95
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:30,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd.

96
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Only you would quote the Food Network here on our program.

97
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

98
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX LIVE XBOX LIVE

99
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:03,419
[SPEAKER_04]: for 1,600 Microsoft points, also $20.

100
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:08,723
[SPEAKER_04]: It will also make it the most expensive Xbox Live Arcade game to date.

101
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:13,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but if you add up all the parts in Luminous, it's a little more expensive.

102
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:19,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true, but still though, out of the gate though, this is the most expensive Xbox Live Arcade game.

103
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:23,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably going to set a disturbing trend among games.

104
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, they're going to buy it for $20.

105
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put out our crappy game for $20.

106
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:27,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

107
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:32,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but you kind of sense that Penny Arcade's going to be able to get away with it.

108
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's all about if the game is good, but at least the IP is good.

109
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:43,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, if it's a full game, I mean, they'll be awesome, but I just have a bad feeling, though, that other companies are going to look at this and go, hey, you know what?

110
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:47,051
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get our game to be $20, too, and they'll sell it and it'll be shit.

111
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:52,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if some little internet comic can get $20 for their game, then we ought to be able to sell our game for $20.

112
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You do that too well, Rob.

113
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:59,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been snooping in on boardrooms.

114
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,151
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Macintosh?

115
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

116
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:06,332
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room's asking.

117
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:09,714
[SPEAKER_06]: No love, I guess.

118
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:12,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we know anything about the actual game?

119
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: There's screenshots and stuff out there.

120
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done a lot of research on the game.

121
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It is gone gold for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

122
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:22,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you have it.

123
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:23,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

124
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't say you don't have anything to play on the Mac.

125
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:28,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know a lot about this game.

126
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it kind of like a

127
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:32,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Adventure type game?

128
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an adventure game.

129
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:38,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of think of a cross between one of the LucasArts adventure games and Final Fantasy.

130
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:43,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got the turn-based fighting in there as well.

131
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the Penny Arcade humor.

132
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:46,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

133
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks really cool.

134
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rock Band has made some progress, a lot of progress.

135
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:57,955
[SPEAKER_06]: This game, of course, just on about every console out there, except the Wii right now.

136
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:01,836
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, right?

137
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they have a version of this on PS2?

138
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's out there everywhere.

139
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,240
[SPEAKER_06]: They've announced that they have sold 3 million copies of the game.

140
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,021
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 million rock band songs have been downloaded.

141
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,802
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 million of those since March 20th, just about 6 weeks ago.

142
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:19,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

143
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:21,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, 3 million copies of the game, 10 million.

144
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:25,485
[SPEAKER_06]: That means on the average, people are buying 3 or 4 songs a pop.

145
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And how much do each song cost?

146
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:31,947
[SPEAKER_06]: About 2 bucks, depending on what platform and what song.

147
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So on average about... I'm wondering if they're counting those albums as 12 songs sold though, but I guess they can because they charge more for those.

148
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,432
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people really bought that album?

149
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:43,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's plenty.

150
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.

151
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:45,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not bashing the artists.

152
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a lot of songs on there.

153
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought quite a few too, I gotta admit.

154
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I buy them.

155
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:53,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't either, but it's the ultimate party game because you're glad to have them when people are over.

156
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:55,445
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are so funny.

157
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I buy them, but I bought them.

158
00:09:58,106 --> 00:10:00,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I have those Microsoft points burning a hole in my pocket.

159
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, that's why that stuff is evil.

160
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:07,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Microsoft, it's so easy to just press that one little button and spend Microsoft points.

161
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:10,149
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need to reload, just add more points.

162
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:10,850
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dangerous.

163
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,130
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you're not spending money, you're just spending points.

164
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

165
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't notice it until I look at my bank statement.

166
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:19,992
[SPEAKER_06]: and I go, son of a bitch, I just bought like 40 bucks worth of Microsoft points this month.

167
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:21,632
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I have to speak for it?

168
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought Jairus.

169
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:26,373
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty smart, though, that they get the points.

170
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:26,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

171
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:27,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Scary.

172
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:28,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

173
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:29,693
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

174
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:30,714
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

175
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:32,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going off the tangent train, unfortunately.

176
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:33,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dear God.

177
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:34,174
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what's up?

178
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:38,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you know, because you know me, I'm looking up last minute stories and stuff.

179
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:39,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure.

180
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:44,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to mention this because it just, poof, they had a big little thing in the corner of the screen here.

181
00:10:45,615 --> 00:11:01,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, at Maker Faire 2008 today, MacGyver creator Lee David Zlotoff announced that he is making a big budget MacGyver movie.

182
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.

183
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:03,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

184
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they're bastardizing everything we love in the 80s.

185
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,789
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an A-Team movie coming out, too.

186
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't they make these movies when they were popular?

187
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand.

188
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,072
[SPEAKER_09]: When MacGyver was still on the air.

189
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the whole retro thing.

190
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like a few years ago, 70s retro.

191
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:18,974
[SPEAKER_06]: They remade Charlie's Angels.

192
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:20,135
[SPEAKER_06]: They remade the Brady Bunch.

193
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:21,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the 80s are coming.

194
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:24,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's just a matter of time before we get the Facts of Life movie.

195
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:26,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would they cast as Natalie and Tootie?

196
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

197
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:28,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Tootie.

198
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I just kind of think it's a no.

199
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:39,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumor is the movie will be made out of a shoelace, paper clips, and a jar of peanut butter.

200
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you take us back to video games, please?

201
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:41,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

202
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

203
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:49,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's some interesting news coming out with...

204
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero, Aerosmith

205
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,872
[SPEAKER_04]: A length of time, but I mean, God, who cares?

206
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:23,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning there's an escape clause in it should Guitar Hero tank in the near future so Aerosmith can get in on the other game.

207
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:24,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

208
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,180
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotta be that.

209
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, apparently, excluding, I guess, Rock Band's train kept on rolling, Aerosmith's entire catalog of rock and roll hits will be exclusive to Guitar Hero.

210
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:47,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says, Newsweek got confirmation that the Aerosmith publicist and Activision PR that the band's songs would be locked down for an unspecified period of time.

211
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is for a limited amount of time.

212
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning there's an escape clause, just in case.

213
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:52,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

214
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:53,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

215
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:54,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

216
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:55,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

217
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:11,095
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

218
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I don't know.

219
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:17,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a real problem with this kind of stuff because I see this as the beginning.

220
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:21,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the little pebble that starts the snowball that starts the avalanche.

221
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:30,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we all know, you know, we heard last week Guitar Hero 4 is supposedly following in rock bands' footsteps where they're going to be adding voice, they're going to be adding drums, possibly.

222
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:31,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of it's speculation.

223
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:35,307
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we know there's... But the thing is, we'll both play nice.

224
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:40,050
[SPEAKER_06]: or am I going to have to have two of everything like Noah's freaking Ark in my gaming closet?

225
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,912
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's up to Activision, if it's up to Activision, then no, they won't.

226
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:45,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's up to Microsoft, then yes, they will.

227
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:52,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And you remember, Microsoft, they have strict regulations about their accessories and peripherals that they all have to play nice with each other.

228
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

229
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,762
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit pisses me off if they don't play nice.

230
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:59,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I get pissed off, we do the FUs of the week.

231
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight since DarkSakura is not here?

232
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:24,897
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Gravity for pulling the mustard out of my sandwich and staining my shirt and my shorts with delicious mustard.

233
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Rice Princess, since you're filling in tonight, would you care to give an F you for anything?

234
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:35,767
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to Hollywood After Dark for showing Rue McClanahan stripping.

235
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we need to describe Bad Movie Night really quick?

236
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, do it, do it.

237
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Give him a rundown of Bad Movie Night.

238
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,649
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't talked at all tonight.

239
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:44,649
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, man.

240
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Bad Movie Night is where we pick bad movies, bad but entertaining movies to watch.

241
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, none of my movies got picked.

242
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:56,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought Follow That Bird, the Sesame Street adaptation from 1980s, but my choice was not Scream last night.

243
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't bad enough, I guess.

244
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:00,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that bad of a movie.

245
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:01,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a classic.

246
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,648
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all pushing 30.

247
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty bad in retrospect.

248
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:06,090
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

249
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:06,750
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

250
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:14,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we watched Sleepaway Camp, which I've seen numerous times, but there were a few people that hadn't seen it yet, so that's funny.

251
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:18,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God I'll ban you from chat if you ruin the twist ending to Sleepaway Camp.

252
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, do not do it.

253
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Best twist ending ever in a movie, Sleepaway Camp.

254
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:23,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you haven't seen it, watch it.

255
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:27,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to watch it, and I swear to God, strap yourself to the chair and force yourself to watch it.

256
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,107
[SPEAKER_06]: The twist ending is worth it.

257
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just get through it.

258
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:35,529
[SPEAKER_04]: and you gotta love the line where the guy goes, I gotta take a wicked dump.

259
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,351
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

260
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:38,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Sleepless Camp.

261
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an ultimate bad movie.

262
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:43,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we watched this other movie which, what was it?

263
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like something ninjas or like... We watched it fast forward.

264
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:48,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Karate Kids.

265
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:50,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Karate Kids USA I think is what it was called.

266
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it was horrible.

267
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:58,507
[SPEAKER_04]: We fast forwarded through most of that, but there was a part where the kid called this black biker a souffle.

268
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:01,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I don't know how that's an insult, but whatever.

269
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:03,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's all, no one calls me a souffle.

270
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:04,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you later.

271
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what?

272
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:11,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And they basically have a battle of hillbillies in the forest or something.

273
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so tell us about the Rue McClanahan movie.

274
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:16,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Rue McClanahan movie, that was Hollywood After Dark.

275
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:19,072
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, she was Blanche on the Golden Girls, just in case you didn't know.

276
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:21,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Hollywood After Dark.

277
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:26,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, the film was a part of this, what do they call it, the film crew.

278
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:35,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the guys that did Mystery Science Theater 3000, but now it's essentially the same damn thing, which is without the robots, and now they can swear and stuff during that.

279
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty funny.

280
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But she was playing the stripper, and they made her strip, and it was...

281
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the comments they made were really funny.

282
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:48,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was these weird chicks that they had stripping.

283
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,632
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no nudity in this movie whatsoever.

284
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It was made in the 60s, so it was still taboo.

285
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Pasties was as far as it went.

286
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:58,978
[SPEAKER_04]: But they had some really ugly people just stripping, I guess.

287
00:16:59,178 --> 00:16:59,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

288
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:16,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, funny stuff.

289
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:21,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking we should do a Justin TV thing where we make fun of movies or something.

290
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:22,078
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

291
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie would love that, too.

292
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:23,959
[SPEAKER_06]: She loves bad movies.

293
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the Film Cruise website, and they have podcasts that are meant for different movies, and you can play them at the same time as you're watching the movie.

294
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

295
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Like newer movies?

296
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:32,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Newer movies, yeah.

297
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:33,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

298
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:37,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I mean, I highly, after watching this, because this seriously was, it's...

299
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:56,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, absolutely, without a doubt, I mean, just nothing cut down whatsoever, no watered down, in fact, it was a little bit better, I think, because they were able to, you know, say stuff like, you know, make penis jokes and stuff like that, but absolutely awesome, check out the website, so.

300
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we got on a tangent.

301
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:01,156
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that, well, this is actually a good thing.

302
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:05,619
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been one month since I've been out of the hospital, as of today, for, you know, when I was in there for pancreatitis.

303
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But the FU goes to the fact that I'm not sure it's completely gone.

304
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:11,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I still get chest pains once in a while, and that's kind of irritating.

305
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,364
[SPEAKER_06]: But I found out on Friday.

306
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:13,225
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

307
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:14,286
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to blood tests.

308
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:22,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when the nurse gives you this really horrible tape that, I swear to God, I've tried to wash this off like five times this week, and the residue from the tape is still not coming off.

309
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:23,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

310
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

311
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:34,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about Fatal Inertia.

312
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:38,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Fatal Inertia, this is the interesting thing about it.

313
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be coming out as a PlayStation 3 launch title.

314
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Then apparently it was going to be on the Xbox 360.

315
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's back on the PlayStation Network.

316
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out for the 360.

317
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:51,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it?

318
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it did like last September, I think.

319
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,048
[SPEAKER_06]: As an arcade title?

320
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're supposed to be making it better, so...

321
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:20,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

322
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:25,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the EX, Facial Inertia EX is coming out to the PlayStation Network.

323
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:28,705
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's what confuses me because it was coming on PSN, whereas the other one was on 360.

324
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:30,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought it was an arcade title.

325
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:31,865
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I get it now.

326
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess not a lot of people got it on the 360 because I didn't even know about it.

327
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:36,726
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

328
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:42,488
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be adding to it a brand new training mode, more tracks in the game, and apparently the game is not as difficult.

329
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: They've actually lowered the difficulty a little bit.

330
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,411
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

331
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,460
[SPEAKER_04]: $29.99 late May is when this game is coming out.

332
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's about the price I think the other one was too.

333
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was $39.99 when it came out.

334
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

335
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:08,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mega Man has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records Gamer Edition.

336
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a chance to check this out at a bookstore the other day.

337
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:13,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was pretty well put together.

338
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:19,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still laugh at the fact that there's gaming world records in there and they're kind of retarded.

339
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:19,639
[SPEAKER_04]: But

340
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:30,383
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently there are 46 Mega Man games in existence, making it the largest franchise out there.

341
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:43,489
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 17 games in the Classic Series, 11 Mega Man X games, 4 Mega Man Zero games, 2 Mega Man ZX games, 3 Mega Man Legend games, 6 Mega Man Battle Network games, and 3 Mega Man Star Force games.

342
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's a lot more coming out as well.

343
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:49,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

344
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:51,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

345
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:53,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Mega Man.

346
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,336
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was tempted, though.

347
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:57,898
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day I saw the Mega Man Collection, which was a game I think I rented once.

348
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:01,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great because, you know, the old school Mega Man games are awesome.

349
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they have the new one that came out.

350
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not that new now, but it came out on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

351
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can play old GameCube games on your Wii.

352
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:14,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that Blockbuster we went to to get Sleepaway Camp the other day had the Mega Man Collection for sale for GameCube, a previously played copy.

353
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:14,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifteen bucks.

354
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:16,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost bought it.

355
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:22,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking, like, why not buy that and then, you know, because it's going to come out on Virtual Console eventually.

356
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That was 1999 when it first came out, so.

357
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:25,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but still.

358
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: 15's not bad.

359
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:28,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheap.

360
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:31,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like six, seven Mega Man games.

361
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:31,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight, maybe.

362
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:33,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember how many were in there, but a lot.

363
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:35,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Only three of them are really even worth playing anyway.

364
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:36,209
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

365
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:39,150
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the first three that were ever created, so.

366
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,470
[SPEAKER_06]: HitStun says, don't get the GameCube one.

367
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:41,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

368
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the GameCube one had the remixed music, which was cool.

369
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:53,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that each version had, like, there was a PlayStation 2 and then there was a GameCube one, and I think each one had, like, a different unlockable game in there or something.

370
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:56,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, whatever.

371
00:21:56,534 --> 00:22:01,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably not actually going to get the game anyway, because, you know, Irene's going to call me this week, and she's going to be like, dude, Rob, Karazhan.

372
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be like, oh, fuck Mega Man.

373
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:07,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's read some mail. ...

374
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:14,504
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

375
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:41,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Really quickly, ShadowCharlie sent us an email about this whole article.

376
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:46,564
[SPEAKER_06]: He basically copy-pasted an article about the Mothers Against Drunk Driving attacking Grand Theft Auto 4.

377
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:47,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Retarded.

378
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:48,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And why is that?

379
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me give you the gist of what happened.

380
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:56,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're pissed because you can actually drive drunk in the game, and I believe it's the objective of one of the missions in the game.

381
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,811
[SPEAKER_06]: They're claiming Grand Theft Auto should be re-rated as adults only.

382
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not... That's the spin that they're putting on it.

383
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:05,534
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no... I mean, you can drive drunk in the game, but...

384
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:06,074
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

385
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:33,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can hail a cab, you know, to take you back home, but... Sensationalism around Grand Theft Auto 4?

386
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:34,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's crazy.

387
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:35,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, surely you jest.

388
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, and people, like, you know, claiming things that aren't actually in the game?

389
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:40,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's surprising.

390
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,532
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's so stupid, because you can do other shit in the games.

391
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:49,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, murder okay, drunk driving, whoa, that's taking it too far.

392
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, sir, you gotta change your rating.

393
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:55,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee in chat is screaming, it's not real driving, it's not real drunk.

394
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty cool the way it's done, though.

395
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole camera shakes around and stuff, and randomly your car will swerve in different directions.

396
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:07,779
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to kind of counter-steer for that, but I like it.

397
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's pretty cool.

398
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:13,765
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can ride animals while drunk in World of Warcraft, and no one says anything about that.

399
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:14,545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

400
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:17,028
[SPEAKER_04]: No one said anything about Saints Row.

401
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get high and stoned and stuff in that game.

402
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,152
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also get drunk and drive around and kill people.

403
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:29,334
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they kind of insist that when you are drunk, you have superpowers and can punch people really far away.

404
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

405
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

406
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:32,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

407
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:33,981
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

408
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:36,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to the next email from GS68.

409
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:43,291
[SPEAKER_06]: HeyOLRCrew, specifically Loki and RobRobRob, I have a bad feeling about your appearance at Fonamay.

410
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not listed under the panel section of the Fonamay 2008 site at Fonamay.com.

411
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:50,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to try and make a last-minute arrangement or something?

412
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:56,322
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no OLR panel this year, then I suppose us Bay Area OLR fans will just have to find some other way to meet up at Fonamay.

413
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:01,027
[SPEAKER_06]: This email brought to you by Hooters, home of the never-ending girls' butts.

414
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:03,708
[SPEAKER_06]: God, that Olive Garden thing is caught on.

415
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:05,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's signing their emails with strange things now.

416
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're going to have to break the news to you.

417
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,330
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not attending Fanime this year.

418
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,930
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not plan on doing a live panel this year.

419
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:12,291
[SPEAKER_06]: It is nothing against Fanime.

420
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:14,052
[SPEAKER_06]: We still love the staff and everything.

421
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,113
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is that Jamie has other plans this year.

422
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:19,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And quite frankly, it's a three-day weekend.

423
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:22,675
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the few that us working kids have during the year.

424
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we just want to take the weekend to kind of do other things.

425
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:32,419
[SPEAKER_06]: and also since we're going to be hopefully doing PAX and some other shows later in the year, we've just decided to sit this one out.

426
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:33,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

427
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anybody going to Fanime just for fun?

428
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of curiosity?

429
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:39,741
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

430
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:42,582
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first year you haven't been to Fanime in a long time, isn't it?

431
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:43,543
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it hasn't.

432
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:44,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you went like every year.

433
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:46,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to like when I was in the anime.

434
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,045
[SPEAKER_04]: What, like five years ago?

435
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:54,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, it was only really like three years in a row.

436
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:01,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, still, those of you guys that are going to Fanime, we hope you have a lot, a lot of fun, and good luck.

437
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:05,155
[SPEAKER_06]: ASEN is being yelled in chat, and ASEN is too soon.

438
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:06,136
[SPEAKER_06]: ASEN is very soon.

439
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:16,083
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, I was originally wanting to go to ASEN, but my medical things came up, and I had to put it aside, because that kind of stuff is more important for me right now.

440
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:16,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next year.

441
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:17,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really hoping.

442
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:23,349
[SPEAKER_06]: PAX is the most definite right now, and you never know what else might happen in the future.

443
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a con...

444
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:31,452
[SPEAKER_06]: that's drivable, or let's say in California or like Reno or even Oregon, hell, let us know.

445
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,112
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to come if you'd like to have us there.

446
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:37,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, if it's something we've got to fly to, it just depends on the budget.

447
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:43,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And by budget, I mean how much money we have in our pockets because we don't, you notice we don't run ads on this show, meaning we have no money.

448
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark from Plymouth, England sends us the next email.

449
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:50,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bit long, so I'm just going to read some of this here.

450
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:56,378
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, although the track of this message may lead you to at first think that I might be.

451
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to start by saying that here in the UK, there's no real Nintendo history.

452
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:11,027
[SPEAKER_06]: As back as in the 80s, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum ruled the gaming of everyone, and Nintendo was almost unknown to me and my friends until I was too old and busy with serious dating to get back into it.

453
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, the NES and SNES were pretty much unknown things.

454
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:22,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Now my main point, Wii isn't increasing the gamer base as mentioned by you on episode 277, and often it's a war cry by many of the too many podcasts I listen to.

455
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you don't hate the Wii and are open about its strengths and weaknesses.

456
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:32,555
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I believe, not as my personal experience, that as I am a gamer, definitely not hardcore, although I'm very much into all the latest news.

457
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:35,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I am presently most all about handhelds due to access issues to the big ass TV.

458
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: My Wii is also freely played by my wife, who would categorize herself as a non-gamer, and her family.

459
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:48,365
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, my next night shift has been scheduled for a Wii Fit Night, in which my wife has invited her friends and sisters for drinks and laughs on the board.

460
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:54,429
[SPEAKER_06]: This type of sociability has led all the family to buying Wiis, and they are now the prime console.

461
00:27:54,449 --> 00:28:02,996
[SPEAKER_06]: The collateral fallout is that many others in the household now play, whereas before, one person, maybe two, per household, played the kids and parents are buying games for the Wii.

462
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any figures on players per console for old and present gen?

463
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:09,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to bet the figure has risen.

464
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything like that?

465
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:11,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt it.

466
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:14,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

467
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:20,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to kind of cut some of this email out, but he was just sort of making the point that the Wii is definitely kind of caught on in that way.

468
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,799
[SPEAKER_06]: But what about the software?

469
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,861
[SPEAKER_06]: He talks about why do some shovelware games sell well?

470
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:30,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the taste of light gamers are different in a lot of early games to the Wii or games ported over from PS2 games?

471
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because people don't know any better.

472
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:41,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The moms and pops that are going to stores that are buying their kids' games, they look at it, they're like, okay, well, they can get Mario Kart and they can get this other game that looks very similar.

473
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:45,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And all they have to go by is the pictures on the back and stuff and the price point.

474
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:51,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, well, it's $20 cheaper or $30 cheaper, so hey, let's go ahead and give it a shot.

475
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, it's just like movies.

476
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:57,647
[SPEAKER_04]: You may go to your rental store or whatever and

477
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:04,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking at the back of the movie and all you have to go by is the cover and what it says on the back and you can bring it home and it's complete shit.

478
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:11,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't dipped my toes into the HD gaming experience.

479
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the PS3, but I'm not sure due to price and limited titles, although a good 6 would do for me for now.

480
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Metal Gear Solid as it just doesn't float my boat.

481
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I hate cutscenes.

482
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:25,874
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox 360 has a catalog, but I get burned on the original Xbox when shortly after buying one, they went and retired it for the 360.

483
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, my brother has gone through four 360s.

484
00:29:29,597 --> 00:29:30,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So is now a good time to buy a 360?

485
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Have the issues of Red Ring of Death been cured?

486
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Or should I wait a little longer as the trading games pile is getting bigger every day?

487
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:39,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Is a smaller, cooler 360 on the horizon?

488
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:46,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's an old question from last year and before, but now that 360 is maturing, has it lost its legs and arthritis is setting in?

489
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is now the time to jump in?

490
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,633
[SPEAKER_06]: An arcade is cheaper than the Wii right now.

491
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:52,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no intention of going online.

492
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:54,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Is a hard drive necessary for the download content?

493
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:57,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do I have to accept that patches are the way of the future?

494
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:03,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that it's probably fine to buy it now.

495
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:08,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 360's probably going to be at its peak for the next couple years.

496
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:15,289
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right, the system's matured, but that's when all the really good games start coming out over the next couple years, and then we'll start getting into a new cycle of systems.

497
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:21,772
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as hardware problems go, the new 360's that they have out now aren't really as prone to the hardware problems as

498
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:23,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

499
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:43,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what you've got to watch out for, is that maybe a new 360 is going to come out.

500
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,541
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really inevitable with every console, but there were some strong rumors this week.

501
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm spoiling anything on show roll.

502
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:54,784
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some very strong rumors this week about the Blu-ray, and I guess actually a press release was put out, so it might be more than rumor.

503
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:59,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox 360 is actually going to be getting a Blu-ray in it.

504
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's been contracted to actually put...

505
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that technology together where the Blu-ray Xbox 360 is going to be coming out.

506
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Because HD DVD is officially dead.

507
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:13,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft has left them no choice but to get on the Blu-ray board if they want their system to play movies as well.

508
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:14,556
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not DVD.

509
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:15,276
[SPEAKER_06]: HD movies.

510
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:18,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got to be careful because you never know what's going to happen.

511
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,660
[SPEAKER_06]: The day after you buy your system, this might come out.

512
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's just a chance you take.

513
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:24,782
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens with anything.

514
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:27,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask anyone who owns an Apple product.

515
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,387
[SPEAKER_06]: You buy an iPhone and then a few months later, SUPER IPHONE!

516
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:35,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch, there will be a super iPhone this year, just so you know.

517
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:41,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT wrote us and wanted to get in a few words about this.

518
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get in a few words on the idea of gays in gaming.

519
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:47,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexuality isn't anywhere near as taboo as it was five or so years ago.

520
00:31:47,843 --> 00:31:51,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it seems that every other game is so chock full of cock teasing that it borders on the tasteless.

521
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:58,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead or Alive is built entirely upon sexual exploitation and the guy game was only pulled off the shelves because it featured an underage girl going topless.

522
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:06,551
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason we don't see gay characters in games or even a very deep exploration of sexuality besides making women as slutty as possible has nothing to do with the rating systems out there.

523
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:09,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Conan and God of War had frontal nudity, as you know.

524
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:12,134
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem here is the striking lack of diversity in the gaming industry.

525
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:17,177
[SPEAKER_06]: While game players come from all faiths, colors, creeds, and orientations, game developers do not.

526
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:18,177
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

527
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:46,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want to get other audiences into gaming, maybe you ought to start putting that kind of stuff into games.

528
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:50,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think they also run the problem with the ESRB.

529
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,286
[SPEAKER_04]: They rate that kind of crap more offensive than female nudity.

530
00:32:57,162 --> 00:33:00,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, Rostu goes on Of course, I can't talk about this without mentioning the audience.

531
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:05,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to any internet gaming forum before that matter, Xbox Live, and you'll find rampant sexism and homophobia.

532
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:10,367
[SPEAKER_06]: One need only look at what happened to Jade Raymond, leaning up to the launch of Assassin's Creed.

533
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:18,050
[SPEAKER_06]: For months last year, sites like Kotaku and Joystick were more concerned with making creepy blogs about how nice she looked and smelled than covering the goddamn game.

534
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:26,373
[SPEAKER_06]: The idiocy climaxed in a horrific comic depicting Jade, a well-educated, experienced professional game developer, as a brainless bimbo who can't even pronounce creative

535
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:27,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

536
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:49,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Thus, we get more objectified women and the role of gay characters is limited to the joke character like Makoto from Enchanted Arms.

537
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:56,451
[SPEAKER_06]: With time, as gaming businesses learn the importance of demographics and stop belittling people who aren't straight, white men, this will pass.

538
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:57,752
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need to hang on.

539
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:01,954
[SPEAKER_06]: This message brought to you by Pizza Hut, makers of the pure grease pizza.

540
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:05,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

541
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:06,859
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Irene?

542
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,420
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a woman, an OMG girl that plays video games.

543
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:22,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that games aren't coming out geared more towards women because... See, there's a stereotype that women love playing puzzle games.

544
00:34:22,823 --> 00:34:28,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's so much that as it is puzzle games don't have overly sexualized women in the games.

545
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:30,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Says the woman that plays Puzzle Pirates.

546
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:44,800
[SPEAKER_09]: No, yeah, I mean, that's part of the reason, because I don't have to think about, like, okay, I'm going to see some, you know, slutty thing, some woman, like, you know, sluttified in this game or whatever, but... Although, that sounds like a good idea for a puzzle game.

547
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:49,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Sluts How would Puzzle Sluts work?

548
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:12,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have, like... But they need to have... Okay, there needs to be, like, a code that you put in, like, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and you get male puzzle sluts.

549
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we need something for everybody in this game.

550
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I think I could see how this might work.

551
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:17,578
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

552
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:24,501
[SPEAKER_04]: You would have in each, like... So let's go the route of, like, say, Puzzle Fighter, okay?

553
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:24,901
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

554
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:28,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would have inside each one of the gems, like, a different woman.

555
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:32,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you break the gem, they would follow the bottom of the screen and, you know...

556
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:46,103
[SPEAKER_04]: more gems next to each other and they just start kind of going at it in the bottom of the screen until you get this big orgy that pile up in the bottom I like it brilliant brilliant patent pending

557
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody steal it.

558
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:50,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

559
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:51,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a good example.

560
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:53,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Heavenly Sword.

561
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:58,656
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how the main character is this hot chick that kicks ass and all that stuff?

562
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of detracted from it because it was just like, come on.

563
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,161
[SPEAKER_09]: That's totally not realistic.

564
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:10,226
[SPEAKER_09]: If she were just a normal girl, I probably would have been more inclined to play it.

565
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:14,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Been more focused on actual gameplay than like, oogling over her or whatever.

566
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But

567
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:16,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

568
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:27,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that something like putting gay characters or sensible women in games is something that's going to have to be left up to independent game producers.

569
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:39,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like, for example, Saints Row 2 that's coming out, you can be a male and or female character, or you can be a transsexual in the game and run around, and you can totally customize your characters and stuff.

570
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:39,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

571
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:44,216
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know people that are going to be playing Saints Row aren't going to be playing them like seriously.

572
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,041
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be playing them to mock them, so...

573
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta show you this, though.

574
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:49,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, does this pique your interest, Irene?

575
00:36:49,493 --> 00:36:58,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this story came up earlier this week, and I don't think it's on our show world tonight, but Lost Planet Colonies is going to be, I guess they're getting a new version of it coming out.

576
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's some type of expansion.

577
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:07,008
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the characters in it is the Dead Rising star, you know, Frank West, but he doesn't have clothes on.

578
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:11,012
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just wearing a skimpy little pair of blue and yellow boxer briefs.

579
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:11,813
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all he's wearing.

580
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, is that maybe the contrast to your heavenly sword?

581
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:18,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you maybe be interested in checking out Lost Planet Colonies?

582
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:21,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, hello, good-looking man running around in his skimpy undies.

583
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:23,237
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's debatable.

584
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:24,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think he looks good.

585
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:28,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's kind of retarded to be running around on this frozen wasteland.

586
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:29,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of weird.

587
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,563
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm fine.

588
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:31,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that won't do at all.

589
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:37,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess sex does sell, but do they really need to sexualize people?

590
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:38,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there are plenty of good games.

591
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:39,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, by the way, is clearing up.

592
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:41,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the greatest hits version of the game.

593
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they added more crap to it.

594
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:44,912
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I don't follow Lost Planet.

595
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:45,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

596
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:49,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when games, you didn't even have to care about their sexuality?

597
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:53,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario walking around in overalls and shit.

598
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but as I think stories become more... I mean, let's face it.

599
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games today are practically big-budget movies.

600
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:00,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, big-budget movies.

601
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:01,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know...

602
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd kind of like to see that sort of representation in movies as well.

603
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,492
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took a while for movies to get there, but it got there.

604
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:10,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, tell me which Yuna you like better.

605
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:14,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you like Yuna from Final Fantasy X, or do you like her better in X-2?

606
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:20,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy X is today I'm listening to Depeche Mode because I'm emo.

607
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:42,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it also depends on what kind of mood you're in.

608
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:49,503
[SPEAKER_09]: If you just want to play, like your motivation behind playing the game, but if it's strictly to like get off, it's just silly.

609
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:52,805
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, come on, is that what you're going to base your game on?

610
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:55,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Some kind of like sexy character or something?

611
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:57,349
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do more with what you have?

612
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,290
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't be creative?

613
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,200
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

614
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's do some more emails here because I want to get through the rest of these emails tonight.

615
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:05,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Ben from Tokyo has emailed us.

616
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:06,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Wanted to clear some things up.

617
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:07,209
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about Singapore.

618
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:16,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the gays gaming thing, we talked last week about how in Singapore they're adding homosexuality to what is instantly making a game adults only overseas.

619
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:20,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was Mass Effect was impacted by that because there was OMG lesbians for like five seconds in the game.

620
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:25,704
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ben wrote us, says, love the show, want to keep it short as I have to rant about some stuff.

621
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:26,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Singapore.

622
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,985
[SPEAKER_06]: In Singapore, it is basically illegal to be gay.

623
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Illegal as in you go to jail.

624
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:34,486
[SPEAKER_06]: More precise would be to say that anything openly gay is banned.

625
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:38,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Gays are not employed by public offices, not allowed to live in certain areas.

626
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,228
[SPEAKER_06]: That part also holds for certain foreigners.

627
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:41,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And homosexual acts are illegal.

628
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:45,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So complaining about the rating system is like accusing a serial killer of fashion crimes.

629
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:49,630
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, it is only the American rating system that is crazy about sexual topics.

630
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so disheartening to read.

631
00:39:52,311 --> 00:40:01,956
[SPEAKER_06]: You do have to remember that we are kind of lucky sometimes to live in a nation that at least we don't get arrested for it, even though there's still a lot of progress to make.

632
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:08,839
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at countries like Canada and Spain and wherever where gays can get married and it's just whatever.

633
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:13,541
[SPEAKER_06]: No one cares because it's not like, OMG, they're going to come into my house and redecorate things.

634
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:14,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out.

635
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:18,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, it just, whatever, you know?

636
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,124
[SPEAKER_06]: People are so much more laid back.

637
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:25,627
[SPEAKER_06]: But then sometimes you have to come to that harsh reality where like, wow, you know, America's way ahead of some other people.

638
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:26,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of just sad.

639
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Just sad.

640
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:33,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but even California is kind of more the exception anyway.

641
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:39,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you go to any other place in the U.S., you probably, they probably won't be as accepting.

642
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:39,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

643
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:40,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends.

644
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:41,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends.

645
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was saying last week, I think we're getting to a point, I think we're very lucky, where most 20-somethings and most younger 30-somethings and most teenagers even, I think teenagers even more so, everybody knows someone who's gay and more and more people just have the attitude of whatever.

646
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:59,244
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no big deal.

647
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:00,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just whatever.

648
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:05,107
[SPEAKER_06]: They realize it doesn't mean they're suddenly going to fuck me in the ass when I'm not looking.

649
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are over that real kind of childish mentality about it, you know what I mean?

650
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:14,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's like, is that what they're really afraid of?

651
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh my god, he's gonna come fuck me in the ass.

652
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:17,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

653
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:18,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.

654
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm left to assume.

655
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:22,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.

656
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:23,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

657
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:24,589
[SPEAKER_09]: It is stupid.

658
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:26,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Copyright.

659
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Ben wanted to say something about copyright too.

660
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:35,731
[SPEAKER_06]: While you just mentioned it briefly, I have to say that downloading fan subs and any other copyrighted material is of course illegal, even if there is no licensing in your country.

661
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:38,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Without licensing, there is just nobody to complain about it.

662
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:39,272
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't make it legal.

663
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:41,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Thus, fan subs are in a somewhat gray area.

664
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:48,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Note that this only holds if your country has a copyright law, which, for example, Thailand at least didn't have for a long time.

665
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:52,959
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of came up on last week's show about the whole copyright thing went back and forth.

666
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:53,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

667
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:54,820
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

668
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,301
[SPEAKER_06]: More emails.

669
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a lot tonight, but actually these are pretty good.

670
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma emailed us, very happy.

671
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:06,968
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a mention of Video Power on last week's show and was kind of running down Video Power a little bit.

672
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,130
[SPEAKER_06]: The first season had Johnny Arcade.

673
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:14,434
[SPEAKER_06]: He would come into the room, talk about games for five minutes that he's going to review, and then there was a 20-minute cartoon.

674
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But the second season was a game show.

675
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Four people would get a chance to ask Johnny a question to compete on the show.

676
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,759
[SPEAKER_06]: First round was getting the highest score in a game.

677
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Second round was trivia questions.

678
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,865
[SPEAKER_06]: After that was the round where you ran through the game area and you could get, you know, Jansport bags, Genesis, and Neo Geo console.

679
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:34,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I pretty much think that Acclaim did a majority of the sponsorship of the show, but I could be wrong.

680
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:35,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's it for now.

681
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:39,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work and y'all in two months for OLRCon 2008.

682
00:42:39,872 --> 00:42:40,632
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an OLRCon 2008?

683
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:41,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

684
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:44,495
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell have I been?

685
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:45,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

686
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:46,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Where have you been?

687
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:52,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard something was going down over Fourth of July, but I didn't know we were actually having a little convention.

688
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:53,335
[SPEAKER_06]: What the crap?

689
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:54,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I always the last one to hear about this?

690
00:42:54,976 --> 00:42:55,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Hear about what?

691
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:58,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there's no Alarcon happening.

692
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Fourth of July.

693
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:01,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

694
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, you need to email me and tell me.

695
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I've not been told about this.

696
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Nor have I. Or I forgot.

697
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:07,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

698
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:08,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm human.

699
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:09,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have forgot.

700
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:10,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go.

701
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:13,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously, if it's all our con, I guess I'll go.

702
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:14,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

703
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:16,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just kind of curious what's going on.

704
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's advertise it on the show if something's going on.

705
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:27,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Ranma closes with, this email was brought to you by Joey Paisanos of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.

706
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:28,306
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll love Paisanos.

707
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:31,405
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

708
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I think RustyLUT was completely off the mark last week with his rants over reviews, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

709
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:02,811
[SPEAKER_06]: If a game is bad, such as Lair, then the review scores will reflect it.

710
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:07,295
[SPEAKER_06]: If the game is good, such as Grand Theft Auto 4, then the review scores will reflect that as well.

711
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:07,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Thoughts?

712
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:08,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work.

713
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:09,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

714
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:14,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I never said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was probably not going to get 10s out of 10s from everywhere.

715
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:17,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably pretty deserving of those 10s out of 10s.

716
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:22,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying that kind of policy about, you know, sure we'll accept the exclusive.

717
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:22,561
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

718
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:28,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they came out and admitted that they had traded for advertising on the site to get the exclusive review.

719
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:33,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that kind of sets a bad precedent because, yes, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a good, good game, I don't know.

720
00:44:33,946 --> 00:44:35,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What about games in the future?

721
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:40,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they said, oh yeah, this didn't affect our review score.

722
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:44,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not forget about what went down at GameSpot and Kane and Lynch.

723
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:44,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

724
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:56,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's not forget what happened to GameSpot and Grand Theft Auto 4, where there was a review that leaked out that gave it a 9.5, and then that was retracted, and there was a 10.0 review put out.

725
00:44:57,457 --> 00:44:58,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's to say that they weren't going to do that?

726
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently there was a process where they rate it, and then they do a peer review process, and then they re-rate it or some shit like that.

727
00:45:07,523 --> 00:45:08,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just...

728
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:21,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fishy, and not to say that this game wouldn't have gotten high marks anyways, but it's still fishy, and it's not a really good situation to be in, especially after the whole Kane and Lynch thing.

729
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:24,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, do people really give a shit?

730
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we rated it 9.5, but really it's a 10.

731
00:45:27,718 --> 00:45:28,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We were off by .5.

732
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:31,101
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, okay, it's a good game.

733
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: We get what you're conveying with your ranking.

734
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:36,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just more crap that they can throw up in their advertising campaigns for it.

735
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:37,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been rated a 10 by IGN.

736
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:40,307
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 out of 10.

737
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,872
[SPEAKER_04]: They can throw that in their commercials and advertise that shit.

738
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:47,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just more points for them, I guess.

739
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:51,507
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

740
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:55,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's our thoughts on that, and that's going to do it for the mailbag.

741
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,611
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

742
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:07,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you guys for future weeks, honestly, the more condensed you can make your emails, the better, because our mailbag segment has been going kind of long lately, so we're going to have to start getting choosier.

743
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:14,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do try to condense down big emails, but if you can do that, it makes it all the better.

744
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So just so you know.

745
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:19,364
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go off for a longer period of time, there is always a Skype line.

746
00:46:19,384 --> 00:46:21,785
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to us live Sunday nights on allgames.com.

747
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:23,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back into the gaming news.

748
00:46:25,066 --> 00:46:25,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

749
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,973
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new card game coming out, not Eye of Judgment, but it's being released by EA.

750
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:38,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Battleforge, the collectible trading card game.

751
00:46:38,914 --> 00:46:46,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming up this fall and doesn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but they're comparing it to, of course, Magic the Gathering.

752
00:46:47,298 --> 00:46:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fantasy online real-time strategy game with collectible trading cards.

753
00:46:54,221 --> 00:46:54,481
[SPEAKER_04]: One to one.

754
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:24,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, developers these days love these things where they can just charge extra money for the expansions and all that stuff, huh?

755
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

756
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,182
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a collectible card game.

757
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:32,264
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're trying to do is they're trying to make a game that captures, you know, the fans of, like, Magic the Gathering.

758
00:47:32,324 --> 00:47:42,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be at, you know, the same level as Magic the Gathering and get people, you know, buying these card decks and stuff like that as much as possible.

759
00:47:42,547 --> 00:47:42,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

760
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:45,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

761
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:49,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's a good idea strategy wise, but will people fall for it?

762
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:49,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

763
00:47:50,856 --> 00:47:53,738
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, R-Type Command is coming out on May 6th.

764
00:47:53,778 --> 00:47:54,799
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming out on the PSP.

765
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It's R-Type the strategy game, which ought to be interesting.

766
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:15,233
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's kind of cool about this is that Atlus has actually announced that they are going to be putting out, just for a limited time, and just for those that buy the game from either GameStop, Amazon, GameCrazy, EB Games Canada, and some other specific retailers, they get to get a little free plastic miniature replica of the R9 spacecraft.

767
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:15,893
[SPEAKER_06]: TechMobile Kickoff

768
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,722
[SPEAKER_04]: will be landing on the DS.

769
00:48:42,043 --> 00:48:45,943
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't really said too many details on it yet, but here's what we do know.

770
00:48:45,983 --> 00:48:48,884
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a variety of teams with 32 to choose from.

771
00:48:49,624 --> 00:49:08,147
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be all new cutscenes showing off dramatic presentations of various plays, a customizable playbook, stylus control, of course it's going to have Wi-Fi and wireless multiplayer, customizable teams, and it's based on, of course, Tecmo Super Bowl.

772
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:12,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

773
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,721
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, tonight we were going to be doing the match game, but unfortunately we didn't get around to it.

774
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:25,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Our resources were a little limited this week, so just a reminder, because this is the point where we were supposed to do match game, but we're tabling it to next week.

775
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:27,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, kids.

776
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:28,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Our contestants are already picked.

777
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Toshin and Footy showdown for the ResCode.

778
00:49:32,048 --> 00:49:33,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And if one of them's not here, then we'll get somebody else.

779
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:35,954
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

780
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:04,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, South Korea, a 5.1% price drop.

781
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:07,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And Taiwan, a 17% price drop.

782
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:11,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's very interesting.

783
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:14,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess those price drops have already happened.

784
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,261
[SPEAKER_04]: They happened earlier last week.

785
00:50:19,465 --> 00:50:20,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for price drops.

786
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,086
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes some people very happy.

787
00:50:22,546 --> 00:50:24,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, kids, we're going to be opening up the Skype line very soon.

788
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:27,608
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

789
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:29,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

790
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:32,490
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we have a couple more quick stories for you guys.

791
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,152
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is the Famicom Mobile, or I'm sorry, the FC Mobile.

792
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:40,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably should say it the other way because, you know, that would be a complete ripoff of the name.

793
00:50:40,973 --> 00:50:42,574
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess, I mean, it seems like the...

794
00:50:44,094 --> 00:50:48,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Patent on Nintendo's thing has expired or something because all these Nintendo knockoffs have been coming out lately.

795
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:57,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And now one of them is a mobile system that will actually, not mobile phones, but a mobile system that will actually play Nintendo games on the go.

796
00:50:57,906 --> 00:51:00,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It can actually take the old Nintendo cartridges.

797
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a 2.4 inch color LCD screen.

798
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs on three AA batteries.

799
00:51:05,072 --> 00:51:07,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got speakers, a place to plug in headphones.

800
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:10,977
[SPEAKER_06]: You can plug the unit into the TV and play the NES games on the TV.

801
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:16,320
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's being sold I guess overseas but it only plays American NES games.

802
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find them on eBay for $40 to $50.

803
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:28,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because the patent expired for the original NES which makes me think in a couple of years the patent's going to expire on the Super Nintendo, right?

804
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:31,870
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start seeing more and more of these as years go on.

805
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:37,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty soon every CD player will have a PlayStation 1 in it when that patent expires.

806
00:51:37,254 --> 00:51:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be interesting.

807
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:39,996
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

808
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:44,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they renew the patent, in which case, then, uh-oh.

809
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is interesting.

810
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:50,338
[SPEAKER_04]: This is almost like seeing a unicorn, I guess.

811
00:51:50,499 --> 00:51:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, Shack News website has actually seen Duke Nukem Forever, the game, in reality.

812
00:51:57,543 --> 00:51:58,043
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

813
00:51:58,503 --> 00:52:00,744
[SPEAKER_04]: They've actually seen the real game being played.

814
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:06,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, I guess, Shack News is very close to 3D Realms offices.

815
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:07,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

816
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:26,566
[SPEAKER_04]: They were shown about half an hour of footage from the game, I guess gameplay, including some environmental puzzles, interactivity, a host of finished weapons, an existence of an in-game forklift, and plenty of heads and arms.

817
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:28,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, a forklift?

818
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:28,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

819
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fork?

820
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

821
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:43,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, it says, apparently 3D Realms, George Broussard, the developer, said, out of the blue, I just decided to show them Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour.

822
00:52:44,874 --> 00:52:52,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would like to see Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour, and I'm sure a lot of other people would too, to at least, I don't know, how about an idea?

823
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:55,696
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you show the world Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour?

824
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,416
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you show them for like two minutes?

825
00:52:57,516 --> 00:52:57,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Two minutes?

826
00:52:57,996 --> 00:52:58,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

827
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that so much to ask?

828
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:02,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

829
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:04,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

830
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:08,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's really, really going to come out?

831
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:10,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will, but I think it will underwhelm everybody.

832
00:53:12,446 --> 00:53:12,866
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

833
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:14,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's kind of like Prey.

834
00:53:14,466 --> 00:53:19,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I enjoyed Prey, it was kind of underwhelming to a lot of people because there was so much that went into it.

835
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,967
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

836
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:21,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Like so much hype and everything that went into it.

837
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:23,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess it kind of disappointed.

838
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:26,508
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing about Prey, it like ended like that.

839
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:29,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the ending was just like kind of out of the middle of nowhere.

840
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:29,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of weird.

841
00:53:31,385 --> 00:53:33,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear there's a sequel being planned though, so we'll see what happens with that.

842
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line finally.

843
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:44,413
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

844
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:51,197
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always find out more about the Skype line and how it works if you go to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

845
00:53:51,237 --> 00:53:54,839
[SPEAKER_06]: That gives you the whole spiel about how the Skype line works.

846
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:55,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

847
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

848
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:57,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

849
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:03,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I got balls of steel Oh, I'm sorry, you're a little quiet What's that, sir?

850
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:07,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I got balls of steel You have balls of steel

851
00:54:09,022 --> 00:54:10,043
[SPEAKER_01]: This is DJ Dark Knight.

852
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:11,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, DJ Dark Knight?

853
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:11,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

854
00:54:12,224 --> 00:54:16,086
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting a little happy about the news about Duke Nukem Forever.

855
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:21,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, just basically doing the running gag of jokes everybody else is posting about the balls of steel thing.

856
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:24,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, the audio quality on this call is no bueno.

857
00:54:25,611 --> 00:54:26,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's going on there.

858
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:33,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight, your call quality is like really staticky and it's probably going to drive our podcast listeners nuts.

859
00:54:33,675 --> 00:54:37,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurry up and get, I'm going to give you like 10 seconds to get your question out and then we're going to have to let you go.

860
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:45,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, um, just basically about the, um, I'm a little bit late to the show because I've basically been testing something else out.

861
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:56,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, mostly about the, um, GTA 4 situation and whatnot and, I mean, how much longer do you think the man is going to be before he finally dies off?

862
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,051
[SPEAKER_06]: How long what is going to be before it dies off?

863
00:55:00,712 --> 00:55:02,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the demand is going to be before it dies off.

864
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:04,213
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll answer your question, Dark Knight.

865
00:55:04,253 --> 00:55:04,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

866
00:55:05,494 --> 00:55:07,675
[SPEAKER_06]: How long do you think it is going to be before the demand dies off?

867
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look at all the other games that have come out.

868
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:10,957
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been selling well for years.

869
00:55:11,117 --> 00:55:13,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas still sells really well.

870
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:18,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to keep selling through Christmas.

871
00:55:18,204 --> 00:55:18,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's why.

872
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:21,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not everybody's up to the HD age.

873
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:21,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

874
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,746
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this whole domino effect going on.

875
00:55:23,786 --> 00:55:25,867
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to stay out there.

876
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:26,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because of the domino effect.

877
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: By February 2009, lots of people are going to have to buy new TVs.

878
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they only have to buy digital converters for their TVs.

879
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind, this is, I believe, America only.

880
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:40,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if Canada is affected by this or other countries.

881
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:43,335
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least in America, they have passed this thing where...

882
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: all television will be digital signals by February of 2009.

883
00:55:48,298 --> 00:55:50,739
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to get this digital converter for your television.

884
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,422
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's happening is most people are getting scared, like they don't understand it.

885
00:55:54,702 --> 00:55:57,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So most people are just using it to buy a new TV that has digital in it.

886
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:03,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people, especially when you start talking about tax rebates, the stimulus coming up and everything,

887
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:04,168
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

888
00:56:20,646 --> 00:56:40,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the Xbox 360 and Blu-ray thing may be true they're going to want to get that out there by Christmas because they want to get a part of this domino effect because they get the high def TVs then they're going to buy the Blu-ray players and then of course you want to buy games you play on these systems Grand Theft Auto has a lot of name recognition this thing will continue to sell through Christmas for that reason agree?

889
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:42,654
[SPEAKER_04]: yes

890
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:44,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, good.

891
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:45,228
[SPEAKER_06]: You should always agree with me.

892
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:50,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

893
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:53,614
[SPEAKER_06]: While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

894
00:56:53,905 --> 00:57:03,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Resistance Fall of Man 2 is going to be playable at the PlayStation Day, which is coming out on Tuesday, May 6th.

895
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:08,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure we're going to see a lot of press releases coming out of that probably pretty soon.

896
00:57:09,118 --> 00:57:15,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else also kind of tying in with PlayStation Day, Motorstorm 2 has had a name change.

897
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:17,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's being renamed Motorstorm Pacific Rift.

898
00:57:18,723 --> 00:57:22,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So, meaning it's Motor Store 1 re-skimmed.

899
00:57:22,345 --> 00:57:23,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, caller, are you there?

900
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:23,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

901
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,748
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Spazinator.

902
00:57:26,188 --> 00:57:26,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

903
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:28,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Spazinator.

904
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:31,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Spell that for me.

905
00:57:31,812 --> 00:57:34,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the screen name I usually go by is Spazinator.

906
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:36,735
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what's your question?

907
00:57:36,775 --> 00:57:37,435
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

908
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:44,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was wondering, now that GTA 4 is out, do you think we're going to be...

909
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:51,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing from the lawyer that we shall not name, we're going to see where those are.

910
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawsuits coming out of the woodwork?

911
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:19,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Pin it on Grand Theft Auto and try to sue the makers and try to get the game pulled from shelves.

912
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:26,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And heaven forbid if there's any hidden things this time around, although I'm sure Take-Two took extra, extra precaution.

913
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:31,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rockstar, they all took extra, extra precaution to make sure there's nothing hidden on that disc.

914
00:58:32,307 --> 00:58:40,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there something mentioned maybe a few months ago?

915
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:45,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone here, correct me if I'm wrong, but some kind of

916
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:51,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Injunction or something on this guy, you know, saying that, you know, he can't sue anyone or...

917
00:58:53,453 --> 00:58:57,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say Take-Two complained about him in the court.

918
00:58:57,836 --> 00:59:02,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, he has to get someone else to sign off on any lawsuit that he does.

919
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,481
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, there is still right now... But only in Florida, right?

920
00:59:06,322 --> 00:59:07,503
[SPEAKER_04]: No, anywhere.

921
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he can only practice law in Florida.

922
00:59:10,545 --> 00:59:12,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have to be registered there.

923
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:19,552
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, he's actually only able... Right now, they're still doing a hearing on whether he's going to be disbarred anyway.

924
00:59:19,672 --> 00:59:21,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's still pending.

925
00:59:23,086 --> 00:59:29,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say one more thing before I let you guys get going to the next caller.

926
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:39,172
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this may be just me, but I think we should probably promote this game as much as possible and get people to buy this game as much as possible.

927
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:43,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just annoying that, you know what, I have this lawyer along with Hillary Clinton.

928
00:59:44,234 --> 00:59:48,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the more PO these guys get, at least in my book, the better, right?

929
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:58,266
[SPEAKER_06]: What we really have to do, here's the strategy, is that, I mean, yeah, there's one way to doing it, but what we really have to try and do is not give this guy any credit.

930
00:59:58,286 --> 01:00:01,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to stop covering every little move he makes.

931
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:04,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and I've used this comparison on the show before a while ago, but I haven't said it in a while.

932
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,951
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the village idiot in our minds.

933
01:00:07,272 --> 01:00:09,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time this guy does something, we publish it.

934
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Look what the village idiot did today, you know.

935
01:00:12,995 --> 01:00:14,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the lawsuit he filed today.

936
01:00:14,997 --> 01:00:16,798
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we need to stop giving him attention.

937
01:00:17,058 --> 01:00:17,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you know,

938
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you or any of our listeners or you guys, but when I was getting bullied in school, it's happened to all of us, don't laugh, Rice Princess, but when I was getting bullied in school, my mom always said, don't pay attention to them, and they'll stop.

939
01:00:31,347 --> 01:00:33,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And to a certain extent, she was kind of right.

940
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:37,831
[SPEAKER_06]: The more you pay attention to these types of things, they go away because they're there to ruffle feathers.

941
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:39,092
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they do.

942
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,234
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely get a point there.

943
01:00:42,755 --> 01:00:43,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

944
01:00:43,675 --> 01:00:45,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, we appreciate the call.

945
01:00:45,616 --> 01:00:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any last quick thoughts before we jump to another call?

946
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:50,542
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that pretty much covers it.

947
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking my call.

948
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:53,604
[SPEAKER_06]: No problemo.

949
01:00:53,724 --> 01:00:54,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night.

950
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:55,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, you too.

951
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:58,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I like hearing from people we don't hear from too often.

952
01:00:58,507 --> 01:00:59,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks for calling.

953
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:00,107
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

954
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:01,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we appreciate that.

955
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:02,129
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

956
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:03,549
[SPEAKER_06]: More calls.

957
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:04,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the phone's ringing off the hook.

958
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:05,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

959
01:01:05,951 --> 01:01:06,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

960
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:08,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

961
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I noticed a comment you just made in chat.

962
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:11,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Bullshit.

963
01:01:11,454 --> 01:01:13,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you do ignore bullies, they will keep at it.

964
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,038
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what my problem was.

965
01:01:17,078 --> 01:01:18,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I got bullied in school.

966
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I ignored them.

967
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:23,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It kept going to the point where I actually had to throw my fists up and get into a few fistfights.

968
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:26,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

969
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:32,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize that times have also changed from when I was a kid.

970
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

971
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:38,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I always kind of think a lot of people do things for attention.

972
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously there's extremes in every circumstance where people are just fucked in the head.

973
01:01:43,224 --> 01:01:45,146
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of times people do things for attention.

974
01:01:45,186 --> 01:01:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't give them attention, it'll go away.

975
01:01:47,828 --> 01:01:49,510
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are people that...

976
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:51,588
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

977
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:12,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Kart

978
01:02:37,415 --> 01:02:38,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this is the best Mario Kart yet?

979
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:40,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think it's somewhere in the middle?

980
01:02:41,518 --> 01:02:45,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somewhere in the middle because I really dig Mario Kart DS more.

981
01:02:46,682 --> 01:02:50,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's that, you know how they said they removed snaking and so forth?

982
01:02:50,764 --> 01:02:52,606
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it right, you can still do it.

983
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:59,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I just find it easier to do quote-unquote snaking and power boosting with the control stick than I could with the control pad.

984
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:06,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's interesting though is I find online people, like, it doesn't seem like people are cheating as much because you have a lot of people on there, you know, that don't,

985
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:10,197
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a lot of people on there that are playing with the wheel, for one.

986
01:03:10,217 --> 01:03:10,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that.

987
01:03:10,698 --> 01:03:11,979
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons of people online playing with the wheel.

988
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:12,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of people on the wheel.

989
01:03:13,399 --> 01:03:17,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it just seems like there's less cheating going on.

990
01:03:17,342 --> 01:03:22,125
[SPEAKER_06]: The only cheating in the game, and something I really should have mentioned in Part A when I reviewed the game, here's the irritation I have with the game.

991
01:03:22,946 --> 01:03:25,327
[SPEAKER_06]: The items, I realize it's a part of Mario Kart.

992
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:25,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be there.

993
01:03:25,988 --> 01:03:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little much.

994
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,070
[SPEAKER_06]: They really needed to scale back.

995
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:32,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think part of that might have to do with them expanding it from like 8 to 12 cars at once.

996
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:36,095
[SPEAKER_06]: There is just too many freaking blue shells that show up.

997
01:03:36,155 --> 01:03:36,595
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

998
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:38,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

999
01:03:38,477 --> 01:03:38,877
[SPEAKER_03]: A little much.

1000
01:03:39,077 --> 01:03:41,199
[SPEAKER_06]: You ought to be able to turn some of that shit off when playing online.

1001
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet, no.

1002
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you turn item off?

1003
01:03:44,742 --> 01:03:45,683
[SPEAKER_06]: You can turn items off.

1004
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:46,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1005
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all together, but you can't single one out.

1006
01:03:48,565 --> 01:03:51,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be nice if they gave you a little more customization where you can just turn off blue shells.

1007
01:03:51,748 --> 01:04:01,696
[SPEAKER_04]: They have it where you can do, like, you know, that the powerful items will appear less, will appear more, will appear normal, but to be honest, playing through each different mode, I have not noticed a difference.

1008
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:02,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1009
01:04:04,827 --> 01:04:14,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have noticed that when you're in first place with prior Mario Kart games, all you had at your disposal were banana peels and green turtle shells.

1010
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed now you're getting more powerful items like red turtle shells and other items, too.

1011
01:04:20,472 --> 01:04:26,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Once in a blue moon, you get a red turtle shell, but you never get a bullet, and you never get a blue shell, obviously.

1012
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten a lot of red shells being in first place, but I've also noticed that when I'm in first place...

1013
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,860
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1014
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:07,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love how they brought back the original power boosters and not a remix theme, the original themes.

1015
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really enjoying that.

1016
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:14,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like they've still been slightly retouched, but it's still, it's quality.

1017
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:16,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, you know, they didn't ruin them.

1018
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Sky, before I go, let me ask you to see if you agree with me.

1019
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:29,495
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Wiimote and Nunchuck controller, do you think it should have been more natural to use the Wiimote when you shake it to throw an item instead of doing tricks?

1020
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:33,914
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I think it might be too sensitive.

1021
01:05:34,074 --> 01:05:38,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes, you know, you get a little excited, you kind of move around, you hop around, especially if you're getting in the heat of it.

1022
01:05:38,618 --> 01:05:42,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a bad feeling that it would, and I sit kind of far away from the TV.

1023
01:05:42,462 --> 01:05:47,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I'm playing, the sensitivity is kind of, or, you know, if I'm trying to like point at the screen, it's really hard.

1024
01:05:47,427 --> 01:05:48,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to lean forward to get at the screen.

1025
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:51,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a bad feeling it would screw things up.

1026
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:54,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll meet you halfway.

1027
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:58,822
[SPEAKER_03]: They ought to add custom controls where you can assign whatever you want.

1028
01:06:16,249 --> 01:06:19,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much my return to the West Coast like you wanted me to.

1029
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:23,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my return to the West Coast like everybody wanted me to.

1030
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:46,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I do know I am crashing on DarkSakura's couch for three days, which will be pretty awesome.

1031
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be bringing some stuff.

1032
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:50,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll probably bring some New York City trinkets as well.

1033
01:06:51,122 --> 01:06:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Fourth of July weekend?

1034
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1035
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it wasn't summer, I'd say let's have a late birthday party for me at Roseville Golf Land, but it's summer and that's going to suck.

1036
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:03,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we could kind of make an agreement on my birthday's past, too.

1037
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:05,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could do something like that together.

1038
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:06,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll figure something out.

1039
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:07,980
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll talk more about it offline.

1040
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,920
[SPEAKER_06]: The listeners don't want to hear about it.

1041
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:09,841
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, take care, buddy.

1042
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:10,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

1043
01:07:11,062 --> 01:07:11,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1044
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:11,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1045
01:07:12,163 --> 01:07:15,246
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're in Northern California, specifically the Sacramento area...

1046
01:07:16,226 --> 01:07:19,127
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want to stay tuned the next few episodes because we're going to do something.

1047
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have some listeners in the stack area.

1048
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:23,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, quickly, any other last-minute stories?

1049
01:07:23,448 --> 01:07:24,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1050
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:25,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1051
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:35,651
[SPEAKER_04]: The ESRB has added some more Xbox Live Arcade games to their list of stuff coming out, including Samurai Shodown 2.

1052
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:41,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Red Baron for the arcade.

1053
01:07:42,073 --> 01:07:42,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Baron Arcade.

1054
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:48,566
[SPEAKER_04]: The Revenge of the Plague Lord

1055
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:23,121
[SPEAKER_04]: including Indestructible which is the cover track for that and Inside the Fire.

1056
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:26,102
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of interesting.

1057
01:08:27,323 --> 01:08:29,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let's see here.

1058
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:44,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 3 this week will be getting three songs from Muse, including Exo-Politics, Supermassive, Black Hole, and Stockholm Syndrome.

1059
01:08:45,106 --> 01:08:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to cost 500 Microsoft points.

1060
01:08:49,888 --> 01:09:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: and one other thing we talked a little bit about earlier with the virtual console and people hacking it now they've already hacked and pirated WiiWare games and they have actually brought over some of the Japanese WiiWare games to the North American virtual console you can actually find those online if you're into that kind of thing but I just think it's funny how quickly they've hacked those apart already and

1061
01:09:21,516 --> 01:09:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much it.

1062
01:09:24,657 --> 01:09:33,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and a rumor of a Blu-ray console coming to the market for, or a Blu-ray included 360 coming to the market in third quarter, although I don't believe that, but we'll see.

1063
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:38,140
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was listening to Bobby's show a little bit and he made a pretty good argument for why it is happening.

1064
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus, I think what I said earlier about the whole domino effect, I think it's damn well possible something like that's going to happen.

1065
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:45,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of time.

1066
01:09:45,302 --> 01:09:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just going to be hard with, you know, alienating their customers, but if they only use it for video playback, then that's fine.

1067
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:55,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as long as they don't start coming out with Blu-ray games, I absolutely agree with you there.

1068
01:09:56,811 --> 01:09:57,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely agree with you there.

1069
01:09:57,952 --> 01:09:58,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

1070
01:09:58,812 --> 01:09:59,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1071
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:00,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1072
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:04,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, DarkDeadSuya, what is on your mind, my friend?

1073
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:12,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, we were letting Loki do some last-minute stories for a little bit before we opened it back up.

1074
01:10:12,763 --> 01:10:13,224
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1075
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:14,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1076
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:18,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sure.

1077
01:10:18,869 --> 01:10:19,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, huh?

1078
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:20,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here.

1079
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:21,230
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1080
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,591
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have to lower the speakers in your house because you're probably hearing feedback.

1081
01:10:25,751 --> 01:10:27,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, sorry.

1082
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:27,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

1083
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:28,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it.

1084
01:10:30,252 --> 01:10:33,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Ranma has a little Archon, but I had...

1085
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,801
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR Central in October

1086
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Misty Dark Tetsuya OLR Central or whatever they're calling it happening in October.

1087
01:10:54,143 --> 01:10:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: None of which I've heard of, so it's awesome.

1088
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:58,506
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think they've talked about the October thing before.

1089
01:10:59,127 --> 01:10:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the deal, buddy.

1090
01:11:00,468 --> 01:11:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make time.

1091
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:03,229
[SPEAKER_06]: The year is a long time.

1092
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely we want to meet Misty.

1093
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely we want to entertain Ranma while he's here.

1094
01:11:07,933 --> 01:11:08,373
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1095
01:11:09,113 --> 01:11:12,035
[SPEAKER_06]: If other strangers from the internet want to fly out here, why not?

1096
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:12,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on over.

1097
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:13,576
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a party.

1098
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,604
[SPEAKER_06]: My roommate's probably going to kill me for saying that.

1099
01:11:18,784 --> 01:11:19,666
[SPEAKER_06]: He loves that idea.

1100
01:11:20,226 --> 01:11:21,728
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, whatever.

1101
01:11:21,769 --> 01:11:23,231
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make time for it all.

1102
01:11:23,371 --> 01:11:24,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not worried about it.

1103
01:11:24,332 --> 01:11:27,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And then somebody's going to say, let's do OLR Expo in August.

1104
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:30,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I was thinking about that portable Famicom thing.

1105
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:31,753
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounded pretty cool.

1106
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:55,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1107
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:59,793
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too bad, $40 or $50 considering it's portable and everything.

1108
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:01,013
[SPEAKER_06]: What an awesome piece of retro.

1109
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:05,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to ask Jamie if she's going to pick up one of those.

1110
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:07,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it just plays Nintendo games.

1111
01:12:08,621 --> 01:12:08,981
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

1112
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:10,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't play any of the other stuff.

1113
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:13,623
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, when I was thinking, well, where would you actually be able to get Nintendo games?

1114
01:12:13,643 --> 01:12:15,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, everybody stopped carrying them a long time ago.

1115
01:12:15,804 --> 01:12:17,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Flea markets and garage sales.

1116
01:12:17,385 --> 01:12:19,465
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pick shit up for like 50 cents a month.

1117
01:12:19,906 --> 01:12:24,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Game craze, or not game crazies, but playing trades, I think, still carry Nintendo.

1118
01:12:24,547 --> 01:12:27,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, like there's one of those stores in the Sacramento region.

1119
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,469
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to think bigger, big stores.

1120
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:30,830
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a chain.

1121
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,771
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like 300 stores in the U.S.

1122
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:34,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was only one of them here.

1123
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:35,331
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1124
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:35,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, funny.

1125
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:36,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, my bad.

1126
01:12:38,466 --> 01:12:43,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also, well, locally we've got our record store, Dimple.

1127
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,528
[SPEAKER_04]: They carry NES games.

1128
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I was in New York City for a new NYOLR con, when I was there last year, we actually all went to a video game store and they had old Nintendo games.

1129
01:12:56,032 --> 01:12:59,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember because I found a copy of The Guardian Legend, which I bought for my friend.

1130
01:12:59,993 --> 01:13:01,875
[SPEAKER_06]: who let me stay at her place in New York City.

1131
01:13:01,895 --> 01:13:06,899
[SPEAKER_06]: She lives in Brooklyn and she has an old school Nintendo and I bought it for her and I said, Amanda, that's her name, Amanda.

1132
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, Amanda, this is the best video game of all time.

1133
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,423
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to treasure this game.

1134
01:13:11,564 --> 01:13:12,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the bitch has played it yet.

1135
01:13:14,326 --> 01:13:15,407
[SPEAKER_09]: She's too busy with WoW.

1136
01:13:16,488 --> 01:13:19,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Irene, I know Irene called her and was like, Amanda, Kara's there.

1137
01:13:20,211 --> 01:13:20,792
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, yep.

1138
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:22,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I don't think Irene's ever talked to her.

1139
01:13:22,393 --> 01:13:22,734
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

1140
01:13:23,885 --> 01:13:26,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Video Games New York was the name of the store, according to Ranma.

1141
01:13:27,806 --> 01:13:30,607
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, DT, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

1142
01:13:32,187 --> 01:13:34,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, I just hope Grady 2 comes out in the U.S.

1143
01:13:35,288 --> 01:13:35,488
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1144
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:36,569
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 comes out in the U.S.?

1145
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:37,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Grady 2.

1146
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:39,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I hope so, too.

1147
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:40,050
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1148
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:43,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the odds of seeing that are much more than Cho and Iki here in the U.S.

1149
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:44,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, yeah.

1150
01:13:46,431 --> 01:13:47,872
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, DT, take care.

1151
01:13:47,912 --> 01:13:48,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good week, okay?

1152
01:13:48,672 --> 01:13:49,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see you in October.

1153
01:13:49,532 --> 01:13:50,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you too.

1154
01:13:50,272 --> 01:13:50,593
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1155
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:51,553
[SPEAKER_06]: See you later.

1156
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:51,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1157
01:13:52,423 --> 01:13:52,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1158
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:18,146
[SPEAKER_06]: RicePrincess

1159
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:36,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, oh, you should hang it, too.

1160
01:14:36,103 --> 01:14:36,483
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting it.

1161
01:14:36,503 --> 01:14:37,983
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to hang the question mark block from the ceiling.

1162
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:44,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put Tack and hang the question mark block, and then we'll put the mushrooms around, and we can put, like, Cartman and some of these other things they see on Justin.TV on the mushrooms.

1163
01:14:44,886 --> 01:14:51,209
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we have to fix Justin.TV by actually wiring the Mac in, because the feed on Justin.TV sucks right now, so we've got to fix that.

1164
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:57,772
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, speaking of Justin.TV, real quick, did you hear about some of our friends over on Justin.TV got their stream shut down?

1165
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,292
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1166
01:14:58,312 --> 01:15:00,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Take two, put the smack down, just for a day.

1167
01:15:00,293 --> 01:15:01,453
[SPEAKER_06]: They only got a 24-hour ban.

1168
01:15:01,473 --> 01:15:03,114
[SPEAKER_06]: They got some archives deleted, but apparently...

1169
01:15:03,414 --> 01:15:03,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Music

1170
01:15:26,918 --> 01:15:27,959
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to hide our footage.

1171
01:15:27,979 --> 01:15:28,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Our footage is still there.

1172
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:29,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to hide it.

1173
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,541
[SPEAKER_06]: But we only did like 10 minutes.

1174
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:36,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they had shut us down for 10, I would have thrown a fit because IGN and these other sites probably have way more than 10 minutes worth of video.

1175
01:15:36,985 --> 01:15:38,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all on YouTube now too.

1176
01:15:38,486 --> 01:15:39,166
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

1177
01:15:39,246 --> 01:15:39,867
[SPEAKER_04]: It's retarded.

1178
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:43,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Although Shadow Next Gen in chat says a bunch of YouTube videos were deleted too.

1179
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:44,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just stupid.

1180
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Free publicity for your game.

1181
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:47,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, they're just bullies.

1182
01:15:48,472 --> 01:15:50,014
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I would say we should boycott them.

1183
01:15:50,034 --> 01:15:51,735
[SPEAKER_06]: We should ignore them, Rob.

1184
01:15:51,775 --> 01:15:53,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's stop talking about it right now.

1185
01:15:53,536 --> 01:15:54,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's fine.

1186
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:56,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll boycott their other smaller games.

1187
01:15:56,178 --> 01:15:56,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Good idea.

1188
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they've got the 2K series.

1189
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't like sports, so that's fine.

1190
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:04,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got their stupid, what, tennis game.

1191
01:16:04,885 --> 01:16:06,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Their Rockstar's Table Tennis.

1192
01:16:06,786 --> 01:16:08,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck your table tennis in the ass.

1193
01:16:08,387 --> 01:16:09,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't playing that shit.

1194
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:11,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they've got...

1195
01:16:12,563 --> 01:16:14,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've got Dora the Explorer, which is shit.

1196
01:16:16,524 --> 01:16:26,186
[SPEAKER_04]: They've also got Mafia, which is coming out, and Noir, but when the fuck are those going to come out forever from now?

1197
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:28,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1198
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:31,187
[SPEAKER_04]: All I buy is Grand Theft Auto.

1199
01:16:32,128 --> 01:16:34,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Any final thoughts from you, Rice Princess?

1200
01:16:34,308 --> 01:16:38,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here tonight and giving us a female perspective when DarkSakura was unable to.

1201
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,956
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1202
01:16:40,056 --> 01:16:40,356
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1203
01:16:40,436 --> 01:16:41,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Any final thoughts?

1204
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:43,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get myself a banana.

1205
01:16:45,023 --> 01:16:45,824
[SPEAKER_09]: No one gets that.

1206
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:46,465
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1207
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:51,812
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is actually a fruit salad sounds pretty yummy right now.

1208
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:53,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Yummy, yummy.

1209
01:16:53,395 --> 01:16:54,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1210
01:16:54,336 --> 01:16:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get that.

1211
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:57,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

1212
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:01,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if you like what you hear here on Orange Lounge Radio, please tell two friends about our show.

1213
01:17:01,745 --> 01:17:02,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell two enemies about our show.

1214
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:03,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1215
01:17:03,187 --> 01:17:09,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tell two people about our show because that's how word of mouth spreads and more people everywhere find out about Orange Lounge Radio.

1216
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:14,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And without you and your support, independent radio would be dead.

1217
01:17:14,761 --> 01:17:15,862
[SPEAKER_06]: But thanks to you, it's still alive.

1218
01:17:16,062 --> 01:17:19,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I heard that because I was giving out our cards during the Zappos.

1219
01:17:19,203 --> 01:17:23,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like just about to play the outgoing music, but what, what, Loki?

1220
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I was handing out our cards at the Zappos thing, and they're going to put it on their little blog site.

1221
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:27,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1222
01:17:28,107 --> 01:17:28,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1223
01:17:28,668 --> 01:17:29,208
[SPEAKER_04]: How nice of them.

1224
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:30,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1225
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:31,029
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, cool.

1226
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:33,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting out there a little more.

1227
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo-hoo!

1228
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:36,746
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

1229
01:17:36,766 --> 01:17:38,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.

1230
01:17:38,908 --> 01:17:41,271
[SPEAKER_06]: She's not DarkSakura, but she will be next week.

1231
01:17:41,671 --> 01:17:43,934
[SPEAKER_06]: He's Loki, and RicePrincess helped.

1232
01:17:44,114 --> 01:17:45,195
[SPEAKER_06]: We're Orange Lounge Radio.

1233
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good week.

1234
01:17:46,476 --> 01:17:49,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1235
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:52,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1236
01:17:53,444 --> 01:18:02,072
[SPEAKER_02]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

1237
01:18:02,573 --> 01:18:14,143
[SPEAKER_02]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

1238
01:18:14,764 --> 01:18:15,585
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!
