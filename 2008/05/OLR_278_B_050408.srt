00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:15,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,900
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,500
But you're probably thinking to yourself, but hey, Rob, it's about 7.30 in the evening Pacific or 10.30 Eastern.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:43,000
That's because it's time for part B of our podcast, which goes out to the podcast feed usually on Wednesdays, Thursdays if I'm having an especially busy week like last week.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So sorry about that.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Also this week, a bonus podcast, just a very, very short 10 minute little podcast will go out to the feed probably midweek,

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,500
probably before you hear this part B podcast listeners that actually will have the Grand Theft Auto finalists in it.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:10,900
You know, we had that contest going on that ultimately rolls up into the All Games competition where we are actually going to be giving away a Grand Theft Auto for limited edition one and eight custom console Xbox 360 Elite.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,900
It's going to be awesome.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,700
And I played for you guys entry from an ineligible listener in part A.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,900
So if you haven't heard part A yet, go back and listen.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,400
For those of you listening live tonight on All Games Radio, you have about four hours left to get an entry in.

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
I'll tell you what, there's not a lot of competition.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,700
So if you think you can come up with something creative pretty quick, do it.

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,400
You might win an Xbox 360 Elite.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
It's going to be pretty awesome.

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,800
We'll let you know who is the finalist for Orange Lounge Radio next week.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:41,300
And I think we'll know in like two, two and a half weeks who the ultimate winner is from AllGames.com, who's walking away with the one and eight Xbox 360 Elite.

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Don't forget, just for being the Orange Lounge Radio finalist, you do get some prizes.

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,700
You get like a T-shirt and $25 gift certificate to the new All Games store that's up and running.

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,400
That's awesome.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Awesome.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,500
All right, just for being silly and recording it for our mutual enjoyment.

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,300
All right, let's get back into some gaming news here on part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,200
Loki, take it away.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
All right, let's see here.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,900
Well, this is kind of interesting because I know they haven't been doing too well for the longest time.

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:18,000
But Atari is actually being bought up by Infogrames for $11 million.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,700
And the announced, I guess, merger, they're going to buy the remaining stock of Atari, of course, for $11 million.

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,200
And that will immediately lend $20 million to the company before the deal closes.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:43,400
And although it's hard to really say what's going to happen, although Infogrames only had 51.4 controlling interest in Atari, or 51.4%.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,000
It looks like it doesn't really sound like what kind of changes are going to happen after this.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,500
But I guess it's nice for Atari to have a little bit more financial backing.

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, here's the thing, though.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Essentially, Atari has been sold for $11 million.

38
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,700
Is that what I'm going to understand?

39
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah.

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,600
I mean, $11 million is not that much money.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,700
I mean, don't get me wrong.

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,000
I'd gladly take $11 million.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Our company that I work for could have bought Atari.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,700
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,300
I'm like, dude, this is the company that is like my childhood.

46
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,400
You know, when I mean like little childhood, like when I was like three, was when the Atari 2600 was big.

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
But still, it's kind of weird to think that...

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Why hasn't EA bought them?

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,400
I mean, they could have just like, seriously, it's just why I boof, snapped them up like nothing.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:36,100
I mean, I know that they may not be interested in per se them, but a bigger portfolio is not a bad thing.

51
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,700
I mean, granted, it sounds like there's some other stuff involved here.

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,900
Like the whole, like they're loaning them $20 million and stuff.

53
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,300
So maybe it's not fair to say they're only getting sold for $11 million.

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,700
But still, that's kind of what it comes off as.

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,200
It's just kind of weird.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,600
It'd be like if someone sold Nintendo 20 years from now for like, I don't know, $15, $20 million.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
A bag of peanuts.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,400
I mean, that would be like, it would be weird.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Of course, it was also weird to see the Sega logo on a Nintendo game like years ago when F-Zero came out.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,500
It's all weird.

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,900
That is weird.

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,500
Sephiroth1215 in our chat room.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,300
Chat.orangelauncherader.com says,

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,200
Too bad most Atari or Infogrames games suck.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,500
The Dragon Ball Z games are good, but I'm really sick of them now because they just do the same thing every year.

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,800
I mean, I guess that is the sad thing.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,300
Atari honestly hasn't had a lot going for it recently.

68
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,500
See, that would have been perfect.

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,700
You could have had Dragon Ball Z 2008 or 2009 for EA.

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Although I have to admit, I did kind of want one of those flashback consoles.

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,100
I mean, it's not like I can't still get one, but you know, flashback consoles are cool.

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,600
So, I guess there you have it.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,800
More to develop on that or more news on that, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, including what the joint projects will be in the future.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's talk about Qmotions.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,100
They are a subsidiary of Actiga.

76
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
They're a gaming company.

77
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,400
They apparently have made some sort of agreement with Microsoft.

78
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:03,800
They're going to be using the wireless technology that Qmotions has for types of active gaming controllers for the Xbox 360.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, Qmotions has made these large controllers for like golf, baseball, and snowboarding.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,500
I want to say, I've seen this before.

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,700
I want to say one of those times...

82
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,600
They sell them at Best Buy, I think.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,200
I want to say one of those times we were on All Games Interactive, like, last year or a couple of years ago.

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,700
Like, they had one of these in the house.

85
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,400
Like, they had just acquired one there.

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,100
Like, I wonder if...

87
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,000
I think that was the same thing.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
So, they know how to make these types of controllers.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,900
Well, apparently, Microsoft is getting in on this now for who knows what type of project.

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,800
But it kind of makes sense, you know, with the Wii doing as well as it is.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,500
Microsoft wants a piece of it somehow, so they'll buy somebody else to do it.

92
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,800
Make an agreement to do it.

93
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,100
The press release stated that the first controller that will be coming out will be a big Air wireless controller.

94
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,500
It's a full-size skateboard that will work with skateboarding games.

95
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
I mean, this is pretty high-end stuff.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,700
This isn't something that, you know, a gamer that doesn't have a lot of money can pick up.

97
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,200
But still, I mean, if you really want to get immersed in your games, I guess this is the way to do it.

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,800
This is what they should be setting up at the Westin.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,700
I mean, this is the kind of thing you don't get to play every day.

100
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,100
There you have it.

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,800
What do you think, Loki?

102
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,300
Is this the type of thing you would be interested in at all?

103
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
No.

104
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Why not?

105
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't know.

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,300
It sounds like, as Alton Brown would put it, it's a uni-tasker.

107
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
And no one likes a uni-tasker.

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Wow.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,100
Nerd.

110
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,800
Only you would quote the Food Network here on our program.

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,100
Hey.

112
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,900
So there's a game coming out here pretty soon that I think a lot of people will be interested in.

113
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
On a rain-slick precipice of darkness, episode one.

114
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right, the Penny Arcade Adventures game.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Episode one has gone gold and is due out on PC later this quarter for $20.

116
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:04,200
Then I believe later on, also, they will be releasing it to Xbox Live for 1600 Microsoft points, also $20.

117
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,100
It will also make it the most expensive Xbox Live arcade game to date.

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah, but if you add up all the parts in Luminous, it's a little more expensive.

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,800
That is true, but still though, out of the gate though, this is the most expensive Xbox Live arcade game.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,100
And probably going to set a disturbing trend among games.

121
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,300
Hey, they're going to buy it for 20 bucks.

122
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,700
Let's put out our crappy game for $20.

123
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,700
I don't know, but you kind of sense that Penny Arcade's going to be able to get away with it.

124
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,800
I mean, it's all about if the game is good, but at least the IP is good.

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,500
Yeah, I mean, if it's a full game, I mean, that'll be awesome.

126
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,300
But I just have a bad feeling though that other companies are going to look at this and go,

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,000
hey, you know what, we can get our game to be $20 too, and they'll sell it and it'll be shit.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Well, if some little internet comic can get $20 for their game,

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,000
then we ought to be able to sell our game for $20.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,700
You do that too well, Rob.

131
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,300
I've been snooping in on boardrooms.

132
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,200
So, um...

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,500
How about Macintosh?

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,100
Who cares? I'm just kidding.

135
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,200
The chat room's asking.

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,100
Oh, no love, I guess.

137
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,300
So, do we know anything about the actual game?

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,800
There's screenshots and stuff out there. I haven't done a lot of research on the game.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,300
I'm sorry, it is gone gold for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

140
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,500
Well, there you have it.

141
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Awesome.

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,800
So you can't say you don't have anything to play on the Mac.

143
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,300
I don't know a lot about this game. Isn't it kind of like an adventure-type game?

144
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,000
It's like an adventure game.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,300
Kind of think of like a cross between one of the LucasArts adventure games and Final Fantasy.

146
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:46,400
So you've got the turn-based fighting in there as well, and it's all the Penny Arcade humor.

147
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,900
I don't know.

148
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Interesting.

149
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
It looks really cool.

150
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Alright. Well, Rockband has made some progress, a lot of progress.

151
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,900
This game, of course, just on about every console out there, except the Wii right now.

152
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,900
It's out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, right?

153
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Don't they have a version of this on PS2?

154
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Yes.

155
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Well, it's out there everywhere.

156
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,900
They've announced that they have sold 3 million copies of the game.

157
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,900
10 million Rockband songs have been downloaded.

158
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,900
4 million of those since March 20th, just about 6 weeks ago.

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Damn.

160
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
So, yeah, 3 million copies of the game, 10 million.

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,900
That means, on the average, people are buying 3 or 4 songs a pop.

162
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
And how much do each song cost?

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,900
About 2 bucks, depending on what platform and what song.

164
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
So, on average, about...

165
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,900
I'm wondering if they're counting those albums as 12 songs sold, though, but I guess they can.

166
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
I mean, because they charge more for those, so...

167
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
But, and how many people really bought that album?

168
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm sure there's plenty. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the artist, but...

169
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
I bought a lot of songs on there.

170
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
I bought quite a few, too, I gotta admit.

171
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
I don't know why I buy them, because I have them in...

172
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,900
I don't either, but it's the ultimate party game, because, like, you're glad to have them when people are over.

173
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,900
You guys are so funny. Like, I don't know why I buy them, but I bought them.

174
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Just, I have those Microsoft points burning a hole in my pocket.

175
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
I'm telling you, that's why that stuff is evil.

176
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,900
Because Microsoft, it's so easy to just press that one little button and, doop, spend Microsoft points.

177
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Or add more.

178
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
If you need to reload, doop, just add more points.

179
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
It's dangerous.

180
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
You're not spending money, you're just spending points.

181
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Exactly. I don't notice it until I look at my bank statement and I go,

182
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Son of a bitch, I just bought, like, 40 bucks worth of Microsoft points this month.

183
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
What do I have to speak for it?

184
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I bought JIRUS.

185
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
That's pretty smart, though, that they...

186
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
It is.

187
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Scary.

188
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Oh.

189
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
What?

190
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,900
We're going on the tangent train, unfortunately.

191
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Oh, dear God. Alright, what's up?

192
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm sorry, you know, because you know me, I'm looking up last minute stories and stuff.

193
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Sure, sure.

194
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,900
And I had to mention this because it just, poof, they had a big little thing in the corner of the screen here.

195
00:10:44,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Apparently, at Maker Faire 2008 today, MacGyver creator and Lee David Zlotov announced that he is making a big budget MacGyver movie.

196
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Fuck yeah.

197
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Yeah, but they're bastardizing everything we left in the 80s.

198
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Yeah, whatever, who cares.

199
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
18 movie coming out, too. I mean...

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Why didn't they make these movies when they were popular? I don't understand. When MacGyver was still on the air.

201
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,900
It's the whole retro thing. It's just like a few years ago, 70s retro. Like, they remade Charlie's Angels, they remade the Brady Bunch, right?

202
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Now the 80s are coming. Dude, it's just a matter of time before we get the Facts of Life movie.

203
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
Who would they cast as Natalie in Tootie?

204
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
I don't know.

205
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
In Tootie.

206
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
I don't know, I just kind of think it's a no.

207
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Rumor is the movie will be made out of a shoelace.

208
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Shut up.

209
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Limbs and a jar of peanut butter.

210
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Can you take us back to video games, please?

211
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Sorry. Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting news coming out with, what is it, Guitar Hero.

212
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Apparently Aerosmith, of course, you know, there's the Aerosmith Guitar Hero game coming out soon.

213
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:09,900
They are locked into an exclusive contract with Guitar Hero and unfortunately no download content will be coming out for Rock Band featuring Aerosmith.

214
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Now I'm not sure if this is going to be forever. I'm assuming it's just for a matter, you know, a length of time, but I mean, God, who cares?

215
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,900
It meaning there's an escape clause in it should Guitar Hero tank in the near future so Aerosmith can get in on the other game.

216
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Yeah.

217
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
It's got to be that.

218
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:36,900
It says apparently excluding, I guess, Rock Band's train kept on rolling, Aerosmith's entire catalog of Rock and Roll hits will be exclusive to Guitar Hero.

219
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:46,900
And it says Newsweek got confirmation that the Aerosmith publicist and Activision PR that the band's songs would be locked down for an unspecified period of time.

220
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,900
So that is for a limited amount of time.

221
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
Meaning there's an escape clause, just in case.

222
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Yeah. And you know what? I mean, it really would be for their best interest to get their song out there as many places as possible.

223
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:09,900
But, you know, hey, if they're going to throw a lot of money at you for, you know, a certain amount of time of, you know, exclusivity, I guess, more power to them, I guess.

224
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Alright. Well, you know, I don't know. I have a real problem with this kind of stuff because I see this as the beginning, it's the little pebble that starts the snowball that starts the avalanche.

225
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:29,900
Because we all know, you know, we heard last week Guitar Hero 4 is supposedly following in Rock Band's footsteps where they're going to be adding voice, they're going to be adding drums, possibly.

226
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,900
I mean, a lot of it's speculation. You know, we know there's one. But the thing is, will both play nice?

227
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,900
Or am I going to have to have two of everything, like Noah's frickin' Ark in my gaming closet?

228
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,900
If it's up to Activision, if it's up to Activision, then no they won't. But, if it's up to Microsoft, then yes they will.

229
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,900
And remember, Microsoft, they have strict regulations about their accessories and peripherals that they all have to play nice with each other.

230
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Well, you know what? That shit pisses me off if they don't play nice. And when I get pissed off, we do the FUs of the week.

231
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:16,900
LOKI, why don't you start us off tonight, since Dark Sakura is not here?

232
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:24,900
FUs to Gravity for pulling the mustard out of my sandwich and staining my shirt and my shorts with delicious mustard.

233
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Rice Princess, since you're filling in tonight, would you care to give an FU for anything?

234
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,900
FU to Hollywood After Dark for showing Rue McClanahan stripping.

235
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Do we need to describe Bad Movie Night really quick?

236
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Yeah, do it, do it.

237
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Give him a rundown of Bad Movie Night. You haven't talked at all tonight.

238
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
No, Matt should do it.

239
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Alright, man.

240
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Okay, Bad Movie Night is where we pick bad movies, bad but entertaining movies to watch.

241
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Sadly, none of my movies got picked. I brought Follow That Bird, the Sesame Street adaptation from 1980s, but my choice was not screened last night.

242
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,900
It wasn't bad enough, I guess. It wasn't that bad of a movie. It was just a classic.

243
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,900
We're all pushing 30. It's pretty bad in retrospect.

244
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:13,900
No, no, no. Okay, we watched Sleepaway Camp, which I've seen numerous times, but there were a few people that hadn't seen it yet, so that's funny.

245
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,900
I swear to God, I'll ban you from chat if you ruin the twist ending to Sleepaway Camp.

246
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Yeah, do not do it.

247
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Best twist ending ever in a movie, Sleepaway Camp.

248
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
And if you haven't seen it, watch it immediately.

249
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,900
You need to watch it, and I swear to God, strap yourself through the chair and force yourself to watch it. The twist ending is worth it.

250
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah, just get through it.

251
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,900
And you gotta love the line where the guy goes, I gotta take a wicked dump.

252
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
That's awesome.

253
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
I love Sleepaway Camp. That's the ultimate bad movie.

254
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Then we watched this other movie, which, what was it? It was like something ninjas?

255
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
We watched it fast-forward, Karate Kidz.

256
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Karate Kidz USA, I think is what it was called. Oh my God, it was horrible.

257
00:15:52,900 --> 00:16:04,900
We fast-forwarded through most of that, but there was a part where the kid called this black biker a souffle, which I don't know how that's an insult, but whatever, and he's all, no one calls me a souffle, I'll see you later.

258
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Like, what? And they basically have the battle, like, hillbillies in the forest or something.

259
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Alright, so tell us about the Rue McClanahan movie.

260
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
So the Rue McClanahan movie, that was Hollywood After Dark.

261
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,900
By the way, she was Blanche on the Golden Girls, just in case you didn't know.

262
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:26,900
It was Hollywood After Dark. It's actually, the film was a part of this, what do they call it, the film crew.

263
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:35,900
It's the guys that did Mystery Science the year 3000, but now it's essentially the same damn thing, which is without the robots, and now they can swear and stuff during that.

264
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:44,900
It was pretty funny, but she was playing the stripper, and they made her strip, and it was, some of the comments they made there were really funny.

265
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,900
And then there was these weird chicks that they had stripping. There was no nudity in this movie whatsoever.

266
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
It was made in the 60s, so it was still taboo.

267
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
They had pasties with sparset.

268
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,900
But they had some really ugly people just stripping, I guess.

269
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,900
And the stripping just went on and on.

270
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,900
I know, that's what was making me bored. I'm like, oh my god, there's only so many funny things you can say about a woman stripping, but it keeps...

271
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Like, doesn't Mystery Science Theater usually cut down the movies a little bit?

272
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
No.

273
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Really? I thought they always cut it down for broadcast. Oh well.

274
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Anyhow, funny stuff. I was thinking, we should do a Justin.TV thing where we make fun of movies.

275
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
That'd be great.

276
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
Jamie would love that too, she loves bad movies.

277
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,900
You can go to the film crew's website, and they have podcasts that are meant for different movies, and you can play them at the same time as you're watching them.

278
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Like newer movies?

279
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Newer movies, yeah.

280
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Nice.

281
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,900
And so, I mean, I highly, after watching this, because this seriously was, it's the same Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality.

282
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
I mean, absolutely, without a doubt.

283
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,900
I mean, just nothing cut down whatsoever, no water down.

284
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,900
In fact, it was a little bit better, I think, because they were able to say stuff like, you know, make famous jokes and stuff like that.

285
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,900
But absolutely awesome. Check out the website.

286
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Alright, we got on a tangent.

287
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
The F.U. of the week goes to the fact that, well, this is actually a good thing.

288
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
It's been one month since I've been out of the hospital as of today for, you know, when I was in there for pancreatitis.

289
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
But the F.U. goes to the fact that I'm not sure it's completely gone.

290
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Like, I still get chest pains once in a while, and that's kind of irritating.

291
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
But I found that on Friday.

292
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
We'll see.

293
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
F.U. to blood tests.

294
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Especially when the nurse doesn't take, or the nurse gives you this really horrible tape that, I swear to God, I've tried to wash this off like five times this week, and the residue from the tape is still not coming off.

295
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Wow, that's gross.

296
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
I know, it just won't come off.

297
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Try alcohol.

298
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
That's what I'm gonna have to do.

299
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Horrible.

300
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Not the drinkable alcohol.

301
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
I know that.

302
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

303
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Talk about Fatal Inertia.

304
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Fatal Inertia, this is the interesting thing about it.

305
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,900
It was going to be coming out as a PlayStation 3 launch title.

306
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Then, apparently, it was gonna be on the Xbox 360.

307
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Now it's back on the PlayStation Network.

308
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
It came out for the 360.

309
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Did it?

310
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Yeah, it did, like, last September, I think.

311
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
As an arcade title?

312
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
No, as a full-blown title.

313
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
Oh, I thought this was an arcade title.

314
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,900
This game, I had high hopes on it, because originally when they were first showing up,

315
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,900
like, pre-PS3 launch, this game looked like it was gonna be just like F-Zero or something

316
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,900
like that, a combat racing game, but I played the demo of it, and the demo kinda sucked,

317
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,900
but I hear that the demo wasn't a really good representation of the game, but now they're

318
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
supposed to be making it better.

319
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Interesting.

320
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,900
The EX, Facial Inertia EX is coming out to the PlayStation Network.

321
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,900
See, that's what confuses me, because it was coming on PSN, whereas the other one was on

322
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
360, so I thought it was an arcade title.

323
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
Alright, I get it now.

324
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Well, I guess not a lot of people got it on the 360, because I didn't even know about

325
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
it, but here's the thing.

326
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,900
They're gonna be adding to it a brand new training mode, more tracks in the game, and

327
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
apparently the game is not as difficult.

328
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
They've actually lowered the difficulty a little bit.

329
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Well, the track, the thing I didn't like about the game was the track design was really

330
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
confusing.

331
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,900
It was hard to tell where you're supposed to go, and you get lost pretty easy.

332
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,900
$29.99 late May is when this game is coming out.

333
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Yeah, that's about the price I think the other one was, too.

334
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,900
I think it was $39.99 when it came out.

335
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
So, awesome.

336
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,900
So, Mega Man has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records Gamer's Edition.

337
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,900
I actually had a chance to check this out at a bookstore the other day.

338
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,900
I thought it was pretty well put together, but I still laugh at the fact that there's

339
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,900
gaming world records in there, and they're kind of retarded, but whatever.

340
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:27,900
But apparently there are 46 Mega Man games in existence, making it the largest, I guess,

341
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,900
franchise out there.

342
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,900
There are 17 games in the classic series, 11 Mega Man X games, 4 Mega Man Zero games,

343
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,900
2 Mega Man ZX games, 3 Mega Man Legend games, 6 Mega Man Battle Network games, and 3 Mega

344
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Man Star Force games.

345
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:51,900
And I know there's a lot more coming out as well.

346
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Lots of Mega Man.

347
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,900
You know, I was tempted, though.

348
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,900
The other day I saw the Mega Man Collection, which was a game I think I rented once.

349
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,900
It's great, because the old school Mega Man games are awesome, and they have the new one

350
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
that came out, well, it's not that new now, but it came out on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

351
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Well, you can play old GameCube games on your Wii, and that blockbuster we went to to get

352
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Sleepaway Camp the other day had the Mega Man Collection for sale for GameCube, but

353
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
previously played copy.

354
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
15 bucks.

355
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Nice.

356
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
I almost bought it.

357
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Well, so here's the thing.

358
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,900
So I'm thinking, like, why not buy that, and then, you know, because it's going to come

359
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
out on Virtual Console eventually.

360
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I thought it was 1999 when it first came out, so.

361
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Yeah, but still.

362
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
A few years ago.

363
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
15 is not bad.

364
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
It's cheap.

365
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
It's like six, seven Mega Man games.

366
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Eight, maybe.

367
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I don't remember how many were in there, but a lot.

368
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Well, only three of them are really even worth playing anyway.

369
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
That's true.

370
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
And that was the first three that were ever created, so.

371
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
All the rest of them.

372
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Hitstun says, don't get the GameCube one.

373
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Why not?

374
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I thought the GameCube one had the remixed music, which was cool.

375
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,900
There, I want to say that each version had, like, there was a PlayStation 2 and then there

376
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,900
was a GameCube one, and I think each one had, like, a different unlockable game in

377
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
there or something.

378
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Hmm.

379
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
All right, well, whatever.

380
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,180
I'm probably not actually going to get the game anyway, because, you know, Irene's going

381
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
to call me this week.

382
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
She's going to be like, dude, Rob, Karazhan.

383
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Rob, Karazhan.

384
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,900
I know, and I'm going to be like, oh, fuck Mega Man.

385
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,020
All right.

386
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,900
Let's read some mail.

387
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, if you'd like to send us some emails, we will read

388
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
them on air.

389
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,460
Dark Soccer's not here tonight, so I'm filling in, reading some email from our listeners,

390
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,740
and I got to say this, kids, you guys wrote a lot of emails this week, and so we can only

391
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,140
really read so many.

392
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,100
Dark Soccer's usually very nice, and she'll try to read them all.

393
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
I am not as nice.

394
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I apologize.

395
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
No, actually, I don't.

396
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,740
We've got a show to do here, and we want to get out of here at 4, you know, 11 o'clock,

397
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,860
so I'm going to pick some tonight.

398
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,300
Really quickly, ShadowCharlie sent us an email about this whole article.

399
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,220
He basically copy-pasted an article about the Mothers Against Drunk Driving Attacking

400
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,700
Grand Theft Auto 4.

401
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Retarded.

402
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
And why is that?

403
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,100
Well, let me give you the gist of what happened.

404
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,540
Basically, they're pissed because you can actually drive drunk in the game, and I believe

405
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,820
it's the objective of one of the missions in the game.

406
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,140
They're claiming Grand Theft Auto should be re-rated as adults only.

407
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,700
It's not, that's the spin that they were putting on it.

408
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,420
There is no, I mean, you can drive drunk in the game, but they tell you that, you know,

409
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,980
even when you, it's one of the dates, whatever, you go in there and you can drink and stuff,

410
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,580
and you can either try to drive home, which is pretty difficult, and the police will catch

411
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
you.

412
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,980
I mean, they'll see, notice that you're driving drunk if you do try, and it also suggests

413
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,460
right as you're coming out of the bar, it says, well, maybe you should take a cab, and

414
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,340
you can hail a cab, you know, to take you back home, but, you know.

415
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,260
Sensationalism around Grand Theft Auto 4?

416
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
I know, it's crazy.

417
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
Oh, surely you jest.

418
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,820
Yeah, I know, and people like, you know, claiming things that aren't actually in the game, yeah,

419
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
that's surprising.

420
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,820
See, that's so stupid, because you can do other shit in the games.

421
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,220
Yeah, murder okay, truck driving, whoa, that's taking it too far.

422
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,860
Excuse me, sir, you gotta change your rating.

423
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,180
Frisbee in chat is screaming, it's not real driving, it's not real drunk.

424
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,380
Yeah, it's all.

425
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,460
It is pretty cool the way it's done, though, like the whole camera shakes around and stuff,

426
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,220
and randomly your car will swerve in different directions, and you have to kind of, you know,

427
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,500
counter-steer for that, but I like it, I think it's pretty cool.

428
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,220
You know, you can ride animals while drunk in World of Warcraft, and no one says anything

429
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
about that.

430
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
That's true.

431
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,180
No one said anything about, was it Saints Row, you could get high and stoned and stuff

432
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,220
in that game, you can also get drunk and drive around and kill people, in fact, they kind

433
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,820
of insist that when you are drunk, you have superpowers and you can punch people really

434
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,660
far away, so I don't know, I don't know.

435
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Interesting.

436
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:40,060
Alright, moving on to the next email from GS68, hey OLR crew, specifically Loki and

437
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,060
Rob Rob Rob, I have a bad feeling about your appearance at Fonami, you're not listed under

438
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:49,060
the panel section of the Fonami2008 site at fonami.com, are you gonna try and make a last

439
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,060
minute arrangement or something, if there's no OLR panel this year, then I suppose us

440
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,220
Bay Area OLR fans will just have to find some other way to meet up at Fonami, less than

441
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,900
slash three GS68, this email brought to you by Hooters, home of the never-ending girl's

442
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,700
thoughts, god that Olive Garden thing has caught on, everybody's signing their emails

443
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,300
of strange things now, uh yeah, we're gonna have to break the news to you, we are not

444
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,460
attending Fonami this year, we do not plan on doing a live panel this year, it is nothing

445
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,820
against Fonami, we still love the staff and everything, the thing is that, you know, Jamie

446
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,500
has other plans this year, and quite frankly, we just kind of, you know, it's a three day

447
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,660
weekend, it's one of the few that us working kids have during the year, and so we just

448
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,040
want to take the weekend to kind of do other things, and also since we're gonna be hopefully

449
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,180
doing packs and some other shows later in the year, we've just decided to sit this one

450
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:39,020
out, sorry, is anybody going to Fonami just for fun, in curiosity, no, no, not that, you

451
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,060
always go, this is the first year you haven't been to Fonami in a long time, isn't it, no

452
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,900
it hasn't, I thought you went like every year, I used to like when I was in the anime, what

453
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:54,020
like five years ago, but you know, and even then, it was only really like three years

454
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,420
in a row. Well still, those of you guys that are going to Fonami, we hope you have a lot,

455
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,460
a lot of fun, and good luck. ASEN is being yelled in chat, and ASEN is too soon, ASEN

456
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,380
is very soon, the problem is, I was originally wanting to go to ASEN, but my medical things

457
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,460
came up and I had to put it aside, because you know, that kind of stuff is more important

458
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,660
for me right now, maybe next year, I'm really hoping. Packs is the most definite right now,

459
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,900
and you never know what else might happen in the future, if you have a con that's drivable,

460
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,780
or let's say in California, or like Reno, or even Oregon, hell, let us know, we'll try

461
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,980
to come if you'd like to have us there, otherwise if it's something we've got to fly to, it

462
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,500
just depends on the budget, and by budget, I mean how much money we have in our pockets,

463
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,980
because we don't, you notice we don't run ads on this show, meaning we have no money.

464
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,220
Mark from Plymouth, England sends us the next email, it's a bit long, so I'm just going

465
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,180
to read some of this here, he says, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, although the track of this

466
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,140
message may lead you to at first think that I might be. I want to start by saying that

467
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,420
here in the UK there's no real Nintendo history, as back as in the 80s, Commodore 64 and ZX

468
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,100
Spectrum ruled the gaming of everyone, and Nintendo was almost unknown to me and my friends

469
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,600
until I was too old and busy with serious things, busy with serious dating to get back

470
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,540
into it, here the NES and SNES were pretty much unknown things. Now my main point, Wii

471
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,660
isn't increasing the gamer base, as mentioned by you on episode 277, and often it's a war

472
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,740
cry by many of the too many podcasts I listen to. I know you don't hate the Wii and are

473
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,620
open about its strengths and weaknesses, however I believe not as my personal experience as

474
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,660
I am a gamer, definitely not hardcore, although I'm very much into all the latest news, I'm

475
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,100
presently most all about handhelds due to access issues to the big ass TV. My Wii is

476
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,420
also freely played by my wife, who would categorize herself as a non-gamer and her family, in

477
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,340
fact my next night shift has been scheduled for a Wii Fit night, in which my wife invited

478
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,680
her friends and sisters for drinks and laughs on the board. This type of sociability has

479
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,580
led all in the family to believe, all the family to buying Wii's, and they are now the

480
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,060
prime console, the collateral fallout is that many others in the household now play, whereas

481
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,500
before one person, maybe two, per household played the kids and parents are buying games

482
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,360
for the Wii. Is there any figures on players per console for old and present gen? I'd like

483
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,060
to bet the figure has risen. Is there anything like that? I doubt it. I don't know. I'm gonna

484
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,820
kind of cut some of this email out that he was just sort of making the point that, you

485
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,220
know, the Wii is definitely kind of caught on in that way, but what about, you know,

486
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,180
the software? He talks about why do some shovelware games sell well? Is that the taste of light

487
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,180
gamers are different and a lot of early games to the Wii are games ported over from PS2

488
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,500
games? It's because people don't know any better, the moms and pops that are going to

489
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,020
like stores that are buying their kids games, they look at it, they're like, okay well they

490
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,660
can get Mario Kart and they can get this other game that looks very similar, and all they

491
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,860
have to go by is the pictures on the back and stuff and the price point and they're

492
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,300
like, well it's, you know, it's $20 cheaper or $30 cheaper, so hey let's go ahead and

493
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,500
give it a shot. And unfortunately it's just like movies, you know, you may like go to

494
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,060
your, you know, Reynolds store or whatever and you're looking at the back of the movie

495
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,660
and all you have to go by is the cover and, you know, what it says on the back and you

496
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,700
can bring it home and it's complete shit, so. Alright, let's get to Mark's second half

497
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,700
here where he has a question. I still haven't dipped my toes into the HD gaming experience.

498
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,300
I like the PS3 but I'm not sure due to price and limited titles, although a good six would

499
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,660
do me for now. I hate Metal Gear Solid as it just doesn't float my boat personally.

500
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,780
I hate cut scenes. The Xbox 360 has a catalog but I get burned on the original Xbox when

501
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,980
shortly after buying one they went and retired it for the 360. Also my brother has gone through

502
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,700
four 360s. So is now a good time to buy a 360? Have the issues of Red Ring of Death

503
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,420
been cured or should I wait a little longer as the trading games pile is getting bigger

504
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,780
every day? Is the smaller, cooler 360 on the horizon? I know it's an old question from

505
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:46,100
last year and before but now the 360 is maturing or has it lost its legs and arthritis is setting

506
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,540
in or is now the time to jump in? And the arcade is cheaper than the Wii right now.

507
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:55,100
I have no intention of going online. Is a hard drive necessary for the download content

508
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,100
or do I have to accept the patches or the wave of the future? I would say that it's

509
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:07,180
probably fine to buy it now. I think 360 is probably going to be at its peak for the next

510
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,220
couple of years. You're right, the system has matured but that's when all the really

511
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,860
good games start coming out over the next couple of years and then we'll start getting

512
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,940
into a new cycle of systems. As far as hardware problems go, the new 360s that they have out

513
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,860
now aren't really as prone to the hardware problems. The main one that people are worried

514
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,280
about is the 3 Ring thing and they've still got the extended warranty on it. So I would

515
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,580
say you're probably better off now buying a newer console but just make sure you're

516
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,900
buying a newer console and not a refurbished older one. That's pretty much it. Here's what

517
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,620
you've got to watch out for is that maybe a new 360 is going to come out. This is really

518
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,780
inevitable with every console but there were some strong rumors this week. I don't think

519
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,820
I'm spoiling anything on show. There were some very strong rumors this week about the

520
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:55,260
Blu-ray and I guess actually a press release was put out so it might be more than rumor.

521
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,060
Blu-ray or the Xbox 360 is actually going to be getting a Blu-ray in it. Somebody's

522
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,220
been contracted to actually put that technology together where the Blu-ray, Xbox 360 is going

523
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,940
to be coming out because HD DVD is officially dead. Microsoft is left with no choice but

524
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,940
to get on the Blu-ray board if they want their system to play movies as well. They're not

525
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,380
DVD, HD movies. So you've got to be careful because you never know what's going to happen.

526
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,860
The day after you buy your system, this might come out but that's just a chance you take.

527
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,300
It happens with anything. Ask anyone who owns an Apple product. You buy an iPhone and then

528
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,060
a few months later, super iPhone! Watch, there will be a super iPhone this year just so you

529
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:42,300
know. RossdielUT wrote us and wanted to get in a few words about this. I want to get in

530
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,420
a few words on the idea of gays in gaming. Sexuality isn't anywhere near as taboo as

531
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,620
it was five or so years ago. Now it seems that every other game is so chock full of

532
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,780
cock teasing that it borders on the tasteless. Dead or Alive is built entirely upon sexual

533
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,140
exploitation and the guy game was only pulled off the shelves because it featured an underage

534
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,240
girl going topless. The reason we don't see gay characters in games or even a very deep

535
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,540
exploration of sexuality besides making women as slutty as possible has nothing to do with

536
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,380
the rating systems out there. Conan, a god of war, had frontal nudity as you know. The

537
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,180
problem here is the striking lack of diversity in the gaming industry. While game players

538
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,720
come from all faiths, colors, creeds, and orientations, game developers do not. The

539
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,020
overwhelming majority of game developers in the West are straight white men who in turn

540
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,040
only know how to make games aimed at straight white men. I imagine any meeting of game developers

541
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,020
in the West sounding like something straight out of Xbox Live with the types of things

542
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,500
you hear there on Xbox Live. What do you think so far? Do you think that might be why you

543
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,500
don't see it is because of the people developing it? But I'm always of the mindset that well

544
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,580
if you want to get other audiences into gaming maybe you ought to start putting that kind

545
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:51,060
of stuff into games. Well I think that also they also run the problem with like the ESRB.

546
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,740
They rate that kind of crap, you know, more offensive than female nudity. Alright well

547
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,260
Rastu goes on, of course I can't talk about this without mentioning the audience. Go to

548
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,260
any internet gaming forum, for that matter Xbox Live, and you'll find rampant sexism

549
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,100
and homophobia. One need only look at what happened to Jade Raymond, leading up to the

550
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,260
launch of Assassin's Creed. For months last year, sites like Kotaku and Joystiq were more

551
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,080
concerned with making creepy blogs about how nice she looked and smelled than covering

552
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,600
the goddamn game. The idiocy climax in a horrific comic depicting Jade, a well-educated, experienced

553
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,860
professional game developer, as a brainless bimbo who can't even pronounce creative, trying

554
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,980
to get sales for the game by sucking off nerds ending in a bukkake scene. Given the gaming

555
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,420
industry's absolute incompetence when it comes to marketing and demographics research, everyone

556
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,440
assumes that the sexist and homophobes are the only people interested in games. The lack

557
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,180
of game sales on the Wii only helps to further this misconception. Thus we get more objectified

558
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,980
women and the role of gay characters is limited to the joke character like Makoto from Enchanted

559
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:54,220
Arms. With time, as gaming businesses learn the importance of demographics and stop belittling

560
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,620
people who aren't straight, white men, this will pass, we just need to hang on. Ross Deal

561
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,980
UT, this message brought to you by Pizza Hut, makers of the pure grease pizza. So, I don't

562
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,760
know. What do you think, Irene? You're a woman, an OMG girl that plays video games. Do you

563
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,760
think that games aren't coming out geared more towards women because... See, there's

564
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,420
a stereotype that women love playing puzzle games. I don't think it's so much that as

565
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:29,700
it is puzzle games don't have overly sexualized women in the games. As the woman that plays

566
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,580
puzzle pirates? No, yeah. I mean, that's part of the reason, because I don't have to think

567
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,900
about like, okay, I'm going to see some, you know, slutty things, some woman like, you

568
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,940
know, slutified in this game or whatever, but... Although, that sounds like a good idea

569
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:50,940
for a puzzle game. Puzzle Sluts. Yay! OMG, let's put that on the OLR dream game list.

570
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,300
What would Puzzle Sluts be? It would just be like an over-sexified version of like,

571
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,900
you know, any sort of puzzle game. It's gotta be better than Bubble Bath Babes, though.

572
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:05,140
It's gotta be much better than that. How exactly would Puzzle Sluts work? Well, they have like...

573
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,020
But they need to have, okay, there needs to be like a code that you put in, like up, up,

574
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,540
down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and you get male Puzzle Sluts. Because

575
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,420
we need something for everybody in this game. Okay, I think I can see how this might work.

576
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,300
You would have in each, like, so let's say, let's go the route of like, say, Puzzle Fighter,

577
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,880
okay? Alright. So, you would have inside each one of the gems, like, a different woman.

578
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,940
And when you break the gem, they would fall to the bottom of the screen and, you know,

579
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,460
more gems next to each other and they just start kind of going at it in the bottom of

580
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:44,460
the screen until you get this big orgy that pile up in the bottom. I like it. Brilliant.

581
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:52,660
Brilliant. Patent pending. Nobody steal it. I don't know. Okay, like, here's a good example.

582
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Heavenly Sword. You know how the main character is like this hot chick that, you know, kicks

583
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,740
ass and all that stuff. I was kind of detracted from it because it was just like, come on,

584
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,500
you know, that's totally not realistic. Like, if she were just a normal girl, I probably

585
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,820
would have been more inclined to play it. Been more focused on actual gameplay than,

586
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,260
like, ogling over her or whatever. But I don't know. I think that something like putting,

587
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,820
you know, gay characters or sensible women in games is something that's gonna have to

588
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,900
be left up to independent, you know, game producers. Well, like, for example, Saints

589
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:35,260
Row 2 that's coming out, you can be a male and or female character or you can be a transsexual

590
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,220
in the game and run around and you can totally customize your characters and stuff. But you

591
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,320
know people that are gonna be playing Saints Row aren't gonna be playing them, like, seriously.

592
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,180
They're gonna be playing them to mock them. I gotta show you this, though. Now, does this

593
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,340
pique your interest, Irene? Because this story came up earlier this week and I don't think

594
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,740
it's on our show tonight, but Lost Planet Colonies is going to be, I guess they're getting

595
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,140
a new version of it coming out. It's some type of expansion. One of the characters in

596
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,140
it is the Dead Rising star, you know, Frank West, but he doesn't have clothes on. He's

597
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,620
just wearing a skimpy little pair of blue and yellow boxer briefs. That's all he's wearing.

598
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,560
Now, is that maybe the contrast to your Heavenly Sword? Would you maybe be interested in checking

599
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,240
out Lost Planet Colonies? Because, hello, good looking man running around in his skimpy

600
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,780
undies. See, that's debatable. I don't think he looks good. And he's kinda retarded to

601
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,460
be running around on this, like, frozen wasteland. Yeah, it's kinda weird. He's like, I'm fine.

602
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:36,100
Well, that won't do at all. Yeah. I guess sex does sell, but do they really need to

603
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,940
sexualize people? I mean, there are plenty of good games. Act Deft, by the way, is clearing

604
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,100
up. It's like the greatest hits version of the game. Yeah, they added more crap to it.

605
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,940
See, I don't follow Lost Planet. Sorry, guys. Remember when games, you didn't even have

606
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,860
to care about their sexuality? Mario walking around, like, in overalls and shit, you know,

607
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,460
like, well, but as I think stories become more, I mean, let's face it, video games today

608
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,340
are practically big-budget movies. Big, big-budget movies. And, you know, we, you know, kinda

609
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,180
like to see that sort of representation in movies as well. And it took a while for movies

610
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,340
to get there, but it got there. Okay, tell me which Yuna you like better. Do you like

611
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:17,040
Yuna from Final Fantasy X, or do you like her better in X-2? Because, remember, she

612
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,220
got all hella slutty in the second one. I, I guess as a character, I just like X's story

613
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,300
better. So I liked her better in X, but X-2 is like bubblegum pop fun. X-2 is like, today

614
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:35,100
I'm in the mood to listen to the Spice Girls because I'm just in that mood. Okay. Final

615
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,540
Fantasy X is, today I'm listening to Depeche Mode because I'm emo. Okay, yeah, I guess

616
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,220
it also depends on what kind of mood you're in. If you just wanna play, like, your motivation

617
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,340
behind playing the game, but if it's strictly to, like, get off, it's just silly. It's like,

618
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,860
come on. Is that what you're gonna base your game on? Some kind of, like, sexy character

619
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,300
or something? You can't do more with what you have. You can't be creative. Alright,

620
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,420
well let's, let's do some more emails here, cause I wanna get through the rest of these

621
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,380
emails tonight. Ben from Tokyo has emailed us. Wanted to clear some things up. We were

622
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,020
talking about Singapore. Speaking of, you know, the gays gaming thing, we talked to

623
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,860
last week about how in Singapore, they're adding homosexuality to what is instantly

624
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,620
making a game adults only overseas. And that was Mass Effect was impacted by that because

625
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,460
it was OMG Lesbians for, like, five seconds in the game. So Ben wrote us, says, love the

626
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,020
show, wanna keep it short, I have to rant about some stuff. Singapore. In Singapore

627
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:32,180
it is basically illegal to be gay. Illegal as in, you go to jail. More precise would

628
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:36,700
be to say that anything openly gay is banned. Gays are not employed by public offices, not

629
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,020
allowed to live in certain areas. That part also holds for certain foreigners and homosexual

630
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,680
acts are illegal. So complaining about the rating system is like accusing a serial killer

631
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,780
of fashion crimes. By the way, it is only the American rating system that is crazy about

632
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,600
sexual topics. That's just, it's so disheartening to read. I mean, you do have to remember that,

633
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,760
you know, we are kind of lucky sometimes to live in a nation that, at least we don't get

634
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,380
arrested for it, even though there's still a lot of progress to make. You know, you look

635
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,880
at countries like Canada and Spain and wherever where gays can get married and it's just whatever.

636
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,500
No one cares because it's not like OMG they're gonna come into my house and redecorate things.

637
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,100
Watch out. It's, you know, it's just whatever, you know. People are so much more laid back

638
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,060
and then sometimes you have to come to that harsh reality where like, wow, you know, America

639
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:30,740
is way ahead of some other people. Kind of just sad. Just sad. Yeah, but even California

640
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,900
is kind of more the exception anyway. I mean, if you go to any other place in the US, you

641
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,460
probably, they probably won't be as accepting. Yeah, it depends. It just depends. Like I

642
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,460
was saying last week, I think we're getting to a point, I think we're very lucky, where

643
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:52,340
most 20-somethings and most younger 30-somethings and most teenagers even. I think teenagers

644
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,820
even more so. Everybody knows someone who's gay and more and more people just have the

645
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,540
attitude of whatever. It's no big deal. It's just whatever. They realize it doesn't mean

646
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:08,460
they're suddenly gonna fuck me in the ass when I'm not looking. I think people are over

647
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,780
that real kind of childish mentality about it, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like,

648
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,380
is that what they're really afraid of? Like, oh my god, he's gonna come fuck me in the

649
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,900
ass. I don't know. I have no idea. It's just comical to me. I'm left to assume. It's funny.

650
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,060
I don't know. It is stupid. Alright. Copyright. Ben wanted to say something about copyright

651
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,300
too. While you just mentioned it briefly, I have to say that downloading fan subs and

652
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,140
any other copyrighted material is of course illegal, even if there is no licensing in

653
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,720
your country. Without licensing, there is just nobody to complain about it. That doesn't

654
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,580
make it legal. Thus, fan subs are in a somewhat gray area. Note that this only holds if your

655
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,980
country has a copyright law, which, for example, Thailand at least didn't have for a long time.

656
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,460
So that kind of came up on last week's show about the whole copyright thing went back

657
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,460
and forth. So there you have it. More emails. I know there's a lot tonight, but actually

658
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,600
these are pretty good. Rama emailed us very happy. There was a mention of video power

659
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,180
on last week's show and was kind of running down video power a little bit. The first season

660
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,180
at Johnny Arcade, he would come into the room, talk about games for five minutes that he's

661
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,140
going to review, and then there was a 20-minute cartoon. But the second season was a game

662
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,140
show. Four people would get a chance to ask Johnny a question to compete on the show.

663
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,420
First round was getting the highest score in a game. Second round was trivia questions.

664
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,300
After that was the round where you ran through the game area and you could get, you know,

665
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,360
Jansport bags, Genesis, and Neo Geo console. I pretty much think that Acclaim did a majority

666
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,180
of the sponsorship of the show, but I could be wrong. Well, that's it for now. Keep up

667
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,500
the good work, and y'all in two months for OLRCon 2008. There's an OLRCon 2008?

668
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Yeah. Wow.

669
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,060
Where the hell have I been?

670
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,260
I don't know. Where have you been?

671
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,940
I heard something was going down over 4th of July, but I didn't know we were like actually

672
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,820
having a little convention. What the crap? Am I always the last one to hear about this?

673
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,820
Hear about what?

674
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
OLRCon.

675
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,220
I guess there's an OLRCon happening. Like, I think it's 4th of July. I know. Rama, you

676
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,820
need to email me and tell me. I've not been told about this.

677
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,540
Nor have I.

678
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,740
Or I forgot. You know what? I'm human. I might have forgot. I'll go. I mean, obviously, if

679
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:17,100
it's OLRCon, I guess I'll go, but I'm just kind of curious what's going on. Well, let's

680
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,620
advertise it on the show if something's going on.

681
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,340
And lastly, Rama closes with, this email was brought to you by Joey Paisanos of Mulberry

682
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,880
Street in the heart of Little Italy. You'll love Paisanos. Suddenly, everybody's attaching

683
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:40,060
a commercial to their ads. Let's see. One more email for you guys. Again, I can't get

684
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,060
to them all tonight.

685
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,900
ShadowNextGen emails us, after you bashed IGN last week for giving Grand Theft Auto

686
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,100
4 a 10 out of 10 and suggesting that something shady might be going on due to them having

687
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,000
the exclusive, what is your opinion now that the majority of other sites have also given

688
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,180
this game 10 out of 10 scores? I think RossdielUT was completely off the mark last week with

689
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,740
his rants over reviews, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts. If a game is bad such

690
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,380
as Laird, then the review scores will reflect it. If the game is good such as Grand Theft

691
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,500
Auto 4, then the review scores will reflect that as well. Thoughts keep up the good work.

692
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,820
Here it is. I never said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was probably not going to get 10s out

693
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,580
of 10s from everywhere, and it's probably pretty deserving of those 10s out of 10s.

694
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,180
I'm just saying that kind of policy about, you know, sure we'll accept the exclusive.

695
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,260
What was it? I think they came out and admitted that they had traded for advertising on the

696
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,820
site to get the exclusive review. I mean, that kind of sets a bad precedent because

697
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,580
yes, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a good, good game, I don't know. What about games in the

698
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:40,740
future? Yeah, because they said, oh yeah, this didn't affect our review score. Let's

699
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,900
not forget about what went down at GameSpot and Kane and Lynch. Hello. Well, let's not

700
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,920
forget what happened at GameSpot and Grand Theft Auto 4 where there was a review that

701
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,100
leaked out that gave it a 9.5 and then that was retracted and there was a 10.0 review

702
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,740
put out. You know, who's to say that they weren't going to do that? And apparently there

703
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:05,540
is a process where they rate it and then they do a peer review process and then they re-rate

704
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,980
it or some shit like that. I don't know, it's just, it's fishy and not to say that this

705
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,540
game wouldn't have gotten, you know, high marks anyways, but it's still fishy and it's

706
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,780
not a really good situation to be in, especially after the whole, you know, Kane and Lynch

707
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:26,420
thing. Okay, and honestly, do people really give a shit? Oh, we rated it 9.5, but really

708
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,080
it's a 10. We were off by 0.5. It's like, okay, it's a good game. We get what you're

709
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,660
conveying with your ranking. It's just more crap that they can throw up in their advertising

710
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,700
campaigns for it. It's been rated a 10 by IGN, you know, 10 out of 10 and they can throw

711
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,940
that in their commercials and advertise that shit and it's just more like, you know, points

712
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:54,380
for them, I guess. Okay. Alright, well, there's our thoughts on that and that's going to do

713
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,140
it for the mailbag. If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. I'm going

714
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,140
to tell you guys for future weeks, honestly, the more condensed you can make your emails,

715
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,020
the better because, you know, our mailbag statement has been going kind of long lately,

716
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,960
so we're going to have to start getting choosier. So, we do try to condense down big emails,

717
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,220
but if you can do that, it makes it all the better. So, just so you know. If you want

718
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,860
to go off for a longer period of time, there is always a Skype line. If you listen to us

719
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:27,780
live Sunday nights on allgames.com. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki. Okay,

720
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:34,180
well, there's a new card game coming out, not Eye of Judgment, but it's being released

721
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:40,620
by EA. It's called Battle Forge, the collectible trading card game. It's coming out this fall

722
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,660
and doesn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but they're comparing it to, of course,

723
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:53,140
Magic the Gathering. It's a fantasy online real-time strategy game with collectible trading

724
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,340
cards and says the game will release this fall, allow players to win, trade, and buy

725
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:04,340
virtual cards to create the ultimate deck. So, it's like, I guess, Magic the Gathering

726
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:10,460
online, but the way I see it, it's another way for EA to sell a lot of download content.

727
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:16,060
That's really all it is. It's a download content whoring machine.

728
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,820
Huh. Because you know developers these days love these things where they can just charge

729
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,460
extra money for the expansions and all that stuff, huh?

730
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,200
Exactly. You know, it's a collectible card game. What they're trying to do is they're

731
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,820
trying to make a game that captures the fans of Magic the Gathering. It's going to be at

732
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,980
the same level as Magic the Gathering and get people buying these card decks and stuff

733
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:48,060
like that as much as possible. So, I don't know. I guess it's a good idea strategy-wise,

734
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,780
but will people fall for it? I don't know.

735
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,780
All right. Well, R-Type Command is coming out on May 6th. That's coming out on the PSP.

736
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,060
It's R-Type the strategy game, which ought to be interesting. But what's kind of cool

737
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:03,260
about this is that Atlus has actually announced that they are going to be putting out just

738
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,260
for a limited time and just for those that buy the game from either GameStop, Amazon,

739
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,900
GameCrazy, EB Games Canada, and some other specific retailers, they get to get a little

740
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,980
free plastic miniature replica of the R9 spacecraft, which actually has that little pod thing in

741
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,860
front and everything. So, if you're a game collector, specifically one that likes shmups,

742
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,540
as they're called, then maybe you ought to think about getting this. Probably pre-orders

743
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,500
only through some of these chains. So, take a look.

744
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:36,420
Yeah. Another game coming out this fall as well on the DS, and probably a fan of Rob's

745
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:43,940
here, Tech Mobile Kickoff will be landing on the DS. They haven't really said too many

746
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,420
details on it yet, but here's what we do know. There's going to be a variety of teams with

747
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:53,820
32 to choose from. There will be all new cut scenes showing off dramatic presentations

748
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:59,320
of various plays, a customizable playbook, stylus control. Of course, it's going to have

749
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:07,580
Wi-Fi and wireless multiplayer, customizable teams, and it's based on, of course, Tecmo,

750
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,300
Super Bowl.

751
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,640
Very nice. By the way, tonight we were going to be doing the match game, but unfortunately

752
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,860
we didn't get around to it. Our resources were a little limited this week, so just a

753
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,840
reminder, because this is the point where we were supposed to do match game, but we're

754
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,780
tabling it to next week. Sorry kids. And that is, our contestants already picked. It's the

755
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,220
toshin and footy showdown for the res code. And if one of them is not here, then we'll

756
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:39,740
get somebody else. Because we're giving away that damn res code. It's going to happen next

757
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,740
week.

758
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,500
Yes. And another thing that's going to be happening relatively soon is a price drop

759
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:52,020
for the Xbox 360 in Asia. In fact, different price drops are happening in different regions

760
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:58,540
and all really odd percentages, but Hong Kong's getting an 11% price drop. Singapore, a 20%

761
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:11,060
price drop. Also, South Korea, a 5.1% price drop. And Taiwan, a 17% price drop. So, it's

762
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,980
very interesting. And I guess those price drops have already happened. They happened

763
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,380
earlier than last week, so.

764
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,620
Hooray for price drops. That makes some people very happy. Hey kids, we're going to be opening

765
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,100
up the Skype line very soon if you want to give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username

766
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,980
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but first we have a couple more quick stories for you guys.

767
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,960
One of them is the Famicom Mobile, or I'm sorry, the FC Mobile. I probably should say

768
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,380
it the other way because, you know, that would be a complete rip off of the name. But I guess,

769
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:47,020
I mean, it seems like the patent on Nintendo's thing has expired or something because all

770
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,860
these Nintendo knockoffs have been coming out lately. And now one of them is a mobile

771
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,500
system that will actually, not mobile phones, but a mobile system that will actually play

772
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,220
Nintendo games on the go. It can actually take the old Nintendo cartridges. It has a

773
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,300
2.4 inch color LCD screen. It runs on three AA batteries. It's got speakers, a place to

774
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,580
plug in headphones. You can plug the unit into the TV and play the NES games on the

775
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:16,620
TV. And it's being sold, I guess, overseas, but it only plays American NES games. You

776
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:22,380
can find them on eBay for 40 to 50 bucks. And that's because the patent expired for

777
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,180
the original NES, which makes me think in a couple of years the patent is going to expire

778
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,980
on the Super Nintendo, right? We're going to start seeing more and more of these as

779
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,300
years go on. Pretty soon, every CD player will have a PlayStation 1 in it. When that

780
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:42,340
patent expires, that's going to be interesting. We'll see. Unless they renew the patent, in

781
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:50,520
which case, then, uh oh. Now this is interesting. This is almost like seeing a unicorn, I guess.

782
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:58,540
But apparently, Shacknews website has actually seen Duke Nukem Forever, the game, in reality.

783
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,900
They've actually seen the real game being played. And apparently, I guess, Shacknews

784
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:12,900
is very close to 3D Realms offices. And they were shown about half an hour of footage from

785
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:20,860
the game, I guess, gameplay, including some environmental puzzles, interactivity, a host

786
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:26,580
of finished weapons, an existence of an in-game forklift, and plenty of heads and armor.

787
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:36,180
Oh my god, a forklift? Yes. What the fork? Let's see, it says, apparently, 3D Realms,

788
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:42,140
George Broussard, the developer, said, out of the blue, I just decided to show them Duke

789
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,100
Nukem Forever for about an hour. Well, I would like to see Duke Nukem Forever for about an

790
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:52,740
hour, and I'm sure a lot of other people would, too. I don't know, how about an idea? How

791
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,500
about you show the world Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour? How about you show them

792
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:07,460
for like two minutes? Is that so much to ask? Seriously. Wow. Do you think it's really,

793
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,020
really gonna come out? I think it will, but I think it'll underwhelm everybody. I guess

794
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:17,060
it's kind of like Prey. Even though I enjoyed Prey, it was kind of underwhelming to a lot

795
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,420
of people because there was so much that went into it, you know what I mean? Like, so much

796
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,620
hype and everything that went into it. And then I guess it kind of disappointed. And

797
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,660
the thing about Prey, it ended like that. The ending was just kind of out of the middle

798
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,220
of nowhere. It was kind of weird. I hear there's a sequel being planned, though, so we'll see

799
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:37,020
what happens with that. Alright, we're gonna open up the Skype line, finally. If you want

800
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:45,260
to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

801
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,740
You can always find out more about the Skype line and how it works if you go to www.orangeloungeradio.com

802
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,700
and click on interact with us. That gives you the whole spiel about how the Skype line

803
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:00,100
works. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? I got balls

804
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:05,980
of steel. Oh, I'm sorry, you're a little quiet. What's that, sir? I got balls of steel. You

805
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:12,300
have balls of steel. This is DJ Dark Knight. Hey, what's up, DJ Dark Knight? Oh, I see,

806
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,940
you're getting a little happy about the news about Duke Nukem Forever. No, just basically

807
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,900
doing the running gag of jokes everybody else has posted about the balls of steel thing.

808
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:28,300
Whoa, the audio quality on this call is no bueno. Something's going on there. Dark Knight,

809
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,500
your call quality is like really staticky and it's probably gonna drive our podcast

810
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,180
listeners nuts. Hurry up and get... I'm gonna give you like 10 seconds to get your question

811
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:42,740
out and then we're gonna have to let you go. Okay, just basically about the... I'm a little

812
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,740
bit late to the show because I've basically been testing something else out. Mostly about

813
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:54,820
the GTA 4 situation and whatnot and, I mean, how much longer do you think the man is gonna

814
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:00,580
be before it finally dies off? How long what is gonna be before it dies off? The whole...

815
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,940
Oh, the demand is gonna be before it dies off. All right, we'll answer your question,

816
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,220
Dark Knight. Take care, buddy. How long do you think it is gonna be before the demand

817
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,220
dies off? Well, look at all the other games that have come out. They've been selling well

818
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:16,700
for years. Hell, Granth of the Auto, San Andreas still sells really well. So, a while.

819
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,220
It's gonna keep selling through Christmas. Here's why, because not everybody's up to

820
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,500
the HDH. Here's the thing, there's this whole domino effect going on. This is why Granth

821
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,580
of the Auto 4 is gonna stay out there. It's because of the domino effect. By February

822
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:34,060
of 2009, lots of people are gonna have to buy new TVs. Actually, they only have to buy

823
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,300
digital converters for their TVs. And keep in mind, this is, I believe, America only.

824
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,220
I'm not sure if Canada's affected by this or other countries, but at least in America,

825
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:47,780
they have passed this thing where all television will be digital signals by February of 2009.

826
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:52,100
So, you have to get this digital converter for your television. But what's happening

827
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,480
is most people are getting scared. Like, they don't understand it. So, most people are just

828
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,660
using it to buy a new TV that has digital in it. And a lot of people, especially when

829
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,120
you start talking about tax rebates, the stimulus coming up and everything, they're just going

830
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,340
up to HDTV. Why not? And I think you're gonna see HDTVs a lot throughout the year for birthdays

831
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:13,900
and Christmas. And here's the domino effect. As people get HDTVs, then they're gonna start

832
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,460
buying Xbox 360s and PlayStation 3s because they're gonna wanna play Blu-ray movies on

833
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:23,960
these TVs. This is why I believe the Xbox 360 and Blu-ray thing may be true. They're

834
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,220
gonna wanna get that out there by Christmas because they wanna get a part of this domino

835
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:33,100
effect because they get the high-def TVs, then they're gonna buy the Blu-ray players,

836
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,300
and then, of course, you wanna buy games that you play on these systems. Grand Theft Auto

837
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,500
has a lot of name recognition. This thing will continue to sell through Christmas for

838
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,900
that reason. Agree?

839
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,900
Yes.

840
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Yep.

841
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,140
All right. Good. You should always agree with me. All right. If you wanna give us a call,

842
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,180
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. While we wait for some calls,

843
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,020
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

844
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:59,660
Yes. Resistance Fall of Man 2 is gonna be playable at the PlayStation Day, which is

845
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:06,180
coming out on Tuesday, May 6th. So, I'm sure we're gonna see a lot of press releases coming

846
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:11,300
out of that, probably pretty soon. Something else also kinda tying in with PlayStation

847
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:18,740
Day. MotorStorm 2 has had a name change. Now it's being renamed MotorStorm Pacific Rift.

848
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,620
So, meaning it's MotorStorm 1 reskinned. Hi, caller, are you there? Who's this?

849
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,620
This is Spazinator.

850
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,620
I'm sorry?

851
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,620
Spazinator.

852
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,620
Spell that for me?

853
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:34,620
Yeah. The screen name I usually go by is Spazinator.

854
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,300
All right. Well, what's your question? What's on your mind, buddy?

855
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:46,420
Yeah. I was wondering, now that GTA 4 is out, do you think we're gonna be hearing from the

856
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:53,100
lawyer that we shall not name? We're gonna see you know where those lawsuits coming out

857
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,100
of the world work?

858
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,100
Absolutely, dude. We already have. He tried to get the sales of the game stopped. Here's

859
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,900
the thing. He's waiting. This is what this man is. He's a leech. And what's gonna happen

860
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,620
is the first time some poor, innocent kid gets killed by their cousin who's fucked in

861
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:14,820
the head after playing Grand Theft Auto 4, this leech is gonna leech right onto that

862
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,180
story and pin it on Grand Theft Auto and try to sue the makers and try to get the game

863
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,260
pulled from shelves. And heaven forbid if there's any hidden things this time around,

864
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,820
although I'm sure Take-Two took extra, extra precaution to Rockstar. They all took extra,

865
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,620
extra precaution to make sure there is nothing hidden on that disc.

866
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:39,980
Yeah. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there something mentioned maybe a few months

867
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:46,220
ago? You know, someone here, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but some kind of injunction

868
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:52,580
or something on this guy, you know, saying that, you know, he can't sue anyone or fucking

869
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,580
through that far?

870
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,660
I want to say Take-Two complained about him in the court, or wasn't it?

871
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,700
No, he's been, he's been, um, basically he has to get someone else to sign off on any

872
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,700
lawsuit that he does.

873
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,700
Oh, that was it, yeah.

874
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,380
But no, there is still right now a current-

875
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,380
But only in Florida, right?

876
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,380
No.

877
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,380
Was it? Oh.

878
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,380
Anywhere.

879
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
Wow.

880
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,380
Yeah.

881
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,380
Yeah.

882
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:30,100
I was going to say, one more thing, uh, before I let you guys get going to the next caller.

883
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:35,540
Um, you know, this may be just me, but I think we should probably promote this game as much

884
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,340
as possible, and give people the, buy this game as much as possible, just annoy the,

885
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,820
you know, what, as, as this lawyer, along with Hillary Clinton.

886
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:49,660
I mean, the more people these guys get, you know, at least in my book, the better, right?

887
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,180
What we really have to do, here's the strategy, is that, I mean, yeah, there's one way to

888
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,340
do it, but what we really have to try and do is not give this guy any credit.

889
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,300
We need to stop covering every little move he makes.

890
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,460
I mean, and I've used this comparison on the show before a while ago, but I haven't said

891
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,380
it in a while, he's the village idiot in our minds.

892
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,980
Every time this guy does something, we publish it, look what the village idiot did today,

893
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:17,100
you know, look at the lawsuit he filed today, you know, we need to stop giving him attention.

894
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,900
It's just like, you know, I don't know about you or any of our listeners or you guys, but

895
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,520
when I was getting bullied in school, it's happened to all of us, don't laugh Rice Princess,

896
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,020
but when I was getting bullied in school, my mom always said, don't pay attention to

897
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,420
them and they'll stop.

898
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,020
And to a certain extent, she was kind of right, the more you pay attention to these types

899
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,460
of things, they go away because they're there to ruffle feathers, it's what they do.

900
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,740
Yeah, you definitely get a point there.

901
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,740
All right.

902
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,220
Well, hey, we appreciate the call, do you have any last quick thoughts before we jump

903
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,220
to another call?

904
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,620
No, I think that pretty much covers it, thanks for taking my call.

905
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,820
No problemo, have a good night.

906
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,340
Bye, you too.

907
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,380
I like hearing from people we don't hear from too often.

908
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,580
Yeah, thanks for calling.

909
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,620
All right, yes, we appreciate that.

910
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,900
All right, more calls.

911
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:04,900
Now the phone's ringing off the hook.

912
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,620
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry, who's this?

913
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,260
Hey, hey, it's Ronma.

914
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:12,660
Ronma, I noticed the comment you just made in chat, bullshit, even if you do ignore bullies,

915
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,380
they will keep at it.

916
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:21,540
My problem was I got bullied in school, I ignored them, it kept going to the point where

917
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:25,260
I actually had to throw my fists up and get to a few fistfights.

918
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:33,020
I know, I realize that times have also changed from when I was a kid.

919
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,660
But I don't know, it's just, I always kind of think a lot of people do things for attention

920
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:43,420
and obviously there's extremes in every circumstance where people are just fucked in the head,

921
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,980
but a lot of times people do things for attention, if you don't give them attention, it'll go

922
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,020
away.

923
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:52,620
But there are people that just are sick, I don't know what else to say.

924
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,620
Let's talk about happier things.

925
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,900
So what did you call in to call in about tonight?

926
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,660
Talk more about Mario Kart Wii.

927
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,660
Wii!

928
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,900
Why aren't you on my friends list yet?

929
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,900
I added you.

930
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,740
Well, when you posted your code, I was away for Sakura Matsuri at a friend's house when

931
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:06,740
we got home.

932
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,580
We were playing Mario Kart Wii until about 5 o'clock in the morning.

933
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,940
You're not having that much fun with it, eh?

934
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,260
Yeah, I'm playing on the Classic Controller, everybody else is playing on GameCube Controllers.

935
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,140
I can't play on the Cube Controller so well, but I can rock on the Classic Controller without

936
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,140
any problems.

937
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,140
Wiimote Nunchuck for me.

938
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,140
I find controlling is easier on that.

939
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,140
Wiimote Nunchuck for me.

940
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,980
I tried it for a while, but I found I just couldn't get the controller with the thumb

941
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,980
tool.

942
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,140
I was like losing it, but it's like more natural with the Classic Controller.

943
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:37,460
I keep thinking of Super Mario Kart.

944
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,740
Do you think this is the best Mario Kart yet, or do you think it's somewhere in the middle,

945
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,740
or worse?

946
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:46,840
It's somewhere in the middle, because I really dig Mario Kart DS more.

947
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,780
But it's that, you know how they say they remove snaking and so forth?

948
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,940
If you do it right, you can still do it.

949
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,660
I just find it easier to do quote-unquote snaking and power boosting with the control

950
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,500
stick than I could with the control pad.

951
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,700
You know what's interesting though, is I find online, it doesn't seem like people are cheating

952
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:09,820
as much, because you have a lot of people on there that are playing with the wheel,

953
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,820
for one.

954
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,820
I noticed that.

955
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,820
There's tons of people online.

956
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,820
Yeah, a lot of people on the wheel.

957
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,380
And you know, it just seems like there's less cheating going on.

958
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,520
The only cheating in the game, and something I really should have mentioned in part A when

959
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,980
I review the game, here's the irritation I have with the game.

960
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,060
The items, I realize is a part of Mario Kart, it's got to be there.

961
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,460
It's a little much.

962
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,940
They really needed to scale back, and I think part of that might have to do with them expanding

963
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,380
it from like 8 to 12 cars at once.

964
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,020
There is just too many freaking blue shells that show up, you know what I mean?

965
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

966
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,020
A little much.

967
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,860
You ought to be able to turn some of that shit off when playing online.

968
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,860
Not yet, no.

969
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,860
Can you turn items off?

970
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,860
You can turn items off.

971
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,860
Oh, nice.

972
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,460
Well, all together, but you can't single one out.

973
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:51,300
Yeah, it'll be nice if they give you a little more customization when you just turn off

974
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,300
blue shells.

975
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,300
They have it where you can do like, you know, the powerful items will appear less, will

976
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,740
appear more, appear normal, but to be honest, playing through each different mode, I have

977
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,980
not noticed a difference.

978
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:10,900
Well, I have noticed that when you're in first place with probably Mario Kart games, all

979
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,500
you had at your disposal were banana peels and green turtle shells.

980
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:20,140
I've noticed now you're getting more powerful items like red turtle shells and other items

981
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,140
too, you know?

982
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,520
Once in a blue moon you get a red turtle shell, but you never get a bullet and you never get

983
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
a blue shell.

984
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,520
Well, obviously.

985
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,260
But I've gotten a lot of red shells being in first place, but I've also noticed that

986
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:35,940
when I'm in first place, a shitload of shells just hit me out of nowhere.

987
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:41,860
Sometimes the best strategy online, honestly, is to stay in second and hang onto a golden

988
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,780
mushroom for the end if you can get one.

989
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,180
Have you checked out the Super NES tracks on the game yet?

990
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:52,660
Um, yeah, like I, well, I'm only a little bit through, like I played all the new tracks

991
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,700
and now I'm working my way through the bot, I'm only on 50cc, okay, because I was playing

992
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,900
online for a long time, but I did play the Ghost Valley is in the first set and that

993
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,900
was pretty cool.

994
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:06,100
Yeah, I just love how they brought back the original power boosters and not a remix theme,

995
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,260
the original themes, that's, I was really enjoying that.

996
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:15,100
It seems like they've still been slightly retouched, but they're, it's still, it's quality.

997
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,260
It's not, you know, they didn't ruin them.

998
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:20,940
Now, Sky, before I go, let me ask you to see if you agree with me.

999
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,740
With the Wiimote and Nunchuck controller, do you think it should have been more natural

1000
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:30,700
to use the Wiimote when you shake it to throw an item instead of doing tricks?

1001
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,340
No, because I think it might be too sensitive and sometimes, you know, you get a little

1002
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,740
excited, you kind of move around, you hop around, especially if you're getting in the

1003
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,740
heat of it.

1004
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,540
You just have a bad feeling that it would, and I sit kind of far away from the TV, so

1005
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,380
when I'm playing, the sensitivity is kind of, or, you know, if I'm trying to like point

1006
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,380
at the screen, it's really hard.

1007
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,180
I've got to lean forward to get at the screen.

1008
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:53,500
I just have a bad feeling it would screw things up.

1009
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,640
Probably with all the precautions they tell you, I think it'd just be more fun, you know,

1010
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,120
to shake the Wiimote to throw the item.

1011
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:04,660
But then again, some of us are a little bit too heavy-handed and we'll send it flying

1012
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:10,420
across the room, and we just got a new 32-inch HDTV, and if that happens, somebody's getting

1013
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,420
their neck snapped.

1014
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,420
I'll meet you halfway.

1015
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,700
They ought to add custom controls where you can assign whatever you want.

1016
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Agreed.

1017
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,700
All right.

1018
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:23,460
Rama, thanks so much for the call, and really quickly, OLRCon, what's up with this?

1019
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,180
Is there a big meeting happening somewhere here that we need to go to?

1020
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,180
Do we need to rent out the Elk's Lodge for a night?

1021
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,900
It's pretty much my return to the West Coast like you wanted me to.

1022
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,900
All right.

1023
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,220
What's that?

1024
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,820
It's my return to the West Coast like everybody wanted me to.

1025
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,140
And he said, well, we've got to figure out where we're getting together and have an

1026
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,140
apartheid.

1027
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,900
Well, I do know, I am crashing on Doc Sakura's couch for three days, which would be pretty

1028
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,100
awesome, and I will be bringing some stuff.

1029
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,240
And I'll probably bring some New York City trinkets as well.

1030
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,580
It's Fourth of July weekend?

1031
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,580
Mm-hmm.

1032
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:57,700
You know, if it wasn't summer, I'd say let's have a late birthday party for me at Roseville

1033
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,620
Golf Land, but it's summer and that's going to suck.

1034
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,860
Well, we can kind of make an agreement.

1035
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,540
My birthday's past, too, maybe we could do something like that together.

1036
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,700
We'll figure something out.

1037
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,020
All right, we'll talk more about it offline.

1038
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,020
The listeners don't want to hear about it.

1039
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,020
All right.

1040
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,020
Take care, buddy.

1041
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,020
You, too.

1042
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,020
All right.

1043
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,020
Bye.

1044
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,020
Bye.

1045
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,980
But if you're in Northern California, specifically the Sacramento area, you might want to stay

1046
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,140
tuned the next few episodes because we're going to do something.

1047
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,300
I know we have some listeners in the SAC area.

1048
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,940
Loki, quickly, any other last minute stories?

1049
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,940
Yes.

1050
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,540
Let's see here.

1051
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:34,580
The ESRB has added some more Xbox Live Arcade games to their list of stuff coming out, including

1052
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:45,700
Samurai Showdown 2, of course, Red Baron for the arcade, Red Baron arcade, which is interesting,

1053
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,580
and the Revenge of the Plague Lord, but we knew that was coming.

1054
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:54,420
That was for Puzzle Quest, the expansion.

1055
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,420
Let's see.

1056
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:59,260
This is an interesting turn for download content for Rock Band.

1057
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:06,380
Apparently, Best Buy is running an offer where if you pre-order Disturb's new album, you

1058
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:15,180
actually will get a code for two free downloadable Rock Band tracks for the actual album, including

1059
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:25,380
Indestructible, which is the cover track for that, and Inside the Fire.

1060
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:33,500
That's kind of interesting, and then, let's see here, Guitar Hero 3 this week will be

1061
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:41,920
getting three songs from Muse, including, let's see, Exopolitics, Supermassive, Black

1062
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:51,020
Hole, and Stockholm Syndrome, and they're going to cost 500 Microsoft points, and one

1063
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,360
other thing we talked a little bit about earlier with the Virtual Console and people hacking

1064
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,360
it.

1065
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:01,980
Now, they've already hacked and pirated WiiWare games, and they have actually brought over

1066
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:07,340
some of the Japanese WiiWare games to the North American Virtual Console.

1067
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:11,300
You can actually find those online if you're into that kind of thing, but I just think

1068
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:21,500
it's funny how quickly they've hacked those apart already.

1069
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,220
And that's pretty much it.

1070
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:30,900
Oh, and a rumor of a Blu-ray console coming to the market, or a Blu-ray-included 360 coming

1071
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,220
to the market in third quarter, although I don't believe that, but we'll see.

1072
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,100
You know, I was listening to Bobby show a little bit, and he made a pretty good argument

1073
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,400
for why it is happening, and plus, I think what I said earlier about the whole domino

1074
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,740
effect, I think it's damn well possible something like that's going to happen.

1075
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,160
It's just a matter of time.

1076
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,740
I think it's just going to be hard with alienating their customers, but if they only use it for

1077
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,980
video playback, then that's fine.

1078
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,660
As long as they don't start coming out with Blu-ray games, I absolutely agree with you

1079
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,660
there.

1080
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,020
I absolutely agree with you there.

1081
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,020
Let's go to the phones.

1082
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1083
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,020
Who's this?

1084
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,020
Who's PT?

1085
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,580
Hey, Dark Dead Tsuya.

1086
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,580
What is on your mind, my friend?

1087
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,580
I don't know.

1088
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,060
I was trying to get in, but it kept going to voicemail.

1089
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:12,060
Yeah, well, we were letting Loki do some last minute stories for a little bit before we

1090
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,060
opened it back up.

1091
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,060
What's on your mind?

1092
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,060
Okay.

1093
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,060
Oh, sure.

1094
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,060
Ron?

1095
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,060
Huh?

1096
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,060
We're here.

1097
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,060
What's up?

1098
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:25,700
You might have to lower the speakers in your house because you're probably hearing feedback.

1099
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Yeah.

1100
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,700
Oh, well, sorry.

1101
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,700
Yeah.

1102
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,700
Okay.

1103
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,700
I got it.

1104
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,700
So, yeah.

1105
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:38,780
Rama has OLRCon, but I had OLR Central in October.

1106
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,300
We have competing conventions going on.

1107
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:47,740
Apparently, there's... Rama's OLRCon is happening in July, and then we have... Misty's coming

1108
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,140
out here, right?

1109
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,140
Yeah.

1110
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:53,860
We have the Misty Dark Tetsuya OLR Central, or whatever they're calling it, happening

1111
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,860
in October.

1112
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,860
And none of which I've heard of.

1113
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:56,860
So, it's awesome.

1114
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,260
No, I think they've talked about the October thing before.

1115
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,260
Here's the deal, buddy.

1116
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,700
We'll make time.

1117
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,580
The year is a long time.

1118
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,500
Definitely, we want to meet Misty.

1119
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,960
Definitely, we want to entertain Rama while he's here.

1120
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,140
You know what?

1121
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,220
If other strangers from the internet want to fly out here, why not?

1122
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,220
Come on over.

1123
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,900
We'll have a party.

1124
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,620
My roommate's probably going to kill me for saying that.

1125
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,620
Good idea.

1126
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,620
He loves that idea.

1127
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,620
But, you know, whatever.

1128
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,300
We'll make time for it all.

1129
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,300
I'm not worried about it.

1130
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,540
And then somebody's going to say, let's do OLR Expo in August.

1131
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,580
Yes, there totally are.

1132
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,580
It is all good.

1133
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,580
We will have fun.

1134
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,540
You know, in October is enough time to cool down from July, from all the partying we're

1135
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,540
going to do with Rama's here.

1136
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,500
We'll be good to go again for some Olive Garden, Home of the Never Ending Breadsticks, and

1137
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
all of that.

1138
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Yeah.

1139
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,500
All right.

1140
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,500
Anything else on your mind?

1141
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,500
Or an iron.

1142
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Anything else on your mind, Dark Tetsuya?

1143
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:53,500
I don't know, I was thinking about that portable Famicom thing.

1144
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,500
That sounded pretty cool.

1145
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
Yeah, I know.

1146
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,980
You know, it's not too bad, $40 or $50, considering it's portable and everything, and what an

1147
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,980
awesome piece of retro.

1148
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,940
I'm going to have to ask Jamie if she's going to pick up one of those.

1149
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:03,940
I hear it just plays Nintendo.

1150
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:04,940
Oh, sorry.

1151
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,940
Yeah, and you know.

1152
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,140
I hear it just plays Nintendo games.

1153
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,140
It does.

1154
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,140
It does.

1155
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,140
It doesn't play any of the other stuff.

1156
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,580
But, you know, I was thinking, well, where would you actually be able to get Nintendo

1157
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,580
games?

1158
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,900
Because, you know, everybody stopped carrying them a long time ago.

1159
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,100
Like, flea markets and garage sales, you can pick shit up for, like, 50 cents a month.

1160
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,460
Game cra- or, not game crazies, but, uh, playing trades, I think, still carry Nintendo.

1161
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,260
Okay, like, there's one of those stores in the Sacramento region.

1162
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,660
You've got to think bigger, big stores.

1163
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,660
They're a chain.

1164
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,660
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,660
There's, like, there's, like, 300 stores.

1166
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,660
What?

1167
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,660
In the U.S.

1168
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,660
I thought there was only one of them here.

1169
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,660
No.

1170
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,660
Oh, funny.

1171
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:38,660
Okay, my bad.

1172
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:43,060
No, um, and then there's also, uh, well, locally, we've got a record store, um, Dimple.

1173
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,640
They carry NES games.

1174
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,640
You know, when I-

1175
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:52,220
When I was in New York City for, uh, NYOLRCon, when I was there, um, last year, we actually

1176
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,980
all went to a video game store, and, uh, they had old Nintendo games.

1177
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,300
I remember because I found a copy of the Guardian Legend, which I bought for my friend who let

1178
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,940
me stay at her place in New York City.

1179
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:05,220
She lives in Brooklyn, and she has an old school Nintendo, and I bought it for her,

1180
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:09,100
and I said, Amanda, that's her name, Amanda, I said, Amanda, this is the best video game

1181
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,300
of all time.

1182
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,460
You need to treasure this game.

1183
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,540
I don't think the bitch has played it yet.

1184
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,580
She's too busy with WoW.

1185
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:21,380
Cause Irene, I know Irene called her and was like, Amanda, Karazhan, even though I don't

1186
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,460
think Irene's ever talked to her, but anyway, Video Games New York was the name of the store

1187
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:30,460
according to Rama, so, alright, DT, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you

1188
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:31,460
go?

1189
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,420
Oh, well, I just hope, uh, Granny Sue comes out in the US.

1190
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,420
What?

1191
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,420
Two comes out in the US?

1192
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,420
Granny Sue.

1193
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,420
Ooh, I hope so too.

1194
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,300
I, you know what, I think the odds of seeing that are much more than Choaniki here in the

1195
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,300
US.

1196
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,300
Oh God, yeah.

1197
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,700
Alright, DT, take care, have a good week, okay?

1198
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,700
And we'll see you in October.

1199
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,700
Yeah, you too.

1200
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,700
Alright.

1201
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,700
See you later.

1202
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,700
Bye bye.

1203
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,700
Although you should really come to the July one too, if you can.

1204
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,700
You should come to both.

1205
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,380
Alright, this is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

1206
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:03,740
We're gonna go ahead and start to close out the show, cause it's getting late.

1207
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,940
Considering it was a slow news week, we did a good job filling up three hours.

1208
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,660
I'm quite proud of the cast tonight.

1209
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:11,660
Alright, so, uh, we gotta go around and get everybody's final thought.

1210
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,740
Loki, do you have a final thought?

1211
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:17,580
More Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.

1212
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,420
Rice Princess, thank you for being here this week.

1213
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,140
Appreciate you being here as always.

1214
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,940
And by the way, thank you so much for stealing the mushroom that, um, Eddie the Gay.

1215
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,360
Uh, no, he, okay, he had four of them.

1216
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,100
He gave one to me and three to you.

1217
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,220
You didn't take- I've totally forgot today.

1218
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,220
I'm gonna get them though.

1219
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,220
Then that's your own damn call.

1220
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,220
For the studio.

1221
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,220
And a question mark block.

1222
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,220
Yeah, oh, you should hang it too.

1223
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,220
I'm, we're getting it.

1224
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,220
We're gonna hang the question mark block for the ceiling.

1225
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,140
I'm gonna put a tack and hang the question mark block and then we'll put the mushrooms

1226
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,140
around.

1227
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,740
And then we can put, like, Cartman and some of these other things they see on Justin TV,

1228
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,060
uh, on the mushrooms.

1229
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:49,140
But first we have to fix Justin TV by actually wiring the Mac in because the, the feed on

1230
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,580
Justin TV sucks right now, so we gotta fix that.

1231
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:56,040
By the way, speaking of Justin TV, real quick, did you hear about some of our, um, uh, friends

1232
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,260
over on Justin TV got their stream shut down?

1233
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,340
Take Two put the smack down just for a day.

1234
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,500
They only got a 24 hour ban.

1235
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:05,180
They got some archives deleted, but apparently there was a big crackdown from Take Two on

1236
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,700
people broadcasting Grand Theft Auto 4 and, like, All Games was one of them that got their,

1237
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,820
some of their archives deleted and, cause they were showing the game, you know, they're

1238
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,140
broadcasting the game for, like, two days.

1239
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:18,780
And Take Two did not like that, even though it's free publicity, I guess they just didn't

1240
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,780
like that.

1241
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
That's ridiculous.

1242
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,740
Cause they weren't one of the approved media outlets probably.

1243
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Wow.

1244
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,900
Cause you know those people have the exclusives.

1245
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,900
We had to hide our footage.

1246
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,900
Our footage is still there.

1247
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,900
We had to hide it.

1248
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,900
But we only did, like, ten minutes.

1249
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,900
And it was like-

1250
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,140
And if they had shut us down for ten, I would have thrown a fit because, like, IGN and these

1251
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,940
other sites probably have way more than ten minutes worth of video.

1252
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,300
They're all on YouTube now, too, so it's retarded.

1253
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,900
Although ShadowNextGen in chat says a bunch of YouTube videos were deleted, too.

1254
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,020
That's just stupid.

1255
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,540
Free publicity for your game.

1256
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,540
But see, they're just bullies.

1257
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,660
You know, I would say we should boycott them, but who's gonna fucking boycott Grand Theft

1258
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:52,660
Auto 4?

1259
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,660
We should ignore them, Rob.

1260
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:54,660
Let's stop talking about it right now.

1261
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:55,660
Well, that's fine.

1262
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,660
I'll boycott their other smaller games.

1263
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,660
Good idea.

1264
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,660
You know, they've got the 2K series.

1265
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,460
Well, I don't like sports, so that's fine.

1266
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:06,940
They've got their stupid, what, tennis game, their Rockstar's Table Tennis.

1267
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,260
Fuck your table tennis in the ass.

1268
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,020
I ain't playing that shit.

1269
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:16,640
And then they've got, well, they've got Dora the Explorer, which is shit.

1270
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,060
They've also got, well, they've got Mafia, which is coming out, and Noir, but, you know,

1271
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:28,620
when the fuck are those gonna come out, like, forever, you know, from now?

1272
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,620
That's fine.

1273
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,620
All I buy is Grand Theft Auto.

1274
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,620
That's fine.

1275
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,620
All right.

1276
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,380
Any final thoughts from you, Rice Princess?

1277
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,780
Thank you for being here tonight and giving us a female perspective when DarkSakura was

1278
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,780
unable to.

1279
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,780
You're welcome.

1280
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,780
All right.

1281
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,780
Any final thoughts?

1282
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,420
I'm gonna get myself a banana.

1283
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,140
No one gets that.

1284
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,440
That's all right.

1285
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,140
My final thought is, actually, a fruit salad sounds pretty yummy right now.

1286
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,140
Yummy, yummy.

1287
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,140
Yummy, yummy.

1288
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,140
Yeah, I know.

1289
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,140
I don't get that.

1290
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,140
All right.

1291
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,140
That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundredo.

1292
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,820
If you're here, here on Orange Laundredo, please tell two friends about our show.

1293
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,820
Tell two enemies about our show.

1294
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,820
I don't care.

1295
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,460
Just tell two people about our show, because that's how word of mouth spreads, and more

1296
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:13,020
people everywhere find out about Orange Lounge Radio, and without you and your support, independent

1297
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,020
radio would be dead.

1298
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,100
But thanks to you, it's still alive.

1299
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,060
You know, I heard that, because I've given out our cards during the Zappos.

1300
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:23,140
I was, like, just about to play the outgoing music, but what, what, Loki?

1301
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,900
I was hitting on our cards at the Zappos thing, and they're gonna put it on their little blog

1302
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:27,900
site.

1303
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:28,900
Really?

1304
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:29,900
How nice of them.

1305
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,900
Awesome.

1306
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,900
All right.

1307
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:32,900
Cool.

1308
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,900
We're getting out there a little more.

1309
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:34,900
Woohoo, woohoo.

1310
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,900
All right.

1311
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:36,900
That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundredo.

1312
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,980
Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.

1313
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:43,900
She's not Dark Sakura, but she will be next week, and he's Loki, and Rice Princess helped,

1314
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,900
and we're Orange Laundredo.

1315
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,900
Have a good week.

1316
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,900
