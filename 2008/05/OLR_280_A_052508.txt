Tonight, May 25th, 2008, is Killer Instinct gonna make a comeback?
A new computer chip promises to end piracy forever, and will the 360 go without an update this spring?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
And yeah, we were out last week so we didn't have a show and part B from the week before took forever to get to the podcast feed, but it's all better now.
All better.
We're fixed and ready to go.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'm ready to go tonight.
Hopefully the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also ready to go tonight.
Are you well-oiled and ready to go?
You know, like a machine.
I've had a hamburger.
Does that count?
Sure, that works.
Okay.
Then I'm well-greased and ready to go to the bathroom.
All right.
Sounds not hot.
All right.
Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.
Hello.
And are you well-oiled and ready to go?
Sure.
All right.
You had a Subway sandwich earlier.
How long was that Subway sandwich?
That was like a two foot long sandwich.
It was a foot long, okay.
And it was with the wrong bread because apparently the Subway was out of white bread.
That sandwich was bigger than my foot.
It was not a foot long sandwich.
That was a foot long sandwich.
Alright.
Anyhow.
Sorry.
We are turning into Orange Lounge Foodio yet again.
All right, joining us as well in studio, we have some guests tonight, which is good because we haven't had a lot of guests recently, and I've had to suffer this entire show with only Jamie and Matt.
However, we have some guests tonight to help break that up a little bit.
Joining us all the way from Las Vegas is Tiara.
How are you?
I can has American cheeseburger.
Yes, you can has American cheeseburger.
How are you doing?
I am very good.
I got nauseous on the way here, but now I'm fine.
Sorry to hear that.
You are very, very quiet.
They're having a hard time hearing you, so don't be afraid.
You've got to get that thing real close to your mouth.
Because remember, it's normally wired for Jamie, who can get kind of loud.
All right, yeah, that's right.
I'm just teasing.
All right, well, we're glad to have you.
So you feel free to chime in whenever.
Take Jamie's mic.
I encourage it.
I'm just kidding.
I don't know why I'm giving Jamie a hard time tonight.
I heart Jamie.
She knows that.
Right?
You know that?
I'm going to throw that ferret in the fire.
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Drew Nami.
Rar.
How are you doing, Drew?
I'm rar.
You're rar?
Sorry to hear that.
I like the interactive radio that was going on before the show, by the way.
Here's what happened.
We're live on Justin TV.
We do our cam thing, although I got to tell you, the cam kind of sucks tonight because I dropped...
The Eyesight Webcam, and the audio doesn't work anymore.
Good job breaking it, Zero.
It's having to use the actual audio from that little tiny mic thing on the actual, like if you look at the right side of the Mac, but you can see the little tiny mic thing, that's what it's using.
So our Justin TV is kind of hurting tonight.
But I guess one of our listeners actually saw that you were here and called your phone and got you to leave the room.
Ranma, you fucking suck.
I'd just like to make that known.
But Orange Lounge Radio is interactive radio.
It's the best thing ever because we get to interact with you guys.
We love it.
And you can join us in chat.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com or our chat channel is Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.
or you can always send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
I think we have a pretty full mailbag tonight, though, because it's been two weeks.
So you may not want to send them just yet.
Wait until during the week.
And also our Skype line, which will be open later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But it would not be Orange Launch Radio if we didn't talk about our gaming week.
And since we've got some time to catch up on, tonight's question is, how was your gaming two weeks?
So, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming two weeks?
We played rock band today and I played pinball a lot.
I went to Pinnagogo the weekend before.
How was Pinnagogo?
Because we didn't get to hear about it because we were out that week.
It was hot, smelly, and hot and smelly.
Do pinball players not bathe or something?
I don't know, but this was at Dixon Farm Center of something or the other with Banquet Hall.
Yeah, when most people call Sacramento a cow town, you're actually probably thinking of Dixon.
Moo.
Anyway.
But I did get to play the Black Rose before it went down, and Dan brought his No Fear, and Will brought Judge Dredd, which is not my favorite table, but anyway.
I tried to go back and play some really old stuff and some things I hadn't seen before, but I could not get on Theater of Magic at all.
and no one brought like a medieval madness there was an Adams family there nice but it was by this point it's a lot of machines that I know if I want to play them we know the people who own them so what exactly happens at Pinnagogo you pay money to get in and just play all the pinball you want or is it more of like it's supposed to be like a trade show for pinball enthusiasts
You've got your center area, which is all, in fact, there's actually two rooms.
The main room is where the newer tables are set up.
The one with more, you know, I guess componentry and things.
Then there's an air-conditioned dining hall that has older machines set up in there.
And I'm talking like, you know, 60s, you know, 50s, 60s, 70s machines.
But you basically, they're all put on free play and you pay your convention dues and you run around and, you know,
Frolick Frolick in the hot But around the sides they have vendors set up People who sell old tables that need some work Like a friend of ours got a Space Invaders pinball Nice For like 150 bucks It needs to be shopped really bad Does it have the groovy music from the new soundtrack?
I don't know It should No, probably not It's old Probably not then And creepy looking too Um
There are a couple of machines I did play quite a bit of.
Did they have the Jurassic Park pinball?
That was one of my favorites because the dinosaur would come down and eat the ball.
No.
That was always my favorite.
It had Funhaus, which I hate because that head scares me.
But it had Captain Fantastic.
Captain Fantastic.
Which is the one with Elton John on it.
It was the machine and Tommy.
Oh, yeah.
He's fantastic.
All right.
I have a picture of it.
I'll put it on the cam.
Fantastic.
But I did play, one of my favorite was Black Hole, which the cool thing about Black Hole is that you have an underside that you play under the field and you play it reversed.
Oh, I've seen something like that.
I don't think it was, I think it was like, isn't there a swamp thing or a creature from the swamp or something that has something like that?
An Elvira machine does it.
Okay, okay.
But Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is what's in my house, just has a hologram of...
Oh, okay, now I'm thinking of something else.
All right, that's fine.
But Black Hole's a pretty nifty machine, but Dan finally got to play Black Rose, which is the one I want, which I think is much cooler than the new Pirates of the Caribbean game, which was there, and Family Guy, and Simpsons Pinball Party, which I have.
And no pinbot.
There's a bride.
You know what pinball game I haven't played in forever that I want to play again?
Revenge of the Gator.
That was the Game Boy one.
I know.
That was the first game I ever played with a link cable.
That one was fantabulous.
It was fantabulous.
Overall, it was a really good convention, but we ended up splitting so that we could go to Mary's Pizza Shack.
Nice.
Where we didn't eat pizza.
We ate breadsticks.
And I had a milkshake.
The end.
Alright.
Loki, how was your gaming two weeks?
Well, week one I played pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 because I was attempting to go for 100% by that deadline.
And not to say that I didn't try because I took two days off work, played solid for four days, and still didn't finish it in time.
It just got to the point where it wasn't even fun to play it anymore.
It's fun to play it now, though, but not fun to just do all the side missions and stuff.
And I'm still going to do 100% eventually.
It's just right now I'm like at 86.
So I have to kill all the pigeons and do stunts and stuff like that.
Uh, then I played a little bit of, um, Wii Fit this week, and that's alright.
You know, the balance board, it's not as fun as you would think it would be.
It really, it, I don't know, it's just kind of stupid, some of the games that are on there.
And they're not really responsive, but whatever.
And then, um, tried a little bit of, um,
The Penny Arcade Game, and that was pretty fun.
Wait, I have to ask, when you got on the balance board, did it go, ow?
No, it didn't go, ow.
It's all, you're obese.
Did your wife make fun of you when she was watching you play?
No.
Yeah, she was watching me play, but, you know, I don't know, it was just fun.
But then, you know, it said my Wii Fit age was 38, so I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
Okay.
Tried a bunch of the mini-games on there, like the jogging and stuff.
Apparently, Extifer and my wife said that the female trainer on there has a giant bulge.
Like, she's got a package.
What?
Yeah, apparently the female trainer is carrying some extra equipment.
I don't know.
Kind of weird stuff there.
But, um...
Yeah, pretty much that was my gaming week because that's all I've been really playing.
Multiplayer is still kind of fun.
It's hit and miss though with the accuracy on it because you'll be aiming at someone's head and for whatever reason it really favors if you crouch down when you're firing and stuff.
I don't know.
It's just kind of cheap.
It's not as fun as you would have hoped it but it's not as broken as the PSP version so that's also fun.
Um
That's pretty much it right now.
I'm still trying to get my audio video set up to work so I can record some funny stuff.
We were playing with some people and there's a bunch of skate parks in there and you can take the motorcycles on the half pipes and stuff and do funny things with that.
Just all sorts of weird stuff.
Well, my gaming week, you know, I was kind of sick last week, which you would think I would stay home and play games all day, but I really didn't.
Although I did, you know, it's, gosh, it's been a while since we've had a show.
I mean, you miss a week, miss a lot, because we haven't done a show since WiiWare came out.
Like, that was, like, our last show was, what, May 11th?
And so literally the next day was when WiiWare came out.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, so that was amusing.
Defend Your Castle is very amusing.
It's very slow in the beginning.
You kind of have to stick with it for it to get really chaotic.
And the kind of bummer thing about Defend Your Castle is that once you've kind of upgraded your castle fully, there's not really a lot left to do.
You just have to let it keep getting faster and faster and faster.
But it's only a $5 game and, you know, compared to some of the $5 stinkers on Xbox Live, $5 is a fair price for the game.
I think it would be a fun party game too and it's obscenely simple.
I mean, it's cool to bring friends over and be all, okay, here's what you do.
Pick up the guys with your controller and then throw them up in the air and watch them die.
I mean, that's, what fun is that?
Instant party, just add death.
So yeah, Defend Your Castle is kind of cool.
It's not a game that's going to amuse you on a long-term basis, though.
If you're kind of like a single player looking for some games that are going to keep you involved for a long time, from what I understand, you should probably go with Lost Winds or the Final Fantasy game, neither of which I've checked out yet because I'm out of space on my Wii Drive.
I know that.
Completely out of space.
It doesn't take much.
Jeez.
So, but anyway, I'll save that bitching for another day.
Otherwise, I did check out the Penny Arcade game for a little bit.
I only checked out the demo, so I'm not going to try to give a full review of the game.
But I did laugh my ass off.
Like, I thought the game was very amusing.
The gameplay itself, you know...
I've seen it before, but I was amused.
And I'm sure fans of the comic are going to be insanely amused.
I hear it's short, but you know what?
How much does it cost to see a movie these days?
Like $10 to go see a movie for 90 minutes?
It makes $20 for four hours of entertainment not seem so bad.
I am going to put down the money to buy it when I have a little more time to actually sit down and play it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So otherwise, other games I've played, not a lot of new stuff.
I went back and played some old retro stuff, some old Xbox Live Arcade games.
That's really it.
Tiara, I see you're playing a PSP right now.
What are you up to?
How's your gaming weeks?
What have you been playing?
Well, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP.
It's kind of interesting because I've played the PSX version through so many times.
And it's interesting to see how they've rewritten the script and everything.
Is it supposed to be like an upgrade of the original PlayStation 1, or is it like a whole new story?
Because I never really understood.
This one is the exact same game.
They've redone the translation, and now everybody talks like Thor from Marvel Comics.
Okay.
And some of the cut scenes are now animated, so it's kind of interesting.
Cool.
There's cameos.
Yes.
And there are two new classes that you can get, Onion Night and Dark Night.
And so it's been pretty interesting so far.
I'm only in the third chapter, but so far everything is pretty much the same.
The translation is slightly different, and so since the text is different, I'm sort of thrown off by it because I'm so used to seeing the cheesy old translations.
I was like, when I played Final Fantasy IV on the Game Boy Advance for the first time, I was like, whoa, whoa, this is way different from what I remember on Super Nintendo, because they really dumbed it down on Super Nintendo, but thank heavens they kept you Spoonie Bard in there, that made me happy.
I was like, I had to play at least to that spot, to see like, did they keep Spoonie Bard?
Yes?
Okay.
Yeah, other than that, I bought myself Iron Man for the PSP, and I've been playing that a little bit.
I actually wrote a review for that, and it's in the mailbag, so I'm sure Jamie will read it later.
Nice.
Nice.
and other than that, that's it.
All right.
I noticed your PSP is very shiny, by the way.
You take good care of that PSP, don't you?
You sign on that or something.
It's very, very well kept.
Yeah.
Well, I just got it last month.
That's why.
Because it was like a kind of preemptive tax refund gift to myself.
I know the government's giving me $600, so why not?
Yeah, exactly.
And then I have like my little shield on it.
And so it's, you know, that's why it's shiny.
Very nice.
Isn't it shiny?
Yes.
That's one thing I noticed about the PSP.
It's shiny.
Drew, anything shiny in your gaming week?
Not particularly.
I've been playing some Rock Band today.
Did okay, I think.
Other than that, not much.
I...
Tinkered with La Mulana, but I guess I'm just not that hardcore anymore.
Okay, somebody needs to explain La Mulana with me, because I know we have tons of chatters that are obsessed with this game and have been trying to get me to play, so sell me on La Mulana.
What's so rad about it?
In a nutshell, it's like a recreation of an MSX game.
Obscenely difficult.
It's an action-adventure, and basically the goal is you're like this Indiana Jones-type archaeologist, and you want to discover all the secrets in an ancient city called La Milana.
Unfortunately, almost everything is a trap.
It's not I want to be the guy hard, but it's definitely Battletoads hard.
That would be a great name for a game.
Everything is a trap.
I'm not sure if that would be like, I don't know if you ever saw the movie Cube like that as a video game.
Hypercube.
We were just discussing this earlier today.
Hypercube breaks my mind.
Everything is a trap.
It's a trap.
I like that.
That's a good name.
Add that to our wish list.
I don't know if it's able to add to the OLR wish list because I'm not sure what the game is yet.
That's the point.
You don't know what it is.
Oh, because it's a trap.
Okay.
Okay, yeah, then I approve.
It can go on the All Our Wish list.
And aside from that, I've actually been playing through Metal Gear Solid 2.
I sort of gave up on the game a couple years ago because I suck at stealth games, and now I find I'm actually progressing.
Maybe it's the fact that I'm now playing on Very Easy, but Raiden is not annoying as I thought it would be.
It's kind of interesting.
Isn't it weird when you rediscover games that were out like five years ago?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or like ten years ago in the case when I was really sick and I was at my parents' I was playing Soul Blazer.
Oh, God.
Soul Blazer is awesome.
Soul Blazer is awesome.
Soul Blazer needs to come to Virtual Console for reals.
Like, I don't think this made our show roll tonight, but I understand there was a little bit of shenanigans on the internets this week because I guess Kotaku had posted, we want...
This game, we want Soul Blazer to come to Virtual Console, and somehow that got reported on G4 as Soul Blazer is on Virtual Console.
That was kind of funny.
That was very funny.
But I agree with the guy who wrote it.
Soul Blazer does need to come to Virtual Console, as does Illusion of Gaia, as does Terranigma.
Thank you very much.
Are you going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4 at some point, Junami?
And the 50-hour cutscenes are supposed to be in the game?
Yeah, if I can afford a PS3.
Are you going to be watching Metal Gear Solid?
I shouldn't ask people if they're going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4.
I should say, are you going to be watching it?
No, I'll be busy watching Xenisaga.
Okay.
I'll stick to my Tales of games for now.
I'm stoked for the Tales of Symphonia sequel for Wii.
Soon.
Yeah.
If you're in Japan, you might see it next year.
Yeah.
Anyhow.
All right, let's get to gaming news after we take care of some housekeeping tonight.
First off, sorry about last week.
We weren't here.
We decided we were going to put out Part B of the May 11th show a little late just to kind of spread it out when we realized there wasn't going to be a show last week.
But then it ended up getting out really, really late, and that was my bad.
So sorry about that.
But it is up now, Parts A and B of last week's show.
Grand Theft Auto 4 contest.
If you listened to last week's show, you know that SSJ100Matt won our nomination into the finals for the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest.
I don't know who won yet.
What I can tell you is that it didn't end up being a public vote.
That's not how they did it.
Thank you for watching!
Like, I don't think any of us had, like, any similarities in our list whatsoever.
Like, DarkSakura, I think, had the Chatterbox show on her list.
And Loki had the one with all the dick jokes on his list.
Which one was that?
Was that the Platform Nation one?
Why am I not surprised?
That's because it was the most like a Grand Theft Auto commercial.
No, no, I know.
And what did I have?
I had Video Game Outsiders on my list.
I remember that.
But...
In the end, the only one that actually ended up on all three of our lists was the All Games Interactive one.
So that's what we ended up voting for.
And I don't have the MP3 handy, but it's really great because what they did is they cropped Mayor Young, who's on that show.
I guess he was having one of those I'm all alone on the radio.
Did you ever see Wayne's World when Garth was all alone having to do the show?
No.
I guess Mary Young was having one of those moments and somebody actually remixed it to music and it's hilarious.
He's actually singing like, I am alone on the feed.
It was really funny.
Oh wait, look, I found it, I found it.
Okay, here's the one we voted for to win.
Here it is.
I am alone on the feed and that's all.
It's just me.
I'm alone.
I am alone on the field and that's all.
I'm not going to play the whole thing.
You can listen to their show if you want to hear the whole thing.
But it was really funny, so we voted for it.
Even though, nowhere in there do they ever say it's all games interactive or any of that.
And it really has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto, but it was funny.
You ever see that movie, Shockers, right before the guy's head exploded?
I do know... I don't think we've gotten a single vote so far.
Poor Matt.
The problem is, if it had been... See, we kind of got screwed by how they decided to do the finals, which is fine, because we didn't know how they were going to do it going into it.
We knew it could be anything.
But with a public vote, at least we could have mobilized the OL Army, and I think Matt would have done pretty well.
But the problem with having the other shows vote is I don't think they all listened to Orange Lounge Radio.
I don't think they all listened to the rules of the contest either, because some of those entries, I was like...
and DarkSakura.
Wait, this just in.
Apparently, Bobby Blackwolf voted for our show to win.
So, praise Bobby Blackwolf.
Wait, no one listens.
What do you think this is, the internet?
So we know at least Matt won't get last place.
But see, Bobby probably liked it because Bobby listens to our show, so he got it.
But I doubt the other shows are going to get it.
So we'll see.
Alright.
Moving on, moving on.
Enough.
We'll let you know who actually wins next week.
I do want to give one more shout-out to the All Games crew right now because there's a gal on there who I think we've all met, Jessica.
Have you guys met Jessica?
We've all met Jessica before, right?
I don't know.
I think she was there at E3 one year.
She's the pretty gal who reads the news and all that stuff on their show.
Well, that could be anybody.
Yeah.
Jessica is cool and she actually apparently is like, okay, I did not even know this was going on, but there's this website, Massify.com, where they're actually casting a horror movie online.
Like people made YouTube-ish videos.
You sound like you said a horror movie.
No, a horror, horror movie online.
Well, Jessica was a finalist.
her thing was so popular she was one of the top 20 one of the top 10 girls they had her do a screen test and now she's a finalist and if she wins this she's gonna be in a movie she's gonna be in a horror movie she's gonna be victim number how much?
I don't know.
Apparently, it's like a lead role if she wins this.
That's pretty cool.
That is very cool.
I hope, though, she has a no nudity clause in her contract.
She's a pretty girl.
They'll try to take advantage of that.
So, Jessica, no nudity clause.
You better write that in your contract.
But anyway, if you want to vote for Jessica, we encourage you to Massify.com slash auditions slash 739.
And I think you can only vote till Monday.
Her name is Shantus on the site, so that's how you'll know.
And I'll post that there in chat, so you all can go vote.
You do have to register for the site, and they send verification emails.
But come on, in this day and age, who doesn't have a spam email account that all goes to?
I just registered with my spam email account.
Katamaris Forever in chat says, the ferret will be in it as the slasher also.
Now that's an idea for a horror movie.
Maybe that could go in the everything is a trap game.
Maybe the ferret is the mastermind behind all the traps.
I didn't know the ferret liked Slash.
It would be wonderful.
All right.
Anyhow.
So go vote for Jessica.
Make her happy.
Well, we also want to say we know somebody in a horror movie.
All right.
Again, I just hope they wrote the nudity out because that would be awkward.
Like, oh, hi, Jessica.
I think I saw you naked in a movie.
That's kind of awkward.
All right.
Moving on.
because chicks get naked in horror movies all the time.
So I'm just hoping she pulled a Jamie Lee Curtis and said not going to happen.
All right.
Anyhow, let's get it.
Tiara's very amused by the nudity talk.
Look, if you were cast for a horror movie, Tiara, wouldn't you make them write a no boobie clause in the contract?
Nobody would want to see me naked anyways.
I know, I'm sure there's plenty of boys that would like to see the ta-tas, but, you know.
Yes, because, you know, guys are really selective on the TV.
I know.
All right.
It's like, oh, man.
I got to look at... Moving on.
Gaming news.
We do do gaming on this show once in a while, yes?
I know nothing.
We got a week to catch up on.
Loki, catch us up.
What did we miss from the week of the 11th through the 18th when we were gone?
Absolutely nothing.
Except for the news for last week, including there was a bunch of gaming events that went on.
Lots of stuff that we weren't invited to, of course.
And so we have a few different Gamers Days.
Of course, one we like to talk about, Konami.
They had their Gamer Day recently.
And they announced a few things, including Rock Revolution, their journey back into, I guess...
The Guitar Drum Music Game, you know, because they've never been there before.
It's like, you know, oh my god, they finally arrived.
About time.
But yes, not to be outdone by, you know, some other companies who have put out certain games with drums.
They decided, hey, our drum thing's not going to look like a drum at all.
And it's going to have like six buttons and
We're going to be awesome because we're going to one-up everybody.
So yeah, six drum pads, one kick drum, and it looks like 40 songs with download content planned, as well as the ability to record your own songs in a jam session with eight separate tracks.
Online co-op versus Battle of the Bands mode, and...
a weird drum pad.
We actually have the first confirmed song for the new Konami drum guitar.
What's it called again?
Rock Revolution?
Yeah.
We have the first confirmed song.
No, I missed the bus.
You missed the bus, Konami.
You stole my joke.
You missed the bus.
Konami, you know what this is?
It's the sound of the boat you missed five years ago.
I just can't help but look at this and go...
Wow, that's, I guess, yay?
Yay?
About time that you figured out, oh my god, rock and roll?
I feel horrible saying this about Konami.
I feel really horrible saying this about Konami because, you know, they did kind of start the whole guitar, I mean, they did it.
They're like, but if only we could develop a guitar and drum game.
Can we do that?
And then like two years later...
Oh my god, we had one all along!
Why didn't you tell me?
Years ago on this program, and I think we've all said this, years ago on this program, we said Konami is going to miss the bus by not putting this game out here.
Somebody's going to beat them to it.
And I'll be damned if we weren't right.
And that's how they innovate on it.
They make this really weird looking drum pad that looks like some cheesy toy, and then they like...
I don't know.
I can't imagine how this is going to be.
The US R&D people at Konami are pissing themselves and shooting themselves in the foot.
Well, you know, they got to diversify themselves somehow because now the market's really getting crowded.
I got an idea.
Fix Beatmania.
Beatmania is a great idea.
There are people that are so obsessive about Beatmania.
They're going to miss the bus on that again, too, because there's that whole DJ hero that they're talking about putting out.
Once again, they're going to get beat by these other people.
Doesn't Sega have the US license for Kraken DJ?
I'm not sure, but I could totally see this song in Beatmania.
Everything.
Anyways, so yeah, they announced that game as well as some other games which I'm sure no one has ever heard of.
Hold on, hold on.
AJ Mix asked a really good question in chat.
Does anyone really want Rock Revolution?
What do you think?
I mean, is this something... I mean, I guess the answer is if it's a good game, sure.
Yeah, but that's just like saying I don't really want Guitar Hero 4 either or Guitar Hero World Tour.
Did you cover Guitar Hero yet?
No.
Okay, talk Guitar Hero because I got something I want to add to this.
Okay, Guitar Hero World Tour, which I don't even know why they're calling Guitar Hero anymore because now they've added drums.
They were supposed to be more realistic because now they have two cymbals that are up top, and then they have three drum pads as well.
So you have five, so you're immediately better than Rock Band because now you have one additional drum pad.
and they also have a kick drum as well.
And apparently they're going to be pressure sensitive, so if you hit them harder, the sound's louder.
Yippee.
And then the guitar's changed again, but it's basically just another redesign.
It's still five buttons, all that fun stuff.
And then they also have a song creation mode as well.
And they're promising all the same stuff that Rock Band is delivering with.
and then some.
But Konami missed the bus.
Years ago.
Oh, but it's completely original.
You watch.
Oh, it's a completely original idea.
That's so cool.
Tiger Claw sent a list of what songs are supposed to be in Rock Revolution, and some of it sounds interesting.
I mean, it has Come On, Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot.
Well, the thing about this game is they're focusing on drums.
That's basically their focus is on the drums.
Okay, wait.
Rock Revolution does get some major points right here.
We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister.
That is pretty awesome.
But they're all covers.
That's less awesome.
Anyways, so songs or games that we have never heard of.
Dance Dance Revolution X. Of course, they're celebrating their 10th anniversary.
It's going to be all, you know, re-skinned.
It kind of...
They've got some interesting songs for it so far.
But it's going to be 70 different tracks.
They're going to have a brand new LAN battle mode that's going to allow you to play up against 8 players over LAN.
So, you know, making it competitive.
Although I don't know why you would have 8 people having a LAN party for DDR.
You can create your own workout and fitness program through the workout mode.
They're going to have new characters and enhanced graphics.
And it's still going to use the Damai toy.
Then they're also going to have DDR Universe 3, which is only on the 360 right now.
Also 70 songs with music from the 70s to today.
DJ Mode.
And all this news surprises no one.
It's more DDR.
Look, Loki.
More DDR.
Yeah.
They really haven't innovated there.
And then Hottest Party 2, which, you know, meh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
More DDR on the Wii.
But you can have your Miis now dancing in Hottest Bar 2.
But they showed off Silent Hill.
Silent Hill's pretty cool.
Happy about that?
But that's basically it from... Okay, so music games.
I want to say, wait, real quick on music games.
Okay, I don't have room in my house for all that shit, even if I could afford it.
Here's the deal.
If these companies want to win this little war on music games, seriously, make a peripheral that works with all the games.
Xbox 360 will not have that problem.
I'm not sure about the drums, but with the guitars, one of the things Microsoft makes all the companies play nice with each other.
So if it's got five buttons, it will work the same way.
I didn't buy Rock Band for a reason.
Well, I did buy Rock Band.
I bought Rock Band as a standalone game with a guitar.
I did not buy the whole big box for a reason.
This is the reason.
This was coming.
We all knew it.
Here's the thing, though.
I don't really care.
It's like...
I think rock bands kind of hurt themselves a little bit because now that there's all this download content, and I don't know about a lot of people, but I've downloaded a lot of it, I don't really need another game with 40 songs in there.
Why do I need to buy another game?
Because they're really not going to innovate too much on it.
It's just going to have song updates.
But when you're getting three new tracks each week that you can download, by the time you get to where another game would be released, you already have another game built in.
and the other thing too, which I'm not sure about, you know, Guitar Hero 4 on Tour World or whatever the fuck they're calling it, World Tour.
What about all that download content that you had from 3?
I know Rock Band 2, one of the things that they were talking about is that you're going to be able to use your old download content from Rock Band 1 with the new game.
Kind of like how DDR Ultramix used to do it.
Comments from chat, chat.orangelongeradio.com.
Gerardimo says, wait, me's in DDR.
If you made Loki me in a green suit, would it be like Loki dancing in a tingle suit?
No.
Probably the closest thing you're going to get to it.
Blackwolf is hugging his steel battalion controller, I think making a reference to expensive peripherals.
But seriously, you're crazy if you own Steel Battalion You have to be a certain kind of crazy to own Steel Battalion Right, DarkSakura?
I have no room to talk
But yeah, so it's going to be really hard for these guys to sell.
Because also there's rumors going around now with what GameStop has listed on their website for Guitar Hero World Tour, where it's going to cost like $179.
So essentially like $10 more than Rock Band.
I mean, really, are you guys going to spend close to another $200 to buy... I'm assuming a lot of people out there bought Rock Band and probably...
Bottle of the Peripherals for it, but you know, you did that because now you can use your guitar with Guitar Hero and stuff like that, but are you really going to buy more stuff to...
do Guitar Hero World Tour.
Don't get me wrong, Steel Battalion is a piece of gaming history.
I mean, it's the only controller ever that has an eject button and that makes it all kinds of awesome.
But you seriously have to be all kinds of crazy.
It's just, I don't know, it's going to be really hard with all these games coming out in the holiday.
I don't think some of them are going to do well.
I'm sure Guitar Hero will do well by itself.
Maybe people will just pick up World Tour and maybe do the drums later or something because you can do that or you can
I will buy the game, I will not buy the guitar I will not buy the game if it's not compatible with the guitar I already have I am not buying a new guitar until the one I have is run into the ground
I don't understand why they redesigned the guitar anyways, each time.
All that does is delay the game.
So anyway, enough of Konami's Gamer Day stuff.
Alright, sorry.
Quickly, the rest of last week's news.
Anyways, so other stuff.
We've got... Sony had their sort of Gamer Day.
So there's some stuff coming out of that.
I remember they've got...
They were showing off some of their new games, like Killzone 2 and Resistance Fallen Man 2 and that kind of stuff.
Resistance is supposed to be coming out this fall.
Killzone 2 has been delayed to February because they don't want to compete with themselves, which makes sense.
And then Motorstorm is going to be coming out, of course, also in the fall as well.
LittleBigPlanet, October, and there was a new SOCOM game, Confrontation, I believe, that's coming out to their PlayStation Network in September.
Also, Sega was showing off their stuff as well.
They announced a partnership with Platinum Games, and they're going to be putting out three games in the beginning of this.
One of the games, pretty awesome.
Did they announce Plastic Maracas for Samba?
No, don't care.
Well, that's not Platinum Games, okay?
But they're working on it.
They want to make those, okay?
So right now, the one game, Mad World, which is going to be an ultra-violent game for the Wii.
It's all black and white except for the blood.
All right, I'm interested.
Extremely awesome.
They had a trailer where they're killing people in all sorts of fun ways.
There's another game that's going to be coming out as well.
NudeMaker
Quentin Tarantino
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know, you're just not on the cutting edge of game development there.
This is why we have a podcast on the internet and not a gaming company.
And I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
Reading comments from chat real quick, DJ Morpheus says, then I'll get the Rock Band Rehab expansion that comes when you create your own true Hollywood story.
That would be fun, like Guitar Hero mixed with Heroin Hero.
Good times.
Let's see.
Gerardimo says that there might be maraca sleeves for somebody.
Yeah, that's one thing they're talking about.
If not, there's always third-party companies.
Someone will make it if the demand's there.
One thing, Microsoft did their little Gamer Day thing as well.
They showed off the new Banjo-Kazooie game.
No motion controllers, unfortunately.
No word on what that lips peripheral was or anything like that.
I guess we're just going to have to wait.
And they showed off Gears of War 2, of course.
A little bit more of that.
It looks pretty awesome.
And that, of course, will be coming out this fall.
I'm trying to think if there's anything else cool.
There's some other stuff we'll be getting into later on about Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.
And I also know that the XNA service has been launched but just for the developers.
So people that have a membership to XNA can play the games.
Alright, so it sounds like, because wasn't the community supposed to vote on the games and stuff?
They're probably getting it ready for letting it run a few cycles so that they have some games to go live when they go live.
Yeah.
Alright.
Enough of last week's news.
We're almost 45 minutes into the show.
It's time to get into this week's news.
And speaking of Guitar Hero, we're going to start off with another Guitar Hero story because I swear these music games have been all over the news lately.
It's crazy.
On the PlayStation 3 only, Guitar Hero is going to be getting a free song.
It makes sense because the Xbox 360 got a free Halo song, so why not a free...
God of War song for PlayStation 3 owners.
And that's exactly what they're going to be getting on June 5th.
Except we don't know which song it is.
Just knows that it's a God of War song.
And it probably has a lot of heavy guitar, seeing as it's going to be in Guitar Hero.
So it'll be free.
So it's kind of like Sony's answer to, or I guess you could say, you know, the equivalent of the Halo theme on the Xbox 360 Guitar Hero.
So check it out.
Do we have to?
No, you don't have to.
I mean, if you don't own a PS3, you kind of can't.
I'll check it out.
Then I won't.
I like free but then again Yaris was also free.
That's true.
But I don't see how you can go wrong with a free song.
Free songs are only going to... If a free song sucks, it's only going to terrorize you for three minutes and then it's over.
Unless it's yodeling with, you know, Zither as the accompany.
Yodel Hero.
Where's that?
That's what I want.
How about something that has absolutely nothing to do with music games?
Yodelay, yodelay, yodelay.
Wind it up.
Nothing to do with music games.
All right, nothing to do with music games.
Except for one of these theme songs was used in pop-up music.
Okay.
Um...
Actually, two of my favorite companies ever are getting together to make a fighting game.
I am very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, times infinity happy about this.
We are getting Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
Yay!
So happy.
And for those that have no effing idea what Tatsunoko is...
It is the animation studio that gave us such a wonderful series as, of course, my favorite of all time, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman gave us Kashan, which are actually Ken and...
Tetsuya are both confirmed characters for that.
They're on the test versions now along with Ryu and Chun-Li.
But they're also for... Other things that they gave us was Hurricane Polymer.
Did a lot of the animation for Evangelion.
It gave us... I don't know if anyone watched a lot of Nickelodeon in the mid to late 80s, but they gave us the little bits.
And...
Well, they actually have the Gatchaman music in it.
Anyway, sorry, that too.
but also, and I apologize, I had to use a different source than what you gave me, Rob, because I... That's all right.
What was also sort of hinted at as far as being included in the game is characters from Time Bokan, Hurricane Polymer, Tekkaman, Hakushon Daimo, the Genie family.
So, and anyone else who doesn't know, Go!
Go!
Go!
was Tatsunoko as well, which was Speed Racer for us.
Was it Macross also?
Macross was as well, yes.
Okay, honest question though.
Is this game really going to come out in America?
God, I hope so.
And if not, I'll drive my ass down to Arcade Infinity and play the hell out of it.
Oh, it's an arcade.
Yeah.
Oh, are they putting it out on home platforms at all, they said?
I haven't seen any mention on it.
Hopefully PlayStation 3 because then you can import that bitch.
That's a good point.
However, if anyone wants to see, there are some, okay, don't look for the Famitsu scans, they're crap.
Go actually onto Famitsu's website and look up the images.
I mean, if you do a search for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, you'll find a link to Famitsu's page.
Tron Bon
That would be cool.
Ranma is pretty convinced it's not coming out here.
He says in chat, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom will not happen in the US due to massive licensing issues.
Doesn't mean they won't import it over here.
Never say never, but it'll be import heaven.
Why do you think I said Arcade Infinity?
Because they love Capcom.
Are they still around?
I'm sure they are.
I'm sure they are too.
But keep in mind, what arcade's been getting the big imports for ages?
True.
They even had that weirdo Gundam game.
I mean, hello.
They had Um Jammer Lamy.
I remember playing the Um Jammer Lamy game and I had to... Now, don't get the dirty thoughts out of your mind.
I had to play the game on my knees.
Because it's made for little kids.
So I had to get on my knees to play Um Jammer Lamy, the arcade game.
But the best game that was there was the pancake flipping game.
No, no, no.
Punch Mania.
The tambourine game was my favorite thing ever.
That was the gayest game I've ever played in my life.
It was Samba de Amigo with tambourines and you actually had to shake the tambourine and make these little motions.
It was the gayest thing I've ever done in my life.
Are you sure?
You gay!
If you play a tambourine game, you gay.
I've marched in the San Francisco Pride Parade and the tambourine game was gayer.
I marched behind assless chaps across America and the tambourine was gayer.
Moving on.
The tambourine was gayer.
Microsoft made an announcement and this kind of ruins all those rumors that we had earlier about
motion sensing calibration coming to a spring update.
Well, there is no spring dashboard update this year.
So, so sad.
No update, but there may be some other stuff coming later on that's not involved with a dashboard update.
Oh well.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I guess.
If it ain't broke, break it more.
Before I forget, sorry to interrupt.
I'm linking the Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Fumitsu page in the chat room.
I was so three minutes ago.
Sorry, I had to find it.
I do that all the time.
I wouldn't shut up about the miss the bus.
I didn't miss the bus.
I drive a fucking tank.
I blew up the bus.
Speaking of bus...
I made a new friend last night.
He's actually somebody who's listened to our show before.
He's a friend of a mutual friend.
And we were talking about games we'd like to see on the Wii.
We were talking about the Wii Wheel.
And he said, I know what the Wii Wheel would be useful for.
Desert Bus on Virtual Console.
You go to hell.
You go to hell.
And I was like, that would make that Wii Wheel kind of useful.
Yeah, for, you know, an 18-hour drive in real time.
That is hotness.
Behold hotness.
Behold corn.
Ooh.
Remember RBI Baseball?
Poor Atari.
Apparently the ESRB is listed RBI Baseball, but the developers is Six Degree Games.
So I don't know if it's going to be the same RBI Baseball.
Probably not.
It better be.
That would be kind of rad if it was.
I don't play a lot of sports games, but I remember RBI Baseball.
They really should change their name to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.
Oh, God.
So regardless, the ESRB listed it, so you know it's coming soon, RBI Baseball, to Xbox Live Arcade.
Well, we have some other news regarding Xbox Live Arcade.
Anything that's crap goes.
Microsoft is going to be delisting older Xbox Live Arcade titles that sold small numbers and have a low Metacritic average.
Yaris, please be Yaris.
It was free, so a ton of people downloaded it.
It's attach rates, so it's people that bought the full version.
And unfortunately, since it was a free download, that counts as the full version.
Fuck.
There's a quote by Mark Whitten, who's Xbox Live's general manager, saying we will be delisting older, underperforming titles in order to keep the service focused on a section of high-quality games.
To translate, that means, they're shit, get them off the server.
No, to translate that means our marketplace is insufficient to handle this many games.
So we have to find a way to reduce it.
Because I think that's seriously what it is.
There's too many games in the marketplace because Xbox doesn't present it in a very user-friendly way.
The rest of the quote goes on to say the way this will work is that the title will need to be at least six months old and have a Metacritic score below 65 and a conversion rate below 6% on the service, which means fewer than 6% of the people will have downloaded the demo and actually pay for it.
They say they're also giving a three-month notice before delisting anything.
That's kind of interesting, though, that the critics will have kind of a say.
That's kind of scary, in a way.
I mean, I realize it's got to meet both criteria, but that's still kind of strange to me.
I don't know.
Let's see.
Here's some games that per Metacritic would be eligible for delisting.
Now, granted, we don't know how well it sold through.
Discs of Tron has a 44.
I have to go download that now.
I gotta tell you what, though.
It really isn't... It was better in your childhood, Jamie.
It really was.
Is it at least six months old?
It's getting there.
It's definitely getting there.
Let's see.
What else is under 65 here?
Metacritic.
Mr. Driller Online is a 48 right now.
So Mr. Driller Online would be eligible for the plug pulling.
Let's see.
Rocky and Bullwinkle, 37 on Metacritic.
But that game was shit.
That game was pretty shit.
Tikal, Tikal, Tikwal, 58.
Quick, can you name what that game is?
It's a puzzle game.
What's Yaris ranked?
Bye bye, Yaris!
Euthanize it.
Now here's the thing, TigerClaw also said the other exact thing I was thinking before is that this, Sky, this is also bad because people that bought those games won't be able to re-download them if they ever delete them from the hard drive.
But BlackWolf says that question was asked directly and they said yes, you can still re-download them using the account management interface.
and BlackWolf says they just won't have shelf space anymore, which is kind of a good comparison to make, is that it's like pulling these games off of shelves and putting them in the bargain bin.
They're not selling.
I think these games should go in the bargain bin, honestly.
Yaris was already free.
So they have to pay people to download Yaris.
Which they should be.
There's no amount of money worth downloading yours.
So it's going to be interesting.
I'm kind of curious to see the effect.
I mean, I agree to some extent they need to clean up Xbox Live, but I don't know if I agree with getting rid of games completely.
Sweeping them under the rug and making them harder to find?
Sure.
Spotlighting the games that need to have the spotlight on them because these other crappy retro ports are outdoing them?
You know, Rob, if they're going to clean up Xbox Live, they should probably start with the users.
Well, they have been doing that to some extent recently.
We'll get to more on that a little later.
But for now, let's get back to some more gaming news.
So Xbox, one of the things, and this kind of goes back to people having to re-download games and stuff.
If you've ever had your Xbox 360 crap out on you and you got a replacement, you may find that some of your games don't work anymore unless you're logged in online.
Well now, Microsoft is going to release a tool tied in with Xbox.com that will allow you to fix the digital rights management so that your games are locked to your new console.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Now granted, I got Red Ring of Death three days after I bought my Xbox 360, so I only have two games that do this, but Geometry Wars and Joust were the first two games I bought on Xbox Live Arcade, and whenever I try to play them, if I'm not connected to Xbox Live, they won't work.
So in Geometry Wars, that's a pretty big deal.
I even notice a little bit of lag.
When I go into the game, it's talking to Xbox Live and then realizes I have the retail version, and then suddenly my menu changes to the retail menu.
It all happens within seconds.
So it'll be kind of nice to take those games back.
I know other people have had way worse scenarios where it was more than two games and multiple users in the house.
My console has way more than two games.
So that'll be kind of nice to reset the digital rights management.
We'll see how that works when that comes out.
I will definitely be running it to take back control of those two games.
We'll see.
Um...
Well, you're talking a little bit about rediscovering things that were a little bit old.
And if you've never played Gears of War, it's probably time to come out from under your rock.
And now's a good time, though, because what's going to be happening is that Gears of War is coming out with a brand new re-release, a game of the year edition, if you will.
It's coming out this summer.
It's Gears of War with all the download content included that originally people had to pay for, and it's only going to be $40.
So that's kind of cool.
I won't be impressed because that's a Windows version.
So June 24th is apparently the day this is coming out.
Hey, just in time for my birthday.
And the sixth birthday of Orange Lounge Radio as well.
On the 23rd of June.
That's hardcore.
Yes.
So if you haven't played Gears of War, you can check that out.
But I think, honestly, most people that would enjoy Gears of War have probably already played it.
So this does seem a little bit late.
But there's a lot of people that are just now getting Xbox 360s too, you know.
As the price comes down and more people get HDTVs and want to spend their stimulus checks and yada yada yada, there'll be an audience for this.
It won't be a huge audience, but there'll be an audience for this.
One thing, though, that I think is going to work out better for everybody who has an Xbox, and it's about damn time, and I think that we all saw it happening, is that Xbox Live Arcade is going to be changing their limit from 150 megabytes to 350 megabytes, and it's been made official, especially since we've got Soul Calibur coming out.
They're really trying to get me to upgrade to that 100GB hard drive already.
Because I only have a 20GB drive still that I've just been making work.
I had to finally uninstall Final Fantasy XI to get the room.
Well, the price limit of Xbox Live Arcade games has actually also been raised to 1600 points, which is about 20 bucks.
Developers, you better make darn sure your game's worth it.
I mean, the Penny Arcade game, they'll get it for that.
And it's, you know, it's pretty cool.
Again, I haven't had a chance to give it a full review yet, so I can't say for sure if it's worth the 20 bucks, but it seems like it will be.
We shall see.
Mm-hmm.
Interesting, though, that they're... Why do they even have the limits in the first place?
I guess they don't want people to go crazy, but I think, you know, when you... Well, yeah, the original Xbox games are, like, one or two gigs.
Well, originally they wanted to make sure that people that did not buy hard drives were able to put at least one game on their memory unit.
Well, you know... Well, now their memory units are 512, so now they can do 350.
I don't know, it's stupid, but yeah.
Or they could just do 512.
Or, I don't know, buy a hard drive like everybody fucking else, okay?
Seriously.
Exactly.
Um...
So, this is not a big surprise.
I mean, the game that did so well.
Eventually, of course, it would be coming to the PlayStation 3, but Bioshock is officially coming to the PS3.
It has been rumored to be coming for a while now, and it will be due out this holiday.
And apparently, the port they claim is going to have slightly better graphics, some additional game content.
We'll have to see, I guess, when it comes out.
S.T.A.R.S.
Well, this week there's not a whole lot coming out.
Pretty much the big title is going to be Enemy Territory Quake Wars on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Also on the Wii this week, we've got Death Jr.
I don't know.
I don't know if I get too excited about DeathJunior game.
But yes, brand new DeathJunior.
Well, actually, I wouldn't say it's brand new.
It's a remake coming to the Wii.
There's also Emergency Heroes, which is just like Emergency Mayhem, both sort of like Crazy Taxi.
And I don't know.
That's going to be coming out to the Wii.
And then this week is, I believe, Super Dodgeball Brawlers, which was a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Metallic Rose DS Lite
Also... I saw a commercial on TV for the Metallic... I don't... Well, I think she was playing a Metallic Rose or a Pink DS, but it had Carrie Underwood playing Nintendogs on the DS.
I don't even remember what show I was watching that.
Did her dogs run away from her because that'd be funny?
No, they didn't.
She was giving them a bath and giggling, although I bet it wasn't even her playing the game.
They just had her posing with a, you know, empty DS.
Um...
and DarkSakura.com.
Also on the PC, Mass Effect is finally coming out, so you can play that as well.
Dracula Origin on PC.
If you want to shop at GameStop, there's the USA Today Crosswords Challenge, which is a GameStop exclusive.
Woo-wee!
That's one hell of an exclusive.
That's put out by Destineer, who makes only good games, I'm sure.
Oh, wait, no, they don't.
And then...
And then that's pretty much it.
Oh, World Championship Cards.
That's right.
It's card games that aren't poker or blackjack.
Like Solitaire.
Awesome.
Oh, and there's a game called Bus Driver for the PC by Got Game Entertainment.
As long as Bus Driver has an awesome theme song, that would be cool.
I think we all know the theme song already.
Ranma's accusing me of watching Lifetime again.
No, there haven't been any Lifetime movies recently that I've been interested in watching.
Although I think there's a new one coming out that has, well, forget it.
Lifetime because men are evil.
And it makes me so embarrassed to be a man.
The DarkSakura story.
Rob.
What?
I have no secret shame.
My shame is very public because I go to it once a week.
This certain little garage studio.
Very, very public shame.
Rob.
What?
What?
They totally should make a Lifetime Movie of the Week about Jamie's life.
Who would play Jamie?
That's the question of the day.
We need an Instapoll in chat.
Who would play Jamie in her Lifetime Movie of the Week?
Someone who's sufficiently bitchy.
So I'd say Ella Izadushku because I don't want to, you know, look like myself.
Well, I don't know.
Christina Ricci.
She's not really a celebrity, but she's a TV celebrity, I guess.
But that one chick, Mary Alice from Ace of Cakes.
That would work.
I don't watch TV.
Janine Garofalo about 10 years ago.
I like her.
I would approve of her.
She's sufficiently bitchy.
Jamie Summers as herself, says Actdeft.
Margaret Cho, says Dark Tensuya.
Hi, I'm not Korean.
I look nothing like Margaret Cho.
Margaret Cho is gorgeous, but no.
Ranma says my best friend, Patty.
Tina Fey as Jamie.
Oh, that's a good one.
Tina Fey is the gal with, she was in Mean Girls.
She was the teacher with the glasses and everything.
I have to look this up now.
Look her up.
I like, that's a good one.
That's my favorite so far.
Ew, Rachel Ray.
That's wrong.
Instant ban.
No, I'm just kidding.
Oh, I know who this is.
I have a friend who has a picture of her with genius on it.
Tina Fey is cute.
I like her.
All right.
Anyhow, release dates over in Japan.
Coming on the Xbox 360, Battle Fantasia comes out as well as Lost Planet Colonies and Overlord all coming out on May the 29th in Japan.
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, another port of Battle Fantasia.
I'm not exactly sure what Battle Fantasia is.
Battle Fantasia just sounds awesome.
It's like a fighting game.
Is it really?
But it's pretty cool looking.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, it's by Arc System Works.
Go figure.
Be familiar with the... Oh, they did Guilty Gear.
Guilty Gear and Fist of the North Star.
Alright, so there you have it.
So that game's coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard 4 Wii Edition.
You might know that as Resident Evil.
They call it Biohazard overseas.
Family Trainer Athletic World with Matt.
Please note that is not Wii Fit, but a cheap knockoff.
On the PlayStation 2, hey...
Remember Beatmania 2DX?
Remember that game?
Uh, what?
Remember that game?
The 14th edition Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold finally hits the PlayStation 2 on May the 29th.
I should get that.
I kind of want it too, just for old time's sake.
I actually want Happy Sky just because it says Happy Sky.
Burnout Revenge Death Jam Vendetta
because Japan needed their Def Jam Vendetta.
Fatal Fury Battle Archives is coming out on the PlayStation 2 on May 29th.
Fushugi Yugi gets some new games coming out.
That series, yeah.
Suzaku Ibun.
No, she's still writing books.
uh Medal of Honor lots and lots of stuff coming out on the uh by the way there is a Konami style special edition for a Beatmania 2DX 14 gold it probably comes with stickers and a bunch of useless crap uh Beatmania 14 gold poster oh Beat Nation LEDs album and puzzle pieces and Beatmania 2DX premium live DVD the Beat Nation Summit that'd be cool that'd be kind of cool
I don't know.
I don't have the love for B-mania that I used to have.
I think I got really disappointed that they gave up on it in the U.S.
I was really disappointed they gave up on it here.
They could have done a lot better.
Well, their biggest advocate left the company.
I guess that's true, too.
On the Nintendo DS, 13 Sai no Hello Work DS, Front Mission 2089, Border of Madness, another Sudoku game.
Front Mission's awesome.
Zombie Shiki, Yogo Ryoku Soshi Jutsu, English of the Dead.
Oh, good times.
That sounds like an interesting list.
I know, it sounds like another game I'm thinking of.
On the Sony PSP, I always thought this was a pretty bitchin' band that Enya used to be in, but Clannad, it comes out on the Sony PSP.
It was Enya's sister.
Was it Enya's sister?
Yeah.
Clannad, let's see.
What is this about?
Oh, God, it's from this company that makes dating sim games.
Clonod has gone from Enya's sister to Dating Sims Memories Off and Valhalla Nights 2 all those are your Japanese release dates after a pretty slow month in Japan that's good that you guys are getting a lot of stuff this week so congrats Japan is a winner this week well honestly I'd have to say that for the UK releases the winning week had to have been last week so I do want to go ahead and mention a few things that are already out that people should be getting or should have
and if they don't have Silent Hill Origins already I'm going to cry but Dr. Mario and Germ Busters out on Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, My Life as a King, Lost Ones, Star Soldier R those are all really good and the Penny Arcade game too is actually on the 21st now what we have coming out for this next release period oh and by the way they got Rock Band like all the good stuff is already out so I don't see what the point is
Death Junior, Root of Evil, Dream Pinball, Enemy Territory Quake Wars, Monster Madness Gravedigger, Pool Party, Race Driver Grind, Supreme Commander, Codename Panzers Cold War, and Jamster All-Stars.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Nothing yet.
That's it.
Alright.
Let's get back into some gaming news.
Metal Gear Solid 4, I made a joke earlier about the long cutscenes, but it's really not a joke.
Some of the cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4 are apparently up to 90 minutes long.
The good news is you can pause them.
And that might be an exaggeration.
Yeah, also the news came out this week that that might be a slight exaggeration that it's not really 90-minute cutscenes.
But I would bet it's probably like Lost – because Lost Odyssey had some fucking long cutscenes in it.
But they were broken up like a little bit, like little bits here and there it was broken up.
So it's probably the same type of deal Metal Gear Solid 4 where you play for a little bit.
Yeah.
Well, some other Metal Gear Solid 4 news is that Kojima is going to be in London signing sleeves.
So, the release date is actually the 12th of June, and he is going to be around signing, let me see if it's going to be where he is, at HMV's Oxford Street London store on the 2nd of June to sign the copies, so...
It's also not just Kojima, but Yoji Shinkawa is going to be there too.
And there's 300 sleeves available from the store on the day of the event, and it starts at 9 o'clock a.m.
So I will personally give whatever listener who gets me one a shout-out and my undying affection.
And I'll send you clippings from the ferret.
Just so you know, they are just like sleeves.
It's not actually the game that he's signing since, you know.
That's why I said sleeves.
Wait, you're going to shave the ferret?
I said clippings.
Like maybe part of its butt hair.
Shave the ferret.
That sounds like a mini game in WarioWare.
Shave!
That sounds dirty, Rob.
you're gonna shave the ferret earlier Jamie and I were talking about OLR the RPG and you know how like Final Fantasy has like the Tetra Master card games instead of the card game you could have shave the ferret the minigame inside of the OLR or that could be like the first quest because you know the first quest is always something pointless to introduce you to the game's mechanics I think the first quest should be like having to take the ferret out for a shave
I was actually wanting to make a contest about whoever wanted to take RPG Maker or something and actually make an OLR RPG, like a full-fledged RPG.
I'd be right.
That would take a long time.
Exactly.
It would take a long time.
Well, personally, I was going to talk about... Well, they should have... You know that game coming out, Blastworks?
The entire game is totally customizable.
We can make our own levels and stuff like that.
Plus, they have a website that you can upload it all to and you can download it, so...
There's a little bit more, though, about getting the sleeves.
They're not just giving them out.
You will get a sleeve if you pre-order the game at HMV, and the deposits for the game is five pounds.
Five pounds?
Five quid.
All right.
Good lord, that's a lot of pounds.
an NFL in just one play, UMD, a voucher to download the game Beats off the PlayStation Store, and a 1GB memory stick.
And the knowledge you play too many sports games.
I think it's kind of funny though that they include Beats on there, but hey, more power to them I guess.
But that is coming August 12th.
Yet another PSP bundle.
You know, our old friend of the show, Shane, is going to get this bundle simply because the PSP is blue.
It's kind of sad.
Is he going to put high school musical stickers all over it?
Probably.
Resident Evil 5.
This game looks hot.
I don't know if you've seen the screenshots.
This game looks awesome.
It's got that whole over-the-shoulder thing from Resident Evil 4, but it's now on next-gen systems.
and a hot game even gets hotter.
Apparently, Resident Evil 5 is going to be featuring cooperative play mode, and that means you can play co-op throughout the campaign.
There's going to be also cover system mechanics in the game, so you can actually lock to a wall and then fire around corners.
If you're not actually playing in co-op mode, the other character in the game will be controlled by the AI.
That's kind of interesting.
There's also going to be dodging that is done by the right analog stick.
And apparently the game is in these more open areas.
So this game sounds pretty awesome.
All this information, by the way, comes from an article that was on GamesRadar but got pulled.
And you know what it means when articles get pulled.
They were true the whole time.
Trust us.
People die?
No, that too.
People don't die.
They just get threatened and bullied a lot.
Again, trust us.
We know.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
They get taken out in the back alley.
Beat up a little bit.
Well, there's something else that should make some people happy, too.
So if you get threatening letters from Capcom, you can go hide in another series, which is Oddworld.
I know that there are fans of this series.
I have not played them, but I know a lot of people who love the Oddworld games.
Oddworld games.
And so the co-founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, said that he's working on another Oddworld game.
It will feature new animation... Sorry, I got really mad.
I decided to shoot Loki.
Oh, okay.
Ow!
His foot hurts again.
I was loading something in advance because I tried to work in advance.
Yeah, your gun.
Yes, I was loading my gun.
Can I finish reading now?
Christ.
Alright, yes you can.
Sorry.
I didn't mean for that to happen.
Yeah, right.
Anyway, they're saying that basically the visuals are going to be about the same as what you'd expect in a good CGI feature film.
The quote says, from Braun, the rendering tools are getting so good now for 3D animation that you can literally create a linear animation and create a video game using the exact same objects.
That's pretty cool.
So, I might have to check this one out myself, but they're basically saying that it could be a few years before the project's complete.
They're also saying, though, the hint is that the Oddworld games to be released in the future are going to be episodic.
So, that's kind of nifty.
Alright.
It worked for Sam and Max.
Well, speak of episodic... It did not work for Shenmue.
Well, speaking of episodic content...
Horlore, you may remember them of the World of Warcraft.
Apparently they got sued so they had to change their name.
But Horlore, the fantasy porn series that's out there now that is based off of World of Warcraft.
Now they're branching off into a new online game to parody, I guess, in porn.
And that would be the Age of Conan with their brand new series, Horlore Presents, The Rage of Bonan.
And it will actually...
Feature the first episode.
Lots of boning.
Well, lots of boning.
But yeah, the first episode is apparently going to be a recreation of one of the missions that you go on in the beginning of the game, where you have to rescue some chick who is apparently tied up and then, except in this, they have sex with her, so...
Uh, interesting, but I mean, you know, they have some pretty interesting, uh, names for their episodes and stuff, like the first one, I remember Horlor, or, you know, World of Horcraft, the first one, Rogues Do It From Behind, gotta love that, and then, Pirate Booty, actually.
Yes, but if you're interested and you're of age, you can download these and purchase them at horlor.com.
You know, I was just thinking, it's been a while since we've had a video game porn crossover story because, you know, I was just, don't ask me why, but I was thinking the other day about Final Fuck X and how hilarious that porno was.
Have you ever seen Final Fuck X?
This is great.
Remember Dansan's fuck?
It's basically boning some cosplayers.
Yes, it's basically Japanese porno, and it's basically these girls are dressed up like Yuna and Riku and Lulu, and they get fucked.
I don't think it's the final fuck, though.
I think the title's a little deceiving.
Yay for Lulu.
I have a feeling they get fucked again in the sequel.
And in case you haven't ever seen these before, they do have pictures online, and they do have the elf ears, too.
So it's like a...
You know, fanboys.
They're very, very great costumes.
No, seriously.
It's just very, very smug.
It's very, very good cosplay.
They just get fucked.
In OLR history, I remember one week when we reviewed Dance Dance Fuck live on air because you actually got this porno somehow.
I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay and I saw some like, I gotta buy this.
Rob.
There's actually a porno called Dance Dance Fuck, but they don't actually ever play Dance Dance Revolution.
No, it has the font, and then it's like Dance Dance... These para-looking girls.
Dance Dance Fuck, like, six max or something.
Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck six max or something like that.
It was so funny.
Until you've seen live-action Smurf porn, you ain't seen shit.
All right.
But anyways, this company also, just so you know, they do have the first FPS porn as well.
They have FPS porn episode one, and it is done in the style of an FPS shooter.
One has to wonder what the gun is.
Eight bucks.
It's not bad.
Very nice.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, oh, oh, real quick, sorry, and I forgot to add one thing.
You're interrupting his bouncing.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
In the Age of Conan, they actually have a guild for Horlor as well, and if you want to sign up for their guild for Age of Conan, it's horlorguild.com.
So yes, you too can be part of the Horlor.
Nice.
All right.
Anyhow, I said happy music.
You're meeting G over there
Even the little gaming thing's voice sucks.
but Typing of the Dead is a modification of House of the Dead 2 which is a first person rail shooter except in this one phrases and words pop up and you have to type them to kill them I've played an arcade version of this, it's quite difficult since I'm not too familiar with a Japanese keyboard but I have the Dreamcast version of this game
I like that, um...
When they're walking around, they have Dreamcasts on their back and keyboards in front of them instead of carrying their guns around.
Unless you play the PC version.
Yes, you can on GameTask.
PC versions kind of ask, but... Hey, but it's all I got.
Yeah.
I can bring over my Dreamcast one day.
But anyway, Typing of the Dead was just really fun.
And it's so just... Go away!
I guess a good, it's just absurd, basically.
It's stupid, but it's really fun.
And on top of that, it has the worst voice acting ever, which makes it even better.
My god.
I was like, there was nothing we could do.
It's that epic.
I don't want to die.
I remember playing a game like this once at Arcade Infinity.
I don't know if it was still typing in the deck.
No, the one they had was typing in the deck.
But it was in Japanese?
Yeah.
Okay.
But it was the same game, just in Japanese?
Well, the first few levels, if I do recall right, were mostly in English.
But it was as you get to boss battles that they were using the... Yo, you could type...
because they used English letters, it was just the Japanese words, so you could type it and you could play through the game, but when you got to the boss, there's one boss that asks questions.
Yeah, that was it.
And that was the part where you always got screwed.
So there you have it.
I also like that if you look at how House of the Dead has little kids that you can shoot and find, well, they actually pop up as letters.
That is cool, I like that.
I freaking love Typing of the Dead.
I think it's about time this game got some respect.
Alright, so there you have it.
Typing of the Dead, your classic game of the week.
Available on Dreamcast, which is the preferred version for Jamie.
Or PC, if you must.
Everything is better on Dreamcast.
Alright.
Very good pick.
Again, I'm surprised that that has never been picked before.
Well, I haven't been doing this that long.
I know, I guess so.
But there you go.
Basically, you want to know how we came across it?
How we decided to?
Because we went in the vault.
Ah, went in the vault.
Tiara's nodding her head.
Did you make Tiara go in the vault?
Yeah.
Tiara's like, I was in the vault.
It was dark.
It was cold.
They tried to lock me in the vault.
They locked me in the vault.
I grabbed a stack of games and just kept going through them.
Yeah, I did, and it was fun.
But I kept going through them until I found Typing Dead.
All right.
There were other games there that I might do later.
Thanks for watching!
and movies.
Lots of game movie crossovers.
And yes, the whole Xbox shenanigans around the guy whose name happened to be kind of gay.
We'll talk about that all in Part B after a quick break.
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
