449	5515	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5876	14726	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15426	19070	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19943	21466	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
32671	39873	3-day weekends in OLR world usually mean that we're going to get drunk for Sunday nights, but not this year.
40373	42094	It's kind of a downer.
42954	43314	Why not?
43554	46175	Well, Loki had to drive here, and of course you're not going to drink and drive.
46195	46815	That's not okay.
47296	51277	And DarkSakura, she's entertaining company, so she doesn't want to be passed out while company is here.
51797	57059	And me, I'm not allowed to drink medically right now because of everything I have with my pancreas.
57099	59940	I might have to stay away from alcohol for a long time.
60420	60960	But that's okay.
62321	64163	You don't need alcohol.
64223	67747	Alcohol's fun when done responsibly, but you don't need it.
68207	69148	So, Olive.
69669	74394	But I do need Olive Garden, so I hope I can eat something besides vegetables again soon.
75195	75616	We'll see.
75996	78218	Those of you playing the drinking game at home, take a shot.
78479	78759	Why?
78939	80321	Why do they take a shot?
80641	81162	Olive Garden.
81942	82223	Alright.
83323	89626	Anyhow, we're going to get back into the gaming news here on Part B. If you missed Part A, you should go back in the podcast feed and listen to it.
89666	95769	Unless you're listening live on Sunday, then unless you can rewind time, you're just going to have to wait for Part A to hit the podcast feed, which should happen soon.
96069	99110	But in the meantime, Wii News, Loki.
99391	101832	Yes, we didn't get this game over here.
102952	107573	They had a music game in Japan that translated to Band Brothers.
108434	117976	Also in Japan, they will be getting a brand new sequel to that game, which is entitled Band Brothers DX.
118036	126218	It will allow players to stream their best performances to their Wii for output through TV speakers, stereos, and home theater systems.
126318	127779	To accompany this,
128439	138403	We are getting a new channel called The Speaker Channel, which will allow you to do such things as that.
139443	140343	That's pretty interesting.
140643	147346	Also, I guess the Band Brothers game, the original one, is due out for the U.S.
147386	149366	as well, called Jam with the Band.
151147	154848	Or at least it was, but now I don't know if that's still coming out.
155408	156749	What if I don't want Jam with the Band?
158917	160257	What if I want to dance with myself?
160657	161478	But thou must.
163399	163739	I don't know.
164199	166600	So, it looks neat, I guess.
167060	168001	It sounds interesting.
168741	170662	Do you think it's something we might ever get here in the States?
171002	172103	Yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.
172743	174344	Nintendo likes releasing stuff here.
175456	176217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
192569	194590	Mega Drive had a game in Japan only.
194630	196331	It was called Glaylancer.
196872	197832	Not gray, that's glay.
197872	198773	G-L-E-Y.
198853	202335	Glaylancer came out, and that's supposedly going to be coming out here soon.
203015	208519	Konami had a game on the NES called Biomiracle Bakute Uppa.
209139	209960	I was gonna say yay!
237339	237739	Oh, you were?
238220	238380	Yeah.
238400	240361	I thought you were going to complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.
240901	243562	I was going to say yay and then complain it wasn't Shinobi World.
243582	244263	Alright, sorry.
244303	244783	My bad.
244943	245864	God, Rob.
247124	250066	So you can play... What's that game?
250186	251166	It's not Rock Paper Scissors.
251186	252407	What do they call it in Alex Kidd?
252667	253448	Jankenpon.
253528	254228	Jankenpon.
254528	258450	You can play that to your heart's content in Alex Kidd Miracle World.
258490	259031	Coming soon.
260932	261672	But now more news.
263035	264416	Product Placement Done Wrong
286667	291389	There's this huge, massive Wii Fit, you know, humongoid thing.
292229	296631	And it's right over Chevy's in Times Square.
298531	301472	But isn't it healthy because it's like fresh mix and stuff?
301492	302313	Yeah, it's fresh mix.
302353	306994	You can have a big fucking burrito and a big fucking margarita as big as your head.
307394	309015	It's exactly what I said earlier.
309375	311936	And you could be healthy because you'll go home to Wii Fit.
312783	315284	You won't care because you'll go home drunk and off.
315324	316124	Ain't it grand?
316284	320125	As long as I have a salad and bottomless chips and salsa, I'll be fine, right?
320565	320745	No.
321385	322725	But it's a salad, Jamie.
322745	323905	But I have to tell my Chevy story.
323925	326046	With avocado and sour cream, I'll be fine, right?
326086	326506	Sour cream.
326626	328926	Orange Lounge Radio is nowhere sponsored by Chevys.
330067	331127	I have a Chevy story, though.
331787	332407	All right, real quick.
332787	334448	Since we are Orange Lounge Foodio.
335308	336628	I ordered a margarita.
336648	337708	It was a prickly pear margarita.
337748	339349	And I ordered a small one so you know it was massive.
340409	341649	And they spilled a third of it.
342347	343628	Oh no, so I had to give you another one.
344108	344448	No.
344688	344928	What?
345189	347170	They refilled that third with tequila.
348610	358976	And I'm eating my seafood fajitas, which is probably the thing I get every time I go there, drinking down this hefty, and you know me and tequila on top of that.
359756	362798	You know, let's just, you know, it's like Drew said earlier, waffles.
363777	365139	Waffles, waffles, waffles
380489	384351	Well, A, I just saw Guardian Legend on my TV, so I got distracted for a minute.
384551	385172	Shiny.
385472	388294	Loki's playing with all these things you shouldn't be on the Wii right now.
388314	388594	Sorry.
389835	390955	It's very distracting.
391055	396218	From here on, I'm going to associate Wii Fit with Chevys and therefore margaritas, so whenever I think of Wii Fit, I'll get drunk.
396418	396959	I'll tell you what, though.
396999	398480	I think the product placement is working.
398500	402122	I mean, maybe not this particular case, but you can't find Wii Fit anywhere right now.
402462	403683	I missed launch day.
403743	407965	I slept through it or whatever, and I didn't get the game when it came out, and I'll never get it now.
408666	409046	Right, Loki?
409066	409146	Yeah.
409744	410184	Probably.
410244	415148	It's in short supply right now because those Wii Balance boards are fucking hard to manufacture.
416208	424714	I was in GameStop in Las Vegas a few days ago, one of the most obese cities in the nation, and there were like 75 Wii Fit boards.
425574	427536	Just sitting there, it was like they couldn't get rid of them.
427596	427956	Damn it!
427976	428957	Please take these!
429645	431145	Damn it, I'm shopping in the wrong place.
431165	432766	Because people are like, money?
432886	434026	I have to gamble that away.
434586	437347	See, Kikoman2DX in chat says Wii Fit is in Costco.
437667	439688	I was just at Costco today, and no it wasn't.
439728	440548	I looked.
440568	443429	I mean, maybe in your neck of the woods, but not mine, sadly.
444789	451391	In regards to Wii Fit, just a little reference to the hardcore old school computer nerds out there.
451791	452872	Two words spring to mind.
453112	454412	Guru meditation.
455172	456333	Imagine that on the Wii Fit board.
456353	457473	How about dance aerobics?
459878	460999	That's old school for you.
461039	461919	Dance Aerobics.
461939	463841	Remember that game on the NES for the power pad?
463901	465862	Yeah, Dance Aerobics was hardcore.
466723	470285	Well, don't they have something like that coming out in Japan from Namco?
470325	472166	It's got a little power pad thing.
472767	474628	Dude, they could do it with real music now, too.
474648	481272	They don't need those crappy little... Well, not that NES music was crappy, because it wasn't, but they could actually have real songs in it and stuff.
481532	482813	I could work out to Britney Spears.
482873	483314	It'd be fun.
484114	485235	Well, it would be fun.
486820	487340	For a minute.
489442	489982	For a minute?
493145	506896	This game may not be Wii Fit and it certainly is not Dance Aerobics but coming to WiiWare soon is a game that is probably just as important and that would be the official beer pong game.
508807	509688	Just what I needed!
528513	530254	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
557145	558967	Why would you be playing beer pong?
559107	561829	Frat party games in preparation for being 21?
561889	564692	There's no point!
566894	578585	So no word on when it's going to come out or how much it's going to be, but I can tell you right now Or how drunk you won't get playing it Yeah, how drunk you won't get I feel totally wasted right now
578991	579612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
595692	600097	It's Spinal and Orchid and Glacius.
600177	600717	Was that his name?
602539	603720	Combo Breaker.
603740	606863	Combo Breaker and all those characters that were in Killer Instinct.
607224	609766	And I'll be damned if this rumor doesn't come up once a year.
609846	610367	It's back.
611007	613570	And it's thanks to EGM and the Quarterman.
613710	615192	He always has us call him an EGM.
615792	616393	Apparently...
616873	621980	Rare is going to be making a third entry in the Killer Instinct franchise.
622260	625964	Of course, Rare's denied this before, but apparently there is a game in the works.
626065	629789	Killer Instinct 3D, Death, Destruction, and Doom.
630190	630770	Get it?
630810	631111	3Ds.
631231	632492	Death, Destruction, and Doom.
633253	634475	It's apparently on the Xbox 360.
634515	636017	Will she still have the boob attack?
636357	636777	I hope so.
637038	637538	Yes, please.
638318	643722	Apparently, though, it will not be using the pre-rendered stuff that was seen in the previous games, which is kind of a bummer.
644002	648986	It'll just be 3D visuals and more robust gameplay, whatever that means.
650047	650807	Bigger bus!
651147	651788	Yay!
651808	652528	Bigger bus!
653669	656551	Because Maya had some pretty big busts.
656571	660294	I don't know if you saw that, but that was a combo breaker of a different kind.
660614	662615	It should be more mobust replay.
663516	663776	Yeah.
663836	664957	Ultra combo me any day.
667650	668091	I don't know.
669031	673234	Take with a giant grain of salt, but I don't think any of us would complain if this were true.
674835	675075	Right?
676015	676596	I know I wouldn't.
676956	682239	You know what they should do when there's a game that's being announced that everyone's been rumoring for it to come out for a long time?
682259	685501	They should send everybody in the press a giant grain of salt.
686862	687403	That would be hilarious.
687423	688823	That would be fun.
688863	689344	Good idea.
690284	690825	I need a moment.
690845	691685	My browser just died.
692025	692346	Uh-oh.
693186	694507	So we can't get to the next story now?
695640	696321	I'm all over it.
697021	697702	What are we going to do?
697722	701104	The show is collapsed.
702425	704207	Quickly then, some more discussion.
704267	706649	Things you would most want to see in Killer Instinct 3.
707469	709751	What do you think Killer Instinct 3 needs more than anything?
710011	710412	Jumblies.
712013	712973	Banjo-Kazooie.
713874	714355	No, it does not.
714375	714875	Okay, it's up.
720105	726706	There are supposed to be new colors for the DS in Europe if anyone gives half a crap.
730527	732888	Puke green, according to Tiara.
734969	739030	There is... I like how the article said slime green.
739110	740550	That's actually lime green.
741170	742811	Hot red and ice blue.
743871	746872	And it's supposed to have dates of June 13th.
748993	752675	Hot Red, Ice Blue, Lime Green, American Gladiators
768471	770312	One of those shows that's so bad, it's good.
770572	772593	I watch American Gladiators every week.
773333	773913	Good times.
774073	774493	You would.
774894	776194	I love American Gladiators.
776494	777355	It's great.
777675	778655	I hope they make a new game.
779315	783177	All I have to say is that in the previews, Atlas Sphere is coming back this year.
783197	784217	Thank God.
784317	784797	By the way.
784837	785317	Thank God.
785537	785738	What?
786118	786798	My man won.
787858	788479	I am pleased.
789059	790679	The old American Gladiators season one?
790719	791420	No, American Idol.
791440	791820	Oh, American Idol.
791840	792380	American Idol.
794209	795251	David Archuleta's dad would have an aneurysm.
806042	808463	Are we really having American Idol talk on the show right now?
808523	809943	I'm not having this discussion.
809963	811324	Okay, I'm done.
811384	811824	Next topic!
812284	816525	So, yeah, something I've been distracted by lately.
817866	820847	The Wii Homebrew channel has been released.
821427	830050	Yes, they've gotten it so bad now to where they can inject their own channels into the Wii, and it's just insane the amount of stuff that you can do now.
830350	832651	Emulators, games...
834031	838072	You name it, it's available and hopefully I'll be demonstrating it a little bit later.
838112	839253	But yes, it is available now.
839333	845115	You can install it using the Twilight hack, which is actually pretty interesting the way it works.
845215	846915	But pretty simple to do.
847036	848676	There's instructions all over the internet.
849016	855739	So if you want to get your homebrew on while it works, feel free to check your local...
857359	860460	We Hacking Community Forums and you should be able to find it.
860760	866902	Yeah, we reached out to Nintendo for some comment on what they were going to do about this situation and what they had to say about this whole thing.
867802	876525	That's all they had to say.
876585	877686	That's all they had to say.
879546	881247	No, because we can't drop E and rave.
882865	884847	and Hump, The Coin Return of a Pot of Pot of Machine.
885587	887649	They do have a bunch of stuff out for it right now.
887709	889450	You can get ScumVM for it.
889490	891952	They actually have a Tetris game that's someone's program.
892212	893853	There's emulators for practically everything.
893873	898717	Nintendo 64, TurboGrafx, Game Boy Color games, NES, Super NES.
899377	903701	They have a region-free player for GameCube games.
904801	906543	You can build that in there.
907083	911206	They've also got... You can upload Mii's to it.
911346	911927	You can...
913598	914099	Guardian Legend
926228	931409	Do you think this is something they'll block in a future patch?
931689	934450	Wouldn't this be very easy to close the hole in it?
934870	937051	They may be able to, but it's going to be pretty hard.
937091	940171	Or is this going to be like the PSP where it's ongoing?
940352	942032	I think it's going to be ongoing.
942692	946833	They haven't been able to block the Twilight hack thing, so that's going to be hard.
947333	950034	Even if this homebrew channel thing gets blocked, you can still use...
951095	951575	Thanks for watching!
972111	977579	Alright, well, going back over to Nintendo for a little bit, and Nintendo and Mistwalker's relationship.
977619	980723	You know, Mistwalker, of course, they have some games on the Xbox 360.
981024	983127	Kind of something interesting you may not realize.
983247	987673	Nintendo doesn't really have anything officially on the calendar right now after Wii Fit has been out.
988254	988854	Thanks for watching!
1006977	1011658	So if it's been raided by the ESRB, then there must be a localization on the way.
1012358	1016719	But that is interesting because that shows that Mistwalker is developing for more things than just Xbox.
1017019	1022920	But there is kind of that weird relationship with Microsoft-owned studios because there's the Viva Pinata game already announced for DS as well.
1023360	1027021	Well, THQ's doing a lot of those, and same with the Blue Dragon DS game, too.
1027061	1033702	Yeah, so it's not like Microsoft properties are afraid to go over to DS, which I think further cements the fact there won't be a Microsoft handheld anytime soon.
1034103	1035583	So those rumors can just go away.
1036463	1045065	Did you hear about how they were originally thinking about adding connectivity with Viva Pinata 2 and the Viva Pinata DS?
1045405	1047165	That would be very interesting, but could they do it?
1047925	1050806	Well, the way they had it done, it was only one way.
1051306	1063388	You could transfer stuff from your DS version to your Xbox 360, and the way they did it was... I don't know, there was another story coming out that they were going to have cards that you could buy or something that would allow you to...
1066209	1068470	I was going to say, this sounds like Eye of Judgment to me.
1068610	1069831	Yeah, and that's how the game would work.
1069871	1074834	It would produce a high-resolution picture on there, and then you would scan it with your camera.
1074894	1079157	Speaking of Eye of Judgment, I looked at the OLR wiki this week.
1079477	1083979	We've got awesome people maintaining the OLR wiki at orangelaunchradio.wikia.com.
1083999	1086461	You can learn a lot of stuff about the inside jokes of our show and everything.
1086861	1090923	Apparently, the Eye of Judgment has sold now 200,000 units.
1090963	1092364	We're one-fifth of the way there.
1092744	1093585	Never going to happen.
1094085	1095086	Never gonna happen.
1095186	1098727	I just love the fact that that's actually being tracked and updated on a regular basis.
1099047	1100108	Start squirming, Loki.
1100148	1100828	Start squirming.
1100908	1102029	Love it.
1102249	1103569	Five more years, it'll happen.
1104390	1104670	Alright.
1107091	1110052	Anyhow, we're gonna get back into some gaming news.
1110333	1110713	No, we're not.
1110733	1115215	We're gonna go to the mailbag because it's probably very full.
1115255	1115555	Too bad.
1115595	1116055	I refuse.
1116255	1116535	Too bad.
1117036	1118636	Then let the ferret read the emails tonight.
1118856	1119557	Let TR read them.
1119597	1119977	I don't care.
1120037	1120937	We gotta do some emails.
1121077	1122198	No, the only one I'm gonna read is hers.
1122526	1123246	Alright, Mailbag.
1123286	1125807	You're only going to read one email after two weeks being gone?
1126087	1126287	Yeah.
1126647	1127207	What do we want?
1127307	1128208	Plus a few others.
1128508	1129108	Alright, thank you.
1129228	1131929	Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to participate.
1132209	1136050	DarkSakura, open up the Mailbag, pull out a few of your favorites and read them.
1137950	1142152	This one says, Dear People, My girlfriend wants a DS and a PSP.
1142192	1143272	She has a PS3.
1143392	1145072	Please use... Oh my god!
1145152	1146293	Please use a period.
1146373	1146873	Thank you.
1149751	1150413	Okay, what was I saying?
1150453	1150714	Oh, yeah.
1151055	1153823	I was wondering... Did I mention when you email us, Jamie berates you?
1154972	1177072	I was wondering, she's only 16 and I'm wondering, you already said you were wondering if you had any ideas for a game to buy her she loves music, RPGs and FPS, what teen rated games in the genre are good so I can make her a happy gamer girl, peace out DSMaster25 and DSLoverPS, we worship Hannah Montana
1179674	1190173	Worship, W-O-E I Worship her too I would make a suggestion as for a good game For the DS, My Word Coach Yes
1192197	1213277	but you haven't really specified what system since you mentioned that she wants a DS and PSP indicating that she has neither and has a PS3 if they get a PSP there's not a lot of music games available for it actually there's no music games available for it in the United States Guitar Man, yeah that's about it I suggest getting her an Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip on it
1216364	1220925	First Person Shooters, you're going to find a few of them on PSP, not so many on the DS.
1221385	1222046	Give her a baby.
1222106	1222786	It's what she really wants.
1222826	1223826	Give her Imagine Babies.
1224747	1225647	She can have my copy.
1229208	1229888	I played it.
1230469	1231249	You saw me play it.
1231269	1234290	Tell her you're getting her ready for your long future together.
1235701	1240225	Anyway, so then I would... We're never going to get another email ever again.
1240345	1247731	If she already has a PS3, you might as well just stick with the PSP because then you can connect to it and download stuff via the PlayStation Store.
1247892	1248472	That's true.
1248512	1253536	There's also PlayStation 1 games that are available on there and also if you want to really hack the thing apart, you can...
1254677	1254858	and so on.
1271536	1274899	I also think that you should install a dictionary and a thesaurus and a grammar checker for your phone.
1296949	1303474	I think that this is cool because I honestly think that this person is Russian or from somewhere that uses the same form of alphabet.
1304374	1306536	I'm not really all that great with names.
1306936	1309097	But he sent the best screencap ever.
1309838	1318724	It's a Google search to define STFU and definitions of STFU on the web.
1318744	1320305	This is the only one that came up.
1320965	1325909	It's a weekly half hour show hosted by... It brings up the stuff on the show.
1326508	1353489	Nice, so an old reference to the show that DMN hosted on the network DJ Tyrant too Yes, and DJ Tyrant DMN, I don't think DJ Tyrant is involved with this Maybe it's a special guest or something But DMN has teamed up with Travis Donovan And they now do a show on All Games Radio If you haven't heard it yet It's Under Sedation Live 4.0 So it's the show that Jamie and I started on All grown up and retarded I was the number one guest You were
1354178	1356480	Plus I filled in for Jessica a couple times.
1356500	1357120	Yeah, now they're up to 4.0.
1357260	1358802	I filled in for you a couple of times.
1358922	1359362	Sure did.
1359522	1360563	Because I was lazy.
1360603	1361584	Where are they now?
1361784	1362605	Rob Roberts.
1363005	1365287	I got to sit in the speaker chair.
1365627	1366748	I just wanted to give a cheap plug.
1366768	1367989	Which we found the speaker chair.
1368429	1368729	Really?
1369190	1371732	At the Desiree thrift store.
1372452	1372552	Nice.
1372572	1372993	We checked.
1373833	1374033	Nice.
1374053	1374554	A few years ago.
1374614	1375074	Next email.
1375294	1375555	Okay.
1375995	1377116	This one comes from Sauce.
1378677	1379037	Okay, wait.
1379458	1380498	You have to explain for the listeners.
1380538	1381479	Listeners don't know Sauce.
1381619	1382160	What is Sauce?
1382180	1382440	Sauce.
1383706	1389871	There are a group of us who have known each other for probably going on over 10 years online.
1390671	1399738	And Kim, who is one of the group, used to always call me sis, but she's like a terrible typer, and she's like the typo queen.
1400279	1407364	So one day she typoed, and instead of, she was trying to say, sits on sis, and she put sots on sauce.
1407925	1408165	Okay.
1408645	1411946	And so ever since then, I've been Sauce, S-O-S.
1412346	1416188	And it just kind of, we made up names for everybody, like, after that.
1417388	1417788	Very nice.
1418348	1421409	And mine is, when we get together, it's Soy Sauce Reunion.
1421749	1422290	Soy Sauce.
1423070	1423330	Cute.
1423610	1424030	It works.
1424870	1426551	So, hello, Sauce, Rob, and other guys.
1426571	1428211	Girls are so weird, I swear.
1431592	1432193	Get ferreted.
1432753	1433333	Burn it.
1433393	1433693	Burn it.
1434073	1435314	Okay, this is the uber long review.
1435914	1436154	All right.
1437182	1437863	I never pronounced this right.
1437883	1438203	The Magia?
1438223	1438323	Yeah.
1466523	1471566	I hate them.
1472166	1477449	I hate Skrulls worse.
1479491	1480331	The story is good.
1480371	1484033	The graphics are more than fairly decent, as is most of the voice acting.
1484113	1490057	Tony Stark is much more brash and cocky than he is in the movie, and even I was surprised by some of the things he said.
1490757	1491618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1520413	1521113	Now I can take a breath.
1523035	1523735	You were really busy.
1525376	1529238	The drawback to this game, at least on the PSP, is the way the player controls the game.
1529278	1535161	The controls are very uncomfortable and took me quite a bit to get used to, especially the flying mechanics.
1535782	1539124	There is no option to change or rearrange the controls to make them easier to use.
1539544	1544827	Using the square X O triangle buttons to control the camera and analog stick to control pushing
1545547	1563747	forward backwards motion was very uncomfortable for me especially since pushing up on the analog stick makes you walk or hover forward but moving into flight mode makes pushing up on the analog stick actually makes you go crashing down so it reverses from standard running around mode to like jet controls
1566741	1569423	Alright, whereas pushing down on the analog stick makes you pull back up.
1569943	1577067	I suppose in a way this makes sense, but the sudden reversal of the controls makes flying a pain, especially when you wind up running around and then jumping into flight a lot.
1577607	1583910	It took me two run-throughs of the training level to get used to the controls, and even after 13 levels of play, I'm still hindered by the awkward controls.
1584691	1586972	Overall, Iron Man for the PSP is a fun game.
1587152	1589614	The controls, however, definitely detract from it overall.
1590354	1593396	If you're a die-hard Iron Man fan like I am, and she is...
1593996	1595657	This is worth having in your collection.
1595737	1599159	However, if your knowledge of Iron Man is based solely on the movie, I wouldn't bother.
1599499	1601581	My overall rating for this game is 6.5 out of 10.
1602521	1604363	Thanks and keep up the great job with the show, TRI.
1604403	1604623	P.S.
1604663	1607545	Rob is so eating cake on my birthday.
1607805	1608305	Frowning face.
1608345	1609186	We'll see, we'll see.
1609846	1611527	But that was a good review.
1611827	1614569	You should write reviews for our website whenever we get it working.
1614849	1615850	So there you go.
1615870	1617211	Yes, review wench.
1618451	1620933	Actually, Sauce has their own theme song.
1621493	1622374	And so we can play it.
1629830	1630990	I don't know.
1631030	1631431	Oh, no.
1631511	1631891	Erotic.
1631911	1632351	Oh, erotic.
1632371	1633891	I'll play erotic's version.
1634031	1634151	Yes.
1658692	1660033	But the tiger took my family.
1661093	1662353	That was, no.
1663234	1664394	I would play erotic.
1664414	1665114	But, no.
1667015	1668275	I would play erotic's version.
1668676	1674117	So that's officially, that is officially on Orange Young Radio.
1674157	1678219	Come on, they do a song called Help Me Dr. Dick.
1688419	1689240	We know this well.
1690040	1691522	But this will come into play later.
1691562	1697667	You know, someday in your nightmare, somebody's going to crop that little piece of show and play that over and over.
1699790	1704154	They have a song called Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.
1705455	1707437	And the very first song... And they were huge in DDR, by the way.
1707737	1714743	And the very first song I ever heard by them was before... Was actually when I was still playing Beatmania 98 before we even had a 2DX.
1715904	1718086	Or when DDR was still just a thought.
1719627	1720969	Was Don't Talk Dirty.
1721549	1722210	It was like the best...
1737692	1740153	I miss DDR when it had songs like this in it.
1740313	1743594	These songs are available on iTunes, by the way, and I highly suggest you buy the entire thing.
1743634	1744594	Buy the entire thing.
1744614	1746515	We cannot make this shit up.
1761519	1764321	We could, but we'd actually be telling the truth.
1765121	1765862	Next email!
1766742	1767223	Wait, hold on.
1767303	1771986	I have to read the... Look, I have the album Greatest Tits.
1772126	1774227	Here's the songs on Greatest Tits.
1774688	1780992	The Horniest Single in the World, Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex, Willie Use a Billy Boy, Help Me, Dr. Dick.
1781372	1794856	Fred, come to bed, turn me on, gotta get it grooving, give me good sex, Fritz, love my tits, sex on the phone, sexual madness, SOS, the winner takes it all, baby, please me, and in the dark of the night.
1795676	1797717	Because we all know what happens in the dark of the night.
1797977	1800978	We have booty calls all over the stuff.
1801318	1805079	We have two ABBA songs, and yeah.
1805299	1806259	So next email, okay?
1806279	1807700	I used to love sex on the phone, though.
1807720	1808520	This song was awesome.
1816322	1818143	Erotic's like the greatest band out of DDR.
1818523	1820184	But it doesn't have Don't Talk Dirty on it.
1820724	1822185	They have tons of albums.
1822245	1823526	It's not just the greatest hits.
1823646	1824566	Next email!
1826670	1837538	Dear Mailbag, like it can talk back, I'd like to think you all will have caught this piece of news, but since it was tagged onto the end of another story, I want to make sure you didn't miss it.
1837638	1840360	I know that Sky at least is a huge fan of ActRaiser.
1841440	1843522	And there's a link that says, loves you, Apollo.
1843982	1847104	This message is not brought to you by Taco Bell because it is gross.
1848485	1849626	It's on Gamasutra.
1852088	1853869	I like what I'm hearing already about ActRaiser.
1854545	1860630	Square Enix is talking about WiiWare and new ActRaiser possibilities.
1860650	1863392	Like an ActRaiser game on WiiWare?
1864373	1865154	Like an all new thing?
1865174	1867436	I will save this for the end of the show.
1868256	1869097	That's awesome.
1870038	1873621	I will make you wait in anticipation.
1874762	1875062	Thanks.
1878585	1880947	Until Rob decides to play me some more erotic.
1881829	1882690	You want some more erotic?
1882970	1883130	No.
1884371	1886293	So that means you have to wait a really fucking long time.
1888895	1894399	Do I have Don't Talk Dirty?
1894419	1895640	You should play it after the show.
1896401	1897061	If I can find it.
1897101	1897742	I don't know if I have it.
1897762	1898102	We'll see.
1898482	1900444	Next email.
1901765	1901925	What?
1916792	1918033	This is an iTunes sample.
1918093	1919794	It doesn't have the actual chorus in there.
1920314	1921434	Don't Talk Dirty was great.
1921895	1930919	Anyway, this comes... It says, is the music in the background of your FUs of the week Jumpman by Buckethead, or did you remix it?
1931319	1931539	No.
1931860	1934181	I remixed it from Jumpman by Buckethead.
1934201	1934521	Oh, you did?
1934581	1934821	Okay.
1935381	1937723	Pointless question by TJ Zeppelins in the chat.
1939964	1942925	And since I wasn't on the mic, I remixed that from Jumpman by Buckethead.
1943045	1943245	Yes.
1943525	1944806	That was where my O came from.
1946087	1946327	Hey!
1947358	1948719	Hey, you, get out of my car.
1949379	1950120	Hey, listen.
1951181	1955744	Yesterday I listened to the Bobby Blackwolf show in OLR on the PSP's official internet radio player.
1956104	1961308	The quality was really good, and there were no interruptions except for the times I disconnected and tried to reconnect.
1961408	1962489	I have a couple of questions.
1963309	1970434	One, is there any way to set the presets on the player, or is there another player that will work on the official Sony firmware?
1970774	1972976	Sometimes it was hard to find the all-game stream.
1974466	1975566	Sadly, I don't think there is.
1975626	1979407	I've played with that whole thing limitedly on the PSP.
1979587	1981187	I don't think there is a way to do it, sadly.
1981607	1983688	The PSP thing is very limited.
1984488	1984848	It sucks.
1987309	1988209	Rob, you were painting my neck.
1989369	1989569	Sorry.
1989769	1991269	It's okay.
1992510	1993430	And for your intro.
1999011	1999391	Anyhow.
1999691	2000471	I need a ferret.
2001431	2002092	Hey, listen.
2002432	2003152	Hey, listen.
2003472	2004112	Hey, listen.
2008025	2011266	2.
2008726	2011266	Is there any PSP compatible way of IRC chatting?
2011346	2013287	Listening live is great, but I want to chat too.
2015047	2017068	Alpha Canogram says it's called FreePlay.
2017108	2018468	It works for official firmware.
2018508	2019969	I'm using it now and he's in chat.
2021709	2030472	I also posted this in chat because I think the PSP and other devices could eventually be portable internet radio devices that could receive shows from all over the world.
2031392	2036254	and the next question, when is the fuck show going to happen or has Black Wolf already shut that one down?
2036614	2040375	Well, I guess Understudiation Life 4.0 does have that one every Saturday, LOL.
2040795	2041835	Thanks, PKJr92.
2041935	2043856	No matter where you go, you're there.
2044076	2046097	We've said fuck an awful lot this episode, though, haven't we?
2046177	2049358	If we told you when it was, that would break the rules of the fuck show.
2049418	2050878	Yes, the fuck show is a surprise.
2050918	2052199	I will tell you when it is not.
2052619	2055540	The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.
2056448	2061171	And the sixth anniversary show is going to be... Whatever the fuck we want it.
2061351	2062852	June... On the sixth anniversary.
2062972	2065634	It can either be the... Probably the 22nd is the closest.
2065674	2067335	June 22nd will be our sixth birthday.
2068096	2069317	So I don't know what we're doing for that yet.
2069337	2070237	Yeah.
2070858	2071638	Sixth birthday.
2071658	2071718	Wow.
2072259	2073279	Yeah, I know, for real.
2073760	2075461	Our show is old enough to be in first grade.
2077102	2077442	Wow.
2077582	2079744	Six years ago, Orange Lounge Radio started.
2080104	2080765	I know, it's crazy.
2081305	2081705	Fuck.
2082706	2085348	That's what I said.
2085368	2085448	Fuck.
2087017	2087397	Alright.
2087958	2091140	So, um, next email.
2091300	2092640	Oh my god, I've got three left, okay.
2093801	2096603	I'm trying to be nice because we weren't here last weekend.
2097463	2101306	Um, is there, okay, oh, we have one called Hello.
2102246	2102847	Hello.
2103387	2104388	Is there anyone there?
2104548	2105828	Have you fallen off the world?
2106049	2106729	I miss you.
2106849	2108090	Sad face Rick from UK.
2108638	2111940	I think that was when our stream went forever with no new updates.
2112401	2116824	Part B went out on Friday or Saturday, so hopefully... Rob had the plague.
2117004	2117764	Yes, I had SARS.
2118365	2119265	No, no, no, no, no.
2119586	2120887	They put him on the cart even.
2120987	2124049	He was about to get carried off to the incendiary.
2124149	2125750	But then he said he was going to go up for a walk.
2127552	2127912	NextEmail.com
2157222	2157922	My cat got it back.
2157942	2160343	I was going to say my cat pooped the rubber band today.
2160723	2162824	I'm so fucking proud.
2162844	2166445	I am so fucking proud of you.
2167945	2168686	I'm not really.
2168726	2170466	Is that what this show is resorted to?
2171886	2173227	But cats are like our children.
2173307	2176768	Coming up in Wii News, oh, my cat pooped out a rubber band today.
2179589	2182390	I'm very concerned because that means she ate a rubber band.
2182490	2183110	It could have killed her.
2186115	2187256	My cat eats grass.
2187476	2188896	Seriously, fuck this show.
2191337	2192438	Can I re-fix email?
2193338	2194479	Sure, I don't care anymore.
2194819	2196820	So I says I can't, so this segment's over.
2197680	2197920	Okay.
2198520	2201041	Hello, everyone in the world!
2202482	2205924	We may as well be fucking doing a drunk show because we're all lunatics.
2206344	2209105	Seriously, I would be drinking right now if it wouldn't kill me.
2210782	2214044	For those of you who do not know me, I don't know you, so okay.
2214565	2214965	No, I'm kidding.
2215425	2217226	My name is Chris Phillips, a.k.a.
2217346	2218107	ChrisPhil1724.
2218427	2221749	Must be a really old school name.
2222190	2225052	A tournament slash event organizer for all games and allgames.com.
2225272	2227333	Oh, yeah, he used to do video stuff for all games.
2227633	2228094	I know he is.
2228914	2230275	He's a good man, Charlie Brown.
2232917	2234077	Don't cough up a rubber band.
2236314	2236554	on July 24th, 2005.
2264738	2269782	Bobby Blackwolf aired his first live show on All Games Radio, known as The Bobby Blackwolf Show.
2270323	2274266	This show was, in fact, the first ever weekly podcast on All Games Radio.
2274866	2279590	Ever since that date, The Bobby Blackwolf Show has aired a new show every Sunday night at 8 p.m.
2279810	2280771	EST, 5 p.m.
2280791	2284694	PST, a streak that has lasted nearly 35 months.
2285555	2292581	This weekend was marked as the first week in 147 weeks without a new episode of The Bobby Blackwolf Show ending his remarkable run.
2294281	2299065	Now, Bobby would never broadcast this noteworthy accomplishment, and you may not even like the fact that I'm doing this.
2299646	2303449	As fellow podcasters, you all know how hard it is to do a show week in and week out.
2303709	2307873	To that end, I feel this achievement is worth mentioning, and congratulations are in order.
2308333	2311796	If you'd like to write a small email to Bobby or... Oh my god, I'm sorry.
2312177	2313257	We're doing it live, Bobby!
2313518	2313858	Yay!
2317261	2318282	Well done, DarkSakura.
2320484	2321845	Let's hear it for Bobby Blackwell.
2329189	2330911	I was looking for the moaning noises, but alright.
2332752	2334074	No, that is a good accomplishment.
2335215	2335775	It really is.
2335855	2338978	I mean, God, we're lucky if we go ten weeks.
2340700	2340940	Alright.
2341681	2346426	Dear OLR and Loki 2, you know how that's gonna go.
2347267	2350269	You're going to know in the first four words how that's going to go.
2351230	2352512	I have a Macintosh.
2354423	2373142	and I don't use it to play games I can understand why Loki would not like a Macintosh computer because he uses his computer to play video games now can we shut up about this whole Loki hates Macintoshes thing they just don't deserve they just don't serve his needs to be honest we've sort of dropped this a long ass fucking time ago it's the listeners that keep bringing it up am I right?
2373755	2381761	Well, once in a while there'll be a story and he'll make a snide comment that reminds us, but I don't think there's been a good old-fashioned brawl over it in a while.
2381781	2384383	The only people bringing it up is the fucking Mac users.
2385165	2388548	My wife does this every time a stupid Mac commercial comes on TV.
2388568	2390509	She's like, see, they said it's true.
2390869	2391970	I'm like, shut up.
2392130	2392931	It's on TV.
2393031	2393872	It must be true.
2393912	2396294	I'll never forget when the Mac fan came to Fonamay.
2396314	2398195	Oh, shit.
2398215	2399316	I remember that last year.
2399376	2401358	Which, by the way, notice we're not at Fonamay this year.
2402959	2403559	I don't care.
2404500	2406241	It was a conspiracy by Mac users.
2406321	2407823	No, we'll be back at Fonamay next year.
2407863	2408703	I promise.
2408743	2409384	We have to.
2410618	2412640	If we're still around, my god, we're getting old.
2413300	2413661	You are.
2413681	2415282	If we don't die of old age first.
2416583	2417644	You're gonna die of the plague.
2418345	2418685	Thanks.
2419126	2420166	I'm gonna die of awesome.
2420206	2421127	Dr. Mario will cure it.
2421247	2422188	I'm gonna die of awesome.
2422328	2423930	Alright, are you gonna read any more of this email?
2424190	2424530	Should I?
2426132	2426952	Pick a paragraph.
2427012	2427673	Read a paragraph.
2427693	2428574	I'll read more.
2428634	2429695	That's not why I wrote.
2429855	2432317	I wrote because I have a few things I want to say about Nintendo.
2432437	2433118	Okay, whatever.
2435380	2435460	Um...
2437139	2439841	is basically saying that Nintendo sells a lot of stuff.
2440982	2441322	The end.
2446145	2448347	Maybe you should post that on the super long email of the week thread.
2448467	2451189	I'm actually going to do that because right now my throat hurts.
2451309	2454591	And it actually is from Hippolytus, a.k.a.
2454631	2455672	Black Boy, who we remember.
2456092	2456713	Yes.
2457073	2466220	You are actually going to be the person who brings back the long-ass fucking email thread of the week.
2467353	2468654	on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2469054	2469974	Congratulations.
2470114	2471755	Does this call for fanfare?
2472235	2472475	Yes.
2477557	2480198	It's a good email, but my throat hurts a lot.
2481039	2484440	I will post it on the forums and link it in the chat room.
2486361	2488021	Long email is very long.
2489362	2492803	If you want to send us long emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2493464	2494904	Meantime, more gaming news.
2494964	2495404	Yes, Loki?
2495785	2495985	Yes.
2498030	2499751	I was just reading something else that's kind of interesting.
2499871	2501993	But this is sort of interesting.
2502433	2504435	It'd be more interesting if it weren't the N-Gage.
2504615	2505355	But, uh, yes.
2507417	2512761	Metal Gear Solid Mobile has somehow found its way on the N-Gage.
2513361	2513962	That's right.
2514382	2516744	You will be able to play Metal Gear Solid.
2517784	2522027	The winner of two 2007 International Mobile Gaming Awards.
2523168	2523709	And, uh...
2524469	2530471	Apparently it's coming to the N-Gage shortly after the launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 for the PS3.
2531671	2535092	So, um... That's cool, I guess.
2535112	2538933	At least they're getting some actual big-name games.
2540833	2541733	N-Gage is still around.
2543094	2543634	Yeah.
2545534	2548135	Well, do you remember Nolan Bushnell?
2548195	2550276	I hope you do, because he was one of the...
2551775	2553777	Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese, right?
2553957	2555338	That was Pizza Time Theater.
2556279	2556699	Well, whatever.
2556719	2558241	I like the name better.
2558341	2558761	And Pong, right?
2558781	2558841	Yes.
2559562	2567149	Well, he apparently was speaking at the Wedbush Morgan Securities Annual Management Access Conference.
2567609	2570912	And he's saying the game piracy, it's on its way out.
2570972	2578419	He says, quote, there is a stealth encryption chip called a TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now.
2579019	2579640	It's not gonna work.
2595777	2596318	Why is that?
2596658	2597940	Because everything can be cracked.
2598180	2601384	And the fact that you said that it can't be cracked is just going to make people want to crack it.
2601404	2603807	It is an invitation to the crackers to say, please crack this.
2603827	2608012	Trust me, if it can be modified, it will be modified on the board.
2608252	2610695	Or they'll find a way to emulate it and they'll just disable it.
2611216	2612778	There are ways to do everything.
2613058	2614220	It has been done before.
2614360	2615361	Or they'll just stop buying games altogether.
2640393	2640873	Thanks for watching!
2659366	2667668	There are games out there now that have it, you know, where you have to play it, you know, and it talks to a server online to validate that it's an official copy of the game.
2667808	2668769	Those have been cracked.
2669269	2674810	You know, there's stuff on the PSP that they've had countless firmware upgrades that are supposed to prevent piracy and stuff.
2675151	2676251	Those have all been cracked.
2676691	2683013	I mean, what... Ranma in chat, chat.orange.com says, Intel tried that with their Pentium 3 chips and boards.
2683093	2683493	It didn't work.
2684013	2690997	Yeah, I mean, it's a nice attempt, and, you know, people should be a little bit more legit with stuff, but it's just not gonna happen.
2692398	2695920	It really isn't, so... I don't know.
2696040	2700603	Just because you stop people from pirating a game does not mean that they are gonna go buy your game.
2701083	2702264	That's the other problem, too.
2702384	2708347	Because they're assuming that people that are pirating these things had intended to buy it in the first place.
2709208	2710048	That's not always the case.
2710068	2710488	That's a good point.
2710548	2713070	I think a lot of pirates probably wouldn't even bother buying the games.
2714420	2715142	I really think that.
2716063	2721754	But it sounds like maybe he's trying to combat piracy in other countries, not necessarily just the US, but where it's way more rampant.
2722656	2723418	You think that might be the case?
2724423	2724883	Good luck.
2725483	2732706	But if anything, the Chinese and stuff, they've gotten piracy down big time.
2732766	2736587	So I don't see this affecting much.
2737167	2737528	All right.
2737568	2741209	Well, I don't know about you guys, but I get the feeling we've heard this all before.
2741329	2745070	And when I hear things and I don't see results, I get irritated.
2745130	2747451	And when I get irritated, we do the FUs of the week.
2763394	2764435	F you to the dollar store.
2765757	2768700	We went to get a USB cable, and there were none out on the shelf.
2768780	2770782	Like, the whole supply of them wasn't there.
2771363	2778671	So I asked if someone would go and look in the back and see if there were any, because just about any other store I go to, people are willing to look in the back and just, oh, we don't have any.
2779592	2780013	So that was it.
2781727	2787211	F you to the virtual friends in Grand Theft Auto 4.
2787732	2789853	I don't want to go do activities with you.
2789913	2792555	That's why I'm not calling you back, you idiots.
2793556	2794677	But at least they have sleep mode.
2794697	2796038	But it's still annoying.
2796218	2799640	Yes, it's still annoying though when you have people going, I haven't heard from you forever.
2799660	2800761	I want to go drinking.
2801261	2802062	It's like, fuck that.
2802082	2803083	I have to shoot pigeons.
2805264	2806165	So they don't understand.
2806995	2817102	My FU of the week goes to the antibiotic C-Pro, which I was taking because the doctor thought I had an infection, even though I'm pretty sure I had a virus based on the high fever I had and the fact that the antibiotics didn't really work.
2817577	2845432	but I was taking it for so long that finally like my chest started to like tighten up and I got a big old red rash on my chest so I stopped taking it because that's not a good reaction to have especially when you just had pancreatitis so I chose to stop taking it so F you to C-Pro DrewNami F you to friends, so-called friends who make their mission in life to bring your ass down I'm not naming names no one anyone here would know
2847680	2857683	FU to Rock Band and all its goodness for making my throat hurt like hell and FU to Mellow Gear Solid 2.
2858643	2861044	Stop busting me.
2861204	2863565	Just because I suck.
2864185	2865485	Anything you want to say FU to?
2866065	2867946	I'm good, thanks.
2868626	2869746	FU to you for being so happy.
2869766	2871627	Yeah, really, we're jealous.
2872407	2873167	I know, what's your secret?
2873887	2876188	Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
2877301	2878942	Let's get back into some gaming news.
2880043	2881223	DarkSakura is going to take it.
2881403	2882184	Well, she's coughing.
2882224	2884185	I just wanted to ask, are you sure you didn't have anthrax?
2884345	2886806	Because Cipro is what they give you if you have anthrax.
2886966	2887827	For real, huh?
2887887	2889068	No, I did not have anthrax.
2889108	2889628	Thank gosh.
2890128	2891849	I do have an anthrax CD somewhere.
2891869	2894391	Did you start developing the rash as soon as you started taking it?
2894411	2895431	No, it was about five days into it.
2895451	2896352	Five days into it?
2896472	2896672	Yeah.
2896972	2918003	of course she didn't have anthrax it does suck I've been to the doctor so much in the past two months I couldn't go back over the rash I was just like you know what I feel fine I'm just not going to take it I have some drug stuff to talk to you about after the show too because I know drug stuff yay drugs drugs are rad there's a new Pokemon game coming out yay
2919946	2921347	Pokemon, colors we haven't thought of yet.
2946710	2951494	I still like my Pokemans, but I have a feeling this will be just Emerald all over again.
2951515	2952315	Pokemon's a good game.
2952335	2959422	I don't know, Platinum sounds like... I don't know.
2959862	2962645	I can't help but think of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
2963806	2969431	I played Pokemon Pearl for a while, but I only played it at the gym while I was riding the recumbent bike.
2971528	2983676	So, apparently the casting has, or some rumors about casting have come out about the Prince of Persia movie, and Jake Gyllenhaal is now reported to be the Prince of Persia.
2983696	2986257	Wow, that's... Because he looks so Persian.
2986838	2987318	I know.
2988118	2988699	Totally.
2988719	2992081	Dude, Bubble Boy is the Prince of Persia.
2992141	2992881	That's pretty awesome.
2994602	2996764	Bubble Boy was on TV the other day.
2996884	2998645	I've watched that way too many times.
3000259	3002341	But yeah, I don't know.
3003903	3005384	I can't be too excited about this.
3006966	3008447	He just looks too lethargic.
3008587	3009028	I'm sorry.
3009068	3013712	He's just very like... I have to act?
3018476	3020938	As long as it's hot like Brokeback Mountain, then we're fine.
3021638	3023520	I can't quit you, Prince of Persia.
3024380	3025081	Excuse me?
3025101	3026041	A baking powder?
3026322	3032746	Speaking of video game movies, $200 million!
3032766	3034568	$200 million, Variety reports.
3034948	3040171	Crystal Sky Pictures has signed this deal for $200 million financing.
3040812	3045816	And what this millions of dollars is going to be used, it's going to fund Castlevania
3046934	3052716	A sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled and Pac-Man, the movie.
3052916	3056817	So they're making Stranglehold the game, the movie, and then the game?
3056837	3058098	Because it'll come back around again.
3058138	3059898	What a horrible night to have a movie.
3060399	3064960	Now look, we know that Castlevania has been, like, this has been off and on with Rider Strike and everything.
3064980	3070282	We know this was on the table, but seriously, Pac-Man, the movie, like...
3071089	3072430	How in the hell is that going to work?
3072490	3074731	I mean, Pac-Man did have a TV show.
3074871	3075431	He's a drug addict.
3075471	3076231	It was a cartoon.
3076251	3077732	I guess if Pac-Man's a cartoon, it might work.
3077752	3078493	It's a dumb idea.
3078653	3079673	He's a pill popper.
3080293	3084595	It's a dumb idea, although we did throw around the premise of a Pac-Man movie.
3086696	3096861	One man in the future will save the world from Inky, Binky, and Clyde using dots.
3096961	3098222	Why are you talking like Triple H?
3099646	3100387	It's the movie man.
3100427	3108854	No, what you would do is you would have a cop on the edge, you know, played by Joe Pesci.
3109254	3109895	No, not Joe Pesci.
3109935	3113198	That would be funny, though.
3114659	3115700	He knew too much.
3116020	3118962	Now the ghosts of his past are after him.
3119403	3120243	Gerardimo wins.
3120283	3123906	He says the Pac-Man movie will have Kylie Minowas miss Pac-Man and it'll be awesome.
3124527	3125047	That's a good point.
3125388	3125608	Lame.
3129946	3130527	Do not want.
3130787	3131507	Do not want.
3139034	3142277	DarkSakura, what could they possibly do a Pac-Man movie about?
3142297	3143498	Have you ever seen the cartoon from the 80s?
3143538	3146941	Dude, the cartoon from the 80s was great, and there was Pac-Land.
3147121	3150464	Unless there is only one feasible way I could see this happening.
3150925	3150965	3D.
3151465	3154288	And it would not be a movie that they would be able to promote very well.
3154768	3159189	is if they did a Pac-Man porno where they dressed everybody up in ridiculous costumes and made them have sex.
3159449	3160990	That's the only way this could work.
3161350	3165771	It's scary, but it's the only feasible way this could possibly work.
3165951	3167311	Not sure if want.
3167611	3171952	We reached out to Atari for comment on the Pac-Man movie and this is all they had to say.
3176813	3179134	Too bad it's Namco that's gonna be taking care of that.
3180495	3182777	My theory... It's a joke from like three weeks ago.
3182797	3183958	I know, it is.
3183978	3184878	That was for the fans.
3185539	3187520	Wow, I missed the bus.
3187560	3188981	Yeah, I missed the bus, sorry.
3192844	3193144	What?
3193624	3195065	I feel it's going to be CG.
3195866	3196366	Probably.
3196806	3198347	I feel it's going to be poop.
3200829	3202490	It's going to be a pooped out rubber band.
3204532	3205172	You know what?
3206013	3207814	You need to take that toilet paper joke book...
3212472	3215715	Turn it upside down and turn that front.
3215775	3224641	SSJ100Matt says that Jessica Alba should be Mrs. Pac-Man, but that makes me think that all games Jessica, if she doesn't get the role in that horror movie, she should make Ms.
3224681	3225681	Pac-Man her next goal.
3226482	3227923	Come on, I'm only recycling your material.
3227963	3231305	Come on, if she doesn't win that, don't you think she's suffered enough?
3233327	3233867	I don't know.
3236349	3236689	All right.
3238806	3239767	More news, please.
3239807	3240447	Can I have news?
3240927	3241467	No, you can't.
3242128	3244089	You can have... Okay.
3245229	3251393	Well, for people who give a shit, and I'm not one of them, Postal's coming to Blu-ray in August.
3253033	3256435	Postal is that movie made by... What's his name?
3257216	3258716	Who did a bunch of shitty movies?
3259457	3260097	Uwe Boll!
3260497	3261638	Yeah, he sucks.
3262198	3263979	Sadly enough, I have this pre-ordered already.
3264259	3264760	You do? !
3266118	3268180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3292458	3293619	I'm sorry, what?
3295420	3298062	It grossed less than $5 million.
3298082	3300864	Well, it's only in four theaters.
3301124	3304287	It grossed less than $5.
3305648	3307609	How did it even make $5 million?
3308130	3309471	It shows not $5,000.
3309771	3313814	Well, first off, it just came out, I mean, literally this week.
3314154	3315195	We wish it would go back.
3316604	3317605	I don't know, I'd see it.
3317765	3321347	But, see, because this looks actually semi-interesting to me.
3321447	3324929	I've watched an UiBowl movie before, the Blood Rain 2 movie.
3326530	3329312	Interesting premise, execution was shit.
3329652	3331353	Loki, you're part of the problem.
3331693	3334495	Hey, I had to watch it in order to talk to UiBowl, okay?
3334715	3335656	We interviewed him.
3336216	3336857	That was fun.
3337237	3339178	You're part of the reason he keeps making this shit.
3339678	3342260	Hey, I didn't actually pay you to see this movie.
3343885	3344425	It was a screener.
3345206	3346226	But yeah, I get to talk to him.
3346426	3346847	It's cool.
3347807	3349048	He's making a game, too, by the way.
3350489	3351349	It's Tunnel Rat.
3353090	3354091	Hooray.
3355191	3361395	No, it's about these guys that are in Vietnam, and they go into the... Oh, dude, Tunnel Rat was the name of the G.I.
3361435	3361635	Joe.
3363036	3366317	Yeah, probably named for the same reason, but... Yeah.
3366337	3367218	I don't know.
3368390	3369931	Talk about another movie that's going to suck.
3370231	3373853	I was trying to see how much Postal made over the weekend, but it's not even on the top ten.
3373873	3374313	Surprise.
3376454	3377955	I'm trying to think where you would go to see that.
3377975	3379355	I looked at Box Office Mojo.
3379395	3380416	I couldn't find it.
3380496	3382357	But I'm looking now for the Rotten Tomatoes score.
3382377	3384958	11% on Rotten Tomatoes for Postal.
3384998	3386219	IMDB sometimes has the...
3393845	3398406	I'm looking at positive reviews for Postal.
3398466	3398826	Let's see.
3400127	3409669	Prairie Miller from Newsblaze says, Along the way to its parking lot showdown, a wacky property damage conspiracy to commit insurance fraud is uncovered between Osama and Bush.
3410049	3413470	The darker, zany recesses of America is viewed from the Twilight Zone.
3413530	3414470	Move over, Barat.
3416198	3416439	What?
3416919	3417299	Let's see.
3417359	3419561	Here's another positive review from Cam Williams.
3420061	3425545	I suppose since almost seven years have passed since 9-11, America might finally be ready to laugh at the tragedy.
3425965	3429187	Tasteless, profane, and far-fetched, but undeniably funny, too.
3429827	3430648	Hmm.
3431008	3431869	Dot, dot, dot.
3431889	3432669	That's all I have to say.
3433530	3434891	Film threat, Jeremy Knox.
3435411	3442276	It's not perfect, and will get on the nerves of the more opinionated critics out there, but it's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.
3443993	3448621	Those are the three positive reviews, giving it 11% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
3449002	3450705	I do have to admit, the poster is pretty funny.
3451426	3455213	I mean, it's offensive, it's highly offensive, but it's mildly amusing.
3456832	3458814	LucasArts, Activision, and NVIDIA
3483476	3487537	or Activision Blizzard, which I still don't understand why they're still referring to them as two different companies.
3488438	3488978	But whatever.
3490358	3496561	And it's unclear what their decision, why they decided to drop out of the ESA, but we do know that they're gone.
3497761	3501582	So apparently... One more out the door.
3502022	3502463	Interesting.
3504643	3506224	Any theories why this is happening, Loki?
3507318	3507678	I don't know.
3508018	3510780	Maybe they just don't feel like ESA is representing them enough.
3510980	3516283	Or maybe they're just getting cheap and they don't want to pay the money to the ESA to help defend them.
3516323	3518365	And besides, I mean, think about it this way.
3518425	3521887	It's like they're defending the game industry, okay?
3521927	3525529	And anybody that's joined up with the ESA has to pay them to defend the game industry.
3525829	3529211	Well, if you drop out of the ESA, they're still defending you.
3529331	3531072	So it's like you're getting a free ride.
3531732	3535835	Robin Chat says the ESA business seems to be the beginning of a new consortium.
3536519	3537900	I don't know, it sounded pretty gay to me.
3540042	3541003	Why did you say that?
3542384	3545166	I mean, they're just freeloading on this shit.
3546267	3559137	Well, that's just my opinion on why they're, I mean, it makes perfect business sense if, you know, okay, well I can eliminate this cost and they're still doing the work for me, so, as unethical as it is, eh, whatever.
3560305	3565809	Well, speaking of things that are pretty gay, Xbox Live has been going on a banning marathon lately.
3566269	3569091	A couple of bannings recently have caught some attention.
3569831	3573494	The Gayer Gamer was a gamer tag that got banned recently.
3574675	3576696	Also, this gamer tag got banned.
3576816	3580379	Richard Gaywood was a gamer tag that got banned.
3580399	3582300	And you might be thinking, ha ha ha, Gaywood.
3582560	3583761	There's actually a street near here.
3583981	3584761	It's Gaywood Street.
3585002	3585662	Dick Gaywood.
3585722	3586402	Here's the thing.
3586743	3589504	His name is really Richard Gaywood.
3589804	3591646	His parents apparently hate him.
3592246	3593226	No, that's the last name.
3593246	3594327	You don't get to pick your last name.
3594667	3597229	There's actually a scan of his driver's license up on the internet.
3597269	3598410	His name was Richard Gaywood.
3599370	3602772	Now, why you would want to use your name as your gamer tag is beyond me.
3602872	3604813	But granted, did Xbox...
3605854	3606494	Overreact.
3607254	3610635	Some gay-themed websites chimed in on this.
3611295	3618296	LesbianGamer said, I've taken a few deep breaths, run this story over in my mind again and again, and yet still return to the same annoying factor.
3618656	3625077	Why does gay automatically equate to sex or of asexual nature and carry with it such negative and deviant overtones?
3625457	3633839	I can understand Microsoft is trying to protect users, but perhaps there needs to be some tabled debate as to what they're protecting whom from and what they're perpetuating in the process.
3634259	3638160	linking gay to some negative or sexually explicit content merely fans of fires of homophobia.
3638900	3652504	Gay Gamer said this, I'm somewhat on the fence with the issue having played many MMORPGs and seeing the many annoying and disturbing names that can come from the idle minds on the internets and it seems as if Microsoft is putting up the normal we can't make exceptions defense.
3652904	3659766	All of this however is greatly outweighed by the fact that it is given name and despite the connotations it may carry with it he lives with that name every day.
3660817	3669811	and I'm sure you've probably been wondering what I, the gay host of Orange Lawn Radio have to say on this subject and honestly, you want my honest opinion on this subject?
3670552	3673957	We have much bigger things to worry about in life than this.
3675188	3694574	for instance they are going to try and overturn the recent gay marriage thing that was passed in the state of California by the Supreme Court finally have allowed gay marriage to happen in the state in less than 30 days and the crazies are going to try and put it on the November ballot and according to recent polls 54% of Californians would vote for it
3695509	3696730	to overturn gay marriage.
3697050	3706417	Because, yeah, suddenly you're going to let gays marry and there's going to be like this just sudden fuckwave going through the state and everybody's going to start fucking everywhere because that's what happens when you let gays get married.
3706477	3709640	Next thing you know, cats will marry dogs and up is down.
3709700	3711901	Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
3713743	3714383	Stupid.
3714964	3716385	So, you know what I have to say?
3716465	3718046	The hell with Xbox Live.
3718086	3718927	It's their service.
3718947	3720428	They can do whatever they want.
3720468	3723290	I mean, yeah, it's a little asinine, but whatever.
3724670	3725170	Rob, I have a question.
3725190	3727090	We have more important things to worry about right now.
3727911	3728131	Yes.
3728951	3733552	If gay marriage is allowed, wouldn't that, like, lower the amount of gay sex that's happening?
3734532	3736892	You know, because once you get married, you stop having sex.
3737112	3737912	Yeah, it really would.
3738072	3738372	She has a point.
3738392	3742853	So, you know, that would be good for the, you know, the right wing if, you know, gay marriage was allowed.
3744074	3745574	Welcome to the Olive Garden Roundtable.
3745594	3752135	That, and there would be a lot more economic growth for all of the gay men registering.
3753246	3754467	I loved what Ellen said.
3754507	3760852	I'm sorry to get political on this show but for obvious reasons this is something I feel very, very strongly and it won't be the last time I say something about it.
3760992	3763034	It's a deal.
3763114	3764375	Do you see any of us protesting?
3764415	3764935	No, I know, I know.
3765236	3775664	But I love what Ellen said to John McCain is that she said something about she compared it to and it's really like this is that you say there's two chairs over there and you can sit in one but you can't sit in the other.
3776245	3776625	Why not?
3776685	3777225	You just can't.
3779027	3779787	That's what it feels like.
3780248	3780668	Think about it.
3781429	3781669	All right.
3783086	3783526	That's it.
3783926	3786147	I am against chair marriage as well.
3787427	3788487	That's just wrong.
3790048	3791008	What would we do without you?
3791028	3798470	I honestly, I think that the best, one of the best, and I'm sure a lot of people know by now I'm a big fan of the show Bullshit.
3799630	3802351	Watch the episode about gay marriage and polyamory.
3803131	3803591	Seriously.
3804537	3806078	Thank God for the youth of America.
3806238	3809179	Because I seriously think I'm probably preaching to the choir most people of this show.
3809219	3815441	I mean, I know we have tons and tons of heterosexual people that listen to this show that probably listen to this and go, what's the big freaking deal?
3816202	3817362	That's what we're saying.
3817682	3818602	That's all we're saying.
3818662	3820323	What's the big freaking deal?
3820563	3823144	Because people have the religious corncob up their ass.
3823844	3825865	That's a lot less comfortable than other things to be up their ass.
3825885	3826405	I'll tell you what.
3826445	3829527	There's a million other things we're going to hell for before gay marriage.
3829567	3830207	I'll tell you that.
3831386	3833128	Anyhow, moving on.
3833688	3835370	Please get me off my political tangent.
3836050	3838212	I'll kick the soapbox out from under you.
3839753	3846940	Well, how about we speak of our common nemesis that we have with the rest of the video game community.
3847140	3848981	Everyone can agree, no matter what.
3849462	3850423	Everyone can agree.
3850623	3851944	He who shall not be named.
3852104	3853005	That this guy's a moron.
3854682	3858166	I'm gonna say his name so that I can read this headline, which is wonderful.
3858906	3864952	Jack Thompson, guilty man, 27 of 31 misconduct charges recommended by judge.
3866114	3868876	There's a lovely picture under this on the Destructoid article.
3868896	3869857	You said his name.
3869997	3872220	This is karma, you dump it, you drink it.
3872400	3872540	Lovely.
3875263	3875523	Lovely.
3875822	3886649	Yeah, um, so basically, um, dude is on, uh, dude's guilty for fucking up.
3886869	3889171	Did Jack Thompson jump up and go, objection!
3889851	3890812	No, because he's not that cute.
3890892	3891853	Overruled, bitch.
3893194	3897897	I, the day that he is completely, um, what's the word, disbarred?
3899278	3901139	I am going to...
3903723	3904563	What's something awesome?
3905463	3909184	Dude, when Jack Thompson is disbarred, I might dress up as Tingle.
3910144	3910665	Do it!
3910825	3911365	Uh-huh!
3911965	3913205	Uh-huh!
3913545	3913885	Shit.
3914325	3915606	No, he just said he might.
3915666	3923888	No, they're having the results of the disbarring trial on June 4th, so it is, you know, like... I didn't say I would, I said I might.
3923948	3924848	Yes, you did, you said you would.
3924868	3925528	I said I might.
3925968	3926708	No takes and bansies.
3926728	3927468	What did his June 4th fall on?
3931089	3933491	We will be live on Wednesday, June 4th.
3933511	3933991	No, I'm kidding.
3934171	3934712	If they let us.
3936253	3937414	We will record live.
3937454	3938735	Where would I get a Tingle outfit?
3939755	3940836	Where would I even get that?
3941957	3944099	Ranma would send one to you.
3944239	3945360	Okay, you know what?
3945900	3946060	What?
3946080	3947261	You'll bring back Dr. Dick.
3948202	3948642	We'll see.
3949563	3950243	Or Mr. Spanky.
3950263	3955067	There will be celebration of some sort happening when Lord Voldemort is disbarred.
3957155	3962619	I think that's... And on top of that, we need to send a letter to Ice Cube.
3963019	3963840	Wiki this, please.
3964240	3964540	Why?
3965101	3967282	No, it wasn't Ice Cube, it was Ice T. Why?
3967622	3972826	Because Fuckhead got him back in the 90s for his album, remember?
3972846	3973226	Oh, yes.
3973246	3974587	Because his big thing was music.
3975248	3976709	And then he moved from music to video games.
3977329	3980651	All this guy wants is to have the world lick his ass.
3981072	3981972	Not kiss it, lick it.
3982733	3983914	Licking is far more disgusting.
3985595	3985915	All right.
3987168	3989629	We're going to be opening up the Skype line very soon.
3989749	3991109	Let's pay Paula Terry to do that.
3992170	3996451	Well, it sounds just like her singing.
3996471	4002974	1-877-GAME-OLR But first, one more story that's not about Lord Voldemort or tingle dressing.
4003494	4005514	Yes, and this is not a bad story, actually.
4006755	4011457	There's going to be some Japanese songs that may be hitting rock band very soon, actually.
4013604	4026668	Apparently, a Harmonix developer told Joystick during Rock Band's party in New York City that they will be seeing some Japanese rock music in the games.
4027389	4033031	Apparently, there should be an announcement coming soon, but who knows?
4033091	4036672	Maybe some stuff like TM Revolution, Malice Miser...
4037967	4038207	Outro Music
4053703	4054964	But Basewolf is dead.
4054984	4057126	Did they replace... Gacked, maybe.
4057667	4058748	Bees, definitely.
4059068	4059509	There you go.
4059529	4061350	They probably have Smop or something.
4061410	4064033	Listen, this is what Activision needs to do, okay?
4064093	4071660	If you want to make an actual game that's going to be something that stands out from all these other music games out there, you make the official Guitar Wolf game.
4071880	4074623	You have it be an action game with music playing in it as well.
4074643	4074803	Zombies.
4075043	4078349	with zombies and you fight zombies with your awesome guitar skills.
4078889	4080031	Ooh, this is a good game here.
4080552	4083657	So you would fight zombies with your guitar and you're a Japanese rock star.
4083777	4085280	It'd probably, though, have, like...
4086513	4086893	Bumper Chicken
4110413	4111334	I was wondering where that was.
4111614	4112234	It's in my house.
4112635	4113215	Oh, okay.
4113696	4117018	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.
4117038	4117939	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4118019	4119980	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4120341	4124864	We only have time for a couple calls tonight, so we're going to try to keep this short and keep the calls short, too.
4124924	4125825	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4125845	4126165	Who's this?
4127066	4127546	Hey, hey, hey.

4131069	4132670	Why level 30 Ranma S?
4134031	4137834	I just served my big level 30 this past weekend, and I am sober.
4138732	4139172	Congrats.
4139192	4139633	Whoa.
4140494	4143416	Oh, you are having the same birthday that I'm having next month.

4149041	4149361	Thank you.
4150322	4152124	What else is on your mind besides that you're old?
4153685	4155426	I finally got my Xbox 360.
4156447	4157128	Ooh, what'd you think?
4159150	4161452	I kind of wish I'd gotten it soon, but I'm pretty happy with it.
4161512	4165415	And I have to thank Loki because he's been randy about Saints Row and Crackdown.
4165435	4166276	I actually picked him up.
4167271	4196640	they're like dirt cheap now so yeah and I'm enjoying it Crackdown is really Crackdown is a great game what made you finally what finally broke you into getting an Xbox 360 what was it that finally made you go yes I need this because between because we already have a Wii in the house and what's left is the PS3 and Xbox 360 and there's one thing that the Xbox 360 has that the PS3 does not which is games that I'd actually play there you have it
4199437	4200458	Rumble Roses XX Bioshock 32 inch
4220814	4221154	Oh yeah.
4221655	4222195	Very sexy.
4222395	4224057	So we'll have to jam on Rock Band sometime.
4224337	4225197	Add me to your friends list.
4225217	4226158	I think I have room.
4226498	4226919	I may not.
4226979	4227239	I don't know.
4227259	4232002	I hope so because I will go check it and I did download Yaris while y'all was on break.
4232623	4232943	Wow.
4232983	4233484	What'd you think?
4234284	4235805	I haven't played it yet but this is the way I look at it.
4236226	4237186	Free game is free.
4237567	4240389	Free game is free but free game is also a bit of a waste of time.
4240429	4241189	What are you laughing at?
4241229	4241570	I'm sorry.
4242430	4245152	DarkSakura's being very distracting tonight because she's laughing at something.
4245492	4249235	She's showing us this YouTube video of a flying penis.
4251155	4252315	I saw that, that was funny.
4253356	4255156	Remember the penis age in Second Life?
4255637	4256377	This is real life.
4257217	4260038	That is so stupid, and you guys are like laughing.
4261239	4262039	How old are you?
4262439	4263159	How old are you?
4263359	4263719	Five?
4264360	4264720	Six?
4265380	4266460	It has to do with gaming.
4267301	4269241	Is it a chess champion speech?
4270002	4272443	I thought it was, yeah, they had that on Best Week Ever.
4273163	4274483	I'm sorry, Ranma, for that.
4275043	4279265	Is there anything else you wanted to share besides the flying penis copter, as SackDeft calls it?
4281601	4282121	No comment.
4282702	4283822	Alright, take care, Ranma.
4284402	4285583	Alright, bye.
4285883	4286263	Bye.
4288564	4290665	Stop distracting this show with your flying penises.
4290685	4291666	Hi, you're on Orange Fonz Radio.
4291686	4292506	Who's this?
4293527	4295227	It's GS68.
4295307	4296928	GS68, what is on your mind, my friend?
4296968	4298609	Do you have a flying penis?
4298629	4298769	I am.
4298829	4299429	It's anime.
4299990	4301250	Wait, are you at Fonime right now?
4302451	4303511	Yep.
4303611	4306052	Hey, you gotta get some noise.
4306092	4307713	Are you in the middle of a crowd or something?
4308934	4309094	Um...
4310390	4313392	Actually, no, I'm in the main area.
4314133	4314974	You're in the main area?
4314994	4316475	Are there like tons of people walking through there?
4317716	4320358	Over by the hall with the meeting rooms.
4321119	4323941	Dude, make a beeline to the vendor hall and make some noise for Orange Challenge Radio.
4323961	4325262	Yeah, you gotta make some noise for Orange Challenge Radio.
4325282	4325822	Alright, that's alright.
4325842	4328024	What, what, um, what, how's it going this year?
4328084	4328724	How is Fandomay?
4328744	4329525	What are we missing out on?
4330746	4333428	Um, it's, um, let's see.
4334849	4338652	This is a gaming room and a dealer's room, for better or for worse.
4339273	4339453	Hmm.
4341129	4346773	Have there been any awesome panels this year to make up for the loss of Orange Lounge Radio?
4367722	4385693	There's Banzai Arcade, which is basically a game show where you have a video game trigger and sometimes you're challenged to do a fantastic video game like 25 rings inside the hedgehog or beat the final boss of Sonic 2.
4387975	4388515	Interesting.
4391056	4392317	It sounds like you're having fun.
4392577	4395159	What are some of the craziest cosplays you've seen while you've been there?
4396876	4397537	Let's see.
4399238	4399798	Let me think.
4401859	4405562	There's this one mecha cosplay.
4405622	4409624	I forgot his name, but he had some lights on his outfit.
4409644	4410345	It was pretty cool.
4413026	4416789	I went to the hentai room for the heck of it.
4417129	4417950	It was hilarious.
4417990	4423913	Like, usually, I was doing, like, handshakes, and people were like...
4426203	4430907	and the freaking stuff they were showing.
4432128	4436312	Well, it sounds like you're having fun and you're going to continue to throughout the rest of the weekend.
4436352	4441376	So I'm sorry we didn't make it this year, but are there any OLR listeners that you've run into?
4442857	4446140	Unfortunately, I appear to be the only one that I know of.
4446821	4447601	Aw, sadness.
4447821	4449403	Some of the staff listens to our show.
4449423	4450003	I know they do.
4450664	4451745	They're all closet fans.
4451765	4451825	So...
4455721	4458884	I like the grassroots effort to get the ULR name out there.
4458904	4459725	Very well done.
4459745	4459865	Yeah.
4480399	4487083	I also had a Yoda over Circle Flasher logo, right?
4487343	4487763	Yeah.
4488964	4494427	Yeah, I think first day I had it in my back shoulder because I got an oversized back shoulder.
4495348	4498990	Like, it's big enough to carry a little card under my badge.
4499850	4500691	Oh, very cool.
4500731	4505413	We should make little somethings for people that go to anime conventions.
4505513	4508074	Ooh, I should look into that, like little stickers or something people can wear.
4508094	4511176	I was outside to check out the anime masquerade last night.
4511596	4512476	I didn't really like it.
4512837	4514017	Like, a lot of kids, like...
4515798	4526084	They tried too hard with the voice acting so it ends up sounding cheesy and horrible and there are too many like dance skits like too many people doing that freaking har har yukai dance.
4526164	4527885	I mean... It's still good.
4530126	4530706	I suppose.
4531286	4540732	But they're pretty awesome Mortal Versus Capcom skits where they replicated one of the... I think we used Shinko Hadouken Attack.
4541232	4543113	Like they replicated that with like...
4544072	4546875	and Wallace Delafade, which was pretty awesome.
4547576	4548817	It looked like a laser, I guess.
4551943	4553284	Mel B, our buddy Mel B, our buddy
4582000	4582841	I don't really know him.
4583221	4584622	Oh, well, he knows OLR.
4585743	4586303	Oh, I see.
4586383	4586683	All right.
4587024	4589265	We've got to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but have fun.
4589285	4589665	All right.
4589765	4591006	Run around, act crazy.
4592367	4592687	All right.
4593628	4594008	Take care.
4594068	4594609	See you around.
4595249	4596890	A call direct from Faname.
4597091	4597751	That's kind of cool.
4598011	4600473	I like these whole little live reports we're getting.
4602194	4603035	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4603055	4603335	Who's this?
4604690	4606390	Hi, this is SSJ100Matt.
4606430	4614772	Well, hello, SSJ100Matt, the winner of the OLR contest from a couple weeks ago for the GTA 4 console.
4615012	4618373	And we heard that you got at least one vote from another show, so that's good.
4619553	4620393	I know, it's awesome.
4620413	4621194	Things are looking good.
4621234	4621854	So what's up, buddy?
4622454	4623854	Nothing much.
4623894	4625474	Well, you know, I just wanted to call in.
4625494	4630055	I wanted to thank everyone who voted on my entry.
4630255	4631496	That would be everyone, SSJ100Matt.
4634002	4661404	you really kind of kicked butt in that competition you did a great job well yeah because you know I felt guilty because I know you guys called but I was on the road I was on a cross country trip we edited it out of the podcast they'll never know so but yeah I just wanted to thank everyone and it sounded like the all games people liked it and Scott and Mary Young and Jessica all liked it yes in the end they didn't vote for you but I think it's because they didn't get it
4662893	4668097	I hope you win, we're pulling for you We'll let you know, we're supposed to hear this week So we'll let you know
4691365	4691686	All right.
4691906	4693427	We're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get more calls.
4693467	4693767	Take care.
4693787	4695047	Okay.
4695087	4695448	Take care.
4695488	4695828	Bye-bye.
4695928	4699410	This is J100 Matt, who is our finalist in the Grand Theft Auto.
4699630	4702952	One of eight in the freaking world being made.
4704193	4704833	It's amazing.
4705273	4706274	Last-minute stories, Loki.
4706294	4706714	Do you have any?
4707535	4708475	Yeah.
4708735	4713238	There's apparently another WiiWare game that's coming, I guess, pretty soon.
4714298	4714459	And...
4716591	4725125	It's a WiiWare game called Last Flight, and apparently the game has to do with vampires on a plane.
4726482	4729284	I guess you are a culinary vampire hunter.
4730784	4731845	Culinary vampire hunter.
4731865	4742431	Players will have the option of playing, I guess, Anna, a Romanian who is on the same plane back to Europe and is on a mission to destroy her vampire father.
4743551	4743932	All right.
4743952	4744752	This game sounds awesome.
4744772	4747033	We're going to take one more call before we go tonight.
4747073	4747974	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4747994	4748314	Who's this?
4750375	4751756	Scott, you missed ASUN.
4753120	4754401	I did miss Asen.
4754501	4757303	I'm kind of sad, but I definitely want to go next year.
4757323	4758023	Wait, who is this?
4758964	4759744	This is Osfer.
4760165	4760785	Osfer.
4760865	4762066	Well, how was Asen?
4762086	4763487	We just had a report on Faname.
4763527	4764147	How was Asen?
4766168	4770411	Well, it was my very first convention, and it was a freaking blast.
4770851	4771111	Uh-huh.
4772672	4776495	Well... If you went to Artist Alley, you would have run into our official lesbians.
4778016	4781398	If you saw two girls, one with blue hair, you would have ran into them.
4782708	4782868	Oh, crap.
4782888	4783448	You gotta have blue hair.
4783468	4784109	I can't remember.
4784149	4784669	I had orange hair.
4784689	4785009	Yeah, wait here.
4785029	4786590	I'll post a link in chat so I have the pictures from it.
4786610	4786910	I saw Misty.
4806792	4811816	Yeah, I was in line for the Hal Kelly concert, and she walked by and she had her Pikachu hat on.
4811856	4815159	I'm like, hey, but she couldn't stick around because she didn't want to hold up the line.
4815620	4815900	Right.
4815940	4816901	Well, that's still pretty cool.
4817441	4821264	Oh my gosh, there's like an entire album of stuff.
4821304	4823006	Yeah, some of them are videos, too.
4823066	4825748	One of them is me with my orange hair on.
4825768	4827630	I'm doing part of the Har Har Yukai dance.
4828430	4829752	Wait, are you dressed up as someone?
4831013	4831213	Yeah.
4832116	4837621	Well, in one of them, I'm supposed to be Ichigo, but I didn't get the full outfit, so I'm just supposed to be him in a school uniform.
4839282	4846308	Then in another one, I'm standing next to my friend, who he was cosplaying Kenshin, and I'm supposed to be Kion from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
4846668	4846948	Huh.
4847409	4848670	I'm trying to figure out if this is you.
4852092	4853534	We're trying to look at the pictures here.
4853614	4854875	Oh, yeah, that looks like orangey hair.
4855135	4856096	That's probably him right there.
4856356	4856736	All right.
4857697	4858258	Very cool.
4858278	4859439	It sounds like you have fun.
4859459	4861040	Was there just like tons and tons of people there?
4863339	4864100	Well, yeah.
4864160	4867982	Isn't that like the fourth biggest convention in the United States or something like that?
4868022	4869403	That is an awesome Pyramid Head outfit.
4869423	4869744	Look at that.
4870004	4870404	That's hot.
4871705	4872806	Did you see that Pyramid Head cosplay?
4872826	4873927	I don't know if you're looking at the same one.
4873967	4874867	I looked at the pictures earlier.
4875147	4876208	Ah, very hot.
4876969	4879751	So, what gaming related things did you see there real quick?
4882152	4886175	Well, I didn't really get to play much because there was like huge lines for all the games.
4886996	4891359	But I mean, of course, there was like a huge station with all these like classic fighters like Street Fighter and just like
4891681	4892461	It goes on and on.
4892701	4894182	And then there's Brawl, of course.
4896342	4900083	For the arcade stuff, they had Beatmania 6 style, I think.
4900563	4903404	And then they have the new one, Gold.
4904784	4908665	But I didn't really get to play that because something was wrong with the 6 mix machine.
4908705	4910465	I put it in my quarters and they ripped me off.
4910525	4911585	I was just like, dang it.
4912445	4915226	But they had an in-the-group 2 machine.
4915706	4919467	But I think it had R21 or something because...
4920083	4922123	It had this whole opening preview video.
4922284	4923904	It said over 4,500 songs.
4924024	4925404	I'm just like, holy shit.
4925444	4928085	Yeah, somebody probably installed a hack on it.
4928105	4928485	Yeah.
4930005	4932066	Something, but oh my God, it was huge.
4932226	4934446	And then they had DDR Extreme, Pump It Up.
4936067	4936327	Yeah.
4937327	4938207	Sounds like fun.
4939087	4945009	All right, well, buddy, we're going to let you go, but I'm glad to hear your first con was a success, and yeah, we'll try to make it next year.
4945029	4946529	We definitely want to have a panel and all that.
4946989	4949650	Well, I don't know if we can all go, but those of us that can, we'll do something, so
4951004	4953125	Yeah, I'm already planning to go to OhioCon next.
4953665	4954045	Awesome.
4954245	4955045	Oh, now you're addicted.
4955265	4956006	All right, well, have fun.
4956026	4957706	All right, thanks.
4957886	4958287	Take care.
4958307	4960707	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
4960727	4961808	We've got to start wrapping up the show.
4961868	4963008	Any other last-minute stories, Loki?
4963548	4964509	Yeah.
4964589	4964969	Let's see.
4965049	4973552	Other than the vampires on the plane stuff, there is a certain game that is being rumored to coming out in August.
4974272	4976733	It also begins with an A. The game...
4978763	4981965	is rumored to be coming to stores in August.
4982165	4986607	Apparently this is coming from PlayAsia, who has the game listed for August 28th.
4987847	4995731	And apparently they got the date early before on Initial D's special stage, so they're saying maybe it's possible.
4998072	4999653	I haven't heard anything, so I don't know.
5000113	5000333	Maybe.
5002890	5031689	and then for those of you who emulate your games on your PC EPSXE 1.70 has finally been released after about 4 years of no updates there and now they've added a bunch of support now multiple changes done to the pad support some more ISO support code being rewritten and apparently a lot more games are now compatible with it so that's pretty cool
5032929	5053295	and let's see here I was going to say also there's a website the slobsofgaming.com they have since we're talking about anime conventions here the 11 most scorching hot female cosplayers ever and you can check that out slobsofgaming.com and I'll copy that in the chat room as well
5054712	5069121	and let's see Duke Nukem 3D has now been converted to work on the PSP Slim so if you have your PSP Slim hacked in with homebrew ready software running on it you can now play Duke Nukem 3D which is pretty awesome
5071795	5098774	Infinite Undiscovery, the Square Enix game coming out on the Xbox 360 has been announced for a worldwide release on September 2nd so that looks pretty cool and Sam & Max Season 3 are going to be coming early 2009 Telltale is still interested in putting the games out on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network so hopefully we'll see those soon and I don't remember if we mentioned this earlier but
5099775	5100095	Carameldansen

5133548	5133988	So that's it.
5135389	5143934	About the Actraiser thing too, it was just basically, he's criticizing, I'd like to make an Actraiser sequel, that would be kind of fun.
5145135	5146296	It would be fun, do it.
5147016	5147356	It's super fun.
5147416	5148637	It'd be a lot of fun.
5150387	5152707	It came up when discussing WiiWare stuff.
5153148	5153888	God, I hope it's true.
5154988	5157608	Alright, we're going to put the nail in the coffin of this show now.
