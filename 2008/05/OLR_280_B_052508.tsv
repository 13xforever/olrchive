5440	11440	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11440	14540	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
14960	18960	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19620	25720	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. For this part B of our podcast, it is Sunday, May 25th, 2008.
25720	30120	Happy Memorial Day to those of you guys in the States who are celebrating Memorial Day tomorrow.
30120	32120	Hooray for three-day weekend.
32280	39900	You know, three-day weekends in the OLR world usually mean that we're gonna get drunk for Sunday nights, but not this year.
39920	43240	It's kind of, well, it's kind of a downer. Why not?
43240	46720	Well, Loki had to drive here and of course, you're not gonna drink and drive. That's not okay.
46720	51400	And Dark Soccer, you know, she's entertaining companies, so she doesn't want to be passed out while company is here.
51400	56940	And me, I'm not, I'm not allowed to drink medically right now because of everything I have with my pancreas.
56940	60900	I might have to stay away from alcohol for a long time. So, but that's okay.
61860	67700	You know, you don't need alcohol. You know, alcohol's fun when done responsibly, but you don't need it.
67820	74280	So, I'll live. But I do need Olive Garden, so I hope I can eat, you know, something besides vegetables again soon.
74780	75820	We'll see.
75820	78300	Those of you playing the drinking game at home, take a shot.
78300	80300	Why? Why do they, why do they take a shot?
80300	81300	Olive Garden.
81300	83100	All right.
83100	85940	Anyhow, we're gonna get back into the gaming news here on Part B.
85940	89660	If you missed Part A, you should go back in the podcast feed and listen to it.
89660	92420	Unless you're listening live on Sunday, then unless you can rewind time,
92420	95700	you're just gonna have to wait for Part A to hit the podcast feed, which should happen soon.
95700	99300	But in the meantime, We News, Loki.
99300	107700	Yes, we didn't get this game over here, but they had a music game in Japan that translated to Band Brothers.
107700	117300	And also in Japan, they will be getting a brand new sequel to that game, which is entitled Band Brothers DX.
117300	125700	And it will allow players to stream their best performances to their Wii for output through TV speakers, stereos, and home theater systems.
125700	132100	And to accompany this, the Wii is getting a new channel called the Speaker Channel,
132100	138100	which will allow you to do such, you know, things as that.
138100	140100	So, that's pretty interesting.
140100	150100	And also, I guess it's, the Band Brothers game, the original one is due out for the US as well, called Jam with the Band.
150100	155100	Or at least it was, but now don't know if that's still coming out.
155100	157100	What if I don't want to jam with the band?
157100	159100	Then you don't play this game.
159100	160100	What if I want to dance with myself?
160100	162100	But thou must.
162100	164100	I don't know.
164100	166100	So, it looks neat, I guess.
166100	168100	It sounds interesting.
168100	170100	Do you think it's something we might ever get here in the States?
170100	172100	Yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.
172100	174100	Nintendo likes releasing stuff here.
174100	180100	We didn't get the TV Guide channel, but granted, there's a whole nother reason for that.
180100	185100	Well, something from Japan that we are going to be seeing on the Virtual Console.
185100	192100	Thank you, ESRB, for spilling the beans on a few new releases that are going to be coming out.
192100	194100	Mega Drive had a game in Japan only.
194100	196100	It was called Glay Lancer.
196100	198100	Not gray, that's Glay. G-L-E-Y.
198100	202100	Glay Lancer came out, and that's supposedly going to be coming out here soon.
202100	209100	Konami had a game on the NES called Biomiracle Bakute Upa.
209100	216100	Both of those games are going to make their way if the ESRB is to be believed, which usually they are pretty reliable.
216100	221100	Also, just as an FYI, other games that were spotted on the ESRB's website, these aren't imports,
221100	225100	but pretty cool nonetheless, City Connection for the NES.
225100	227100	That was a Jellico game. I don't know if you remember that game.
227100	229100	It had the heart.
229100	231100	Dark Sakura will be happy about this.
231100	233100	Alex Kidd in Miracle World finally coming out.
233100	235100	I know it's not Shinobi World, but it's the next best game.
235100	237100	I was going to say yay.
237100	238100	Oh, you were?
238100	239100	Yes.
239100	241100	I thought you were going to complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.
241100	244100	I was going to say yay and then complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.
244100	245100	Alright, sorry, my bad.
245100	247100	God, Rob.
247100	249100	Don't put words in my mouth.
249100	252100	What's that game? It's not Rock Paper Scissors. What do they call it in Alex Kidd?
252100	253100	John Ken Pon.
253100	254100	John Ken Pon.
254100	258100	You can play that to your heart's content in Alex Kidd Miracle World.
258100	260100	Coming soon.
260100	262100	But now more news.
262100	265100	Because no ganous is good ganous.
265100	267100	Wait, wrong show.
267100	274100	Well, this is a story brought to me by the lovely and talented Tiara,
274100	280100	who is sitting next to me with her thumb in the air.
280100	286100	It's product placement done wrong.
286100	292100	There's this huge, massive Wii Fit, you know, humongoid thing.
292100	298100	And it's right over Chevy's in Times Square.
298100	301100	But isn't it healthy because it's like fresh mix and stuff?
301100	302100	Yeah, it's fresh mix.
302100	307100	You can have a big fucking burrito and a big fucking margarita as big as your head.
307100	309100	It's exactly what I said earlier.
309100	312100	And you could be healthy because you'll go home to Wii Fit.
312100	315100	Yeah, you won't care because you'll go home drunk and fall off the Wii.
315100	320100	Look, as long as I have a salad and bottomless chips and salsa, I'll be fine, right?
320100	321100	No.
321100	323100	But it's a salad, Jamie.
323100	324100	But I have to tell my Chevy story.
324100	326100	With avocado and sour cream, I'll be fine, right?
326100	327100	Sour cream.
327100	328100	You can't have sour cream.
328100	330100	You're nowhere sponsored by Chevy's.
330100	332100	I have a Chevy story, though.
332100	335100	All right, real quick, since we are orange lounge foodio.
335100	337100	I ordered a margarita.
337100	340100	It was a prickly pear margarita, and I ordered a small one, so you know it was massive.
340100	342100	And they spilled a third of it.
342100	344100	Oh, no, so I had to give you another one.
344100	345100	No.
345100	346100	What?
346100	349100	They refilled that third with tequila.
349100	355100	And I'm eating my seafood fajitas, which is probably the thing I get every time I go there.
355100	357100	Drinking down this hefty...
357100	359100	And you know me and tequila on top of that.
359100	363100	You know, it's like Drew said earlier, waffles.
363100	365100	Waffles, waffles, waffles.
365100	369100	You know the last time I had that much tequila anywhere near you guys, I passed out.
369100	373100	No, I threw up because everyone lit up in the living room at Tia's house.
373100	378100	And by the time before that, I ate half a box of waffles in your bed.
378100	380100	What?
380100	384100	Well, A, I just saw Guardian Legend on my TV, so I got distracted for a minute.
384100	385100	Shiny.
385100	388100	Loki's playing with all these things he shouldn't be on the Wii right now.
388100	389100	Sorry.
389100	390100	It's very distracting.
390100	394100	So now, from here on, I'm going to associate Wii Fit with Chevy's and, therefore, margarita.
394100	396100	So whenever I think of Wii Fit, I'll get drunk.
396100	397100	I'll tell you what, though.
397100	398100	I think the product placement is working.
398100	402100	I mean, maybe not in this particular case, but you can't find Wii Fit anywhere right now.
402100	403100	I missed launch day.
403100	405100	I slept through it or whatever.
405100	408100	And I didn't get the game when it came out, and I'll never get it now.
408100	409100	Right, Loki?
409100	410100	Probably.
410100	416100	It's in short supply right now because those Wii Balance boards are fucking hard to manufacture.
416100	422100	I was in GameStop in Las Vegas a few days ago, one of the most obese cities in the nation,
422100	426100	and there were like 75 Wii Fit boards just sitting there.
426100	427100	It was like they couldn't get rid of them.
427100	428100	Damn it.
428100	429100	Please take these.
429100	430100	Damn it.
430100	431100	I'm shopping in the wrong place.
431100	432100	Because people are like, money?
432100	434100	I have to gamble that away.
434100	437100	See, KikoMan2DX in chat says Wii Fit is in Costco.
437100	439100	I was just at Costco today, and no it wasn't.
439100	440100	I looked.
440100	444100	I mean, maybe in your neck of the woods, but not mine, sadly.
444100	451100	In regards to Wii Fit, just a little reference to the hardcore old school computer nerds out there.
451100	453100	Two words spring to mind.
453100	455100	Guru meditation.
455100	456100	Imagine that on the Wii Fit board.
456100	459100	How about dance aerobics?
459100	460100	That's old school for you.
460100	461100	That works too.
461100	462100	Dance aerobics.
462100	463100	Remember that game on the NES for the power pad?
463100	464100	Yeah.
464100	466100	Dance aerobics is hardcore.
466100	470100	Well, don't they have something like that coming out in Japan from Namco?
470100	472100	It's got like a little power pad thing.
472100	474100	Dude, they could do it with like real music now too.
474100	478100	They don't need those crappy little like, well, not that NES music was crappy because it wasn't,
478100	481100	but they could actually have like real songs in it and stuff.
481100	482100	You know, I could work out to Britney Spears.
482100	483100	It'd be fun.
483100	486100	Well, it would be fun.
486100	488100	For a minute.
488100	490100	For a minute?
490100	493100	Yeah.
493100	499100	This game may not be Wii Fit, and it certainly is not dance aerobics,
499100	503100	but coming to WiiWare soon is a game that is probably just as important,
503100	508100	and that would be the official beer pong game.
508100	509100	That's right.
509100	510100	Just what I needed.
510100	511100	Coming to the Wii.
511100	517100	In fact, according to the website features cup, ball, and beer in good times.
517100	520100	Two girls, one cup.
520100	521100	Right?
521100	527100	And anyways, so yeah, it will be coming to a Wii near you,
527100	531100	and also, I mean, shit, they have Game Party out right now,
531100	535100	which has a game called Ping Cup, which is essentially the same damn thing for 20 bucks,
535100	539100	but you know, if you want to pay $10 or whatever when this comes out,
539100	541100	you can go ahead and do that as well.
541100	548100	This is the first of a new games division from JV Games, their frat party games.
548100	550100	Frat party games, beer pong.
550100	553100	I'm sorry, why would you play beer pong without real beer?
553100	554100	I wonder if they're going to have...
554100	557100	Maybe you're not 21.
557100	559100	Then why would you be playing beer pong?
559100	562100	Frat party games in preparation for being 21.
562100	563100	That'd be pretty cool.
563100	566100	There's no point.
566100	569100	So no word on when it's going to come out or how much it's going to be,
569100	571100	but I can tell you right now...
571100	573100	Or how drunk you won't get playing it.
573100	576100	Yeah, how drunk you won't get.
576100	579100	I feel totally wasted right now.
579100	582100	Well, you can always add alcohol to it, so you know.
582100	588100	You may be in a cramped dorm and may not have room to set up a beer pong setup,
588100	591100	so you know what, this will help you out.
591100	592100	All right.
592100	595100	Well, if there's one thing in the world better than beer pong,
595100	600100	it's Spinal and Orchid and Glacius.
600100	601100	Was that his name?
601100	603100	Combo Breaker.
603100	607100	Combo Breaker and all those characters that were in Killer Instinct.
607100	609100	I'll be damned if this rumor doesn't come up once a year.
609100	613100	It's back, and it's thanks to EGM and the Quarterman.
613100	615100	He always has us call him an EGM.
615100	622100	Apparently, Rare is going to be making a third entry in the Killer Instinct franchise.
622100	624100	Of course, Rare has denied this before,
624100	628100	but apparently there is a game in the works, Killer Instinct 3D.
628100	630100	Death, Destruction, and Doom.
630100	631100	Get it? 3Ds.
631100	633100	Death, Destruction, and Doom.
633100	635100	It's apparently on the Xbox 360.
635100	636100	Will she still have the boob attack?
636100	637100	I hope so.
637100	638100	Yes, please.
638100	641100	Apparently, though, it will not be using the pre-rendered stuff
641100	643100	that was seen in the previous game.
643100	644100	There's kind of a bummer.
644100	650100	It'll just be 3D visuals and more robust gameplay, whatever that means.
650100	651100	Bigger bus.
651100	652100	Yay!
652100	653100	Bigger bus.
653100	656100	Because Maya had some pretty big busts.
656100	658100	I don't know if you saw that,
658100	660100	but that was a combo breaker of a different kind.
660100	663100	It should be more mobust replay.
663100	665100	Ultra combo me any day.
665100	667100	All right.
667100	668100	I don't know.
668100	670100	Take with a giant grain of salt,
670100	674100	but I don't think any of us would complain if this were true.
674100	675100	Right?
675100	676100	I know I wouldn't.
676100	679100	You know what they should do when there's a game that's being announced
679100	682100	that everyone's been rumoring for it to come out for a long time?
682100	686100	They should send everybody in the press a giant grain of salt.
686100	687100	That would be hilarious.
687100	688100	That would be fun.
688100	690100	Good idea.
690100	691100	I need a moment.
691100	692100	My browser just died.
692100	693100	Uh-oh.
693100	695100	So we can't get to the next story now?
695100	696100	I'm all over it.
696100	697100	What are we going to do?
697100	700100	The show has collapsed.
700100	702100	All right.
702100	704100	Quickly then, some more discussion.
704100	707100	Things you would most want to see in Killer Instinct 3.
707100	710100	What do you think Killer Instinct 3 needs more than anything?
710100	711100	Jubblies.
711100	713100	Banjo-Kazooie.
713100	714100	No, it does not.
714100	715100	As a character.
715100	716100	Okay, it's up.
716100	719100	All right, thank God.
719100	724100	There are supposed to be new colors for the DS in Europe
724100	730100	if anyone gives half a crap.
730100	734100	Puke green, according to Tiara.
734100	735100	There is.
735100	736100	Monkey snot.
736100	739100	I like how the article said slime green.
739100	741100	That's actually lime green.
741100	744100	Hot red and ice blue.
744100	749100	And it's supposed to have dates of June 13th.
749100	750100	But we don't know.
750100	751100	Hot red.
751100	752100	Ice blue.
752100	754100	Sounds like stripper names.
754100	755100	Hot red.
755100	756100	Lime green.
756100	757100	Oh, yeah.
757100	759100	That sounds like American Gladiators.
759100	764100	I was just thinking that.
764100	765100	Nice.
765100	771100	By the way, American Gladiators, one of those shows that's so bad it's good.
771100	773100	I watch American Gladiators every week.
773100	774100	Good times.
774100	775100	You would.
775100	776100	I love American Gladiators.
776100	777100	It's great.
777100	779100	I hope they make a new game.
779100	784100	All I have to say is that in the previews, Atlas Sphere is coming back this year.
784100	785100	By the way.
785100	786100	Thank God.
786100	787100	What?
787100	788100	My man won.
788100	789100	I am pleased.
789100	791100	The old American Gladiators season one?
791100	792100	No, American Idol.
792100	793100	Oh, American Idol.
793100	798100	I thought you didn't want him to win because then he would be stuck in the record contract.
798100	803100	I was sort of at half months because I wanted him to win so that David Archuleta's dad would
803100	805100	have an aneurysm.
805100	807100	Are we really having American Idol?
807100	808100	I'm not having this discussion.
808100	809100	All right.
809100	810100	Thank God.
810100	811100	Okay, I'm done.
811100	812100	All right.
812100	813100	Next topic.
813100	814100	Anyways.
814100	815100	So, yeah.
815100	817100	Something I've been distracted by lately.
817100	821100	The Wii Homebrew channel has been released.
821100	826100	Yes, they've gotten it so bad now to where they can inject their own channels into the
826100	827100	Wii.
827100	831100	And it's just insane the amount of stuff that you can do now.
831100	834100	Emulators, games, you name it.
834100	838100	It's available and hopefully I'll be demonstrating it a little bit later.
838100	839100	But yes, it is available now.
839100	844100	You can install it using the Twilight hack, which is actually pretty interesting in the
844100	845100	way it works.
845100	847100	But pretty simple to do.
847100	849100	There's instructions all over the internet.
849100	855100	So if you want to get your homebrew on while it, you know, works, feel free to check your
855100	860100	local Wii hacking community forums and you should be able to find it.
860100	861100	Yeah.
861100	864100	We reached out to Nintendo for some comment on what they were going to do about this situation
864100	867100	and what they had to say about this whole thing.
875100	876100	That's all they had to say.
876100	877100	Is this going to be the new sandstorm?
877100	879100	That's all they had to say.
879100	882100	No, because we can't drop E and rave.
882100	883100	It is quite sexy.
883100	885100	And hump the coin return of a potter potter machine.
885100	887100	They do have a bunch of stuff out for it right now.
887100	889100	You can get ScummVM for it.
889100	892100	They actually have a Tetris game that's someone's program.
892100	896100	There's emulators for practically everything Nintendo 64, Turbo Graphics, Game Boy Color
896100	899100	Games, NES, Super NES.
899100	904100	They have a region free player for GameCube games.
904100	906100	You can build that in there.
906100	911100	They've also got, you can upload Miis to it.
911100	914100	You can totally customize the stuff.
914100	916100	It's extremely easy to use.
916100	920100	And yeah, so more of that later.
920100	924100	Including the ability to play Guardian Legend.
924100	928100	Do you think that this, just real quick before we move on,
928100	931100	do you think this is something that they'll block in a future patch?
931100	934100	I mean, wouldn't this be very easy to close the hole in it?
934100	937100	They may be able to, but it's going to be pretty hard.
937100	940100	Or is this going to be like the PSP where it's ongoing?
940100	942100	I think it's going to be ongoing.
942100	945100	They haven't been able to block the Twilight hack thing,
945100	947100	so that's going to be hard.
947100	949100	Even if this homebrew channel thing gets blocked,
949100	953100	you can still use that Twilight hack to load almost anything you want.
953100	954100	This just makes it simpler.
954100	956100	It puts it all on your SD memory card.
956100	959100	Instead of having to load individual programs,
959100	960100	you can just keep it all on there.
960100	963100	Just visit this channel and load any homebrew programs you want.
963100	965100	And I think it looks pretty nice.
965100	968100	I mean, it's got the animations just like the other channels.
968100	971100	It's really professionally done.
971100	974100	Alright, well going back over to Nintendo for a little bit.
974100	977100	And Nintendo and Mistwalker's relationship.
977100	980100	You know, Mistwalker, of course, they have some games on the Xbox 360.
980100	983100	Kind of something interesting you may not realize.
983100	986100	Nintendo doesn't really have anything officially on the calendar right now
986100	988100	after Wii Fit has been out.
988100	990100	They're probably going to wait for E3 to really unveil
990100	992100	whatever else is coming out for the rest of the year.
992100	996100	But, thank you ESRB, who's given us a lot of news this week.
996100	1001100	The ESRB did rate a game called ASH, Archaic Sealed Heat.
1001100	1004100	And this is a game that's coming out on the Nintendo DS.
1004100	1007100	This is a game that already came out in Japan.
1007100	1009100	So if it's been rated by the ESRB,
1009100	1012100	then there must be a localization on the way.
1012100	1014100	But that is interesting because that shows that Mistwalker
1014100	1017100	is developing for more things than just Xbox.
1017100	1020100	But there is kind of that weird relationship with Microsoft's own studio
1020100	1023100	because there's the Viva Pinata game already announced for DS as well.
1023100	1027100	Well, THQ is doing a lot of those and same with the Blue Dragon DS game too.
1027100	1030100	Yeah, so it's not like Microsoft properties are afraid to go over to DS,
1030100	1034100	which I think further cements the fact there won't be a Microsoft handheld anytime soon.
1034100	1036100	So those rumors can just go away.
1036100	1040100	Did you hear about how they were originally thinking about adding connectivity
1040100	1045100	with Viva Pinata 2 and the Viva Pinata DS?
1045100	1047100	That would be very interesting, but could they do it?
1047100	1051100	Well, the way they had it done, it was only one way.
1051100	1056100	You could transfer stuff from your DS version to your Xbox 360.
1056100	1059100	And the way they did it was, I don't know, there was another story coming out
1059100	1062100	that they were going to have cards that you could buy
1062100	1064100	or something that would allow you to...
1064100	1066100	It's essentially like the Eye of Judgment card.
1066100	1068100	I was going to say, this sounds like Eye of Judgment to me.
1068100	1070100	But yeah, that's how the game would work.
1070100	1073100	It would produce a high resolution picture on there,
1073100	1075100	and then you would scan it with your camera.
1075100	1079100	Speaking of Eye of Judgment, I looked at the OLR Wiki this week,
1079100	1082100	where we've got awesome people maintaining the OLR Wiki
1082100	1084100	at orangelaunchradio.wiki.com.
1084100	1087100	You can learn a lot of stuff about the inside jokes of our show and everything.
1087100	1091100	Apparently, the Eye of Judgment has sold now 200,000 units.
1091100	1093100	We're one-fifth of the way there.
1093100	1095100	Never going to happen. Never going to happen.
1095100	1099100	I just love the fact that that's actually being tracked and updated on a regular basis.
1099100	1100100	Love it.
1100100	1101100	Start squirming, Loki. Start squirming.
1101100	1102100	Love it.
1102100	1103100	It's not going to happen.
1103100	1105100	It'll happen. All right.
1107100	1110100	Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news.
1110100	1112100	No, we're not. We're going to go to the mailbag, because...
1112100	1114100	I refuse.
1114100	1115100	It's probably very full. Too bad.
1115100	1116100	I refuse.
1116100	1117100	Too bad.
1117100	1118100	Then let the ferret read the emails tonight.
1118100	1119100	Hell no. I won't read.
1119100	1120100	Let TRR read them. I don't care.
1120100	1121100	We've got to do some emails.
1121100	1122100	No, the only one I'm going to read is hers.
1122100	1123100	All right, mailbag.
1123100	1126100	You're only going to read one email after two weeks being gone?
1126100	1127100	Yeah.
1127100	1128100	What do we want?
1128100	1129100	Plus a few others.
1129100	1130100	All right, thank you.
1130100	1132100	All right, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to participate.
1132100	1137100	TRR Sakura, open up the mailbag, pull out a few of your favorites, and read them.
1137100	1142100	This one says, dear people, my girlfriend wants a DS and a PSP.
1142100	1143100	She has a PS3.
1143100	1144100	Please use...
1144100	1145100	Oh, my God.
1145100	1146100	Please use a period.
1146100	1147100	Thank you.
1149100	1150100	Okay, what was I saying?
1150100	1151100	Oh, yeah.
1151100	1152100	I was wondering...
1152100	1155100	Did I mention when you email us, Jamie berates you?
1155100	1156100	I was wondering.
1156100	1157100	She's only 16, and I'm wondering.
1157100	1159100	You already said you were wondering.
1159100	1166100	If you had any ideas for a game to buy her, she'd love music, RPGs, and FPS.
1166100	1172100	What teen-rated games in those genre are good so I can make her a happy gamer girl?
1172100	1176100	Peace out, dsmaster25 and dsloverps.
1176100	1179100	We worship Hannah Montana.
1179100	1181100	Woeship, W-O-E.
1181100	1183100	I woeship her, too.
1183100	1187100	I would make a suggestion as for a good game to get her.
1187100	1188100	For the DS?
1188100	1189100	My word, coach.
1189100	1190100	Yes.
1190100	1197100	But you haven't really specified what system since you mentioned that she wants a DS and
1197100	1199100	PSP, indicating that she has neither.
1199100	1200100	Typing of the Dead.
1200100	1201100	And has a PS3.
1201100	1202100	Yeah, I get Typing of the Dead.
1202100	1205100	If they get a PSP, there's not a lot of music games available for it.
1205100	1208100	Actually, there's no music games available for it in the United States.
1208100	1209100	Guitar Man.
1209100	1210100	Guitar Man, yeah, that's about it.
1210100	1211100	Brappa.
1211100	1214100	I suggest getting her an Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip on it.
1214100	1215100	Ooh.
1215100	1220100	Our first person shooters, you're going to find a few of them on the PSP, not so many
1220100	1221100	on the DS.
1221100	1222100	Give her a baby.
1222100	1223100	It's what she really wants.
1223100	1224100	Give her Imagine Babies.
1224100	1229100	She can have my copy.
1229100	1230100	I played it.
1230100	1231100	You saw me play it.
1231100	1235100	Tell her you're getting ready for your long future together.
1235100	1238100	Anyways, so then I would, I don't know.
1238100	1240100	We're never going to get another email ever again.
1240100	1245100	If she already has a PS3, you might as well just stick with the PSP, because then you
1245100	1248100	can connect to it and download stuff via the PlayStation Store.
1248100	1249100	That's true.
1249100	1252100	There's also PlayStation 1 games that are available on there, and also if you want to
1252100	1256100	really hack the thing apart, you can play all the sorts of emulators and that kind of
1256100	1257100	stuff.
1257100	1260100	You can also do the same thing with the DS as well.
1260100	1262100	So, really, it's how much you want to spend.
1262100	1264100	The PSP is going to be more expensive for you.
1264100	1269100	Whereas the DS, you can find it cheaper and you can probably get a game for it for the
1269100	1270100	same price.
1270100	1271100	Right.
1271100	1275100	And then you can put, you know what, if you get a, the nice thing about the PSP versus
1275100	1278100	the DS is that you can set themes on the PSP.
1278100	1283100	So what you can do is you can put a picture of yourself in the background on the PSP so
1283100	1288100	that she can always take you with her wherever she goes as a constant reminder of your undying
1288100	1289100	love for each other.
1289100	1290100	There you go.
1290100	1295100	I also think that you should install a dictionary and a thesaurus and a grammar checker for
1295100	1296100	your phone.
1296100	1301100	I think that this is cool because I honestly think that this person is Russian or from
1301100	1304100	somewhere that uses the same form of alphabet.
1304100	1306100	I'm not really all that great with names.
1306100	1309100	But it's in the best screen cap ever.
1309100	1319100	It's a Google search to define STFU and definitions of STFU on the web, this is the only one that
1319100	1325100	came up, is a weekly half hour show hosted by, it brings up the stuff on the show.
1325100	1329100	Nice, so an old reference to the show that DMN hosted on the network.
1329100	1331100	Yeah, DJ Tyrant too.
1331100	1332100	Yes, and DJ Tyrant.
1332100	1336100	DMN, I don't think DJ Tyrant is involved with this, maybe it's a special guest or something,
1336100	1340100	but DMN has teamed up with Travis Donovan and they now do a show on All Games Radio,
1340100	1344100	if you haven't heard it yet, it's Under Sedation Live 4.0.
1344100	1350100	So it's the show that Jamie and I started on, all grown up and retarded.
1350100	1352100	I was the number one guest.
1352100	1353100	You were.
1353100	1355100	Plus I filled in for Jessica.
1355100	1357100	But now they're up to 4.0.
1357100	1358100	I filled in for you a couple of times.
1358100	1360100	Sure did, because I was lazy.
1360100	1362100	Where are they now? Rob Roberts.
1362100	1365100	I got to speak, sit in the speaker chair.
1365100	1366100	I just wanted to give a cheap plug.
1366100	1368100	Which we found the speaker chair.
1368100	1369100	Really?
1369100	1371100	At the Desiree thrift store.
1371100	1372100	Nice.
1372100	1373100	We checked.
1373100	1374100	Nice.
1374100	1375100	A few years ago.
1375100	1376100	Next email.
1376100	1378100	Okay, this one comes from Sauce.
1378100	1380100	Okay, wait, you have to explain for listeners.
1380100	1381100	Listeners don't know Sauce.
1381100	1382100	What is Sauce?
1382100	1388100	There are a group of us who have known each other for probably going on
1388100	1390100	over ten years online.
1390100	1395100	And Kim, who is one of the group, used to always call me Sis.
1395100	1398100	But she's like a terrible typer.
1398100	1400100	And she's like the typo queen.
1400100	1404100	So one day she typoed and instead of, she was trying to say,
1404100	1405100	Sits on Sis.
1405100	1408100	And she put Sots on Sauce.
1408100	1412100	And so ever since then, I've been Sauce. S-O-S.
1412100	1415100	And it just kind of, we made up names for everybody.
1415100	1417100	Like after that.
1417100	1418100	Very nice.
1418100	1421100	And mine is, when we get together, it's Soy Sauce Reunion.
1421100	1422100	Soy Sauce.
1422100	1423100	Cute.
1423100	1424100	It works.
1424100	1426100	So, hello Sos, Rob, and otherwise.
1426100	1431100	Girls are so weird, I swear.
1431100	1432100	Get ferreted.
1432100	1433100	Burn it.
1433100	1435100	Okay, this is the Uberlong review.
1435100	1436100	Alright.
1436100	1439100	I'm writing to give a review of the new Iron Man game that was
1439100	1442100	released on many platforms at the beginning of the month.
1442100	1445100	The version of the game I have is the PSP version and as such
1445100	1447100	the review is for that particular version.
1447100	1450100	Thank you for clarifying.
1450100	1453100	The game itself only has a small amount of storyline related to
1453100	1454100	the movie itself.
1454100	1457100	This may throw off players that have never read any Iron Man
1457100	1459100	or to a lesser extent Marvel comics.
1459100	1461100	But it's a great treat for true fans.
1461100	1463100	Subplots include such Iron Man favorites as,
1463100	1466100	I never pronounced this right, the Magia.
1466100	1470100	Whitney Frost, also known as Madame Mask and Titanium Man.
1470100	1474100	The bulk of the plot involves AIM.
1474100	1476100	I hate them.
1476100	1479100	I hate scrolls worse.
1479100	1480100	The story is good.
1480100	1483100	The graphics are more than fairly decent as is most of the voice
1483100	1484100	acting.
1484100	1487100	Tony Stark is much more brash and cocky than he is in the movie.
1487100	1490100	And even I was surprised by some of the things he said.
1490100	1493100	There are also plenty of unlockables to keep players busy
1493100	1496100	using weapons of three different types, repulsor,
1496100	1498100	gabbling gun and rockets.
1498100	1500100	Unlocks better weapons and progressing through the game
1500100	1501100	unlocks different armors.
1501100	1503100	There are of course the Mark 1 through 3 armors in the movie
1503100	1506100	plus the golden Avenger armor, the classic red and gold armor,
1506100	1509100	stealth armor and the titanium man armor.
1509100	1512100	Other unlockables include death races where you fly through
1512100	1514100	marker beacons as fast as possible while avoiding enemy
1514100	1517100	fire and speed kills where you see how many enemies you can
1517100	1520100	defeat before time runs out.
1520100	1522100	Now I can take a breath.
1522100	1524100	You were really busy.
1524100	1525100	Okay.
1525100	1527100	The drawback to this game, at least on the PSP,
1527100	1529100	is the way the player controls the game.
1529100	1531100	The controls are very uncomfortable and took me quite a bit
1531100	1535100	to get used to, especially the flying mechanics.
1535100	1537100	There is no option to change or rearrange the controls
1537100	1539100	to make them easier to use.
1539100	1542100	Using the square XO triangle buttons to control the camera
1542100	1546100	and analog stick to control pushing forward backwards motion
1546100	1549100	was very uncomfortable for me, especially since pushing up
1549100	1552100	on the analog stick makes you walk or hover forward,
1552100	1555100	but moving into flight mode makes pushing up on the analog stick
1555100	1559100	actually makes you go crashing down so it reverses from
1559100	1564100	standard running around mode to like jet controls.
1564100	1566100	Okay.
1566100	1567100	All right.
1567100	1569100	Whereas pushing down on the analog stick makes you pull back up.
1569100	1572100	I suppose in a way this makes sense, but the sudden reversal
1572100	1575100	of the controls makes flying a pain, especially when you wind up
1575100	1577100	running around and then jumping into flight a lot.
1577100	1579100	It took me two run-throughs of the training level
1579100	1582100	to get used to the controls, and even after 13 levels of play,
1582100	1584100	I'm still hindered by the awkward controls.
1584100	1587100	Overall, Iron Man for the PSP is a fun game.
1587100	1590100	The controls, however, definitely detract from it overall.
1590100	1594100	If you're a die-hard Iron Man fan like I am, then she is.
1594100	1596100	This is worth having in your collection.
1596100	1598100	However, if your knowledge of Iron Man is based solely on the movie,
1598100	1600100	I wouldn't bother.
1600100	1602100	My overall rating for this game is 6.5 out of 10.
1602100	1605100	Thanks, and keep up the great job with the show, T.R.I.P.S.
1605100	1608100	Rob is so eating cake on my birthday, frowning face.
1608100	1610100	We'll see. We'll see.
1610100	1612100	But that was a good review.
1612100	1615100	You should write reviews for our website whenever we get it working.
1615100	1617100	You should be. I already knew you were working.
1617100	1619100	Yes, ReviewWench.
1619100	1622100	Actually, Sauce has their own theme song, and so we can play it.
1622100	1633100	Can you hear me, darling? Can't you hear me? S.O.S.
1633100	1635100	No, I have to explain this.
1635100	1639100	Remember in the old days when I had my own show, Sniff Cry Wine?
1639100	1641100	Right.
1641100	1646100	I would randomly play the...
1646100	1651100	What was that group that did all the boob and dick songs?
1651100	1653100	I don't know.
1653100	1655100	Oh, no. Erotic.
1655100	1656100	Oh, Erotic.
1656100	1657100	I would play Erotic's version.
1657100	1658100	Yes.
1658100	1660100	But the tiger took my family.
1660100	1662100	That was... No.
1662100	1664100	I would play Erotic's...
1664100	1666100	But, no.
1666100	1668100	I would play Erotic's version.
1668100	1670100	No.
1670100	1672100	So that's officially... That is officially...
1672100	1681100	One Orange Jug video.
1681100	1684100	Boob, dick, boob, dick, boob, dick.
1684100	1688100	Come on, if you have something, come help me dodge your dick.
1688100	1690100	We know this well.
1690100	1692100	But this will come into play later.
1692100	1696100	You know, some day in your nightmare, somebody's gonna crop that little piece of show
1696100	1699100	and play that over and over.
1699100	1705100	They have a song called Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.
1705100	1706100	And the very first song...
1706100	1708100	And they were huge in DDR, by the way.
1708100	1710100	And the very first song I ever heard by them was before...
1710100	1712100	Was actually when I had played Beat...
1712100	1715100	Was still playing Beatmania 98 before we even had a 2DX.
1715100	1719100	Or when DDR was still just a thought.
1719100	1721100	Was Don't Talk Dirty.
1721100	1723100	It was like the best video.
1723100	1732100	Max...
1732100	1734100	What's the lyric?
1734100	1735100	That's the first part of the song.
1735100	1737100	Max, Max, call me Max.
1737100	1739100	I'm taking what it gives and I'm giving what it takes.
1739100	1740100	Max, Max, Max.
1740100	1741100	I'm in love with you and I want you.
1741100	1744100	I miss DDR when it was like at song play incidents.
1744100	1746100	I don't know what I'm gonna do.
1746100	1747100	I gotta warn you.
1747100	1749100	Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.
1749100	1751100	It will make your life complex.
1751100	1753100	Max, Max, Max.
1753100	1755100	These songs are available on iTunes, by the way.
1755100	1757100	And I highly suggest you buy the entire thing.
1757100	1759100	Buy the entire thing.
1759100	1761100	We cannot make this shit up.
1761100	1763100	Well, we could, but we're actually telling the truth.
1763100	1765100	We could, but, you know, yeah.
1765100	1766100	Next email!
1766100	1767100	Wait, hold on.
1767100	1769100	Just, I have to read the...
1769100	1771100	Look, I have the album Greatest Tits.
1771100	1774100	Here's the songs on Greatest Tits.
1774100	1776100	The horniest single in the world.
1776100	1778100	Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.
1778100	1780100	Willy Use a Billy Boy.
1780100	1781100	Help Me Dr. Dick.
1781100	1782100	Fred Come to Bed.
1782100	1783100	Turn Me On.
1783100	1784100	Gotta Get It Groovin'.
1784100	1786100	Gimme Good Sex.
1786100	1788100	Fritz Love My Tits.
1788100	1789100	Sex on the Phone.
1789100	1790100	Sexual Madness.
1790100	1791100	SOS.
1791100	1793100	The Winner Takes It All.
1793100	1794100	Baby Please Me.
1794100	1795100	And In the Dark of the Night.
1795100	1798100	Cause we all know what happens in the dark of the night.
1798100	1801100	We have booty calls all over the stuff.
1801100	1805100	We have two ABBA songs and, um, yeah.
1805100	1806100	So next email, okay?
1806100	1807100	I used to love Sex on the Phone, though.
1807100	1808100	This song was awesome.
1808100	1820100	But it doesn't have Don't Talk Dirty on it.
1820100	1822100	They have tons of albums.
1822100	1823100	It's not just the Greatest Tits.
1823100	1824100	There's just tons.
1824100	1825100	Next email.
1825100	1826100	Next email.
1826100	1832100	Dear Mailbag, like it can talk back, I'd like to think you all will have caught this piece
1832100	1836100	of news, but since it was tagged onto the end of another story, I want to make sure
1836100	1837100	you didn't miss it.
1837100	1841100	I know that Skye, at least, is a huge fan of Actraiser.
1841100	1844100	And there's a link that says, loves you, Apollo.
1844100	1848100	This message is not brought to you by Taco Bell because it is gross.
1848100	1852100	It's on Gamasutra.
1852100	1854100	I like what I'm hearing already about Actraiser.
1854100	1861100	Square Enix is talking about WiiWare and new Actraiser possibilities.
1861100	1863100	Like an Actraiser game on WiiWare?
1863100	1868100	I will save this for the end of the show.
1868100	1869100	That's awesome.
1869100	1874100	I will make you wait in anticipation.
1874100	1875100	Thanks.
1875100	1878100	I'm not going to say anything.
1878100	1881100	Until Rob decides to play me some more Erotic.
1881100	1882100	You want some more Erotic?
1882100	1883100	No.
1883100	1888100	So that means you have to wait a really fucking long time.
1888100	1893100	Actually, do you have some?
1893100	1894100	Do I have Don't Talk Dirty?
1894100	1895100	I don't know.
1895100	1896100	You should play it after the show.
1896100	1897100	If I can find it.
1897100	1898100	I don't know if I have it.
1898100	1899100	We'll see.
1899100	1900100	Next email.
1900100	1918100	This is an iTunes sample.
1918100	1920100	It doesn't have the actual chorus in there.
1920100	1921100	Don't Talk Dirty was great.
1921100	1928100	Is the music in the background of your FUs of the Week,
1928100	1930100	Jumpman by Buckethead, or did you remix it?
1930100	1931100	I know.
1931100	1933100	I remixed it from Jumpman by Buckethead.
1933100	1934100	Oh, you did?
1934100	1935100	Okay.
1935100	1939100	Pointless question by TJ Zeppelinz in the chat.
1939100	1942100	And since I wasn't on the mic, I remixed that from Jumpman by Buckethead.
1942100	1943100	Yes.
1943100	1945100	That was where my O came from.
1945100	1946100	Hey.
1946100	1947100	Hey, you.
1947100	1949100	Get out of my car.
1949100	1950100	Hey, listen.
1950100	1953100	Yesterday I listened to the Bobby Black Wolf Show and OLR
1953100	1955100	on the PSP's official internet radio player.
1955100	1958100	The quality was really good and there were no interruptions
1958100	1961100	except for the times I disconnected and tried to reconnect.
1961100	1962100	I have a couple of questions.
1962100	1965100	One, is there any way to set the presets on the player?
1965100	1970100	Is there another player that will work on the official Sony firmware?
1970100	1973100	Sometimes it was hard to find the all-game stream.
1973100	1975100	Sadly, I don't think there is.
1975100	1979100	I've played with that whole thing limitedly on the PSP.
1979100	1981100	I don't think there is a way to do it, sadly.
1981100	1984100	The PSP thing is very limited.
1984100	1987100	It sucks.
1987100	1989100	Rob, you are a pain in my neck.
1989100	1990100	Sorry.
1990100	1991100	It's okay.
1991100	1992100	Two.
1992100	1999100	And for your intro.
1999100	2000100	Anyhow.
2000100	2001100	I need a ferret.
2001100	2002100	Hey, listen.
2002100	2003100	Hey, listen.
2003100	2006100	Hey, listen.
2006100	2007100	Thank you, Rob.
2007100	2008100	Two.
2008100	2011100	Is there any PSP-compatible way of IRC chatting?
2011100	2015100	Listening live is great, but I want to chat, too.
2015100	2017100	Alpha Canagram says it's called Free Play.
2017100	2018100	It works for official firmware.
2018100	2020100	I'm using it now and he's in chat, so.
2020100	2021100	Okay.
2021100	2025100	I also posted this in chat because I think the PSP and other devices
2025100	2028100	could eventually be portable Internet radio devices
2028100	2031100	that could receive shows from all over the world.
2031100	2032100	And the next question.
2032100	2036100	When is the fuck show going to happen or has Black Wolf already shot that one down?
2036100	2039100	Well, I guess Understudiation Live 4.0 does have that one every Saturday.
2039100	2040100	LOL.
2040100	2042100	Thanks, PKJunior92.
2042100	2044100	No matter where you go, you're there.
2044100	2046100	We've said fuck and half a lot this episode, though, haven't we?
2046100	2049100	If we told you when it was, that would break the rules of the fuck show.
2049100	2051100	Yes, the fuck show is a surprise.
2051100	2052100	I will tell you when it is not.
2052100	2056100	The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.
2056100	2059100	And the sixth anniversary show is going to be...
2059100	2061100	Whatever the fuck we want it.
2061100	2062100	June...
2062100	2063100	On the sixth anniversary.
2063100	2064100	It can either be the...
2064100	2065100	Probably the 22nd is the closest.
2065100	2068100	June 22nd will be our sixth birthday.
2068100	2069100	So I don't know what we're doing for that yet.
2069100	2070100	Wow.
2070100	2071100	Yeah.
2071100	2072100	Sixth birthday.
2072100	2073100	Wow.
2073100	2074100	Yeah, I know.
2074100	2075100	For real.
2075100	2076100	Our show is old enough to be in first grade.
2076100	2077100	Wow.
2077100	2080100	Six years ago, Orange Launch Radio started.
2080100	2081100	I know.
2081100	2082100	It's crazy.
2082100	2083100	Fuck.
2083100	2086100	That's what I said.
2086100	2088100	All right.
2088100	2089100	So...
2089100	2090100	Next email.
2090100	2091100	Oh my god.
2091100	2092100	I've got three left.
2092100	2093100	Okay.
2093100	2097100	I'm trying to be nice because we weren't here last weekend.
2097100	2098100	Is there...
2098100	2099100	Okay.
2099100	2100100	Oh, we have one called...
2100100	2101100	Hello.
2101100	2102100	Hello.
2102100	2104100	Is there anyone there?
2104100	2106100	Have you fallen off the world?
2106100	2107100	I miss you.
2107100	2108100	Sad face Rick from UK.
2108100	2112100	I think that was when our stream went forever with no new updates.
2112100	2114100	Part B went out on Friday or Saturday.
2114100	2115100	So hopefully...
2115100	2116100	Yes, we're still alive.
2116100	2117100	Rob had the plague.
2117100	2118100	Yes, I had SARS.
2118100	2119100	No, no, no, no, no.
2119100	2121100	They put him on the cart even.
2121100	2124100	He was about to get carried off to the incendiary area.
2124100	2127100	But then you said he was going to go out for a walk.
2127100	2128100	I actually would.
2128100	2130100	When I was in the hospital, I remember being rolled around on a bed.
2130100	2132100	It was kind of an interesting experience.
2132100	2133100	I never really had that before.
2133100	2134100	Did you...
2134100	2135100	I'm not quite dead yet.
2135100	2136100	I feel happy.
2136100	2141100	I remember them rolling me out of the ER, into the room with the ultrasound, and rolling
2141100	2142100	me into the CAT scan room.
2142100	2143100	Did you hallucinate?
2143100	2144100	Huh?
2144100	2145100	Did you hallucinate?
2145100	2146100	No.
2146100	2147100	Poor Rob.
2147100	2149100	I can make you hallucinate right now.
2149100	2151100	Sometimes I think doing this show is hallucinating.
2151100	2152100	We could bring Shermy over.
2152100	2155100	She could fart on you.
2155100	2157100	Next email.
2157100	2158100	My cat got it back.
2158100	2160100	I was going to say my cat pooped the rubber band today.
2160100	2164100	I'm so fucking proud.
2164100	2167100	I am so fucking proud of you.
2167100	2168100	Shermy's not proud of her.
2168100	2169100	I'm not really.
2169100	2171100	Is that what this show is resorted to?
2171100	2173100	But cats are like your children.
2173100	2174100	Fuck!
2174100	2179100	Coming up in Wii news, oh my cat pooped out a rubber band today.
2179100	2182100	I'm very concerned because that means she ate a rubber band.
2182100	2186100	It could have killed her.
2186100	2187100	My cat eats grass.
2187100	2188100	She loves grass.
2188100	2191100	Seriously, fuck this show.
2191100	2193100	Can I read the next email?
2193100	2194100	Sure.
2194100	2195100	I don't care anymore.
2195100	2197100	Sauce says I can't so this segment's over.
2197100	2198100	Okay.
2198100	2202100	Hello everyone in the world.
2202100	2206100	We may as well be fucking doing a drunk show because we're all lunatics.
2206100	2207100	Seriously.
2207100	2210100	I would be drinking right now if it wouldn't kill me.
2210100	2214100	For those of you who do not know me, I don't know you so okay.
2214100	2215100	No, I'm kidding.
2215100	2220100	My name is Chris Phillips aka ChrisPhil1724.
2220100	2221100	Hi Chris.
2221100	2222100	Must be a really old school name.
2222100	2225100	A tournament slash event organizer for all games and all games.com.
2225100	2227100	Oh yeah, he used to do video stuff for all games.
2227100	2228100	I know he is.
2228100	2232100	He's a good man, Charlie Brown.
2232100	2234100	Don't cough up a rubber band.
2234100	2236100	No.
2236100	2238100	It was something a lot more delicious, Rob.
2238100	2239100	All right.
2239100	2240100	I'm going to get cookies.
2240100	2241100	Yum.
2241100	2243100	Anyway, on July...
2243100	2245100	Do the fanfare.
2245100	2249100	I got to find the...
2249100	2251100	This means fanfare.
2251100	2255100	I don't have a fanfare so this will have to do.
2255100	2264100	I'm July 24th, 2005.
2264100	2268100	Bobby Black Wolf aired his first live show on all games radio.
2268100	2270100	Known as The Bobby Black Wolf Show.
2270100	2274100	This show was, in fact, the first ever weekly podcast on all games radio.
2274100	2281100	Ever since that date, The Bobby Black Wolf Show has aired a new show every Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, 5 p.m. PST.
2281100	2285100	A streak that has lasted nearly 35 months.
2285100	2293100	This weekend was marked as the first week in 147 weeks without a new episode of The Bobby Black Wolf Show ending his remarkable run.
2293100	2299100	Now Bobby would never broadcast this noteworthy accomplishment and we may not even like the fact that I'm doing this.
2299100	2303100	There's fellow podcasters, you all know how hard it is to do a show week in and week out.
2303100	2308100	To that end, my fieldless achievement is worth mentioning and congratulations are in order.
2308100	2310100	If you'd like to write a small email to Bobby or...
2310100	2312100	Oh my god, I'm sorry.
2312100	2313100	We're doing it live, Bobby!
2313100	2317100	Yay!
2317100	2320100	Well done, Darth Zagre.
2320100	2322100	Let's hear it for Bobby Black Wolf.
2322100	2329100	Let's hear it.
2329100	2332100	I was looking for the moaning noises, but alright.
2332100	2335100	No, that is a good accomplishment.
2335100	2340100	It really is. I mean, god, we're lucky if we go ten weeks.
2340100	2341100	Alright.
2341100	2344100	Dear OLR and Loki 2.
2344100	2347100	You know how that's gonna go.
2347100	2351100	You're going to know in the first four words how that's going to go.
2351100	2355100	I have a Macintosh and I don't use it to play games.
2355100	2360100	I can understand why Loki would not like a Macintosh computer because he uses his computer to play video games.
2360100	2364100	Now can we shut up about this whole Loki hates Macintoshes thing?
2364100	2367100	They just don't deserve, they just don't serve his needs.
2367100	2369100	To be honest, we sort of dropped this long ass fucking time ago.
2369100	2372100	It's the listeners that keep bringing it up.
2372100	2373100	Am I right?
2373100	2377100	Well, once in a while there'll be a story and he'll make a snide comment that reminds us.
2377100	2381100	But I don't think there's been a good old fashioned brawl over it in a while.
2381100	2384100	The only people bringing it up is the fucking Mac users.
2384100	2388100	My wife does this every time a stupid Mac commercial comes on TV.
2388100	2390100	She's like, see, they said it's true.
2390100	2392100	I'm like, shut up.
2392100	2394100	It's on TV, it must be true.
2394100	2397100	I'll never forget when the Mac fan came to Fauna Mae.
2397100	2399100	Aw shit, I remember that last year.
2399100	2402100	Which, by the way, notice we're not at Fauna Mae this year.
2402100	2404100	It has other things to do.
2404100	2406100	It was a conspiracy by Mac users.
2406100	2408100	No, we'll be back at Fauna Mae next year, I promise.
2408100	2410100	We have to.
2410100	2413100	If we're still around. My god, we're getting old.
2413100	2414100	You are.
2414100	2416100	If we don't die of old age first.
2416100	2418100	You're gonna die of the plague.
2418100	2419100	Thanks.
2419100	2420100	I'm gonna die of awesome.
2420100	2421100	Dr. Mario will cure it.
2421100	2422100	I'm gonna die of awesome.
2422100	2424100	Alright, are you gonna read any more of this email?
2424100	2426100	Should I?
2426100	2428100	Pick a paragraph. Read a paragraph.
2428100	2430100	That's not why I wrote.
2430100	2432100	I wrote because I have a few things I want to say about Nintendo.
2432100	2434100	Okay, whatever.
2434100	2436100	Um.
2436100	2440100	It's basically saying that Nintendo sells a lot of stuff.
2440100	2442100	The end.
2446100	2448100	Maybe you should post that on the super long email of the weak thread.
2448100	2451100	I'm actually going to do that because right now my throat hurts.
2451100	2456100	And it actually is from Hippolytus, aka Black Boy, who we remember.
2456100	2457100	Yes.
2457100	2461100	You are actually going to be the person who brings back
2461100	2466100	The long ass fucking email thread of the weak.
2466100	2468100	On OrangeDownsRadio.com
2468100	2469100	Congratulations.
2469100	2471100	I want to be the person who brings sexy back.
2471100	2472100	Does this call for fanfare?
2472100	2473100	Yes.
2473100	2476100	Just because honestly, honestly, honestly.
2476100	2480100	It's a good email, but my throat hurts a lot.
2480100	2484100	I will post it on the forums and link it in the chat room.
2484100	2486100	Long email is long.
2486100	2487100	Yes.
2487100	2488100	Long email is very long.
2488100	2489100	Long email is long.
2489100	2493100	If you want to send us long emails, mailbag at OrangeDownsRadio.com
2493100	2495100	Meantime, more gaming news.
2495100	2496100	Yes, Loki?
2496100	2497100	Yes.
2497100	2498100	Um.
2498100	2500100	I was just reading something else that's kind of interesting.
2500100	2502100	But this is sort of interesting.
2502100	2504100	It'd be more interesting if it weren't the end gauge.
2504100	2505100	But yes.
2505100	2507100	Ear taco.
2507100	2513100	Metal Gear Solid Mobile has somehow found its way on the end gauge.
2513100	2514100	That's right.
2514100	2517100	You will be able to play Metal Gear Solid.
2517100	2522100	The winner of two 2007 International Mobile Gaming Awards.
2522100	2531100	And apparently it's coming to the end gauge shortly after the launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 for the PS3.
2531100	2535100	So that's cool I guess.
2535100	2540100	At least they're getting some actual big name games.
2540100	2542100	The end gauge is still around.
2542100	2545100	Yeah.
2545100	2548100	Well, do you remember Nolan Bushnell?
2548100	2549100	I hope you do.
2549100	2551100	Yes, because he gave us Pizza Time Theater.
2551100	2552100	Yes.
2552100	2553100	And Chuck E. Cheese.
2553100	2554100	Right?
2554100	2555100	That was Pizza Time Theater.
2555100	2556100	Well, whatever.
2556100	2557100	The name better.
2557100	2558100	And Pong.
2558100	2559100	Pizza Time Theater.
2559100	2560100	Right?
2560100	2561100	Yes.
2561100	2567100	Well, he apparently was speaking at the Wedbush Morgan Securities Annual Management Access Conference.
2567100	2571100	And he's saying the game piracy, it's on its way out.
2571100	2579100	It says, quote, there is a stealth encryption chip called the TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now.
2579100	2586100	What that says is that in the games business we will be able to encrypt with an absolutely verifiable private key in the encryption world,
2586100	2594100	which is uncrackable by people on the internet, and by giving away passwords which will allow for a huge market to develop in some of the areas where piracy has been a real problem.
2594100	2595100	It's not going to work.
2595100	2596100	Why is that?
2596100	2598100	Because everything can be cracked.
2598100	2601100	And the fact that you said that it can't be cracked is just going to make people want to crack it.
2601100	2603100	It is an invitation to the crackers to say please crack this.
2603100	2604100	Trust me.
2604100	2607100	If it can be modified, it will be modified on the board.
2607100	2610100	Or they'll find a way to emulate it and they'll just disable it.
2610100	2612100	There are ways to do everything.
2612100	2614100	It has been done before.
2614100	2619100	What I did think was interesting is that he does say, though, that movies and music, though, that's unstoppable.
2619100	2621100	Quote, if you can watch it and you can hear it, you can copy it.
2621100	2625100	He says games are a different thing because games are so integrated with the code.
2625100	2629100	The TPM will, in fact, absolutely stop piracy of gameplay.
2629100	2637100	As soon as the installed base of the TPM hardware chip gets large enough, we will start to see revenues coming from Asia and India at a time when before it didn't make sense.
2637100	2640100	Or they'll just stop buying games altogether.
2640100	2646100	Of course he wants to say that it can't be cracked because he wants to sell it to, you know, said companies that make motherboards.
2646100	2650100	Obviously they want to do that because, you know, ideally it should work.
2650100	2656100	But the problem is people out there want to steal games more than, you know...
2656100	2659100	I mean, look at this. Okay, put it this way.
2659100	2667100	There are games out there now that have it, you know, where you have to play it, you know, and it talks to a server online to validate that it's an official copy of the game.
2667100	2669100	Those have been cracked.
2669100	2674100	You know, there's stuff on the PSP that they've had countless firmware upgrades that are supposed to prevent piracy and stuff.
2674100	2676100	Those have all been cracked.
2676100	2677100	I mean, what makes...
2677100	2683100	Rama in chat, chat.orangesonshooter.com says, Intel tried that with their Pentium 3 chips and boards. It didn't work.
2683100	2691100	Yeah, I mean, it's a nice attempt and, you know, people should be a little bit more legit with stuff, but it's just not gonna happen.
2691100	2694100	It really isn't, so...
2694100	2696100	I don't know.
2696100	2700100	Just because you stop people from pirating a game does not mean that they are gonna go buy your game.
2700100	2702100	That's the other problem too.
2702100	2709100	Because they're assuming that people that are pirating these things had intended to buy it in the first place.
2709100	2710100	That's not always the case.
2710100	2714100	That's a good point. I think a lot of pirates probably wouldn't even bother buying the games.
2714100	2716100	I really think that.
2716100	2722100	But it sounds like maybe he's trying to combat piracy in other countries, not necessarily just the US, but where it's way more rampant.
2722100	2724100	You think that might be the case?
2724100	2733100	Good luck. I mean, but, you know, if anything, you know, the Chinese and stuff, they've gotten piracy down big time, so...
2733100	2737100	I don't see this affecting much.
2737100	2745100	Alright, well, I don't know about you guys, but I get the feeling we've heard this all before, and when I hear things and I don't see results, I get irritated.
2745100	2763100	And when I get irritated, we do the FUs of the week.
2763100	2765100	FU to the dollar store.
2765100	2769100	We went to get a USB cable, and there were none out on the shelf.
2769100	2775100	The whole supply of them wasn't there, so I asked if someone would go and look in the back and see if there were any.
2775100	2779100	Just about any other store I go to, people are willing to look in the back and just, oh, we don't have any.
2779100	2781100	That was it.
2781100	2782100	Loki.
2782100	2787100	FU to the virtual friends in Grand Theft Auto IV.
2787100	2793100	I don't want to go do activities with you. That's why I'm not calling you back, you idiots.
2793100	2795100	But at least they have sleep mode.
2795100	2796100	You do know it's a video game, right?
2796100	2801100	Yes, it's still annoying, though, when you have people going, I haven't heard from you forever, I want to go drinking.
2801100	2805100	It's like, fuck that, I have to shoot pigeons.
2805100	2807100	So they don't understand.
2807100	2817100	My FU of the week goes to the antibiotic C-Pro, which I was taking because the doctor thought I had an infection, even though I'm pretty sure I had a virus based on the high fever I had and the fact that the antibiotics didn't really work.
2817100	2826100	But I was taking it for so long that finally my chest started to tighten up and I got a big ol' red rash on my chest, so I stopped taking it.
2826100	2830100	Because that's not a good reaction to have, especially when you just have pancreatitis.
2830100	2832100	So I chose to stop taking it.
2832100	2834100	So FU to C-Pro.
2834100	2836100	Drunami.
2836100	2842100	FU to friends, so-called friends who make their mission in life to bring your ass down.
2842100	2844100	I'm not naming names.
2844100	2847100	No one, anyone here would know.
2847100	2853100	FU to rock band and all its goodness for making my throat hurt like hell.
2853100	2856100	And...
2856100	2858100	FU to Mellow Gear Solid 2.
2858100	2860100	Stop busting me.
2860100	2861100	Alright.
2861100	2862100	Just because I suck.
2862100	2864100	Chiaraara.
2864100	2866100	Anything you want to say FU to?
2866100	2867100	I'm good, thanks.
2867100	2868100	Aw.
2868100	2870100	FU to you for being so happy.
2870100	2872100	Yeah, really, we're jealous.
2872100	2873100	I know, what's your secret?
2873100	2874100	Alright.
2874100	2876100	That's gonna do it for the FUs of the Week.
2876100	2879100	Let's get back into some gaming news.
2879100	2881100	DarkSakura's gonna take it.
2881100	2882100	Well, she's coughing.
2882100	2884100	I just wanted to ask, are you sure you didn't have anthrax?
2884100	2886100	Because C-Pro is what they give you if you have anthrax.
2886100	2887100	For real, huh?
2887100	2889100	No, I do not have anthrax, thank gosh.
2889100	2891100	I do have an anthrax CD somewhere.
2891100	2894100	Did you start developing the rash, like, as soon as you started taking it?
2894100	2895100	No, it was about five days into it.
2895100	2896100	Five days into it?
2896100	2897100	Yeah.
2897100	2898100	Of course you didn't have anthrax.
2898100	2899100	It does suck.
2899100	2900100	It does suck.
2900100	2904100	But I've been to the doctor so much in the past two months, I couldn't go back over the rash.
2904100	2906100	I was just like, you know what, I feel fine, I'm just not gonna take it.
2906100	2910100	I have some drug stuff to talk to you about after the show, too, because I know drug stuff.
2910100	2912100	Yay, drugs!
2912100	2913100	Drugs are rad.
2913100	2914100	Yeah!
2914100	2915100	Alright.
2915100	2917100	There's a new Pokemon game coming out.
2917100	2919100	Yay.
2919100	2923100	This is like the scene where they say, and they ate Robin's minstrels and there was much rejoicing,
2923100	2925100	and they just go, yay.
2925100	2926100	Yay.
2926100	2927100	Yeah.
2927100	2934100	Koto Koto magazine said out word that there's going to be Pokemon Platinum,
2934100	2941100	and it's supposed to be a companion to Diamond and Pearl.
2941100	2943100	So, yay.
2943100	2946100	Pokemon, colors we haven't thought of yet.
2946100	2951100	I still like my Pokemans, but I have a feeling this will be just emerald all over again.
2951100	2953100	Pokemon's a good game.
2953100	2958100	I don't know, Platinum sounds like, I don't know.
2958100	2963100	I can't help but think of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
2963100	2971100	I played Pokemon Pearl for a while, but I only played it at the gym while I was riding the recumbent bike.
2971100	2979100	So, apparently the casting has, or some rumors about casting have come out about the Prince of Persia movie,
2979100	2985100	and Jake Gyllenhaal is now reported to be the Prince of Persia.
2985100	2987100	Wow, that's so Persian.
2987100	2990100	I know, totally.
2990100	2994100	Dude, Bubble Boy is the Prince of Persia, that's pretty awesome.
2994100	2997100	Bubble Boy was on TV the other day.
2997100	3000100	I've watched that way too many times.
3000100	3003100	But, yeah, I don't know.
3003100	3007100	I can't be too excited about this.
3007100	3009100	He just looks too lethargic, I'm sorry.
3009100	3018100	He's just very like, I have to act.
3018100	3021100	As long as it's hot, like Brokeback Mountain, then we're fine.
3021100	3024100	I can't quit you, Prince of Persia.
3024100	3026100	Excuse me, a baking powder.
3026100	3032100	Speaking of video game movies, $200 million.
3032100	3040100	$200 million variety reports, Crystal Sky Pictures has signed this deal for $200 million financing,
3040100	3046100	and what this millions of dollars is going to be used, it's going to fund Castlevania,
3046100	3052100	a sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled, and Pac-Man, the movie.
3052100	3058100	So they're making Stranglehold the game, the movie, and then the game, because it'll come back around again.
3058100	3060100	What a horrible night to have a movie.
3060100	3065100	Now, look, we know that Castlevania has been, like, this has been off and on with Rider Strike and everything.
3065100	3072100	We know this was on the table, but seriously, Pac-Man, the movie, like, how in the hell is that going to work?
3072100	3075100	I mean, Pac-Man did have a TV show.
3075100	3076100	He's a trap act.
3076100	3078100	It was a cartoon. I guess if Pac-Man's a cartoon, it might work.
3078100	3079100	It's a dumb idea.
3079100	3080100	He's a pill popper.
3080100	3086100	It's a dumb idea, although we did throw around the premise of a Pac-Man movie.
3086100	3097100	One man in the future will save the world from Inky, Binky, and Clyde using dots.
3097100	3099100	Why are you talking like Triple H?
3099100	3100100	No, they...
3100100	3101100	It's the movie man.
3101100	3107100	No, what you would do is you would have a cop on the edge, you know, played by...
3107100	3108100	Oh, God, the guy...
3108100	3109100	Joe Pesci.
3109100	3110100	No, not Joe Pesci.
3110100	3114100	No, that'd be funny, though, but...
3114100	3115100	He knew too much.
3115100	3116100	No, no.
3116100	3119100	Now the ghosts of his past are after him.
3119100	3120100	Ah, Gerardimo wins.
3120100	3124100	He says the Pac-Man movie will have Kylie Minogue as Ms. Pac-Man and it'll be awesome.
3124100	3125100	That's a good point.
3125100	3129100	Lame.
3129100	3130100	Do not want...
3130100	3138100	Do not want...
3138100	3142100	Dark Sakura, what could they possibly do a Pac-Man movie about?
3142100	3143100	Have you ever seen the cartoon from the 80s?
3143100	3144100	Is there anything?
3144100	3147100	I think the cartoon from the 80s was great and there was Pac-Land.
3147100	3151100	Unless there was only one feasible way I could see this happening, right?
3151100	3154100	And it would not be a movie that they would be able to promote very well.
3154100	3159100	Is if they did a Pac-Man porno where they dressed everybody up in ridiculous costumes and made them have sex.
3159100	3161100	That's the only way this could work.
3161100	3166100	It's scary, but it's the only feasible way this could possibly work.
3166100	3167100	Not sure if want.
3167100	3176100	We reached out to Atari for comment on the Pac-Man movie and this is all they had to say.
3176100	3179100	Too bad it's Namco that's going to be taking care of that.
3179100	3181100	I...my theory...
3181100	3182100	It's a joke from like three weeks ago.
3182100	3183100	I know it is.
3183100	3184100	That was for the fans.
3184100	3185100	Wow.
3185100	3186100	I miss the bus.
3186100	3192100	I miss the bus, sorry.
3192100	3193100	What?
3193100	3195100	I feel it's going to be CG.
3195100	3196100	Probably.
3196100	3197100	Okay.
3197100	3200100	I feel it's going to be poop.
3200100	3204100	It's going to be a pooped out rubber band.
3204100	3205100	You know what?
3205100	3210100	You need to take that toilet paper joke book, turn it upside down.
3210100	3211100	I'm not going to say it.
3211100	3212100	You know, if...
3212100	3215100	Turn it upside down and turn that smith front.
3215100	3225100	SSJ100Matt says that Jessica Alba should be Mrs. Pac-Man, but that makes me think that all games, Jessica, if she doesn't get the role in that horror movie, she should make Ms. Pac-Man her next goal.
3225100	3226100	Come on.
3226100	3227100	I'm only recycling your material.
3227100	3228100	Come on.
3228100	3232100	If she doesn't win that, don't you think she's suffered enough?
3232100	3235100	I don't know.
3235100	3238100	All right.
3238100	3239100	More news, please.
3239100	3240100	Rob.
3240100	3241100	Can I have news?
3241100	3242100	No, you can't.
3242100	3244100	You can have...okay.
3244100	3252100	Well, for people who give a shit, and I'm not one of them, Postal's coming to Blu-ray in August.
3252100	3256100	Postal is that movie made by...what's his name?
3256100	3259100	Who did a bunch of shitty movies?
3259100	3260100	Uwe Boll.
3260100	3261100	Yeah, he sucks.
3261100	3264100	Sadly enough, I have this preordered already.
3264100	3265100	You do?
3265100	3267100	Why are you putting money in his pocket?
3267100	3271100	Loki just really wants to see Dave Foley's penis in high definition.
3271100	3272100	Don't you know it?
3272100	3273100	Totally.
3273100	3277100	No, actually, this movie looks so bad that I have to add it to my bad movie collection.
3277100	3278100	Yeah, it does look pretty bad.
3278100	3292100	To read the, I guess, synopsis of the movie, it's about a misfit who sets out to rob his local amusement park while getting mixed up with a faction of the Taliban.
3292100	3294100	I'm sorry, what?
3294100	3295100	Yeah.
3295100	3299100	It grossed less than five million.
3299100	3301100	Well, it's only in four theaters.
3301100	3303100	It grossed less than five dollars.
3303100	3305100	Which is a really nice way of saying that it made...
3305100	3309100	How did it even make five million? Are you sure it's not five thousand?
3309100	3314100	Well, first off, it just came out. I mean, literally this week, so...
3314100	3316100	We wish it would go back.
3316100	3321100	I don't know. I'd see it. But, see, because this looks actually semi-interesting to me.
3321100	3326100	I've watched an Uwe Boll movie before, the BloodRayne 2 movie.
3326100	3329100	Interesting premise. Execution was shit.
3329100	3331100	Loki, you're part of the problem.
3331100	3337100	Hey, I had to watch it in order to talk to Uwe Boll, okay? We interviewed him. That was fun.
3337100	3339100	You're part of the reason he keeps making this shit.
3339100	3344100	Hey, I didn't actually pay to see this movie. It was a screener.
3344100	3347100	But, yeah, I get to talk to him. It was cool.
3347100	3350100	He's making a game, too, by the way.
3350100	3352100	It's Tunnel Rat.
3352100	3354100	Hooray.
3354100	3361100	No, it's about, like, these guys that are in Vietnam and they go into the vehicle.
3361100	3363100	Oh, dude, Tunnel Rat was the name of the G.I. Joe.
3363100	3368100	Yeah, probably named for the same reason, but, yeah.
3368100	3370100	Talk about another movie that's gonna suck.
3370100	3376100	I was trying to see how much Postal made over the weekend, but it's not even on the top ten. Surprise.
3376100	3378100	I'm trying to think where we go to see that.
3378100	3380100	I looked at Box Office Mojo. I couldn't find it.
3380100	3385100	But I'm looking now for the Rotten Tomatoes score. Eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes for Postal.
3385100	3390100	IMDB sometimes has the actual, like, disease.
3390100	3394100	It has four screens. I mean, it can't do very- it's probably gonna do a million.
3394100	3400100	I'm looking at- not even that. I'm looking at positive reviews for Postal. Let's see.
3400100	3402100	Prairie Miller from News Blaze says,
3402100	3410100	Along the way to its parking lot showdown, a wacky property damage conspiracy to commit insurance fraud is uncovered between Osama and Bush.
3410100	3416100	The darker, zany recesses of America is viewed from the Twilight Zone. Move over, Barat.
3416100	3417100	What?
3417100	3420100	Let's see. Here's another positive review from Cam Williams.
3420100	3426100	I suppose since almost seven years have passed since 9-11, America might finally be ready to laugh at the tragedy.
3426100	3430100	Tasteless, profane, and far-fetched, but undeniably funny, too.
3430100	3433100	Dot, dot, dot. That's all I have to say.
3433100	3435100	Film Threat, Jeremy Knox.
3435100	3442100	It's not perfect and will get on the nerves of the more opinionated critics out there, but it's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.
3442100	3444100	Dot, dot, fucking dot.
3444100	3448100	Those are the three positive reviews, giving it an eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes right now.
3448100	3451100	I do have to admit, the poster is pretty funny.
3451100	3456100	I mean, it's offensive. It's highly offensive, but it's mildly amusing.
3456100	3466100	Alright. So, some interesting news. We've been hearing a lot of different publishers dropping out of both E3 and the ESA.
3466100	3472100	Well, there's another one dropping out of the ESA, and I think they're already out of E3, so it's not a big surprise there.
3472100	3477100	But id Software has actually dropped out of the ESA as well.
3477100	3487100	And they're joined, of course, with LucasArts, Activision, and Vividi. Or Activision Blizzard, which I still don't understand why they're still referring to them as two different companies.
3487100	3489100	But, whatever.
3489100	3497100	And it's unclear what their decision, why they decided to drop out of the ESA, but we do know that they're gone.
3497100	3503100	So, apparently, one more out the door. Interesting.
3503100	3507100	Any theories why this is happening, Logan?
3507100	3516100	I don't know. Maybe they just don't feel like ESA is representing them enough, or maybe they're just getting cheap and they don't want to pay the money to the ESA to help defend them.
3516100	3522100	And besides, I mean, think about it this way. It's like they're defending the game industry, okay?
3522100	3525100	And anybody that's joined up with the ESA has to pay them to defend the game industry.
3525100	3531100	Well, if you drop out of the ESA, they're still defending you, so it's like you're getting a free ride.
3531100	3536100	Robin Chat says the ESA business seems to be the beginning of a new consortium.
3536100	3539100	I don't know. It sounded pretty gay to me.
3539100	3542100	Why did you say that?
3542100	3546100	I mean, they're just freeloading on this shit.
3546100	3560100	Well, that's just my opinion on why they're, I mean, it makes perfect business sense if, you know, okay, well, I can eliminate this cost and they're still doing the work for me, so, as unethical as it is, eh, whatever.
3560100	3566100	Well, speaking of things that are pretty gay, Xbox Live has been going on a banning marathon lately.
3566100	3569100	A couple of bannings recently have caught some attention.
3569100	3574100	The Gayer Gamer was a gamertag that got banned recently.
3574100	3582100	Also, this gamertag got banned. Richard Gaywood was a gamertag that got banned, and you might be thinking, ho ho ho, Gaywood.
3582100	3585100	There's actually a street near here. It's Gaywood Street.
3585100	3586100	Dick Gaywood.
3586100	3590100	Here's the thing. His name is really Richard Gaywood.
3590100	3591100	His parents apparently hate him.
3591100	3595100	There's actually a scan of, no, that's the last name. You don't get to pick your last name.
3595100	3599100	There's actually a scan of his driver's license up on the internet. His name was Richard Gaywood.
3599100	3607100	Now, why you would want to use your name as your gamertag is beyond me, but granted, did Xbox overreact?
3607100	3611100	Some gay themed websites chimed in on this.
3611100	3618100	Lesbian Gamer said, I've taken a few deep breaths, run this story over in my mind again and again, and yet still return to the same annoying factor.
3618100	3625100	Why does gay automatically equate to sex or of a sexual nature and carry with it such negative and deviant overtones?
3625100	3634100	I can understand Microsoft is trying to protect users, but perhaps there needs to be some table debate as to what they're protecting whom from and what they're perpetuating in the process.
3634100	3638100	Linking gay to some negative or sexually explicit content merely fans the fires of homophobia.
3638100	3648100	Gay Gamer said this, I'm somewhat on the fence with the issue, having played many MMORPGs and seeing the many annoying and disturbing names that can come from the idle minds on the internets.
3648100	3652100	And it seems as if Microsoft is putting up the normal, we can't make exceptions defense.
3652100	3660100	All of this, however, is greatly outweighed by the fact that it is given name, and despite the connotations it may carry with it, he lives with that name every day.
3660100	3666100	And I'm sure you've probably been wondering what I, the gay host of Orange Laund Radio, have to say on this subject.
3666100	3674100	And honestly, you want my honest opinion on this subject? We have much bigger things to worry about in life than this.
3674100	3683100	For instance, they are going to try and overturn the recent gay marriage thing that was passed in the state of California by the Supreme Court.
3683100	3687100	Finally have allowed gay marriage to happen in the state in less than 30 days.
3687100	3690100	And the crazies are going to try and put it on the November ballot.
3690100	3696100	And according to recent polls, 54% of Californians would vote for it to overturn gay marriage.
3696100	3702100	Because, yeah, suddenly you're going to let gays marry and there's going to be like this just sudden fuckwave going through the state.
3702100	3706100	And everybody's going to start fucking everywhere because that's what happens when you let gays get married.
3706100	3709100	Next thing you know, cats marry dogs and up is down.
3709100	3714100	Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria. Stupid.
3714100	3720100	So, you know what I have to say? The hell with Xbox Live. It's their service. They can do whatever they want.
3720100	3723100	I mean, yeah, it's a little asinine, but whatever.
3723100	3725100	Rob, I have a question.
3725100	3727100	We have more important things to worry about right now.
3727100	3728100	Yes?
3728100	3733100	If gay marriage is allowed, wouldn't that like lower the amount of gay sex that's happening?
3733100	3736100	You know, because once you get married you stop having sex.
3736100	3737100	Yeah, it really would.
3737100	3738100	She has a point.
3738100	3743100	So, you know, that would be good for the, you know, the right wing if, you know, gay marriage was allowed.
3743100	3745100	Welcome to the Olive Garden Roundtable.
3745100	3752100	That and there would be a lot more economic growth for all of the gay men registering.
3752100	3759100	I loved what Ellen said. I'm sorry to get political on this show, but for obvious reasons this is something I feel very, very strongly in.
3759100	3761100	It won't be the last time I say something about it. It's a deal.
3761100	3762100	Okay.
3762100	3764100	Do you see any of this protesting?
3764100	3765100	No, I know. I know.
3765100	3770100	But I love what Ellen said to John McCain is that she said something about, she compared it to, and it's really like this,
3770100	3776100	is that you say there's two chairs over there and you can sit in one but you can't sit in the other.
3776100	3779100	Why not? You just can't.
3779100	3781100	That's what it feels like. Think about it.
3781100	3783100	All right.
3783100	3787100	That's it. I am against chair marriage as well.
3787100	3789100	That's just wrong.
3789100	3791100	What will you do without you?
3791100	3799100	I honestly, I think that the best, one of the best, and I'm sure a lot of people know by now I'm a big fan of the show Bullshit.
3799100	3804100	Watch the episode about gay marriage and polyamory. Seriously.
3804100	3809100	Thank God for the youth of America because I seriously think I'm probably preaching to the choir, most people of this show.
3809100	3813100	I mean I know we have tons and tons of heterosexual people that listen to this show that probably listen to this and go,
3813100	3816100	what's the big freaking deal?
3816100	3820100	That's what we're saying. That's all we're saying. What's the big freaking deal?
3820100	3823100	Because people have the religious corn cob up their ass.
3823100	3826100	That's a lot less comfortable than other things to be up their ass for.
3826100	3831100	I'll tell you what, there's a million other things we're going to hell for before gay marriage, I'll tell you that.
3831100	3833100	Anyhow, moving on.
3833100	3834100	People are stupid.
3834100	3836100	Please get me off my political tangent.
3836100	3839100	I'll take the soapbox out from under you.
3839100	3846100	Well how about we speak of our common nemesis that we have with the rest of the video game community.
3846100	3850100	Now everyone can agree, no matter what, everyone can agree.
3850100	3852100	He who shall not be named.
3852100	3854100	That this guy's a moron.
3854100	3858100	I'm going to say his name so that I can read this headline, which is wonderful.
3858100	3865100	Jack Thompson, guilty man, 27 of 31 misconduct charges recommended by judge.
3865100	3869100	There's a lovely picture under this on the distorted article.
3869100	3870100	He said his name.
3870100	3875100	This is karma, you dump it, you drink it.
3875100	3876100	Lovely.
3876100	3887100	Yeah, so basically dude is on, dude's guilty for fucking up.
3887100	3890100	Did Jack Thompson jump up and go, objection.
3890100	3891100	No, because he's not that.
3891100	3893100	Overruled, bitch.
3893100	3899100	I, the day that he is completely, what's the word, disbarred.
3899100	3905100	I am going to, what's something awesome.
3905100	3910100	Dude, when Jack Thompson is disbarred, I might dress up as Tingle.
3910100	3913100	Do it.
3913100	3914100	Shit.
3914100	3915100	He just said he might.
3915100	3919100	No, they're having the results of the disbarring trial on June 4th.
3919100	3923100	So it is, you know, like, I didn't say I would, I said I might.
3923100	3924100	Yes, you did.
3924100	3925100	You said you would.
3925100	3926100	I said I might.
3926100	3927100	No takes.
3927100	3928100	It says might.
3928100	3931100	What did this June 4th fall on?
3931100	3933100	We will be live on Wednesday.
3933100	3935100	No, I'm kidding.
3935100	3936100	If they let us.
3936100	3937100	We will record live.
3937100	3939100	Where would I get a Tingle outfit?
3939100	3941100	Where would I even get that?
3941100	3942100	We will make.
3942100	3943100	Okay.
3943100	3945100	You know what?
3945100	3946100	What?
3946100	3948100	You'll bring back Dr. Dick.
3948100	3949100	We'll see.
3949100	3950100	And, or Mr. Spanky.
3950100	3956100	There will be celebration of some sort happening when, when Lord Voldemort is disbarred.
3956100	3962100	I think that's, and on top of that, we need to send a letter to Ice Cube.
3962100	3963100	Wiki this, please.
3963100	3964100	Why?
3964100	3965100	No, it wasn't Ice Cube.
3965100	3966100	It was Ice T.
3966100	3967100	Why?
3967100	3972100	Because, um, Fuckhead got him back in the, um, nineties for his album.
3972100	3973100	Remember?
3973100	3974100	Oh, yes.
3974100	3975100	Because his big thing was music.
3975100	3977100	And then he moved from music to video games.
3977100	3982100	All this guy wants is to have the world lick his ass, not kiss it, lick it.
3982100	3984100	Licking is far more disgusting.
3984100	3986100	All right.
3986100	3989100	We're going to be opening up the Skypline very soon.
3989100	3991100	Let's pay Politary to do that.
3991100	3994100	Well, it sounds just like you're singing.
3994100	3996100	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3996100	4003100	But first, one more story that's not about Lord Voldemort or Tingle dressing.
4003100	4004100	Yes.
4004100	4006100	And this is not a bad story, actually.
4006100	4012100	Um, there's going to be some Japanese songs that may be hitting rock band very soon, actually.
4012100	4022100	Um, apparently, um, a harmonics developer, uh, told Joystick during a rock band's party in New York City,
4022100	4027100	um, that they will be seeing some Japanese rock music in the games.
4027100	4033100	Um, apparently they were supposed to be, there should be an announcement coming soon, but who knows?
4033100	4037100	Maybe, uh, some stuff like TM Revolution, uh, Malice Miser.
4037100	4039100	What would you like to see?
4039100	4040100	The Pillows?
4040100	4041100	Guitar Wolf.
4041100	4042100	Malice Miser's so old.
4042100	4043100	What's her name?
4043100	4044100	The crazy chick.
4044100	4045100	Kana?
4045100	4046100	Kana?
4046100	4047100	Yeah.
4047100	4048100	I don't know that she's doing anything anymore.
4048100	4049100	That's too bad.
4049100	4050100	Kana's crazy, though.
4050100	4051100	Guitar Wolf.
4051100	4052100	They need Guitar Wolf.
4052100	4053100	Bees.
4053100	4054100	But...
4054100	4055100	But Bass Wolf is dead.
4055100	4056100	Did they replace...?
4056100	4057100	Gacked.
4057100	4058100	Gacked.
4058100	4059100	Maybe.
4059100	4060100	Bees.
4060100	4061100	Definitely.
4061100	4062100	There you go.
4062100	4063100	Here...
4063100	4064100	Yeah, they'd probably have Smop or something.
4064100	4065100	Listen.
4065100	4066100	This is what Activision needs to do, okay?
4066100	4068100	If you want to make an actual game that's going to be something that stands out from
4068100	4071980	all these other music games out there, you make the official Guitar Wolf game.
4071980	4075100	You have it be an action game with music playing in there as well.
4075100	4076100	Zombies.
4076100	4077100	With zombies.
4077100	4079100	And you fight zombies with your, uh, awesome guitar skills.
4079100	4080100	Ooh!
4080100	4081100	This is a good game here.
4081100	4084100	So you would fight zombies with your guitar and you're a Japanese rock star.
4084100	4086660	It'd probably, though, have, um, like, um...
4086660	4088740	That's almost like Revolution X, but cooler.
4088740	4090020	So I don't really...
4090020	4091020	Dream games make it so.
4091020	4092020	No, I don't know.
4092020	4093020	No, we already had a dream game tonight.
4093020	4097860	There's a few, um, I guess more, I would say obscure rock bands that I wouldn't mind hearing
4097860	4098860	there.
4098860	4099860	Like O'Miele's, uh...
4099860	4101420	They're going to have, uh, Brutal Legend.
4101420	4103660	That one with Jack Blackday is going to be, uh, Roadie.
4103660	4107380	They fight, you know, zombies and, like, all sorts of, like, uh, bumping chicken.
4107380	4109380	I still have your copy of Wild Zero.
4109380	4111680	I was wondering where that was.
4111680	4112680	It's in my house.
4112680	4113680	Oh, okay.
4113680	4115680	All right, we're going to open up the Skypline.
4115680	4118020	1-8-7-7 GAMEOLR.
4118020	4120380	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4120380	4123900	We only have time for a couple calls tonight, so we're going to try to keep this short and
4123900	4124900	keep the calls short, too.
4124900	4125900	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
4125900	4126900	Who's this?
4126900	4127900	Hey, hey, hey.
4127900	4131140	It's now level 30 DJ Rama S. It's not Zaku.
4131140	4133900	Why level 30 Rama S?
4133900	4138260	I just surveyed my big level 30 this past weekend, and I am sober.
4138260	4139260	Congrats.
4139260	4140260	Whoa.
4140260	4144260	Oh, you're having the same birthday that I'm having next month.
4144260	4146420	Oh, yeah.
4146420	4148380	Well, congrats to you.
4148380	4149500	Congrats on your ding, man.
4149500	4150500	Thank you.
4150500	4152740	What else is on your mind besides that you're old?
4152740	4155340	Um, I finally got my Xbox 360.
4155340	4159060	Ooh, what'd you think?
4159060	4162060	I kind of wish I'd gotten it sooner, but I'm pretty happy with it, and I have to thank
4162060	4165380	Loki because he's been randy about Saints Row and Crackdown.
4165380	4166660	I actually picked them up.
4166660	4167660	Nice.
4167660	4169340	They're like dirt cheap now, so.
4169340	4172100	Yeah, and I'm enjoying it.
4172100	4174260	Crackdown is really, Crackdown is a great game.
4174260	4177700	What made you finally, what finally broke you into getting an Xbox 360?
4177700	4181060	What was it that finally made you go, yes, I need this?
4181060	4186980	Because we already have a Wii in the house, and what's left is the PS3 and the Xbox 360.
4186980	4191580	And there's one thing that the Xbox 360 has that the PS3 does not.
4191580	4193020	Which is?
4193020	4196100	Games that I'd actually play.
4196100	4199460	There you have it.
4199460	4203300	So what other games did you get besides the two that Loki had recommended?
4203300	4205820	Finally we went out and got Rock Band.
4205820	4207580	Of course, nice.
4207580	4210740	I picked up a copy of Rumble Roses XX.
4210740	4212220	Nice.
4212220	4214900	And we have Bioshock, oh my god, that game is awesome.
4214900	4215900	It is very awesome.
4215900	4218100	Do you have an HDTV to play all this on?
4218100	4219100	32 inch.
4219100	4220100	Very sexy.
4220100	4221820	Oh yeah.
4221820	4222820	Very sexy.
4222820	4225180	So we'll have to jam on Rock Band sometime, add me to your friends list.
4225180	4227180	I think I have room, I may not, I don't know.
4227180	4232340	I hope so, because I will go check it, and I did download Yaris while y'all was on break.
4232340	4234220	Wow, what'd you think?
4234220	4236340	I haven't played it yet, but this is the way I look at it.
4236340	4237660	Free game is free.
4237660	4240500	Free game is free, but free game is also a bit of a waste of time.
4240500	4241500	What are you laughing at?
4241500	4242500	I'm sorry.
4242500	4245700	DarkSocker is being very distracting tonight, because she's laughing at something.
4245700	4251020	She's showing us this YouTube video of a flying penis.
4251020	4253380	I saw that, that was funny.
4253380	4255700	Remember the penis age in Second Life?
4255700	4256700	This is real life.
4256700	4261300	That is so stupid, and you guys are like, laughing.
4261300	4262300	How old are you?
4262300	4263300	How old are you?
4263300	4264300	Five?
4264300	4265300	Six?
4265300	4266300	It has to do with gaming.
4266300	4267300	Alright, anyhow.
4267300	4269940	Is it a chess champion speech?
4269940	4273060	I thought it was, yeah, they had that on Best Week Ever.
4273060	4275060	I'm sorry, Rama, for that.
4275060	4278780	Is there anything else you wanted to share besides the flying penis copter, as Act-Def
4278780	4279780	calls it?
4279780	4280780	No comment.
4280780	4281780	Alright, take care, Rama.
4281780	4282780	Alright, bye.
4282780	4283780	Alright, bye.
4283780	4284780	Bye.
4284780	4290340	Stop distracting the show with your flying penises.
4290340	4292940	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?
4292940	4293940	But it's clock.
4293940	4294940	It's GS68.
4294940	4296940	GS68, what is on your mind, my friend?
4296940	4298940	Do you have a flying penis?
4298940	4301940	Are you a fan of me right now?
4301940	4302940	Yep.
4302940	4306100	Wait, hey, you gotta get some noise.
4306100	4308940	Are you in the middle of a crowd or something?
4308940	4314220	Actually, no, I'm in the main area.
4314220	4315220	You're in the main area?
4315220	4317180	Are there tons of people walking through there?
4317180	4320660	Over by the hall with the meeting rooms.
4320660	4323900	Dude, make a beeline to the vendor hall and make some noise for Orange Lawn's radio.
4323900	4325900	Yeah, you gotta make some noise for Orange Lawn's radio.
4325900	4326900	Alright, that's alright.
4326900	4328100	What, what, how's it going this year?
4328100	4329100	That was fun to me.
4329100	4330100	What are we missing out on?
4330100	4331100	Let's see.
4331100	4343340	This is the gaming room and dealer's room, for better or for worse, and dealer's room,
4343340	4348140	they have maximum two and three, for example, but it's $1.50 a game instead of $1.
4348140	4358340	They have the, pretty much the same Bamaari from last year, they still, they have Pops
4358340	4362260	and there's going to be Fever, but they made it Adam L2 instead, which is awesome.
4362260	4366220	Have there been any, any awesome panels this year to make up for the loss of Orange Lawn's
4366220	4367220	radio?
4367220	4375500	There's Bonzi Arcade, which is basically a game show where, also before, where you have
4375500	4381260	like video game children, sometimes you're challenged to like, do a third test in a video
4381260	4386340	game, like collect 25 rings and fight the hedgehog or beat the final boss of Sonic 2.
4386340	4387340	Huh.
4387340	4388340	Interesting.
4388340	4392660	It sounds like you're having fun.
4392660	4396980	What are some of the craziest cosplays you've seen while you've been there?
4396980	4406420	Let me see, let me think, um, there, there's one mecha cosplay, I forgot the name, but
4406420	4410980	he has some lights on his, I would say that was pretty cool.
4410980	4411980	Hmm.
4411980	4412980	Sounds good.
4412980	4417180	I went to the hand-tack room for the heck of it.
4417180	4422860	It was hilarious, like, like, like you're doing, I was doing like hand-tack and stuff
4422860	4431260	like that, and people were like, and the freaking stuff they were showing.
4431260	4432260	Huh.
4432260	4435380	Well it sounds like you're having fun and you're going to continue to throughout the
4435380	4440420	rest of the weekend, so I'm sorry we didn't make it this year, but are there any OLR listeners
4440420	4442420	that you've run into?
4442420	4446860	Unfortunately, I appear to be the only one that I know of.
4446860	4447940	Aw, sadness.
4447940	4450220	Some of the staff listens to our show, I know they do.
4450220	4451220	Yeah.
4451220	4452220	They're all closet fans.
4452220	4453220	Yeah.
4453220	4463100	So, so on my DS, like, I sent my nickname to O-R-M-E-G-S-68, I went into the world with
4463100	4469620	use Mingle Mode and just walked around to that way, so people pass my DS, so when other
4469620	4475220	people in Mingle Mode pass by my DS, they'll see my name and, yeah.
4475220	4478620	I like the grassroots effort to get the OLR name out there.
4478620	4479620	Very well done.
4479620	4480620	Yeah.
4480620	4487620	I had a little OLR circle flash logo, right?
4487620	4488620	Yeah?
4488620	4495500	Yeah, I think first thing I had it in my badge holder, because I had an oversized badge holder,
4495500	4499420	like it's big enough to carry a little card under my badge.
4499420	4500740	Oh, very cool.
4500740	4505300	We should make, we should make little somethings for people that go to anime conventions.
4505300	4508140	Ooh, I should look into that, like little stickers or something that people can wear.
4508140	4512860	I thought I could check out the anime master last night, I didn't really like it.
4512860	4519300	Like, a lot of, like a lot of kids, they try too hard with the voice acting, so it's a
4519300	4524800	sounding cheated horror wonder to really dance kit, like, too many people doing that freaking
4524800	4527300	Haru Haru Yagai dance, I mean...
4527300	4528300	It's still good.
4528300	4531300	I suppose.
4531300	4537920	But they're pretty awesome more versus Capcom skit, where they, where they were the...
4537920	4544460	I think Ryou's Shinkou had broken a character, like they replicated that with like a, well,
4544460	4546860	a cellophane, which was pretty awesome.
4546860	4551060	It looked like a laser, I guess.
4551060	4552060	Huh.
4552060	4555820	Well, it sounds like you're having a real good time at Fonome, so keep spreading the
4555820	4560420	word and let us know, expect a full, full report next week.
4560420	4565280	Also, we want to let you know, a good friend of OLR, Mel, he is apparently, Mel B is apparently
4565280	4569260	deejaying something on Sunday at 10 o'clock, so I don't know how long you're going to be
4569260	4570260	there.
4570260	4571260	Excuse me?
4571260	4573580	Apparently Mel B is deejaying something tonight, in an hour, at 10 o'clock.
4573580	4574580	He's deejaying something.
4574580	4576900	There must be some type of dance or something going on.
4576900	4577900	Me too.
4577900	4579900	Mel B, our buddy.
4579900	4582980	Oh, Mel B, um, I don't really know him.
4582980	4584780	Oh, well tell, he knows OLR.
4584780	4585780	Oh, I see.
4585780	4586780	All right.
4586780	4589180	We gotta let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but have fun.
4589180	4590180	All right, bye.
4590180	4591180	Run around, act crazy.
4591180	4592180	All right, see you around.
4592180	4593180	All right.
4593180	4594180	Take care.
4594180	4595180	See you around.
4595180	4596180	Thank you.
4596180	4597180	Thanks, buddy.

4782680	4783960	course and again crap but

4814780	4817380	the line right that's still pretty cool
4817380	4820620	all my gosh is like an entire album
4820620	4824100	of stuff yeah there's some of our videos to one of them is
4824100	4827180	me like with my orange hair and i'm doing like part of the har har yukai

4830940	4832080	uh...
4832080	4835660	one of them are supposed to be each ago but i think it's a full outfit so i'm
4835660	4837900	just exposed to have a school uniform
4837900	4839260	uh...
4839260	4843060	that another one of the next my friend who he was coupling tension and i'm
4843060	4844060	supposed to be a
4844060	4847400	killing from the melancholy of her he says to me
4847400	4852060	i'm trying to figure out if this is you
4852060	4855140	we're trying to look at the pictures here oh yeah that looks like orange here
4855140	4857660	that's probably right there
4857660	4858660	very cool
4858660	4863340	though sounds like you have always are just like tons and tons of people there
4863340	4865180	or yeah i think that like that
4865180	4868320	fourth biggest convention in the united states or something like that that is an
4868320	4871580	awesome pyramid head out there with that
4871580	4874540	let's get here and a cosplay out of here with us in my head to the pictures
4874540	4875580	earlier uh...
4875580	4876620	very hot
4876620	4879480	uh... so i think what at what do you really did things to see their real
4879480	4881600	quick
4881600	4885260	uh... well i don't really get the play much because there is like huge lines
4885260	4886980	for all the games
4886980	4889980	but me of course with a huge station with all you play classic fighters like
4889980	4891740	street fighter and just like
4891740	4895000	goes on and on and then there's like brawl of course
4895000	4896340	uh...
4896340	4897960	correct your case that they had like
4897960	4899160	beat mania
4899160	4900540	six-part and
4900540	4901760	and then they have
4901760	4903000	the new one
4903000	4905620	gold
4905620	4907220	and i really get to play that because
4907220	4910260	i was wrong with the six max fishing i put in my quarters and they like ripped me off
4910260	4913440	i was just like dang it
4913440	4916660	they had an in the group two machine
4916660	4920080	i think it had r twenty one or something because
4920080	4923540	it had this whole opening preview video that over four thousand five hundred
4923540	4927540	songs i'm just like holy shit and somebody probably installed
4927540	4930000	a hack on it
4930000	4937000	something but oh my god it was huge and then they had ddr extreme pump it up
