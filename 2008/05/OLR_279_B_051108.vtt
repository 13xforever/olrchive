Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast on May 11, 2008.

00:06.140 --> 00:12.480
It's Mother's Day, so if you forgot, you definitely owe your mother like a big bouquet of flowers.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.560
So you should definitely call her if you haven't already, or, you know, whatever motherly figure

00:17.560 --> 00:20.880
is in your life because, you know, some single parents and so on.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.800
Not everybody necessarily has a mom, but call somebody and tell them you love them.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
Damn it.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
Love is in the air.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.000
Myself, DarkSakuraLoki here with you on Orange Lounge Radio part B. We're about to get back

00:29.000 --> 00:33.080
to some news, but first, we have some business to take care of.

00:33.080 --> 00:39.640
We have to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest,

00:39.640 --> 00:46.320
which we're working with AllGames.com to give away a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite Grand

00:46.320 --> 00:48.440
Theft Auto IV system.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.560
It's only like one of eight that have been made, and we have picked our finalists tonight

00:52.560 --> 00:57.320
that will compete against all of the other finalists from all the other all-game shows,

00:57.320 --> 01:01.440
such as, you know, Video Game Outsiders and All Games Interactive and Bobby Black Wolf

01:01.440 --> 01:02.440
and so on.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.000
They have all picked their finalists, and they will all do battle for that console.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.720
But just for qualifying, they've won a $25 gift certificate to the all-game store and

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
a t-shirt.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.560
So enough suspense.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.600
Let's play the winner for you guys one more time, the winner of the Grand Theft Auto IV

01:19.600 --> 01:23.640
contest on Orange Lounge Radio SSJ 100, Matt.

01:23.640 --> 01:29.000
From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes

01:29.000 --> 01:35.120
Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
That's right.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.800
The highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMania

01:40.800 --> 01:45.560
is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing new songs danced

01:45.560 --> 01:46.560
in.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.840
You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite

01:50.840 --> 02:11.520
Orange Lounge Radio hosts, like Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, please note there are no real

02:11.520 --> 02:14.960
songs sung by Dark Sakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lounge Revolution

02:14.960 --> 02:18.280
team being physically castrated, dying in a bow fire on an ocean of piss while being

02:18.280 --> 02:20.960
incinerated by an underwater volcano, sorry.

02:20.960 --> 02:39.280
You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan, John D. M. N. Bressler, and a ton of licensed

02:39.280 --> 02:44.200
music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't want you to hear.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.400
The gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer and you might

02:48.400 --> 02:49.560
as well just offer torrents on the website.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.040
So come and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.880
When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplayed.com.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.680
It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied

03:01.680 --> 03:07.720
head while on top of a couple, having sex, shouting, fuck, but I pooped from there, and

03:07.720 --> 03:09.880
it's only from the Nintendo Wii.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.040
So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a work or breach,

03:14.040 --> 03:17.840
bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.000
If you do, Loki might dress up as Tingle.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.880
Not a guarantee.

03:22.880 --> 03:28.240
See, he says at the end there, not guaranteed, Loki, that you will in fact dress up as Tingle.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.960
It's still implying, though, that it was sales of...

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
Yeah.

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
All right, so there it is.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.200
Congrats, SSJ100, Matt, but a big round of applause, everybody, please, to our finalists.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.600
They were all very good, and everybody that participated, we couldn't play them all in

03:41.600 --> 03:42.600
the final round.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.600
I get two claps.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
That's all you got for your mouth.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.600
All right.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.600
Thank you.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.600
Now, here's the thing, though.

03:47.600 --> 03:52.040
Now we have to all throw our support behind SSJ100, Matt, as he moves into the final round,

03:52.040 --> 03:55.880
because I'll tell you what, because it's a bunch of OLR in-jokes, you know when they

03:55.880 --> 03:59.200
play that on All Games Interactive or however they decide to do the final, there's a lot

03:59.200 --> 04:03.080
of people that are going to listen to that and go, what the hell is that?

04:03.080 --> 04:04.720
Like, I don't get it.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.200
So we all have to support SSJ100, Matt, now by making sure in the final voting phase,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.620
we all go and vote for him, because we want him to win.

04:11.620 --> 04:17.860
We want to say that the winner came from OLR, so be sure to throw your support behind him

04:17.860 --> 04:18.860
in the finalist round.

04:18.860 --> 04:22.820
We'll give you more information on that next week when the voting should be up.

04:22.820 --> 04:26.480
So check for that on our website as well a little later this week.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.480
All right.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.920
So congrats, SSJ100, Matt.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.660
Another giveaway to come later in the show, that res code finally going to be given away

04:32.660 --> 04:37.880
to somebody, thank God, in a new game coming up a little bit later.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.160
But first, more news.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.080
Loki, let's go back to some gaming news.

04:41.080 --> 04:47.440
I don't want to watch the stock market too much, but I guess if you were hoping that

04:47.440 --> 04:53.440
Tari was going to make a big turnaround and become this really profitable company, well,

04:53.440 --> 04:54.440
no.

04:54.440 --> 05:01.400
In fact, Nasdaq has actually delisted them from the stock exchange, because they have

05:01.400 --> 05:08.240
failed to, well, basically, they failed to submit the year-end financials, and, you know,

05:08.240 --> 05:11.440
before that, the market value was way too low.

05:11.440 --> 05:17.520
They have been dropped, dropped like an American Idol contestant who just couldn't make it.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.840
Or an American Idol contestant's father from backstage.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.080
Did you read about that?

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Yes, I did.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
Funny stuff.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
Oh, wait.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.080
Do we have more in the saga of one of the Davids?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
I forget.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.400
I'm not letting this show turn into American Idol chat.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
Not, not, not.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.600
Yes, apparently someone's abusive daddy, you know, a la Michael Jackson.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
Shut up!

05:35.600 --> 05:44.720
Apparently, there's a certain booboo, if you remember last week, with kind of doing, there's

05:44.720 --> 05:50.480
a cover of a song that he did that, you know, had the lyrics, beautiful girls in it.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.480
That caused him a lot of money.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.480
I hate you guys.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.080
And besides, that was cheap anyways.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.520
That was as cheap as that one chick who was saying all the, like, American Jesus theme

06:00.520 --> 06:01.520
songs.

06:01.520 --> 06:07.680
Anyways, so yes, Atari got delisted from Nasdaq, and, um, yeah.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.960
They're just going down a slippery slope.

06:10.960 --> 06:16.560
Hopefully someone will buy them, and it will be, you know, a little bit more than all Dragon

06:16.560 --> 06:19.960
Ball Z Atari remake games.

06:19.960 --> 06:26.800
Well, we reached out to Atari for comment, and this is all they had to say.

06:26.800 --> 06:33.280
Bad joke.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.280
Nobody's gonna get it.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.280
Alright.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
Chirp, chirp.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.280
Take a shot.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.120
Let's go on to some more.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.960
Please tell me somebody got it.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
I got it.

06:41.960 --> 06:42.960
Alright.

06:42.960 --> 06:43.960
It just wasn't funny.

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
Alright.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.960
No, I got it, but, you know, isn't that an Amco game?

06:46.960 --> 06:47.960
No!

06:47.960 --> 06:50.200
It was on the Atari 2016, forget it.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.680
It was on the 2600, but it's an Amco game.

06:52.680 --> 06:57.360
Atari licensed it for the 2600 and then shit all over it, if you remember.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.280
Alright, forget it.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.400
Little Big Planet.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.480
Let's talk about, like, new and exciting games as opposed to games that were out, like, twenty

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
years ago.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.600
Uh, Little Big Planet will be coming out in October.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.140
This was announced at the PlayStation Day 2008 event in London.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.520
It's from Kazurai himself.

07:14.520 --> 07:20.260
He has confirmed that Little Big Planet's gonna be making its way in October, but one

07:20.260 --> 07:25.960
thing you should be aware of is that, uh, the open beta, not happening.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.440
So if you were looking forward to the public beta that was, like, promised several times

07:29.440 --> 07:31.680
for the game, uh, nope.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.840
The public beta's going away.

07:32.840 --> 07:33.840
So surprised.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.840
You know, a promise broken by Sony, gee.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.880
Hopefully there'll be a demo or something, but don't hold your breath.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.880
You'll probably just have to wait for the game to come out.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.360
Let me just add another check mark on the board there.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.920
Uh, yeah.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
Alright.

07:47.920 --> 07:52.480
But Little Big Planet will be making its way in October, um, unless it gets delayed again.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.480
Who never knows.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.480
Who knows?

07:54.480 --> 07:55.920
It'll be all sorts of awesome whenever it comes out.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Alright.

07:56.920 --> 07:57.920
So, moving on.

07:57.920 --> 08:04.720
Well, for things that are to be, uh, coming out, as, uh, mentioned is, uh, Home, which

08:04.720 --> 08:10.680
has been pushed back, pushed back, turned around, upside down, set on fire, and dropped

08:10.680 --> 08:17.720
in, said Underwater Volcano, um, is going to be getting a fall release, which is, uh,

08:17.720 --> 08:23.560
been told to us by SCEED President, uh, David Reeves, and said, he's quoted as saying maybe

08:23.560 --> 08:28.000
we were too ambitious with the non-gaming applications within Home, getting sponsors

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
and stuff like that.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
But don't worry.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.380
You know, in the meantime, Sony has your back.

08:32.380 --> 08:35.680
There is another social engineering game that they have out right now.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.280
It's gonna have a pretty large community.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.640
It's called Go Outside.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.160
But no, it's centralized around large cities.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.760
However, it's not quite as prestigious as, say, Home.

08:45.760 --> 08:51.020
The game is actually homeless, and, um, you can find yourself participating in wonderful

08:51.020 --> 08:58.040
activities like sleeping on a park bench, um, spewing out obscenities, um, talking to

08:58.040 --> 09:03.200
a wall, and, um, just not being cared for.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.720
Okay.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.020
I need to do a quick poll in chat right now.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.020
Quick poll in chat.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.200
All right.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.900
Which joke was funnier?

09:11.900 --> 09:18.160
Loki's homeless joke or Rob's Atari joke?

09:18.160 --> 09:21.080
Place vote now in chat.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.080
In the main chat room.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.080
I think, you know what's funnier?

09:23.080 --> 09:24.080
Which joke was funnier?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
You know what's funnier?

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
Tonight's show.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.080
Tonight's show is hilarious.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
Hilarious!

09:31.080 --> 09:32.080
All right.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.080
Loki, go to the next story.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
Please.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
Oh, wait, wait.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.300
Oh, hold on.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.300
We have the quick poll.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.300
Results are in.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.800
Uh, Rob's Atari joke.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Rob's joke.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
Atari.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.800
Rob.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Rob.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.800
Rob's Atari joke.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.800
Rob's.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.800
Rob's Atari joke.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.800
Because Rob used the Atari Pac-Man dying sound.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.800
Rob.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.800
Rob's Atari joke.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
Rob.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
Rob.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.800
Look at that.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.800
I rock.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.800
Whatever.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
Love you, Loki.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.800
Um, so this is a big surprise.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.600
There's rumors now that Daxter and Wipeout Pulse are going to be ported to the PS2.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.600
Really?

10:02.600 --> 10:04.360
PSP games to be imported to the PS2?

10:04.360 --> 10:05.360
That's a first.

10:05.360 --> 10:12.360
So, and this is coming from Juke's Video France, and they were just stating that, of course,

10:12.360 --> 10:13.840
those two games are being ported to the PS2.

10:13.840 --> 10:19.920
I would say that's a pretty safe guess, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it, so.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.400
Not a big surprise.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.960
All right.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.280
So now we've got to downgrade our games to get them to sell more.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.280
Is that basically what this is?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.680
Well, here's the thing, here's the thing, too, is when they port them over, they don't

10:29.680 --> 10:31.560
enhance, like, any of the graphics or anything.

10:31.560 --> 10:37.880
In fact, I believe Ratchet and Clank's size matters didn't look that good on the PS2.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.680
Twisted Metal, pretty cool.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.160
Silent Hill Origins, pretty cool.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.640
But just, I don't know.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.000
Least they could do is, like, upgrade the graphics a little bit.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.240
Yeah, or put them on PS3.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.600
Upgrade, go all the way to PS3.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
Why not?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.200
Yeah, who knows.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.320
Oh, we had another comment in the quick poll.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.000
Uh, I would have voted for Loki if he would dress up as Tingle.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.500
Sorry, don't care.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.040
That was from Black Wolf, by the way.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.240
I don't need his sink and vote.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.680
Or his friendship on the PlayStation Network.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.440
Are you going to unfriend Bobby Black Wolf?

11:10.440 --> 11:13.080
Well, that would involve me turning on my PlayStation 3.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.200
That would be a controversy right there.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.640
All right.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.800
Just kidding.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.800
Bobby's awesome.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.240
Here's another game we can try to beat Bobby at in the future.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.360
Bizarre Creations.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.280
They are making a new racing game.

11:24.280 --> 11:28.400
You might remember, they are no longer really involved with Project Gotham Racing.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.760
Microsoft now owns the IP to that, and will be, I guess, developing the inevitable Project

11:32.760 --> 11:34.040
Gotham Racing 5.

11:34.040 --> 11:39.360
Bizarre Creations is making a new franchise that will be, I guess, published by Activision,

11:39.360 --> 11:42.320
and it's coming out in the 2010 fiscal year.

11:42.320 --> 11:47.600
Now that could mean, like, holiday season 09, because the 2010 fiscal year starts April

11:47.600 --> 11:49.480
1st of 2009.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.320
The quote from the conference call earlier this week, Bizarre is deep in development

11:53.320 --> 11:58.120
on two multi-platform titles, and we are looking forward to the release of our first new racing

11:58.120 --> 12:02.440
IP in fiscal 2010, which already looks very strong.

12:02.440 --> 12:07.920
And I just hope, like, I don't know, the thing about Project Gotham for me is that it's a

12:07.920 --> 12:12.200
little heavy on the car shop, you know, and tuning your car and stuff, and I just want

12:12.200 --> 12:15.360
to play, like, a really easy pick-up-and-race type game like F-Zero.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.080
I think that's why I like F-Zero and Mario Kart.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
They're really easy.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.160
I want it easy and fast.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.960
That's why I like F-Zero, because you get to drive so fast.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.760
Like I seriously still say F-Zero GX is one of my favorite racing games ever.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.520
This is great.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
So.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.760
We'll see, though, what Bizarre has in store for us, because, you know, they might just

12:35.760 --> 12:42.720
try something completely new out of left field that's going to make me go, da-da-da-da, want.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.600
Might you say that, Dark Sakura?

12:44.600 --> 12:45.600
Da-da-da-want.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
Ooh.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.600
We'll see.

12:48.600 --> 12:54.520
Well, speaking of stuff that came through via conference call.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.520
How's that for tie-in?

12:55.520 --> 13:05.800
It was actually stated by Activision Publishing CEO Mike Griffith that Guitar Hero has surpassed

13:05.800 --> 13:09.960
15 million in individual song downloads.

13:09.960 --> 13:16.120
So I guess Rock Band's got a little bit more to catch up with, but then again, Guitar Hero

13:16.120 --> 13:21.360
has been out longer, so.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.760
In shorter time, Harmonix hit 10 million.

13:25.760 --> 13:32.760
So I think that, look at it in perspective of time and then see who's doing better.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.760
That's what I say.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.800
I sense a little bit of favoritism on your part.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.880
Especially since Rock Band already had to deal with Guitar Hero's...

13:39.880 --> 13:40.880
Whoa!

13:40.880 --> 13:41.880
Sorry about that.

13:41.880 --> 13:42.880
Okay.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.880
I'm setting up for something later.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.360
Don't pay attention to that.

13:45.360 --> 13:51.520
But since Guitar Hero was already out and already had a loyal fan base when Rock Band

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
came out.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.900
So to hit 10 million after all that, I think Rock Band's got...

13:55.900 --> 13:59.760
And I'm looking at this just by terms of numbers and time, that I think Rock Band's the more

13:59.760 --> 14:00.760
impressive.

14:00.760 --> 14:01.760
Hmm.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.840
Well, you know, I don't know.

14:04.840 --> 14:09.320
Guitar Hero, I still like it because I think it's more fun to play guitar on Guitar Hero

14:09.320 --> 14:10.320
than it is on Rock Band.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.120
But Rock Band's definitely the better party game.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.920
I like hitting things.

14:13.920 --> 14:14.920
Fuck that shit.

14:14.920 --> 14:15.920
Guitar Freaks.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.920
I don't know who you guys...

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
No.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.920
Guitar Freaks is kind of...

14:18.920 --> 14:19.920
No!

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
Guitar Freaks!

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
No.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
Sorry.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
Where's your loyalty?

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
No loyalty.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
Sorry.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.920
I defected.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.920
Hey, I still love Beatmania 2DX.

14:27.920 --> 14:28.920
I will always have a soft...

14:28.920 --> 14:29.920
And Keyboardmania.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.440
And Keyboardmania, I will always have a soft, squishy spot in my heart for Keyboardmania.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.960
By the way, completely unrelated, and Loki, once you mentioned it, I had to look it up,

14:35.960 --> 14:43.200
and I think that's the most hilarious thing I've ever heard for the American Idol thing.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
You know what?

14:44.200 --> 14:45.960
I'm not derailing this show with your Idol chat.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.160
Hey, it's only a few more weeks, and then it's over.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
I'm the...

14:49.160 --> 14:50.160
Thank God.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
Oh my God.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.160
I don't believe this.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.160
I'm the reality TV whore of you three.

14:53.160 --> 14:57.160
I am hosting a freaking survivor game on LiveJournal right now.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.600
That's what a whore I am for reality TV.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
And it's you two that do reality...

15:01.600 --> 15:05.760
Dude, I explained the other night this isn't reality TV.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.840
It's a talent contest.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.840
There's a difference.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.880
It's not a bunch of people acting like retards.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.080
You don't see anything into their personal life on the show.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.400
I like people acting like retards.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.400
She doesn't have a point.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.400
It is a contest.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400
It is a contest.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.360
You're not looking at how these people are living in their daily lives.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.360
And thank God for that.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.320
They just interview them.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.520
You're not following them as they're trying to build a hut out of coconut leaves and duct tape.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.200
Wouldn't it be more fun if the Idols did have to build...

15:30.200 --> 15:31.200
No.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.200
No.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
No.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.200
No.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200
No.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
No.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.200
No.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.200
Because, you see, this is why I don't watch any of the results show, and I just read the

15:38.200 --> 15:43.160
news about watching tons of Ford commercials being their little musical numbers.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.480
I actually have not watched a physical episode on TV this year.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.280
All I have to say is I'm missing the Survivor Micronesia finale tonight to be here, and

15:51.280 --> 15:56.240
if you spoil it in chat, I will punch you in the face, and it will hurt.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.240
You've got TiVo.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
I know.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.240
But still.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.560
You have TiVo.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.760
I have YouTube on my phone at work.

16:02.760 --> 16:03.760
All right.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.040
We do have gaming news at some point during the show tonight, yes?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.040
Yes.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.040
Yes.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.000
So this is kind of an interesting thing.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.320
I guess it's got some interesting bullet points to it.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.400
Guitar Hero On Tour, of course, coming out in June.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.240
Well, there's rumors now that they are...

16:21.240 --> 16:27.080
Activision is partnering with Nintendo to release Nintendo DS bundles that will include

16:27.080 --> 16:29.880
the DS system as well as Guitar Hero On Tour.

16:29.880 --> 16:36.560
It will be the first third-party kind of combo pack that they've done with the DS so far.

16:36.560 --> 16:43.440
So that's kind of neat, whoring the game out a bit, yes, I guess.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.440
I don't know.

16:44.440 --> 16:49.760
I would say that you would need the black and red or crimson black DS so to fully look

16:49.760 --> 16:53.720
pretty cool with this, but I don't know.

16:53.720 --> 16:57.360
It's neat, I guess.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
I think...

16:58.360 --> 16:59.360
I was going to say.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.360
I think that they're doing...

17:01.360 --> 17:06.680
I think Guitar Hero 4 is coming out in DS2, so you're not going to have to worry about

17:06.680 --> 17:09.240
playing on tour for a long time.

17:09.240 --> 17:14.480
Are they really going to move that many DS units with this one game?

17:14.480 --> 17:17.680
I think it's going to sell pretty well.

17:17.680 --> 17:21.120
It's innovative, I guess.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.120
It's innovative, I guess.

17:24.120 --> 17:27.280
It's an interesting peripheral, let me put it that way.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.280
You know what?

17:28.280 --> 17:29.280
What?

17:29.280 --> 17:35.000
I don't know if it's an original idea at all, because the Wonderswan had the BeatMania wheel.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Scratch table.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.720
But this is different, this is much different.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.440
There's been games that's had add-ons of a similar nature.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.600
I'm not saying that add-ons...

17:45.600 --> 17:50.200
I think it's an interesting add-on, because I know when I'm thinking Guitar Hero for the

17:50.200 --> 17:54.040
DS before they ever showed off this guitar grip thing.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.600
I'm thinking you tap in the screen to be the music type thing.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.360
So this is definitely a lot better than that.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.360
I don't know.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.640
It'd be interesting to see what they do with it.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.080
Definitely not going to do a PSP version, because that'd be weird.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.280
I don't know how the hell they would do that.

18:09.280 --> 18:15.000
All right, well, more Guitar Hero news.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.320
That is that apparently Guitar Hero is supposed to be taking a big leap.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.160
This is again from that same conference call earlier this week from Activision.

18:23.160 --> 18:28.120
It was the CEO of publishing, Mike Griffith, said, for the holiday we will provide a significant

18:28.120 --> 18:32.840
leap forward in innovation for Guitar Hero worldwide on all platforms.

18:32.840 --> 18:39.960
Meaning the PS3, the PS2, 360, DS, Wii, more information coming in the coming weeks.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.360
Notice how there was no confirmation about the multi-instrument rumor going around about

18:43.360 --> 18:46.120
Guitar Hero 4, but is that really innovation?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
If they just...

18:47.120 --> 18:51.120
Well, it's innovation in their eyes, because they haven't done it before, therefore it's

18:51.120 --> 18:53.040
a first for them.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.240
I don't know.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.120
Something tells me there will be some type of instrument we haven't thought of yet that's

18:57.120 --> 18:58.120
going to be in it somehow.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.520
I mean, come on, Rob.

18:59.520 --> 19:03.820
Look at the Wii, okay, and the Wii Wheel when they made that announcement.

19:03.820 --> 19:08.720
That was a big step in innovation to them, despite the fact that there had been third

19:08.720 --> 19:11.600
party games that had done that since the Wii launch.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.400
So it's retarded.

19:13.400 --> 19:18.560
They just pat themselves on the back and stuff, fluff themselves, I don't know what.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.560
But it's just, it's retarded.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.160
Nice.

19:23.160 --> 19:32.120
So, yeah, so Guitar Hero 4, we'll see, we'll get more news on it later, I guess, and I'm

19:32.120 --> 19:37.880
sure we'll be shocked and awed, but not really, because we already kind of figured it out.

19:37.880 --> 19:38.880
Are we shocked and awed?

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
Nope.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.880
Are we just going awed?

19:41.880 --> 19:42.880
Maybe.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.240
Well, guess what else should be getting some downloadable content?

19:46.240 --> 19:47.240
What?

19:47.240 --> 19:48.240
Well, sort of.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.680
Samba de Amigo on Wii.

19:51.680 --> 19:55.000
Wait, wait, you mean downloadable content on the Wii?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
How is this possible?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Explain yourself.

19:58.000 --> 20:06.960
There is, they were taking a look at the cover for Samba de Amigo, and at the top is Wii's

20:06.960 --> 20:09.680
Pay to Play logo.

20:09.680 --> 20:15.000
So it could be indicative of some downloadable content.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Pay to Play?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.240
Yeah, that was something that was announced back at Game Developers Conference.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.240
Really?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.360
Tell me more about it, because I forget.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.240
It's a little orange thing that looks like the Wi-Fi logo, but it's, you know, orange

20:25.240 --> 20:28.600
that says Pay to Play on it, and basically going to indicate that there's going to be

20:28.600 --> 20:31.140
downloadable content for the game.

20:31.140 --> 20:35.920
I hope it's not, oh, look, Samba de Amigo, you have to pay a quarter every time you play

20:35.920 --> 20:36.920
this game, you know, that goes...

20:36.920 --> 20:37.920
You know...

20:37.920 --> 20:38.920
I doubt it.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
You know what I want instead of online play?

20:40.920 --> 20:41.920
Maracas?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.680
Where are my maracas?

20:43.680 --> 20:47.120
I'm sure some third-party company will put out cheap plastic maracas for your...

20:47.120 --> 20:48.120
Maraca attachments?

20:48.120 --> 20:49.120
Yeah.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
Why not?

20:50.120 --> 20:51.800
I want my maracas, and I want to pose.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.280
Damn it, I'm just going to bust out the new cast.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.960
I'm sure the posing will be there.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.960
I want maracas!

20:55.960 --> 20:57.360
We could develop our own maraca attachment.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.360
Here's the thing, though.

20:58.360 --> 21:04.780
I bet you anything, because the space on the Wii is so limited, I bet you anything it is

21:04.780 --> 21:08.920
not pay to download content, it's pay to unlock content.

21:08.920 --> 21:09.920
Because why not?

21:09.920 --> 21:14.100
We're already on the 360 with games like Katamari, and we need to stop referring to these things

21:14.100 --> 21:16.040
as downloadable content and call them what they are.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.160
You are paying to unlock something already on the disc.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.080
You know, though, I don't know if that might be the case, because, I mean, this stuff could

21:21.080 --> 21:23.480
be, like, MP3 format or something very similar.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.320
You're not actually making the music to the game, it's just going along with it.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.320
Perhaps you could...

21:28.320 --> 21:30.640
The Dreamcast ones were actually downloadable.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.200
And did you actually download the whole songs?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.200
Yes, I did.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
Wow.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
But I thought you just got the little...

21:35.200 --> 21:36.200
You stored them on your VMU.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
Huh.

21:37.200 --> 21:41.760
And they could maybe allow downloading content to, like, an external device, like your SD

21:41.760 --> 21:42.760
memory card.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.160
I also had Samba 2000, remember?

21:46.160 --> 21:49.460
Oh yeah, I always forgot Samba de Amigo actually had a sequel.

21:49.460 --> 21:53.000
Remember when we would do the New Year's parties at my house that you would actually show up

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
for?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Oh yeah.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.760
And we would bust out Samba de Amigo at least three years in a row?

21:56.760 --> 21:57.760
Good times.

21:57.760 --> 21:58.760
I love Samba de Amigo.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.320
Because it was all about playing the Burning Rangers theme.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.320
I almost want to get the Wii one, just for retro sake.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.320
I'm going to get the Wii one.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.320
I mean, it has Take On Me.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.320
At least the old one did.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.040
I don't know if the new one does.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.780
We'll see.

22:10.780 --> 22:11.780
We will see.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.200
And what, Burning Rangers?

22:13.200 --> 22:18.760
Well, while we're waiting for actual download content on the Wii, whether, I guess, Samba

22:18.760 --> 22:23.080
de Amigo is going to be the first one or not, in the meantime, though, in July, we are going

22:23.080 --> 22:29.120
to be getting something not quite downloadable, but expanding on with Rock Band Track Pack

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
Volume 1.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.720
It's coming to the PlayStation 2 and the Wii.

22:32.720 --> 22:38.120
What's kind of neat about this game, actually, it's not really adding on to the game.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.640
I mean, it's almost like its own game.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.240
It has its own songs.

22:42.240 --> 22:49.600
They've got a list of about, I want to say there's, looks like, 10, 15 tracks there.

22:49.600 --> 22:56.000
And all stuff that's currently available on Xbox Live or Kitten PlayStation Network, like

22:56.000 --> 23:02.840
30 Seconds to Mars, The Kill, Blink-182, all the small things, Kiss, Calling Dr. Love,

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
and so on.

23:03.840 --> 23:11.040
And so if you actually, if you don't own Rock Band, you can just buy this for like $29.99,

23:11.040 --> 23:12.040
if you want.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.280
I guess it will contain 20 songs.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.280
Wait, so even if you don't own normal Rock Band, you can still buy this disc?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
Yes.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.240
So it's not like an append disc where you have to have the normal game?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.240
No.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.240
You can actually just play it by itself.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.240
Interesting.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.880
I don't know why people would do that.

23:24.880 --> 23:29.960
I don't know why either, but I mean like if you own a PlayStation 3, say for example,

23:29.960 --> 23:36.080
and you know, you happen to have one that does still play PlayStation 2 discs, you can

23:36.080 --> 23:40.680
use the PlayStation 3 guitars, because they're the same as the PlayStation 2 guitars, to

23:40.680 --> 23:41.800
play this game.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.800
Or drums.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.800
So.

23:43.800 --> 23:44.800
Interesting.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.800
Yeah.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.800
Alright, well.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.800
Or you could just pay to download the songs.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.800
I mean, you could just do that.

23:48.800 --> 23:54.400
Well, you know, or if you own a PlayStation 2 and a Wii, or a Wii I guess, you don't really

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
have the option.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.400
Thank you, Nintendo.

23:57.400 --> 24:01.920
Well, there's some more Rock Band news that's kind of interesting this week, and it has

24:01.920 --> 24:06.680
to do with more Rock Band tracks, but this time it's free tracks, and we like free, but

24:06.680 --> 24:10.120
it's kind of the way that you get them, which is very interesting.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.920
The band Disturbed apparently is going to be having some tracks in Rock Band, and the

24:13.920 --> 24:17.920
only way you get this is by pre-ordering their latest CD, which I think is Indestructible?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.440
Is that what it's called?

24:19.440 --> 24:24.080
You pre-order this CD, and then you actually can get the songs that apparently will not

24:24.080 --> 24:26.400
be going public until June.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.560
I guess it'll go on the public download service then.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.040
You can get these songs.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.360
So kind of an interesting band tie in there.

24:32.360 --> 24:37.960
Also, South Park season 11, which kind of ironic if you ask me, because South Park season

24:37.960 --> 24:43.160
11 is the one that has the episode that spoofs Guitar Hero, and you even see the picture

24:43.160 --> 24:49.660
on the cover of the season 11 DVDs is that it has Stan and Kyle from that episode playing

24:49.660 --> 24:50.660
Guitar Hero.

24:50.660 --> 24:56.560
What's interesting is apparently if you buy that DVD set, you get three Rock Band tracks

24:56.560 --> 25:01.200
with it, and it's not the first time South Park would have tied into Rock Band, because

25:01.200 --> 25:03.960
think Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld is one of the unlocked songs in the game,

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
which is pretty awesome.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.280
I hope it's actual South Park songs.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.840
I hope they're South Park songs, too.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.320
Like DVDA, Now You're a Man.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.520
Or Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucker.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.960
I love some of the stuff from the movie.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.220
That would be great.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.220
Or what was this song?

25:16.220 --> 25:18.220
Little Boy, You're Going to Hell.

25:18.220 --> 25:19.220
Remember that?

25:19.220 --> 25:20.920
It also has a good guitar riff in it.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.920
That'd be great.

25:22.920 --> 25:23.920
We'll see.

25:23.920 --> 25:24.920
All right.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.000
In the meantime, we're going to take a little trip to our mailbag.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.200
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura rips

25:32.200 --> 25:36.480
open the email bag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you guys,

25:36.480 --> 25:40.720
and unfortunately, though, it's Slim Pickens in the mailbag this week.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.600
Sounds like not a lot of folks emailed us.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.480
Dark Sakura's going to pick her two favorite emails tonight to read for you right now,

25:46.480 --> 25:50.920
but if you want to email us for a future week, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

25:50.920 --> 25:51.920
Dark Sakura, take it away.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.660
Well, I did get a couple from Rob with Two Bs, but I'm actually still reading over them,

25:55.660 --> 25:59.200
so I'll have to save them for next week.

25:59.200 --> 26:06.700
First one comes from Katamari's Forever, a good Sunday to you, O-L-R. That's so pleasant.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.740
I'd like to start my letter regarding what I wrote last week.

26:09.740 --> 26:14.440
Having copied down what Act Deaf said on Part B two weeks ago, I tried removing Photo Channel,

26:14.440 --> 26:19.640
but since I didn't download it in the first place, it wasn't there to delete.

26:19.640 --> 26:24.040
I would also like to state that since the show reaches 1 a.m. in Michigan, I usually

26:24.040 --> 26:27.880
go live during Part A and go to sleep during the beginning of Part B. I can't thank you

26:27.880 --> 26:31.640
enough for providing a podcast through your RSS feed so that I can listen later.

26:31.640 --> 26:39.120
Now, I would like to address a popular issue that I've seen recently in games, their ratings.

26:39.120 --> 26:44.480
It seems that every new release title gets to be a number one on aggregate sites like

26:44.480 --> 26:48.440
Gamer Kings, only to fall down to the top 30 a week later.

26:48.440 --> 26:55.080
Do exclusive reviews usually skew opinions, hence the 100% that a PS3 version of Grand

26:55.080 --> 26:57.120
Theft Auto IV is getting?

26:57.120 --> 27:02.280
I mean, sure, the first reviews usually spew out love, but it's usually the first people

27:02.280 --> 27:04.680
who influence the next, right?

27:04.680 --> 27:10.880
If so, for example, GameSpot gave a game like Okami for Wii a 9.0 when the other reviewers

27:10.880 --> 27:11.880
follow suit.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.680
I guess it's just buzz.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.680
Which brings me to my other point.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.440
Where's Bioshock?

27:17.440 --> 27:23.360
In a mere amount of months, the 2007 game of the year just vanished out of thin air.

27:23.360 --> 27:29.400
Nowadays, I don't hear a peep about this legendary game anymore, but just to whoop to and braw

27:29.400 --> 27:34.240
and testimonials about GTA IV, seriously, I've got a friend who calls this game quote

27:34.240 --> 27:37.280
the truth.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.920
Are gamers really that ADD?

27:39.920 --> 27:40.920
Yes.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.920
Yes.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.640
Two random things I want to address.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.640
Why does Rob hate Toadette?

27:46.640 --> 27:51.000
She's just the same as Toad, and Mario Kart Wii is very nice, but bikes seem unusable

27:51.000 --> 27:53.120
when playing with the Wii wheel.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.200
Okay, here's the thing about Toadette and why I don't like her is, A, Toad's voice,

27:57.200 --> 28:00.440
I love Toad, but his voice is kind of annoying, I'll admit.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.040
I like Toad circa Super Mario 2.

28:03.040 --> 28:07.400
Toadette takes that voice and makes it 20 times even more like fingernails on chalkboard.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.520
But here's the other thing about Nintendo that I kind of don't like the little pattern

28:10.520 --> 28:17.880
they developed where it was like Mario and Wario, Luigi and Waluigi, Donkey Kong and

28:17.880 --> 28:18.880
Diddy Kong.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.000
Everybody has this freaking relative, right?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.720
So by the time Toad and Toadette came around, I was like, okay, enough.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.000
Waluigi's funny because his name's sort of a pun.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.760
And so I take out all my hatred on Toadette.

28:28.760 --> 28:32.400
Well, they need Peach and her slutty cousin Cherry.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.400
Here's Daisy.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.120
Ah, who gives a shit about Daisy?

28:35.120 --> 28:37.120
Are you thinking of that episode of Drawn Together?

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
I don't know.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
Never mind.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
Never mind.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
Can I continue?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
You may.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.840
Sorry about the long letter, I'll be sure to talk about something else next time.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.280
Katamari's forever.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.480
Change is inevitable, except at the Olive Garden where endless soup, salad, and breadsticks

28:50.480 --> 28:55.040
are $9.95 every day, excluding Australia LOL.

28:55.040 --> 28:58.480
I love how all of our emails now have to end their email with some type of Home of the

28:58.480 --> 29:00.600
Never Ending or Olive Garden reference.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
Love it.

29:01.600 --> 29:06.600
Hey Sky, Dark Sakura, and Loki, thank you for playing my entry for the contest on the

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
show.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.360
And I'm glad you guys liked it and said it was great, that really means a lot to me.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.760
It's a shame that few people are entering to win, but I guess that most people listening

29:15.760 --> 29:18.400
already own an Xbox 360 or PS3.

29:18.400 --> 29:22.160
I'm curious to hear the other entries for the contest though, so keep us informed.

29:22.160 --> 29:28.160
Oh yeah, I've got a story for you guys about how I got to know your podcast.

29:28.160 --> 29:33.840
I was actually looking for podcasts with lounge music, so I typed lounge podcast and something

29:33.840 --> 29:36.760
like that into Google and it led me to your website.

29:36.760 --> 29:40.560
I downloaded an episode and the beginning was like Sky's famous intro beginning with

29:40.560 --> 29:43.920
video games, video gaming, and gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.880
Being a gamer myself, I thought, hey, I'll check this out, and I actually laughed my

29:47.880 --> 29:49.640
ass off.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.440
And I was immediately hooked, mouthpiece.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.760
So there you have it, a somewhat unusual way of getting to know you guys, but the name

29:55.760 --> 29:59.520
Orange Lounge Radio really paid off.

29:59.520 --> 30:03.840
Which is funny because a lot of times I think we haven't been discovered because our title

30:03.840 --> 30:07.640
does not have game in it, and people are like, what does Orange Lounge have to do with video

30:07.640 --> 30:08.640
games?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.320
So it's just kind of funny that the reverse worked.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.320
It's ditter.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.320
That's great.

30:12.320 --> 30:16.880
By the way, Sky, you do sound like Lowslow from GTA a lot, smile face, but that's not

30:16.880 --> 30:18.560
a bad thing because he's so funny.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.560
Oh, okay then.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.760
I forgive you.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.720
Keep up the great show, lots of love from Belgium, Martin.

30:23.720 --> 30:29.160
Okay, now DarkSakura, it occurred to me you weren't here last week, so you didn't hear

30:29.160 --> 30:31.720
his entry, but the problem was he was ineligible because-

30:31.720 --> 30:32.720
I did hear it.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.720
You did?

30:33.720 --> 30:34.720
I played it the week before.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.720
Oh.

30:35.720 --> 30:36.720
This was the really funny-

30:36.720 --> 30:37.720
Oh, you know what it was?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.480
I didn't play it on air that time you heard it.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.480
Yeah.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.480
Okay, then you've heard it.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.480
All right.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
Yeah.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.480
But we played it on air last week, right?

30:44.480 --> 30:45.480
Yeah.

30:45.480 --> 30:46.480
All right.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.480
Yeah.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.480
That's what I thought, and you weren't here last week, so.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.480
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.480
What?

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
We have one more.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.480
Okay.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.480
Better be short.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.480
It is.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.480
It's really short.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
All right.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.480
It's from GS68.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
All right.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
Hey, OLR crew.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
I've got seven words for Black Wolf.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.760
What do you have against the ferret?

31:01.760 --> 31:03.160
What is the ferret?

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
I don't know.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.160
We'll have to ask.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.160
Where's my baby?

31:06.160 --> 31:07.160
Where's my baby?

31:07.160 --> 31:08.160
I hit him last week when you weren't here.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
You butt.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.160
No, I don't know.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.160
I actually don't know.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.160
I seriously don't know where the ferret is.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.160
It's somewhere around here.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.160
He's hiding from Bobby.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.160
Hopefully I threw him away.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.160
No.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.160
No, I'm just kidding.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.160
He's hiding from Bobby.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.160
I think it's-

31:19.160 --> 31:20.160
You traumatized the baby ferret.

31:20.160 --> 31:26.480
I think there's a little bit of a rivalry between our mascot, the ferret, and Bobby,

31:26.480 --> 31:29.800
and I'm not sure who it belongs to, Bobby or Super Happy Fun Time Show, but Clicky the

31:29.800 --> 31:30.800
Pen.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.800
I think there's some type of rivalry there.

31:31.800 --> 31:32.800
Clicky the Pen.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.800
Yes.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.240
But the ferret has cuteness.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.240
That's true.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.240
But the pen goes click.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.640
But the pens are also useful.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.640
All right.

31:41.640 --> 31:42.640
Anyhow.

31:42.640 --> 31:46.480
Ferrets are useful too because you can throw them at your co-host.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.760
If you can find it.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
All right.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
Hey.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.760
Watch.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
I'll find another ferret.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.400
All right.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.720
That's it for the email this week.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.960
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you have some emails you would like to contribute.

31:59.960 --> 32:07.020
But we've got some more gaming news, and then we are minutes away from a brand new OLR game.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.680
You don't even know what it is yet.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.120
I think it's going to be fun.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
I'm excited.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.960
Or it will suck and we'll never play it again.

32:12.960 --> 32:13.960
That's what happens to games.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.160
They're either really good or they suck and we never play them again.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.160
All right.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.960
So let's go over to Loki for another story.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.200
All right.

32:23.200 --> 32:29.240
So this isn't a big surprise because they were talking that Bazaar was going to be working

32:29.240 --> 32:31.840
on a new Bond game.

32:31.840 --> 32:38.880
Well, may not be Bazaar, but apparently Treyarch is working on a new Bond game and it's going

32:38.880 --> 32:45.500
to be Bond Quantum of Solace, which is going to be released the third quarter of this year

32:45.500 --> 32:46.960
along with the movie.

32:46.960 --> 32:51.520
It will be running on the Call of Duty 4 engine, which, I mean, hey, if they're going to pick

32:51.520 --> 32:57.160
a first person shooter engine to run it on, that's probably the best one to pick.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.600
So that should be pretty awesome.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.400
Maybe another GoldenEye, you know, because the multiplayer in Call of Duty 4 is pretty

33:01.400 --> 33:02.400
awesome.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.240
So we'll have to see.

33:04.240 --> 33:10.800
But the film is being released in the UK on October 31st, November 7th in North America.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.680
Does that mean that we'll actually get the game then?

33:14.680 --> 33:16.000
Or do you think we'll have to wait for the DVD?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.520
I think it will come out fourth.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.980
Why does it say third quarter?

33:18.980 --> 33:19.980
It's fourth quarter.

33:19.980 --> 33:24.680
I guess third quarter financial quarter, I guess, for them.

33:24.680 --> 33:25.960
But yeah, fourth quarter.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.920
So that would make sense.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.320
All right.

33:29.320 --> 33:33.460
Well, other fours in the industry this week, Doom 4.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.460
That's right.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.600
Doom 4 was announced this week.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.540
It's been a few years since we've had an entry in the Doom franchise.

33:39.540 --> 33:44.820
There was Doom 3 a few years ago, like I remember that was on the Xbox One, but Doom 4 is on

33:44.820 --> 33:46.160
its way.

33:46.160 --> 33:51.280
And CEO Todd Hollensheet said this week in a press release, quote, Doom is part of the

33:51.280 --> 33:56.320
ID software DNA and demands the greatest talent and brightest minds in the industry to bring

33:56.320 --> 34:00.360
the next installment of our flagship franchise to Earth.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.280
There are no other details given at this time.

34:02.280 --> 34:07.240
Speculation is that ID's Tech 5 engine will be used.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.240
And who knows?

34:08.240 --> 34:11.040
And story-wise, who knows where this game could go.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.140
But then again, if the movie didn't kill the franchise, then, you know, it could go anywhere.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.140
So Doom 4.

34:16.140 --> 34:17.440
Are you excited about Doom 4?

34:17.440 --> 34:18.440
No.

34:18.440 --> 34:22.600
I thought Doom 3 looked really awesome, but I don't know, it didn't have the charm of

34:22.600 --> 34:23.880
Doom 1 and Doom 2 for me.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.080
I never really liked Doom.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.680
Are you playing Doom for the charm?

34:26.680 --> 34:27.680
Yes, for the charm.

34:27.680 --> 34:30.700
I like Doom 1 and 2 for the mods, but that's about it.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.600
I didn't really care for the games.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.720
I didn't even really get in the Quake either.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.920
Duke Nukem 3D, that was my game.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.200
You know what I liked about Doom?

34:38.200 --> 34:43.360
I just, you know, I don't know, Wolfenstein, that was a good game.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.480
Just Doom didn't do it for me.

34:44.480 --> 34:50.880
I think mainly Doom didn't do it for me because at the time my PC couldn't run it.

34:50.880 --> 34:55.200
Only had one meg of RAM, so, you know, it was a little tough to run that game.

34:55.200 --> 34:59.400
Your friend and mine, Bobby Black Wolf in chat, says ID makes great engines.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.520
They don't make great games.

35:01.520 --> 35:07.720
I liked the first Doom because, first of all, it had a difficulty level called Hurt Me Plenty.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.520
And, secondly, the Wolfenstein levels.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.520
Alright.

35:11.520 --> 35:16.120
It's all about IDDQD and IDBFG.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.840
Don't forget Hexen and how frickin' awesome that game is.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.840
Hexen was great because of the NRA code.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.200
All weapons.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.200
Hi.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.200
Alright, we are gonna...

35:24.200 --> 35:26.200
In god mode with Satan.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.200
Awesome.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.960
Alright, we are gonna go to the Skype line.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.720
In fact, if you heard a little background noise, it's because we already picked it up,

35:32.720 --> 35:36.040
where we have two people sitting on the Skype line right now, if I'm not mistaken.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.800
Toshin, you are there, correct?

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
Yes, I am.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.800
Hi, Toshin.

35:39.800 --> 35:40.800
How are you?

35:40.800 --> 35:41.800
I'm good.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.800
Alright.

35:42.800 --> 35:43.800
And FootyMonster, you're there too, right?

35:43.800 --> 35:44.800
Yep, I am here.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.080
How are you doing, FootyMonster?

35:47.080 --> 35:48.080
Doing very well, actually.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.080
Thank you.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.080
Alright.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.080
Now, we've got a little bit of a score to settle in.

35:51.080 --> 35:55.720
I don't even know how this came about, but it turned out that we have this res code we've

35:55.720 --> 36:00.840
been trying to give away for, like, I don't know, like two months, and somehow we found

36:00.840 --> 36:02.520
out that you two didn't have it.

36:02.520 --> 36:06.320
And which is so funny, because tonight, like, everybody's been PMing me, like, I wanna play,

36:06.320 --> 36:07.640
I wanna play, because I want the code.

36:07.640 --> 36:11.600
But no, no, we said a couple weeks ago it was gonna be Toshin versus Footy, but we originally

36:11.600 --> 36:15.300
said we were gonna play the match game, but I hate to break it to you guys, we thought

36:15.300 --> 36:16.660
of something new.

36:16.660 --> 36:20.360
So we're gonna subject you to a new game tonight, because we can do that, it's our show.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.760
I am very scared about this.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.760
You should be.

36:22.760 --> 36:23.760
Are you scared, Toshin?

36:23.760 --> 36:24.760
Yes.

36:24.760 --> 36:25.760
Alright.

36:25.760 --> 36:30.600
Well, let's unveil the game that Toshin and Footy will be playing tonight for the Res

36:30.600 --> 36:33.480
HD code.

36:33.480 --> 36:38.560
That's right.

36:38.560 --> 36:45.480
It's the OLR Family Feud will be what Toshin and Footy are playing tonight.

36:45.480 --> 36:49.320
Alright, here's the deal.

36:49.320 --> 36:55.480
We have surveyed several OLR personalities in different video gaming categories, the

36:55.480 --> 37:00.120
OLR family, if you will, and you two will be competing against each other head to head

37:00.120 --> 37:01.560
to see who can earn more points.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.680
Here's how you earn more points.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.900
You're gonna pick a number one through four that will be the board that you play when

37:06.900 --> 37:08.360
it's your turn.

37:08.360 --> 37:13.160
And on the board are the top answers in a particular video gaming category, like let's

37:13.160 --> 37:15.480
say best game ever.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.160
And you can take turns at the board to see what the hosts and our friends would have

37:19.160 --> 37:21.640
said was the best game ever.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.440
If you don't guess correctly, you guess something that's not on the board, you get a strike.

37:25.440 --> 37:30.160
Three strikes, and it will go to the other player who will get one chance to steal the

37:30.160 --> 37:32.800
board and all of your points.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.200
So you definitely don't want to have your board stolen.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.280
So it sounds good.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.600
Are you familiar with the show Toshin?

37:39.600 --> 37:40.600
Yes I am.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.160
Alright, are you familiar with the show, Footy?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.200
I have no idea what you just said.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.200
Alright.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.200
Well then you're in trouble my friend.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.080
Alright, well here's the thing.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.180
We'll have Toshin go first then.

37:51.180 --> 37:56.080
So that way, Footy, hopefully you can figure out what's going on quickly, alright?

37:56.080 --> 37:58.000
Okay, basically it comes down to what?

37:58.000 --> 38:03.600
I have to say a name of a person that would have said what is the best game to them.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.600
Not a person, not a person.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.920
Let's say the category was best video game ever made.

38:07.920 --> 38:12.120
Like since you know that I answered it, you would probably guess that Super Metroid is

38:12.120 --> 38:13.280
somewhere on the board.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.520
And then you'd hear ding.

38:14.520 --> 38:19.200
But if you guessed, you know, a game that none of us, like if you guessed Crysis, then

38:19.200 --> 38:22.600
you'd hear ehhh, because none of us would have picked that, you know, because we're

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
not Sakura Max.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.600
So, okay.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.080
So you're going to be telling us whose names are on the board?

38:27.080 --> 38:28.080
Yes.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.080
And then I have to guess a name?

38:29.080 --> 38:30.080
Or, okay.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.080
Yes, I'm going to, no you don't have to guess a name, you just have to guess the answers

38:32.080 --> 38:33.080
that are on the board.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.080
This is getting complicated.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.080
Alright.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.080
Alright.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.080
That's alright.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.080
Okay.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.080
Alright, here is the OLR family that have contributed to tonight's answers.

38:39.080 --> 38:44.400
Myself, Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, Loki has contributed to the board tonight, Bobby Blackwolf

38:44.400 --> 38:50.560
contributed to the board tonight, Miklatov contributed to the board tonight, RicePrincess

38:50.560 --> 38:53.200
and DMN all have contributed answers to the board.

38:53.200 --> 38:59.480
So there are seven possible answers, but sometimes answers are worth more because multiple people

38:59.480 --> 39:00.480
said them.

39:00.480 --> 39:04.000
Like, for instance, if it had been best game ever, Chrono Trigger probably would have been

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
worth like three points.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
So, does that make sense?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Yeah.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Alright.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Here we go.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.560
Oh, we have to do it just like they do on the show.

39:12.560 --> 39:16.360
Let's play The Feud.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.100
I said, let's play The Feud.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.100
Where's the damn music?

39:19.100 --> 39:20.160
There we go.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.160
Let's play the feud.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.160
Alright, alright.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
Stop music.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.160
Alright, here we go.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.080
Toshin, since you know what you're doing, we're gonna have you go first.

39:26.080 --> 39:30.040
So, Toshin, do you want board number one, board number two, board number three or board

39:30.040 --> 39:31.040
number four?

39:31.040 --> 39:32.040
Three.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.040
All right.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.040
Board number three.

54:42.200 --> 54:46.440
You just send me a message asking for my email. So I'm guessing we're in the works. Wonderful

54:46.440 --> 54:49.360
All right, have a good one. All right toshin. I'll be in touch with you. All right. Bye. Bye

54:50.000 --> 54:51.400
Yeah

54:51.400 --> 54:56.560
All right. No, so did you guys like the game? It went on for like 20 minutes, but it was cool

54:56.560 --> 54:58.960
It's sort of fun a little different. All right

54:59.560 --> 55:01.560
Let's see. I

55:01.560 --> 55:05.920
I like the concept but it's a horrible game. You can't you can't get anyone's answers

55:05.920 --> 55:09.200
The group is being the group being surveyed is way too difficult to predict

55:09.400 --> 55:12.200
It's funny to hear their answers, but near impossible to get guess them

55:12.800 --> 55:17.280
Hmm like that's any better than like the match game. We'll see. Well, yeah, I know

55:17.600 --> 55:22.160
Well, we'll try it. We'll try a version. Maybe we'll survey the entire chat room before the show

55:22.160 --> 55:25.400
We'll see but then but then the chatters know what's coming. That's the problem

55:25.400 --> 55:28.500
That's why we didn't do it that way this time because then they know what questions are coming now

55:28.500 --> 55:34.440
I just see you so this is fine the way it was. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see they can quit their bitching. All right

55:36.160 --> 55:39.460
All right, well, uh, we'll see what happens with that in the future in the meantime

55:39.560 --> 55:41.280
We've got to go back to some more news

55:41.280 --> 55:44.400
We got more gaming news just a little bit and then we're gonna open the skype line

55:44.760 --> 55:49.440
For you guys to give us a call with your own thoughts on fire. Yes, and then we'll set the skype line on fire

55:49.440 --> 55:57.680
Go. All right any excuse for me to play the pac-man noise again. We will be welcomed. All right, next story, please ninja guide in to

55:58.400 --> 56:00.520
If you pre-order it you get stuff

56:01.680 --> 56:02.920
the end

56:02.920 --> 56:06.040
What kind of stuff the first 39,000 people to?

56:06.760 --> 56:09.120
pre-order their copy and pick it up from a

56:09.960 --> 56:11.960
selected retailers

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
Are going to get a set of armor in the game that?

56:16.000 --> 56:20.400
Let's you look like the bad guys that you're facing it's a

56:21.720 --> 56:24.840
basically a nice big costume for you, so

56:25.800 --> 56:32.660
However, if you are of the more patient variety, you can download a costume pack of three

56:33.200 --> 56:34.080
in

56:34.080 --> 56:37.280
July which will be 200 Microsoft points

56:38.240 --> 56:42.600
It's going to have Ninja guidance who will be out in Europe on the 6th of June

56:42.600 --> 56:45.920
So you can test out how fun it is then

56:47.760 --> 56:49.640
All right

56:49.640 --> 56:52.060
Yay, yay indeed stuff

56:52.680 --> 56:54.120
All right. I like stuff

56:54.120 --> 56:59.480
I just don't like having to pre-order games because then a better deal will come out of the game the day the game comes out

56:59.920 --> 57:01.640
Yeah

57:01.640 --> 57:05.640
Well, there's gonna be hopefully some interesting news coming very soon

57:06.480 --> 57:07.400
apparently

57:07.400 --> 57:12.800
Microsoft is having a PR event next week where they're going to

57:13.480 --> 57:21.280
Supposedly debut the new Xbox 360 motion controller, and of course we talked about last week their partnership with gyration

57:22.760 --> 57:28.360
Also the other things that they're going to be unveiling and I know this is probably going to happen is banjo-kazooie 3

57:28.720 --> 57:32.160
In fact there's been some screenshots. I've already come out for that so

57:32.160 --> 57:40.480
It's going to be interesting to see what goes on, and this is during the game critics awards, I guess

57:41.360 --> 57:43.760
That's supposed to happen next week, so I

57:45.600 --> 57:51.120
Don't know we'll see all right. You know what actually um a good idea came to us

57:51.120 --> 57:55.640
I'm going to get can I read this aloud for the family Feud. I I guess so sure

57:55.640 --> 58:02.440
I think this is a good idea is that we could survey the chat room for family Feud and have people in studio play like

58:02.440 --> 58:07.420
When we have some of our guests here like we could get like rice princess and mo to battle each other we could get

58:08.200 --> 58:13.300
Nathan and next offer or something like get some guests on the show to battle each other that might be kind of fun

58:14.080 --> 58:19.040
That might be a little bit access to the chat room exactly that that then it would be a secret

58:19.040 --> 58:25.160
I like that idea we have to make them face like us. We'll see a panel in this chat room feud at that point

58:25.160 --> 58:28.940
Maybe that's what we'll rename it to the chat room feud all right anyhow. Sorry

58:28.940 --> 58:34.120
I didn't mean to derail from the topic of the games. Yes, you did. Yeah, I did a little bit, but I mean

58:35.160 --> 58:39.600
How much of a we ripoff is this going to be if at all or do you think they are going a totally different?

58:39.600 --> 58:41.920
Direction with this if true it depends what they do with it

58:41.920 --> 58:45.400
I think if they're if it's going to be like the other Q motion stuff

58:45.400 --> 58:50.680
Which is essentially you buy like something that looks like a bowling ball something looks like a you know

58:50.680 --> 58:56.520
Golf club and something like that. I don't know how popular that's gonna be it'll be nifty

58:56.680 --> 59:01.320
but it's not gonna be something that I think you'd have to go run out right away and buy and

59:01.920 --> 59:06.180
Also, I would I would like to see them to come up with something a little bit more universal

59:06.180 --> 59:11.080
So you're not buying this huge peripheral for one game because I'm kind of retarded

59:11.640 --> 59:16.560
but I don't know we'll have to see what they come up with I think it's gonna be hard for them not to

59:17.400 --> 59:19.400
be kind of

59:19.400 --> 59:22.560
Accused of ripping off Nintendo, so

59:23.480 --> 59:27.760
Because even Sony was accused of ripping off Nintendo when that six axis was thrown in at the last minute

59:27.760 --> 59:32.760
Remember that that and that was wasn't even really the same thing. You know what I mean, but still though

59:32.760 --> 59:38.540
It's just like oh, and now it has motion sensitive stuff and and really

59:39.080 --> 59:42.880
Would that pan out to I mean hardly any games use it. So I

59:43.640 --> 59:45.080
don't

59:45.080 --> 59:47.000
All right

59:47.000 --> 59:52.100
Anyhow, we got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're gonna be getting to the skype line here very shortly

59:52.680 --> 59:55.760
But this next story requires some music

59:58.840 --> 01:00:04.040
And you know what that means somebody earned themselves a stupid award this week in some horrific

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.520
Amount of violence and the person who wins the stupid award on olr this week is Edward Stoddard

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.340
Congratulations. He was arrested in Dade City and you know what he did

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:21.100
He murdered his neighbor over a missing PlayStation 3. That's right

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:28.220
He murdered Douglas Abrams because they were arguing over the PlayStation 3 on April 24th

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:35.940
No really word on what it was that they were specifically arguing about but it just kind of begs the question is a PlayStation 3

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.340
really worth killing someone over

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.260
That's what I would have been playing grand thought of for on said PlayStation 3

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.380
But it just goes to show you know

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.980
Regardless, you know, obviously this guy obviously has issues. He needs to he needs to play Wii ethics

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.620
Is it appropriate to kill someone over a missing video game console? Yes or no?

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.140
And if you say yes, then the console spits acid at you or something, I don't know. But wait, that's that's not good

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.140
That's awesome. All right

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.260
Whoa wrong answer die you need to be rinsing acid

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.260
But

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.820
What

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.660
Instead of it being like, you know, highly corrosive acid

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:20.500
It should be like minor lee corrosive acid so that they're left with chemical burns and you all know that they scored wrong

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.100
You I think that would be great. You've got issues

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:31.180
No, because it wouldn't kill them. It just maimed them a little and everyone would know that they're stupid. All right

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.500
Anyway, stupid award stories usually make me a little bit angsty and also the fact that I forgot to put it anywhere else

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500
Yeah

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:44.620
That's right, I caught it I can't save myself. Yeah CF use of the week

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:05.940
My fu of the week now, I told Rob what it was on Friday, but I've decided to expand it a little bit and

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.940
my

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:14.260
My fu of the week is to people who buy into what they're told without

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:22.380
Researching it first and my primary example was the practice of circumcising little boys. Ow

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.860
crossing legs

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.860
because I

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:30.440
understand that for religious purposes as part of your culture, but

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:37.160
For purpose of aesthetics or thinking that it's healthy. No, it's not and actually it

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.560
Ends up being very traumatic and also makes them getting the nookie a lot less satisfying

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.800
this

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.920
so also in the same tone then it goes to people who think that

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.400
just because

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.320
Specialist a has said oh this is you know

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.080
Not what you want to do this suddenly it's law and I'm not gonna go into specifics on that in particular

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.600
but there's

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.680
Okay, actually I'm gonna sort of go into specifics on this one

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:18.640
That's right that there being some sort of widespread rumor that if you were a massage therapist

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:26.080
And you were suddenly in adult entertainment and this way I get really pissed off at the whole happy ending bullshit because

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.800
because of people who

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.280
Think that and those jokes that go around. I haven't been able to get my business license for six months

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.040
So don't I'm very very very angry about that, but they've revamped

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:48.520
The requirements for it in my uh in my town and made it up to where I can, you know, get my license again

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.280
It's also goes towards people who you know

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.560
It's really just a bunch of what we think a bunch of what?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.440
we accept as fact in our daily lives is really in

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:10.560
In most cases the result of sensationalism and people trying to tell us what they want us to think so that we'll spend money in said

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.640
Area so that more money will go into the pockets of people who?

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.200
You know are lying to us basically

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.340
So I say research everything yourself before you believe what you see on TV or what you hear from from people

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.160
That's a lot to say

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:33.640
All right, I think for yourself reject false icons. Yes reject false icons Loki after you driving to and from Oakland

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.200
If I can hate that drive

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:42.400
It's long and boring and it's Oakland. It's Oakland. Um, my heavy. Is that it? Hey, yeah, it's a long drive

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400
You're like, oh, yeah, Oakland

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.380
There's a yummy Indian food place in Oakland eight Ellen

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.560
Speaking of food at you to the news

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.720
I got this week that due to my pancreatus I had back in April when I was in the hospital for a few days

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:03.000
If you did the fact that I will be stuck on a low-fat diet for two more months, which means no Indian food

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.560
Well, I guess there's some Indian food dishes I can have but no garlic naan or the stuff

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:12.020
I really like for two more months at least and the fact that that means I can't have cake or ice cream on my 30th

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.500
Birthday that kind of blows but at least I'd rather be eating low-fat than be dead

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.420
So if you did that and if you did the fact that on top of you know dealing with all that

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:26.120
I think I'm getting a cold or something. So F you to being sick twice at the same time. It kind of sucks. I

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Just want this year to go away

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.360
The show has been good though. That's one good thing about it. The show's been great

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.560
All right

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.520
Hippolytus and chat asks, dude, how much weight has sky lost? 25 pounds. I lost 25 pounds

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.720
I used to have quite a bit of a little bit of a beer gut now

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.440
I have a tiny little beer gut and

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.280
I'm gonna be starting to work out soon because I'm starting to feel a lot better like my chest and everything

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:54.560
So it's gonna be I'm gonna have abs by the time all is said and done. We'll see at least that's the goal

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.680
All right

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:05.220
Let's move on to the skype line we're gonna be taking some calls on the skype line

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.680
You can call us at 1 8 7 7 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.140
We don't have time for a lot of calls tonight, but we'll definitely try to get some calls

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.700
In so you can call us right now while we wait for some calls

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:26.220
Do you have a quick last-minute story for us Matt? Yeah prototypes been delayed to 2009. What's prototype is this game?

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:31.340
It's like crackdown, but you're like a mutant you crazy shit jump around big sandbox game

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.580
Interesting come out this fall

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.980
2009 now

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:41.020
Well, that's too bad. Yeah, anything else? Uh kill zone 2 is officially announced for February 2009

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.820
So that's pretty awesome. I think resistance still coming out this fall

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.860
So and then we have that to look forward to but kill zone 2 pretty cool

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.880
There was some footage online for that, but apparently got yanked because it wasn't supposed to be out yet. Oh

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.380
Well, that sucks. Let's go to Z phones

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.460
Hello, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this? Oh

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:08.680
My god, it's clicky the pen clicky who gave you access to a telephone

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.680
I

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.800
I'm sorry sky he he must have butt-dialed you guys or something. I don't know. I was crying

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:23.480
It's what it's Bobby was clicky trying to flirt with the ferret. I think that's what it was. I think he's demanding ransom

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:29.440
I think he knows where the ferret is. I think clicky kidnapped the ferret for money. That's that's amazing

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.160
What's on your mind Bobby to what do we owe this call tonight?

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.080
Or was it just clicky trying to get through it was clicky trying to get through but hi, but now that you're here

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:41.000
Oh any anything in news? This is a very busy week for news. I

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:46.920
Know you talked to it's always funny because you know you do the show that's on right before us on all games calm at five

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.600
o'clock Pacific and you were talking about the whole DRM digital rights management thing, which I

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.840
Read about earlier this week and I was like I want to talk about it this week on orange launch radio

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.960
And then it didn't even make it in our show role because I forgot

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.840
All right

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.720
Well low key get some up what happened real quick because I want to get Bobby's opinion on this and our other opinions

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:14.240
Originally EA came up with this wonderful idea that both Mass Effect and spore. We're gonna need to be

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.040
Validated via I guess an online call home thing every 10 days

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.120
And if it didn't do that it wouldn't work anymore, so

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.800
That sucked, but then they came out and decided hey

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.160
We're not gonna do that because people don't like that kind of thing so now Mass Effect's only it's gonna

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.840
Authenticate itself when you first install it and then if you download any additional download content

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.600
It'll redo that as well same as spore spore once you install it and also if you connect to online

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.040
So a Bobby what are your thoughts on this?

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.240
I don't want to spoil your whole show because I know you you go into it on your show

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.320
But what quickly what were kind of your thoughts on this issue?

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:02.600
Well my thing was more because you know they're trying to market spore because will right is was on the Colbert report

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.720
He's been doing the late-night talk show rounds

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.560
They're trying to market spore to a larger audience than just gamers and not every person who has a computer

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.800
actually has

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.480
Internet access from their home either they use it for work, or they go to a public library or something you know

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.000
They may have a decent computer, but it may not necessarily be online

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.160
And so you know even that one-time activation may be a problem for some people because they're used to just getting this DVD

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:35.080
Or CD and sticking in their computer and playing and now you can't do that now you have to have this other charge

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.240
You have to have internet service from your home

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.940
Just to play it and the reason that they got rid of the 10-day

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.000
Phoning home every 10 days was actually because of the US Armed Forces

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.400
They can't guarantee an internet connection when they're overseas, but they still play games on their PC

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.400
They do have downtime to get their mind off of what they're doing right, and I think that's why they got rid of the 10-day

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.000
Restriction, but there's still that first time and then any other time when you're online

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.560
Then it will check, but it's not going to force you

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.360
But I think it still leaves out a segment of the population that doesn't have internet at home

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.120
Why would think especially in the case of the Armed Forces who are doing you know a big job?

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.560
That not a lot of people want to do for this country

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.720
I would hope that EA

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.200
Would come up with a way that they can bypass it at least the Armed Forces can get a special version of the game or

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.920
Something now granted you know there's a special version of the game that the Armed Forces got it would be on the internet that yeah

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.380
I guess that's the unfortunate side of that is that would happen, but somehow like I don't know

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:31.800
There's got to be something that even they do even with this. I think it's gonna be broken

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:37.880
It doesn't matter everybody finds a way to get past everything. That's true. It wasn't didn't Bioshock do something similar

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.840
Yeah, but people found ways around that yeah

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.640
And people like you would only let you install it on so many computers

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.040
And it had to connect to the internet each time and then once it hit its limit too bad so sad. I guess yeah

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.800
Yeah, something like that

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.240
Frisbee points out in chat room the portal retail version requires online to start up which

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.660
Well, I don't know because I bought it on steam and steam does all that copy protection stuff

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.600
You know kind of as part of I think you have to have steam when you buy the retail version. Oh, oh, that's right

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.600
That's right. I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago. Not that I know or anything, but they found a way around that

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.600
You you heard I heard yeah, okay?

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:23.240
Is that from your independent research that you did it's from I own I own the orange box on you know Xbox 360

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.240
I just want to see would look like I'm a PC

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.960
All right Bobby anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:37.400
No, that's that that was it. It was I blame eight wait a minute click clicky. Don't come back. Don't talk about the ferret clicky

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.600
Click that's not nice clicky. Yeah. Yeah, I know they've got an explicit tag clicky, but go away. Sorry about that Rob

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:50.440
No, that's that's quite. Okay. You know I'm thinking maybe click clicky in the ferret could get their own show that no one would listen

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440
to no one

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.040
Except maybe Jamie

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.680
She's making pouty face at me all right bye Bobby bye clicky bye Rob go away click

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.920
All right, black boy in chat says I would totally listen to that show so there you have it

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.800
What exactly would clicky in the ferret talk about what do pens and ferrets have in common? I'm not sure

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.120
They're long. That's true as go to the phones. We have more calls. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.480
Hi, this is a deaf hello act-deaf. Hey good submission good effort in the challenge tonight

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.800
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you, but you know I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.480
But it's tough. I asked this to 100 Matt kind of he did something similar to what you did

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.720
I think that might have been part of the problem, and he just I think he does radio stuff

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.160
So we had a slight advantage, but good for him. Yeah. Yeah, he did a way better job than me

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.960
But we still I hope that he can win

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.680
We still appreciate the effort and are feeling the love very much to what do we owe this call tonight act-deaf

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:02.840
Well basically I was going to congratulate Matt for winning and

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.680
Like I said, I hope that he gets all our

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560
How do you say it?

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.560
support for him to win the old games calm a contest overall I

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Though I hope he

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.600
he gives a

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.760
The console to Loki because I was going to do that if I won all you act-deaf was serious

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.000
He was going to give you the console if you want

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.640
And I would not have let him do that because that's a foolish thing to do I would have made him keep it

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.360
Not a foolish thing to do I would have been watching your mailbox when I see this big box

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.040
I mean from Mexico. I would have written died

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.640
Expired

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.680
That doesn't work by the way

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.520
Have you tried doing that to just try that with junk mail?

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.520
Deceased no, they don't believe it if I know hey, well someone was there to write deceased on it

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:04.920
So therefore the more junk is that all you want to say act-deaf day any anything going on in your gaming world this week?

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.360
Basically much, it's pretty much that I haven't been gaming that much. I have been working and

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:20.600
And other stuff, but I'm pretty looking forward to spacing by there's extreme. Oh, yes, man. I have I

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.480
Have seen some of the videos and and oh my god. That's awesome. It's an awesome game

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:32.720
I think it reminds me of rest. I played it for about three minutes, and it was an awesome three minutes

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.000
I definitely am gonna pick this game up on my PSP. It's it's it's got a great yes

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.600
It is on the ds2 yeah, I think I'm gonna get on PSP

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.080
Just just for the heck of it so and it's going to be pretty cheap. Also. It's not it's like $20 on GameStop

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.880
Yeah, I think it's 20 bucks

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.120
It's very it's cheap, and I think it'll be good

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.400
I will review the game in full a little later on as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.680
So well act I was looking forward act F

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.440
take a break from making radio ads this week and definitely play some more games if you can and

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.480
We're gonna need your help so that we can get SSJ 100 Matt to win the contest at all games

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.680
So as soon as I know how how he can do that. We'll fill you in

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.720
Okay, all right. Thanks. All right. Take care, buddy

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.200
If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.560
Olr our username on Skype is orange lounge radio meanwhile. Do we have any other last-minute stories? Oh wait

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.440
No, just kidding. We have another call hi on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.480
Hey, it's DJ tired. Hey DJ Tyron. How are you doing good?

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.960
That was a fun Mario Kart match last night by the way. I don't remember most of it

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.400
What why not do you not remember me kicking your ass? I was a little

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:52.000
Drinky drinky you were drunk play Mario Kart online. Yeah, I just I just gotten home. I'm like what am I gonna do?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.160
I don't wanna go to sleep yet

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.080
So I put popped in Mario Kart, and I was able to navigate the menu shoes perfectly fine

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.040
But once I got in the game it was it was all downhill from there

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.700
No, wonder you kept coming in last, and I was blaming it on the fact that you now

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:08.020
Did you know that we actually were broadcasting that whole thing on Justin TV?

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.240
Dude go to the Justin TV archives and look cuz the whole thing is broadcast

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.340
I'm totally making fun of everybody using the wheel because I'm like look the people winning

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.060
Using the wheel the people not winning. I mean the people winning not using we all the people not winning using the wheel

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.860
So that is so funny

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:25.320
I had no idea

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.520
Do it and you had no idea because we were actually like I was on just TV doing something else that I'd promised the listeners

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:35.920
last week. Somehow, in Justin TV chat, they were like, play Mario Kart, play Mario Kart.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.720
So I went in there, logged into Mario Kart, and it was like me, Rama, and then Dark Tetsuya,

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.080
and then you joined out of nowhere. I was like, oh, Jimmy must have saw us on Justin

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.800
TV. That is so funny. So you were drinking.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.040
Yeah. When you connect to Wi-Fi, if there's like one of your friends with an open room,

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:54.400
it has like a smiley face next to friends. And I was like, will that be?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.300
I didn't know that. Okay, that's helpful. Wow, what a good case of timing, though. But

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.440
shame on you for drinking and driving. I know. It was bad.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.200
But I guess if you're gonna do it, then you gotta do it in Mario Kart. I guess that's

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.120
the safest place to drink and drive. Exactly.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.120
Nice. Awesome. Or GTA 4.

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.360
Huh? Or GTA 4.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.320
So that's why you picked Rainbow Road, because I was like, oh god.

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.520
No, I did random. I did not want to play Rainbow Road. I hate that level so much.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.880
Oh, okay. Okay. Alright. Because I was cursing you out when you picked it.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.360
I could tell. Everyone was hating me at that point, and if there was voice chat, it wouldn't

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.200
have been very pretty. Yeah, maybe that's why Nintendo banned voice

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.160
chat, so it spares us like a drunken Jim. Anything? Did you call in to talk about something

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.200
else tonight, Jimmy? I totally derailed it to Mario Kart.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.680
No, no, that was it. Oh, okay. You were calling to make excuses

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.360
for your drunken performance last night. Yep.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.360
Alright, that's fine. Alright, well, we'll have to play a sober match sometime. Maybe

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.600
you can represent the OLR crew when we do our big epic battle with Bobby Black Wolf

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.600
later. Okay.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.800
Alright. Take care, Jimmy. Hey, thanks for getting me on the show.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.120
No problem. Bye. Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.640
line tonight, because we went really long with the match game thing, and we want to

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.920
try to end it at a decent hour tonight. So, Loki, please finish up any other last minute

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:13.400
stories you might have tonight. Okay. Let's see here. Well, first off, let's

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:19.240
talk real quick. We mentioned a lot of stuff about Rock Band earlier. Apparently, well,

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.680
first off, they've got some new stuff coming out this week, of course. Hanging on Telephone

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.600
by Blondie, Train in Vain by The Clash, and Cool Thing by Sonic Youth. So, that's pretty

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:33.720
awesome. All going to be two bucks, or 160 Microsoft points.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:42.240
There's also some, I guess, tracks on sale. All sorts of stuff between, I guess, now and

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:50.560
June 2nd. I guess two per week are going to be half price, or 80 Microsoft points. So,

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.860
I guess, this week there was Crush Crush Crush by Paramore, and Boston's Rock and Roll Band.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:04.560
I guess, later this week, there was Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia, and Faith No More's

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:12.280
We Care A Lot, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's Gimme Three Steps. And then, I'm not sure what's

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:20.800
coming up later. Let me see here real quick. Next week, there's going to be Shockwave,

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:27.080
Black Tide, and Sugar Magnolia by Grateful Dead. And then, the week after that, We Care

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:34.840
A Lot, I guess Faith No More, and All the Small Things by Blink-182. And then, finally,

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:40.000
I guess, last week is going to be Gimme Three Steps by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Dirty Little

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.460
Secret by All American Rejects. If you want more information, Major Nelson had a story

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:53.080
on it, so you can check that out. Half price. And, Activision, during their conference call,

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:58.440
there's going to be no new Tony Hawk game in 2008. However, they did say that there

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.240
was, I guess, kind of contradicting themselves a little bit, a new Tony Hawk game exclusive

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:11.120
to the DS this year, that's going to utilize new technology not seen on the DS. So, maybe

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.200
another sort of plug-in or something for the Game Boy Advance slot, kind of similar to

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:23.120
Guitar Hero on tour. I guess we'll have to see. This week, also, there's a ton of demos

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:29.000
being released on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, Born Conspiracies on there, Haze

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.200
on the PlayStation 3, Grid, which you got to check out, awesome racing game that's on

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:40.760
both. And, next week, or actually, a few weeks from now, June 5th, there's going to be Battlefield

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:47.200
Bad Company, in case you didn't get into the beta. New Xbox Live arcade game coming in

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:53.340
June, Vigilante 8 Arcade, which, you know, Vigilante 8 was a fucking awesome game. It's

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:58.040
also going to have download content. No word when in June it's coming, but at least I have

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:06.720
a month nailed down. Gran Turismo shipped 50 million units total for the entire franchise,

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:13.920
and that's globally, so that's pretty awesome. Let's see here. This sounds pretty cool. I

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.800
didn't actually, well, I played a little bit of Namco X Capcom, or Cross Capcom, but now

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:26.880
there's a new game coming out called Cross Edge, and it's got characters from Capcom,

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:34.880
Nippon Ichi, Namco Bandai, Gust, and Idea Factory. It's going to be an RPG, including

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:41.200
characters from all sorts of different things. They have characters from Disgaea, Darkstalkers,

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:49.400
Artolico, I guess, all sorts of stuff. This is coming from Famitsu magazine, which has

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:57.240
some nifty screenshots for that. Looks like Morgan's in there, and Etna, and I'm not sure

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:04.960
who else. Oh, Donovan, and looks like, who else. Lots of people though. Looks pretty

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.160
awesome. I like AJ Mix's idea for a game in chat. Everyone cross everyone. I like that.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.760
Me too. Now this is kind of neat, and remember I think a few weeks ago when we were trying

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:22.160
to show off Crisis Core, it really pissed me off, but thank God for the homebrew community.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:32.480
On the PSP, there is a new homebrew update called FUSA Build 032. What it does is allows

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:38.240
people with custom firmwares to use the video out and use any sort of cord they want, so

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:45.060
whether it be a composite, component, S-video, or D-terminal, they can use it on their TV,

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:52.720
play games, and they have a whole bunch of other options for that. Something that should

01:22:52.720 --> 01:23:00.960
have been done anyways in a firmware update, I think, but whatever. Let's see here. We've

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:10.560
got one more thing here. This is kind of funny. There's a, I guess this gaming device called

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.160
Bob that's being released, and what it is, is it's a way for parents, they would hook

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:22.000
it up to a console of their choice, and they can set time limits for the amount of games

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000
that kids can play. So it kind of looks like a giant calculator, and it will shut the power

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.040
off after a certain amount of time, and it's password protected. So it's kind of neat.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:42.600
And then finally, I have to show this to you, Rob. They're going to release this on cell

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:48.500
phone games from Gameloft. They're remaking the Oregon Trail. Nice. And it's done all

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:54.840
fancy-like, and I can totally see this coming to the DS at some point. Wow, it looks like

01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:00.120
Oregon Trail does battle. That's kind of weird looking. Yeah. Interesting. All fancy-like,

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:05.240
but yeah, you can check it out. Hey look, as long as I can make a character named Jamie

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:13.920
and she dies of cholera. Heart. But that is it. All right. Hey, at least it wasn't dysentery

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:23.240
because dysentery is so cliche. All right. Anyhow. That is why I hope I catch malaria.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.360
And I don't know, Jamie, you should check this out on Kotaku. They have the ultimate

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.420
in horse riding simulation. I just thought of Final Furlong when I saw it. It looks like

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:36.720
an actual horse. Hump a horse, the game. Yeehaw. And the person's even dressed up. Like a jockey.

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.200
Like a horse? No. Are they humping? A horse riding a horse. Oh my god, a horse riding

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:47.520
a horse. But a horse is a horse. Of course, of course. All right. That's going to do it

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.240
for- A horse riding horse? How can that be? That's going to do it for another week of

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.920
Orange Lounge Radio, but first we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.920
Dark Soccer, your final thought? Reject false icons. But I have an addition to that now.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:10.880
Think with your brain, not the TV guide. My final thought is reject the common cold. Loki.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.640
Need to play more ranked. Granted, I thought of four multiplayer. Oh, and sorry for people

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:22.100
that see me online around 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock Pacific time. Yeah, because we do

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:30.200
our online inter-employee games, and I accidentally invited people sometimes to that, and I haven't

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:36.960
kicked them. Sorry, Jason51. Anyways, that's what's going on there. All right. So 10 a.m.

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.160
and 3 p.m. not good GTA times for Loki. Yeah, noon though. Sometimes we'll leave it open

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.000
during noon. All right. All right, that's going to do it for another week of Orange

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.240
Lounge Radio. My name is Rob Roberts. That's Dark Soccer. That's Loki, and we're out of
