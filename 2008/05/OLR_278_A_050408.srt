00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:23,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, May 4th, 2008, some gaming companies drop out of this year's E3, Atari is getting bought, and is there actually a way to add storage to your

2
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:35,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:44,083
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that podcast on the internet and live talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,824
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:49,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:51,047
[SPEAKER_09]: She has the night off.

7
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:56,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually happen to know that she is hanging out with one of the OLR lesbians tonight.

8
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,732
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long time since we've had OLR lesbians on the show, but it's because...

9
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Meg Z's back in Wisconsin and Chris is actually moving out to Wisconsin as well.

10
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:08,376
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're sadly not going to have them on the show for quite a while after that.

11
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:14,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're having their last, I guess, girly weekend or whatever girls do before Chris moves.

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,642
[SPEAKER_09]: What do girls do, Rice Princess, who's joining us tonight?

13
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:19,203
[SPEAKER_09]: A very special guest filling in tonight.

14
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:20,503
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes shopping.

15
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,404
[SPEAKER_09]: He goes shopping?

16
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:21,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

17
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:22,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And talk about the lies?

18
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:22,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

19
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, but not if you're a lesbian, I guess.

20
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:26,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

21
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:33,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, then they do other things like, I don't know, chopping death.

22
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:35,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Chopping wood and stuff.

23
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:35,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Knock it off.

24
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:39,175
[SPEAKER_09]: The smart-ass you hear over there is one and only Techmaster Loki.

25
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:40,696
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, Loki?

26
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:43,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, except this cord is, like, attached to the...

27
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:44,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see you next time.

28
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, mustard.

29
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,208
[SPEAKER_07]: What in the hell?

30
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,190
[SPEAKER_09]: The show is completely disorganized tonight.

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Delicious mustard.

32
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

33
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:12,673
[SPEAKER_09]: First the mics are tangled, then you're spilling mustard on yourself.

34
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:16,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the problem is because she's sitting over here instead of sitting over in Jamie's abyss over there.

35
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:20,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of that, I have to move this stupid thing around the chair.

36
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just scoot back.

37
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:25,061
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to get her pretty little face on cam, even though the cam is kind of sucking tonight.

38
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,143
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

39
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:27,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine.

40
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Except I have mustard on me.

41
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,167
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week outside of the goddamn mustard?

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,162
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

43
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:57,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember them of the Shoes and Apparel website.

44
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,668
[SPEAKER_04]: They have commercials now on TV and stuff.

45
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:10,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went there, got the tour, and then we demoed games there, which I got to play quite a few of them because that's what I was doing is playing games.

46
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:20,228
[SPEAKER_04]: And then basically, you know, just kind of teaching them the basics about games and stuff, just throwing some, like, facts out there for them, basically just to get them excited about games.

47
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool, though.

48
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,073
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a DDR Supernova machine there, so I got to play that for a little bit.

49
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:31,999
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, uh, what else did we play there?

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,888
[SPEAKER_04]: We had, um, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue set up, which, I mean, that game looks good, but, you know, I just never was really interested in the Gran Turismo series, but it's pretty.

51
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:41,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them that.

52
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and got to use nice dual shocks and stuff, so it fell all the rumbles, which, you know, I guess that's neat.

53
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:51,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

54
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:51,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

55
00:03:52,997 --> 00:04:00,822
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had set up Mario Kart Wii, so I finally used the Wii Wheel instead of just hucking it out the door.

56
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:08,087
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, there's really hardly any difference between the Wii Wheel and just holding the controller sideways, and I hate it.

57
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:09,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely hate it.

58
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 4 Call of Duty 4

59
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:27,845
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Grand Theft Auto 4 set up because I brought my copy actually with me.

60
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:34,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually brought my 360 with me but ironically enough I didn't get a chance to actually play it in my hotel room at all.

61
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:46,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of sucked but I did play it at the event and I had already memorized a lot of the cheat codes so I was just spawning helicopters and chopping people with the rotor blades and stuff and just fun stuff like that and people seemed to enjoy it.

62
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we had Wii Sports being demoed and pretty much everything from that.

63
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:52,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Smash Brothers

64
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:57,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I had to play with the controller sideways, which I hate it.

65
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:00,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's it.

66
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:03,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we were demoing for them, and they really enjoyed it.

67
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Great company, to be honest.

68
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:10,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd work there tomorrow if I could, but they're all the way in Henderson, Nevada, and we're

69
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:12,819
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way out here in Sacramento.

70
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,660
[SPEAKER_04]: But shit, man.

71
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,942
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were out here, absolutely awesome company.

72
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Just everyone loved working there.

73
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: They cater lunch and breakfast every day.

74
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,448
[SPEAKER_04]: They have vending machines full of stuff that's all free.

75
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:31,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Just very fun going environment.

76
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:37,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, since you were getting into your gaming week, why don't you tell us a little more about what other types of games you've been playing this week?

77
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything outside of Vegas?

78
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:38,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

79
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, more Grand Theft Auto 4.

80
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:46,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally got our internet open at work, so now we can start doing the death matches online, which is awesome.

81
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:47,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Very looking forward to that.

82
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a five minute deathmatch with one of my co-workers and it was fun.

83
00:05:52,216 --> 00:06:02,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty hard to spot people, especially even with all the pedestrians running around because, you know, you do see their name above their head and stuff, but sometimes it's hard to spot them amongst all the pedestrians.

84
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:03,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty cool.

85
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And then today we just kind of played like a fuck-off game, you know, just a free play thing.

86
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:09,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was fun.

87
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:13,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that for about, I think, a good half hour, 45 minutes.

88
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:17,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, you know, flying around helicopters and just, you know,

89
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:18,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

90
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:40,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very, you know, looking forward to this game a lot.

91
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:46,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just worried, though, that... Because even, like, flying to the different islands and stuff, it's like, okay, now I've seen everything.

92
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:48,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, you know, I don't know.

93
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:52,496
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's still very confusing stuff driving around.

94
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:59,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, you know... It's hard to orient yourself a little bit more than, say, the other games because there's a lot less in those other games.

95
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

96
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:02,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good game.

97
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely a good game.

98
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:04,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And see what else I play.

99
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:05,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Crisis Core.

100
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that a little bit on the plane.

101
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I really can't get into that game very much.

102
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:11,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too linear.

103
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:13,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

104
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people have just been swooning all about Crisis Core, so I'm kind of surprised.

105
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very linear.

106
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't get a lot of places.

107
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:23,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can go explore a little bit, but it's very...

108
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:26,345
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

109
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:48,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I actually...

110
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:20,196
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of playing the game on my flight back, I decided to read the SkyMall magazine.

111
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:24,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I chose the SkyMall magazine over Crisis Core.

112
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,360
[SPEAKER_09]: SkyMall has some pretty sweet stuff in it.

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,281
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have some pretty interesting things in there.

114
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:33,203
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some things I was like, hey, that's a pretty cool idea.

115
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:34,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

116
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:35,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

117
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:36,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

118
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I played something else.

119
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was playing this web flash game.

120
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for Castle Crashers, but you're fighting a guy with a beard.

121
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:46,872
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

122
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a giant head with a beard.

123
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, it's a demo for Castle Crashers?

124
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:57,855
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like a flash game that the guy that created Castle Crashers made with the characters from Castle Crashers, and you're fighting a guy with a beard.

125
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

126
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the name of it.

127
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:04,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find it, but it was interesting.

128
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:05,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty.

129
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:07,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I never say this name right.

130
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize to this poor guy.

131
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,672
[SPEAKER_09]: WeToo says, Loki is reviewing a game, but nothing compares to his beloved Grand Theft Auto 4.

132
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:14,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that true?

133
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:16,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's good.

134
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:18,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I just enjoy it a lot more.

135
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:19,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

136
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:21,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that it's better than any game out there.

137
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:23,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I'm enjoying it a lot more right now.

138
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, once Saints Row 2 comes out, who knows?

139
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:31,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... Ossifer completely disagrees with you.

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,702
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Crisis Core is the downright best game on the PSP.

141
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that

142
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:52,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

143
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:58,779
[SPEAKER_04]: If they put Final Fantasy 7, like the actual 7 on there, I would probably say that would be pretty fun.

144
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy 1 on the PSP was pretty fun.

145
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

146
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Just maybe some more of the retro games, I guess.

147
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Space Invaders Extreme.

148
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked that game.

149
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:14,616
[SPEAKER_09]: That game did seem like a lot of fun.

150
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,857
[SPEAKER_09]: The few minutes I played the one you had.

151
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:17,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to buy it.

152
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:20,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something they need to bring to live in the PlayStation Network.

153
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, that would do so well for them.

154
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Invaders Extreme, by the way.

155
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:32,185
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like those Mizuguchi games, like Rez and stuff, or Every Extend Extra, mix that with Space Invaders.

156
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,785
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what Space Invaders Extreme is.

157
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:34,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty hot.

158
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:38,269
[SPEAKER_09]: because I am a huge... Like, Loki is to Grand Theft Auto.

159
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Mizuguchi.

160
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, everything he touches, I will defend.

161
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I even defended 99 Nights, okay?

162
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'll admit it.

163
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:47,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know what that is.

164
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:48,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what?

165
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:48,617
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta say that?

166
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:49,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what that is.

167
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:53,240
[SPEAKER_09]: 99 Nights came out on the Xbox 360 and it was kind of the... Dynasty Warriors.

168
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Once the game was just like, thank you, Dynasty Warriors, but it had its issues.

169
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,965
[SPEAKER_09]: But I came on the show and I was like, it's not a bad game.

170
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,306
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not good.

171
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It just needs a little work.

172
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Chrono Trigger

173
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:24,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

174
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:28,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I seem to remember a few weeks ago on this program, I took a lot of heat for not declaring it the best game ever made.

175
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Chrono Trigger is great.

176
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:37,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't care too much about Chrono Cross, wasn't really impressed by that Chrono Trigger remake they were doing, the 3D one.

177
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:37,412
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

178
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm not a 3D child.

179
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I am, like, strictly a 2D type of person, so that's why I didn't care for it.

180
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:47,499
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I'm kind of a boring person when it comes to games.

181
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,560
[SPEAKER_09]: You like your games very two-dimensional and vanilla.

182
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally, yeah.

183
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,682
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the 2D games with that 3D kind of look to them?

184
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't know, Beautiful Joe, kind of?

185
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:57,444
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's cool with me.

186
00:11:57,944 --> 00:12:00,045
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, okay, it's case by case.

187
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not strictly I won't play any 3D games.

188
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:03,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I play 3D games.

189
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just my preference.

190
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:12,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that they put more effort into the game when it's 2D because they're not focusing on trying to make it look all cool because it's 3D.

191
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

192
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:15,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Nintendo forever.

193
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:16,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from chat.

194
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Cyran says, and probably another name I'm mispronouncing, but you know what?

195
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:20,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I do that.

196
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:21,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm mispronouncing.

197
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:22,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amateur radio.

198
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:25,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Chrono Trigger equals not that great.

199
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you equals not that great.

200
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Ossifer says, 99 Nights, I remember being reviewed on X-Play with a girl screaming horribly.

201
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember watching X-Play and I was screaming horribly.

202
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:40,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You're such a dork.

203
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:42,956
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week?

204
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,317
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

205
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:45,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming Loki's done.

206
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:46,698
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's not, I cut him off.

207
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,920
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week?

208
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

209
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Boring.

210
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:54,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I played WoW and I started playing Puzzle Pirates again.

211
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerd.

212
00:12:56,986 --> 00:13:01,549
[SPEAKER_09]: If for whatever reason, let's say a listener of this show has never heard of Puzzle Pirates before, is it a free MMO?

213
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it went from beta to charge, and now they have kind of this system where you can play for free and then buy certain aspects of the game with real money.

214
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:13,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you want to have Johnny Depp hair?

215
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

216
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:18,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Like clothes or an island or something like that, you can pay for it.

217
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But essentially, it's just a big puzzle game.

218
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,141
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've ever played something like Puzzle Quest or something, it's kind of sort of like that, but in a pirate setting.

219
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,841
[SPEAKER_07]: You sail the ship by playing a puzzle.

220
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,482
[SPEAKER_07]: You bilge the stations.

221
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:31,622
[SPEAKER_07]: You do carpentry.

222
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,122
[SPEAKER_07]: All that crap, you know.

223
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,903
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're all, like, PopCap games, basically.

224
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:36,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Bill Jean is, like, bejeweled, right?

225
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:36,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

226
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:37,685
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much like that.

227
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:39,125
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them was, like, Dr. Mario.

228
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it was the sailing one.

229
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:41,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

230
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:41,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

231
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:42,727
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah.

232
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:44,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically what it is.

233
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's fun, and it's addictive, and, like... It is.

234
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like PopCap, the MMO with pirates.

235
00:13:49,790 --> 00:14:12,769
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly that is exactly what it is that's a great description so but it's really fun and i like have been spending countless hours playing i know a few people that have really gotten sucked into puzzle pirates yeah a few people on my live journal on the friends list they just always talk about you know puzzle pirates it's good time it's like wow for the puzzle crowd i guess you could say all right yeah pretty cool that's pretty much it all right what do you do

236
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:13,929
[SPEAKER_09]: My Gaming Week.

237
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:18,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I must be... I feel like the one person on the planet who has not been all getting into Grand Theft Auto 4.

238
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:19,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my thing.

239
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:22,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I like... Let me put this.

240
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I respect Grand Theft Auto 4.

241
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is a good game.

242
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,793
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just not kind of like my thing.

243
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:30,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I have this big concern that I'm going to spend $60 in this game.

244
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:34,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't really play Grand Theft Auto for the story because I'm just not into those types of stories.

245
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:35,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

246
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:36,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

247
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But you see, like, you say that about it, but, I mean, it's kind of like WoW.

248
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,973
[SPEAKER_07]: You do the exact same thing over and over, day after day.

249
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:06,995
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something more, WoW has a chat room, I can't explain it.

250
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:10,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess that's a good point, but I mean, actual gameplay aspects.

251
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow is a giant chat room with spells.

252
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, basically, you know?

253
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:16,939
[SPEAKER_07]: That is kind of true.

254
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,081
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, like, there is going to be the, you know, there's the online element to it.

255
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:21,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know.

256
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:27,263
[SPEAKER_07]: You would just, I think if you pick it up and play it, you might get more into it than you actually think you would, Rod.

257
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:28,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just me.

258
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:29,264
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

259
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, J-Rod says, why doesn't Sky just borrow it from Loki?

260
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he keep it in a fireproof safe guarded by pitbulls or something?

261
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,470
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not a fireproof safe.

262
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the safety deposit box that came with my special edition.

263
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:46,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I would think that Loki just wants to hang on to it for a little while.

264
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:48,953
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll probably let me borrow it in like six weeks.

265
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't really let you borrow it because I have to use it at work when we play our weekly deathmatches.

266
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I have four copies of the game right now.

267
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:00,876
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta love that.

268
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki has four copies of the game and he won't let me borrow one.

269
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:09,640
[SPEAKER_04]: We have five people that want to play it at work, and in fact, I need to get another copy of it.

270
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

271
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

272
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I will buy it eventually.

273
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:16,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know when that's going to be.

274
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,884
[SPEAKER_07]: He's only got four copies, Rob.

275
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I will find you one.

276
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:20,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

277
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:21,466
[SPEAKER_04]: God.

278
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:22,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

279
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:22,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry about it.

280
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:23,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

281
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:23,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You know me.

282
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:24,708
[SPEAKER_04]: You know me.

283
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:27,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta play one of the best games of, you know, the Xbox 360.

284
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna find it for me.

285
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna play it for three hours and then Irene's gonna call and be all like, Rob, Karazhan tonight.

286
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be like, bye, Grand Theft Auto.

287
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll loan it to you and then you'll be like, I haven't had a chance to play it.

288
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing World of Warcraft.

289
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:44,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what it would be like.

290
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Like three weeks later, hey, so how do you like Grand Theft Auto 4?

291
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I still haven't played it yet.

292
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:52,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm running heroic, Meg.

293
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:52,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

294
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XI for a little bit.

295
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:56,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't understand.

296
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:58,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Slave Pens was the daily heroic.

297
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to do it.

298
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Survivor came back on TV, so I had to watch that.

299
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't even joke about Survivor right now.

300
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,721
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I'm tangent.

301
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hosting an online Survivor game.

302
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:12,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll tell you what, one thing I love besides video game is cheesy reality shows.

303
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:14,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm actually hosting a Survivor game online right now.

304
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:17,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And the cast that's playing is very fierce.

305
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,544
[SPEAKER_09]: It's LiveJournal's Survivor.

306
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:30,079
[SPEAKER_09]: and I played it like last year and it was a lot of fun and the cast is in it right now funny I'm having so much fun watching them just kind of like because I get to see everything they write behind this it's funny I'm having a great time

307
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:32,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they like cutthroat and like bitchy?

308
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:39,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much I can say because some of them might be listening, but I'll just say everybody is definitely there to win.

309
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:40,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's fun.

310
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun to watch.

311
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:42,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.

312
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:43,492
[SPEAKER_09]: It's much better than that.

313
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:45,994
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there was like a Survivor PC game that came out.

314
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there were two of them that came out.

315
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Total shit.

316
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Total shit.

317
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:57,321
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them you could actually play online and you could actually be Richard Hatch and not pay your taxes and stuff.

318
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:57,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

319
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:02,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So, look, I make no apologies for things that I might like.

320
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:02,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really sorry.

321
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:09,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't play Grand Theft Auto because I was too busy hosting yet another Survivor online.

322
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:10,449
[SPEAKER_09]: No, next will be Big Brother.

323
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,430
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

324
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Survivor, Big Brother game.

325
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:17,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you know... Big Brother on an island.

326
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:24,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, you know, like, if... Okay, because you know Penny Arcade Expo is coming up, and there's going to be tons of people from all games there.

327
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:27,280
[SPEAKER_09]: You know if, like, all-game Survivor happened at PAX, it would be good stuff.

328
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be funny.

329
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,329
[SPEAKER_09]: All the challenges could be about video games.

330
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:32,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe not.

331
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:33,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

332
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, we have some housekeeping to talk about tonight.

333
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:39,948
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, as you've already figured out, DarkSakura's not here tonight.

334
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:43,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if she's going to be in to do the classic game tonight.

335
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,012
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a backup plan just in case, but DarkSakura's not here tonight.

336
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:56,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I have to apologize in advance specifically to FootyMonster and Toshin, because last week I promised epic match game tonight, and we're not going to be able to do it tonight because we don't have enough people.

337
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wasn't able to get together the...

338
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:03,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I had Warcraft and Survivor stuff to do.

339
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:03,960
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

340
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't able to round up some of the other stuff I wanted to do for tonight.

341
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,806
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why he does not get Grand Theft Auto 4 loaned to him.

342
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even talk about my gaming week, but I will in a minute.

343
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:14,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do housekeeping first.

344
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk about my gaming week.

345
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So there won't be match game tonight.

346
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:18,714
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to table it to next week.

347
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise we will have it next week.

348
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:23,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft Auto 4 Grand Theft Auto 4

349
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:56,595
[SPEAKER_09]: and we'd put the winners or I'm sorry the winners will be put into voting and your guys' favorite will be the finalist and the finalist will go over to allgames.com to compete against all the other finalists from the other like what 10 shows, 14 shows, I lost count however many shows are competing and

350
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's going to be fun.

351
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:58,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay, Rob.

352
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:04,257
[SPEAKER_04]: See, when I win this contest and win another copy of the game, I'll happen to loan you that one, too.

353
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:04,597
[SPEAKER_04]: How nice.

354
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:05,177
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

355
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:20,142
[SPEAKER_09]: What I did want to play for you guys is I promised last week, I said we got a really great entry from somebody who unfortunately is ineligible because for reasons beyond our control, namely the fact that the limited edition console that is the grand prize only works in the United States or North American regions, I should say.

356
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada, Mexico are fine, but it will not work in Europe either.

357
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's World of Randomness Do you have no free time?

358
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:26,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you tired of raising your children?

359
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:28,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Are your children little pussies getting beat up?

360
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:54,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drop them in front of the TV with Loki's World of Randomness.

361
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:59,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Run around a virtual world in a bingle outfit, while preforming random acts.

362
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:18,748
[SPEAKER_00]: It will teach your children important skills, such as, how to attach a laser to their pet cat, how to disembody heads, how to take pictures of guys kissing, or how to shout fuck, or a combination of all of the above.

363
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:31,651
[SPEAKER_02]: If your children suffer mental damage from playing this game or start killing their friends with their laser cats, it may result in a bonus lawsuit settlement from our legal department.

364
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:40,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect!

365
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:42,364
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a perfect example of an entry.

366
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:43,144
[SPEAKER_09]: It was beautiful.

367
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:47,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have damn well won if Martin was eligible, but he's not.

368
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's going to happen is that we're going to pick our favorites, like three, four finalists.

369
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:51,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

370
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:52,990
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on how many entries we get.

371
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,691
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still submit them, by the way.

372
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,311
[SPEAKER_09]: You have like five and a half hours.

373
00:21:56,652 --> 00:22:01,754
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you haven't submitted anything yet, you have time because you have until midnight Pacific tonight to get your entries in.

374
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:02,975
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can send those in.

375
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:04,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you're listening right now.

376
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:06,677
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're listening on the podcast, you're screwed.

377
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:07,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So

378
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,740
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to submit it in, you have like five and a half hours.

379
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,164
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you what, you don't have a lot of competition because only like a handful of people did it.

380
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:18,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess not that many people want the limited edition 1 and 8 Grand Theft Auto God.

381
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:18,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

382
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:19,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you.

383
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:21,109
[SPEAKER_04]: because they know that I'm going to win.

384
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,471
[SPEAKER_09]: You're an eligible asshole.

385
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:24,492
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

386
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:27,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, but I will say there are some other good ones too.

387
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:31,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We will play our favorites in a special podcast that will roll out sometime this week.

388
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:35,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can vote for them on our site, www.orangelandre.com.

389
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:41,506
[SPEAKER_09]: The special podcast will be like just eight minutes long with the finalists and you can vote so you know who you're voting for on orangelandre.com.

390
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:42,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

391
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:42,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

392
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:45,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So that winner will be announced next week's show.

393
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, did anyone else notice this is a slow news week this week, thanks to Grand Theft Auto 4?

394
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:53,018
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

395
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you're smiling evilly over there.

396
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:58,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just me that noticed it was a slow news week?

397
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

398
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:02,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't notice.

399
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:04,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was too busy playing Grand Theft Auto.

400
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:09,388
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week, since I skipped it earlier, really not a whole lot of new stuff.

401
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:12,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I haven't been playing WoW a lot lately.

402
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of took a break from WoW.

403
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:18,330
[SPEAKER_09]: One game I have been playing quite a lot of and I've kind of surprised myself is Mario Kart Wii.

404
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been having a lot of fun with Mario Kart Wii.

405
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't play with the wheel either.

406
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:25,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the wheel is kind of stupid and it doesn't control well for me.

407
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:29,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So I use the Nunchuck and Wiimote, which works great.

408
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like controlling it that way.

409
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:48,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

410
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:08,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

411
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:31,118
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, obviously the lack of voice chat and the lack of a decent friend code system.

412
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:37,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, nothing new that no one hasn't said about Nintendo before, but it's getting a little better.

413
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,542
[SPEAKER_09]: A little.

414
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:39,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby steps.

415
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo's making baby steps.

416
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:44,745
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have fun with Mario Kart Wii.

417
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:46,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the courses are amazing.

418
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:52,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the Koopa Cape, which is that level that's kind of like the island one with all the rivers.

419
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:57,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you actually go down into a pipe for part of it, and you're driving through the pipe, and then you come out.

420
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:58,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

421
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:02,035
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really like some of the course design in Mario Kart Wii.

422
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:03,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of wish there was more of them.

423
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:07,538
[SPEAKER_09]: J-Rod in chat asks, Hey Sky, whatever happened to Lost Odyssey?

424
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:09,479
[SPEAKER_09]: You ever finish that four-disc behemoth?

425
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,180
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

426
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,341
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I got towards the end of the first disc.

427
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:15,702
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm on the second disc of Lost Odyssey, actually.

428
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:20,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Irene called and was like, Rob, Karazhan.

429
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:22,905
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the end of Lost Odyssey.

430
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:26,207
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's a game I really, really do need to go back and beat because it was amazing.

431
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:27,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing story.

432
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:29,028
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

433
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:31,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we can get into tonight's news.

434
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:33,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray, I'll start tonight.

435
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:41,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of the Nintendo Wii, there is a special version of the Wii that is soon going to roll out to hotels.

436
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:42,978
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually going to be at the Westin Hotels.

437
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Westin is a pretty upscale chain of hotels.

438
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I was fortunate enough to stay in one in San Francisco once.

439
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:50,165
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really nice, kind of swanky hotels.

440
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:53,948
[SPEAKER_09]: They're actually going to be putting Wiis in their workout rooms.

441
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:55,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a Wii workout.

442
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,772
[SPEAKER_09]: or Weston Workout is the program and then the Wii is going to be in this.

443
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:00,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the interesting thing.

444
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:04,735
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii's that they're going to be getting, the games are in there automatically.

445
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,076
[SPEAKER_09]: No discs are required.

446
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:09,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming it's on the limited space that's in there.

447
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:15,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And the hotel, they're going to slowly add things like Wii Fit and Wii Sports.

448
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:23,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently this whole thing is kind of, quote, ideal for business travelers and families who want to stay energized while on the road.

449
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:29,006
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a quote from the press release that was put out by Nintendo and Weston earlier this week.

450
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:30,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think?

451
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of interesting.

452
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:35,308
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't see video games in workout rooms very often.

453
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:43,469
[SPEAKER_09]: But it just kind of goes to show that whole, like, you know, the whole Wii is an exercise machine craze that's going on.

454
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,270
[SPEAKER_09]: How many calories do you really lose playing Wii Sports?

455
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:48,142
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

456
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,026
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't know, boxing?

457
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you played boxing like a few times in a row?

458
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, the boxing's pretty good.

459
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta give that to you.

460
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:13,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that definitely does.

461
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Until you figure out actually how to play the boxing game and realize that all you have to do is flick your wrist.

462
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:19,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up, Loki!

463
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:23,069
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think that's a pretty cool idea.

464
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:29,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'd probably rather play that than hop on the treadmill or lift a bunch of weights, you know, or something.

465
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:34,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee asks, but what person is going to play Twilight Princess in a hotel workout room?

466
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:38,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't think that'll be one of the games that's on it because they said you can't put discs in here.

467
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:43,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming it's going to be games like, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Fit and the more active type games.

468
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:46,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't, if it's going to be in the workout room, why would they put Twilight?

469
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:49,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee in our chat also says, just put a DDR machine in there.

470
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:52,840
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a bad idea.

471
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,522
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR's been around for, what, 10 years now?

472
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:57,424
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't heard about that going into workout rooms?

473
00:27:57,484 --> 00:28:03,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Although DDR's kind of gotten into the mainstream in other places, such as school physical fitness programs we've heard a lot about.

474
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:04,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

475
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:05,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting.

476
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's really not a bad idea.

477
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:08,595
[SPEAKER_09]: How about DDR on the Wii?

478
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:10,798
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like workout times two, right?

479
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, totally, I think.

480
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also uber lame.

481
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: You were not a fan of DDR on the Wii.

482
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:18,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

483
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:25,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, hey, you remember how awesome hands and feet mode was in the PlayStation 2 DDRs?

484
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's bring that to the Wii.

485
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:29,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Except we'll do it with the Wii Remote.

486
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, guess what?

487
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It still sucks.

488
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:32,234
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

489
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:33,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it was that bad.

490
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:34,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's crap.

491
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:39,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's randomly thrown in there just for the fuck of it, and you look like an idiot doing that.

492
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,940
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to play with that, do you?

493
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

494
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:43,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have to play with hands and feet mode.

495
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:46,804
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, a couple things that I was disappointed about.

496
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:53,209
[SPEAKER_04]: One, you couldn't add up your own edit steps using the hands and feet mode or the Wii remote and stuff like that.

497
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:59,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and two, just their placement in the songs as they were is just kind of random.

498
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

499
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:04,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It just didn't really flow with the song at all.

500
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:05,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

501
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:06,296
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

502
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like, hey, look, you're burning more calories.

503
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:09,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

504
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

505
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to say one other thing about this story before we move on.

506
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,823
[SPEAKER_09]: The Westin workout is only going to be at 10 hotels across the United States.

507
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:17,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, obviously, there's workout rooms in all their hotels, I'm sure.

508
00:29:17,945 --> 00:29:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: But this Wii thing is only in 10 hotels for now.

509
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,529
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's in the big cities, New York, San Francisco, whatever.

510
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:27,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming this will roll out slowly to more and more hotels if it's successful.

511
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:28,873
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

512
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Because totally, I'm not going to stay at a hotel unless it has the Wii there.

513
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:32,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

514
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

515
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do that at home.

516
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,640
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be out at Disneyland all fucking day.

517
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,042
[SPEAKER_09]: You and Nelly are going to be tired as hell when you get back to the hotel.

518
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:17,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're going to want to go just die in the couch and watch TV or whatever.

519
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,285
[SPEAKER_09]: But the kids, they have energy.

520
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing but energy.

521
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,987
[SPEAKER_09]: So what better than for them to go to the workout room and burn some more of that energy?

522
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:28,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because kids totally want to go to the workout room.

523
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I can remember when I went to Disneyland, I was like, hell, let's go to the workout room.

524
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:32,891
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be so awesome.

525
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of like, hey, let's go down the arcade downstairs.

526
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I don't know, hey, let's go out to the pool.

527
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:38,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Go swim around some.

528
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:39,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Or hey, let's go run around.

529
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Or hey, how about we play some video games on the TV there?

530
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:46,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope your kids are twice as angry as you.

531
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:52,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, Loki, this is probably made for busy businessmen and women that go to places but not actually visit the place.

532
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent point.

533
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:16,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

534
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:17,162
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it says in the press release.

535
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, that makes all the difference.

536
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:24,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just get some work done instead and stop fucking playing around?

537
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:25,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I do this.

538
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a business traveler.

539
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I go teach in other places sometimes.

540
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:29,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't done it for a while.

541
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:30,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I go to L.A.

542
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,833
[SPEAKER_09]: or I go to wherever and I don't get put up at the Westin, but if I was the president of the company, I might.

543
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I might actually get a kick out of this.

544
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:39,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

545
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:40,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get a kick out of this.

546
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:46,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's worth all the thousands of dollars that they probably had to pay for it to be exclusive there, or Nintendo probably paid them off.

547
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:46,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

548
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:47,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

549
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:48,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to move on.

550
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,174
[SPEAKER_09]: New subject.

551
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:57,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another disappointing idea was the idea to remove Clover's credits from the Okami Wii version.

552
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised that Clover's been kind of getting the shaft ever since they were disbanded.

553
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,528
[SPEAKER_04]: He said shaft.

554
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I said Shaft.

555
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,180
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

556
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaft.

557
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:25,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's not a big surprise that with the Wii version of the game coming out, hell, let's just get it even sloppier and other than putting watermarks on our covers, let's just remove their... They didn't really work on the game.

558
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Capcom, according to the new game.

559
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:29,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Clover's Gone

560
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:50,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

561
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:51,572
[SPEAKER_09]: That was their excuse.

562
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:52,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, I'm not making it up.

563
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:53,213
[SPEAKER_04]: That was their excuse.

564
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:53,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

565
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty retarded.

566
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:58,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I could get the movie file from just a fucking video of it.

567
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:01,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called print screen, folks.

568
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:01,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Print screen.

569
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:06,240
[SPEAKER_04]: You put the movie file up and you take a screen capture and then you can crop it down.

570
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I guess you wouldn't know how to do that since you can't even fucking find a picture without a watermark.

571
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:13,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fucking lazy.

572
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,970
[SPEAKER_04]: What has Capcom gotten really lazy lately?

573
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

574
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:22,594
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the fucking Mega Man games and shit that they've got coming out and Street Fighter remakes and fucking remakes of other games.

575
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:25,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have an original idea left with them?

576
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:26,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

577
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:27,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

578
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:28,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Okami.

579
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been out before.

580
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:32,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy it now because you're a whore and you'll buy these stupid remakes.

581
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,880
[SPEAKER_04]: There is nothing different with the game other than it's ad waggle.

582
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you enjoy your fucking PS2 port.

583
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That rant had nothing to do with the credits getting cut.

584
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it sucks for Clover because God Hand was awesome.

585
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:50,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Okami haven't played it.

586
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from chat.

587
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:55,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Any quick thoughts, Rice Princess, before we go to chat?

588
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:55,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at all.

589
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Ossifer in chat says, Clover got shanked on that deal.

590
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:04,462
[SPEAKER_09]: They made the game, they went out of business, but WTF, they should still get the credit.

591
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:06,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, Capcom, we're lazy.

592
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:10,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Cyran says, Capcom, quickly, make Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

593
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orangeonsradio.com Okay, just so you know, they have...

594
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:24,679
[SPEAKER_04]: On Joystick, an actual video that was part of the end credit sequence with Clover's logo in there.

595
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And for one, I don't see why they couldn't just, I don't know, keep that video sequence since it's pretty badass looking anyways.

596
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:37,063
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, though, they can't do a screen capture of this thing?

597
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:39,804
[SPEAKER_04]: That boggles my mind.

598
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:40,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

599
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:45,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma says in chat, Loki, some of us missed it the first time around.

600
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:49,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

601
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,081
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry that you missed it the first time around.

602
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:55,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should, I don't know, keep up with games that are coming up.

603
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:57,646
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so rude.

604
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:01,750
[SPEAKER_09]: What if somebody doesn't have a PlayStation 2 and they couldn't play it the first time around?

605
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then, boo-hoo.

606
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:05,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to a friend's house.

607
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:09,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I don't know what to see.

608
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:10,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to tell you what.

609
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:14,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make a capture of the logo.

610
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:15,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do the impossible.

611
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:20,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at me, I'm fucking David Copperfield, pulling out impossible feats.

612
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:23,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have fun.

613
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:25,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to... Oh, look at this!

614
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:26,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, look at that!

615
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:27,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a screen capture!

616
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm fucking awesome!

617
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:31,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that must have been really hard!

618
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:35,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, seriously, do they have people working there that are complete idiots?

619
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so, I mean, with shit sliding through the watermark.

620
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

621
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:50,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about other Wii news, some pretty exciting developments in the virtual console world, especially if you are in the PAL regions, meaning Europe and the like.

622
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:54,315
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in the PAL regions, the return of the Hanabi Festival is coming.

623
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:58,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Hanabi Festival happened a few months ago, and it was like Japanese games all month.

624
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:01,219
[SPEAKER_09]: We got something similar over here.

625
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:04,301
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't make a festival out of it, but we started getting some Japanese games.

626
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:07,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what they're getting overseas on the virtual console?

627
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:20,271
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to get Final Soldier, Columns 3, Gradius 2, Star Parodier, Puyo Puyo 2, Cho Aniki is also scheduled to come out.

628
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:25,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't know what Cho Aniki is, you're just going to have to look it up on Wikipedia or something to understand its awesomeness.

629
00:36:26,235 --> 00:36:27,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesomely badness.

630
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:28,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

631
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:30,786
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

632
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:31,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I want more Japanese games.

633
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:36,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the last set of games that came out, like the real Super Mario Bros.

634
00:36:37,013 --> 00:36:37,613
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 and stuff like that.

635
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,736
[SPEAKER_09]: How are they going to sell Choaniki?

636
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:40,657
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want to know.

637
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:42,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throw it on there.

638
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:43,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Be like, look, it's an import game.

639
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy it.

640
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:46,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

641
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:47,514
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

642
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:16,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course there are some other games other than Earthbound that have been rated as well.

643
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:28,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these including Super Dodgeball, which is not a big surprise since I believe Dodgeball Brawlers is coming out here on the DS pretty soon.

644
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:34,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Samurai Shodown 2, Metal Slug, and Donkey Kong Country 3.

645
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:36,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob?

646
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:37,345
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

647
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,466
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to get Earthbound and you actually should finish it.

648
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:41,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I should.

649
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love Earthbound.

650
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:45,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I just... Because I always rented the game.

651
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:46,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I never actually owned the game.

652
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:50,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I always rented it, and I never just... I always ran out of time to finish it, but I love it.

653
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:55,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're totally like an adult, and you've been one for a long time, so you should go back.

654
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:58,366
[SPEAKER_09]: You're totally like a bitch and you've been one for a long time.

655
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:00,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally going to kick you.

656
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:03,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So you should actually finish games, Rob.

657
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's... Look, I've told the listeners about this before.

658
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:09,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I have gaming ADD.

659
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:13,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I start a game and then another game comes out and I go, Ooh, shiny!

660
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And I throw the other game in a deep dark closet and I start playing the new game.

661
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:18,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And then something else comes out and it's a cycle.

662
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I have total gamer ADD.

663
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:21,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And by new game he means World of Warcraft.

664
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:21,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

665
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:24,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

666
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I go into console mode or whatever.

667
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:39,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, that's kind of sad.

668
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:42,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I've kind of drifted from consoles in the past few years.

669
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to be totally pro-console and sort of anti-PC, but now it's kind of switched.

670
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not anti-console, but I just don't play console games anymore.

671
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,255
[SPEAKER_09]: But the only PC game you're playing is World of Warcraft and Puzzle Pirates, my bad.

672
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:58,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

673
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:01,170
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why World of Warcraft doesn't come out for consoles.

674
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It's keeping PC gaming alive.

675
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,131
[SPEAKER_09]: It is PC gaming.

676
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I shouldn't say that.

677
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get angry emails from PC gamers.

678
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:11,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there obviously is much more, but obviously World of Warcraft is the behemoth.

679
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,674
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't deny that.

680
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:17,856
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are games coming down the turnpike like Spore that are going to be the same thing.

681
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:48,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, basically with, you know, it's kind of like the Xbox 360 and how they emulate the Xbox games.

683
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:51,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, each virtual console game has an emulator built in with it.

684
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:57,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they're basically doing is keeping the emulator in there and then stripping out the ROM and throwing another ROM in there.

685
00:39:58,284 --> 00:40:00,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, it would run off that emulator.

686
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:07,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it works on, they've done it with Pilotwings, 64, Smash Brothers, and, um...

687
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other stuff.

688
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:18,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was thinking, hey, the potential for this, you can Guardian Legends, you could do Super Mario RPG, pretty much anything that's on a virtual console.

689
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:19,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've done it.

690
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:25,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've extracted ROMs or put ROMs from other games that are on other regions into the US ones.

691
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:28,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I think basically just... I don't know.

692
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:36,712
[SPEAKER_04]: What'll happen is you'll see the logo and stuff for whatever game it originally was because they haven't figured out how to change that yet.

693
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

694
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,092
[SPEAKER_04]: with the rate that they're going right now, that won't be long.

695
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:50,500
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just, it's very interesting how much they've, you know, before this was all secure, and now it's just, poof, like, night and day, just cracked completely open.

696
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:58,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'm looking forward to, like, Guardian Legend or something, Blaster Master or something like that on, uh... Do put Blaster Master on my Wii.

697
00:40:58,467 --> 00:40:58,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.

698
00:40:58,827 --> 00:40:59,367
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be awesome.

699
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.

700
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:06,732
[SPEAKER_09]: but are you worried that there's going to be a Nintendo patch that comes out that shuts this whole thing off and possibly bricks consoles that did it?

701
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:29,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they can do that where you brick consoles and the other thing too is it's going to be hard for them to detect this stuff because they can see they can detect what virtual console games you have bought they know that but like if you say for example pirate one of these games and throw it on there it doesn't detect that it's actually on the console it's just data that's on there

702
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:32,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it would be hard for them to do that.

703
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, who's to say that you couldn't buy a legitimate game, like buy Super Mario Bros.

704
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:43,270
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 or something like that, and then go back, delete that, and inject something into the Super Mario Bros.

705
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:43,710
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 file.

706
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So it still looks like you have Super Mario Bros.

707
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,891
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, but it really is like Guardian Legend or something.

708
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:50,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I don't know.

709
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just interesting.

710
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Toshin in chat says, injecting ROMs is lame.

711
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:56,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy the damn virtual console titles, thanks.

712
00:41:57,463 --> 00:41:58,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what if they're not out yet?

713
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,484
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you keep waiting for them and you just don't want to wait?

714
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:04,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And who's to say that you couldn't buy them later on when they actually come out, but now you're playing them?

715
00:42:06,768 --> 00:42:10,090
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see how long it takes Nintendo to cut this off.

716
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says, Mario RPG anyone?

717
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:32,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Toshin says then buy them when they get out so I guess that would be okay moving on to non-virtual console related things and talking about other types of games for the Wii and yes we play Xbox 360 and PS3 too it just so happens there's a lot of Wii news this week Boogie is apparently going to be getting a sequel Boogie Superstar

718
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:34,706
[SPEAKER_09]: has apparently been slated for October.

719
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:39,428
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been spotted on some websites out there for shopping.

720
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:40,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess like game... I don't know.

721
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:44,671
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't say exactly where, but I'm assuming it's either like Gamefly or GameStop or one of those.

722
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,753
[SPEAKER_09]: October 14th is apparently going to be the release date.

723
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:55,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Boogie, the first one, wasn't really that critically heralded, but I guess it did okay out there in the marketplace.

724
00:42:56,036 --> 00:43:00,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine the engine, since it's been built, it's probably not that hard to inject new songs into it.

725
00:43:00,438 --> 00:43:00,718
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

726
00:43:16,621 --> 00:43:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, it won't be long.

727
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:25,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of games like Boogie, completely random tangent, Karaoke Revolution, because I was thinking about games where they don't change a lot from game to game, but the song list.

728
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:27,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke Revolution, right?

729
00:43:27,544 --> 00:43:28,104
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember that game?

730
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:33,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I saw a movie this week, Baby Mama, which was like, you know, I think it was like the number one movie at the box office last week.

731
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it's not anymore, thanks to Iron Man.

732
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:37,407
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, Baby Mama came out.

733
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:40,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke Revolution is like a plot device in the movie.

734
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:40,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

735
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:45,309
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually like a whole scene where they're playing Karaoke Revolution together, and kind of like, I don't want to spoil it, but you know,

736
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:45,769
[SPEAKER_09]: BOOGIE

737
00:44:08,843 --> 00:44:09,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not played Boogie.

738
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:11,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen videos online.

739
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:12,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard from friends about it.

740
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:12,966
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

741
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:17,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually played Boogie at a mutual friend's birthday party.

742
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of... It was okay.

743
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:22,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there was nothing special about it.

744
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:26,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was just like Karaoke Revolution.

745
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:26,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I think...

746
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:55,500
[SPEAKER_07]: there was like something where you can make a music video of it or you can like edit you know the words or something like that like to make it fancy but it's it kind of felt like something that was more palatable to kids or something I don't know I don't know why as a lot of Wii games are yeah but I don't know I just didn't I wasn't thinking like oh this game needs a sequel they should make one you know when I played it so I just think that's kind of weird but whatever I guess it was they got enough money from it so

747
00:44:56,047 --> 00:44:56,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

748
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sequel coming soon.

749
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:07,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something that's a little bit different that's being tested out right now in the Wii Homebrew community is USB mass storage support.

750
00:45:08,177 --> 00:45:17,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just released the source code for USB mass storage device demo, which right now only handles basic error handling and...

751
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:34,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some basic features, but eventually what they're hoping to do with this is allow the USB support from the console to be able to use memory sticks, flash drives, MP3 players, and FAT formatted USB hard drives.

752
00:45:35,055 --> 00:45:53,549
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know very interesting that kind of like what we saw with the PSP where they're adding features to the system that aren't yet available to kind of solve some of the problems with the system and then probably will be added later on by Nintendo type thing.

753
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:59,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like what Sony did with the radio players and stuff like that on their system.

754
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:03,597
[SPEAKER_04]: They went ahead and kind of saw what the homebrew community was doing and followed it up with their own

755
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:05,649
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

756
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:30,413
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good reason.

757
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:36,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also because the way they've got it formatted in blocks, I mean, I guess they could still do that, but it's...

758
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

759
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:40,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just lazy.

760
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:41,312
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

761
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:48,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually just was kind of screwing around one night and I have a little mini SD card in my cell phone and I actually copied a Wii file.

762
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:51,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I copied the Mario Brothers channel just for giggles.

763
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I copied it to my card and it worked.

764
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:55,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't have to format my card for blocks.

765
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:58,026
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mixed in there with pictures I've taken on my cell phone and everything else.

766
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,748
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like I have Mario Brothers in my pocket everywhere I go.

767
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:04,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was just kind of messing around seeing if it would work and it did.

768
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:06,193
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't have to format the card specifically for blocks.

769
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:06,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

770
00:47:06,912 --> 00:47:07,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

771
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:09,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really lazy is what it is.

772
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:27,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

773
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other games that are coming out soon for the Wii.

774
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,704
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have some pretty interesting connectivity.

775
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:35,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Ghostbusters, you know, is coming out soon.

776
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:44,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing, is that Redfly, the development team behind the Wii version of the game, they're also doing the PlayStation 2 version, just so you know.

777
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:49,055
[SPEAKER_09]: In the Wii version, you're actually going to be able to use the DS wirelessly.

778
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:50,716
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't.

779
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:52,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is what's being reported.

780
00:47:52,798 --> 00:47:54,099
[SPEAKER_04]: The DS is a PKE meter.

781
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:54,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

782
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

783
00:47:56,781 --> 00:48:02,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, unfortunately, that was something that was rumored to be happening, and they came out and said, no, that's not going to happen.

784
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:02,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Who said that?

785
00:48:02,906 --> 00:48:04,827
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually came out and said, no, this was a rumor?

786
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:05,367
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.

787
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:07,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, that would have been so awesome, though.

788
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:12,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be an awesome idea, and that's why exactly it wouldn't work, because it would be something smart.

789
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:18,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, they can't do something smart, because that would be wrong.

790
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:24,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess this is all you get then for cool news about the Ghostbusters game and it's kind of borderline cool, I guess.

791
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:28,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Murray's coming back as old as he is to do the Ghostbusters.

792
00:48:29,426 --> 00:48:29,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Lines.

793
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:31,128
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually going to be in the game.

794
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,469
[SPEAKER_09]: He's recording lines for the game.

795
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:33,530
[SPEAKER_09]: So Bill Murray will be in it.

796
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:34,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

797
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:36,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of giving take on Bill Murray.

798
00:48:36,553 --> 00:48:37,173
[SPEAKER_09]: He's okay.

799
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:38,254
[SPEAKER_07]: He is.

800
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:39,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to think he was annoying.

801
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:40,696
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love Rushmore.

802
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you've seen that movie from years ago.

803
00:48:42,938 --> 00:48:44,360
[SPEAKER_09]: He was great in that movie.

804
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,882
[SPEAKER_09]: But Lost in Translation put me to sleep.

805
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:48,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm indifferent on Bill Murray.

806
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:50,125
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

807
00:48:50,413 --> 00:48:53,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, in fact, here's the story here.

808
00:48:53,934 --> 00:49:00,055
[SPEAKER_04]: According to, it's not actually the company that you said, the Red Factor or whatever it is.

809
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a company called Terminal Reality is the one behind it.

810
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:07,456
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I'm sorry to report, unfortunately, this is not a feature of the Wii and DS version of the game.

811
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:09,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been really cool, though.

812
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's from Terminal Reality boss Mark Randall.

813
00:49:12,537 --> 00:49:12,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

814
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:14,758
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be really cool.

815
00:49:15,158 --> 00:49:15,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Fix it!

816
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Delay the game!

817
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:18,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it so.

818
00:49:19,682 --> 00:49:21,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you just say make it so?

819
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.

820
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:35,584
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also that story a long time ago that they were going to do head tracking with boom blocks, but from what I hear and what I kind of gathered, the reason they didn't do that is because Nintendo stopped it.

821
00:49:36,144 --> 00:49:39,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't want people... There was a story.

822
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:44,726
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want people moving a lot in their games because they're worried, I guess, that they're going to get injured or something.

823
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's almost like they won't allow developers to do something innovative unless it's Nintendo's idea type thing.

824
00:49:52,093 --> 00:49:52,554
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

825
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:58,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, we'll roll out the enhancements to your gameplay and then you just follow suit.

826
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking lame.

827
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:02,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

828
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,365
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of goes back to a story that we talked about a couple weeks ago.

829
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:19,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that whole pole dancing Wii game, it's really being worked on.

830
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:20,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It seriously is.

831
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:21,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Peek-a-boo pole dancing.

832
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:25,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if anything I thought was a joke, it was this.

833
00:50:25,778 --> 00:50:27,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of shocking to me.

834
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:38,306
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically a rep for Peekaboo and the licensing agency at AT New Media, Simon K. This is what they have to say.

835
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:42,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Peekaboo will be all about fun and fitness for a new generation.

836
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:48,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Peekaboo wants to make fitness benefits for aerobic pole dancing accessible to millions of Wii users.

837
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:49,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Aerobic pole dancing.

838
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:50,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

839
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:53,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they actually have pole dancing classes you can take?

840
00:50:53,295 --> 00:50:53,875
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.

841
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:57,597
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend tried to do a pole dancing party for her friends.

842
00:50:57,677 --> 00:50:58,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you go?

843
00:50:58,517 --> 00:50:58,737
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

844
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:00,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

845
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,019
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a pole right there.

846
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:01,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

847
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:01,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

848
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:02,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I would play this game.

849
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:21,852
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is to encourage men and women of all shapes and sizes to improve their pole dancing skills while having fun toning up and burning calories.

850
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:27,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, Peekaboo and AT New Media want to do for pole dancing what Guitar Hero did for rock and roll.

851
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:30,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing peekaboo pole dancing.

852
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:44,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

853
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:47,008
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they should put at the Westin.

854
00:51:47,488 --> 00:51:47,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

855
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:48,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

856
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:48,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

857
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my thing with this, okay?

858
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: This is never going to work.

859
00:51:52,211 --> 00:51:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how the hell are they going to implement this?

860
00:51:53,712 --> 00:51:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

861
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:55,733
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really happening.

862
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,614
[SPEAKER_03]: There really, really is going to be a policy.

863
00:51:57,634 --> 00:51:58,595
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really going to do this.

864
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Really.

865
00:51:59,436 --> 00:51:59,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

866
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:00,516
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a joke.

867
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:03,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't said, uh, no.

868
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,164
[SPEAKER_09]: What ever happened to the seal of quality?

869
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:10,467
[SPEAKER_04]: This right here, well, yeah, seriously, what did happen to the seal of quality?

870
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:13,569
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this right here, though, is going to be so bad.

871
00:52:13,649 --> 00:52:27,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, it's not, obviously, it's not going to be a sexual game whatsoever, but the fact that you put, you know, oh, it's a game with a, it's teaching you to be a stripper, you know, that's the spin that they're going to put on this shit.

872
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just...

873
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:38,161
[SPEAKER_09]: there was nothing said about stripping it's aerobic pole dancing there was nothing said about stripping

874
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:41,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I participate in aerobic pole dancing.

875
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I should say my wife participates in aerobic pole dancing.

876
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

877
00:52:44,023 --> 00:52:44,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

878
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot.

879
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:53,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so is it just because they're trying to focus on aerobic games or games that get you moving?

880
00:52:53,985 --> 00:52:54,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bad idea.

881
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:56,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a bad idea.

882
00:52:56,226 --> 00:52:56,526
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

883
00:52:56,626 --> 00:52:58,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

884
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:00,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, how the hell are they going to do this?

885
00:53:00,587 --> 00:53:02,848
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, people are going to, you know...

886
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:10,242
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I gather, this stuff is pretty hard to... I mean, it's not like something you can just go, we're just going to swing around on a pole and stuff.

887
00:53:10,502 --> 00:53:13,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got to be pretty, you know, in shape to do this kind of crap.

888
00:53:13,544 --> 00:53:15,325
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to be falling on their fucking heads.

889
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like the Wii balance board where you just stand there and kind of lean to the side.

890
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:21,768
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like fucking crazy shit.

891
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:22,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

892
00:53:23,149 --> 00:53:24,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it actually going to come with a pole?

893
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to come with a pole.

894
00:53:26,531 --> 00:53:27,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this company...

895
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:31,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a stripper pole that you can buy.

896
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,826
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell them at fucking Spencer's.

897
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:35,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

898
00:53:36,148 --> 00:53:40,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So why do you think... I don't understand how this would work.

899
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:41,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even... Okay.

900
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:43,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Just...

901
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:47,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad idea aside, how the hell are they going to implement this?

902
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:48,657
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was going to ask.

903
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:52,741
[SPEAKER_04]: When are you going to have buttons on this thing or something?

904
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:55,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to sense your movement?

905
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:57,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't seem like it would work.

906
00:53:57,686 --> 00:54:00,690
[SPEAKER_04]: They're throwing a concept out there and like, okay, will someone make this please?

907
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we can't think of a way to do it.

908
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:05,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see them... This is not going to be a...

909
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:07,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

910
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,219
[SPEAKER_04]: People will buy it because it's weird.

911
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

912
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Which will come first, Final Fantasy XIII or peek-a-boo pole dancing?

913
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Peek-a-boo pole dancing.

914
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:27,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So, do you think they chose the Wii console because of the fact that it has a sensor bar and they might incorporate that?

915
00:54:27,822 --> 00:54:30,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's fitness-driven.

916
00:54:30,825 --> 00:54:35,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, the Wii has gotten into a lot of family homes.

917
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:37,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Women are playing the Wii.

918
00:54:39,673 --> 00:54:44,215
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean like housewives, moms, like... Strippers, yeah.

919
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:46,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Strippers, yeah.

920
00:54:46,397 --> 00:54:49,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't think strippers need to play the stripping game, though.

921
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:52,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the, excuse me, aerobic pole dancing game.

922
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you.

923
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,961
[SPEAKER_07]: They do that every night.

924
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:57,663
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't need to go home and take their work home with them or anything.

925
00:54:57,763 --> 00:55:00,444
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't think they're part of the demographic.

926
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:01,665
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, like, you know...

927
00:55:03,687 --> 00:55:08,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Wives who want to do something special for their husband and want to be sexy for their husband.

928
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sweetie, sit down.

929
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do something special for you.

930
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:12,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And they turn on the Wii.

931
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:15,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you're kidding, right?

932
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, most guys would be happy that their wives are playing video games in the first place.

933
00:55:18,855 --> 00:55:20,376
[SPEAKER_09]: But a pole dancing video game?

934
00:55:20,796 --> 00:55:22,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see the positives in that.

935
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:29,635
[SPEAKER_09]: All you have to add to that is her bringing you a beer and cooking your ribs for dinner and you're set.

936
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:30,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's it.

937
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:31,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

938
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:31,998
[SPEAKER_07]: It's perfect.

939
00:55:32,118 --> 00:55:32,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

940
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

941
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... It's like the April Fool's joke that won't die.

942
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:40,047
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

943
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:42,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, these are not a joke.

944
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:44,289
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the upcoming release dates.

945
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's not here tonight, so I'm going to cover Europe for you guys.

946
00:55:47,212 --> 00:55:48,693
[SPEAKER_09]: There's really not a lot anyway.

947
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:53,036
[SPEAKER_09]: On May the 9th, Boom Blox finally makes its way in Europe to the Nintendo Wii.

948
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:57,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming to the Wii, Dragon Quest Swords, the Masked Queen, and the Tower of Mirrors.

949
00:55:57,339 --> 00:56:00,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that whole game where you can actually use the Wii as the sword.

950
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:03,243
[SPEAKER_09]: We played that here, the Japanese version, a long time ago.

951
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:03,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it ever

952
00:56:03,663 --> 00:56:05,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto

953
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:35,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with, well this is not just only on the Wii, but Speed Racer, that's going to be coming out on both the Wii and the DS this week.

954
00:56:36,788 --> 00:56:40,992
[SPEAKER_04]: SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1, coming out on the PSP this week.

955
00:56:42,093 --> 00:56:45,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Baseball Mogul 2009, coming out on the PC.

956
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:51,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here, Chameleon on the PSP, it's kind of like a...

957
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:59,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Brain Voyage, Nintendo Crosswords DS, Dog Island on the Wii,

958
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:13,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoopie Doo.

959
00:57:15,184 --> 00:57:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the cutest Wii game out there.

960
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:21,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you get a bazooka in Dog Island?

961
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:22,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

962
00:57:22,247 --> 00:57:23,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I kid, I kid.

963
00:57:23,747 --> 00:57:26,848
[SPEAKER_04]: But you run around as dogs with giant heads.

964
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:28,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom Blocks, that's coming out on the Wii.

965
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, R-Type Command, it's coming out on the PSP.

966
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:37,032
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some pretty cool pre-order bonus with that too, I think.

967
00:57:38,073 --> 00:57:38,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

968
00:57:39,517 --> 00:58:08,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 4 is getting the game of the year edition finally on Playstation 3 and let's see here I think that's pretty much it oh that's right I thought this was still coming out but I think it may have moved again was it Blastworks supposed to be coming out on the Wii I thought but I think it moved I don't know

969
00:58:11,038 --> 00:58:36,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Blastworks I'm really looking forward to I hope that doesn't suck I would do Japanese release dates about this time but there is seriously nothing coming out in Japan this week at least on the calendar I have the next wave of games is not till the 15th which will be next week you have Luminous Arc 2 on the DS to look forward to next week on the 15th but as far as this week goes you're just going to have to play the games you already have nothing new coming out in Japan

970
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:42,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf 5 o'clock on all games

971
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:05,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, we're not going.

972
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:11,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, Activision and Vividi have discontinued their ESA membership.

973
00:59:15,675 --> 00:59:20,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, kind of going along with that, they are not going to be at E3.

974
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:38,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, according to ESA's Rich Taylor, Senior Vice President of Communications and Research, he says, we can confirm that Activision and Vimvindi Games, I thought it was Activision Blizzard, but, you know, I could be wrong, opted to discontinue their membership.

975
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: The ESA remains dedicated to advancing our industry's objective as protecting intellectual property.

976
00:59:44,316 --> 00:59:51,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Preserving First Amendment rights and fostering a beneficial environment for the entire industry.

977
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:57,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they don't really have that many offensive games or anything, so they don't really need them to defend their rights for anything.

978
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:09,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at the same time, I guess they don't really have to participate in their defending the rights of gamers and the gaming industry because if they're doing it for other people, it still kind of loops them in there.

979
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,686
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like going along for a free ride type thing.

980
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:20,506
[SPEAKER_04]: While the Entertainment Software Association remains the permanent voice for the U.S.

981
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:30,574
[SPEAKER_04]: computer and video game publishers, we can confirm that Activision and Vendee Games opted to discontinue their membership and blah blah blah.

982
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:32,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

983
01:00:33,356 --> 01:00:34,117
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

984
01:00:34,977 --> 01:00:35,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So why'd they do it?

985
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:36,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question of the week.

986
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say.

987
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just being cheap.

988
01:00:40,962 --> 01:00:41,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

989
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:57,292
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a group of companies and you're paying the ESA to defend you from these laws out there that are trying to prevent M-rated games being sold to anybody or calling games porn and stuff like that.

990
01:00:57,852 --> 01:01:05,656
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say drop out of this organization, this organization is still working for other companies to defend them against other things.

991
01:01:05,736 --> 01:01:07,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, now they have less money to work with.

992
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's really the only downside, but they're still fighting for you.

993
01:01:12,762 --> 01:01:13,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you're not paying them.

994
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:19,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You're kind of just sitting there, you know, it's like your friends all chip in for pizza and you're just like, oh, that's cool.

995
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:21,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really hungry right now.

996
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:23,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And later on, you know, oh, there's some pizza leftover.

997
01:01:23,887 --> 01:01:27,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So you start, you know, scoffing down a piece while you're just a freeloader.

998
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:52,402
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah it still affects them regardless of whether they're a member of the ESA or not so they why would they just pay to do that you know and also do they really make any games that would be affected by any kind of law publicity um Activision probably not because I think they mainly just you know Call of Duty 4 is probably the riskiest thing that they have but that's not even really that bad um

999
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:58,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in chat makes the comment a lot of people I've kind of seen have been making this week.

1000
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:00,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw E3, PAX is where it's at.

1001
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:19,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, E3 is kind of beginning its decline, I guess.

1002
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:22,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's nothing special about E3 anymore.

1003
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:24,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody cares about it.

1004
01:02:24,484 --> 01:02:26,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think these companies actually missed the old E3?

1005
01:02:29,326 --> 01:02:30,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It's possible, yeah.

1006
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:38,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, because a lot of the comments I've seen, or theories on it, is they got tired of E3 being kind of a pissing contest of who's flashier, who's...

1007
01:02:42,688 --> 01:02:42,928
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

1008
01:03:03,923 --> 01:03:04,844
[SPEAKER_04]: No press events like that.

1009
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,884
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my thought, exactly.

1010
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:08,066
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole press comes out for Gamers Day.

1011
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:10,327
[SPEAKER_09]: All these Gamers Day stuff.

1012
01:03:10,507 --> 01:03:11,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Why bother doing anything?

1013
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:12,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what I mean.

1014
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:12,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Bastards.

1015
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,270
[SPEAKER_09]: The elite press.

1016
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,912
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't get invited to E3 either, so whatever.

1017
01:03:17,272 --> 01:03:22,355
[SPEAKER_09]: But they get into these things, so why bother with E3?

1018
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:29,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and it doesn't really matter if the press gets to see this stuff anyways, because a lot of times they're just sending them pre-release copies of these games anyways.

1019
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It really...

1020
01:03:32,259 --> 01:03:38,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, press isn't working the way it used to before where people are actually reporting on things.

1021
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:46,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're working closely with these game companies, and the game companies are telling them how to report stuff, and they're going back and forth and making deals and that kind of thing.

1022
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:50,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really all the presses in their pocket type thing nowadays.

1023
01:03:52,304 --> 01:03:53,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Because everybody wants to break exclusives.

1024
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:56,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, everyone wants their exclusives.

1025
01:03:56,786 --> 01:04:03,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And fortunately, as we found out the hard way, that goes to the people that can make the deals.

1026
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:10,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, hey, I'll tell you what, we'll give you premium advertising for your game on our website if we can break this exclusive on the story.

1027
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:17,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will just literally tell you one thing, oh yeah, everyone's going to get the story at the same time.

1028
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:21,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, poof, it gets out there and they're like, oh, well...

1029
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I thought everyone's on the same page about this kind of stuff.

1030
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:31,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, it's just, you know, they follow the money.

1031
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they are business people, so.

1032
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:38,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to see an underground blog come out that just outs all these things.

1033
01:04:39,384 --> 01:04:39,924
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1034
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:42,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the companies buy in.

1035
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,927
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's possible, it might be, I don't know.

1036
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:46,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1037
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:49,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1038
01:04:50,517 --> 01:04:51,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Other comments from chats.

1039
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:53,798
[SPEAKER_09]: ShadowCharlie simply says, fuck E3.

1040
01:04:54,438 --> 01:04:57,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Weedoo says, E3 was a sensation that grew too out of control.

1041
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1042
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:03,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think maybe some people kind of miss the glam that comes with E3 because, boy, that show got a lot of press coverage.

1043
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:05,822
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot, a lot of press coverage.

1044
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And now the toned down one, not quite as much.

1045
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:15,166
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, maybe amongst the hardcore gamers, sure, but amongst the general public, not so much.

1046
01:05:17,607 --> 01:05:17,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1047
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:31,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying, I know they're excuses that we've heard before, we're just like, oh, it's hard for us to make demos and stuff for these events, and it really interferes with our production schedules and stuff like that.

1048
01:05:34,273 --> 01:05:41,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really noticed an issue over the last 10 years or whatever that these have been, probably even longer than these have been going on, so...

1049
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:44,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's just an excuse.

1050
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:52,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just looking at ways to save money because nowadays, I don't know if they're not making as much money or maybe the margins are smaller, but cutting costs any way they can.

1051
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:57,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And a glamorous event like E3, that's definitely an expense that they can probably do without.

1052
01:05:57,947 --> 01:05:58,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what?

1053
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:03,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Activision and Vivendi are not the only ones who have decided to skip E3 this year.

1054
01:06:03,388 --> 01:06:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what makes this story even more interesting.

1055
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:12,410
[SPEAKER_09]: NCSoft, Foundation9, and Atlas have all also opted out of this year's E3.

1056
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,471
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been confirmed by other attendees as well.

1057
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:17,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of interesting.

1058
01:06:19,693 --> 01:06:27,785
[SPEAKER_09]: GameSpot has reported Foundation9 is out because we just didn't feel like we got enough out of the investment last year in order to justify the expense this year.

1059
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:32,231
[SPEAKER_09]: That is telling me, that sounds like a quote where somebody sounds like they missed the old E3.

1060
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:34,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Not getting enough exposure.

1061
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:40,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the old E3 was all about, yes, it was a little bit sensationalistic, but think about all of that exposure.

1062
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:49,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you had people at E3 that may or may not have been there, but they get the word out and they're loving all the stuff they see because it's E3.

1063
01:06:50,124 --> 01:06:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's pumped!

1064
01:06:51,025 --> 01:06:52,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Every game you play is awesome!

1065
01:06:52,686 --> 01:07:06,413
[SPEAKER_04]: What they've changed from years past, they've gotten rid of the Kenshiya Hall, where you had all the independent game companies and stuff down there, where people, after they visit all the other booths and stuff, they just go down there and check out a lot of these games that don't normally get pressed.

1066
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:11,895
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see a lot of stuff down there that's pretty amazing that'll eventually get picked up by a company and stuff.

1067
01:07:12,816 --> 01:07:17,638
[SPEAKER_04]: They would get a lot of foot traffic, a lot more than they would get if they just had a booth at this new E3.

1068
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:17,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Because

1069
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:45,676
[SPEAKER_04]: from what I heard there was you know obviously before there was a lot of traveling in between hotels and stuff like that and a lot of more of a strict schedule so it was a lot less time to kind of explore it at your own pace and that probably also the decreased foot traffic kind of hurt them a little bit because when you have a lot of stories to cover and stuff a lot of the independent media doesn't get to cover these you know smaller companies and that kind of sucks all right well um

1070
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:54,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, some other speculation going on around the internet about exactly why this is all going down this week, which was probably the biggest thing that happened this week.

1071
01:07:55,166 --> 01:08:00,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Kotaku managed to get the organizer of the Penny Arcade Expo to comment on this.

1072
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:06,470
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Robert Koo, who's the director of business development for the Penny Arcade Expo.

1073
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:15,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, the reason that E3 imploded in recent years was because the publishers felt that it turned into this sort of pissing contest between them, where they were trying to figure out who could one-up each other.

1074
01:08:15,994 --> 01:08:18,855
[SPEAKER_09]: They all thought to themselves that it just wasn't worth it.

1075
01:08:21,356 --> 01:08:24,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I would imagine that the show is still trying to look out for what the publishers want.

1076
01:08:24,177 --> 01:08:29,459
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the whole goal of the trade association, which is to deliver the needs and try to figure out what their members actually want.

1077
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,059
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you have it.

1078
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:36,380
[SPEAKER_09]: More speculation as to why E3 may be shrinking.

1079
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,821
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be very interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks.

1080
01:08:40,921 --> 01:08:45,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious if this is going to be the start of a mass exodus or what's going to happen.

1081
01:08:45,442 --> 01:08:48,422
[SPEAKER_04]: You may see that because remember E4ALL?

1082
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:54,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Same kind of thing happened there with big companies saying, nope, we're not going to be a part of this.

1083
01:08:54,024 --> 01:08:55,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft and Sony both pulled out of that, didn't they?

1084
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:56,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so, yeah.

1085
01:08:57,284 --> 01:08:59,265
[SPEAKER_09]: You think these companies might go to E4ALL instead?

1086
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:00,025
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1087
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:01,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they will.

1088
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:02,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they'll do their own.

1089
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:08,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo don't really need these kind of events anyways because they have their own big events.

1090
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:14,336
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, one we'll be talking about in some last minute stories, the PlayStation Day.

1091
01:09:15,356 --> 01:09:21,179
[SPEAKER_04]: They invite the press out for that kind of stuff and I know Microsoft has their own conference and same with Nintendo.

1092
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's really no reason that they need to be a part of E3.

1093
01:09:27,725 --> 01:09:29,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, especially if it's going to cost them a lot more money.

1094
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:34,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they would like the press for it and stuff, but I don't know.

1095
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:39,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I still miss the... I would hate it if they didn't show up because I miss their press conferences.

1096
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:43,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite part, hearing all their cool new things.

1097
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:49,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Nintendo last year was kind of disappointing with those Wii Zapper and Wii Wheel dumb ideas, but whatever.

1098
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:54,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, back on a different subject here.

1099
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:56,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Prince of Persia!

1100
01:09:56,272 --> 01:10:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we talked a little bit a few weeks ago that there was going to be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming out.

1101
01:10:03,498 --> 01:10:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: The brand new game is...

1102
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:13,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's going to be just called Prince of Persia, and not some sort of Prince of Persia prodigy or whatever.

1103
01:10:13,746 --> 01:10:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's scheduled to be released on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

1104
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be a prequel to the previous Prince of Persia series, and I believe it's going to be a trilogy as well.

1105
01:10:27,134 --> 01:10:42,737
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to introduce, I guess, an illustrative art style, and I guess the DS is also getting their own Prince of Persia game, but it's going to be exclusive to that console, and it'll be its own unique storyline.

1106
01:10:43,057 --> 01:10:43,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.

1107
01:10:45,057 --> 01:10:51,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually... I found... I think I found some scans.

1108
01:10:51,138 --> 01:10:54,859
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a magazine... What was it?

1109
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:55,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It was...

1110
01:10:58,434 --> 01:10:59,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Joypad.

1111
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:02,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a magazine that had some pictures.

1112
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:04,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty cool, actually.

1113
01:11:04,777 --> 01:11:10,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost not really cel-shaded, but sort of.

1114
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I would really describe that.

1115
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:16,322
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about this, Rob, here real quick?

1116
01:11:16,382 --> 01:11:20,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll link the chat room to these scans as well.

1117
01:11:20,704 --> 01:11:20,824
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

1118
01:11:23,105 --> 01:11:26,968
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not surprised that Prince of Persia is continuing, especially, you know, they have this movie coming out.

1119
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:31,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little bit surprised they're kind of relaunching it as a, you know, kind of spin-off series or what have you.

1120
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,692
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, if they're going to do that, that's probably why they're trying to change the look of it and everything.

1121
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:35,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So, why not?

1122
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Prince of Persia has always been a solid game.

1123
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:39,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the best way to describe it.

1124
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Prince of Persia series is a very solid line of games.

1125
01:11:41,516 --> 01:11:42,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, what the heck?

1126
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:45,519
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's an interesting art style, I think.

1127
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:47,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, it looks like Okami-ish.

1128
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's the right way to say it.

1129
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:51,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess it would be like a cross between Okami and, say, like...

1130
01:11:53,536 --> 01:11:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, just like a normal action game.

1131
01:11:56,297 --> 01:11:58,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I don't know, it's really hard to describe.

1132
01:11:58,678 --> 01:12:02,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 3D game with, like, ink lines on the outside, I guess.

1133
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'll link it in the chat room.

1134
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:07,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on a website, actiontrip.com.

1135
01:12:09,262 --> 01:12:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1136
01:12:10,423 --> 01:12:12,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other news, Clock Tower.

1137
01:12:12,964 --> 01:12:13,804
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember this game?

1138
01:12:14,244 --> 01:12:16,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Long time ago, it was out on the PlayStation.

1139
01:12:16,905 --> 01:12:18,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you describe what happened in Clock Tower?

1140
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,211
[SPEAKER_07]: You were a girl.

1141
01:12:20,311 --> 01:12:22,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the specifics of it.

1142
01:12:22,193 --> 01:12:26,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess she got locked into a house or something, a mansion.

1143
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:34,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically the objective was for you to hide from this crazy, huge scissor welding guy.

1144
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:39,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would be walking around the house.

1145
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:40,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw this game like one time.

1146
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:41,749
[SPEAKER_07]: This game was a trip from what I remember.

1147
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:42,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It was scary.

1148
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:42,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It is scary.

1149
01:13:06,058 --> 01:13:07,139
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1150
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:22,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait.

1151
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:47,752
[SPEAKER_09]: The folks who produced The Hills Have Eyes 2 are producing this.

1152
01:13:47,832 --> 01:13:48,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know so much about that.

1153
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:52,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Marco Weber and Martin Wise.

1154
01:13:52,655 --> 01:13:56,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like it'll be, at least if nothing else, a good horror film.

1155
01:13:56,217 --> 01:14:00,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want it to be a cheap, cheesy film.

1156
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:04,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it to have some substance in it.

1157
01:14:05,383 --> 01:14:10,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it is a video game movie, I want them to actually do something with it.

1158
01:14:11,474 --> 01:14:11,774
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1159
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:13,135
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens.

1160
01:14:15,155 --> 01:14:23,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because this week was so big with Grand Theft Auto 4, people were wondering, well, where is the PC version of the game?

1161
01:14:23,277 --> 01:14:31,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you may remember with the other ones, it was a while after they came out that the PC version finally made its way to the market.

1162
01:14:33,244 --> 01:14:45,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, of course, Rockstar is, you know, doing the old no comment thing on the Grand Theft Auto 4 PC version, but more than likely it will probably be around at some point.

1163
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: People are hoping that maybe by this holiday we'll see it on the PC.

1164
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:51,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why they wouldn't.

1165
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's more sales for them.

1166
01:14:53,674 --> 01:14:57,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, especially, I imagine the PC version will probably look a little bit better, too.

1167
01:14:58,176 --> 01:14:59,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially on some high-end PCs.

1168
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:00,477
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um,

1169
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:08,554
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some publishers, though, that are still listing the game as being released October 30th, 2008.

1170
01:15:08,694 --> 01:15:20,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, Take-Two or Rockstar has not announced the release of that game or even the existence of the game, so I don't know.

1171
01:15:21,422 --> 01:15:30,408
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's any consolation, though, the last three PC releases for Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas were all pretty quiet, too, so...

1172
01:15:32,984 --> 01:15:33,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's a possibility.

1173
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't know if 3 was on the PC.

1174
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Vice City.

1175
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it?

1176
01:15:38,148 --> 01:15:39,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Vice City was.

1177
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:43,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice City and... Actually, I think 3 may have been on the PC.

1178
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:43,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1179
01:15:44,091 --> 01:15:46,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know Vice City and San Andreas were.

1180
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:52,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, guess what I've got for you guys here before we get to the end of Part A. What's that?

1181
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:56,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's another stupid award for the week.

1182
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:02,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, this week, it's not so gruesome.

1183
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:04,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's actually a good thing, because we don't actually like people dying.

1184
01:16:05,396 --> 01:16:07,676
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is very stupid nonetheless.

1185
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:08,877
[SPEAKER_09]: It happened in San Diego.

1186
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:12,478
[SPEAKER_09]: A 27-year-old robbed a GameStop.

1187
01:16:13,059 --> 01:16:18,641
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually pepper-sprayed two employees and stole launch-date copies of Grand Theft Auto IV.

1188
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:21,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1189
01:16:39,788 --> 01:16:46,794
[SPEAKER_09]: and they found a copy of Grand Theft Auto 3 and a PlayStation 3 controller in his pickup truck along with the stolen copy of Grand Theft Auto 4.

1190
01:16:47,175 --> 01:16:50,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what the police department commented to the local NBC affiliate in San Diego.

1191
01:16:51,198 --> 01:17:03,709
[SPEAKER_09]: The call came out as a robbery of a commercial business and the suspect was described and the vehicle truck that he got into was described as a white Toyota pickup truck lifted with the tailgate down and our helicopter Abel spotted the vehicle southbound.

1192
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,371
[SPEAKER_09]: The officers followed it.

1193
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that was it.

1194
01:17:10,601 --> 01:17:19,549
[SPEAKER_09]: No word on how many stars he accumulated in the heist.

1195
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:23,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Comment from chat, Alpha Canogram says, I bet Lord Voldemort paid that dude to do it.

1196
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:28,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Lord Voldemort is our other name for you-know-who.

1197
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Tack Johnson.

1198
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably paid him to do it.

1199
01:17:34,802 --> 01:17:35,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow...

1200
01:17:36,596 --> 01:17:38,938
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to steal a game, well, you just shouldn't steal a game.

1201
01:17:39,018 --> 01:17:39,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Stealing games is stupid.

1202
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially, I mean, he stole one game.

1203
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:45,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're going to steal more.

1204
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:48,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just funny.

1205
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:49,985
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you shouldn't steal at all.

1206
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very bad when you steal.

1207
01:17:51,906 --> 01:17:57,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're going to get somebody on the line here to do something special for you here at the very, very end of part A of our podcast.

1208
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:01,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know what happens at the end of part A of our show all the time.

1209
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:05,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Two ringy dingies.

1210
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:07,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Jamie.

1211
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:09,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1212
01:18:09,571 --> 01:18:12,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's Rob, Orange Lounge.

1213
01:18:12,293 --> 01:18:13,613
[SPEAKER_09]: The show misses you tonight.

1214
01:18:13,673 --> 01:18:14,194
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

1215
01:18:16,355 --> 01:18:16,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dead.

1216
01:18:17,215 --> 01:18:17,675
[SPEAKER_09]: You're dead?

1217
01:18:18,536 --> 01:18:19,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to hear that.

1218
01:18:19,356 --> 01:18:20,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the guy from Clock Tower kill you?

1219
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:23,378
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1220
01:18:23,438 --> 01:18:27,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved a lot of furniture yesterday and then ran errands all day and then drove back.

1221
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:33,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, you know, we're at the end of Part A, finally.

1222
01:18:33,551 --> 01:18:36,011
[SPEAKER_09]: We surprisingly ran long tonight with not much gaming news.

1223
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:44,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, there's always a segment that we do at this part of the show, so we had to bring you here to give us your Classic Game of the Week!

1224
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:55,575
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your part of the show where we pay respect to our elders in gaming, with Jamie picking out a game from the long-lost archives of games that folks should really check out this week.

1225
01:18:55,615 --> 01:18:57,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Jamie, what did you pick for the kids tonight?

1226
01:18:58,874 --> 01:19:02,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked out nothing that was obscure or crazy or weird or anything.

1227
01:19:03,303 --> 01:19:04,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked out Super Mario Bros. 3.

1228
01:19:10,563 --> 01:19:13,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, um, it's actually one of my favorite games.

1229
01:19:13,484 --> 01:19:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: When it came out, I went, like, completely crazy.

1230
01:19:15,644 --> 01:19:18,345
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the only reason that I would see The Wizard to begin with.

1231
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:19,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1232
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, the game, you know, it was, it took, because, you know, what Super Mario Bros.

1233
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:28,387
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 was over here wasn't really Super Mario Bros.

1234
01:19:28,407 --> 01:19:28,387
2.

1235
01:19:28,447 --> 01:19:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Bros.

1236
01:19:29,528 --> 01:19:38,870
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 was more like a, the original was more like a rehash of the first game, whereas 3 actually did some real innovations, um, by having your different worlds and

1237
01:19:39,827 --> 01:19:40,808
[SPEAKER_05]: different things like that.

1238
01:19:42,629 --> 01:19:49,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, the whole point of it is, uh... Okay, I didn't mean to read through my thoughts.

1239
01:19:49,735 --> 01:19:57,921
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole point was that it's still that formula that everyone had become accustomed to, and then just blew it up really big.

1240
01:19:58,081 --> 01:19:59,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was really cool.

1241
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:01,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you had eight different worlds.

1242
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:05,847
[SPEAKER_05]: You had, um, World 1, which is grassland, World 2 is desert, uh...

1243
01:20:06,634 --> 01:20:16,739
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 was Seaside, 4 was Big Island, 5 was The Sky, 6 was Iceland, 7 was Titanase, and 8 was Castle Koopa.

1244
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:33,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, you know, each world had, you know, different maps that would go along with the theme of whatever that world was, but you also had different, um, little mini-fortresses that you had to go to, and then you had your primary boss, which was

1245
01:20:34,221 --> 01:20:41,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the bosses were all pretty easy if you just keep stomping on their heads repeatedly and don't let them get any moves on you.

1246
01:20:41,205 --> 01:20:41,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's true.

1247
01:20:41,726 --> 01:20:42,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

1248
01:20:42,686 --> 01:20:42,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1249
01:21:07,455 --> 01:21:12,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best-selling that was not originally packaged with the system.

1250
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, because obviously you have Super Mario Bros.

1251
01:21:33,843 --> 01:21:35,504
[SPEAKER_09]: as the pack, and of course that's going to sell more.

1252
01:21:35,764 --> 01:21:36,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Technicality.

1253
01:21:37,485 --> 01:21:40,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember this game for being featured in the movie The Wizard.

1254
01:21:41,628 --> 01:21:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what I had mentioned.

1255
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:46,111
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only reason I saw that movie to begin with.

1256
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:53,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was the motivation for a lot of us, was to see the first sneak peek at Super Mario Bros.

1257
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:53,096
3!

1258
01:21:53,196 --> 01:21:55,217
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?

1259
01:21:55,337 --> 01:21:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1260
01:21:55,798 --> 01:21:57,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the guy introducing it in the movie?

1261
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:58,359
[SPEAKER_09]: He made it sound all like holy.

1262
01:21:58,379 --> 01:21:59,220
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

1263
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:01,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're like, uh, yay?

1264
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:07,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, well, the other thing that I thought was really cool about the game was the different, um, power-ups that you would get.

1265
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:18,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you had your usual mushroom, you had your fire flower, but you also had, um, the, uh, raccoon tail that you could get.

1266
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:20,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That was always, like, my favorite to have ever.

1267
01:22:20,951 --> 01:22:26,476
[SPEAKER_05]: You had your, you know, your power stars, and you had, um, you know, all your other mushrooms.

1268
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:37,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the tanuki suit was fantastic, because you could also turn into, um, the monk statue, and the enemy would just ignore you for a little bit, except you really couldn't do that on the donut level.

1269
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:41,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean by the donut level, where you'd run over the little donuts, and they would fall?

1270
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,312
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't do it on that level, because you'd die.

1271
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:49,677
[SPEAKER_05]: The other cool thing about the tanuki suit is if you turn into the statue while you're airborne, you'll land on something, and it'll kill it, and it's great.

1272
01:22:51,098 --> 01:22:56,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you also get the p-wing, which was, there's actually two items, there's a p-wing or an anchor,

1273
01:22:57,023 --> 01:23:00,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, you get those out of some of the toad houses.

1274
01:23:00,826 --> 01:23:07,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, if you collect a certain number of coins on even number worlds, you would get the anchor.

1275
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:13,174
[SPEAKER_05]: If you did it on the odd worlds, then you would get, um, a, uh, T-Wing.

1276
01:23:13,854 --> 01:23:14,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it's the other way around.

1277
01:23:14,975 --> 01:23:15,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1278
01:23:16,235 --> 01:23:17,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it was that way.

1279
01:23:17,396 --> 01:23:22,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also on, um, a couple of the places you could get a Hammer Brother suit, so you could go hammer.

1280
01:23:24,141 --> 01:23:24,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um,

1281
01:23:25,356 --> 01:23:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one fire brother that would, um, let you, uh... I'm being scared out by my husband.

1282
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,381
[SPEAKER_05]: The anchor was worthless.

1283
01:23:34,562 --> 01:23:35,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan says the anchor was worthless.

1284
01:23:35,942 --> 01:23:37,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Hammer brothers shoot rocks.

1285
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:39,204
[SPEAKER_09]: The anchor was worthless.

1286
01:23:39,224 --> 01:23:39,505
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1287
01:23:39,605 --> 01:23:40,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I will tell you, though.

1288
01:23:40,305 --> 01:23:42,386
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what pissed me off about power-ups, Jamie?

1289
01:23:42,987 --> 01:23:43,807
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one more.

1290
01:23:44,027 --> 01:23:44,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, go ahead.

1291
01:23:45,828 --> 01:23:47,369
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the Kuriko shoe.

1292
01:23:47,549 --> 01:23:48,470
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was gonna say.

1293
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:53,013
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, not just the fact that it was there, but what pissed me off, you could only use that damn shoe in one level.

1294
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1295
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the best level in the whole game.

1296
01:23:58,111 --> 01:23:58,431
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1297
01:23:58,451 --> 01:23:59,791
[SPEAKER_09]: They should make... Go ahead.

1298
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:03,352
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also Warp Whistles, too, that made the Zelda noise.

1299
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:06,813
[SPEAKER_09]: They should make a game for the Wii called Kuriboh Shoe.

1300
01:24:07,093 --> 01:24:07,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody would buy it.

1301
01:24:09,454 --> 01:24:10,234
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

1302
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:14,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there were some differences in the levels between the American and Japanese version.

1303
01:24:15,835 --> 01:24:20,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Some were changed for matters of just... It caused the game to glitch.

1304
01:24:21,677 --> 01:24:21,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

1305
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:34,257
[SPEAKER_05]: In World 5, there was, in 5.1, you would have to go to a pipe to get to where the screen goes black and white, and it would actually cause the game to glitch up pretty bad.

1306
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:39,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you got hit in the Japanese version, no matter what power you had, you would go back to being small.

1307
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:45,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in the American one, you would just go to being super and then to being small.

1308
01:24:46,227 --> 01:24:51,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Except with the Crudyville shoot, which was, you'd go back to being small in the Japanese version,

1309
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:56,944
[SPEAKER_05]: But in American One, you just go back to whatever power-up you had, then to Super, and then to Small.

1310
01:24:57,624 --> 01:25:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and the music for the game was done by, um, uh, Koji Kondo, who I got to meet.

1311
01:25:04,788 --> 01:25:07,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um... He's the guy.

1312
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:07,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1313
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, there were remakes.

1314
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:14,413
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the, um, Catella View version for Super Famicom.

1315
01:25:15,434 --> 01:25:15,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1316
01:25:16,477 --> 01:25:21,798
[SPEAKER_05]: This was basically the enhanced version that looked like Super Mario All-Stars, which, again, was another version.

1317
01:25:22,519 --> 01:25:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, Super Mario All-Stars had the version that came out actually retained some of the stuff that was in the Japanese version and not in the US one.

1318
01:25:31,281 --> 01:25:40,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We also got Super Mario Advance 4, Super Mario 3, which was pretty cool and had stuff added and, you know, tried to spice it up a little bit.

1319
01:25:41,187 --> 01:25:43,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was developed by Nintendo R&D 2.

1320
01:25:43,488 --> 01:25:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

1321
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:53,731
[SPEAKER_05]: There were e-reader extra levels that would extend the game, but they were really convoluted and hard to do, so it was like, people just said, ah, screw it, and didn't bother.

1322
01:25:53,992 --> 01:25:55,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even remember that.

1323
01:25:56,232 --> 01:25:57,833
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Super Mario Bros.

1324
01:25:57,893 --> 01:26:05,396
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D, the Walmart cards, and some that came with the game, with Super Mario Advance 4.

1325
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:08,917
[SPEAKER_05]: The extensions were for the Advance version.

1326
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:34,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but you had to have the e-reader, two DBAs, a link cable, and the card you wanted, and you would hook up the DBA with the cartridge, um, and the, the connector would go in the e-reader, and then you would do all this convoluted crap, and it was a big pain in the ass, and not, I mean, the levels were cool, and it really opened up, I think, a lot of potential to

1327
01:26:35,905 --> 01:26:42,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I had almost infinite playability as long as people were willing to put up with the crap you had to do to use the e-reader.

1328
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:50,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, the whole e-reader thing sort of died out once they started upgrading the hardware.

1329
01:26:52,033 --> 01:26:55,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting comment from Ranma in chat.

1330
01:26:55,814 --> 01:26:57,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo, give us Super Mario Bros.

1331
01:26:58,274 --> 01:26:57,814
4.

1332
01:26:58,695 --> 01:27:01,895
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we never really have had just a plain Super Mario Bros.

1333
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:03,236
[SPEAKER_09]: game since Super Mario Bros.

1334
01:27:03,256 --> 01:27:03,236
3.

1335
01:27:03,276 --> 01:27:08,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sure, there's been Mario World, there's been countless other games that have had Mario in it, but there's never ever been a Super Mario Bros.

1336
01:27:09,017 --> 01:27:08,997
4.

1337
01:27:10,197 --> 01:27:12,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that World was technically 4.

1338
01:27:13,778 --> 01:27:18,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so, but it was also, you know... Because it still followed the same platform...

1339
01:27:19,816 --> 01:27:24,700
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, format, it was, it was, I look at it as a direct successor to 3.

1340
01:27:26,101 --> 01:27:26,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1341
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:30,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Even down to the world, down to power-ups, down to all the specials.

1342
01:27:31,765 --> 01:27:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and actually, if I do remember right, I think that the Super Mario World feather was actually the power-up in, um, uh, you could use that as a power-up in Mario 4 Advance.

1343
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:42,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

1344
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:52,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that Worlds could be considered... I think it's just that they decided to stop numbering them because it would get ridiculous and then fall into Street Fighter formula.

1345
01:27:52,714 --> 01:27:53,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was... Oh, yeah.

1346
01:27:53,175 --> 01:27:54,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I was talking about Mario Advance 1 before.

1347
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:55,916
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, we did have that, I guess.

1348
01:28:11,101 --> 01:28:13,823
[SPEAKER_05]: and me and the Mario and we had Lost Levels.

1349
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:15,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Lost Levels, but the All-Stars.

1350
01:28:16,644 --> 01:28:17,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1351
01:28:17,364 --> 01:28:19,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any other thoughts on Super Mario Bros.

1352
01:28:19,486 --> 01:28:19,466
3?

1353
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:31,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun and I'm going to break out my top-loading Nintendo soon and play the hell out of it when I don't feel like I'm going to fall over and die.

1354
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:33,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't use whistles because you know that's cheating.

1355
01:28:34,266 --> 01:28:35,266
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not cheating.

1356
01:28:35,286 --> 01:28:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1357
01:28:37,307 --> 01:28:41,869
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to have a discussion right here, right now about using the warp whistle.

1358
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:43,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not cheating.

1359
01:28:43,509 --> 01:28:44,930
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in there for a reason.

1360
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They were programmed into the game.

1361
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:48,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not cheating.

1362
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:51,833
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've got to admit, it's so much more fun to play without warping.

1363
01:28:53,933 --> 01:28:54,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Says you.

1364
01:28:54,834 --> 01:28:57,095
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get to play Big World if you warp.

1365
01:28:57,175 --> 01:28:59,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Big World is the bomb.

1366
01:28:59,275 --> 01:29:00,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Big World was the best.

1367
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:01,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.

1368
01:29:01,076 --> 01:29:03,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can warp to get ahead, to get right to Big World, you know.

1369
01:29:04,281 --> 01:29:05,062
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go right there.

1370
01:29:05,182 --> 01:29:06,022
[SPEAKER_09]: That's only half cheating.

1371
01:29:07,563 --> 01:29:08,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not cheating at all.

1372
01:29:09,405 --> 01:29:11,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, okay, okay.

1373
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:14,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It was programmed into the game for a reason.

1374
01:29:14,569 --> 01:29:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

1375
01:29:15,229 --> 01:29:15,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1376
01:29:15,669 --> 01:29:20,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the same argument with people who would say, oh, you can't use speed-ups on DDR either.

1377
01:29:21,133 --> 01:29:25,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay, go back and play Beat Mania without, you know, speed-ups.

1378
01:29:26,457 --> 01:29:27,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't in the original.

1379
01:29:27,438 --> 01:29:28,459
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fine.

1380
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:29,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Warp all you want.

1381
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,540
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want Big World.

1382
01:29:31,521 --> 01:29:32,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And the level with Kuriboh Shu.

1383
01:29:33,254 --> 01:29:34,194
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll program more.

1384
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:34,715
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1385
01:29:36,516 --> 01:29:40,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, we've got to wrap up Part A so we can get to Part B or we'll be here all night.

1386
01:29:40,258 --> 01:29:40,538
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1387
01:29:40,778 --> 01:29:44,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other quick things you wanted to share with the listeners before you're back here next week?

1388
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:49,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like sushi.

1389
01:29:49,682 --> 01:29:50,023
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1390
01:29:50,723 --> 01:29:51,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy your sushi.

1391
01:29:51,443 --> 01:29:52,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I had good sushi for lunch.

1392
01:29:52,764 --> 01:29:53,064
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1393
01:29:53,184 --> 01:29:53,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Burp.

1394
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:54,165
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1395
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:55,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Jamie.

1396
01:29:56,926 --> 01:29:57,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1397
01:29:57,346 --> 01:29:58,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, Jamie.

1398
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:03,703
[SPEAKER_09]: For being tired, she sounds like she has a lot of energy left in her.

1399
01:30:03,743 --> 01:30:05,324
[SPEAKER_09]: She talked for 10 minutes about Mario Bros.

1400
01:30:05,644 --> 01:30:05,324
3.

1401
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:08,726
[SPEAKER_07]: She's very passionate about that game.

1402
01:30:08,846 --> 01:30:11,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It is probably one of the best games of all time.

1403
01:30:11,567 --> 01:30:12,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can't deny that.

1404
01:30:12,948 --> 01:30:13,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I absolutely cannot.

1405
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:21,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if there is any classic game, I mean, just because y'all happen to have probably played this one doesn't make it a non-classic game.

1406
01:30:21,191 --> 01:30:22,872
[SPEAKER_09]: It had to be the classic game of the week at some point.

1407
01:30:23,112 --> 01:30:23,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.

1408
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:24,133
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1409
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:28,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well that's going to do it for part A of our show.

1410
01:30:28,894 --> 01:30:31,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So those of you guys listening on the podcast, we'll be back in a few days.

1411
01:30:31,935 --> 01:30:38,036
[SPEAKER_09]: But for those of you guys listening live tonight on www.allgames.com, we'll be back in a few minutes with part B of our show.
