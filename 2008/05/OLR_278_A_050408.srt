mustard all over me yes mustard what in the hell this show is completely

25

disorganized tonight what you delicious mustard I don't know first the mics are

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,240
tangled in the problem is because she's sitting over here instead of sitting

stupid thing around the chair I want to get her scoot back we want to get her

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,880
pretty little face on cam even though the cam is kind of sucking tonight sorry

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,400
there all right how you doing I'm fine all right now except that mustard on me

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,800
how was your week outside of the goddamn mustard it was okay I went to Vegas how

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,480
was Vegas you went there for some type of like gaming demo or something right

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,840
yeah we went there too I don't know what you would really call I guess the gaming

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,400
expo we were the expo what's a Zappos you may remember them of the shoes and

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
apparel website they have like commercials now on TV and stuff so we

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,560
went there we got the tour and then we demoed games there which I got to play

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,080
you know quite a few of them because that's what I was doing is playing games

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,600
and basically you know just kind of teaching them the basics about games and

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,400
stuff just throwing some like facts out there for him basically just to get him

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,920
excited about games it was cool though they had a DDR supernova machine there

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,400
so I got to play that for a little bit and then what else did we play there we

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,080
had a Gran Turismo 5 prologue setup which I mean that game looks good but

43
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,220
you know I just never was really interested in the Gran Turismo series

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,080
but pretty I'll give them that and got to use the nice dual shocks and stuff so

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:54,240
all the rumbles which you know I guess that's neat then we also had set up

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,840
Mario Kart Wii so I finally used the Wii wheel instead of just you know

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,240
hooking it out the door be honest there's really hardly any difference

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
between the Wii wheel and just holding the controller sideways and I hate it I

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,840
absolutely hate it but we played you know that for a while and then I tried

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,200
also they had a well Halo 3 set up so I was playing a little bit of a death

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,200
match there that was fun Call of Duty 4 which I've played that before and that

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,480
looks nice we had Grand Theft Auto 4 set up because I brought my copy actually

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,040
with me I actually brought my 360 with me ironically enough that I didn't get

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,120
chance to actually play it in my hotel room at all so that kind of sucked but I

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,520
did play it at the event and I had already memorized a lot of the cheat

56
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
codes so I was just spawning helicopters and chopping people with the rotor

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
blades and stuff and just fun stuff like that and people seem to enjoy it then we

58
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,400
had Wii Sports being demoed you know pretty much everything from that and

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,280
Smash Brothers once again I had to play with it you know the controller sideways

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,520
which I hate it and I think that's it so that's what we were demoing for them and

61
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,360
they really enjoyed it and it's a great company to be honest I'd work there

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,840
tomorrow if I could but you know they're all the way in Henderson Nevada and we're

63
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,160
all the way out here in Sacramento but shit man if they were out here absolutely

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,040
awesome company just everyone loved working there they cater lunch and

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,360
breakfast every day they have vending machines full of stuff that's all free

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,520
just very fun going you know environment well since you were getting into your

67
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,120
gaming week why don't you tell us a little more about what other types of

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,480
games you've been playing this week anything outside of Vegas yes well more

69
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,840
Grand Theft Auto 4 we finally got our internet open at work so now we can

70
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
start doing the death matches online which is awesome very looking forward to

71
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,400
that I played a five minute death match with one of my co-workers and it was fun

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,240
it's pretty hard to spot people especially even with all the

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,560
pedestrians raining around because you know you do see their name above their

74
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,400
head and stuff but sometimes it's hard to spot on me amongst all the pedestrians

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,120
so that's pretty cool and then today we just kind of play the like a fuck-off

76
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,760
game you know it's a free play thing and that was fun it played that for about I

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,840
think a good half hour 45 minutes and just you know flying around helicopters

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,400
and just you know fucking around running for the police it was really fun it

79
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,800
really I really want to get more into the multiplayer in this game that's for

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,040
sure in the single-player version of the game is pretty fun too I've been doing

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,320
more of the missions and stuff and kind of along in the stories starting to you

82
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,040
know come around a bit so I'm very you know looking forward to this game a lot

83
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,760
I'm just worried though that because even like flying to the different

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,240
islands and stuff it's like okay now I've seen everything and you know I

85
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,680
don't know but I think it's still very confusing stuff driving around you don't

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,080
you know it's hard to orient yourself a little bit more than say the other games

87
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,000
because there's a lot less than those other games but it's a good game

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,880
definitely a good game and see what else they play Oh crisis core played that a

89
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,320
little bit on the plane I really can't get in that game very much it's too

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,080
linear just really because people have just been like you know swooning all

91
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,480
about crisis core some kind of surprise it's very linear I mean if you don't get

92
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,320
a lot of place I mean you can go explore a little bit but it's very empty I don't

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,680
know it's just I maybe I'm not that far into the game maybe not far enough to

94
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,360
where the game just shifts to where you can run around anywhere and do whatever

95
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,040
but it's just very linear and just empty even more so than like the other but

96
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,200
that's kind of typical for like a PSP game though they're usually very sparse

97
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,680
because they can't handle them any polygons on the screen stuff but that

98
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,400
might be the first negative thing I've heard about crisis core it's just I

99
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,680
can't get into it I want to get into it because it looks really cool but we got

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,160
to get to the chat room for comments chat orange lounge radio.com if you want

101

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,320
comment tonight from act theft he says more like crisis bore that is that what

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,840
it is then I mean I actually instead of playing the game on my you know flight

105
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,640
back I decided to read the sky mall magazine that gives you an idea I chose

106
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,200
the sky ball magazine over crisis core sky ball has some pretty sweet stuff and

107
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,520
they do have some pretty interesting things in there they had some things I

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,760
was like hey that's a pretty cool idea good times anything else um I played

109
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,880
something else oh I was playing this web flash game it's for Castle Crashers but

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,440
you're fighting a guy with a beard what is a giant head with a beard wait it's

111
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
it's a demo for Castle Crashers no it's like a flash game that the guy that

112
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,000
created Castle Crashers made with the character okay also Crashers and you're

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,680
fighting the guy the beard interesting it I can't remember the name of it I'll

114
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,040
find it but uh it was interesting all righty I never say this name right I

115
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,720
apologize this poor guy oh we too says Loki is reviewing a game but nothing

116
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,600
compares to his beloved Grand Theft Auto 4 is that true I mean it's good I just

117
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
enjoyed a lot more I don't know it's not I'm not seeing that it's better than any

118
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
game out there it's just I'm enjoying it a lot more right now I mean what's he

119
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,960
throw to comes out who knows I mean awesome that probably awesome for

120
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,040
completely disagrees with you says crisis core is the downright best game

121
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,280
on the PSP I don't know about that all right what would you say is the best

122
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,720
game on the PSP out of can I see played so far yeah you know I'd probably have

123
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,560
to say grant that thought of I knew it I knew it just just because I played a lot

124
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,880
of that game it's just it's fun but you know I don't know if they put like Final

125
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,520
Fantasy 7 like the actual 7 on there I would probably say that would be pretty

126
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,840
fun and Final Fantasy 1 on the PSP was pretty fun so I don't know just maybe

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,240
some more of the retro games I guess I like stuff well I'll say like I liked

128
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Space Invaders extreme I really like that game but that game did seem like a lot

129
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,080
of fun with the few minutes I played the one you had any of I that's something

130
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,560
they need to bring to live in like the PlayStation Network seriously that would

131
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,200
do so well for them but Space Invaders extreme by the way like if you like

132
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,200
those like music Gucci games like resin stuff or every extend extra like mix

133
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,080
that with Space Invaders that's what Space Invaders extreme is it's pretty

134
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,920
hot because I am a huge like Loki is to Grand Theft Auto I love music Gucci like

135
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,400
I everything he touches I will do felt like I even defended 99 nights okay like

136
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,440
I'll admit it wait what you say that I don't even know what that 99 nights came

137
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,160
out of the Xbox 360 and it was kind of the what's the game is just like thank

138
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,920
you dynasty warriors but it had its issues but I came on the show and I was

139
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:07,320
like it's not a bad game it just needs a little work so we all have our things we

140
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,880
get fanboy over what do you get fanboy over rice princess or fangirl I don't

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,720
really have anything currently that I get all like mmm over anymore just the

142
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,040
typical like Nintendo franchises what about Chrono Trigger oh okay cuz I seem

143
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,560
to remember a few weeks ago on this program I took a lot of heat for not

144
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,600
declaring okay Chrono Trigger is great didn't care too much about Chrono Cross

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,280
didn't wasn't really impressed by that Chrono Trigger remake they were doing

146
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,400
the 3d one what okay that's not a 3d child I am like strictly a 2d type of

147
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,800
person all right that's why I didn't care for it but yeah I'm kind of a

148
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,240
boring person when it comes you like your games very two-dimensional and

149
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,560
vanilla totally yeah what about the 2d games with that 3d kind of look to them

150
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,000
like I don't know beautiful Joe kind of that's see that's cool with me and it's

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,400
not okay it's it's case by case it's not strictly I won't play any 3d games I

152
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,900
play 3d games it's just my preference I feel that they put more effort into the

153
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,320
game when it's 2d because they're not focusing on trying to make it look all

154
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,520
cool because it's 3d I don't know I just Super Nintendo forever comments from

155
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,480
chat siren says and I'm probably another name I'm mispronouncing but you know

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,440
what I do that I'm mispronouncing it's amateur radio says Chrono Trigger equals

157
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,240
not that great oh you equals not that great

158
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,360
awesome first says 99 nights I remember being reviewed on x-play with a girl

159
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,560
screaming horribly I remember watching x-play and I was screaming horribly

160
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,400
you're such a dork all right well how was your gaming way what kind of games

161
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
have you been playing this week I'm assuming Loki's done if he's not I cut

162
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,960
him off what how was your gaming week I'm done boring I played Wow and I

163
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:58,160
started playing puzzle pirates again nerd okay if for whatever reason let's

164
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,160
say a listener the show has never heard of puzzle pirates before is it a free

165
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,720
MMO okay it went from beta to charge and now they have kind of this system where

166
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
you can play for free and then like buy certain aspects of the game with real

167
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,320
money like if you want to have Johnny Depp hair you got a yeah exactly yeah

168
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,120
like clothes or an island or something like that you can pay for it but

169
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,920
essentially it's just a big puzzle game if you've ever played something like

170
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,660
puzzle quest or something it's kind of sort of like that but in a pirate

171
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,000
setting you sail the ship by playing a puzzle you build the stations you do

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,920
carpentry all that crap you know but they're all like pop cap games basically

173
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,880
because building is like bejeweled right yeah yeah it's pretty much like one of

174
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,600
them was like dr. Mario yeah I think it was a sailing one yeah yeah but yeah

175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,640
it's basically what it is but it's fun and it's addictive and like it is like

176
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,560
it's like pop cap the MMO with pirates exactly that is exactly what it is

177
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,280
that's a great description so but it's really fun and I like have been spending

178
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,080
countless hours playing I know a few people have really gotten sucked into

179
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,800
puzzle pirates yeah a few people on my live journal on the friends list they

180
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,160
just always talk about you know puzzle pirates it's good time it's like Wow for

181
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,600
the puzzle crowd I guess you could say all right yeah pretty cool my gaming

182
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,960
week I must be I feel like the one person on the planet who has not been

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,640
all getting into Grand Theft Auto 4 here's my thing I like I respect let me

184
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,640
put this I respect Grand Theft Auto 4 I think it is a good game but it's just

185
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,920
not kind of like my thing like I have this big concern I'm gonna spend $60 in

186
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,080
this game and I don't really play Grand Theft Auto for the story because I'm

187
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,440
just not into those types of stories and I think I would have a lot of fun

188
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,120
running around for like three hours and blowing everything up I possibly can and

189
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
shooting people in the face but then I think it would kind of get old for me

190
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
but I don't know the online modes make me think maybe I'd have a little more

191
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,960
fun with it so I'm still kind of on the fence I want to wait for the game to

192
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,920
come down in price but we all know that's not gonna happen for a long long

193
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,720
time long time but you see long time you say that about it but I mean it's kind

194
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,040
of like Wow you do the exact same thing over and over there's something more Wow

195
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,440
has a chat room I can't explain it yeah I guess that's a good point but I mean

196
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,040
I've always said game Wow Wow is a giant chat room with spells like basically you

197
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,000
know kind of true but I mean like there is gonna be the you know there's the

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,600
online element to it and I don't know you would just I think if you pick it up

199
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,160
and play it you might get more into it than you actually think you would Rob

200
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,520
it's just me there well J rod says why doesn't sky just borrow it from Loki

201
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,800
does he keep it in a fireproof safe guarded by pit bulls or something no I

202
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,400
think it's not a fireproof safe it's the safety deposit box that came with my you

203
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,800
know my special edition plus I would I would think that Loki just wants to hang

204
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,480
on to it for a little while he'll probably let me borrow it in like six

205
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,160
weeks well I can't let you borrow because I have to use it at work when we

206
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,760
play our weekly death match early death matches so I mean I have four copies of

207
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,440
the game right now you gotta let that Loki has four copies of the game and he

208
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,520
won't let me borrow one five we have five people that want to play it at work

209
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,160
and in fact I need to get another copy of it it's fine it's fine like I said I

210
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,800
will buy it eventually I don't know when that's going to be he's only got four

211
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,920
copies Rob I will find you one shit God it's all good don't worry about it I

212
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,960

261
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,840
alone you that one how nice alright what I did want to play for you guys as I

262
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,880
promised last week I said we got a really great entry from somebody who

263
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,520
unfortunately is ineligible because for reasons beyond our control namely the

264
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,800
fact that the limited edition console that is the grand prize only works in

265
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,880
the United States or North American regions I should say Canada Mexico are

266
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,920
fine but it will not work in Europe okay we had to say you know North American

267
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,760
residents only so unfortunately this guy was ineligible but I think the commercial

268
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,000
is so damn funny I want you guys to hear it so this is Martin from Belgium and

269
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,760
this is his entry for the contest that unfortunately is ineligible we wanted to

270
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,240
play it on the show because it's so great introducing Loki's world of

271
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,680
randomness do you have no free time are you tired of raising your children are

272
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,640
your children little pussies getting beat up just drop them in front of the

273
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,600
TV with Loki's world of randomness run around a virtual world in a bingle

274
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,240
outfit while performing random acts it will teach your children important

275
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:11,480
skills such as how to attach a laser to their pet cat disembodied heads how to

276
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,400
take pictures of guys kissing or how to shout fuck a combination of all of the

277
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,040
above if your children suffer mental damage from playing this game or start

278
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,560
killing their friends with their laser cats it may result in a bonus lawsuit

279
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,920
settlement from our legal department this game is approved by wappy play.com

280
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:42,600
rated r4 retarded perfect that is a perfect example of an entry it was

281
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,760
beautiful it might have damn well won if Martin was eligible but he's not so

282
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
what's going to happen is that we're going to pick our favorites like three

283
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,040
four finalists I don't know depends on the entries we get you can still submit

284
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,320
them by the way you have like five and a half hours so if you haven't submitted

285
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,040
anything yet you have time because you have to midnight Pacific tonight to get

286
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,360
your entries in so you can send those in mailbag orange on twitter.com if you're

287
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,220

288
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,640
want to submit it in you have like five and a half hours I'll tell you what you

289
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,560
don't have a lot of competition because only like a handful of people did it so

290
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,000
I guess not that many people want the limited edition one in a grand theft auto

291
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,040
god I don't know I'll tell you it's because they know that I'm going to win

292
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,520

293
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,520

301
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,160

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,200
gaming weeks as I skipped it earlier really not a whole lot of new stuff

303
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,160
because actually I haven't been playing wow a lot lately I kind of took a break

304
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,000
from Wow one game I have been playing quite a lot of and I kind of surprised

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,720
myself as Mario Kart Wii I've actually been having a lot of fun with Mario Kart

306
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,760
Wii I don't play with the wheel either I think the wheel is kind of stupid and it

307
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,480
doesn't control well for me so I use the nunchuck and wiimote which works great I

308
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,600
really like controlling it that way and I was actually playing online for like

309
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,760
an hour or two today and I was having a lot of fun just playing against the

310
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,800
random people because you know how online you don't have a lot of control

311
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,880
but at least the online you notice for Nintendo is starting to slowly inch by

312
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,920
inch get a little better slowly because at least this time it kind of introduces

313
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,680
you to the other players you're about to battle and like shows you where they're

314
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,400
from and you actually get to see their me's and their name unlike kind of like

315
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,240
Smash Brothers ball was like brawl was like completely you know anonymous at

316
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,640
least this time you get to know a little bit about the people you're going up

317
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,840
against and you can play with friends like the other night we were playing on

318
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,560
myself and my roommate were playing against miklotov remember him from the

319
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,880
show he he's lives in Kansas now we were playing against him on the internet and

320
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,160
the cool thing is you can have two people playing on one console and he

321
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,280
kicked our ass ten times in a row I was so mad but I was still a dumb noob so

322
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,040
that's what I chalk it up to but we're just having a lot of fun with the online

323
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,360
I actually think online is kind of fun you know obviously the lack of voice

324
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,200
chat and the lack of a deep decent friend code system I mean nothing new

325
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,280
that no one hasn't said about Nintendo before but it's getting a little better

326
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:44,680
a little baby steps Nintendo's making baby steps so but I phone Mario Kart we

327
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,220
and some of the courses are amazing like I love the Koopa cape which is that

328
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,840
level that's like the kind of like the island one with all the rivers and then

329
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,320
you go you actually go down into a pipe for part of it and you're like driving

330
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,760
through the pipe and then you come out it's awesome so I really like some of

331
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,520
the course design in Mario Kart we I kind of wish there was more of them

332
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,880
j-rod and chat asks hey sky whatever happened the Lost Odyssey you ever

333
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,800
finished that four-disc behemoth um no you know I got towards the end of the

334
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,840
first disc I think I know I'm on the second disc a Lost Odyssey actually and

335
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,440
then Irene called and was like Rob Karazhan and that was the end the Lost

336
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,240
Odyssey no I that's the game I really really do need to go back and beat

337
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,720
because it was amazing amazing story alright now we can get into tonight's

338
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,800
news hooray I'll start tonight speaking of the Nintendo we there is a special

339
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,520
version of the we that is soon going to roll out to hotels it's actually going

340
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,880
to be at the Westin hotels Westin's is a pretty upscale chain of hotels I was

341
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,280
fortunate enough to stay in one in San Francisco once they're really nice kind

342
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,400
of swanky hotels they're actually going to be putting wheeze in their workout

343
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,720
rooms it's like a we workout okay or Westin workout is the program and then

344
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,920
the wheeze is going to be in this here's the interesting thing the wheeze that

345
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,440
they're going to be getting the games are in there automatically no discs are

346
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,680
required so I'm assuming it's you know on the limited space that's in there and

347
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,300
the hotel or is good they're going to slowly add things like we fit and we

348
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,640
sports apparently this whole thing is kind of quote ideal for business

349
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,800
travelers and families who want to stay energized while on the road that's a

350
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,560
quote from the press release that was put out by Nintendo and Westin earlier

351
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,840
this week so what do you think interesting kind of interesting you

352
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,440
don't see video games and workout rooms very often but it just kind of goes to

353
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,840
show that whole like you know the whole we is an exercise machine craze that's

354
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
going on though I don't know how many calories do you really lose playing we

355
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,400
sport I know that you know it depends on how much you play I guess really I guess

356
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,440
being a little bit active is being better than not active at all but

357
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,440
exactly it's just kind of hard for me to kind of picture a we standing next to a

358
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,960
treadmill when you know damn well you're gonna burn more calories on that

359
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,000
treadmill yeah that is true but it makes it more fun and more interactive I mean

360
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,720
like and I don't know boxing have you played boxing like a few times in a row

361
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,360
yeah okay the boxing yeah I gotta get give that to you that definitely does

362
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,200
tell you figure out actually how to play the boxing game realize that all you

363
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,240
just flick your wrist and shut up Loki no but um no I think that's a pretty

364
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,320
cool idea I mean I'd probably rather play that than hop on the treadmill or

365
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,440
lift a bunch of weights you know or something Frisbee asks but what person

366
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,080
is gonna put play Twilight Princess in a hotel workout room well I don't think

367
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,960
that'll be one of the games that's on it because they said you can't put discs in

368
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,760
here so I'm assuming it's going to be games like you know we sports and we fit

369
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,000
in the more active type games yeah I don't if it's gonna be in the workout

370
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,120
room why would they put Twilight Frisbee in our chat also says just put a DDR

371
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,880
machine in there that's that's true why not idea DDR has been around for what 10

372
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,320
years now you haven't heard about that going into workout rooms although DDR is

373
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,160
kind of gone into the mainstream in other places such as school physical

374
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,560
fitness programs we've heard a lot about yeah it's kind of interesting yeah that's

375
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,840
really not a bad how about DDR on the Wii that's like you know workout times

376
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,040
too yeah right totally I think it's also uber lame me you were not a fan of DDR

377
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,800
on the Wii it's stupid it's like oh hey you remember how much how awesome hands

378
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,840
and feet mode was in the PlayStation 2 DDR's yeah let's bring that to the Wii

379
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,320
simple do with the Wii remote oh guess what it still sucks that's right I

380
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,960
didn't think it was that bad oh crap because it's randomly thrown in there

381
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,120
just for the fuck of it and you look like an idiot doing that you don't have

382
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,960
to play with that in there I understand that you know so they'll have to play

383
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,600
with hands and feet mode but the thing is a couple things that was disappointing

384
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,080
about one you couldn't add up your own edit steps using the hands and feet mode

385
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,120
or you know the Wii remote and stuff like that and to just their placement

386
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,760
in the songs as they were it's just kind of random so I don't know it just didn't

387
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,640
really flow with the song at all so all right it was just like hey look you're

388
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,680
burning more calories awesome yeah I do want to say one other thing about this

389
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,560
story before we move on the Westin workout is only going to be at 10 hotels

390
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,200
across the United States I mean obviously there's workout rooms and all

391
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,840
their hotels I'm sure but this we think is only in 10 hotels for now so I'm

392
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,640
assuming it's in the big cities in New York San Francisco whatever I'm assuming

393
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,600
this will roll out slowly to more and more hotels if it's successful but we'll

394
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,880
see because totally I'm not gonna stay at a hotel unless it has the Wii there

395
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
well you know if you got a big family maybe those are types of things you look

396
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,840
for or how about this I don't know if you're vacationing how about you just go

397
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,840
outside and go visit places of interest and get your exercise that way and stay

398
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,680
up like hey let's go to a hotel and go exercise in their exercise room okay

399
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,640
can't do that at home imagine you're a big you're gonna have kids someday Loki

400
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
you got married right and you're gonna have kids someday that's the long-term

401
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,640
plan and my kids will understand how retarded shut up hold on is the thing is

402
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,200
is that you're gonna be going out and let's say you know you go on a trip to

403
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Disneyland or whatever you're gonna be out at Disneyland all fucking day you

404
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,160
and Ellie are gonna be tired as hell when you get back to the hotel and

405
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,560
you're gonna want to go just die you know in the couch and watch TV or

406
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,200
whatever but the kids they have energy nothing but energy so what better than

407
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,040
for them to go to the workout room and burn some more of that energy yeah

408
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,320
because the kids totally want to go to the workout room I can remember when I

409
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,360
went to Disneyland I was like hell let's go to the workout room this would be so

410
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,880
awesome instead of like hey let's go down the arcade downstairs or I don't

411
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,520
know hey let's go out to the pool I go around some or hey let's go run around

412
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,840
or hey how about we play some video games on the TV there I hope your kids

413
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,960
are twice as angry as you they're seriously gonna go are they fucking

414
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,200
serious they want us to go work out downstairs are you fucking crazy you

415
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,640
call me I'll be like shut up Billy you're only five you can't talk back to

416
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,120
me like that you're grounded I hope you really do name your kid Billy okay this

417
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,680
is great act deaf thank you act deaf just backing me up here a little bit act

418
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,040
deaf says Loki this is probably made for busy businessmen and women that go to

419
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,680
places but not actually visit the place excellent point oh so it says in the

420
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,600
press release oh well that makes all the difference why don't they just get some

421
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,880
work done instead and like okay I do this I'm a business traveler I go teach

422
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,200
in other places sometimes I haven't done it for a while sometimes I go to LA or

423
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,560
I go to you know wherever and I don't get put up at the Westin but if if I was

424
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,340
the president of the company I might okay I might actually get a kick out of

425
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,800
this all right fine go get a kick out of this I hope it's worth all the thousands

426
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,600
of dollars that they probably had to pay for it to be exclusive there or I'm

427
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,320
done I'm done I want to move on new subject well another disappointing idea

428
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,520
was the idea to remove clovers credits from the Okami we version not surprised

429
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,680
that clover has been kind of getting the shaft ever since you know they were

430
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:12,840
disbanded but kind of that he said shaft yes I said shaft that's right shaft so

431
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,240
you know it's not a big surprise that with the Wii version of the game coming

432
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,280
out hell let's just get it even sloppier and other than putting watermarks on our

433
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,040
covers let's just remove their they didn't really work on the game it's all

434
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,760
Capcom according to the new game now as I understand it their defense for taking

435
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,920
out the thing was that well clovers not around anymore and the logo was in this

436
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,360
movie file that we couldn't get the logo out of so we took out the whole movie

437
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,520
file that was their defense they couldn't get the logo out of the movie

438
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,800
file yes because they did not have the raw movie file from clover because

439
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,920
clovers gone wow that was there I swear to god I'm not making out that was the

440
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,000
excuse wow that's pretty retarded hell I could get the movie file from just a

441
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,240
fucking video of it it's called script print screen folks print screen you put

442
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,640
the movie file up and you take a screen capture and then you can crop it down of

443
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
course I guess you wouldn't know how to do that since you came fucking find a

444
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,200
picture without a watermark it's just fucking lazy whiz Capcom gotten really

445
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
lazy lately I mean seriously you know with all the fucking Megaman games and

446
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,700
shit that they've got coming out in Street Fighter remakes and fucking

447
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,600
remakes of other games do they have an original idea left with them I mean

448
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,840
seriously whatever it's Okami it's been out before buy it now because you're a

449
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,240
whore and you'll buy these stupid remakes if there is nothing different

450
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,960
with the game other than it's ad waggle so I hope you enjoy your fucking ps2

451
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,240
port that really had that rant had nothing to do with the credits getting

452
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,640

458
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,700

459
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:26,120
credit sequence you know with clovers no logo in there and for one I don't see

460
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,280
why they couldn't just I don't know keep that video sequence since it's pretty

461
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,760
badass looking anyways but still though they can't do a screen capture of this

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,560
this earthbound has been now rated by the ESRB for the Wii virtual console so

491
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,560
you can uh you know actually get to play mother to here pretty soon and no word

492
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,280
on yet when it's coming out but probably pretty soon since it just hasn't been

493
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,480
rated and of course there are some other games other than earthbound that have

494
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:23,640
been rated as well some of these including super dodgeball which is not a

495
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,600
big surprise since I believe dodgeball brawlers is coming out here on the DS

496
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:37,120
pretty soon samurai showdown 2 metal slug and Donkey Kong Country 3 Rob what's

497
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,800
that you need to get earthbound and you actually should finish it I should I I

498
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,540
do love earthbound you know I don't know why I just because I always rented the

499
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,200
game I never actually owned the game I always rented it and they never just I

500
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,120
always ran out of time to finish it but I love it totally like an adult and

501
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,240
you've been one for like a long time so you shouldn't like go well you're

502
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,200
totally like a bitch and you've been one for a long time so you should like it

503
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
you should like actually finish games Rob I know it's I have look I've told

504
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,680
the listeners about this before I have gaming a DD I start a game and then

505
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,180
another game comes out and I go shiny and I throw the other game at a deep

506
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,960
dark closet and I start playing the new game and then something else comes out

507
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,400
and it's a cycle I've total gamer a DD and by the way he means World of

508
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,640
Warcraft yes that old game but he throws into the closet not even this is you

509
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,680
know what not even necessarily World of Warcraft me I haven't played it and you

510
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,120
know I took like a week and a half off the game so you know once in a while you

511
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,120
know I go into console mode or whatever so I know that's kind of sad I've kind

512
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,000
of drifted from consoles in the past few years I used to be like totally pro

513
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,160
console and like kind of sort of anti PC but now it's kind of switched I'm not

514
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,520
anti console but I just don't play console but the only PC game you're

515
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:59,760
playing is World of Warcraft and puzzle pirates my bad yeah this is why World of

516
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,260
Warcraft doesn't come out for consoles it's it's keeping PC gaming alive it is

517
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,120
PC gaming I should say I'm gonna get angry emails from PC gamers and there

518
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,960
well there obviously is much more but obviously World of Warcraft is the

519
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,700
behemoth you can't deny that but there are games come to come in on the turn

520
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:22,360
pack like spore that are gonna be the same thing so you know we're probably I

521
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,680
don't know like this isn't in the show role because I couldn't find the actual

522
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,800
story for it but I mentioned this to you last night how that they have found a

523
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,720
way now since you know they've completely ripped apart the virtual

524
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,040
console they know how to pirate all the games now and stuff now they figured out

525
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,480
how to put games into the virtual console I heard about this how does it

526
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,400
work basically with you know it's kind of like the Xbox 360 and how they

527
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,600
emulates the Xbox games each virtual console game has an emulator built in

528
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,880
with it so what they're basically doing is keeping the emulator in there and

529
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,880
then stripping out the ROM and throwing another ROM in there so it would run off

530
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,160
that emulator and so it works on they've done it with pilot wing 64 Smash

531
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,080
Brothers and some other stuff but I was thinking you know hey you know the

532
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,880
potential for this you can Guardian legends you could do you know Super

533
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Mario RPG pretty much anything that's on the virtual console and they've done it

534
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,240
like I think they've extracted ROMs or put ROMs from other games that are on

535
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,600
other regions into the u.s. ones I think basically just I don't know what'll

536
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,120
happen is you'll see the logo and stuff for whatever game it originally was

537
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,400
because I haven't figured out how to change that yet but with the rate that

538
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,600
they're going right now that won't be long but it's just it's very interesting

539
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,480
how much they've before this was all secure and now it's just poof like night

540
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,320
and day just cracked completely open but uh you know I'm looking forward to like

541
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,720
Guardian legend or something blaster master or something like that on a to

542
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,760
put blaster master on my Wii be awesome oh man but are you worried that there's

543
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,720
going to be a Nintendo patch that comes out that shuts this whole thing off and

544
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,920
possibly bricks consoles that did it I don't think that they can do that worry

545
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,760
brick consoles and the other thing too is it's going to be hard for them to

546
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,880
detect this stuff because they can see they can detect what virtual console

547
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,960
games you you have bought they know that but like if you say for example pirate

548
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,080
one of these games and throw it on there it doesn't detect that it's actually on

549
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,080
the console it's just data that's on there so it would be hard for them to do

550
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,720
that and also who's to say that you couldn't buy legitimate game like by you

551
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,160
know Super Mario Brothers 2 or something like that and then go back delete that

552
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,600
inject something into the Super Mario Brothers 2 file so it still looks like

553
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,640
you have Super Mario Bros 2 but really is like guardian legend or something so

554
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,360
I mean I don't know it's just interesting

555
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,520
totient and chat says injecting ROMs is lame by the damn virtual console titles

556
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,000
thanks well what if they're not out yet what if you keep waiting for me you just

557
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,960
don't want to wait and who's to say that you couldn't buy them later on when they

558
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,560
actually come out but now you're playing them it'll be interesting to see how

559
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,600
long it takes Nintendo to cut this off frisbee says Mario RPG anyone totient

560
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,520
says then buy them when they get out so I guess that would be okay moving on to

561
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,600
non virtual console related things and talking about other types of games for

562
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,240
the Wii and yes we play Xbox 360 and ps3 too it just so happens a lot of we news

563
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,960
this week boogie is apparently going to be getting a sequel boogie superstar has

564
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,320
apparently been slated for October it's been spotted on some websites out there

565
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,040
for shopping I guess like game I don't know they don't say exactly where but

566
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm assuming it's either like game flyer game stop one of those October 14th is

567
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,720
apparently going to be the release date boogie the first one wasn't really that

568
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,480
critically heralded but I guess it did okay out there in the marketplace I

569
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,760
imagine the engine since it's been built it's probably not that hard to inject

570
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,920
new songs and I know there's a new my sims game coming out they saw some

571
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,800
details on it's like my sims mmm I say like medieval fantasy or something like

572
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,480
that it's like said in medieval times but it sounds just like Animal Crossing

573
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,000
now like they're ripping that off big time oh well won't be long speaking of

574
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,160
games like boogie completely random tangent karaoke revolution because I was

575
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,900
thinking about games where they don't change a lot from game to game but the

576
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,160
song list karaoke revolution right you remember that game okay I saw a movie

577
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,320
this week baby mama which was like you know I think was like the number one

578
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,320
movie the box office last week I'm sure it's not anymore thanks to Ironman but

579
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,800
you know baby mama came out karaoke revolution is like a plot device in the

580
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,040
movie it's there's actually like a whole scene where they're playing karaoke

581
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,780
revolution together and kind of like I don't want to spoil it but you know kind

582
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,260
of bonding over karaoke revolution they're actually like explaining how to

583
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,280
play the game and I'm like is this product placement like that's what it

584
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,720
felt like to me I'm like the Konami by product placement in this movie or is

585
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,360
this really like just that much a part of pop culture and I was thinking well

586
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,040
why did they not use sing star hmm conspiracy I don't know but I thought

587
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,360
that was actually kind of interesting have you played boogie I have not played

588
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,800
boogie I've seen videos online I've heard from friends about it that's it I

589
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,080
actually played boogie at a mutual friend's birthday party it was kind of

590
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,360
it was okay I mean there was nothing special about it it was I mean it was

591
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,840
just like karaoke revolution I think I there was like something where you can

592
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,160
make a music video of it or you can like edit you know the words or something

593
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,760
like that like to make it fancy but it's it kind of felt like something that was

594
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,880
more palatable to two kids or something I don't know I don't know why as a lot

595
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,320
of Wii games are yeah but I don't know I just didn't I wasn't thinking like oh

596
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,080
this game needs a sequel they should make one you know when I played it so I

597
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,720
think that's kind of weird but whatever I guess it was they got enough money

598
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,840
from it so all right well sequel coming soon well something that's a little bit

599
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,840
different that's being tested out right now in the Wii homebrew community is USB

600
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:11,480
mass storage support and they just released the source code for USB mass

601
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:18,240
storage device demo which right now only handles basic error handling and just

602
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,800
some basic features but eventually what they're hoping to do with this is allow

603
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,560
the USB support from the console to be able to use like memory sticks flash

604
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:36,440
drives mp3 players you know and fat formatted USB hard drives and I don't

605
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,800
know very interesting that you know kind of like what we saw with the PSP where

606
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,840
they're adding features to the system that aren't yet available kind of solve

607
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,160
some of the problems with the system and then probably will be added later on by

608
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,280
Nintendo type thing kind of like what Sony did with like the music radio

609
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,640
players and stuff like that on their system they went ahead and kind of saw

610
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,120
what the homebrew community is doing and followed it up with their own they

611
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:11,000
really do need to add mass storage to the Wii that's hurt seriously I should

612
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,400
have had more forethought on that but I guess they were trying to keep the price

613
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,320
down so bad but seriously seriously how much does like 512 I would think one

614
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,800
patch and they could fix that I mean if homebrew can do it why can't the Wii

615
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,720
roll out a patch to support it I think because they're just stupid well also

616
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,600
good reason well also because the way they've got it formatted in like blocks

617
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,800
I don't I mean I guess they could still do that but it's you know I don't know

618
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,080
it's just it's no easily you know what I actually just was kind of screwing

619
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,040
around one night and like I have a little mini SD card in my cell phone and

620
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,640
I actually copied a Wii file like I copied the Mario Brothers channel just

621
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,120
for giggles I copied it's in my card and it worked like I didn't have to format

622
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,240
my card for blocks it's mixed in there with pictures I take them on my cell

623
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,940
phone and everything else so it's like I have Mario Brothers in my pocket

624
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,360
everywhere I go but you know it's just kind of messing around seeing if it

625
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,840
will work and it did you didn't have to like format the card specifically for

626
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,480
blocks I don't know it's just it's really lazy that's what it is hmm well

627
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,120
we'll see who knows maybe we'll get a patch in the future especially they want

628
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,760
people to keep buying the WiiWare games they want us to redownload it every time

629
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,080
do the weed out we downloads things really slow sometimes I don't know if

630
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,080
it's just me but sometimes that channel is god-awfully slow and downloading

631
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,760
things especially if you haven't used the Wii in a while I don't know some

632
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,560
other games that are coming out soon for the Wii they're gonna have some pretty

633
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,360
interesting connectivity Ghostbusters you know it's coming out soon here's the

634
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,040
thing is that a red fly the development team behind the Wii version of the game

635
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,440
they're also doing the PlayStation 2 version just you know in the Wii version

636
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,320
you're actually going to be able to use the DS wirelessly no you can't well this

637
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,800
this is what's being reported well yes he came out reported here really it yeah

638
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,240
unfortunately that was something that was rumored to be happening you know

639
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,480
came out and said no that's not gonna happen who said that they actually came

640
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,400
out and said no this was a rumor they did oh I would've been so awesome it

641
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,400
would be an awesome idea and that's why exactly it wouldn't work because it

642
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,800
would be something smart and unfortunately they can't do something

643
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,280
smart because that would be wrong well I guess this is all you get then for cool

644
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,520
news about the Ghostbusters game and it's kind of borderline cool I guess

645
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,000
Bill Murray's coming back as old as he is to do the Ghostbusters lines he's

646
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,760
actually going to be in the game he's recording lines for the game so Bill

647
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,200
Murray will be in it I don't know I'm kind of I'm kind of given take on Bill

648
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,120
Murray he's okay but I love Rushmore like if you've seen that movie from

649
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,120
years ago he was great in that movie but lost in translation put me to sleep so

650
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,320
I'm indifferent I'm Bill Murray there you have it yeah it's in fact here's the

651
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:59,080
story here according to it's not actually the company he said the red

652
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,600
factor whatever it is it's a company called terminal reality is the one

653
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,600
behind it he says I'm sorry to report unfortunately this is not a feature of

654
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,080
the Wii and DS version of the game it would have been really cool though and

655
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:15,800
that's from terminal reality boss I agree it would be really cool fix it

656
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:22,040
delay the game make it soon it's I mean did you say make it so no I didn't yes

657
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,800
you did there was a member there is also that story a long time ago that they

658
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:31,320
were gonna do head tracking with you know boom blocks but from what I hear

659
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,920
and what I kind of gathered the reason they didn't do that is because Nintendo

660
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,200
stopped it because they don't want people there is a story they don't want

661
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,520
people moving a lot in their games cuz they're worried I guess that they're

662
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,840
gonna get injured or something but it's almost like they they can't won't allow

663
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,920
developers to do something innovative unless it's Nintendo's idea type thing

664
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,480
you know to me then we'll we'll roll out the enhancements to your gameplay and

665
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:07,800
then you just follow suit fucking lame interesting but this kind of goes back

666
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:14,960
to a story that we talked about a couple weeks ago actually that whole pole

667
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,160
dancing Wii game it's really being worked on it seriously is a peekaboo

668
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,680
pole dancing now if anything I thought was a joke it was this so this is kind

669
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:34,440
of shocking to me this is the basically a rep for peekaboo and the licensing

670
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,840
agency at 18 new media Simon K this is where they have to say peekaboo will be

671
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,360
all about fun and fitness for new generation peekaboo wants to make

672
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,560
fitness benefits for aerobic pole dancing accessible to millions of we

675
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,680

676

while having fun toning up and burning calories ultimately peekaboo and 80 new

680
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,480
media want to do for pole dancing what guitar hero did for rock and roll okay

681
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,000
flash forward to a year from now okay here's here's a conversation that's

682
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,840
actually going to happen like a year from now okay hey Rob where did you get

683
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:45,840
those washboard abs I was playing peekaboo pole dancing that's what they

684
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,800
should put at the Westin okay oh my god okay here's my thing with this okay this

685
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,560
is never going to work I mean how the hell are they going to really this is

686
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,480
really happening there really really is going to be really going to do this

687
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,080
really really is not a joke I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't said uh no

688
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,160
because I mean they ever happened to the seal of quality this right here it will

689
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,240
yeah seriously what did happen to the seal of quality no this right here though

690
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,600
is going to be so bad I mean granted it's not obviously it's not going to be

691
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,360
a sexual game whatsoever but the fact that you put you know oh it's a game

692
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,000
with us it's teaching you to be a stripper you know that's the spin that

693
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,480
they're going to put on this shit I don't know it's just there was nothing

694
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,640
said about stripping it's aerobic pole dancing there was nothing said about

695
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,600
stripping yeah I participate in aerobic pole dancing and her I should say my

696
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:48,320
wife participates in aerobic pole wow nice that's hot okay so is it just

697
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,440
because they're trying to focus on aerobic games or games that get you

698
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,340
moving it is a bad idea it really is a bad idea it's stupid like honestly how

699
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:04,440
the hell are they gonna do this first off people are gonna you know from what

700
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,400
I gather this stuff is pretty hard I mean it's not like something you can

701
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,040
just go we're just gonna swing around on a pole and stuff you know you got to be

702
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,480
pretty you know in shape to do this kind of crap people are gonna be falling on

703
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,720
their fucking heads I mean it's not like the Wii balance board where you just

704
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,280
stand there kind of lean to the side this is like fucking crazy shit I mean I

705
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,920
don't know is it actually gonna come with a pole I think it's gonna come with

706
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,280
a pole because this company they make like a stripper pole that you can buy

707
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,600
they had they sell them at like fucking Spencer's nice so why do you think I

708
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:46,200
understand how this would work because even okay just a bad idea aside how the

709
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,100
hell are they gonna implement this cuz that's what I was gonna ask like you

710
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,720
what are you gonna have like you know like buttons on this thing or something

711
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,600
is it gonna sense your movement it I don't it doesn't seem like it would work

712
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,200
they're like throwing a concept out there and like okay couple someone make

713
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,640
this please because we can't think of a way to do it I just don't see them this

714
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,400
is not gonna be it working I don't know people will buy it because it's weird I

715
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,840
know that but which will come first Final Fantasy 13 or peekaboo pole

716
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:24,160
dancing pull dancing so do you think they chose the Wii console because of

717
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,200
the fact that it has like a sensor bar and they might incorporate because it's

718
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,320
your fitness driven words you know and honestly the Wii has gotten into a lot

719
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,720
of you know family homes where there's what the women are playing the Wii you

720
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:47,480
mean like housewives moms like strippers yeah strippers yeah well I don't think

721
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,080
strippers need to play this stripping game though or the I mean the excuse me

722
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,160
aerobic pole dancing yeah I think they do that every night home and take their

723
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,640
work home with them or anything so I don't think they're part of the

724
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,640
demographic but you know like you know wives who want to try to feel special

725
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,120
for their husband and want to be sexy for their house oh sweetie sit down I'm

726
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,320
gonna do something special for you and they like turn on the Wii it's like

727
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,840
you're kidding dude most guys would be happy that their wives are playing video

728
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,680
games in the first place but a pole dancing video game that's like I do see

729
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,160
the positives in that yeah I guess like all you have to add to that is her

730
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,040
bringing you a beer and cooking your ribs for dinner and you're set oh that's

731
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:37,560
it yeah that's it perfect yeah I don't know it's just maybe April Fool's joke

732
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:43,760
that won't die yeah all right well these are not a joke it's the upcoming release

too I think Call of Duty 4 is getting the game of the Year Edition finally on

754
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:56,040
PlayStation 3 and see here I think that's pretty much it oh I thought this was

755
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:03,320
still coming out but I think you may have moved again was it a blast works

756
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:17,920
supposed to come out on the Wii I thought but I think it moved I don't know last works I'm really looking forward to hope that doesn't suck I would do Japanese

757
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,000
release dates about this time but there is seriously nothing coming out in Japan

758
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,360
this week at least on the calendar I have the next wave of games is not till

759
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,040
the 15th which will be next week you have luminous arc 2 on the DS to look

760
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,240
forward to next week on the 15th but that as far as this week goes you're

761
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,920
gonna have to play the games you already have nothing new coming out in Japan

762
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:50,160
sorry Japan where we're all no one gets excited and so we kind of teased this

763
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,880
earlier when we decided not to go to e3 because of the ESA membership not

764
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,640
because we weren't invited or anything just because you know we said I was on

765
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,400
Bobby show where that happened by the way not this show whatever Bobby

766
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,280
Blackwell five o'clock on all games whatever we're not going now but anyways

767
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:15,720
Activision and video have discontinued their ESA membership and you know also

768
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:22,600
kind of going along with that they are not going to be at e3 so according to

769
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:28,640
ESA is rich Taylor's senior vice president communications and research he

770
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,280
says we can confirm the Activision of it then bindi games I thought it was

771
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,600
Activision Blizzard but you know I could be wrong opted to discontinue their

772
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,720
membership the ESA remains dedicated to advancing our industry's objective as

773
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,800
protecting intellectual property preserving First Amendment rights and

774
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,880
fostering the benefits our beneficial environmental environment for the entire

775
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,560
industry I guess you don't really have any offensive games or anything so they

776
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,840
don't really need them to defend their rights for anything or you know at the

777
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,200
same time I guess they don't really have to participate in their you know

778
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,960
defending the rights of gamers and gaming industry because they're doing it

779
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,800
for other people it's still kind of loops them in there it's kind of like

780
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:16,360
going along for a free ride type thing says uh let's see while the

781
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,400
Entertainment Software Association remains the permanent voice for the US

782
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,200
computer and video game publishers we can confirm that Activision and video

783
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:33,480
games opted to discontinue the membership and blah blah blah it's

784
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,320
interesting so why'd they do it that's the question of the week it doesn't say

785
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,760
I think they're just being cheap you think well think about it I mean if

786
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,080
you're you know a group of companies or whatever and you're paying the ESA to

787
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,560
say defend you from these you know laws out there that are you know trying to

788
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,200
prevent like say M rated games being sold to anybody or you know calling

789
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,440
games porn stuff like that if you say drop out of this you know organization

790
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,000
this organization is still working for other companies to do that defend them

791
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,800
against other things instead now they have less money to work with that's

792
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,240
really the only downside but they're still fighting for you it's just you're

793
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,200
not paying them you're kind of just sitting there you know it's like your

794
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,880
friends all chipping for pizzas like oh that's cool I'm not really hungry right

795
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,600
now and later on you know oh there's some pizza left over so you start you

796
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,400
know scoffing down a piece well you're just a freeloader yeah it still affects

797
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,160
them regardless of whether they're a member of the USA or not so they why

798
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,840
would they just pay to do that you know and also do they really make any games

799
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,000
that would be affected by any kind of law publicity Activision probably not

800
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,100
because I think they mainly just you know Call Duty 4 is probably the

801
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:54,600
riskiest thing that they have but that's not even really that bad probably not I

802
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:59,360
don't think you know there are a lot of movie licenses and yeah Tony Hawk and

803
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,280
yeah that's actually pretty smart on their part there you know they're gonna

804
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,920
be saving a but it's not cheap it's just you know I don't know I think act

805
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,300
deft and chat makes the comment a lot of people I've kind of seen have been

806
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:18,000
making this week screw e3 packs is where it's at yeah well e3 is kind of its

807
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,780
beginning its decline yes yeah like there's nothing special about e3 anymore

808
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,320
nobody cares about it I think the appeal you think these company actually missed

809
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:32,740
the old e3 it's possible yeah I don't know because a lot of the comments I've

810
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:38,200
seen or theories on it is they got tired of e3 being kind of a pissing contest of

811
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:45,100
who who's flashier who's you know doing bigger things and stuff like that and so

812
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:50,160
now they weren't getting business done and they're just you know it's a kind of

813
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,400
a waste of time for them whereas I don't know like something like packs they have

814
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,160
people that are interested in their product they can you know it's their

815
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,440
target audience I guess and they're still getting the press releases out

816
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,200
there and also now that they've figured out that they can do these gamer days

817
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,840
and no press events like that was my thought exactly it the whole press comes

818
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:11,200
out for gamers day at the all these gamers day stuff why why bother anything

819
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,080
well you know what I mean bastards of the elite press that we didn't get

820
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,800
invited to e3 either so you know whatever but they they get into these

821
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:24,520
things so why bother with e3 and exactly and it doesn't really matter the press

822
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,040
gets to see this stuff anyways cuz a lot of times they're just saying them

823
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:33,000
pre-release copies of these games anyways it really unfortunately press

824
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,840
isn't working the way it used to before where you know people are actually

825
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,600
reporting on things now they're working closely with these game companies and

826
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,920
the game companies are telling them how to report stuff and they're you know

827
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,280
going back and forth and making deals and that kind of thing it's really all

828
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,760
they're kind of like the press is in their pocket type thing nowadays but

829
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,960
does everybody wants to break exclusives yes everyone everyone wants their

830
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,760
exclusives and and fortunately we as we found out the hard way you know that

831
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,720
goes to the people that can make the you know deals say hey I'll tell you what

832
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,680
we'll give you a premium advertising for your game on our website if we can break

833
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,720
this exclusive on the story and and they will just literally you know tell you

834
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,280
one thing oh yeah everyone's gonna get the story at the same time and just boof

835
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:24,040
it gets you know out there and they're like oh well sorry I thought everyone's

836
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:30,280
on the same page about this kind of stuff really right it's it's just you

837
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,240
know they follow the money well they are business people so I would love to see

838
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,680
an underground blog come out that just outs all these things you know what I

839
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:48,280
mean before the company's buy-in if it's possible it might be I don't know I

840
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:54,640
don't know got the comments from chats shadow Charlie simply says fuck e3 we do

841
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,280
says e3 was a sensation that grew too out of control I don't know I would

842
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,360
think maybe some people kind of miss the glam that comes with e3 because boy that

843
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,840
show got a lot of press coverage a lot a lot of press coverage and now the tone

844
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,080
down one not quite as much you know maybe amongst the hardcore gamers sure

845
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:19,960
but amongst the general public not so much I don't know and I and they're like

846
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,680
saying I know their excuses that we've heard before we're just like oh it's

847
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,880
hard you know for us to make demos and stuff for for these events and it really

848
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:34,720
interferes with our production schedules and stuff like that I haven't really

849
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,920
noticed an issue over the last like 10 years or whatever that you know these

850
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,920
have been you know probably even longer that these have been going on so I think

851
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,680
that's just an excuse I think they're just looking the ways to save money

852
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,680
because nowadays I don't know if they're not making as much money or maybe the

853
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,480
margins are smaller but cutting costs any way they can and a glamorous event

854
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,200
like e3 that's definitely inexpensive they can probably do without well guess

855
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,720
what Activision Vivendi are not the only ones who have decided to skip e3 this

856
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,680
year that's what makes the story even more interesting and see soft foundation

857
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,280
9 and Atlas have all also opted out of this year's e3 this has been confirmed

858
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:20,240
by other attendees as well kind of interesting foundation 9 game spotters

859
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,040
reported foundation 9 is out because quote we just didn't feel like we got

860
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,520
enough out of the investment last year in order to justify the expense this

861
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,200
year that is telling me that sounds like a quote where somebody sounds like they

862
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,880
miss is the old e3 not getting enough exposure whereas the old e3 was all

863
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,560
about you know yes it was a little bit sensationalistic but think about all of

864
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,560
that exposure yes you had people at e3 that may may or may not have been there

865
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,000
but they get the word out and they're they're loving all the stuff they see

866
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,920
because it's e3 everybody's pumped every game you play is awesome what they've

867
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,640
changed from you know years past they've gotten rid of like the Kenshia Hall

868
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,280
where you had all the independent game companies and stuff down there were

869
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,040
people you know after they visit all the other booths and stuff they just go down

870
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,120
there and check out a lot of these games that don't normally get press you'll see

871
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,760
a lot of stuff down there that's pretty amazing that will eventually get picked

872
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,500
up by a company and stuff and if they would get a lot of foot traffic a lot

873
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,060
more than they would get you know if they just had a booth at this new e3 you

874
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:22,520
know because from what I heard there was you know obviously before there was a

875
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,200
lot of traveling in between hotels and stuff like that a lot of more of a

876
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,320
strict schedule so it's a lot less time to kind of explore it at your own pace and

877
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,440
that probably also the decreased foot traffic kind of hurt them a little bit

878
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,200
because when you have a lot of stories to cover and stuff a lot of the

879
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,320
independent media doesn't get to cover these you know smaller companies and

880
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,720
that kind of sucks.

881
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:49,520
Alright well also some other speculation going on around the internet about

882
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,680
exactly why this is all going down this week which is probably the biggest thing

883
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,400
to happen this week. Kotaku managed to get the organizer of the Penny Arcade

884
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:04,320
Expo to comment on this. This is from Robert Koo who's the director of

885
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,000
business development for the Penny Arcade Expo quote, the reason that E3 imploded

886
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,080
in recent years was because the publishers felt that it turned into this

887
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,720
sort of pissing contest between them where they were trying to figure out who

888
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,960
could one-up each other.

889
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,640
They all thought to themselves that it just wasn't worth it. I would imagine

890
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,240
that the show is still trying to look out for what the publishers want. That's

891
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,440
the whole goal of the trade association which is to deliver the needs and try to

892
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,240
figure out what their members actually want. So there you have it. More

893
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,840
speculation as to why E3 may be shrinking. It's going to be very

894
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,680
interesting to see what happens in kind of the coming weeks as more you know

895
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,840
kind of gets out. I'm curious if this is going to be the start of a mass

896
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:48,760
exodus or what's going to happen. You may see that because member E4all, same

897
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:53,280
kind of thing happened there with big companies saying oh we're not

898
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,360
going to be a part of this. Microsoft and Sony both pulled out of that didn't they? I think so

899
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:01,400
yeah. You think these companies might go to E4all instead? No. I don't think

900
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,360
they will. I think they'll do their own because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo

901
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,960
don't really need these kind of events anyways because they have their own big

902
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:13,360
events. In fact one we'll be talking about in some last minute stories, the

903
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:17,240
PlayStation day. They invite the press out for that kind of stuff and I

904
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:22,520
know Microsoft has their own conference and same with Nintendo so there's really

905
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:28,600
no reason that they need to be a part of E3. I mean especially if it's going to

906
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,440
cost them a lot more money. I'm sure they would like the press for it and stuff

907
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,840
but I don't know. I still miss the I would hate it if they didn't you know

908
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,360
show up because I miss their press conferences. That's my favorite part you

909
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,720
know hearing all their cool new things. Although Nintendo last year is kind of

910
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:51,520
disappointing with those we zapper and we wheel dumb ideas but whatever. Anywho

911
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,760
back on a different subject here. Prince of Persia. Well we talked a little bit a

912
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,280
few weeks ago that there was gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming

913
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:11,040
out. The brand new game is I guess gonna be just called Prince of Persia and not

914
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:15,040
some sort of Prince of Persia prodigy or whatever but it's scheduled to be

915
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:22,360
released on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It will be a prequel to the previous Prince

916
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:27,800
of Persia series and I believe is gonna be a trilogy as well so it's supposed to

917
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:35,400
introduce I guess an illustrative art style and I guess the DS is also getting

918
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,480
their own Prince of Persia game but it's gonna be exclusive to that console and

919
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:47,360
will be its own unique storyline. So pretty cool hmm and they actually I

920
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:59,160
found I think I found some scans there was a magazine was it it was a joy pad

921
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:04,960
it's a magazine that had some pictures and it looks pretty cool actually it's

922
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:12,560
like almost not really cel-shaded but sort of I don't know how I would really

923
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,200
describe that. What do you think about this Rob here real quick and I'll link the

924
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:24,520
chat room to these scans as well. It's you know I'm not surprised that Prince of

925
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,160
Persia continuing especially you know they have this movie coming out I'm a

926
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,360
little bit surprised they're kind of relaunching it as a you know kind of

927
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,760
spin-off series or what have you but you know if they're gonna do that that's

928
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,720
probably why they're trying to change the look of it and everything so why not

929
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,280
Prince of Persia has always been a solid game I think the best way to describe it

930
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,880
Prince of Persia series is very solid line of games so you know what the heck

931
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,720
but that's an interesting art style I think oh yeah looks like like Okami ish

932
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,560
I don't know yeah I guess it would be like a cross between Okami and say like

933
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,660
I don't know just like a normal like action game it's like I don't know it's

934
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:02,120
really hard to describe it it's a 3d game with like inclines on the outside I

935
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:07,840
guess anyways I'll link it in the chat room it's on a website action trip calm

936
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:14,720
so all right well in other news clock tower you remember this game long time

937
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,120
ago it was out on the PlayStation can you describe what happened in clock

938
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,920
tower you were a girl I don't remember the specifics of it I guess she got like

939
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,800
locked into a towers or I know it was like a house or something a mansion and

940
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,680
basically the objective was for you to hide from this like crazy huge scissor

941
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:40,280
welding guy and he would like you would be walking around like the rooms inside

942
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,040
of the mansion or whatever and he would hear like music or your heartbeat I

943
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,440
don't remember exactly I played it a long time ago but you would know somehow

944
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,840
that he was coming so you had to like hide from him and then he would come

945
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,840
through and like it would be really tense because you don't know if he'd

946
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,440
find you or not because he kind of like he'd walk by he'd sometimes he'd like

947
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,040
look behind stuff or whatever and so that was kind of the big thing about it

948
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,200
I saw this game like one time this game was a trip from oh my god scary it's

949
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:10,080
almost scarier than like Silent Hill and some of those yeah no it's like it's

950
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,880
tense it was brutal too if he found you snap your head got cut off yeah that's

951
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,720
part of the whole tension of it is like oh crap he's gonna find me you know like

952
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,080
yeah but it was good it was good well they're making a movie out of it I

953
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,640
can't wait that's gonna be freaky variety is reported this and there's

954
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,600
been rumors of a clock tower movie for quite a long time what variety is

955
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,760
reported this week that senator entertainment is going to be producing

956
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,120
it Weinstein company is putting it out you know that's they used home your max

957
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:42,540
and all that stuff the guy who wrote borderland Eric poppin is writing the

958
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:48,080
script the folks who produced the hills have eyes to producing this I don't know

959
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,960
so much about that Marco Weber and Martin wise so it should be it sounds

960
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,360
like it'll be at least if nothing else what a good horror film you know like

961
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:03,320
the kind of like a cheap cheesy film you know I want it to have some substance in

962
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:08,720
it you know like I yeah even though it is a video game movie like I don't I

963
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:15,280
want them to actually do something with it all right we'll see what happens well

964
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,160
you know because this week was so big with a grand theft auto 4 people were

965
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:24,080
wondering well where is the PC version of the game and like you may remember

966
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,160
with the other ones it was a while after you know they came out that the PC

967
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:37,040
version finally made its way to the market of course rockstar is doing the

968
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:43,560
old no comment thing on the Grand Theft Auto for PC version but more than

969
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:48,240
likely it probably around at some point people are hoping that maybe by this

970
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,880
holiday will see it on the PC I don't see why they wouldn't mean that's more

971
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,480
sales for them and especially I imagine the PC version probably look a little

972
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:02,780
bit better to especially on some high-end pcs but there are some

973
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:08,120
publishers though they're still listing the game as being released on October

974
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:16,360
30th 2008 of course you know take two or rockstar has not announced the release

975
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:21,760
of that game or even the existence of the game so I don't know if it's any

976
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:27,960
consolation though the last three PC releases for Grand Theft Auto 3 Vice

977
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:33,340
City and San Andreas were all pretty quiet too so maybe there's a

978
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:38,360
possibility although I don't know if three was on the PC wasn't it oh yeah

979
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:43,360
Vice City was Vice City and actually I think three may have been on the PC I

980
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:48,800
don't remember but I know Vice City and San Andreas were all right well guess

981
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:55,480
what I've got for you guys here before we get to the end of part a yes it's

982
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:02,360
another stupid award for the week sadly this week it's it's not so gruesome I

983
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:06,240
guess it's actually good things we don't actually like people dying but this is

984
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:13,160
very stupid nonetheless happened in San Diego 27 year old robbed a GameStop he

985
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:18,220
actually pepper sprayed two employees and stole launch day copies of Grand

986
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:26,120
Theft Auto 4 however as the person who actually robbed the store Richard feel

987
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,940
is his name they actually have a little picture of him on the internet in the

988
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:34,360
back of the police car he found that real life is a little bit harder than

989
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:38,720
Grand Theft Auto because police actually found a copy of Grand Theft Auto they

990
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:42,520
they got him and they found a copy of Grand Theft Auto 3 and a PlayStation 3

991
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,440
controller in his pickup truck along with the stolen copy of Grand Theft Auto

992
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,880
4 here's the police department commented to the local NBC affiliate in San Diego

993
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,360
the call came out as a robbery of a commercial business and the suspect was

994
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,320
described in the vehicle truck that he got into was described as a white

995
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,040
Toyota pickup truck lifted with the tailgate down and our helicopter Abel

996
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:10,680
spotted the vehicle southbound the officers followed it so that was it no

997
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:21,440
word on how many stars he accumulated a comment from chat alpha canagram says I

998
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,920
bet Lord Voldemort paid that dude to do it of course load Lord Voldemort is our

999
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:36,880
other name for you know who probably paid him to do it anyhow if you're gonna

1000
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,320
steal a game we just shouldn't steal a game stealing games is stupid it's been

1001
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,920
he stole one game

1002
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:51,720
it's just funny no you shouldn't steal at all it's it's very bad when you steal

1003
01:17:51,720 --> 01:18:01,560

time it's we're at the end of part a finally we surprisingly rate ran long

1009
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,640
tonight with not much gaming news and you know it's there's always a segment

1010
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,000
that we do this part of the show so we had to bring you here to give us your

1011
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
classic game of the week

1012
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,960
your part of the show where we pay respect to our elders in gaming with

1013
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,600
Jamie picking out a game from the long lost archives of games that folks should

1014
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,920
really check out this week so Jamie what did you pick for the kids tonight I

1015
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,800
picked out nothing that was obscure or crazy or weird or anything I picked out super mario brothers 3

1016
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:14,520
why not a true classic one of my favorite games when it came out I went

1017
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,960
completely crazy it was the only reason that I would see the other wizard to

1018
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:26,160
begin with the game you know it was you know what super mario brothers 2 was

1019
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,640
over here wasn't really super mario brothers 2 super mario brothers 2 was

1020
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,960
more like the original was more like a rehash of the first game whereas 3

1021
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:40,160
actually did some real innovations by having your different worlds different

1022
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:53,280
things like that the whole point of it is the whole point was that formula that

1023
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:58,960
everyone had become accustomed to and then blew it up really big so it was really cool

1024
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:09,640
you had different worlds you had world 1 was grassland, world 2 was desert, 3 was seaside, 4 was big island, 5 was the sky

1025
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:17,720
6 was iceland, 7 was pitanese, and 8 was castle kubak

1026
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:25,360
each world had you know different maps that would go along with the theme of

1027
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,520
whatever that world was but you also had different little mini fortresses that

1028
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,760
you had to go through and then you had your primary thoughts with different ways of

1029
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:39,960
beating them although a lot of them were just like a certain type of a different

1030
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:45,360
pattern would fit like different ones those three I remember the bosses the

1031
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,480
bosses were all pretty easy if you just keep stomping on their heads repeatedly

1032
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:53,480
and don't let him get don't let him get any moves on you well now remember you

1033
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,960
have the ones that were on the rocking platform oh that's true and then you

1034
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,880
have and then you have the ones that were in the room that would shrink I

1035
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:06,480
guess as long as you kept up your pattern it was easy

1036
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:15,120
oh we have some boss model music in here well for the fortress music and this

1037
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,720
you know what made this game super famous here's what I remember about

1038
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,360
Super Mario Bros 3 this will always be my not only I believe is this the best

1039
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,000
selling video game ever which makes it a true classic but this was the game that

1040
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,360
was not originally packaged with the system oh that okay the way oh yeah

1041
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,480
because obviously you know you have Super Mario Brothers is the pack and of

1042
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,840
course that's gonna sell more technicality I remember this game for

1043
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:48,920
being featured in the movie the wizard I think that was the motivation for a lot

1044
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:56,080
of us was to see like the first sneak peek at Super Mario Bros 3 remember the

1045
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,160
guy introducing it in the movie he made it sound all like holy it's great and

1046
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:05,640
now we're like yeah but the other thing that I thought was really cool about

1047
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,880
that he was a different power-ups that you would get you had your usual

1048
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:17,720
mushroom you had your fire flower but you also had the raccoon tail that you

1049
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,960
could get that was always like my favorite to have ever you had your you

1050
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:28,320
know your power stars we had you know all your other mushrooms the Tennessee

1051
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,320
suit was fantastic because you could also turn into the monk statue and the

1052
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,400
enemy who just ignore you for a little bit except you really didn't do that on

1053
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,800
the donut level you don't anybody donut level where you'd run over the little

1054
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,400
donuts and they would fall you can get on that level could you die but the

1055
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,440
other cool thing about the Trinity students if you turn into the statue

1056
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,320
while you're airborne you'll land on something and it'll kill it and it's

1057
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:55,680
great you also get the peeling which was there's actually two items as a peeling

1058
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:01,840
or an anchor and you get this out of some of the toad houses and it's like if

1059
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,520
you collect a certain number of coins on even number world you would get the

1060
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:14,240
anchor if you did it on the odd world and you would get a peeling or maybe

1061
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:20,080
through the way around anyway so yeah it was that way um also on a couple of the

1062
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:25,560
places you could get a hammer brother suit you could go hammers and there was

1063
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:34,000
one fire brother that would um but you uh I'm being scared out by my husband

1064
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,760
then says the anchor was worthless however to shoot rock the anchor was

1065
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,400
worthless you know what I will tell you though you want piss me off about

1066
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:49,680
power-ups Jamie okay go ahead that's why I was gonna say no no not just the fact

1067
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,680
that it was there but what pissed me off you can only use that damn shoe in one

1068
01:23:52,680 --> 01:24:05,600
level I know you know what they should go ahead they should make a game for the

1069
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:11,560
Wii called kuriboh shoe everybody would buy it that would be great well there

1070
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,240
were some different levels between the American and Japanese version some were

1071
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:23,640
changed for matters of just copy did it cause the game to glitch like in world

1072
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,960
five there was in five one if you would have to go to a pipe to get to where the

1073
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:33,640
screen goes black and white and it would actually cause the game to glitch up

1074
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,720
pretty bad um also if you got hit in the Japanese version no matter what power

1075
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:43,320
if you had you would go back to being small if whereas in the American one you

1076
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,080
would just go to being super and then to be small except with the kuriboh shoe

1077
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,960
which was you'd go back to being small in Japanese version but in American one

1078
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,840
you just go back to whatever power-up you had then to super and then to small

1079
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:05,800
and the music of the game was done by Koji Kondo who I got to meet and he's a

1080
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:13,720
guy yeah and there were remakes there was the Satellaview version for Super

1081
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:19,880
Famicom which is basically the enhanced version that looked like Super Mario All

1082
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:25,440
Stars which again was another version and actually Super Mario All Stars had

1083
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,000
the version that came out actually retained some of the stuff that was in

1084
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,920
the Japanese version and not in the u.s. one we also got Super Mario Advance 4

1085
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:39,640
Super Mario 3 which was pretty cool and had stuff added and you know I did spice

1086
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,600
it up a little bit and that one was developed by Nintendo R&B 2 pretty cool

1087
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:49,000
there were e-reader extra levels that would extend the game but they were

1088
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,240
really convoluted and hard to do so it was like people just said I screw it and

1089
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:58,960
didn't bother I don't even remember that they had Super Mario Brothers 3d the

1090
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,960
Walmart cards and some that came with the game with might with Super Mario

1091
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:11,360
Advance 4 that the extensions were for the advanced version but you had to have

1092
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:17,360
the e-reader 2 GBAs a link cable and the card you wanted and you would hook up

1093
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:25,400
the GBA with the cartridge and the connector will go in the e-reader and

1094
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,680
then you would do all this convoluted crap and it was a big pain in the ass

1095
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,120
and not I mean the levels were cool and it really opened up I think a lot of

1096
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:38,720
potential to have you know almost infinite playability as long as people

1097
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,240
are willing to put up with the crap you had to do to use the e-reader but other

1098
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:48,760
than that you know of course the whole e-reader thing sort of died out once

1099
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,000
they started upgrading the hardware very interesting very interesting comment

1100
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,080
from Rama in chat Nintendo give us Super Mario Brothers 4 you know we never

1101
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:02,920
really have had just a plain Super Mario Brothers games since Super Mario

1102
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,000
Brothers 3 I mean sure there's been Mario World there's been countless other

1103
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,960
games have had Mario in it but there's never ever been a Super Mario Brothers

1104
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:29,920
4 I guess so but it was also you know down to the world down to powerups down

1105
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,440
to all the specials and actually if I do remember right I think that you the

1106
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:41,560
Super Mario World feather was actually the power-up and you could use that as

1107
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:47,240
a power-up in Mario and Mario for advanced but I really think the world

1108
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,400
could be considered I think it's just as they decided to stop numbering them

1109
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,160
because it would get ridiculous and then fall into you know street fighter

1110
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,840
formula true and hit stem points out that you also have the one on the DS that

1111
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,560
really really if anything was like the closest thing we've had to Mario 3 in a

1112
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:06,320
long time you know I mean that was oh yeah new Super Mario Brothers about

1113
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:11,520
Mario advanced so yeah one four but yeah we didn't have that I guess and mean the

1114
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,440
Mario and we had a lost levels not lost levels but the all-stars all right well

1115
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:23,200
any other thoughts on the Super Mario Brothers 3 it was fun and I'm gonna

1116
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:28,560
break out my my top loading Nintendo soon and play the hell out of it when I

1117
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,520
don't feel like I'm gonna fall over and I just don't use whistles because you

1118
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:38,160
know that's cheating no it's not cheating we are going to have a

1119
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:42,560
discussion right here right now about using the work with those it's not

1120
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:48,560
cheating it for a reason I know it's okay into the game it's not cheating but

1121
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:55,280
you've got to admit so much more fun to play without warping you you don't get

1122
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:01,280
to play big world if you war big world is the bomb I agree with that but you

1123
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,040
can work to get ahead to get right to big you know you can go right there

1124
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:13,560
that's only half cheating okay okay it was programmed into the game for a

1125
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,360
reason and you know what you know what I had the same argument with people who

1126
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,320
say oh you can't use speed ups on DDR either of like okay go back and play

1127
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:28,200
beat mania without you know speed up it wasn't in the original all right fine

1128
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:33,360
warp all you want but I want big world and the level with curry boshu they'll

1129
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:38,320
program more all right all right Jamie we got to wrap up part a so we get to

1130

1134
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:06,840
lot of energy left in her she talked for 10 minutes about Mario Brothers 3 she's

1135
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,320
very passionate about that game but it is it is probably one of like the best

1136
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,480
games of all time I mean you can't deny that I absolutely can I absolutely yeah

1137
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,600
I mean if there is any classic game I mean just because y'all happen to have

1138
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,640
