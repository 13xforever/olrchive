tonight May 4th 2008 some gaming companies drop out of this year's E3
Atari is getting bought and is there actually a way to add storage to your Wii?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of
orange lounge radio we are that podcast on the internet and live talk show
dedicated to video games video gaming gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
my name is Rob Roberts not joining us tonight sadly is the one only dark
Sakura Jamie Summers she has the night off
I actually happen to know that she is hanging out with one of the OLR
lesbians tonight it's been a long time since we've had all our lesbians on the
show but it's because makes these back in Wisconsin and Chris is actually
moving out to Wisconsin as well so we're sadly not gonna have them on the show
for quite a while after that but they're having their last I guess girly weekend
or whatever girls do before Chris moves what what do girls do rice princess
who's joining us tonight a very special guest filling in tonight
you're shopping you go shopping and talking about boys yeah I guess but not
if you're a lesbian I guess I don't know oh then they do other things like I
don't know chopping their flannel nothing would knock it off yeah that's
smart ashy here over there is one and only tech master Loki how are you Loki
good except this cord is like attached to the no that's not gonna work either
I mean oh yeah always have technical difficulties here in our lovely studio
court is like way too small which supposedly you can see through it which
supposedly you can see live on www Justin I'm sorry Justin TV comm slash
orange launch radio but our video or fucking mustard I swear to god there's
mustard all over me yes mustard what in the hell this show is completely
disorganized tonight what you delicious mustard I don't know first the mics are
tangled in the problem is because she's sitting over here instead of sitting
over in Jamie's like abyss over there so well because of that I have to move this
stupid thing around the chair I want to get her scoot back we want to get her
pretty little face on cam even though the cam is kind of sucking tonight sorry
there all right how you doing I'm fine all right now except that mustard on me
how was your week outside of the goddamn mustard it was okay I went to Vegas how
was Vegas you went there for some type of like gaming demo or something right
yeah we went there too I don't know what you would really call I guess the gaming
expo we were the expo what's a Zappos you may remember them of the shoes and
apparel website they have like commercials now on TV and stuff so we
went there we got the tour and then we demoed games there which I got to play
you know quite a few of them because that's what I was doing is playing games
and basically you know just kind of teaching them the basics about games and
stuff just throwing some like facts out there for him basically just to get him
excited about games it was cool though they had a DDR supernova machine there
so I got to play that for a little bit and then what else did we play there we
had a Gran Turismo 5 prologue setup which I mean that game looks good but
you know I just never was really interested in the Gran Turismo series
but pretty I'll give them that and got to use the nice dual shocks and stuff so
all the rumbles which you know I guess that's neat then we also had set up
Mario Kart Wii so I finally used the Wii wheel instead of just you know
hooking it out the door be honest there's really hardly any difference
between the Wii wheel and just holding the controller sideways and I hate it I
absolutely hate it but we played you know that for a while and then I tried
also they had a well Halo 3 set up so I was playing a little bit of a death
match there that was fun Call of Duty 4 which I've played that before and that
looks nice we had Grand Theft Auto 4 set up because I brought my copy actually
with me I actually brought my 360 with me ironically enough that I didn't get
chance to actually play it in my hotel room at all so that kind of sucked but I
did play it at the event and I had already memorized a lot of the cheat
codes so I was just spawning helicopters and chopping people with the rotor
blades and stuff and just fun stuff like that and people seem to enjoy it then we
had Wii Sports being demoed you know pretty much everything from that and
Smash Brothers once again I had to play with it you know the controller sideways
which I hate it and I think that's it so that's what we were demoing for them and
they really enjoyed it and it's a great company to be honest I'd work there
tomorrow if I could but you know they're all the way in Henderson Nevada and we're
all the way out here in Sacramento but shit man if they were out here absolutely
awesome company just everyone loved working there they cater lunch and
breakfast every day they have vending machines full of stuff that's all free
just very fun going you know environment well since you were getting into your
gaming week why don't you tell us a little more about what other types of
games you've been playing this week anything outside of Vegas yes well more
Grand Theft Auto 4 we finally got our internet open at work so now we can
start doing the death matches online which is awesome very looking forward to
that I played a five minute death match with one of my co-workers and it was fun
it's pretty hard to spot people especially even with all the
pedestrians raining around because you know you do see their name above their
head and stuff but sometimes it's hard to spot on me amongst all the pedestrians
so that's pretty cool and then today we just kind of play the like a fuck-off
game you know it's a free play thing and that was fun it played that for about I
think a good half hour 45 minutes and just you know flying around helicopters
and just you know fucking around running for the police it was really fun it
really I really want to get more into the multiplayer in this game that's for
sure in the single-player version of the game is pretty fun too I've been doing
more of the missions and stuff and kind of along in the stories starting to you
know come around a bit so I'm very you know looking forward to this game a lot
I'm just worried though that because even like flying to the different
islands and stuff it's like okay now I've seen everything and you know I
don't know but I think it's still very confusing stuff driving around you don't
you know it's hard to orient yourself a little bit more than say the other games
because there's a lot less than those other games but it's a good game
definitely a good game and see what else they play Oh crisis core played that a
little bit on the plane I really can't get in that game very much it's too
linear just really because people have just been like you know swooning all
about crisis core some kind of surprise it's very linear I mean if you don't get
a lot of place I mean you can go explore a little bit but it's very empty I don't
know it's just I maybe I'm not that far into the game maybe not far enough to
where the game just shifts to where you can run around anywhere and do whatever
but it's just very linear and just empty even more so than like the other but
that's kind of typical for like a PSP game though they're usually very sparse
because they can't handle them any polygons on the screen stuff but that
might be the first negative thing I've heard about crisis core it's just I
can't get into it I want to get into it because it looks really cool but we got
to get to the chat room for comments chat orange lounge radio.com if you want
to join us or if you're on the game surge network where the all games chat
room also is we're in our own chat room at channel orange lounge and first
comment tonight from act theft he says more like crisis bore that is that what
it is then I mean I actually instead of playing the game on my you know flight
back I decided to read the sky mall magazine that gives you an idea I chose
the sky ball magazine over crisis core sky ball has some pretty sweet stuff and
they do have some pretty interesting things in there they had some things I
was like hey that's a pretty cool idea good times anything else um I played
something else oh I was playing this web flash game it's for Castle Crashers but
you're fighting a guy with a beard what is a giant head with a beard wait it's
it's a demo for Castle Crashers no it's like a flash game that the guy that
created Castle Crashers made with the character okay also Crashers and you're
fighting the guy the beard interesting it I can't remember the name of it I'll
find it but uh it was interesting all righty I never say this name right I
apologize this poor guy oh we too says Loki is reviewing a game but nothing
compares to his beloved Grand Theft Auto 4 is that true I mean it's good I just
enjoyed a lot more I don't know it's not I'm not seeing that it's better than any
game out there it's just I'm enjoying it a lot more right now I mean what's he
throw to comes out who knows I mean awesome that probably awesome for
completely disagrees with you says crisis core is the downright best game
on the PSP I don't know about that all right what would you say is the best
game on the PSP out of can I see played so far yeah you know I'd probably have
to say grant that thought of I knew it I knew it just just because I played a lot
of that game it's just it's fun but you know I don't know if they put like Final
Fantasy 7 like the actual 7 on there I would probably say that would be pretty
fun and Final Fantasy 1 on the PSP was pretty fun so I don't know just maybe
some more of the retro games I guess I like stuff well I'll say like I liked
Space Invaders extreme I really like that game but that game did seem like a lot
of fun with the few minutes I played the one you had any of I that's something
they need to bring to live in like the PlayStation Network seriously that would
do so well for them but Space Invaders extreme by the way like if you like
those like music Gucci games like resin stuff or every extend extra like mix
that with Space Invaders that's what Space Invaders extreme is it's pretty
hot because I am a huge like Loki is to Grand Theft Auto I love music Gucci like
I everything he touches I will do felt like I even defended 99 nights okay like
I'll admit it wait what you say that I don't even know what that 99 nights came
out of the Xbox 360 and it was kind of the what's the game is just like thank
you dynasty warriors but it had its issues but I came on the show and I was
like it's not a bad game it just needs a little work so we all have our things we
get fanboy over what do you get fanboy over rice princess or fangirl I don't
really have anything currently that I get all like mmm over anymore just the
typical like Nintendo franchises what about Chrono Trigger oh okay cuz I seem
to remember a few weeks ago on this program I took a lot of heat for not
declaring okay Chrono Trigger is great didn't care too much about Chrono Cross
didn't wasn't really impressed by that Chrono Trigger remake they were doing
the 3d one what okay that's not a 3d child I am like strictly a 2d type of
person all right that's why I didn't care for it but yeah I'm kind of a
boring person when it comes you like your games very two-dimensional and
vanilla totally yeah what about the 2d games with that 3d kind of look to them
like I don't know beautiful Joe kind of that's see that's cool with me and it's
not okay it's it's case by case it's not strictly I won't play any 3d games I
play 3d games it's just my preference I feel that they put more effort into the
game when it's 2d because they're not focusing on trying to make it look all
cool because it's 3d I don't know I just Super Nintendo forever comments from
chat siren says and I'm probably another name I'm mispronouncing but you know
what I do that I'm mispronouncing it's amateur radio says Chrono Trigger equals
not that great oh you equals not that great
awesome first says 99 nights I remember being reviewed on x-play with a girl
screaming horribly I remember watching x-play and I was screaming horribly
you're such a dork all right well how was your gaming way what kind of games
have you been playing this week I'm assuming Loki's done if he's not I cut
him off what how was your gaming week I'm done boring I played Wow and I
started playing puzzle pirates again nerd okay if for whatever reason let's
say a listener the show has never heard of puzzle pirates before is it a free
MMO okay it went from beta to charge and now they have kind of this system where
you can play for free and then like buy certain aspects of the game with real
money like if you want to have Johnny Depp hair you got a yeah exactly yeah
like clothes or an island or something like that you can pay for it but
essentially it's just a big puzzle game if you've ever played something like
puzzle quest or something it's kind of sort of like that but in a pirate
setting you sail the ship by playing a puzzle you build the stations you do
carpentry all that crap you know but they're all like pop cap games basically
because building is like bejeweled right yeah yeah it's pretty much like one of
them was like dr. Mario yeah I think it was a sailing one yeah yeah but yeah
it's basically what it is but it's fun and it's addictive and like it is like
it's like pop cap the MMO with pirates exactly that is exactly what it is
that's a great description so but it's really fun and I like have been spending
countless hours playing I know a few people have really gotten sucked into
puzzle pirates yeah a few people on my live journal on the friends list they
just always talk about you know puzzle pirates it's good time it's like Wow for
the puzzle crowd I guess you could say all right yeah pretty cool my gaming
week I must be I feel like the one person on the planet who has not been
all getting into Grand Theft Auto 4 here's my thing I like I respect let me
put this I respect Grand Theft Auto 4 I think it is a good game but it's just
not kind of like my thing like I have this big concern I'm gonna spend $60 in
this game and I don't really play Grand Theft Auto for the story because I'm
just not into those types of stories and I think I would have a lot of fun
running around for like three hours and blowing everything up I possibly can and
shooting people in the face but then I think it would kind of get old for me
but I don't know the online modes make me think maybe I'd have a little more
fun with it so I'm still kind of on the fence I want to wait for the game to
come down in price but we all know that's not gonna happen for a long long
time long time but you see long time you say that about it but I mean it's kind
of like Wow you do the exact same thing over and over there's something more Wow
has a chat room I can't explain it yeah I guess that's a good point but I mean
I've always said game Wow Wow is a giant chat room with spells like basically you
know kind of true but I mean like there is gonna be the you know there's the
online element to it and I don't know you would just I think if you pick it up
and play it you might get more into it than you actually think you would Rob
it's just me there well J rod says why doesn't sky just borrow it from Loki
does he keep it in a fireproof safe guarded by pit bulls or something no I
think it's not a fireproof safe it's the safety deposit box that came with my you
know my special edition plus I would I would think that Loki just wants to hang
on to it for a little while he'll probably let me borrow it in like six
weeks well I can't let you borrow because I have to use it at work when we
play our weekly death match early death matches so I mean I have four copies of
the game right now you gotta let that Loki has four copies of the game and he
won't let me borrow one five we have five people that want to play it at work
and in fact I need to get another copy of it it's fine it's fine like I said I
will buy it eventually I don't know when that's going to be he's only got four
copies Rob I will find you one shit God it's all good don't worry about it I
don't know why you know me you know I gotta play one of the best games of you
know you're gonna find it for me I'm gonna play it for three hours and then
Irene's gonna call and be all like Rob Cara's and and I I'll be like bye grand
theft auto I'll load it to you and then just like I haven't had a chance to play
I've been playing World of Warcraft like three weeks later hey so how do you like
grants I was out of four I still haven't played it yet I'm running her I decided
to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little bit you don't understand slave
pens was the daily heroic I had to do it and then survivor came back on TV so I
have to watch that don't even joke about survivor right now you know I'm tangent
I'm hosting an online survivor you because I'll tell you what one thing I
love besides video game is cheesy reality shows and I'm actually hosting a
survivor game online right now and the cast that's playing is very fierce it's
live journal survivor and I played it like last year and it was a lot of fun
and the cast is in it right now funny I'm having so much fun watching them
just kind of like because I get to see everything they write behind this it's
funny I'm having a great time I don't know how much I can say because some of
them might be listening but I'll just say everybody is definitely there to win
so it's fun it's fun to watch I hope it's much better than that you know
there was like a survivor PC game that came out like I think there were two of
them that came out total shit total shit yeah one of them you could actually play
online and you could actually be one of like you could be Richard Hatch oh like
not pay your taxes Wow so look I make no apologies for things that I might like
I'm really sorry I play Grand Theft Auto because I was too busy hosting yet
another survivor online no next will be Big Brother all right any I'll survive
our survivor Big Brother game look you know Big Brother on an island look you
know like if okay cuz you know penny arcade Expo is coming up and there's
gonna be tons of people from all games there you know if it like all game
survivor happened in packs it would be good stuff would be funny all the
challenges could be about video games okay maybe not all right look we have
some housekeeping to talk about tonight first off as you've already figured out
dark soccer is not here tonight I'm not sure if she's gonna be in to do the
classic game tonight we have a backup plan just in case but dark cyber is not
here tonight also I have to apologize in advance specifically to footy monster
and toshin because last week I promised epic match game tonight and we're not
gonna be able to do it tonight because we don't have enough people and I wasn't
able to get together the you know cuz I had what Warcraft and survivor stuff to
see I wasn't able to round up some of the other stuff I want to do this is why
he does not get Grand Theft Auto for loan to him I didn't even talk about my
gaming we buy well in a minute I'll do housekeeping first I'll talk about game
week so there won't be match game tonight we're gonna table it to next
week I promise we will have it next week or not the Grand Theft Auto for contest
ends tonight Grand Theft Auto for contest in tonight you know that a
contest we've been submit or asking you guys to submit your own kind of
Grand Theft Auto style radio ads and we put the winners or I'm sorry the winners
will be put into voting and your guys's favorite will be the finalists and the
finalists will go over to all games calm to compete against all the other
finalists from the other like what 10 shows 14 shows on a lost count however
many shows are competing and yeah it's gonna be fun it's okay Rob see when I
win this like this contest and win another copy of the game all happened
alone you that one how nice alright what I did want to play for you guys as I
promised last week I said we got a really great entry from somebody who
unfortunately is ineligible because for reasons beyond our control namely the
fact that the limited edition console that is the grand prize only works in
the United States or North American regions I should say Canada Mexico are
fine but it will not work in Europe okay we had to say you know North American
residents only so unfortunately this guy was ineligible but I think the commercial
is so damn funny I want you guys to hear it so this is Martin from Belgium and
this is his entry for the contest that unfortunately is ineligible we wanted to
play it on the show because it's so great introducing Loki's world of
randomness do you have no free time are you tired of raising your children are
your children little pussies getting beat up just drop them in front of the
TV with Loki's world of randomness run around a virtual world in a bingle
outfit while performing random acts it will teach your children important
skills such as how to attach a laser to their pet cat disembodied heads how to
take pictures of guys kissing or how to shout fuck a combination of all of the
above if your children suffer mental damage from playing this game or start
killing their friends with their laser cats it may result in a bonus lawsuit
settlement from our legal department this game is approved by wappy play.com
rated r4 retarded perfect that is a perfect example of an entry it was
beautiful it might have damn well won if Martin was eligible but he's not so
what's going to happen is that we're going to pick our favorites like three
four finalists I don't know depends on the entries we get you can still submit
them by the way you have like five and a half hours so if you haven't submitted
anything yet you have time because you have to midnight Pacific tonight to get
your entries in so you can send those in mailbag orange on twitter.com if you're
listening right now if you're listening on the podcast you're screwed so if you
want to submit it in you have like five and a half hours I'll tell you what you
don't have a lot of competition because only like a handful of people did it so
I guess not that many people want the limited edition one in a grand theft auto
god I don't know I'll tell you it's because they know that I'm going to win
you're ineligible asshole all right so anyway but I will say there are some
other good ones too we will play our favorites in a special podcast that will
roll out sometime this week you guys can vote for them on our site www.orange
on twitter.com it the special podcast will be like just eight minutes long
with the finalists and you can vote so you know who you're voting for on
orange on twitter.com good times so that winner will be announced next week's
show and also did anyone else notice this is slow news week this week thanks
to grand theft auto for what I see you're smiling evilly over there I is
it just me that noticed it was a slow news week I don't know no no I didn't
notice well because I was too busy playing grand that's why I thought my
gaming weeks as I skipped it earlier really not a whole lot of new stuff
because actually I haven't been playing wow a lot lately I kind of took a break
from Wow one game I have been playing quite a lot of and I kind of surprised
myself as Mario Kart Wii I've actually been having a lot of fun with Mario Kart
Wii I don't play with the wheel either I think the wheel is kind of stupid and it
doesn't control well for me so I use the nunchuck and wiimote which works great I
really like controlling it that way and I was actually playing online for like
an hour or two today and I was having a lot of fun just playing against the
random people because you know how online you don't have a lot of control
but at least the online you notice for Nintendo is starting to slowly inch by
inch get a little better slowly because at least this time it kind of introduces
you to the other players you're about to battle and like shows you where they're
from and you actually get to see their me's and their name unlike kind of like
Smash Brothers ball was like brawl was like completely you know anonymous at
least this time you get to know a little bit about the people you're going up
against and you can play with friends like the other night we were playing on
myself and my roommate were playing against miklotov remember him from the
show he he's lives in Kansas now we were playing against him on the internet and
the cool thing is you can have two people playing on one console and he
kicked our ass ten times in a row I was so mad but I was still a dumb noob so
that's what I chalk it up to but we're just having a lot of fun with the online
I actually think online is kind of fun you know obviously the lack of voice
chat and the lack of a deep decent friend code system I mean nothing new
that no one hasn't said about Nintendo before but it's getting a little better
a little baby steps Nintendo's making baby steps so but I phone Mario Kart we
and some of the courses are amazing like I love the Koopa cape which is that
level that's like the kind of like the island one with all the rivers and then
you go you actually go down into a pipe for part of it and you're like driving
through the pipe and then you come out it's awesome so I really like some of
the course design in Mario Kart we I kind of wish there was more of them
j-rod and chat asks hey sky whatever happened the Lost Odyssey you ever
finished that four-disc behemoth um no you know I got towards the end of the
first disc I think I know I'm on the second disc a Lost Odyssey actually and
then Irene called and was like Rob Karazhan and that was the end the Lost
Odyssey no I that's the game I really really do need to go back and beat
because it was amazing amazing story alright now we can get into tonight's
news hooray I'll start tonight speaking of the Nintendo we there is a special
version of the we that is soon going to roll out to hotels it's actually going
to be at the Westin hotels Westin's is a pretty upscale chain of hotels I was
fortunate enough to stay in one in San Francisco once they're really nice kind
of swanky hotels they're actually going to be putting wheeze in their workout
rooms it's like a we workout okay or Westin workout is the program and then
the wheeze is going to be in this here's the interesting thing the wheeze that
they're going to be getting the games are in there automatically no discs are
required so I'm assuming it's you know on the limited space that's in there and
the hotel or is good they're going to slowly add things like we fit and we
sports apparently this whole thing is kind of quote ideal for business
travelers and families who want to stay energized while on the road that's a
quote from the press release that was put out by Nintendo and Westin earlier
this week so what do you think interesting kind of interesting you
don't see video games and workout rooms very often but it just kind of goes to
show that whole like you know the whole we is an exercise machine craze that's
going on though I don't know how many calories do you really lose playing we
sport I know that you know it depends on how much you play I guess really I guess
being a little bit active is being better than not active at all but
exactly it's just kind of hard for me to kind of picture a we standing next to a
treadmill when you know damn well you're gonna burn more calories on that
treadmill yeah that is true but it makes it more fun and more interactive I mean
like and I don't know boxing have you played boxing like a few times in a row
yeah okay the boxing yeah I gotta get give that to you that definitely does
tell you figure out actually how to play the boxing game realize that all you
just flick your wrist and shut up Loki no but um no I think that's a pretty
cool idea I mean I'd probably rather play that than hop on the treadmill or
lift a bunch of weights you know or something Frisbee asks but what person
is gonna put play Twilight Princess in a hotel workout room well I don't think
that'll be one of the games that's on it because they said you can't put discs in
here so I'm assuming it's going to be games like you know we sports and we fit
in the more active type games yeah I don't if it's gonna be in the workout
room why would they put Twilight Frisbee in our chat also says just put a DDR
machine in there that's that's true why not idea DDR has been around for what 10
years now you haven't heard about that going into workout rooms although DDR is
kind of gone into the mainstream in other places such as school physical
fitness programs we've heard a lot about yeah it's kind of interesting yeah that's
really not a bad how about DDR on the Wii that's like you know workout times
too yeah right totally I think it's also uber lame me you were not a fan of DDR
on the Wii it's stupid it's like oh hey you remember how much how awesome hands
and feet mode was in the PlayStation 2 DDR's yeah let's bring that to the Wii
simple do with the Wii remote oh guess what it still sucks that's right I
didn't think it was that bad oh crap because it's randomly thrown in there
just for the fuck of it and you look like an idiot doing that you don't have
to play with that in there I understand that you know so they'll have to play
with hands and feet mode but the thing is a couple things that was disappointing
about one you couldn't add up your own edit steps using the hands and feet mode
or you know the Wii remote and stuff like that and to just their placement
in the songs as they were it's just kind of random so I don't know it just didn't
really flow with the song at all so all right it was just like hey look you're
burning more calories awesome yeah I do want to say one other thing about this
story before we move on the Westin workout is only going to be at 10 hotels
across the United States I mean obviously there's workout rooms and all
their hotels I'm sure but this we think is only in 10 hotels for now so I'm
assuming it's in the big cities in New York San Francisco whatever I'm assuming
this will roll out slowly to more and more hotels if it's successful but we'll
see because totally I'm not gonna stay at a hotel unless it has the Wii there
well you know if you got a big family maybe those are types of things you look
for or how about this I don't know if you're vacationing how about you just go
outside and go visit places of interest and get your exercise that way and stay
up like hey let's go to a hotel and go exercise in their exercise room okay
can't do that at home imagine you're a big you're gonna have kids someday Loki
you got married right and you're gonna have kids someday that's the long-term
plan and my kids will understand how retarded shut up hold on is the thing is
is that you're gonna be going out and let's say you know you go on a trip to
Disneyland or whatever you're gonna be out at Disneyland all fucking day you
and Ellie are gonna be tired as hell when you get back to the hotel and
you're gonna want to go just die you know in the couch and watch TV or
whatever but the kids they have energy nothing but energy so what better than
for them to go to the workout room and burn some more of that energy yeah
because the kids totally want to go to the workout room I can remember when I
went to Disneyland I was like hell let's go to the workout room this would be so
awesome instead of like hey let's go down the arcade downstairs or I don't
know hey let's go out to the pool I go around some or hey let's go run around
or hey how about we play some video games on the TV there I hope your kids
are twice as angry as you they're seriously gonna go are they fucking
serious they want us to go work out downstairs are you fucking crazy you
call me I'll be like shut up Billy you're only five you can't talk back to
me like that you're grounded I hope you really do name your kid Billy okay this
is great act deaf thank you act deaf just backing me up here a little bit act
deaf says Loki this is probably made for busy businessmen and women that go to
places but not actually visit the place excellent point oh so it says in the
press release oh well that makes all the difference why don't they just get some
work done instead and like okay I do this I'm a business traveler I go teach
in other places sometimes I haven't done it for a while sometimes I go to LA or
I go to you know wherever and I don't get put up at the Westin but if if I was
the president of the company I might okay I might actually get a kick out of
this all right fine go get a kick out of this I hope it's worth all the thousands
of dollars that they probably had to pay for it to be exclusive there or I'm
done I'm done I want to move on new subject well another disappointing idea
was the idea to remove clovers credits from the Okami we version not surprised
that clover has been kind of getting the shaft ever since you know they were
disbanded but kind of that he said shaft yes I said shaft that's right shaft so
you know it's not a big surprise that with the Wii version of the game coming
out hell let's just get it even sloppier and other than putting watermarks on our
covers let's just remove their they didn't really work on the game it's all
Capcom according to the new game now as I understand it their defense for taking
out the thing was that well clovers not around anymore and the logo was in this
movie file that we couldn't get the logo out of so we took out the whole movie
file that was their defense they couldn't get the logo out of the movie
file yes because they did not have the raw movie file from clover because
clovers gone wow that was there I swear to god I'm not making out that was the
excuse wow that's pretty retarded hell I could get the movie file from just a
fucking video of it it's called script print screen folks print screen you put
the movie file up and you take a screen capture and then you can crop it down of
course I guess you wouldn't know how to do that since you came fucking find a
picture without a watermark it's just fucking lazy whiz Capcom gotten really
lazy lately I mean seriously you know with all the fucking Megaman games and
shit that they've got coming out in Street Fighter remakes and fucking
remakes of other games do they have an original idea left with them I mean
seriously whatever it's Okami it's been out before buy it now because you're a
whore and you'll buy these stupid remakes if there is nothing different
with the game other than it's ad waggle so I hope you enjoy your fucking ps2
port that really had that rant had nothing to do with the credits getting
cut well it sucks for clover because God hand was awesome
Okami haven't played it comments from chat any any quick thoughts rice
princess before we go to chat not at all awesome for a chat says clover got
shanked on that deal they made the game they went out of business but WTF they
should still get the credit act-def says Capcom were lazy siren says Capcom
quickly make Marvel vs. Capcom 3 chat orange on radio calm okay I'm just just
so you know they have on joystick an actual video that was part of the end
credit sequence you know with clovers no logo in there and for one I don't see
why they couldn't just I don't know keep that video sequence since it's pretty
badass looking anyways but still though they can't do a screen capture of this
thing I just that boggles my mind sorry Rama says in chat Loki some of us missed
it the first time around okay great you know I'm sorry that you missed it the
first time around maybe you should I don't know keep up with games that are
coming up you're so rude what if somebody doesn't have a PlayStation 2
and they couldn't play it the first time around well then boo-hoo go to a
friend's house all right I don't know what see okay I'm going to tell you what
I'm going to I'm going to make a capture of the logo I'm going to do the
impossible just look at me I'm fucking David Copperfield pulling out you know
impossible feats all right have fun let's go to me oh look at this whoa
look at that I made a screen capture oh I'm fucking awesome oh that must have
been really hard dude seriously they have people like working there they're
complete idiots I guess so I mean with you know shit sliding through like the
watermark all right moving on talking about other we news it's a pretty
exciting developments in the virtual console world especially if you are in
the PAL regions meaning you know Europe and the like if you're in the PAL
regions the return of the Hanabi festival is coming Hanabi festival
happened a few months ago and it was like Japanese games all month and we got
something similar over here they didn't make a festival out of it but we started
getting some Japanese games well guess what they're getting overseas on the
virtual console they're going to get a final soldier columns 3 grottiest to
let's see star proteur Puyo Puyo to Cho Aniki is also scheduled to come out and
if you don't know what Cho Aniki is you're just gonna have to look it up on
Wikipedia or something to understand its awesomeness awesomely badness that's
pretty cool I want more Japanese games I like the last set of games they had that
came out like the real Super Mario Brothers 2 and stuff like that how are
they gonna sell Cho Aniki that's what I want to know let's throw it on there
Bill look it's an import game buy it I don't know well it's all part of the
upcoming festival for PAL regions so enjoy well mother fans are gonna like
this earthbound has been now rated by the ESRB for the Wii virtual console so
you can uh you know actually get to play mother to here pretty soon and no word
on yet when it's coming out but probably pretty soon since it just hasn't been
rated and of course there are some other games other than earthbound that have
been rated as well some of these including super dodgeball which is not a
big surprise since I believe dodgeball brawlers is coming out here on the DS
pretty soon samurai showdown 2 metal slug and Donkey Kong Country 3 Rob what's
that you need to get earthbound and you actually should finish it I should I I
do love earthbound you know I don't know why I just because I always rented the
game I never actually owned the game I always rented it and they never just I
always ran out of time to finish it but I love it totally like an adult and
you've been one for like a long time so you shouldn't like go well you're
totally like a bitch and you've been one for a long time so you should like it
you should like actually finish games Rob I know it's I have look I've told
the listeners about this before I have gaming a DD I start a game and then
another game comes out and I go shiny and I throw the other game at a deep
dark closet and I start playing the new game and then something else comes out
and it's a cycle I've total gamer a DD and by the way he means World of
Warcraft yes that old game but he throws into the closet not even this is you
know what not even necessarily World of Warcraft me I haven't played it and you
know I took like a week and a half off the game so you know once in a while you
know I go into console mode or whatever so I know that's kind of sad I've kind
of drifted from consoles in the past few years I used to be like totally pro
console and like kind of sort of anti PC but now it's kind of switched I'm not
anti console but I just don't play console but the only PC game you're
playing is World of Warcraft and puzzle pirates my bad yeah this is why World of
Warcraft doesn't come out for consoles it's it's keeping PC gaming alive it is
PC gaming I should say I'm gonna get angry emails from PC gamers and there
well there obviously is much more but obviously World of Warcraft is the
behemoth you can't deny that but there are games come to come in on the turn
pack like spore that are gonna be the same thing so you know we're probably I
don't know like this isn't in the show role because I couldn't find the actual
story for it but I mentioned this to you last night how that they have found a
way now since you know they've completely ripped apart the virtual
console they know how to pirate all the games now and stuff now they figured out
how to put games into the virtual console I heard about this how does it
work basically with you know it's kind of like the Xbox 360 and how they
emulates the Xbox games each virtual console game has an emulator built in
with it so what they're basically doing is keeping the emulator in there and
then stripping out the ROM and throwing another ROM in there so it would run off
that emulator and so it works on they've done it with pilot wing 64 Smash
Brothers and some other stuff but I was thinking you know hey you know the
potential for this you can Guardian legends you could do you know Super
Mario RPG pretty much anything that's on the virtual console and they've done it
like I think they've extracted ROMs or put ROMs from other games that are on
other regions into the u.s. ones I think basically just I don't know what'll
happen is you'll see the logo and stuff for whatever game it originally was
because I haven't figured out how to change that yet but with the rate that
they're going right now that won't be long but it's just it's very interesting
how much they've before this was all secure and now it's just poof like night
and day just cracked completely open but uh you know I'm looking forward to like
Guardian legend or something blaster master or something like that on a to
put blaster master on my Wii be awesome oh man but are you worried that there's
going to be a Nintendo patch that comes out that shuts this whole thing off and
possibly bricks consoles that did it I don't think that they can do that worry
brick consoles and the other thing too is it's going to be hard for them to
detect this stuff because they can see they can detect what virtual console
games you you have bought they know that but like if you say for example pirate
one of these games and throw it on there it doesn't detect that it's actually on
the console it's just data that's on there so it would be hard for them to do
that and also who's to say that you couldn't buy legitimate game like by you
know Super Mario Brothers 2 or something like that and then go back delete that
inject something into the Super Mario Brothers 2 file so it still looks like
you have Super Mario Bros 2 but really is like guardian legend or something so
I mean I don't know it's just interesting
totient and chat says injecting ROMs is lame by the damn virtual console titles
thanks well what if they're not out yet what if you keep waiting for me you just
don't want to wait and who's to say that you couldn't buy them later on when they
actually come out but now you're playing them it'll be interesting to see how
long it takes Nintendo to cut this off frisbee says Mario RPG anyone totient
says then buy them when they get out so I guess that would be okay moving on to
non virtual console related things and talking about other types of games for
the Wii and yes we play Xbox 360 and ps3 too it just so happens a lot of we news
this week boogie is apparently going to be getting a sequel boogie superstar has
apparently been slated for October it's been spotted on some websites out there
for shopping I guess like game I don't know they don't say exactly where but
I'm assuming it's either like game flyer game stop one of those October 14th is
apparently going to be the release date boogie the first one wasn't really that
critically heralded but I guess it did okay out there in the marketplace I
imagine the engine since it's been built it's probably not that hard to inject
new songs and I know there's a new my sims game coming out they saw some
details on it's like my sims mmm I say like medieval fantasy or something like
that it's like said in medieval times but it sounds just like Animal Crossing
now like they're ripping that off big time oh well won't be long speaking of
games like boogie completely random tangent karaoke revolution because I was
thinking about games where they don't change a lot from game to game but the
song list karaoke revolution right you remember that game okay I saw a movie
this week baby mama which was like you know I think was like the number one
movie the box office last week I'm sure it's not anymore thanks to Ironman but
you know baby mama came out karaoke revolution is like a plot device in the
movie it's there's actually like a whole scene where they're playing karaoke
revolution together and kind of like I don't want to spoil it but you know kind
of bonding over karaoke revolution they're actually like explaining how to
play the game and I'm like is this product placement like that's what it
felt like to me I'm like the Konami by product placement in this movie or is
this really like just that much a part of pop culture and I was thinking well
why did they not use sing star hmm conspiracy I don't know but I thought
that was actually kind of interesting have you played boogie I have not played
boogie I've seen videos online I've heard from friends about it that's it I
actually played boogie at a mutual friend's birthday party it was kind of
it was okay I mean there was nothing special about it it was I mean it was
just like karaoke revolution I think I there was like something where you can
make a music video of it or you can like edit you know the words or something
like that like to make it fancy but it's it kind of felt like something that was
more palatable to two kids or something I don't know I don't know why as a lot
of Wii games are yeah but I don't know I just didn't I wasn't thinking like oh
this game needs a sequel they should make one you know when I played it so I
think that's kind of weird but whatever I guess it was they got enough money
from it so all right well sequel coming soon well something that's a little bit
different that's being tested out right now in the Wii homebrew community is USB
mass storage support and they just released the source code for USB mass
storage device demo which right now only handles basic error handling and just
some basic features but eventually what they're hoping to do with this is allow
the USB support from the console to be able to use like memory sticks flash
drives mp3 players you know and fat formatted USB hard drives and I don't
know very interesting that you know kind of like what we saw with the PSP where
they're adding features to the system that aren't yet available kind of solve
some of the problems with the system and then probably will be added later on by
Nintendo type thing kind of like what Sony did with like the music radio
players and stuff like that on their system they went ahead and kind of saw
what the homebrew community is doing and followed it up with their own they
really do need to add mass storage to the Wii that's hurt seriously I should
have had more forethought on that but I guess they were trying to keep the price
down so bad but seriously seriously how much does like 512 I would think one
patch and they could fix that I mean if homebrew can do it why can't the Wii
roll out a patch to support it I think because they're just stupid well also
good reason well also because the way they've got it formatted in like blocks
I don't I mean I guess they could still do that but it's you know I don't know
it's just it's no easily you know what I actually just was kind of screwing
around one night and like I have a little mini SD card in my cell phone and
I actually copied a Wii file like I copied the Mario Brothers channel just
for giggles I copied it's in my card and it worked like I didn't have to format
my card for blocks it's mixed in there with pictures I take them on my cell
phone and everything else so it's like I have Mario Brothers in my pocket
everywhere I go but you know it's just kind of messing around seeing if it
will work and it did you didn't have to like format the card specifically for
blocks I don't know it's just it's really lazy that's what it is hmm well
we'll see who knows maybe we'll get a patch in the future especially they want
people to keep buying the WiiWare games they want us to redownload it every time
do the weed out we downloads things really slow sometimes I don't know if
it's just me but sometimes that channel is god-awfully slow and downloading
things especially if you haven't used the Wii in a while I don't know some
other games that are coming out soon for the Wii they're gonna have some pretty
interesting connectivity Ghostbusters you know it's coming out soon here's the
thing is that a red fly the development team behind the Wii version of the game
they're also doing the PlayStation 2 version just you know in the Wii version
you're actually going to be able to use the DS wirelessly no you can't well this
this is what's being reported well yes he came out reported here really it yeah
unfortunately that was something that was rumored to be happening you know
came out and said no that's not gonna happen who said that they actually came
out and said no this was a rumor they did oh I would've been so awesome it
would be an awesome idea and that's why exactly it wouldn't work because it
would be something smart and unfortunately they can't do something
smart because that would be wrong well I guess this is all you get then for cool
news about the Ghostbusters game and it's kind of borderline cool I guess
Bill Murray's coming back as old as he is to do the Ghostbusters lines he's
actually going to be in the game he's recording lines for the game so Bill
Murray will be in it I don't know I'm kind of I'm kind of given take on Bill
Murray he's okay but I love Rushmore like if you've seen that movie from
years ago he was great in that movie but lost in translation put me to sleep so
I'm indifferent I'm Bill Murray there you have it yeah it's in fact here's the
story here according to it's not actually the company he said the red
factor whatever it is it's a company called terminal reality is the one
behind it he says I'm sorry to report unfortunately this is not a feature of
the Wii and DS version of the game it would have been really cool though and
that's from terminal reality boss I agree it would be really cool fix it
delay the game make it soon it's I mean did you say make it so no I didn't yes
you did there was a member there is also that story a long time ago that they
were gonna do head tracking with you know boom blocks but from what I hear
and what I kind of gathered the reason they didn't do that is because Nintendo
stopped it because they don't want people there is a story they don't want
people moving a lot in their games cuz they're worried I guess that they're
gonna get injured or something but it's almost like they they can't won't allow
developers to do something innovative unless it's Nintendo's idea type thing
you know to me then we'll we'll roll out the enhancements to your gameplay and
then you just follow suit fucking lame interesting but this kind of goes back
to a story that we talked about a couple weeks ago actually that whole pole
dancing Wii game it's really being worked on it seriously is a peekaboo
pole dancing now if anything I thought was a joke it was this so this is kind
of shocking to me this is the basically a rep for peekaboo and the licensing
agency at 18 new media Simon K this is where they have to say peekaboo will be
all about fun and fitness for new generation peekaboo wants to make
fitness benefits for aerobic pole dancing accessible to millions of we
users robick pole dancing actually have pole dancing classes you can take it I
know my friend is a good pole dancing party friend did you know no no because
you know there's a pool right there you I'm good thank you the goal is to I
would play this game the goal is to encourage men and women of all shapes
and sizes to improve their pole dancing skills hey don't be sexist men can pole
dance to privacy our own homes looking to improve their pole dancing skills
while having fun toning up and burning calories ultimately peekaboo and 80 new
media want to do for pole dancing what guitar hero did for rock and roll okay
flash forward to a year from now okay here's here's a conversation that's
actually going to happen like a year from now okay hey Rob where did you get
those washboard abs I was playing peekaboo pole dancing that's what they
should put at the Westin okay oh my god okay here's my thing with this okay this
is never going to work I mean how the hell are they going to really this is
really happening there really really is going to be really going to do this
really really is not a joke I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't said uh no
because I mean they ever happened to the seal of quality this right here it will
yeah seriously what did happen to the seal of quality no this right here though
is going to be so bad I mean granted it's not obviously it's not going to be
a sexual game whatsoever but the fact that you put you know oh it's a game
with us it's teaching you to be a stripper you know that's the spin that
they're going to put on this shit I don't know it's just there was nothing
said about stripping it's aerobic pole dancing there was nothing said about
stripping yeah I participate in aerobic pole dancing and her I should say my
wife participates in aerobic pole wow nice that's hot okay so is it just
because they're trying to focus on aerobic games or games that get you
moving it is a bad idea it really is a bad idea it's stupid like honestly how
the hell are they gonna do this first off people are gonna you know from what
I gather this stuff is pretty hard I mean it's not like something you can
just go we're just gonna swing around on a pole and stuff you know you got to be
pretty you know in shape to do this kind of crap people are gonna be falling on
their fucking heads I mean it's not like the Wii balance board where you just
stand there kind of lean to the side this is like fucking crazy shit I mean I
don't know is it actually gonna come with a pole I think it's gonna come with
a pole because this company they make like a stripper pole that you can buy
they had they sell them at like fucking Spencer's nice so why do you think I
understand how this would work because even okay just a bad idea aside how the
hell are they gonna implement this cuz that's what I was gonna ask like you
what are you gonna have like you know like buttons on this thing or something
is it gonna sense your movement it I don't it doesn't seem like it would work
they're like throwing a concept out there and like okay couple someone make
this please because we can't think of a way to do it I just don't see them this
is not gonna be it working I don't know people will buy it because it's weird I
know that but which will come first Final Fantasy 13 or peekaboo pole
dancing pull dancing so do you think they chose the Wii console because of
the fact that it has like a sensor bar and they might incorporate because it's
your fitness driven words you know and honestly the Wii has gotten into a lot
of you know family homes where there's what the women are playing the Wii you
mean like housewives moms like strippers yeah strippers yeah well I don't think
strippers need to play this stripping game though or the I mean the excuse me
aerobic pole dancing yeah I think they do that every night home and take their
work home with them or anything so I don't think they're part of the
demographic but you know like you know wives who want to try to feel special
for their husband and want to be sexy for their house oh sweetie sit down I'm
gonna do something special for you and they like turn on the Wii it's like
you're kidding dude most guys would be happy that their wives are playing video
games in the first place but a pole dancing video game that's like I do see
the positives in that yeah I guess like all you have to add to that is her
bringing you a beer and cooking your ribs for dinner and you're set oh that's
it yeah that's it perfect yeah I don't know it's just maybe April Fool's joke
that won't die yeah all right well these are not a joke it's the upcoming release
dates Jamie's not here tonight so I'm gonna cover Europe for your eyes for you
guys there's really not a lot anyway on May the 9th boom blocks finally makes
its way in Europe to the Nintendo we also come into the Wii Dragon Quest
swords the masked queen in the Tower of Mirrors that's that whole game where you
can actually use the Wii as the sword we played that here the Japanese version
long time ago did it ever come out here in America yes no I just missed it came
out back in February oh my bad Apollo justice ace attorney is also making its
way the Nintendo DS on May the 9th over in Europe and that's really it I guess
they figure most you guys are too busy playing Grand Theft Auto yes this week in
the u.s. it's gonna be actually weirdly enough mostly Wii games starting off
with us well this is not just only on the Wii but Speed Racer that's gonna be
coming out on both the Wii and the DS this week SNK arcade classics volume 1
coming out on the PSP this week baseball mogul 2009 coming out on the PC see here
chameleon on the PSP it's kind of like a tile based puzzle game there's brain
voyage on the DS another brain training game on Nintendo's brand new DS game
Nintendo crosswords DS that's coming out as well there's also Dog Island on the
Wii whoopee-doo it's it's probably the cutest Wii game out there do you get a
bazooka and Dog Island I don't know I kid I kid but you run around as dogs a
giant heads boom blocks that's coming out on the Wii also our type command
it's coming out on the PSP there's some pretty cool pre-order bonus with that
too I think Call of Duty 4 is getting the game of the Year Edition finally on
PlayStation 3 and see here I think that's pretty much it oh I thought this was
still coming out but I think you may have moved again was it a blast works
supposed to come out on the Wii I thought but I think it moved I don't know last works I'm really looking forward to hope that doesn't suck I would do Japanese
release dates about this time but there is seriously nothing coming out in Japan
this week at least on the calendar I have the next wave of games is not till
the 15th which will be next week you have luminous arc 2 on the DS to look
forward to next week on the 15th but that as far as this week goes you're
gonna have to play the games you already have nothing new coming out in Japan
sorry Japan where we're all no one gets excited and so we kind of teased this
earlier when we decided not to go to e3 because of the ESA membership not
because we weren't invited or anything just because you know we said I was on
Bobby show where that happened by the way not this show whatever Bobby
Blackwell five o'clock on all games whatever we're not going now but anyways
Activision and video have discontinued their ESA membership and you know also
kind of going along with that they are not going to be at e3 so according to
ESA is rich Taylor's senior vice president communications and research he
says we can confirm the Activision of it then bindi games I thought it was
Activision Blizzard but you know I could be wrong opted to discontinue their
membership the ESA remains dedicated to advancing our industry's objective as
protecting intellectual property preserving First Amendment rights and
fostering the benefits our beneficial environmental environment for the entire
industry I guess you don't really have any offensive games or anything so they
don't really need them to defend their rights for anything or you know at the
same time I guess they don't really have to participate in their you know
defending the rights of gamers and gaming industry because they're doing it
for other people it's still kind of loops them in there it's kind of like
going along for a free ride type thing says uh let's see while the
Entertainment Software Association remains the permanent voice for the US
computer and video game publishers we can confirm that Activision and video
games opted to discontinue the membership and blah blah blah it's
interesting so why'd they do it that's the question of the week it doesn't say
I think they're just being cheap you think well think about it I mean if
you're you know a group of companies or whatever and you're paying the ESA to
say defend you from these you know laws out there that are you know trying to
prevent like say M rated games being sold to anybody or you know calling
games porn stuff like that if you say drop out of this you know organization
this organization is still working for other companies to do that defend them
against other things instead now they have less money to work with that's
really the only downside but they're still fighting for you it's just you're
not paying them you're kind of just sitting there you know it's like your
friends all chipping for pizzas like oh that's cool I'm not really hungry right
now and later on you know oh there's some pizza left over so you start you
know scoffing down a piece well you're just a freeloader yeah it still affects
them regardless of whether they're a member of the USA or not so they why
would they just pay to do that you know and also do they really make any games
that would be affected by any kind of law publicity Activision probably not
because I think they mainly just you know Call Duty 4 is probably the
riskiest thing that they have but that's not even really that bad probably not I
don't think you know there are a lot of movie licenses and yeah Tony Hawk and
yeah that's actually pretty smart on their part there you know they're gonna
be saving a but it's not cheap it's just you know I don't know I think act
deft and chat makes the comment a lot of people I've kind of seen have been
making this week screw e3 packs is where it's at yeah well e3 is kind of its
beginning its decline yes yeah like there's nothing special about e3 anymore
nobody cares about it I think the appeal you think these company actually missed
the old e3 it's possible yeah I don't know because a lot of the comments I've
seen or theories on it is they got tired of e3 being kind of a pissing contest of
who who's flashier who's you know doing bigger things and stuff like that and so
now they weren't getting business done and they're just you know it's a kind of
a waste of time for them whereas I don't know like something like packs they have
people that are interested in their product they can you know it's their
target audience I guess and they're still getting the press releases out
there and also now that they've figured out that they can do these gamer days
and no press events like that was my thought exactly it the whole press comes
out for gamers day at the all these gamers day stuff why why bother anything
well you know what I mean bastards of the elite press that we didn't get
invited to e3 either so you know whatever but they they get into these
things so why bother with e3 and exactly and it doesn't really matter the press
gets to see this stuff anyways cuz a lot of times they're just saying them
pre-release copies of these games anyways it really unfortunately press
isn't working the way it used to before where you know people are actually
reporting on things now they're working closely with these game companies and
the game companies are telling them how to report stuff and they're you know
going back and forth and making deals and that kind of thing it's really all
they're kind of like the press is in their pocket type thing nowadays but
does everybody wants to break exclusives yes everyone everyone wants their
exclusives and and fortunately we as we found out the hard way you know that
goes to the people that can make the you know deals say hey I'll tell you what
we'll give you a premium advertising for your game on our website if we can break
this exclusive on the story and and they will just literally you know tell you
one thing oh yeah everyone's gonna get the story at the same time and just boof
it gets you know out there and they're like oh well sorry I thought everyone's
on the same page about this kind of stuff really right it's it's just you
know they follow the money well they are business people so I would love to see
an underground blog come out that just outs all these things you know what I
mean before the company's buy-in if it's possible it might be I don't know I
don't know got the comments from chats shadow Charlie simply says fuck e3 we do
says e3 was a sensation that grew too out of control I don't know I would
think maybe some people kind of miss the glam that comes with e3 because boy that
show got a lot of press coverage a lot a lot of press coverage and now the tone
down one not quite as much you know maybe amongst the hardcore gamers sure
but amongst the general public not so much I don't know and I and they're like
saying I know their excuses that we've heard before we're just like oh it's
hard you know for us to make demos and stuff for for these events and it really
interferes with our production schedules and stuff like that I haven't really
noticed an issue over the last like 10 years or whatever that you know these
have been you know probably even longer that these have been going on so I think
that's just an excuse I think they're just looking the ways to save money
because nowadays I don't know if they're not making as much money or maybe the
margins are smaller but cutting costs any way they can and a glamorous event
like e3 that's definitely inexpensive they can probably do without well guess
what Activision Vivendi are not the only ones who have decided to skip e3 this
year that's what makes the story even more interesting and see soft foundation
9 and Atlas have all also opted out of this year's e3 this has been confirmed
by other attendees as well kind of interesting foundation 9 game spotters
reported foundation 9 is out because quote we just didn't feel like we got
enough out of the investment last year in order to justify the expense this
year that is telling me that sounds like a quote where somebody sounds like they
miss is the old e3 not getting enough exposure whereas the old e3 was all
about you know yes it was a little bit sensationalistic but think about all of
that exposure yes you had people at e3 that may may or may not have been there
but they get the word out and they're they're loving all the stuff they see
because it's e3 everybody's pumped every game you play is awesome what they've
changed from you know years past they've gotten rid of like the Kenshia Hall
where you had all the independent game companies and stuff down there were
people you know after they visit all the other booths and stuff they just go down
there and check out a lot of these games that don't normally get press you'll see
a lot of stuff down there that's pretty amazing that will eventually get picked
up by a company and stuff and if they would get a lot of foot traffic a lot
more than they would get you know if they just had a booth at this new e3 you
know because from what I heard there was you know obviously before there was a
lot of traveling in between hotels and stuff like that a lot of more of a
strict schedule so it's a lot less time to kind of explore it at your own pace and
that probably also the decreased foot traffic kind of hurt them a little bit
because when you have a lot of stories to cover and stuff a lot of the
independent media doesn't get to cover these you know smaller companies and
that kind of sucks.
Alright well also some other speculation going on around the internet about
exactly why this is all going down this week which is probably the biggest thing
to happen this week. Kotaku managed to get the organizer of the Penny Arcade
Expo to comment on this. This is from Robert Koo who's the director of
business development for the Penny Arcade Expo quote, the reason that E3 imploded
in recent years was because the publishers felt that it turned into this
sort of pissing contest between them where they were trying to figure out who
could one-up each other.
They all thought to themselves that it just wasn't worth it. I would imagine
that the show is still trying to look out for what the publishers want. That's
the whole goal of the trade association which is to deliver the needs and try to
figure out what their members actually want. So there you have it. More
speculation as to why E3 may be shrinking. It's going to be very
interesting to see what happens in kind of the coming weeks as more you know
kind of gets out. I'm curious if this is going to be the start of a mass
exodus or what's going to happen. You may see that because member E4all, same
kind of thing happened there with big companies saying oh we're not
going to be a part of this. Microsoft and Sony both pulled out of that didn't they? I think so
yeah. You think these companies might go to E4all instead? No. I don't think
they will. I think they'll do their own because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo
don't really need these kind of events anyways because they have their own big
events. In fact one we'll be talking about in some last minute stories, the
PlayStation day. They invite the press out for that kind of stuff and I
know Microsoft has their own conference and same with Nintendo so there's really
no reason that they need to be a part of E3. I mean especially if it's going to
cost them a lot more money. I'm sure they would like the press for it and stuff
but I don't know. I still miss the I would hate it if they didn't you know
show up because I miss their press conferences. That's my favorite part you
know hearing all their cool new things. Although Nintendo last year is kind of
disappointing with those we zapper and we wheel dumb ideas but whatever. Anywho
back on a different subject here. Prince of Persia. Well we talked a little bit a
few weeks ago that there was gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming
out. The brand new game is I guess gonna be just called Prince of Persia and not
some sort of Prince of Persia prodigy or whatever but it's scheduled to be
released on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It will be a prequel to the previous Prince
of Persia series and I believe is gonna be a trilogy as well so it's supposed to
introduce I guess an illustrative art style and I guess the DS is also getting
their own Prince of Persia game but it's gonna be exclusive to that console and
will be its own unique storyline. So pretty cool hmm and they actually I
found I think I found some scans there was a magazine was it it was a joy pad
it's a magazine that had some pictures and it looks pretty cool actually it's
like almost not really cel-shaded but sort of I don't know how I would really
describe that. What do you think about this Rob here real quick and I'll link the
chat room to these scans as well. It's you know I'm not surprised that Prince of
Persia continuing especially you know they have this movie coming out I'm a
little bit surprised they're kind of relaunching it as a you know kind of
spin-off series or what have you but you know if they're gonna do that that's
probably why they're trying to change the look of it and everything so why not
Prince of Persia has always been a solid game I think the best way to describe it
Prince of Persia series is very solid line of games so you know what the heck
but that's an interesting art style I think oh yeah looks like like Okami ish
I don't know yeah I guess it would be like a cross between Okami and say like
I don't know just like a normal like action game it's like I don't know it's
really hard to describe it it's a 3d game with like inclines on the outside I
guess anyways I'll link it in the chat room it's on a website action trip calm
so all right well in other news clock tower you remember this game long time
ago it was out on the PlayStation can you describe what happened in clock
tower you were a girl I don't remember the specifics of it I guess she got like
locked into a towers or I know it was like a house or something a mansion and
basically the objective was for you to hide from this like crazy huge scissor
welding guy and he would like you would be walking around like the rooms inside
of the mansion or whatever and he would hear like music or your heartbeat I
don't remember exactly I played it a long time ago but you would know somehow
that he was coming so you had to like hide from him and then he would come
through and like it would be really tense because you don't know if he'd
find you or not because he kind of like he'd walk by he'd sometimes he'd like
look behind stuff or whatever and so that was kind of the big thing about it
I saw this game like one time this game was a trip from oh my god scary it's
almost scarier than like Silent Hill and some of those yeah no it's like it's
tense it was brutal too if he found you snap your head got cut off yeah that's
part of the whole tension of it is like oh crap he's gonna find me you know like
yeah but it was good it was good well they're making a movie out of it I
can't wait that's gonna be freaky variety is reported this and there's
been rumors of a clock tower movie for quite a long time what variety is
reported this week that senator entertainment is going to be producing
it Weinstein company is putting it out you know that's they used home your max
and all that stuff the guy who wrote borderland Eric poppin is writing the
script the folks who produced the hills have eyes to producing this I don't know
so much about that Marco Weber and Martin wise so it should be it sounds
like it'll be at least if nothing else what a good horror film you know like
the kind of like a cheap cheesy film you know I want it to have some substance in
it you know like I yeah even though it is a video game movie like I don't I
want them to actually do something with it all right we'll see what happens well
you know because this week was so big with a grand theft auto 4 people were
wondering well where is the PC version of the game and like you may remember
with the other ones it was a while after you know they came out that the PC
version finally made its way to the market of course rockstar is doing the
old no comment thing on the Grand Theft Auto for PC version but more than
likely it probably around at some point people are hoping that maybe by this
holiday will see it on the PC I don't see why they wouldn't mean that's more
sales for them and especially I imagine the PC version probably look a little
bit better to especially on some high-end pcs but there are some
publishers though they're still listing the game as being released on October
30th 2008 of course you know take two or rockstar has not announced the release
of that game or even the existence of the game so I don't know if it's any
consolation though the last three PC releases for Grand Theft Auto 3 Vice
City and San Andreas were all pretty quiet too so maybe there's a
possibility although I don't know if three was on the PC wasn't it oh yeah
Vice City was Vice City and actually I think three may have been on the PC I
don't remember but I know Vice City and San Andreas were all right well guess
what I've got for you guys here before we get to the end of part a yes it's
another stupid award for the week sadly this week it's it's not so gruesome I
guess it's actually good things we don't actually like people dying but this is
very stupid nonetheless happened in San Diego 27 year old robbed a GameStop he
actually pepper sprayed two employees and stole launch day copies of Grand
Theft Auto 4 however as the person who actually robbed the store Richard feel
is his name they actually have a little picture of him on the internet in the
back of the police car he found that real life is a little bit harder than
Grand Theft Auto because police actually found a copy of Grand Theft Auto they
they got him and they found a copy of Grand Theft Auto 3 and a PlayStation 3
controller in his pickup truck along with the stolen copy of Grand Theft Auto
4 here's the police department commented to the local NBC affiliate in San Diego
the call came out as a robbery of a commercial business and the suspect was
described in the vehicle truck that he got into was described as a white
Toyota pickup truck lifted with the tailgate down and our helicopter Abel
spotted the vehicle southbound the officers followed it so that was it no
word on how many stars he accumulated a comment from chat alpha canagram says I
bet Lord Voldemort paid that dude to do it of course load Lord Voldemort is our
other name for you know who probably paid him to do it anyhow if you're gonna
steal a game we just shouldn't steal a game stealing games is stupid it's been
he stole one game
it's just funny no you shouldn't steal at all it's it's very bad when you steal
hey we're gonna get somebody on the line here to do something special for you at the very very end of part a of our podcast because you know what happens at the end of part a of our show all the
time do two ringy dingys hi Jamie hey it's Rob orange lounge the show misses
you tonight how you doing you're dead I'm sorry to hear that did the guy from
clock tower kill you know no no I moved a lot of furniture yesterday and then
ran errands all day and then drove back gotcha well hey you know you know it's a
time it's we're at the end of part a finally we surprisingly rate ran long
tonight with not much gaming news and you know it's there's always a segment
that we do this part of the show so we had to bring you here to give us your
classic game of the week
your part of the show where we pay respect to our elders in gaming with
Jamie picking out a game from the long lost archives of games that folks should
really check out this week so Jamie what did you pick for the kids tonight I
picked out nothing that was obscure or crazy or weird or anything I picked out super mario brothers 3
why not a true classic one of my favorite games when it came out I went
completely crazy it was the only reason that I would see the other wizard to
begin with the game you know it was you know what super mario brothers 2 was
over here wasn't really super mario brothers 2 super mario brothers 2 was
more like the original was more like a rehash of the first game whereas 3
actually did some real innovations by having your different worlds different
things like that the whole point of it is the whole point was that formula that
everyone had become accustomed to and then blew it up really big so it was really cool
you had different worlds you had world 1 was grassland, world 2 was desert, 3 was seaside, 4 was big island, 5 was the sky
6 was iceland, 7 was pitanese, and 8 was castle kubak
each world had you know different maps that would go along with the theme of
whatever that world was but you also had different little mini fortresses that
you had to go through and then you had your primary thoughts with different ways of
beating them although a lot of them were just like a certain type of a different
pattern would fit like different ones those three I remember the bosses the
bosses were all pretty easy if you just keep stomping on their heads repeatedly
and don't let him get don't let him get any moves on you well now remember you
have the ones that were on the rocking platform oh that's true and then you
have and then you have the ones that were in the room that would shrink I
guess as long as you kept up your pattern it was easy
oh we have some boss model music in here well for the fortress music and this
you know what made this game super famous here's what I remember about
Super Mario Bros 3 this will always be my not only I believe is this the best
selling video game ever which makes it a true classic but this was the game that
was not originally packaged with the system oh that okay the way oh yeah
because obviously you know you have Super Mario Brothers is the pack and of
course that's gonna sell more technicality I remember this game for
being featured in the movie the wizard I think that was the motivation for a lot
of us was to see like the first sneak peek at Super Mario Bros 3 remember the
guy introducing it in the movie he made it sound all like holy it's great and
now we're like yeah but the other thing that I thought was really cool about
that he was a different power-ups that you would get you had your usual
mushroom you had your fire flower but you also had the raccoon tail that you
could get that was always like my favorite to have ever you had your you
know your power stars we had you know all your other mushrooms the Tennessee
suit was fantastic because you could also turn into the monk statue and the
enemy who just ignore you for a little bit except you really didn't do that on
the donut level you don't anybody donut level where you'd run over the little
donuts and they would fall you can get on that level could you die but the
other cool thing about the Trinity students if you turn into the statue
while you're airborne you'll land on something and it'll kill it and it's
great you also get the peeling which was there's actually two items as a peeling
or an anchor and you get this out of some of the toad houses and it's like if
you collect a certain number of coins on even number world you would get the
anchor if you did it on the odd world and you would get a peeling or maybe
through the way around anyway so yeah it was that way um also on a couple of the
places you could get a hammer brother suit you could go hammers and there was
one fire brother that would um but you uh I'm being scared out by my husband
then says the anchor was worthless however to shoot rock the anchor was
worthless you know what I will tell you though you want piss me off about
power-ups Jamie okay go ahead that's why I was gonna say no no not just the fact
that it was there but what pissed me off you can only use that damn shoe in one
level I know you know what they should go ahead they should make a game for the
Wii called kuriboh shoe everybody would buy it that would be great well there
were some different levels between the American and Japanese version some were
changed for matters of just copy did it cause the game to glitch like in world
five there was in five one if you would have to go to a pipe to get to where the
screen goes black and white and it would actually cause the game to glitch up
pretty bad um also if you got hit in the Japanese version no matter what power
if you had you would go back to being small if whereas in the American one you
would just go to being super and then to be small except with the kuriboh shoe
which was you'd go back to being small in Japanese version but in American one
you just go back to whatever power-up you had then to super and then to small
and the music of the game was done by Koji Kondo who I got to meet and he's a
guy yeah and there were remakes there was the Satellaview version for Super
Famicom which is basically the enhanced version that looked like Super Mario All
Stars which again was another version and actually Super Mario All Stars had
the version that came out actually retained some of the stuff that was in
the Japanese version and not in the u.s. one we also got Super Mario Advance 4
Super Mario 3 which was pretty cool and had stuff added and you know I did spice
it up a little bit and that one was developed by Nintendo R&B 2 pretty cool
there were e-reader extra levels that would extend the game but they were
really convoluted and hard to do so it was like people just said I screw it and
didn't bother I don't even remember that they had Super Mario Brothers 3d the
Walmart cards and some that came with the game with might with Super Mario
Advance 4 that the extensions were for the advanced version but you had to have
the e-reader 2 GBAs a link cable and the card you wanted and you would hook up
the GBA with the cartridge and the connector will go in the e-reader and
then you would do all this convoluted crap and it was a big pain in the ass
and not I mean the levels were cool and it really opened up I think a lot of
potential to have you know almost infinite playability as long as people
are willing to put up with the crap you had to do to use the e-reader but other
than that you know of course the whole e-reader thing sort of died out once
they started upgrading the hardware very interesting very interesting comment
from Rama in chat Nintendo give us Super Mario Brothers 4 you know we never
really have had just a plain Super Mario Brothers games since Super Mario
Brothers 3 I mean sure there's been Mario World there's been countless other
games have had Mario in it but there's never ever been a Super Mario Brothers
4 I guess so but it was also you know down to the world down to powerups down
to all the specials and actually if I do remember right I think that you the
Super Mario World feather was actually the power-up and you could use that as
a power-up in Mario and Mario for advanced but I really think the world
could be considered I think it's just as they decided to stop numbering them
because it would get ridiculous and then fall into you know street fighter
formula true and hit stem points out that you also have the one on the DS that
really really if anything was like the closest thing we've had to Mario 3 in a
long time you know I mean that was oh yeah new Super Mario Brothers about
Mario advanced so yeah one four but yeah we didn't have that I guess and mean the
Mario and we had a lost levels not lost levels but the all-stars all right well
any other thoughts on the Super Mario Brothers 3 it was fun and I'm gonna
break out my my top loading Nintendo soon and play the hell out of it when I
don't feel like I'm gonna fall over and I just don't use whistles because you
know that's cheating no it's not cheating we are going to have a
discussion right here right now about using the work with those it's not
cheating it for a reason I know it's okay into the game it's not cheating but
you've got to admit so much more fun to play without warping you you don't get
to play big world if you war big world is the bomb I agree with that but you
can work to get ahead to get right to big you know you can go right there
that's only half cheating okay okay it was programmed into the game for a
reason and you know what you know what I had the same argument with people who
say oh you can't use speed ups on DDR either of like okay go back and play
beat mania without you know speed up it wasn't in the original all right fine
warp all you want but I want big world and the level with curry boshu they'll
program more all right all right Jamie we got to wrap up part a so we get to
part B or we'll be here all night all right any other quick things you wanted
to say to share with the listeners before you're back here next week I
really like fishy all right enjoy your sushi for lunch all right burp all right
take care Jamie okay bye Jamie she's being tired she sounds like she has a
lot of energy left in her she talked for 10 minutes about Mario Brothers 3 she's
very passionate about that game but it is it is probably one of like the best
games of all time I mean you can't deny that I absolutely can I absolutely yeah
I mean if there is any classic game I mean just because y'all happen to have
probably played this one doesn't make it a non classic game it had to be the
classic game of the week at some point totally there you have it all right well
that's going to do it for part a of our show so those you guys listening on the
podcast will be back in a few days but for those you guys listening live
tonight on www.allgames.com we'll be back in a few minutes with part B of our
show orange lounge radio is taped live on Sunday nights and it's podcast to the
world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this
