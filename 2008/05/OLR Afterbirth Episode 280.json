It's not resident evil though. It's Another game also happens to have dead things running around in January Dead rising coming through the wii yay, so that would be pretty cool. That could be interesting Also, they have a pretty strong lineup for the winner so far one that's been delayed bionic commando as actually now set in February Hopefully that sticks resident evil 5 in March and Street Fighter 4 in January Of course the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4 January. Yeah, well. There's another I read another story though From juice France those in the same thing. They said a winner release for it, so it fits so all right It's a good spot to put it. I mean cuz there's nothing comes out in January.

Do I'm gonna go to the bathroom a game. Thanks. We are hijacking the afterbirth officially Oh my god always does this Okay, okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on And this is what happens when women run show We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics we hate the scrolls they suck so bad and um and they suck They do suck and they turn green well. They are green, but they turn into other people And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a scroll for all we know half the chat room could be scrolled Andrew could be a scroll, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green. I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me The show makes me turn green. Scroll! Okay, act death protests and toshin protests and a bunch of people said that they're not scroll so that means they are You just want us to If you say you aren't a scroll, you are a scroll Do they weigh less than a duck? I mean we can find out And don't eat us cuz you can't become us Wait different universe. Sorry And cheeseburger if you have to ask it means you are one Yes, the Hulk does turn green actually the Hulk turns gray and red and He in one universe he eats people's brains damn the Patriots and poops them out I Just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to save his poo Because it had alien matter. No no it had alien rubber bands in it You know not what you just what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom I I keep comics in my bathroom everybody just die monster. You don't belong in this world I do okay the comics in my bathroom right now is that three volumes of the ultimates I? Have I'm sorry one And I know it's why exiles cuz it's awesome, and you suck. Why God why? Can I kill him ultimate volume one and two You're actually not supposed to like it supposedly if you like Marvel But it's actually better written than the actual Avengers ha ha ha I said it see how easily provoked Jamie is I? Actually have nothing against the ultimate series I Have everything against you though, so it's okay. I Know I know So if you're into comics if you were into the Iron Man movie there is a new invincible Iron Man series that came out Not this last week, but the week before you'll probably be able to find it in Your local comic book store. It's a good starting point for people who have Seen the movie and want to learn more about Iron Man, but have never read any of the comics the main villain so far is Jebediah stain who is the son of Obadiah stain the main villain from the Iron Man movie you'll see And you'll see roadie, and it's it's a very good comic a good writer good artist well Yeah, okay artist. I'm not too happy with art, but overall a good recommendation for a comic Rob has now been gone for five minutes and 45 seconds Five minutes have elapsed Another good comic this week was x-men divided we stand number two Which is one of the Messiah complex comics dealing with the x-men featuring? That's what you were reading earlier I have downloaded it and have yet to read it because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill Series that I'm waiting on to be finished My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a A contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill Happens I want to go to the best place ever you want to run off to Silent Hill. You'll have a killer good time Herman Herman head goes fast for tonight No He has to drag around that great knife So how was Mighty Avengers Mighty Avengers is very interesting because it's fantastic wasn't it it was more scroll tastic But it was more or less Bob is nuts the comic. Yeah basically another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe is the Captain Marvel short series Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many many years ago, but they brought him back And I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing But the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good And it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback I've been told to say something. I can't normally say around Rob. Okay, I Don't say whatever the fuck I want around Rob so maybe um What's something that really grosses Rob out kind of ritual sex There I said it he likes boobies All men like boobies. It doesn't matter if they're gay. Yeah, I remember one time at Disneyland What He only sucks if you pay him Only if you're female, sorry lalalala lalala lalalala lalalalala Lali lu they know I suggested that I say vagina I can say that around Rob though. We saw Margaret Cho. Hi This is a woman who's part of her stand-up comedy was about her period so no that doesn't work I I like what she said though. She said that if Richard Pryor had a period he would talk about it. How do you guy? now Well, you're not housing a hottie. How do you guy why not? Because I'm sitting down you should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can stop Oh, yes, I know what Rob doesn't like Rob doesn't like looking at girls butts He likes that song right yes nine minutes have elapsed You know what Rob lied to us he lied to me he's never coming back Probably right and he probably got into a car accident. The cake is a lie Given that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store And then you have to go in and get plates, and then you have to pay for plates You know what we should do we should go to grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake And go I guess guess what Rob you know that bet he's doing what he's buying a present He's getting you a Walmart gift card I should've told him to buy candles, and then you could all sing me happy birthday, and I could I'm doing it right now nine eight seven six five four three two one time My mommy just texted it at me. What'd your mom have to say happy Memorial Day tomorrow? I'm saying thanks mommy. Happy my birthday weekend and Happy DJ Ranma s birthday weekend time And happy Lenny Kravitz birthday weekend even though. I'm not really into any of his music Rob you're late Train wreck-a-rama we has Rex Metal Gear So I told Rob to get candles I Told Rob to get bent There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called love It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid the love of a staunch true man the love of a baby unafraid have Existed since time began, but the greatest of loves the quintessence of loves even greater than that of a mother It's the tender passionate infinite love of one drunken marine for another That's fantastic Rob is late late late late. Rob is late late late late 25 seconds You're a butt fire you Rob I could we could have used the dishes And I would have loaded the dishwasher But then you would have had to been here to like clean the dishes.
