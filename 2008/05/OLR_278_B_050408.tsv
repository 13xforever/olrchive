0	5700	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5700	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	27900	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.
27900	33500	But you're probably thinking to yourself, but hey, Rob, it's about 7.30 in the evening Pacific or 10.30 Eastern.
33500	43000	That's because it's time for part B of our podcast, which goes out to the podcast feed usually on Wednesdays, Thursdays if I'm having an especially busy week like last week.
43000	44000	So sorry about that.
44000	50400	Also this week, a bonus podcast, just a very, very short 10 minute little podcast will go out to the feed probably midweek,
50400	57500	probably before you hear this part B podcast listeners that actually will have the Grand Theft Auto finalists in it.
57500	70900	You know, we had that contest going on that ultimately rolls up into the All Games competition where we are actually going to be giving away a Grand Theft Auto for limited edition one and eight custom console Xbox 360 Elite.
70900	71900	It's going to be awesome.
71900	75700	And I played for you guys entry from an ineligible listener in part A.
75700	77900	So if you haven't heard part A yet, go back and listen.
77900	82400	For those of you listening live tonight on All Games Radio, you have about four hours left to get an entry in.
82400	84200	I'll tell you what, there's not a lot of competition.
84200	87700	So if you think you can come up with something creative pretty quick, do it.
87700	89400	You might win an Xbox 360 Elite.
89400	90200	It's going to be pretty awesome.
90200	93800	We'll let you know who is the finalist for Orange Lounge Radio next week.
93800	101300	And I think we'll know in like two, two and a half weeks who the ultimate winner is from AllGames.com, who's walking away with the one and eight Xbox 360 Elite.
101300	105700	Don't forget, just for being the Orange Lounge Radio finalist, you do get some prizes.
105700	113700	You get like a T-shirt and $25 gift certificate to the new All Games store that's up and running.
113700	114400	That's awesome.
114400	115400	Awesome.
115400	119500	All right, just for being silly and recording it for our mutual enjoyment.
119500	122300	All right, let's get back into some gaming news here on part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
122300	124200	Loki, take it away.
124200	126200	All right, let's see here.
126200	130900	Well, this is kind of interesting because I know they haven't been doing too well for the longest time.
130900	138000	But Atari is actually being bought up by Infogrames for $11 million.
138000	145700	And the announced, I guess, merger, they're going to buy the remaining stock of Atari, of course, for $11 million.
145700	151200	And that will immediately lend $20 million to the company before the deal closes.
151200	163400	And although it's hard to really say what's going to happen, although Infogrames only had 51.4 controlling interest in Atari, or 51.4%.
163400	170000	It looks like it doesn't really sound like what kind of changes are going to happen after this.
170000	176500	But I guess it's nice for Atari to have a little bit more financial backing.
176500	178000	Well, here's the thing, though.
178000	180300	Essentially, Atari has been sold for $11 million.
180300	181700	Is that what I'm going to understand?
181700	182100	Yeah.
182100	184600	I mean, $11 million is not that much money.
184600	185700	I mean, don't get me wrong.
185700	187000	I'd gladly take $11 million.
187000	189600	Our company that I work for could have bought Atari.
189600	190700	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
190700	194300	I'm like, dude, this is the company that is like my childhood.
194300	199400	You know, when I mean like little childhood, like when I was like three, was when the Atari 2600 was big.
199400	202200	But still, it's kind of weird to think that...
202200	203600	Why hasn't EA bought them?
203600	207400	I mean, they could have just like, seriously, it's just why I boof, snapped them up like nothing.
207400	216100	I mean, I know that they may not be interested in per se them, but a bigger portfolio is not a bad thing.
216100	218700	I mean, granted, it sounds like there's some other stuff involved here.
218700	220900	Like the whole, like they're loaning them $20 million and stuff.
220900	223300	So maybe it's not fair to say they're only getting sold for $11 million.
223300	226700	But still, that's kind of what it comes off as.
226700	228200	It's just kind of weird.
228200	233600	It'd be like if someone sold Nintendo 20 years from now for like, I don't know, $15, $20 million.
233600	234600	A bag of peanuts.
234600	238400	I mean, that would be like, it would be weird.
238400	244200	Of course, it was also weird to see the Sega logo on a Nintendo game like years ago when F-Zero came out.
244200	245500	It's all weird.
245500	246900	That is weird.
246900	248500	Sephiroth1215 in our chat room.
248500	250300	Chat.orangelauncherader.com says,
250300	253200	Too bad most Atari or Infogrames games suck.
253200	257500	The Dragon Ball Z games are good, but I'm really sick of them now because they just do the same thing every year.
257500	258800	I mean, I guess that is the sad thing.
258800	261300	Atari honestly hasn't had a lot going for it recently.
261300	262500	See, that would have been perfect.
262500	267700	You could have had Dragon Ball Z 2008 or 2009 for EA.
267700	270400	Although I have to admit, I did kind of want one of those flashback consoles.
270400	275100	I mean, it's not like I can't still get one, but you know, flashback consoles are cool.
275100	278600	So, I guess there you have it.
278600	285800	More to develop on that or more news on that, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, including what the joint projects will be in the future.
285800	288000	Let's talk about Qmotions.
288000	291100	They are a subsidiary of Actiga.
291100	292100	They're a gaming company.
292100	295400	They apparently have made some sort of agreement with Microsoft.
295400	303800	They're going to be using the wireless technology that Qmotions has for types of active gaming controllers for the Xbox 360.
303800	310000	Now, Qmotions has made these large controllers for like golf, baseball, and snowboarding.
310000	313500	I want to say, I've seen this before.
313500	315700	I want to say one of those times...
315700	317600	They sell them at Best Buy, I think.
317600	325200	I want to say one of those times we were on All Games Interactive, like, last year or a couple of years ago.
325200	326700	Like, they had one of these in the house.
326700	328400	Like, they had just acquired one there.
328400	329100	Like, I wonder if...
329100	331000	I think that was the same thing.
331000	332800	So, they know how to make these types of controllers.
332800	337900	Well, apparently, Microsoft is getting in on this now for who knows what type of project.
337900	341800	But it kind of makes sense, you know, with the Wii doing as well as it is.
341800	345500	Microsoft wants a piece of it somehow, so they'll buy somebody else to do it.
345500	347800	Make an agreement to do it.
347800	353100	The press release stated that the first controller that will be coming out will be a big Air wireless controller.
353100	357500	It's a full-size skateboard that will work with skateboarding games.
357500	359000	I mean, this is pretty high-end stuff.
359000	364700	This isn't something that, you know, a gamer that doesn't have a lot of money can pick up.
364700	369200	But still, I mean, if you really want to get immersed in your games, I guess this is the way to do it.
369200	371800	This is what they should be setting up at the Westin.
371800	375700	I mean, this is the kind of thing you don't get to play every day.
375700	376100	There you have it.
376100	376800	What do you think, Loki?
376800	379300	Is this the type of thing you would be interested in at all?
379300	380100	No.
380100	381100	Why not?
381100	381500	I don't know.
381500	387300	It sounds like, as Alton Brown would put it, it's a uni-tasker.
387300	389500	And no one likes a uni-tasker.
389500	390000	Wow.
390000	391100	Nerd.
391100	394800	Only you would quote the Food Network here on our program.
394800	397100	Hey.
397100	401900	So there's a game coming out here pretty soon that I think a lot of people will be interested in.
401900	404900	On a rain-slick precipice of darkness, episode one.
404900	407000	That's right, the Penny Arcade Adventures game.
407000	413500	Episode one has gone gold and is due out on PC later this quarter for $20.
413500	424200	Then I believe later on, also, they will be releasing it to Xbox Live for 1600 Microsoft points, also $20.
424200	430100	It will also make it the most expensive Xbox Live arcade game to date.
430100	433800	Yeah, but if you add up all the parts in Luminous, it's a little more expensive.
433800	439800	That is true, but still though, out of the gate though, this is the most expensive Xbox Live arcade game.
439800	443100	And probably going to set a disturbing trend among games.
443100	445300	Hey, they're going to buy it for 20 bucks.
445300	449700	Let's put out our crappy game for $20.
449700	452700	I don't know, but you kind of sense that Penny Arcade's going to be able to get away with it.
452700	455800	I mean, it's all about if the game is good, but at least the IP is good.
455800	458500	Yeah, I mean, if it's a full game, I mean, that'll be awesome.
458500	462300	But I just have a bad feeling though that other companies are going to look at this and go,
462300	467000	hey, you know what, we can get our game to be $20 too, and they'll sell it and it'll be shit.
467000	470800	Well, if some little internet comic can get $20 for their game,
470800	475000	then we ought to be able to sell our game for $20.
475000	477700	You do that too well, Rob.
477700	480300	I've been snooping in on boardrooms.
480300	481200	So, um...
481200	483500	How about Macintosh?
483500	485100	Who cares? I'm just kidding.
485100	487200	The chat room's asking.
487200	490100	Oh, no love, I guess.
490100	495300	So, do we know anything about the actual game?
495300	497800	There's screenshots and stuff out there. I haven't done a lot of research on the game.
497800	502300	I'm sorry, it is gone gold for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
502300	503500	Well, there you have it.
503500	504500	Awesome.
504500	506800	So you can't say you don't have anything to play on the Mac.
506800	512300	I don't know a lot about this game. Isn't it kind of like an adventure-type game?
512300	514000	It's like an adventure game.
514000	519300	Kind of think of like a cross between one of the LucasArts adventure games and Final Fantasy.
519300	526400	So you've got the turn-based fighting in there as well, and it's all the Penny Arcade humor.
526400	527900	I don't know.
527900	528900	Interesting.
528900	529900	It looks really cool.
529900	533900	Alright. Well, Rockband has made some progress, a lot of progress.
533900	537900	This game, of course, just on about every console out there, except the Wii right now.
537900	541900	It's out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, right?
541900	542900	Don't they have a version of this on PS2?
542900	543900	Yes.
543900	544900	Well, it's out there everywhere.
544900	549900	They've announced that they have sold 3 million copies of the game.
549900	553900	10 million Rockband songs have been downloaded.
553900	557900	4 million of those since March 20th, just about 6 weeks ago.
557900	558900	Damn.
558900	561900	So, yeah, 3 million copies of the game, 10 million.
561900	565900	That means, on the average, people are buying 3 or 4 songs a pop.
565900	567900	And how much do each song cost?
567900	572900	About 2 bucks, depending on what platform and what song.
572900	573900	So, on average, about...
573900	577900	I'm wondering if they're counting those albums as 12 songs sold, though, but I guess they can.
577900	579900	I mean, because they charge more for those, so...
579900	581900	But, and how many people really bought that album?
581900	584900	I'm sure there's plenty. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the artist, but...
584900	585900	I bought a lot of songs on there.
585900	587900	I bought quite a few, too, I gotta admit.
587900	589900	I don't know why I buy them, because I have them in...
589900	593900	I don't either, but it's the ultimate party game, because, like, you're glad to have them when people are over.
593900	597900	You guys are so funny. Like, I don't know why I buy them, but I bought them.
597900	599900	Just, I have those Microsoft points burning a hole in my pocket.
599900	601900	I'm telling you, that's why that stuff is evil.
601900	606900	Because Microsoft, it's so easy to just press that one little button and, doop, spend Microsoft points.
606900	607900	Or add more.
607900	609900	If you need to reload, doop, just add more points.
609900	610900	It's dangerous.
610900	612900	You're not spending money, you're just spending points.
612900	615900	Exactly. I don't notice it until I look at my bank statement and I go,
615900	619900	Son of a bitch, I just bought, like, 40 bucks worth of Microsoft points this month.
619900	621900	What do I have to speak for it?
621900	623900	I bought JIRUS.
623900	625900	That's pretty smart, though, that they...
625900	626900	It is.
626900	627900	Scary.
627900	628900	Oh.
628900	629900	What?
629900	632900	We're going on the tangent train, unfortunately.
632900	633900	Oh, dear God. Alright, what's up?
633900	637900	I'm sorry, you know, because you know me, I'm looking up last minute stories and stuff.
637900	638900	Sure, sure.
638900	644900	And I had to mention this because it just, poof, they had a big little thing in the corner of the screen here.
644900	661900	Apparently, at Maker Faire 2008 today, MacGyver creator and Lee David Zlotov announced that he is making a big budget MacGyver movie.
661900	662900	Fuck yeah.
662900	665900	Yeah, but they're bastardizing everything we left in the 80s.
665900	666900	Yeah, whatever, who cares.
666900	668900	18 movie coming out, too. I mean...
668900	673900	Why didn't they make these movies when they were popular? I don't understand. When MacGyver was still on the air.
673900	679900	It's the whole retro thing. It's just like a few years ago, 70s retro. Like, they remade Charlie's Angels, they remade the Brady Bunch, right?
679900	684900	Now the 80s are coming. Dude, it's just a matter of time before we get the Facts of Life movie.
684900	686900	Who would they cast as Natalie in Tootie?
686900	687900	I don't know.
687900	688900	In Tootie.
688900	690900	I don't know, I just kind of think it's a no.
690900	693900	Rumor is the movie will be made out of a shoelace.
693900	694900	Shut up.
694900	698900	Limbs and a jar of peanut butter.
698900	700900	Can you take us back to video games, please?
700900	712900	Sorry. Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting news coming out with, what is it, Guitar Hero.
712900	718900	Apparently Aerosmith, of course, you know, there's the Aerosmith Guitar Hero game coming out soon.
718900	729900	They are locked into an exclusive contract with Guitar Hero and unfortunately no download content will be coming out for Rock Band featuring Aerosmith.
729900	736900	Now I'm not sure if this is going to be forever. I'm assuming it's just for a matter, you know, a length of time, but I mean, God, who cares?
736900	742900	It meaning there's an escape clause in it should Guitar Hero tank in the near future so Aerosmith can get in on the other game.
742900	743900	Yeah.
743900	744900	It's got to be that.
744900	756900	It says apparently excluding, I guess, Rock Band's train kept on rolling, Aerosmith's entire catalog of Rock and Roll hits will be exclusive to Guitar Hero.
756900	766900	And it says Newsweek got confirmation that the Aerosmith publicist and Activision PR that the band's songs would be locked down for an unspecified period of time.
766900	769900	So that is for a limited amount of time.
769900	771900	Meaning there's an escape clause, just in case.
771900	778900	Yeah. And you know what? I mean, it really would be for their best interest to get their song out there as many places as possible.
778900	789900	But, you know, hey, if they're going to throw a lot of money at you for, you know, a certain amount of time of, you know, exclusivity, I guess, more power to them, I guess.
789900	800900	Alright. Well, you know, I don't know. I have a real problem with this kind of stuff because I see this as the beginning, it's the little pebble that starts the snowball that starts the avalanche.
800900	809900	Because we all know, you know, we heard last week Guitar Hero 4 is supposedly following in Rock Band's footsteps where they're going to be adding voice, they're going to be adding drums, possibly.
809900	814900	I mean, a lot of it's speculation. You know, we know there's one. But the thing is, will both play nice?
814900	819900	Or am I going to have to have two of everything, like Noah's frickin' Ark in my gaming closet?
819900	825900	If it's up to Activision, if it's up to Activision, then no they won't. But, if it's up to Microsoft, then yes they will.
825900	832900	And remember, Microsoft, they have strict regulations about their accessories and peripherals that they all have to play nice with each other.
832900	838900	Well, you know what? That shit pisses me off if they don't play nice. And when I get pissed off, we do the FUs of the week.
838900	856900	LOKI, why don't you start us off tonight, since Dark Sakura is not here?
856900	864900	FUs to Gravity for pulling the mustard out of my sandwich and staining my shirt and my shorts with delicious mustard.
864900	870900	Rice Princess, since you're filling in tonight, would you care to give an FU for anything?
870900	875900	FU to Hollywood After Dark for showing Rue McClanahan stripping.
875900	879900	Do we need to describe Bad Movie Night really quick?
879900	880900	Yeah, do it, do it.
880900	882900	Give him a rundown of Bad Movie Night. You haven't talked at all tonight.
882900	883900	No, Matt should do it.
883900	884900	Alright, man.
884900	888900	Okay, Bad Movie Night is where we pick bad movies, bad but entertaining movies to watch.
888900	895900	Sadly, none of my movies got picked. I brought Follow That Bird, the Sesame Street adaptation from 1980s, but my choice was not screened last night.
895900	901900	It wasn't bad enough, I guess. It wasn't that bad of a movie. It was just a classic.
901900	904900	We're all pushing 30. It's pretty bad in retrospect.
904900	913900	No, no, no. Okay, we watched Sleepaway Camp, which I've seen numerous times, but there were a few people that hadn't seen it yet, so that's funny.
913900	917900	I swear to God, I'll ban you from chat if you ruin the twist ending to Sleepaway Camp.
917900	918900	Yeah, do not do it.
918900	921900	Best twist ending ever in a movie, Sleepaway Camp.
921900	923900	And if you haven't seen it, watch it immediately.
923900	928900	You need to watch it, and I swear to God, strap yourself through the chair and force yourself to watch it. The twist ending is worth it.
928900	931900	Yeah, just get through it.
931900	935900	And you gotta love the line where the guy goes, I gotta take a wicked dump.
935900	936900	That's awesome.
936900	939900	I love Sleepaway Camp. That's the ultimate bad movie.
939900	944900	Then we watched this other movie, which, what was it? It was like something ninjas?
944900	947900	We watched it fast-forward, Karate Kidz.
947900	952900	Karate Kidz USA, I think is what it was called. Oh my God, it was horrible.
952900	964900	We fast-forwarded through most of that, but there was a part where the kid called this black biker a souffle, which I don't know how that's an insult, but whatever, and he's all, no one calls me a souffle, I'll see you later.
964900	970900	Like, what? And they basically have the battle, like, hillbillies in the forest or something.
970900	972900	Alright, so tell us about the Rue McClanahan movie.
972900	975900	So the Rue McClanahan movie, that was Hollywood After Dark.
975900	978900	By the way, she was Blanche on the Golden Girls, just in case you didn't know.
978900	986900	It was Hollywood After Dark. It's actually, the film was a part of this, what do they call it, the film crew.
986900	995900	It's the guys that did Mystery Science the year 3000, but now it's essentially the same damn thing, which is without the robots, and now they can swear and stuff during that.
995900	1004900	It was pretty funny, but she was playing the stripper, and they made her strip, and it was, some of the comments they made there were really funny.
1004900	1010900	And then there was these weird chicks that they had stripping. There was no nudity in this movie whatsoever.
1010900	1011900	It was made in the 60s, so it was still taboo.
1011900	1013900	They had pasties with sparset.
1013900	1018900	But they had some really ugly people just stripping, I guess.
1018900	1021900	And the stripping just went on and on.
1021900	1026900	I know, that's what was making me bored. I'm like, oh my god, there's only so many funny things you can say about a woman stripping, but it keeps...
1026900	1029900	Like, doesn't Mystery Science Theater usually cut down the movies a little bit?
1029900	1030900	No.
1030900	1033900	Really? I thought they always cut it down for broadcast. Oh well.
1033900	1039900	Anyhow, funny stuff. I was thinking, we should do a Justin.TV thing where we make fun of movies.
1039900	1041900	That'd be great.
1041900	1043900	Jamie would love that too, she loves bad movies.
1043900	1050900	You can go to the film crew's website, and they have podcasts that are meant for different movies, and you can play them at the same time as you're watching them.
1050900	1051900	Like newer movies?
1051900	1052900	Newer movies, yeah.
1052900	1053900	Nice.
1053900	1060900	And so, I mean, I highly, after watching this, because this seriously was, it's the same Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality.
1060900	1062900	I mean, absolutely, without a doubt.
1062900	1065900	I mean, just nothing cut down whatsoever, no water down.
1065900	1071900	In fact, it was a little bit better, I think, because they were able to say stuff like, you know, make famous jokes and stuff like that.
1071900	1075900	But absolutely awesome. Check out the website.
1075900	1077900	Alright, we got on a tangent.
1077900	1080900	The F.U. of the week goes to the fact that, well, this is actually a good thing.
1080900	1085900	It's been one month since I've been out of the hospital as of today for, you know, when I was in there for pancreatitis.
1085900	1088900	But the F.U. goes to the fact that I'm not sure it's completely gone.
1088900	1090900	Like, I still get chest pains once in a while, and that's kind of irritating.
1090900	1092900	But I found that on Friday.
1092900	1093900	We'll see.
1093900	1094900	F.U. to blood tests.
1094900	1102900	Especially when the nurse doesn't take, or the nurse gives you this really horrible tape that, I swear to God, I've tried to wash this off like five times this week, and the residue from the tape is still not coming off.
1102900	1103900	Wow, that's gross.
1103900	1104900	I know, it just won't come off.
1104900	1105900	Try alcohol.
1105900	1106900	That's what I'm gonna have to do.
1106900	1107900	Horrible.
1107900	1108900	Not the drinkable alcohol.
1108900	1109900	I know that.
1109900	1112900	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
1112900	1114900	Talk about Fatal Inertia.
1114900	1117900	Fatal Inertia, this is the interesting thing about it.
1117900	1121900	It was going to be coming out as a PlayStation 3 launch title.
1121900	1125900	Then, apparently, it was gonna be on the Xbox 360.
1125900	1128900	Now it's back on the PlayStation Network.
1128900	1130900	It came out for the 360.
1130900	1131900	Did it?
1131900	1133900	Yeah, it did, like, last September, I think.
1133900	1134900	As an arcade title?
1134900	1136900	No, as a full-blown title.
1136900	1138900	Oh, I thought this was an arcade title.
1138900	1142900	This game, I had high hopes on it, because originally when they were first showing up,
1142900	1149900	like, pre-PS3 launch, this game looked like it was gonna be just like F-Zero or something
1149900	1153900	like that, a combat racing game, but I played the demo of it, and the demo kinda sucked,
1153900	1157900	but I hear that the demo wasn't a really good representation of the game, but now they're
1157900	1159900	supposed to be making it better.
1159900	1160900	Interesting.
1160900	1164900	The EX, Facial Inertia EX is coming out to the PlayStation Network.
1164900	1168900	See, that's what confuses me, because it was coming on PSN, whereas the other one was on
1168900	1170900	360, so I thought it was an arcade title.
1170900	1171900	Alright, I get it now.
1171900	1175900	Well, I guess not a lot of people got it on the 360, because I didn't even know about
1175900	1176900	it, but here's the thing.
1176900	1180900	They're gonna be adding to it a brand new training mode, more tracks in the game, and
1180900	1181900	apparently the game is not as difficult.
1181900	1183900	They've actually lowered the difficulty a little bit.
1183900	1187900	Well, the track, the thing I didn't like about the game was the track design was really
1187900	1188900	confusing.
1188900	1192900	It was hard to tell where you're supposed to go, and you get lost pretty easy.
1192900	1195900	$29.99 late May is when this game is coming out.
1195900	1197900	Yeah, that's about the price I think the other one was, too.
1197900	1200900	I think it was $39.99 when it came out.
1200900	1202900	So, awesome.
1202900	1207900	So, Mega Man has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records Gamer's Edition.
1207900	1211900	I actually had a chance to check this out at a bookstore the other day.
1211900	1216900	I thought it was pretty well put together, but I still laugh at the fact that there's
1216900	1220900	gaming world records in there, and they're kind of retarded, but whatever.
1220900	1227900	But apparently there are 46 Mega Man games in existence, making it the largest, I guess,
1227900	1230900	franchise out there.
1230900	1235900	There are 17 games in the classic series, 11 Mega Man X games, 4 Mega Man Zero games,
1235900	1241900	2 Mega Man ZX games, 3 Mega Man Legend games, 6 Mega Man Battle Network games, and 3 Mega
1241900	1243900	Man Star Force games.
1243900	1251900	And I know there's a lot more coming out as well.
1251900	1252900	Lots of Mega Man.
1252900	1253900	You know, I was tempted, though.
1253900	1257900	The other day I saw the Mega Man Collection, which was a game I think I rented once.
1257900	1261900	It's great, because the old school Mega Man games are awesome, and they have the new one
1261900	1264900	that came out, well, it's not that new now, but it came out on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.
1264900	1268900	Well, you can play old GameCube games on your Wii, and that blockbuster we went to to get
1268900	1272900	Sleepaway Camp the other day had the Mega Man Collection for sale for GameCube, but
1272900	1273900	previously played copy.
1273900	1274900	15 bucks.
1274900	1275900	Nice.
1275900	1276900	I almost bought it.
1276900	1277900	Well, so here's the thing.
1277900	1280900	So I'm thinking, like, why not buy that, and then, you know, because it's going to come
1280900	1281900	out on Virtual Console eventually.
1281900	1283900	I thought it was 1999 when it first came out, so.
1283900	1284900	Yeah, but still.
1284900	1285900	A few years ago.
1285900	1287900	15 is not bad.
1287900	1288900	It's cheap.
1288900	1290900	It's like six, seven Mega Man games.
1290900	1291900	Eight, maybe.
1291900	1292900	I don't remember how many were in there, but a lot.
1292900	1294900	Well, only three of them are really even worth playing anyway.
1294900	1295900	That's true.
1295900	1297900	And that was the first three that were ever created, so.
1297900	1298900	All the rest of them.
1298900	1300900	Hitstun says, don't get the GameCube one.
1300900	1301900	Why not?
1301900	1304900	I thought the GameCube one had the remixed music, which was cool.
1304900	1308900	There, I want to say that each version had, like, there was a PlayStation 2 and then there
1308900	1312900	was a GameCube one, and I think each one had, like, a different unlockable game in
1312900	1313900	there or something.
1313900	1314900	Hmm.
1314900	1315900	All right, well, whatever.
1315900	1319180	I'm probably not actually going to get the game anyway, because, you know, Irene's going
1319180	1320180	to call me this week.
1320180	1321180	She's going to be like, dude, Rob, Karazhan.
1321180	1322180	Rob, Karazhan.
1322180	1324900	I know, and I'm going to be like, oh, fuck Mega Man.
1324900	1326020	All right.
1326020	1327900	Let's read some mail.
1327900	1337900	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, if you'd like to send us some emails, we will read
1337900	1338900	them on air.
1338900	1342460	Dark Soccer's not here tonight, so I'm filling in, reading some email from our listeners,
1342460	1346740	and I got to say this, kids, you guys wrote a lot of emails this week, and so we can only
1346740	1348140	really read so many.
1348140	1350100	Dark Soccer's usually very nice, and she'll try to read them all.
1350100	1351100	I am not as nice.
1351100	1352100	I apologize.
1352100	1353100	No, actually, I don't.
1353100	1355740	We've got a show to do here, and we want to get out of here at 4, you know, 11 o'clock,
1355740	1357860	so I'm going to pick some tonight.
1357860	1361300	Really quickly, ShadowCharlie sent us an email about this whole article.
1361300	1365220	He basically copy-pasted an article about the Mothers Against Drunk Driving Attacking
1365220	1366700	Grand Theft Auto 4.
1366700	1367700	Retarded.
1367700	1368700	And why is that?
1368700	1370100	Well, let me give you the gist of what happened.
1370100	1374540	Basically, they're pissed because you can actually drive drunk in the game, and I believe
1374540	1376820	it's the objective of one of the missions in the game.
1376820	1380140	They're claiming Grand Theft Auto should be re-rated as adults only.
1380140	1382700	It's not, that's the spin that they were putting on it.
1382700	1387420	There is no, I mean, you can drive drunk in the game, but they tell you that, you know,
1387420	1391980	even when you, it's one of the dates, whatever, you go in there and you can drink and stuff,
1391980	1396580	and you can either try to drive home, which is pretty difficult, and the police will catch
1396580	1397580	you.
1397580	1402980	I mean, they'll see, notice that you're driving drunk if you do try, and it also suggests
1402980	1407460	right as you're coming out of the bar, it says, well, maybe you should take a cab, and
1407460	1411340	you can hail a cab, you know, to take you back home, but, you know.
1411340	1413260	Sensationalism around Grand Theft Auto 4?
1413260	1414260	I know, it's crazy.
1414260	1415260	Oh, surely you jest.
1415260	1419820	Yeah, I know, and people like, you know, claiming things that aren't actually in the game, yeah,
1419820	1420820	that's surprising.
1420820	1424820	See, that's so stupid, because you can do other shit in the games.
1424820	1430220	Yeah, murder okay, truck driving, whoa, that's taking it too far.
1430220	1431860	Excuse me, sir, you gotta change your rating.
1431860	1436180	Frisbee in chat is screaming, it's not real driving, it's not real drunk.
1436180	1437380	Yeah, it's all.
1437380	1441460	It is pretty cool the way it's done, though, like the whole camera shakes around and stuff,
1441460	1445220	and randomly your car will swerve in different directions, and you have to kind of, you know,
1445220	1449500	counter-steer for that, but I like it, I think it's pretty cool.
1449500	1453220	You know, you can ride animals while drunk in World of Warcraft, and no one says anything
1453220	1454220	about that.
1454220	1455220	That's true.
1455220	1459180	No one said anything about, was it Saints Row, you could get high and stoned and stuff
1459180	1465220	in that game, you can also get drunk and drive around and kill people, in fact, they kind
1465220	1468820	of insist that when you are drunk, you have superpowers and you can punch people really
1468820	1472660	far away, so I don't know, I don't know.
1472660	1473660	Interesting.
1473660	1480060	Alright, moving on to the next email from GS68, hey OLR crew, specifically Loki and
1480060	1484060	Rob Rob Rob, I have a bad feeling about your appearance at Fonami, you're not listed under
1484060	1489060	the panel section of the Fonami2008 site at fonami.com, are you gonna try and make a last
1489060	1492060	minute arrangement or something, if there's no OLR panel this year, then I suppose us
1492060	1496220	Bay Area OLR fans will just have to find some other way to meet up at Fonami, less than
1496220	1500900	slash three GS68, this email brought to you by Hooters, home of the never-ending girl's
1500900	1504700	thoughts, god that Olive Garden thing has caught on, everybody's signing their emails
1504700	1508300	of strange things now, uh yeah, we're gonna have to break the news to you, we are not
1508300	1511460	attending Fonami this year, we do not plan on doing a live panel this year, it is nothing
1511460	1515820	against Fonami, we still love the staff and everything, the thing is that, you know, Jamie
1515820	1519500	has other plans this year, and quite frankly, we just kind of, you know, it's a three day
1519500	1523660	weekend, it's one of the few that us working kids have during the year, and so we just
1523660	1528040	want to take the weekend to kind of do other things, and also since we're gonna be hopefully
1528040	1532180	doing packs and some other shows later in the year, we've just decided to sit this one
1532180	1539020	out, sorry, is anybody going to Fonami just for fun, in curiosity, no, no, not that, you
1539020	1543060	always go, this is the first year you haven't been to Fonami in a long time, isn't it, no
1543060	1547900	it hasn't, I thought you went like every year, I used to like when I was in the anime, what
1547900	1554020	like five years ago, but you know, and even then, it was only really like three years
1554020	1559420	in a row. Well still, those of you guys that are going to Fonami, we hope you have a lot,
1559420	1565460	a lot of fun, and good luck. ASEN is being yelled in chat, and ASEN is too soon, ASEN
1565460	1571380	is very soon, the problem is, I was originally wanting to go to ASEN, but my medical things
1571380	1575460	came up and I had to put it aside, because you know, that kind of stuff is more important
1575460	1580660	for me right now, maybe next year, I'm really hoping. Packs is the most definite right now,
1580660	1585900	and you never know what else might happen in the future, if you have a con that's drivable,
1585900	1591780	or let's say in California, or like Reno, or even Oregon, hell, let us know, we'll try
1591780	1595980	to come if you'd like to have us there, otherwise if it's something we've got to fly to, it
1595980	1599500	just depends on the budget, and by budget, I mean how much money we have in our pockets,
1599500	1604980	because we don't, you notice we don't run ads on this show, meaning we have no money.
1604980	1609220	Mark from Plymouth, England sends us the next email, it's a bit long, so I'm just going
1609220	1614180	to read some of this here, he says, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, although the track of this
1614180	1618140	message may lead you to at first think that I might be. I want to start by saying that
1618140	1622420	here in the UK there's no real Nintendo history, as back as in the 80s, Commodore 64 and ZX
1622420	1626100	Spectrum ruled the gaming of everyone, and Nintendo was almost unknown to me and my friends
1626100	1630600	until I was too old and busy with serious things, busy with serious dating to get back
1630600	1635540	into it, here the NES and SNES were pretty much unknown things. Now my main point, Wii
1635540	1639660	isn't increasing the gamer base, as mentioned by you on episode 277, and often it's a war
1639660	1643740	cry by many of the too many podcasts I listen to. I know you don't hate the Wii and are
1643740	1648620	open about its strengths and weaknesses, however I believe not as my personal experience as
1648620	1652660	I am a gamer, definitely not hardcore, although I'm very much into all the latest news, I'm
1652660	1657100	presently most all about handhelds due to access issues to the big ass TV. My Wii is
1657100	1661420	also freely played by my wife, who would categorize herself as a non-gamer and her family, in
1661420	1665340	fact my next night shift has been scheduled for a Wii Fit night, in which my wife invited
1665340	1669680	her friends and sisters for drinks and laughs on the board. This type of sociability has
1669680	1673580	led all in the family to believe, all the family to buying Wii's, and they are now the
1673580	1678060	prime console, the collateral fallout is that many others in the household now play, whereas
1678060	1682500	before one person, maybe two, per household played the kids and parents are buying games
1682500	1688360	for the Wii. Is there any figures on players per console for old and present gen? I'd like
1688360	1695060	to bet the figure has risen. Is there anything like that? I doubt it. I don't know. I'm gonna
1695060	1697820	kind of cut some of this email out that he was just sort of making the point that, you
1697820	1702220	know, the Wii is definitely kind of caught on in that way, but what about, you know,
1702220	1706180	the software? He talks about why do some shovelware games sell well? Is that the taste of light
1706180	1710180	gamers are different and a lot of early games to the Wii are games ported over from PS2
1710180	1714500	games? It's because people don't know any better, the moms and pops that are going to
1714500	1719020	like stores that are buying their kids games, they look at it, they're like, okay well they
1719020	1722660	can get Mario Kart and they can get this other game that looks very similar, and all they
1722660	1725860	have to go by is the pictures on the back and stuff and the price point and they're
1725860	1731300	like, well it's, you know, it's $20 cheaper or $30 cheaper, so hey let's go ahead and
1731300	1735500	give it a shot. And unfortunately it's just like movies, you know, you may like go to
1735500	1739060	your, you know, Reynolds store or whatever and you're looking at the back of the movie
1739060	1742660	and all you have to go by is the cover and, you know, what it says on the back and you
1742660	1747700	can bring it home and it's complete shit, so. Alright, let's get to Mark's second half
1747700	1751700	here where he has a question. I still haven't dipped my toes into the HD gaming experience.
1751700	1756300	I like the PS3 but I'm not sure due to price and limited titles, although a good six would
1756300	1759660	do me for now. I hate Metal Gear Solid as it just doesn't float my boat personally.
1759660	1763780	I hate cut scenes. The Xbox 360 has a catalog but I get burned on the original Xbox when
1763780	1767980	shortly after buying one they went and retired it for the 360. Also my brother has gone through
1767980	1772700	four 360s. So is now a good time to buy a 360? Have the issues of Red Ring of Death
1772700	1776420	been cured or should I wait a little longer as the trading games pile is getting bigger
1776420	1780780	every day? Is the smaller, cooler 360 on the horizon? I know it's an old question from
1780780	1786100	last year and before but now the 360 is maturing or has it lost its legs and arthritis is setting
1786100	1790540	in or is now the time to jump in? And the arcade is cheaper than the Wii right now.
1790540	1795100	I have no intention of going online. Is a hard drive necessary for the download content
1795100	1800100	or do I have to accept the patches or the wave of the future? I would say that it's
1800100	1807180	probably fine to buy it now. I think 360 is probably going to be at its peak for the next
1807180	1811220	couple of years. You're right, the system has matured but that's when all the really
1811220	1813860	good games start coming out over the next couple of years and then we'll start getting
1813860	1818940	into a new cycle of systems. As far as hardware problems go, the new 360s that they have out
1818940	1823860	now aren't really as prone to the hardware problems. The main one that people are worried
1823860	1828280	about is the 3 Ring thing and they've still got the extended warranty on it. So I would
1828280	1832580	say you're probably better off now buying a newer console but just make sure you're
1832580	1837900	buying a newer console and not a refurbished older one. That's pretty much it. Here's what
1837900	1843620	you've got to watch out for is that maybe a new 360 is going to come out. This is really
1843620	1846780	inevitable with every console but there were some strong rumors this week. I don't think
1846780	1849820	I'm spoiling anything on show. There were some very strong rumors this week about the
1849820	1855260	Blu-ray and I guess actually a press release was put out so it might be more than rumor.
1855260	1861060	Blu-ray or the Xbox 360 is actually going to be getting a Blu-ray in it. Somebody's
1861060	1866220	been contracted to actually put that technology together where the Blu-ray, Xbox 360 is going
1866220	1870940	to be coming out because HD DVD is officially dead. Microsoft is left with no choice but
1870940	1873940	to get on the Blu-ray board if they want their system to play movies as well. They're not
1873940	1878380	DVD, HD movies. So you've got to be careful because you never know what's going to happen.
1878380	1883860	The day after you buy your system, this might come out but that's just a chance you take.
1883860	1889300	It happens with anything. Ask anyone who owns an Apple product. You buy an iPhone and then
1889300	1895060	a few months later, super iPhone! Watch, there will be a super iPhone this year just so you
1895060	1902300	know. RossdielUT wrote us and wanted to get in a few words about this. I want to get in
1902300	1906420	a few words on the idea of gays in gaming. Sexuality isn't anywhere near as taboo as
1906420	1909620	it was five or so years ago. Now it seems that every other game is so chock full of
1909620	1913780	cock teasing that it borders on the tasteless. Dead or Alive is built entirely upon sexual
1913780	1917140	exploitation and the guy game was only pulled off the shelves because it featured an underage
1917140	1921240	girl going topless. The reason we don't see gay characters in games or even a very deep
1921240	1925540	exploration of sexuality besides making women as slutty as possible has nothing to do with
1925540	1929380	the rating systems out there. Conan, a god of war, had frontal nudity as you know. The
1929380	1933180	problem here is the striking lack of diversity in the gaming industry. While game players
1933180	1937720	come from all faiths, colors, creeds, and orientations, game developers do not. The
1937720	1941020	overwhelming majority of game developers in the West are straight white men who in turn
1941020	1946040	only know how to make games aimed at straight white men. I imagine any meeting of game developers
1946040	1951020	in the West sounding like something straight out of Xbox Live with the types of things
1951020	1956500	you hear there on Xbox Live. What do you think so far? Do you think that might be why you
1956500	1961500	don't see it is because of the people developing it? But I'm always of the mindset that well
1961500	1965580	if you want to get other audiences into gaming maybe you ought to start putting that kind
1965580	1971060	of stuff into games. Well I think that also they also run the problem with like the ESRB.
1971060	1977740	They rate that kind of crap, you know, more offensive than female nudity. Alright well
1977740	1981260	Rastu goes on, of course I can't talk about this without mentioning the audience. Go to
1981260	1985260	any internet gaming forum, for that matter Xbox Live, and you'll find rampant sexism
1985260	1989100	and homophobia. One need only look at what happened to Jade Raymond, leading up to the
1989100	1993260	launch of Assassin's Creed. For months last year, sites like Kotaku and Joystiq were more
1993260	1997080	concerned with making creepy blogs about how nice she looked and smelled than covering
1997080	2002600	the goddamn game. The idiocy climax in a horrific comic depicting Jade, a well-educated, experienced
2002600	2006860	professional game developer, as a brainless bimbo who can't even pronounce creative, trying
2006860	2010980	to get sales for the game by sucking off nerds ending in a bukkake scene. Given the gaming
2010980	2015420	industry's absolute incompetence when it comes to marketing and demographics research, everyone
2015420	2019440	assumes that the sexist and homophobes are the only people interested in games. The lack
2019440	2024180	of game sales on the Wii only helps to further this misconception. Thus we get more objectified
2024180	2028980	women and the role of gay characters is limited to the joke character like Makoto from Enchanted
2028980	2034220	Arms. With time, as gaming businesses learn the importance of demographics and stop belittling
2034220	2038620	people who aren't straight, white men, this will pass, we just need to hang on. Ross Deal
2038620	2044980	UT, this message brought to you by Pizza Hut, makers of the pure grease pizza. So, I don't
2044980	2050760	know. What do you think, Irene? You're a woman, an OMG girl that plays video games. Do you
2050760	2057760	think that games aren't coming out geared more towards women because... See, there's
2058540	2064420	a stereotype that women love playing puzzle games. I don't think it's so much that as
2064420	2069700	it is puzzle games don't have overly sexualized women in the games. As the woman that plays
2069700	2074580	puzzle pirates? No, yeah. I mean, that's part of the reason, because I don't have to think
2074580	2078900	about like, okay, I'm going to see some, you know, slutty things, some woman like, you
2078900	2083940	know, slutified in this game or whatever, but... Although, that sounds like a good idea
2083940	2090940	for a puzzle game. Puzzle Sluts. Yay! OMG, let's put that on the OLR dream game list.
2091140	2096300	What would Puzzle Sluts be? It would just be like an over-sexified version of like,
2096300	2098900	you know, any sort of puzzle game. It's gotta be better than Bubble Bath Babes, though.
2098900	2105140	It's gotta be much better than that. How exactly would Puzzle Sluts work? Well, they have like...
2105140	2109020	But they need to have, okay, there needs to be like a code that you put in, like up, up,
2109020	2112540	down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and you get male Puzzle Sluts. Because
2112540	2118420	we need something for everybody in this game. Okay, I think I can see how this might work.
2118420	2124300	You would have in each, like, so let's say, let's go the route of like, say, Puzzle Fighter,
2124300	2128880	okay? Alright. So, you would have inside each one of the gems, like, a different woman.
2128880	2132940	And when you break the gem, they would fall to the bottom of the screen and, you know,
2132940	2136460	more gems next to each other and they just start kind of going at it in the bottom of
2136460	2144460	the screen until you get this big orgy that pile up in the bottom. I like it. Brilliant.
2144460	2152660	Brilliant. Patent pending. Nobody steal it. I don't know. Okay, like, here's a good example.
2152660	2157660	Heavenly Sword. You know how the main character is like this hot chick that, you know, kicks
2157660	2162740	ass and all that stuff. I was kind of detracted from it because it was just like, come on,
2162740	2168500	you know, that's totally not realistic. Like, if she were just a normal girl, I probably
2168500	2172820	would have been more inclined to play it. Been more focused on actual gameplay than,
2172820	2179260	like, ogling over her or whatever. But I don't know. I think that something like putting,
2179260	2183820	you know, gay characters or sensible women in games is something that's gonna have to
2183820	2188900	be left up to independent, you know, game producers. Well, like, for example, Saints
2188900	2195260	Row 2 that's coming out, you can be a male and or female character or you can be a transsexual
2195260	2200220	in the game and run around and you can totally customize your characters and stuff. But you
2200220	2204320	know people that are gonna be playing Saints Row aren't gonna be playing them, like, seriously.
2204320	2208180	They're gonna be playing them to mock them. I gotta show you this, though. Now, does this
2208180	2212340	pique your interest, Irene? Because this story came up earlier this week and I don't think
2212340	2216740	it's on our show tonight, but Lost Planet Colonies is going to be, I guess they're getting
2216740	2221140	a new version of it coming out. It's some type of expansion. One of the characters in
2221140	2227140	it is the Dead Rising star, you know, Frank West, but he doesn't have clothes on. He's
2227140	2232620	just wearing a skimpy little pair of blue and yellow boxer briefs. That's all he's wearing.
2232620	2237560	Now, is that maybe the contrast to your Heavenly Sword? Would you maybe be interested in checking
2237560	2241240	out Lost Planet Colonies? Because, hello, good looking man running around in his skimpy
2241240	2245780	undies. See, that's debatable. I don't think he looks good. And he's kinda retarded to
2245780	2250460	be running around on this, like, frozen wasteland. Yeah, it's kinda weird. He's like, I'm fine.
2250460	2256100	Well, that won't do at all. Yeah. I guess sex does sell, but do they really need to
2256100	2259940	sexualize people? I mean, there are plenty of good games. Act Deft, by the way, is clearing
2259940	2263100	up. It's like the greatest hits version of the game. Yeah, they added more crap to it.
2263100	2267940	See, I don't follow Lost Planet. Sorry, guys. Remember when games, you didn't even have
2267940	2273860	to care about their sexuality? Mario walking around, like, in overalls and shit, you know,
2273860	2277460	like, well, but as I think stories become more, I mean, let's face it, video games today
2277460	2283340	are practically big-budget movies. Big, big-budget movies. And, you know, we, you know, kinda
2283340	2287180	like to see that sort of representation in movies as well. And it took a while for movies
2287180	2291340	to get there, but it got there. Okay, tell me which Yuna you like better. Do you like
2291340	2297040	Yuna from Final Fantasy X, or do you like her better in X-2? Because, remember, she
2297040	2303220	got all hella slutty in the second one. I, I guess as a character, I just like X's story
2303220	2309300	better. So I liked her better in X, but X-2 is like bubblegum pop fun. X-2 is like, today
2309300	2315100	I'm in the mood to listen to the Spice Girls because I'm just in that mood. Okay. Final
2315100	2319540	Fantasy X is, today I'm listening to Depeche Mode because I'm emo. Okay, yeah, I guess
2319540	2325220	it also depends on what kind of mood you're in. If you just wanna play, like, your motivation
2325220	2330340	behind playing the game, but if it's strictly to, like, get off, it's just silly. It's like,
2330340	2334860	come on. Is that what you're gonna base your game on? Some kind of, like, sexy character
2334860	2339300	or something? You can't do more with what you have. You can't be creative. Alright,
2339300	2342420	well let's, let's do some more emails here, cause I wanna get through the rest of these
2342420	2346380	emails tonight. Ben from Tokyo has emailed us. Wanted to clear some things up. We were
2346380	2350020	talking about Singapore. Speaking of, you know, the gays gaming thing, we talked to
2350020	2353860	last week about how in Singapore, they're adding homosexuality to what is instantly
2353860	2358620	making a game adults only overseas. And that was Mass Effect was impacted by that because
2358620	2363460	it was OMG Lesbians for, like, five seconds in the game. So Ben wrote us, says, love the
2363460	2367020	show, wanna keep it short, I have to rant about some stuff. Singapore. In Singapore
2367020	2372180	it is basically illegal to be gay. Illegal as in, you go to jail. More precise would
2372180	2376700	be to say that anything openly gay is banned. Gays are not employed by public offices, not
2376700	2381020	allowed to live in certain areas. That part also holds for certain foreigners and homosexual
2381020	2384680	acts are illegal. So complaining about the rating system is like accusing a serial killer
2384680	2388780	of fashion crimes. By the way, it is only the American rating system that is crazy about
2388780	2393600	sexual topics. That's just, it's so disheartening to read. I mean, you do have to remember that,
2393600	2398760	you know, we are kind of lucky sometimes to live in a nation that, at least we don't get
2398760	2402380	arrested for it, even though there's still a lot of progress to make. You know, you look
2402380	2408880	at countries like Canada and Spain and wherever where gays can get married and it's just whatever.
2408880	2413500	No one cares because it's not like OMG they're gonna come into my house and redecorate things.
2413500	2420100	Watch out. It's, you know, it's just whatever, you know. People are so much more laid back
2420100	2424060	and then sometimes you have to come to that harsh reality where like, wow, you know, America
2424060	2430740	is way ahead of some other people. Kind of just sad. Just sad. Yeah, but even California
2430740	2436900	is kind of more the exception anyway. I mean, if you go to any other place in the US, you
2436900	2442460	probably, they probably won't be as accepting. Yeah, it depends. It just depends. Like I
2442460	2445460	was saying last week, I think we're getting to a point, I think we're very lucky, where
2445460	2452340	most 20-somethings and most younger 30-somethings and most teenagers even. I think teenagers
2452340	2456820	even more so. Everybody knows someone who's gay and more and more people just have the
2456820	2462540	attitude of whatever. It's no big deal. It's just whatever. They realize it doesn't mean
2462540	2468460	they're suddenly gonna fuck me in the ass when I'm not looking. I think people are over
2468460	2472780	that real kind of childish mentality about it, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like,
2472780	2476380	is that what they're really afraid of? Like, oh my god, he's gonna come fuck me in the
2476380	2482900	ass. I don't know. I have no idea. It's just comical to me. I'm left to assume. It's funny.
2482900	2488060	I don't know. It is stupid. Alright. Copyright. Ben wanted to say something about copyright
2488060	2491300	too. While you just mentioned it briefly, I have to say that downloading fan subs and
2491300	2495140	any other copyrighted material is of course illegal, even if there is no licensing in
2495140	2498720	your country. Without licensing, there is just nobody to complain about it. That doesn't
2498720	2503580	make it legal. Thus, fan subs are in a somewhat gray area. Note that this only holds if your
2503580	2508980	country has a copyright law, which, for example, Thailand at least didn't have for a long time.
2508980	2512460	So that kind of came up on last week's show about the whole copyright thing went back
2512460	2518460	and forth. So there you have it. More emails. I know there's a lot tonight, but actually
2518460	2523600	these are pretty good. Rama emailed us very happy. There was a mention of video power
2523600	2528180	on last week's show and was kind of running down video power a little bit. The first season
2528180	2532180	at Johnny Arcade, he would come into the room, talk about games for five minutes that he's
2532180	2536140	going to review, and then there was a 20-minute cartoon. But the second season was a game
2536140	2540140	show. Four people would get a chance to ask Johnny a question to compete on the show.
2540140	2543420	First round was getting the highest score in a game. Second round was trivia questions.
2543420	2547300	After that was the round where you ran through the game area and you could get, you know,
2547300	2552360	Jansport bags, Genesis, and Neo Geo console. I pretty much think that Acclaim did a majority
2552360	2556180	of the sponsorship of the show, but I could be wrong. Well, that's it for now. Keep up
2556180	2561500	the good work, and y'all in two months for OLRCon 2008. There's an OLRCon 2008?
2561500	2562500	Yeah. Wow.
2562500	2565060	Where the hell have I been?
2565060	2567260	I don't know. Where have you been?
2567260	2570940	I heard something was going down over 4th of July, but I didn't know we were like actually
2570940	2574820	having a little convention. What the crap? Am I always the last one to hear about this?
2574820	2575820	Hear about what?
2575820	2576820	OLRCon.
2576820	2582220	I guess there's an OLRCon happening. Like, I think it's 4th of July. I know. Rama, you
2582220	2584820	need to email me and tell me. I've not been told about this.
2584820	2586540	Nor have I.
2586540	2591740	Or I forgot. You know what? I'm human. I might have forgot. I'll go. I mean, obviously, if
2591740	2597100	it's OLRCon, I guess I'll go, but I'm just kind of curious what's going on. Well, let's
2597100	2601620	advertise it on the show if something's going on.
2601620	2605340	And lastly, Rama closes with, this email was brought to you by Joey Paisanos of Mulberry
2605340	2611880	Street in the heart of Little Italy. You'll love Paisanos. Suddenly, everybody's attaching
2611880	2620060	a commercial to their ads. Let's see. One more email for you guys. Again, I can't get
2620060	2621060	to them all tonight.
2621060	2625900	ShadowNextGen emails us, after you bashed IGN last week for giving Grand Theft Auto
2625900	2629100	4 a 10 out of 10 and suggesting that something shady might be going on due to them having
2629100	2633000	the exclusive, what is your opinion now that the majority of other sites have also given
2633000	2637180	this game 10 out of 10 scores? I think RossdielUT was completely off the mark last week with
2637180	2640740	his rants over reviews, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts. If a game is bad such
2640740	2644380	as Laird, then the review scores will reflect it. If the game is good such as Grand Theft
2644380	2649500	Auto 4, then the review scores will reflect that as well. Thoughts keep up the good work.
2649500	2653820	Here it is. I never said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was probably not going to get 10s out
2653820	2657580	of 10s from everywhere, and it's probably pretty deserving of those 10s out of 10s.
2657580	2662180	I'm just saying that kind of policy about, you know, sure we'll accept the exclusive.
2662180	2666260	What was it? I think they came out and admitted that they had traded for advertising on the
2666260	2670820	site to get the exclusive review. I mean, that kind of sets a bad precedent because
2670820	2674580	yes, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a good, good game, I don't know. What about games in the
2674580	2680740	future? Yeah, because they said, oh yeah, this didn't affect our review score. Let's
2680740	2685900	not forget about what went down at GameSpot and Kane and Lynch. Hello. Well, let's not
2685900	2690920	forget what happened at GameSpot and Grand Theft Auto 4 where there was a review that
2690920	2696100	leaked out that gave it a 9.5 and then that was retracted and there was a 10.0 review
2696100	2699740	put out. You know, who's to say that they weren't going to do that? And apparently there
2699740	2705540	is a process where they rate it and then they do a peer review process and then they re-rate
2705540	2710980	it or some shit like that. I don't know, it's just, it's fishy and not to say that this
2710980	2715540	game wouldn't have gotten, you know, high marks anyways, but it's still fishy and it's
2715540	2720780	not a really good situation to be in, especially after the whole, you know, Kane and Lynch
2720780	2726420	thing. Okay, and honestly, do people really give a shit? Oh, we rated it 9.5, but really
2726420	2732080	it's a 10. We were off by 0.5. It's like, okay, it's a good game. We get what you're
2732080	2735660	conveying with your ranking. It's just more crap that they can throw up in their advertising
2735660	2741700	campaigns for it. It's been rated a 10 by IGN, you know, 10 out of 10 and they can throw
2741700	2746940	that in their commercials and advertise that shit and it's just more like, you know, points
2746940	2754380	for them, I guess. Okay. Alright, well, there's our thoughts on that and that's going to do
2754380	2758140	it for the mailbag. If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. I'm going
2758140	2762140	to tell you guys for future weeks, honestly, the more condensed you can make your emails,
2762140	2766020	the better because, you know, our mailbag statement has been going kind of long lately,
2766020	2770960	so we're going to have to start getting choosier. So, we do try to condense down big emails,
2770960	2776220	but if you can do that, it makes it all the better. So, just so you know. If you want
2776220	2779860	to go off for a longer period of time, there is always a Skype line. If you listen to us
2779860	2787780	live Sunday nights on allgames.com. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki. Okay,
2787780	2794180	well, there's a new card game coming out, not Eye of Judgment, but it's being released
2794180	2800620	by EA. It's called Battle Forge, the collectible trading card game. It's coming out this fall
2800620	2805660	and doesn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but they're comparing it to, of course,
2805660	2813140	Magic the Gathering. It's a fantasy online real-time strategy game with collectible trading
2813140	2818340	cards and says the game will release this fall, allow players to win, trade, and buy
2818340	2824340	virtual cards to create the ultimate deck. So, it's like, I guess, Magic the Gathering
2824340	2830460	online, but the way I see it, it's another way for EA to sell a lot of download content.
2830460	2836060	That's really all it is. It's a download content whoring machine.
2836060	2841820	Huh. Because you know developers these days love these things where they can just charge
2841820	2844460	extra money for the expansions and all that stuff, huh?
2844460	2847200	Exactly. You know, it's a collectible card game. What they're trying to do is they're
2847200	2853820	trying to make a game that captures the fans of Magic the Gathering. It's going to be at
2853820	2858980	the same level as Magic the Gathering and get people buying these card decks and stuff
2858980	2868060	like that as much as possible. So, I don't know. I guess it's a good idea strategy-wise,
2868060	2870780	but will people fall for it? I don't know.
2870780	2874780	All right. Well, R-Type Command is coming out on May 6th. That's coming out on the PSP.
2874780	2879060	It's R-Type the strategy game, which ought to be interesting. But what's kind of cool
2879060	2883260	about this is that Atlus has actually announced that they are going to be putting out just
2883260	2887260	for a limited time and just for those that buy the game from either GameStop, Amazon,
2887260	2891900	GameCrazy, EB Games Canada, and some other specific retailers, they get to get a little
2891900	2896980	free plastic miniature replica of the R9 spacecraft, which actually has that little pod thing in
2896980	2902860	front and everything. So, if you're a game collector, specifically one that likes shmups,
2902860	2906540	as they're called, then maybe you ought to think about getting this. Probably pre-orders
2906540	2909500	only through some of these chains. So, take a look.
2909500	2916420	Yeah. Another game coming out this fall as well on the DS, and probably a fan of Rob's
2916420	2923940	here, Tech Mobile Kickoff will be landing on the DS. They haven't really said too many
2923940	2927420	details on it yet, but here's what we do know. There's going to be a variety of teams with
2927420	2933820	32 to choose from. There will be all new cut scenes showing off dramatic presentations
2933820	2939320	of various plays, a customizable playbook, stylus control. Of course, it's going to have
2939320	2947580	Wi-Fi and wireless multiplayer, customizable teams, and it's based on, of course, Tecmo,
2947580	2952300	Super Bowl.
2952300	2957640	Very nice. By the way, tonight we were going to be doing the match game, but unfortunately
2957640	2961860	we didn't get around to it. Our resources were a little limited this week, so just a
2961860	2964840	reminder, because this is the point where we were supposed to do match game, but we're
2964840	2968780	tabling it to next week. Sorry kids. And that is, our contestants already picked. It's the
2968780	2973220	toshin and footy showdown for the res code. And if one of them is not here, then we'll
2973220	2979740	get somebody else. Because we're giving away that damn res code. It's going to happen next
2979740	2980740	week.
2980740	2986500	Yes. And another thing that's going to be happening relatively soon is a price drop
2986500	2992020	for the Xbox 360 in Asia. In fact, different price drops are happening in different regions
2992020	2998540	and all really odd percentages, but Hong Kong's getting an 11% price drop. Singapore, a 20%
2998540	3011060	price drop. Also, South Korea, a 5.1% price drop. And Taiwan, a 17% price drop. So, it's
3011060	3015980	very interesting. And I guess those price drops have already happened. They happened
3015980	3019380	earlier than last week, so.
3019380	3023620	Hooray for price drops. That makes some people very happy. Hey kids, we're going to be opening
3023620	3028100	up the Skype line very soon if you want to give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username
3028100	3032980	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but first we have a couple more quick stories for you guys.
3032980	3037960	One of them is the Famicom Mobile, or I'm sorry, the FC Mobile. I probably should say
3037960	3041380	it the other way because, you know, that would be a complete rip off of the name. But I guess,
3041380	3047020	I mean, it seems like the patent on Nintendo's thing has expired or something because all
3047020	3051860	these Nintendo knockoffs have been coming out lately. And now one of them is a mobile
3051860	3056500	system that will actually, not mobile phones, but a mobile system that will actually play
3056500	3061220	Nintendo games on the go. It can actually take the old Nintendo cartridges. It has a
3061220	3066300	2.4 inch color LCD screen. It runs on three AA batteries. It's got speakers, a place to
3066300	3070580	plug in headphones. You can plug the unit into the TV and play the NES games on the
3070580	3076620	TV. And it's being sold, I guess, overseas, but it only plays American NES games. You
3076620	3082380	can find them on eBay for 40 to 50 bucks. And that's because the patent expired for
3082380	3087180	the original NES, which makes me think in a couple of years the patent is going to expire
3087180	3090980	on the Super Nintendo, right? We're going to start seeing more and more of these as
3090980	3096300	years go on. Pretty soon, every CD player will have a PlayStation 1 in it. When that
3096300	3102340	patent expires, that's going to be interesting. We'll see. Unless they renew the patent, in
3102340	3110520	which case, then, uh oh. Now this is interesting. This is almost like seeing a unicorn, I guess.
3110520	3118540	But apparently, Shacknews website has actually seen Duke Nukem Forever, the game, in reality.
3118540	3122900	They've actually seen the real game being played. And apparently, I guess, Shacknews
3122900	3132900	is very close to 3D Realms offices. And they were shown about half an hour of footage from
3132900	3140860	the game, I guess, gameplay, including some environmental puzzles, interactivity, a host
3140860	3146580	of finished weapons, an existence of an in-game forklift, and plenty of heads and armor.
3146580	3156180	Oh my god, a forklift? Yes. What the fork? Let's see, it says, apparently, 3D Realms,
3156180	3162140	George Broussard, the developer, said, out of the blue, I just decided to show them Duke
3162140	3167100	Nukem Forever for about an hour. Well, I would like to see Duke Nukem Forever for about an
3167100	3172740	hour, and I'm sure a lot of other people would, too. I don't know, how about an idea? How
3172740	3176500	about you show the world Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour? How about you show them
3176500	3187460	for like two minutes? Is that so much to ask? Seriously. Wow. Do you think it's really,
3187460	3193020	really gonna come out? I think it will, but I think it'll underwhelm everybody. I guess
3193020	3197060	it's kind of like Prey. Even though I enjoyed Prey, it was kind of underwhelming to a lot
3197060	3200420	of people because there was so much that went into it, you know what I mean? Like, so much
3200420	3204620	hype and everything that went into it. And then I guess it kind of disappointed. And
3204620	3208660	the thing about Prey, it ended like that. The ending was just kind of out of the middle
3208660	3213220	of nowhere. It was kind of weird. I hear there's a sequel being planned, though, so we'll see
3213220	3217020	what happens with that. Alright, we're gonna open up the Skype line, finally. If you want
3217020	3225260	to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
3225260	3229740	You can always find out more about the Skype line and how it works if you go to www.orangeloungeradio.com
3229740	3234700	and click on interact with us. That gives you the whole spiel about how the Skype line
3234700	3240100	works. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? I got balls
3240100	3245980	of steel. Oh, I'm sorry, you're a little quiet. What's that, sir? I got balls of steel. You
3245980	3252300	have balls of steel. This is DJ Dark Knight. Hey, what's up, DJ Dark Knight? Oh, I see,
3252300	3257940	you're getting a little happy about the news about Duke Nukem Forever. No, just basically
3257940	3261900	doing the running gag of jokes everybody else has posted about the balls of steel thing.
3261900	3268300	Whoa, the audio quality on this call is no bueno. Something's going on there. Dark Knight,
3268300	3272500	your call quality is like really staticky and it's probably gonna drive our podcast
3272500	3276180	listeners nuts. Hurry up and get... I'm gonna give you like 10 seconds to get your question
3276180	3282740	out and then we're gonna have to let you go. Okay, just basically about the... I'm a little
3282740	3288740	bit late to the show because I've basically been testing something else out. Mostly about
3288740	3294820	the GTA 4 situation and whatnot and, I mean, how much longer do you think the man is gonna
3294820	3300580	be before it finally dies off? How long what is gonna be before it dies off? The whole...
3300580	3303940	Oh, the demand is gonna be before it dies off. All right, we'll answer your question,
3303940	3307220	Dark Knight. Take care, buddy. How long do you think it is gonna be before the demand
3307220	3310220	dies off? Well, look at all the other games that have come out. They've been selling well
3310220	3316700	for years. Hell, Granth of the Auto, San Andreas still sells really well. So, a while.
3316700	3320220	It's gonna keep selling through Christmas. Here's why, because not everybody's up to
3320220	3324500	the HDH. Here's the thing, there's this whole domino effect going on. This is why Granth
3324500	3328580	of the Auto 4 is gonna stay out there. It's because of the domino effect. By February
3328580	3334060	of 2009, lots of people are gonna have to buy new TVs. Actually, they only have to buy
3334060	3338300	digital converters for their TVs. And keep in mind, this is, I believe, America only.
3338300	3342220	I'm not sure if Canada's affected by this or other countries, but at least in America,
3342220	3347780	they have passed this thing where all television will be digital signals by February of 2009.
3347780	3352100	So, you have to get this digital converter for your television. But what's happening
3352100	3355480	is most people are getting scared. Like, they don't understand it. So, most people are just
3355480	3359660	using it to buy a new TV that has digital in it. And a lot of people, especially when
3359660	3364120	you start talking about tax rebates, the stimulus coming up and everything, they're just going
3364120	3369340	up to HDTV. Why not? And I think you're gonna see HDTVs a lot throughout the year for birthdays
3369340	3373900	and Christmas. And here's the domino effect. As people get HDTVs, then they're gonna start
3373900	3378460	buying Xbox 360s and PlayStation 3s because they're gonna wanna play Blu-ray movies on
3378460	3383960	these TVs. This is why I believe the Xbox 360 and Blu-ray thing may be true. They're
3383960	3388220	gonna wanna get that out there by Christmas because they wanna get a part of this domino
3388220	3393100	effect because they get the high-def TVs, then they're gonna buy the Blu-ray players,
3393100	3396300	and then, of course, you wanna buy games that you play on these systems. Grand Theft Auto
3396300	3399500	has a lot of name recognition. This thing will continue to sell through Christmas for
3399500	3400900	that reason. Agree?
3400900	3401900	Yes.
3401900	3402900	Yep.
3402900	3407140	All right. Good. You should always agree with me. All right. If you wanna give us a call,
3407140	3412180	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. While we wait for some calls,
3412180	3414020	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
3414020	3419660	Yes. Resistance Fall of Man 2 is gonna be playable at the PlayStation Day, which is
3419660	3426180	coming out on Tuesday, May 6th. So, I'm sure we're gonna see a lot of press releases coming
3426180	3431300	out of that, probably pretty soon. Something else also kinda tying in with PlayStation
3431300	3438740	Day. MotorStorm 2 has had a name change. Now it's being renamed MotorStorm Pacific Rift.
3438740	3443620	So, meaning it's MotorStorm 1 reskinned. Hi, caller, are you there? Who's this?
3443620	3444620	This is Spazinator.
3444620	3445620	I'm sorry?
3445620	3446620	Spazinator.
3446620	3447620	Spell that for me?
3447620	3454620	Yeah. The screen name I usually go by is Spazinator.
3454620	3458300	All right. Well, what's your question? What's on your mind, buddy?
3458300	3466420	Yeah. I was wondering, now that GTA 4 is out, do you think we're gonna be hearing from the
3466420	3473100	lawyer that we shall not name? We're gonna see you know where those lawsuits coming out
3473100	3474100	of the world work?
3474100	3478100	Absolutely, dude. We already have. He tried to get the sales of the game stopped. Here's
3478100	3483900	the thing. He's waiting. This is what this man is. He's a leech. And what's gonna happen
3483900	3489620	is the first time some poor, innocent kid gets killed by their cousin who's fucked in
3489620	3494820	the head after playing Grand Theft Auto 4, this leech is gonna leech right onto that
3494820	3499180	story and pin it on Grand Theft Auto and try to sue the makers and try to get the game
3499180	3503260	pulled from shelves. And heaven forbid if there's any hidden things this time around,
3503260	3507820	although I'm sure Take-Two took extra, extra precaution to Rockstar. They all took extra,
3507820	3511620	extra precaution to make sure there is nothing hidden on that disc.
3511620	3519980	Yeah. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there something mentioned maybe a few months
3519980	3526220	ago? You know, someone here, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but some kind of injunction
3526220	3532580	or something on this guy, you know, saying that, you know, he can't sue anyone or fucking
3532580	3533580	through that far?
3533580	3536660	I want to say Take-Two complained about him in the court, or wasn't it?
3536660	3540700	No, he's been, he's been, um, basically he has to get someone else to sign off on any
3540700	3541700	lawsuit that he does.
3541700	3542700	Oh, that was it, yeah.
3542700	3544380	But no, there is still right now a current-
3544380	3545380	But only in Florida, right?
3545380	3546380	No.
3546380	3547380	Was it? Oh.
3547380	3548380	Anywhere.
3548380	3549380	Wow.
3549380	3550380	Yeah.
3550380	3551380	Yeah.
3551380	3570100	I was going to say, one more thing, uh, before I let you guys get going to the next caller.
3570100	3575540	Um, you know, this may be just me, but I think we should probably promote this game as much
3575540	3580340	as possible, and give people the, buy this game as much as possible, just annoy the,
3580340	3583820	you know, what, as, as this lawyer, along with Hillary Clinton.
3583820	3589660	I mean, the more people these guys get, you know, at least in my book, the better, right?
3589660	3594180	What we really have to do, here's the strategy, is that, I mean, yeah, there's one way to
3594180	3598340	do it, but what we really have to try and do is not give this guy any credit.
3598340	3601300	We need to stop covering every little move he makes.
3601300	3604460	I mean, and I've used this comparison on the show before a while ago, but I haven't said
3604460	3607380	it in a while, he's the village idiot in our minds.
3607380	3611980	Every time this guy does something, we publish it, look what the village idiot did today,
3611980	3617100	you know, look at the lawsuit he filed today, you know, we need to stop giving him attention.
3617100	3621900	It's just like, you know, I don't know about you or any of our listeners or you guys, but
3621900	3625520	when I was getting bullied in school, it's happened to all of us, don't laugh Rice Princess,
3625520	3630020	but when I was getting bullied in school, my mom always said, don't pay attention to
3630020	3631420	them and they'll stop.
3631420	3635020	And to a certain extent, she was kind of right, the more you pay attention to these types
3635020	3639460	of things, they go away because they're there to ruffle feathers, it's what they do.
3639460	3642740	Yeah, you definitely get a point there.
3642740	3643740	All right.
3643740	3647220	Well, hey, we appreciate the call, do you have any last quick thoughts before we jump
3647220	3648220	to another call?
3648220	3652620	No, I think that pretty much covers it, thanks for taking my call.
3652620	3654820	No problemo, have a good night.
3654820	3656340	Bye, you too.
3656340	3658380	I like hearing from people we don't hear from too often.
3658380	3659580	Yeah, thanks for calling.
3659580	3661620	All right, yes, we appreciate that.
3661620	3663900	All right, more calls.
3663900	3664900	Now the phone's ringing off the hook.
3664900	3666620	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry, who's this?
3666620	3668260	Hey, hey, it's Ronma.
3668260	3672660	Ronma, I noticed the comment you just made in chat, bullshit, even if you do ignore bullies,
3672660	3676380	they will keep at it.
3676380	3681540	My problem was I got bullied in school, I ignored them, it kept going to the point where
3681540	3685260	I actually had to throw my fists up and get to a few fistfights.
3685260	3693020	I know, I realize that times have also changed from when I was a kid.
3693020	3698660	But I don't know, it's just, I always kind of think a lot of people do things for attention
3698660	3703420	and obviously there's extremes in every circumstance where people are just fucked in the head,
3703420	3706980	but a lot of times people do things for attention, if you don't give them attention, it'll go
3706980	3708020	away.
3708020	3712620	But there are people that just are sick, I don't know what else to say.
3712620	3713620	Let's talk about happier things.
3713620	3715900	So what did you call in to call in about tonight?
3715900	3717660	Talk more about Mario Kart Wii.
3717660	3718660	Wii!
3718660	3719900	Why aren't you on my friends list yet?
3719900	3720900	I added you.
3720900	3725740	Well, when you posted your code, I was away for Sakura Matsuri at a friend's house when
3725740	3726740	we got home.
3726740	3729580	We were playing Mario Kart Wii until about 5 o'clock in the morning.
3729580	3731940	You're not having that much fun with it, eh?
3731940	3736260	Yeah, I'm playing on the Classic Controller, everybody else is playing on GameCube Controllers.
3736260	3740140	I can't play on the Cube Controller so well, but I can rock on the Classic Controller without
3740140	3741140	any problems.
3741140	3742140	Wiimote Nunchuck for me.
3742140	3743140	I find controlling is easier on that.
3743140	3745140	Wiimote Nunchuck for me.
3745140	3748980	I tried it for a while, but I found I just couldn't get the controller with the thumb
3748980	3749980	tool.
3749980	3753140	I was like losing it, but it's like more natural with the Classic Controller.
3753140	3757460	I keep thinking of Super Mario Kart.
3757460	3760740	Do you think this is the best Mario Kart yet, or do you think it's somewhere in the middle,
3760740	3761740	or worse?
3761740	3766840	It's somewhere in the middle, because I really dig Mario Kart DS more.
3766840	3770780	But it's that, you know how they say they remove snaking and so forth?
3770780	3772940	If you do it right, you can still do it.
3772940	3777660	I just find it easier to do quote-unquote snaking and power boosting with the control
3777660	3779500	stick than I could with the control pad.
3779500	3783700	You know what's interesting though, is I find online, it doesn't seem like people are cheating
3783700	3789820	as much, because you have a lot of people on there that are playing with the wheel,
3789820	3790820	for one.
3790820	3791820	I noticed that.
3791820	3792820	There's tons of people online.
3792820	3793820	Yeah, a lot of people on the wheel.
3793820	3797380	And you know, it just seems like there's less cheating going on.
3797380	3799520	The only cheating in the game, and something I really should have mentioned in part A when
3799520	3802980	I review the game, here's the irritation I have with the game.
3802980	3806060	The items, I realize is a part of Mario Kart, it's got to be there.
3806060	3807460	It's a little much.
3807460	3810940	They really needed to scale back, and I think part of that might have to do with them expanding
3810940	3813380	it from like 8 to 12 cars at once.
3813380	3817020	There is just too many freaking blue shells that show up, you know what I mean?
3817020	3818020	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
3818020	3819020	A little much.
3819020	3822860	You ought to be able to turn some of that shit off when playing online.
3822860	3823860	Not yet, no.
3823860	3824860	Can you turn items off?
3824860	3825860	You can turn items off.
3825860	3826860	Oh, nice.
3826860	3828460	Well, all together, but you can't single one out.
3828460	3831300	Yeah, it'll be nice if they give you a little more customization when you just turn off
3831300	3832300	blue shells.
3832300	3835300	They have it where you can do like, you know, the powerful items will appear less, will
3835300	3840740	appear more, appear normal, but to be honest, playing through each different mode, I have
3840740	3843980	not noticed a difference.
3843980	3850900	Well, I have noticed that when you're in first place with probably Mario Kart games, all
3850900	3854500	you had at your disposal were banana peels and green turtle shells.
3854500	3860140	I've noticed now you're getting more powerful items like red turtle shells and other items
3860140	3861140	too, you know?
3861140	3865520	Once in a blue moon you get a red turtle shell, but you never get a bullet and you never get
3865520	3866520	a blue shell.
3866520	3867520	Well, obviously.
3867520	3870260	But I've gotten a lot of red shells being in first place, but I've also noticed that
3870260	3875940	when I'm in first place, a shitload of shells just hit me out of nowhere.
3875940	3881860	Sometimes the best strategy online, honestly, is to stay in second and hang onto a golden
3881860	3884780	mushroom for the end if you can get one.
3884780	3888180	Have you checked out the Super NES tracks on the game yet?
3888180	3892660	Um, yeah, like I, well, I'm only a little bit through, like I played all the new tracks
3892660	3895700	and now I'm working my way through the bot, I'm only on 50cc, okay, because I was playing
3895700	3899900	online for a long time, but I did play the Ghost Valley is in the first set and that
3899900	3900900	was pretty cool.
3900900	3906100	Yeah, I just love how they brought back the original power boosters and not a remix theme,
3906100	3910260	the original themes, that's, I was really enjoying that.
3910260	3915100	It seems like they've still been slightly retouched, but they're, it's still, it's quality.
3915100	3917260	It's not, you know, they didn't ruin them.
3917260	3920940	Now, Sky, before I go, let me ask you to see if you agree with me.
3920940	3925740	With the Wiimote and Nunchuck controller, do you think it should have been more natural
3925740	3930700	to use the Wiimote when you shake it to throw an item instead of doing tricks?
3930700	3935340	No, because I think it might be too sensitive and sometimes, you know, you get a little
3935340	3937740	excited, you kind of move around, you hop around, especially if you're getting in the
3937740	3938740	heat of it.
3938740	3942540	You just have a bad feeling that it would, and I sit kind of far away from the TV, so
3942540	3946380	when I'm playing, the sensitivity is kind of, or, you know, if I'm trying to like point
3946380	3947380	at the screen, it's really hard.
3947380	3949180	I've got to lean forward to get at the screen.
3949180	3953500	I just have a bad feeling it would screw things up.
3953500	3957640	Probably with all the precautions they tell you, I think it'd just be more fun, you know,
3957640	3960120	to shake the Wiimote to throw the item.
3960120	3964660	But then again, some of us are a little bit too heavy-handed and we'll send it flying
3964660	3970420	across the room, and we just got a new 32-inch HDTV, and if that happens, somebody's getting
3970420	3971420	their neck snapped.
3971420	3972420	I'll meet you halfway.
3972420	3975700	They ought to add custom controls where you can assign whatever you want.
3975700	3976700	Agreed.
3976700	3977700	All right.
3977700	3983460	Rama, thanks so much for the call, and really quickly, OLRCon, what's up with this?
3983460	3986180	Is there a big meeting happening somewhere here that we need to go to?
3986180	3989180	Do we need to rent out the Elk's Lodge for a night?
3989180	3991900	It's pretty much my return to the West Coast like you wanted me to.
3991900	3992900	All right.
3992900	3994220	What's that?
3994220	3996820	It's my return to the West Coast like everybody wanted me to.
3996820	4000140	And he said, well, we've got to figure out where we're getting together and have an
4000140	4001140	apartheid.
4001140	4005900	Well, I do know, I am crashing on Doc Sakura's couch for three days, which would be pretty
4005900	4008100	awesome, and I will be bringing some stuff.
4008100	4011240	And I'll probably bring some New York City trinkets as well.
4011240	4012580	It's Fourth of July weekend?
4012580	4013580	Mm-hmm.
4013580	4017700	You know, if it wasn't summer, I'd say let's have a late birthday party for me at Roseville
4017700	4020620	Golf Land, but it's summer and that's going to suck.
4020620	4022860	Well, we can kind of make an agreement.
4022860	4025540	My birthday's past, too, maybe we could do something like that together.
4025540	4026700	We'll figure something out.
4026700	4028020	All right, we'll talk more about it offline.
4028020	4029020	The listeners don't want to hear about it.
4029020	4030020	All right.
4030020	4031020	Take care, buddy.
4031020	4032020	You, too.
4032020	4033020	All right.
4033020	4034020	Bye.
4034020	4035020	Bye.
4035020	4036980	But if you're in Northern California, specifically the Sacramento area, you might want to stay
4036980	4039140	tuned the next few episodes because we're going to do something.
4039140	4041300	I know we have some listeners in the SAC area.
4041300	4043940	Loki, quickly, any other last minute stories?
4043940	4044940	Yes.
4044940	4046540	Let's see here.
4046540	4054580	The ESRB has added some more Xbox Live Arcade games to their list of stuff coming out, including
4054580	4065700	Samurai Showdown 2, of course, Red Baron for the arcade, Red Baron arcade, which is interesting,
4065700	4069580	and the Revenge of the Plague Lord, but we knew that was coming.
4069580	4074420	That was for Puzzle Quest, the expansion.
4074420	4075420	Let's see.
4075420	4079260	This is an interesting turn for download content for Rock Band.
4079260	4086380	Apparently, Best Buy is running an offer where if you pre-order Disturb's new album, you
4086380	4095180	actually will get a code for two free downloadable Rock Band tracks for the actual album, including
4095180	4105380	Indestructible, which is the cover track for that, and Inside the Fire.
4105380	4113500	That's kind of interesting, and then, let's see here, Guitar Hero 3 this week will be
4113500	4121920	getting three songs from Muse, including, let's see, Exopolitics, Supermassive, Black
4121920	4131020	Hole, and Stockholm Syndrome, and they're going to cost 500 Microsoft points, and one
4131020	4135360	other thing we talked a little bit about earlier with the Virtual Console and people hacking
4135360	4136360	it.
4136360	4141980	Now, they've already hacked and pirated WiiWare games, and they have actually brought over
4141980	4147340	some of the Japanese WiiWare games to the North American Virtual Console.
4147340	4151300	You can actually find those online if you're into that kind of thing, but I just think
4151300	4161500	it's funny how quickly they've hacked those apart already.
4161500	4163220	And that's pretty much it.
4163220	4170900	Oh, and a rumor of a Blu-ray console coming to the market, or a Blu-ray-included 360 coming
4170900	4174220	to the market in third quarter, although I don't believe that, but we'll see.
4174220	4177100	You know, I was listening to Bobby show a little bit, and he made a pretty good argument
4177100	4180400	for why it is happening, and plus, I think what I said earlier about the whole domino
4180400	4183740	effect, I think it's damn well possible something like that's going to happen.
4183740	4185160	It's just a matter of time.
4185160	4189740	I think it's just going to be hard with alienating their customers, but if they only use it for
4189740	4191980	video playback, then that's fine.
4191980	4195660	As long as they don't start coming out with Blu-ray games, I absolutely agree with you
4195660	4196660	there.
4196660	4198020	I absolutely agree with you there.
4198020	4199020	Let's go to the phones.
4199020	4200020	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4200020	4201020	Who's this?
4201020	4202020	Who's PT?
4202020	4203580	Hey, Dark Dead Tsuya.
4203580	4204580	What is on your mind, my friend?
4204580	4205580	I don't know.
4205580	4209060	I was trying to get in, but it kept going to voicemail.
4209060	4212060	Yeah, well, we were letting Loki do some last minute stories for a little bit before we
4212060	4213060	opened it back up.
4213060	4214060	What's on your mind?
4214060	4215060	Okay.
4215060	4216060	Oh, sure.
4216060	4217060	Ron?
4217060	4218060	Huh?
4218060	4219060	We're here.
4219060	4220060	What's up?
4220060	4225700	You might have to lower the speakers in your house because you're probably hearing feedback.
4225700	4226700	Yeah.
4226700	4227700	Oh, well, sorry.
4227700	4228700	Yeah.
4228700	4229700	Okay.
4229700	4230700	I got it.
4230700	4231700	So, yeah.
4231700	4238780	Rama has OLRCon, but I had OLR Central in October.
4238780	4241300	We have competing conventions going on.
4241300	4247740	Apparently, there's... Rama's OLRCon is happening in July, and then we have... Misty's coming
4247740	4249140	out here, right?
4249140	4250140	Yeah.
4250140	4253860	We have the Misty Dark Tetsuya OLR Central, or whatever they're calling it, happening
4253860	4254860	in October.
4254860	4255860	And none of which I've heard of.
4255860	4256860	So, it's awesome.
4256860	4259260	No, I think they've talked about the October thing before.
4259260	4260260	Here's the deal, buddy.
4260260	4261700	We'll make time.
4261700	4263580	The year is a long time.
4263580	4265500	Definitely, we want to meet Misty.
4265500	4267960	Definitely, we want to entertain Rama while he's here.
4267960	4269140	You know what?
4269140	4272220	If other strangers from the internet want to fly out here, why not?
4272220	4273220	Come on over.
4273220	4275900	We'll have a party.
4275900	4278620	My roommate's probably going to kill me for saying that.
4278620	4279620	Good idea.
4279620	4280620	He loves that idea.
4280620	4281620	But, you know, whatever.
4281620	4283300	We'll make time for it all.
4283300	4284300	I'm not worried about it.
4284300	4287540	And then somebody's going to say, let's do OLR Expo in August.
4287540	4290580	Yes, there totally are.
4290580	4291580	It is all good.
4291580	4292580	We will have fun.
4292580	4296540	You know, in October is enough time to cool down from July, from all the partying we're
4296540	4297540	going to do with Rama's here.
4297540	4301500	We'll be good to go again for some Olive Garden, Home of the Never Ending Breadsticks, and
4301500	4302500	all of that.
4302500	4303500	Yeah.
4303500	4304500	All right.
4304500	4305500	Anything else on your mind?
4305500	4306500	Or an iron.
4306500	4307500	Anything else on your mind, Dark Tetsuya?
4307500	4313500	I don't know, I was thinking about that portable Famicom thing.
4313500	4314500	That sounded pretty cool.
4314500	4315500	Yeah, I know.
4315500	4319980	You know, it's not too bad, $40 or $50, considering it's portable and everything, and what an
4319980	4320980	awesome piece of retro.
4320980	4322940	I'm going to have to ask Jamie if she's going to pick up one of those.
4322940	4323940	I hear it just plays Nintendo.
4323940	4324940	Oh, sorry.
4324940	4325940	Yeah, and you know.
4325940	4328140	I hear it just plays Nintendo games.
4328140	4329140	It does.
4329140	4330140	It does.
4330140	4331140	It doesn't play any of the other stuff.
4331140	4333580	But, you know, I was thinking, well, where would you actually be able to get Nintendo
4333580	4334580	games?
4334580	4335900	Because, you know, everybody stopped carrying them a long time ago.
4335900	4340100	Like, flea markets and garage sales, you can pick shit up for, like, 50 cents a month.
4340100	4344460	Game cra- or, not game crazies, but, uh, playing trades, I think, still carry Nintendo.
4344460	4347260	Okay, like, there's one of those stores in the Sacramento region.
4347260	4349660	You've got to think bigger, big stores.
4349660	4350660	They're a chain.
4350660	4351660	Oh, yeah.
4351660	4352660	There's, like, there's, like, 300 stores.
4352660	4353660	What?
4353660	4354660	In the U.S.
4354660	4355660	I thought there was only one of them here.
4355660	4356660	No.
4356660	4357660	Oh, funny.
4357660	4358660	Okay, my bad.
4358660	4363060	No, um, and then there's also, uh, well, locally, we've got a record store, um, Dimple.
4363060	4364640	They carry NES games.
4364640	4365640	You know, when I-
4365640	4372220	When I was in New York City for, uh, NYOLRCon, when I was there, um, last year, we actually
4372220	4375980	all went to a video game store, and, uh, they had old Nintendo games.
4375980	4380300	I remember because I found a copy of the Guardian Legend, which I bought for my friend who let
4380300	4381940	me stay at her place in New York City.
4381940	4385220	She lives in Brooklyn, and she has an old school Nintendo, and I bought it for her,
4385220	4389100	and I said, Amanda, that's her name, Amanda, I said, Amanda, this is the best video game
4389100	4390300	of all time.
4390300	4391460	You need to treasure this game.
4391460	4393540	I don't think the bitch has played it yet.
4393540	4395580	She's too busy with WoW.
4395580	4401380	Cause Irene, I know Irene called her and was like, Amanda, Karazhan, even though I don't
4401380	4405460	think Irene's ever talked to her, but anyway, Video Games New York was the name of the store
4405460	4410460	according to Rama, so, alright, DT, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you
4410460	4411460	go?
4411460	4415420	Oh, well, I just hope, uh, Granny Sue comes out in the US.
4415420	4416420	What?
4416420	4417420	Two comes out in the US?
4417420	4418420	Granny Sue.
4418420	4419420	Ooh, I hope so too.
4419420	4423300	I, you know what, I think the odds of seeing that are much more than Choaniki here in the
4423300	4424300	US.
4424300	4425300	Oh God, yeah.
4425300	4428700	Alright, DT, take care, have a good week, okay?
4428700	4429700	And we'll see you in October.
4429700	4430700	Yeah, you too.
4430700	4431700	Alright.
4431700	4432700	See you later.
4432700	4433700	Bye bye.
4433700	4434700	Although you should really come to the July one too, if you can.
4434700	4436700	You should come to both.
4436700	4440380	Alright, this is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.
4440380	4443740	We're gonna go ahead and start to close out the show, cause it's getting late.
4443740	4446940	Considering it was a slow news week, we did a good job filling up three hours.
4446940	4448660	I'm quite proud of the cast tonight.
4448660	4451660	Alright, so, uh, we gotta go around and get everybody's final thought.
4451660	4453740	Loki, do you have a final thought?
4453740	4457580	More Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.
4457580	4459420	Rice Princess, thank you for being here this week.
4459420	4461140	Appreciate you being here as always.
4461140	4464940	And by the way, thank you so much for stealing the mushroom that, um, Eddie the Gay.
4464940	4467360	Uh, no, he, okay, he had four of them.
4467360	4469100	He gave one to me and three to you.
4469100	4471220	You didn't take- I've totally forgot today.
4471220	4472220	I'm gonna get them though.
4472220	4473220	Then that's your own damn call.
4473220	4474220	For the studio.
4474220	4475220	And a question mark block.
4475220	4476220	Yeah, oh, you should hang it too.
4476220	4477220	I'm, we're getting it.
4477220	4478220	We're gonna hang the question mark block for the ceiling.
4478220	4480140	I'm gonna put a tack and hang the question mark block and then we'll put the mushrooms
4480140	4481140	around.
4481140	4483740	And then we can put, like, Cartman and some of these other things they see on Justin TV,
4483740	4485060	uh, on the mushrooms.
4485060	4489140	But first we have to fix Justin TV by actually wiring the Mac in because the, the feed on
4489140	4491580	Justin TV sucks right now, so we gotta fix that.
4491580	4496040	By the way, speaking of Justin TV, real quick, did you hear about some of our, um, uh, friends
4496040	4498260	over on Justin TV got their stream shut down?
4498260	4500340	Take Two put the smack down just for a day.
4500340	4501500	They only got a 24 hour ban.
4501500	4505180	They got some archives deleted, but apparently there was a big crackdown from Take Two on
4505180	4508700	people broadcasting Grand Theft Auto 4 and, like, All Games was one of them that got their,
4508700	4511820	some of their archives deleted and, cause they were showing the game, you know, they're
4511820	4514140	broadcasting the game for, like, two days.
4514140	4518780	And Take Two did not like that, even though it's free publicity, I guess they just didn't
4518780	4519780	like that.
4519780	4520780	That's ridiculous.
4520780	4523740	Cause they weren't one of the approved media outlets probably.
4523740	4524740	Wow.
4524740	4526900	Cause you know those people have the exclusives.
4526900	4527900	We had to hide our footage.
4527900	4528900	Our footage is still there.
4528900	4529900	We had to hide it.
4529900	4530900	But we only did, like, ten minutes.
4530900	4531900	And it was like-
4531900	4534140	And if they had shut us down for ten, I would have thrown a fit because, like, IGN and these
4534140	4536940	other sites probably have way more than ten minutes worth of video.
4536940	4540300	They're all on YouTube now, too, so it's retarded.
4540300	4543900	Although ShadowNextGen in chat says a bunch of YouTube videos were deleted, too.
4543900	4545020	That's just stupid.
4545020	4546540	Free publicity for your game.
4546540	4548540	But see, they're just bullies.
4548540	4551660	You know, I would say we should boycott them, but who's gonna fucking boycott Grand Theft
4551660	4552660	Auto 4?
4552660	4553660	We should ignore them, Rob.
4553660	4554660	Let's stop talking about it right now.
4554660	4555660	Well, that's fine.
4555660	4556660	I'll boycott their other smaller games.
4556660	4557660	Good idea.
4557660	4558660	You know, they've got the 2K series.
4558660	4561460	Well, I don't like sports, so that's fine.
4561460	4566940	They've got their stupid, what, tennis game, their Rockstar's Table Tennis.
4566940	4568260	Fuck your table tennis in the ass.
4568260	4570020	I ain't playing that shit.
4570020	4576640	And then they've got, well, they've got Dora the Explorer, which is shit.
4576640	4583060	They've also got, well, they've got Mafia, which is coming out, and Noir, but, you know,
4583060	4588620	when the fuck are those gonna come out, like, forever, you know, from now?
4588620	4589620	That's fine.
4589620	4590620	All I buy is Grand Theft Auto.
4590620	4591620	That's fine.
4591620	4592620	All right.
4592620	4594380	Any final thoughts from you, Rice Princess?
4594380	4597780	Thank you for being here tonight and giving us a female perspective when DarkSakura was
4597780	4598780	unable to.
4598780	4599780	You're welcome.
4599780	4600780	All right.
4600780	4601780	Any final thoughts?
4601780	4603420	I'm gonna get myself a banana.
4603420	4606140	No one gets that.
4606140	4607440	That's all right.
4607440	4612140	My final thought is, actually, a fruit salad sounds pretty yummy right now.
4612140	4613140	Yummy, yummy.
4613140	4614140	Yummy, yummy.
4614140	4615140	Yeah, I know.
4615140	4616140	I don't get that.
4616140	4617140	All right.
4617140	4618140	That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundredo.
4618140	4621820	If you're here, here on Orange Laundredo, please tell two friends about our show.
4621820	4622820	Tell two enemies about our show.
4622820	4623820	I don't care.
4623820	4626460	Just tell two people about our show, because that's how word of mouth spreads, and more
4626460	4633020	people everywhere find out about Orange Lounge Radio, and without you and your support, independent
4633020	4634020	radio would be dead.
4634020	4636100	But thanks to you, it's still alive.
4636100	4639060	You know, I heard that, because I've given out our cards during the Zappos.
4639060	4643140	I was, like, just about to play the outgoing music, but what, what, Loki?
4643140	4646900	I was hitting on our cards at the Zappos thing, and they're gonna put it on their little blog
4646900	4647900	site.
4647900	4648900	Really?
4648900	4649900	How nice of them.
4649900	4650900	Awesome.
4650900	4651900	All right.
4651900	4652900	Cool.
4652900	4653900	We're getting out there a little more.
4653900	4654900	Woohoo, woohoo.
4654900	4655900	All right.
4655900	4656900	That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundredo.
4656900	4658980	Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.
4658980	4663900	She's not Dark Sakura, but she will be next week, and he's Loki, and Rice Princess helped,
4663900	4664900	and we're Orange Laundredo.
4664900	4665900	Have a good week.
4665900	4669900	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
