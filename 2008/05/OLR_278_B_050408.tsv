19790	33562	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time, but you're probably thinking to yourself, but hey, Rob, it's about 7.30 in the evening Pacific, or 10.30 Eastern.
33582	41709	That's because it's time for Part B of our podcast, which goes out to the podcast feed, usually on Wednesdays, Thursdays if I'm having an especially

114583	114864	Awesome.
115504	119208	Alright, just for being silly and recording it for our mutual enjoyment.
119548	122291	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news here on Part B of Orange Launch Radio.
122331	123212	Loki, take it away.
124249	125970	All right, let's see here.
126231	137319	Well, this is kind of interesting because I know they haven't been doing too well for the longest time, but Atari is actually being bought up by Infogrames for $11 million.
138240	147447	And the announced, I guess, merger, they're going to buy the remaining stock of Atari, of course, for $11 million, and that will immediately lend...
148387	174649	20 million dollars to the company before the deal closes and although it's hard to really say what's going to happen although Infogrames only had 51.4 controlling interest in Atari 51.4% looks like doesn't really sound like what kind of changes are going to happen after this but I guess it's nice for Atari to have a little bit more financial backing
176656	177797	Well, here's the thing, though.
178097	180299	Essentially, Atari's been sold for $11 million.
180379	181300	Is that what I'm to understand?
181800	181960	Yeah.
182160	184662	I mean, $11 million is not that much money.
184682	185703	I mean, don't get me wrong.
185783	186444	I'd gladly take it.
186464	186984	Let me put it this way.
187004	189466	A bar company that I work for could have bought Atari.
189766	190667	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
190747	194170	I'm like, dude, this is the company that is like my childhood.
194410	198653	I mean, like little childhood, like when I was like three, was when the Atari 2600 was big, but still...
200675	203577	It's kind of weird to think that... Why hasn't EA bought them?
203637	207380	I mean, seriously, it's just like, poof, snapped them up like nothing.
207480	216067	I mean, I know that they may not be interested in per se them, but a bigger portfolio is not a bad thing.
216127	225655	I mean, granted, it sounds like there's some other stuff involved here, like they're loaning them $20 million and stuff, so maybe it's not fair to say they're only getting sold for $11 million, but still, that's kind of what it comes off as.
226813	227934	It's just kind of weird.
228214	233577	It'd be like if someone sold Nintendo 20 years from now for like, I don't know, $15, $20.
233637	234378	A bag of peanuts.
234658	236779	I mean, that would be like, it would be weird.
236799	243923	Of course, it was also weird to see the Sega logo on a Nintendo game like years ago when F-Zero came out.
244144	245224	It was all weird.
245584	246085	It is weird.
246821	248482	and Sephiroth1215 in our chat room.
248522	252905	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com says, Too bad most Atari or Infogrames games suck.
253205	257248	The Dragon Ball Z games are good, but I'm really sick of them now because they just do the same thing every year.
257568	258829	I mean, I guess that is the sad thing.
258869	261330	Atari honestly hasn't had a lot going for it recently.
261350	262451	See, that would have been perfect.
262531	264112	You could have had Dragon Ball Z 2008 or 2009 for EA.
267742	270363	Although I have to admit, I did kind of want one of those flashback consoles.
270383	273805	I mean, it's not like I can't still get one, but you know, flashback consoles are cool.
275165	277907	So I guess there you have it.
278729	284975	More to develop on that, or more news on that, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, including what the joint projects will be in the future.
285856	287517	Let's talk about QMotions.
288078	290420	They are a subsidiary of Actiga.
291140	292001	They're a gaming company.
292121	295124	They apparently have made some sort of agreement with Microsoft.
295444	302751	They're going to be using the wireless technology that QMotions has for types of active gaming controllers for the Xbox 360.
304032	310055	Q-Motions has made these large controllers for golf, baseball, and snowboarding.
310116	313497	I want to say I've seen this before.
313557	317279	I want to say one of those times They sell them at Best Buy, I think.
317760	325424	I want to say one of those times we were on All Games Interactive last year or a couple years ago.
325484	326965	They had one of these in the house.
326985	328986	They just acquired one there.
329006	330287	I think that was the same thing.
331087	332810	So they know how to make these types of controllers.
332830	337917	Well, apparently Microsoft is getting in on this now for who knows what type of project.
337957	343404	But it kind of makes sense, you know, with the Wii doing as well as it is, Microsoft wants a piece of it somehow.
343465	344866	So they'll buy somebody else to do it.
345606	346507	Make an agreement to do it.
347847	353151	The press release stated that the first controller that will be coming out will be a big air wireless controller.
353191	357553	It's a full-size skateboard that will work with skateboarding games.
357613	359074	I mean, this is pretty high-end stuff.
359114	364497	This isn't something that, you know, a gamer that doesn't have a lot of money can pick up.
364817	368399	But still, I mean, if you really want to get immersed in your games, I guess this is the way to do it.
369320	371201	This is what they should be setting up at the Westin.
371902	374203	I mean, this is the kind of thing you don't get to play every day.
375759	376119	There you have it.
376139	376880	What do you think, Loki?
376920	378821	Is this the type of thing you would be interested in at all?
379461	379741	No.
380161	380502	Why not?
381262	381602	I don't know.
381622	386785	It sounds like, as Alton Brown would put it, it's a uni-tasker.
387466	388946	And no one likes a uni-tasker.
389667	389987	Wow.
390267	390707	Nerd.
391328	393989	Only you would quote the Food Network here on our program.
394930	395110	Hey.
396058	397619	XBOX LIVE XBOX LIVE
420656	423419	for 1,600 Microsoft points, also $20.
423579	428723	It will also make it the most expensive Xbox Live Arcade game to date.
430224	433487	Yeah, but if you add up all the parts in Luminous, it's a little more expensive.
433927	439352	That is true, but still though, out of the gate though, this is the most expensive Xbox Live Arcade game.
440012	443215	And probably going to set a disturbing trend among games.
443315	445076	Hey, they're going to buy it for $20.
445477	447058	Let's put out our crappy game for $20.
447098	447158	So...
449881	452663	I don't know, but you kind of sense that Penny Arcade's going to be able to get away with it.
452843	455745	I mean, it's all about if the game is good, but at least the IP is good.
455985	463049	Yeah, I mean, if it's a full game, I mean, they'll be awesome, but I just have a bad feeling, though, that other companies are going to look at this and go, hey, you know what?
463089	467051	We can get our game to be $20, too, and they'll sell it and it'll be shit.
467192	472795	Well, if some little internet comic can get $20 for their game, then we ought to be able to sell our game for $20.
473055	476677	You do that too well, Rob.
477858	479439	I've been snooping in on boardrooms.
481330	482151	How about Macintosh?
483651	484091	Who cares?
485392	486332	The chat room's asking.
489033	489714	No love, I guess.
490234	492635	So do we know anything about the actual game?
495416	496857	There's screenshots and stuff out there.
496877	498777	I haven't done a lot of research on the game.
498997	501719	It is gone gold for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
502359	502979	Well, there you have it.
503619	503879	Awesome.
504620	506140	So you can't say you don't have anything to play on the Mac.
506961	508521	I don't know a lot about this game.
508741	509962	Isn't it kind of like a
511405	512286	Adventure type game?
512487	514069	It's like an adventure game.
514109	518995	Kind of think of a cross between one of the LucasArts adventure games and Final Fantasy.
519396	523562	So you've got the turn-based fighting in there as well.
523582	525584	It's all the Penny Arcade humor.
526546	526806	I don't know.
528370	530231	It looks really cool.
530571	533993	Well, Rock Band has made some progress, a lot of progress.
534013	537955	This game, of course, just on about every console out there, except the Wii right now.
538315	541836	It's out on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, right?
541876	543057	Don't they have a version of this on PS2?
543477	544798	Well, it's out there everywhere.
545378	549240	They've announced that they have sold 3 million copies of the game.
550460	554021	10 million rock band songs have been downloaded.
554641	557802	4 million of those since March 20th, just about 6 weeks ago.
558503	559043	Damn.
559203	561564	So, yeah, 3 million copies of the game, 10 million.
561764	565485	That means on the average, people are buying 3 or 4 songs a pop.
565925	567626	And how much do each song cost?
568386	571947	About 2 bucks, depending on what platform and what song.
572950	579292	So on average about... I'm wondering if they're counting those albums as 12 songs sold though, but I guess they can because they charge more for those.
580952	582432	How many people really bought that album?
582472	583232	I'm sure there's plenty.
583733	584173	Don't get me wrong.
584213	585073	I'm not bashing the artists.
585093	586253	I bought a lot of songs on there.
586353	588074	I bought quite a few too, I gotta admit.
588474	589334	I don't know why I buy them.
589434	593835	I don't either, but it's the ultimate party game because you're glad to have them when people are over.
594485	595445	You guys are so funny.
596025	598066	I don't know why I buy them, but I bought them.
598106	600287	I have those Microsoft points burning a hole in my pocket.
600427	602107	I'm telling you, that's why that stuff is evil.
602507	607249	Because Microsoft, it's so easy to just press that one little button and spend Microsoft points.
607469	610149	If you need to reload, just add more points.
610229	610850	It's dangerous.
610870	613130	It's like you're not spending money, you're just spending points.
613150	613810	Exactly.
613870	615791	I don't notice it until I look at my bank statement.
615871	619992	and I go, son of a bitch, I just bought like 40 bucks worth of Microsoft points this month.
620392	621632	What do I have to speak for it?
622192	623092	I bought Jairus.
624072	626373	That's pretty smart, though, that they get the points.
626393	626953	It is.
626973	627473	Scary.
628393	628553	Oh.
629473	629693	What?
630533	630714	What?
630734	632734	We're going off the tangent train, unfortunately.
632754	633514	Oh, dear God.
633534	634174	All right, what's up?
634554	638515	I'm sorry, you know, because you know me, I'm looking up last minute stories and stuff.
638535	639035	Sure, sure.
639775	644616	And I had to mention this because it just, poof, they had a big little thing in the corner of the screen here.
645615	661570	Apparently, at Maker Faire 2008 today, MacGyver creator Lee David Zlotoff announced that he is making a big budget MacGyver movie.
662551	663212	Fuck yeah.
663232	663312	Yeah.
663806	666447	Yeah, but they're bastardizing everything we love in the 80s.
666467	668789	There's an A-Team movie coming out, too.
669069	671530	Why didn't they make these movies when they were popular?
671610	672371	I don't understand.
672431	674072	When MacGyver was still on the air.
674192	675392	It's the whole retro thing.
675432	677614	It's just like a few years ago, 70s retro.
677634	678974	They remade Charlie's Angels.
679014	680135	They remade the Brady Bunch.
680895	681956	Now the 80s are coming.
682276	684777	Dude, it's just a matter of time before we get the Facts of Life movie.
685398	686979	Who would they cast as Natalie and Tootie?
687599	688419	I don't know.
688519	688900	Tootie.
690034	691275	I don't know, I just kind of think it's a no.
691315	699220	Rumor is the movie will be made out of a shoelace, paper clips, and a jar of peanut butter.
699240	700800	Can you take us back to video games, please?
700841	701261	Sorry.
702121	702622	Anyways.
704543	709366	So yeah, there's some interesting news coming out with...
711612	713694	Guitar Hero, Aerosmith
734850	736872	A length of time, but I mean, God, who cares?
737192	743298	Meaning there's an escape clause in it should Guitar Hero tank in the near future so Aerosmith can get in on the other game.
744259	744499	Yeah.
744559	745180	It's gotta be that.
746274	757619	It says, apparently, excluding, I guess, Rock Band's train kept on rolling, Aerosmith's entire catalog of rock and roll hits will be exclusive to Guitar Hero.
758220	767284	And it says, Newsweek got confirmation that the Aerosmith publicist and Activision PR that the band's songs would be locked down for an unspecified period of time.
767624	770105	So that is for a limited amount of time.
770125	771966	Meaning there's an escape clause, just in case.
772386	772586	Yeah.
772946	773606	And you know what?
773747	774087	I mean...
775233	775633	Thanks for watching!
790695	791095	All right.
791996	793596	Well, you know, I don't know.
794397	797478	I have a real problem with this kind of stuff because I see this as the beginning.
797818	801540	It's the little pebble that starts the snowball that starts the avalanche.
801980	810064	Because we all know, you know, we heard last week Guitar Hero 4 is supposedly following in rock bands' footsteps where they're going to be adding voice, they're going to be adding drums, possibly.
810084	811405	I mean, a lot of it's speculation.
811705	815307	You know, we know there's... But the thing is, we'll both play nice.
816187	820050	or am I going to have to have two of everything like Noah's freaking Ark in my gaming closet?
820070	822912	If it's up to Activision, if it's up to Activision, then no, they won't.
823352	825974	But if it's up to Microsoft, then yes, they will.
826154	832719	And you remember, Microsoft, they have strict regulations about their accessories and peripherals that they all have to play nice with each other.
833240	833980	Well, you know what?
834380	836762	That shit pisses me off if they don't play nice.
836862	839024	And when I get pissed off, we do the FUs of the week.
854266	856809	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight since DarkSakura is not here?
857329	864897	F you to Gravity for pulling the mustard out of my sandwich and staining my shirt and my shorts with delicious mustard.
867799	870943	Rice Princess, since you're filling in tonight, would you care to give an F you for anything?
871884	875767	F you to Hollywood After Dark for showing Rue McClanahan stripping.
878088	880309	Do we need to describe Bad Movie Night really quick?
880349	881089	Yeah, do it, do it.
881129	882069	Give him a rundown of Bad Movie Night.
882089	883649	You haven't talked at all tonight.
884209	884649	All right, man.
884709	888950	Okay, Bad Movie Night is where we pick bad movies, bad but entertaining movies to watch.
889210	890671	Sadly, none of my movies got picked.
890771	896532	I brought Follow That Bird, the Sesame Street adaptation from 1980s, but my choice was not Scream last night.
896712	899032	It wasn't bad enough, I guess.
899092	900493	It wasn't that bad of a movie.
900573	901853	It was just a classic.
902867	903648	We're all pushing 30.
904108	905789	It's pretty bad in retrospect.
905809	906090	No.
906430	906750	No, no.
906790	914536	Okay, we watched Sleepaway Camp, which I've seen numerous times, but there were a few people that hadn't seen it yet, so that's funny.
914636	918399	I swear to God I'll ban you from chat if you ruin the twist ending to Sleepaway Camp.
918679	919460	Yeah, do not do it.
919480	922362	Best twist ending ever in a movie, Sleepaway Camp.
922402	923723	And if you haven't seen it, watch it.
923763	927746	You need to watch it, and I swear to God, strap yourself to the chair and force yourself to watch it.
928007	929107	The twist ending is worth it.
929228	930709	Yeah, just get through it.
932285	935529	and you gotta love the line where the guy goes, I gotta take a wicked dump.
936790	937351	That's awesome.
937911	938772	I love Sleepless Camp.
938812	939994	That's an ultimate bad movie.
940014	943277	Then we watched this other movie which, what was it?
943317	947482	It was like something ninjas or like... We watched it fast forward.
947562	948463	Karate Kids.
948723	950986	Karate Kids USA I think is what it was called.
951826	952826	Oh my god, it was horrible.
953346	958507	We fast forwarded through most of that, but there was a part where the kid called this black biker a souffle.
958768	961768	Which I don't know how that's an insult, but whatever.
961808	963669	And he's all, no one calls me a souffle.
963869	964909	I'll see you later.
965409	966229	Like, what?
966249	971010	And they basically have a battle of hillbillies in the forest or something.
971030	972991	Alright, so tell us about the Rue McClanahan movie.
973011	976151	So the Rue McClanahan movie, that was Hollywood After Dark.
976211	979072	By the way, she was Blanche on the Golden Girls, just in case you didn't know.
979957	981118	It was Hollywood After Dark.
981158	986983	It's actually, the film was a part of this, what do they call it, the film crew.
987183	995929	It's the guys that did Mystery Science Theater 3000, but now it's essentially the same damn thing, which is without the robots, and now they can swear and stuff during that.
996590	997230	It was pretty funny.
997630	1002414	But she was playing the stripper, and they made her strip, and it was...
1002967	1004728	Some of the comments they made were really funny.
1006069	1008791	And then there was these weird chicks that they had stripping.
1008871	1010632	There was no nudity in this movie whatsoever.
1010652	1012754	It was made in the 60s, so it was still taboo.
1012774	1014115	Pasties was as far as it went.
1014695	1018978	But they had some really ugly people just stripping, I guess.
1019178	1019899	Thanks for watching!
1035157	1036137	Anyhow, funny stuff.
1036777	1041118	I was thinking we should do a Justin TV thing where we make fun of movies or something.
1041138	1042078	That'd be great.
1042119	1043099	Jamie would love that, too.
1043139	1043959	She loves bad movies.
1043979	1050920	You can go to the Film Cruise website, and they have podcasts that are meant for different movies, and you can play them at the same time as you're watching the movie.
1050960	1051080	Nice.
1051120	1051881	Like newer movies?
1051921	1052721	Newer movies, yeah.
1052741	1053101	Nice.
1053181	1057882	And so, I mean, I highly, after watching this, because this seriously was, it's...
1058762	1076032	I mean, absolutely, without a doubt, I mean, just nothing cut down whatsoever, no watered down, in fact, it was a little bit better, I think, because they were able to, you know, say stuff like, you know, make penis jokes and stuff like that, but absolutely awesome, check out the website, so.
1076252	1077393	Alright, we got on a tangent.
1077673	1081156	My FU of the week goes to the fact that, well, this is actually a good thing.
1081196	1085619	It's been one month since I've been out of the hospital, as of today, for, you know, when I was in there for pancreatitis.
1086179	1088461	But the FU goes to the fact that I'm not sure it's completely gone.
1088661	1091083	Like, I still get chest pains once in a while, and that's kind of irritating.
1091423	1092364	But I found out on Friday.
1092885	1093225	We'll see.
1093445	1094286	FU to blood tests.
1094606	1102832	Especially when the nurse gives you this really horrible tape that, I swear to God, I've tried to wash this off like five times this week, and the residue from the tape is still not coming off.
1102972	1103795	Thank you for watching!
1110956	1113177	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
1113637	1114998	Talk about Fatal Inertia.
1115138	1118460	Fatal Inertia, this is the interesting thing about it.
1119220	1122682	It was going to be coming out as a PlayStation 3 launch title.
1123102	1126444	Then apparently it was going to be on the Xbox 360.
1126904	1129385	Now it's back on the PlayStation Network.
1129865	1131026	It came out for the 360.
1131546	1131846	Did it?
1132006	1134087	Yeah, it did like last September, I think.
1134208	1135048	As an arcade title?
1135268	1137890	And now they're supposed to be making it better, so...
1160043	1160443	Interesting.
1160483	1165124	Well, the EX, Facial Inertia EX is coming out to the PlayStation Network.
1165144	1168705	See, that's what confuses me because it was coming on PSN, whereas the other one was on 360.
1168925	1170725	So I thought it was an arcade title.
1171125	1171865	All right, I get it now.
1172306	1175906	Well, I guess not a lot of people got it on the 360 because I didn't even know about it.
1176166	1176726	But here's the thing.
1176766	1182488	They're going to be adding to it a brand new training mode, more tracks in the game, and apparently the game is not as difficult.
1182668	1184308	They've actually lowered the difficulty a little bit.
1184448	1185411	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1193459	1195460	$29.99 late May is when this game is coming out.
1195480	1197762	Yeah, that's about the price I think the other one was too.
1198122	1200124	I think it was $39.99 when it came out.
1201125	1202646	Awesome.
1203106	1208110	So Mega Man has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records Gamer Edition.
1208350	1210792	I actually had a chance to check this out at a bookstore the other day.
1212093	1213914	I thought it was pretty well put together.
1214535	1219398	But I still laugh at the fact that there's gaming world records in there and they're kind of retarded.
1219498	1219639	But
1220779	1230383	But apparently there are 46 Mega Man games in existence, making it the largest franchise out there.
1230764	1243489	There are 17 games in the Classic Series, 11 Mega Man X games, 4 Mega Man Zero games, 2 Mega Man ZX games, 3 Mega Man Legend games, 6 Mega Man Battle Network games, and 3 Mega Man Star Force games.
1244109	1247491	And I know there's a lot more coming out as well.
1248752	1249513	Hmm.
1251114	1251354	Hmm.
1252194	1253115	Lots of Mega Man.
1253135	1254336	You know, I was tempted, though.
1254376	1257898	The other day I saw the Mega Man Collection, which was a game I think I rented once.
1258218	1261160	And it's great because, you know, the old school Mega Man games are awesome.
1261200	1262601	And, you know, they have the new one that came out.
1262921	1265343	Well, it's not that new now, but it came out on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.
1265683	1267504	Well, you can play old GameCube games on your Wii.
1267904	1274348	And, you know, that Blockbuster we went to to get Sleepaway Camp the other day had the Mega Man Collection for sale for GameCube, a previously played copy.
1274388	1274909	Fifteen bucks.
1275885	1276665	I almost bought it.
1276905	1282486	I'm thinking, like, why not buy that and then, you know, because it's going to come out on Virtual Console eventually.
1282626	1284327	That was 1999 when it first came out, so.
1284607	1285447	Yeah, but still.
1287187	1287788	15's not bad.
1288028	1288428	It's cheap.
1289128	1291048	It's like six, seven Mega Man games.
1291328	1291868	Eight, maybe.
1291908	1293129	I don't remember how many were in there, but a lot.
1293149	1295789	Only three of them are really even worth playing anyway.
1295869	1296209	That's true.
1296229	1299150	That was the first three that were ever created, so.
1299190	1301470	HitStun says, don't get the GameCube one.
1301550	1301930	Why not?
1301970	1304311	I thought the GameCube one had the remixed music, which was cool.
1305591	1313173	I want to say that each version had, like, there was a PlayStation 2 and then there was a GameCube one, and I think each one had, like, a different unlockable game in there or something.
1315494	1316394	Alright, well, whatever.
1316534	1321775	I'm probably not actually going to get the game anyway, because, you know, Irene's going to call me this week, and she's going to be like, dude, Rob, Karazhan.
1321915	1323876	And I'm going to be like, oh, fuck Mega Man.
1324476	1327136	Alright, let's read some mail. ...
1333803	1334504	and DarkSakura.com.
1357779	1361061	Really quickly, ShadowCharlie sent us an email about this whole article.
1361481	1366564	He basically copy-pasted an article about the Mothers Against Drunk Driving attacking Grand Theft Auto 4.
1366684	1367124	Retarded.
1367404	1368125	And why is that?
1368185	1369706	Well, let me give you the gist of what happened.
1370006	1376429	Basically, they're pissed because you can actually drive drunk in the game, and I believe it's the objective of one of the missions in the game.
1376749	1379811	They're claiming Grand Theft Auto should be re-rated as adults only.
1380111	1382552	It's not... That's the spin that they're putting on it.
1382652	1385534	There is no... I mean, you can drive drunk in the game, but...
1385754	1386074	DarkSakura.com
1407381	1413285	And you can hail a cab, you know, to take you back home, but... Sensationalism around Grand Theft Auto 4?
1413385	1414266	I know, it's crazy.
1414306	1415566	Oh, surely you jest.
1415967	1419409	Yeah, I know, and people, like, you know, claiming things that aren't actually in the game?
1419469	1420550	Yeah, that's surprising.
1421110	1424532	See, that's so stupid, because you can do other shit in the games.
1424712	1429976	Yeah, murder okay, drunk driving, whoa, that's taking it too far.
1429996	1431757	Excuse me, sir, you gotta change your rating.
1431857	1435860	Frisbee in chat is screaming, it's not real driving, it's not real drunk.
1437770	1439211	It is pretty cool the way it's done, though.
1439572	1443916	The whole camera shakes around and stuff, and randomly your car will swerve in different directions.
1443936	1447779	You have to kind of counter-steer for that, but I like it.
1447799	1448440	I think it's pretty cool.
1449501	1453765	You know, you can ride animals while drunk in World of Warcraft, and no one says anything about that.
1453845	1454545	That's true.
1454665	1457028	No one said anything about Saints Row.
1457068	1459750	You could get high and stoned and stuff in that game.
1459790	1462152	You can also get drunk and drive around and kill people.
1463106	1469334	In fact, they kind of insist that when you are drunk, you have superpowers and can punch people really far away.
1469875	1470676	So I don't know.
1470696	1471998	I don't know.
1472338	1472759	Interesting.
1473600	1473981	All right.
1474361	1476564	Moving on to the next email from GS68.
1478106	1483291	HeyOLRCrew, specifically Loki and RobRobRob, I have a bad feeling about your appearance at Fonamay.
1483311	1487735	You're not listed under the panel section of the Fonamay 2008 site at Fonamay.com.
1488035	1490057	Are you going to try and make a last-minute arrangement or something?
1490097	1496322	If there's no OLR panel this year, then I suppose us Bay Area OLR fans will just have to find some other way to meet up at Fonamay.
1496703	1501027	This email brought to you by Hooters, home of the never-ending girls' butts.
1502187	1503708	God, that Olive Garden thing is caught on.
1503748	1505629	Everybody's signing their emails with strange things now.
1505649	1507949	Yeah, we're going to have to break the news to you.
1507989	1509330	We are not attending Fanime this year.
1509370	1510930	We do not plan on doing a live panel this year.
1510991	1512291	It is nothing against Fanime.
1512331	1514052	We still love the staff and everything.
1514612	1517113	The thing is that Jamie has other plans this year.
1517253	1519774	And quite frankly, it's a three-day weekend.
1519794	1522675	It's one of the few that us working kids have during the year.
1523055	1525556	And so we just want to take the weekend to kind of do other things.
1526096	1532419	and also since we're going to be hopefully doing PAX and some other shows later in the year, we've just decided to sit this one out.
1532659	1533379	Sorry.
1534519	1536140	Is anybody going to Fanime just for fun?
1536160	1537520	Out of curiosity?
1538401	1539741	No.
1539781	1542582	This is the first year you haven't been to Fanime in a long time, isn't it?
1543043	1543543	No, it hasn't.
1543683	1544803	I thought you went like every year.
1545063	1546984	I used to like when I was in the anime.
1547724	1550045	What, like five years ago?
1552246	1554487	And even then, it was only really like three years in a row.
1556488	1561232	Well, still, those of you guys that are going to Fanime, we hope you have a lot, a lot of fun, and good luck.
1561992	1565155	ASEN is being yelled in chat, and ASEN is too soon.
1565235	1566136	ASEN is very soon.
1566876	1576083	The problem is, I was originally wanting to go to ASEN, but my medical things came up, and I had to put it aside, because that kind of stuff is more important for me right now.
1576183	1576944	Maybe next year.
1577124	1577965	I'm really hoping.
1578285	1583349	PAX is the most definite right now, and you never know what else might happen in the future.
1583489	1584490	If you have a con...
1585070	1591452	that's drivable, or let's say in California or like Reno or even Oregon, hell, let us know.
1591492	1593112	We'll try to come if you'd like to have us there.
1593832	1597053	Otherwise, if it's something we've got to fly to, it just depends on the budget.
1597193	1603535	And by budget, I mean how much money we have in our pockets because we don't, you notice we don't run ads on this show, meaning we have no money.
1604750	1607652	Mark from Plymouth, England sends us the next email.
1607712	1610714	It's a bit long, so I'm just going to read some of this here.
1611695	1616378	He says, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, although the track of this message may lead you to at first think that I might be.
1617298	1620080	I want to start by saying that here in the UK, there's no real Nintendo history.
1620140	1631027	As back as in the 80s, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum ruled the gaming of everyone, and Nintendo was almost unknown to me and my friends until I was too old and busy with serious dating to get back into it.
1631327	1633829	Here, the NES and SNES were pretty much unknown things.
1634369	1642392	Now my main point, Wii isn't increasing the gamer base as mentioned by you on episode 277, and often it's a war cry by many of the too many podcasts I listen to.
1642752	1645433	I know you don't hate the Wii and are open about its strengths and weaknesses.
1645813	1652555	However, I believe, not as my personal experience, that as I am a gamer, definitely not hardcore, although I'm very much into all the latest news.
1652655	1655816	I am presently most all about handhelds due to access issues to the big ass TV.
1656656	1661079	My Wii is also freely played by my wife, who would categorize herself as a non-gamer, and her family.
1661460	1668365	In fact, my next night shift has been scheduled for a Wii Fit Night, in which my wife has invited her friends and sisters for drinks and laughs on the board.
1668685	1674429	This type of sociability has led all the family to buying Wiis, and they are now the prime console.
1674449	1682996	The collateral fallout is that many others in the household now play, whereas before, one person, maybe two, per household, played the kids and parents are buying games for the Wii.
1684266	1687809	Is there any figures on players per console for old and present gen?
1688149	1689850	I'd like to bet the figure has risen.
1690130	1691031	Is there anything like that?
1691331	1691791	I doubt it.
1692932	1694073	I don't know.
1694894	1700237	I'm going to kind of cut some of this email out, but he was just sort of making the point that the Wii is definitely kind of caught on in that way.
1700998	1702799	But what about the software?
1702819	1704861	He talks about why do some shovelware games sell well?
1705261	1710585	Is that the taste of light gamers are different in a lot of early games to the Wii or games ported over from PS2 games?
1710825	1712486	It's because people don't know any better.
1712747	1721954	The moms and pops that are going to stores that are buying their kids' games, they look at it, they're like, okay, well, they can get Mario Kart and they can get this other game that looks very similar.
1722414	1725737	And all they have to go by is the pictures on the back and stuff and the price point.
1725757	1731982	And they're like, well, it's $20 cheaper or $30 cheaper, so hey, let's go ahead and give it a shot.
1732363	1734064	And unfortunately, it's just like movies.
1734104	1737647	You may go to your rental store or whatever and
1738015	1744547	You're looking at the back of the movie and all you have to go by is the cover and what it says on the back and you can bring it home and it's complete shit.
1748177	1751740	I still haven't dipped my toes into the HD gaming experience.
1751780	1757085	I like the PS3, but I'm not sure due to price and limited titles, although a good 6 would do for me for now.
1757145	1759267	I hate Metal Gear Solid as it just doesn't float my boat.
1759307	1760368	Personally, I hate cutscenes.
1760749	1765874	The Xbox 360 has a catalog, but I get burned on the original Xbox when shortly after buying one, they went and retired it for the 360.
1766975	1768396	Also, my brother has gone through four 360s.
1769597	1770878	So is now a good time to buy a 360?
1771599	1773260	Have the issues of Red Ring of Death been cured?
1773300	1776983	Or should I wait a little longer as the trading games pile is getting bigger every day?
1777363	1779464	Is a smaller, cooler 360 on the horizon?
1779785	1786410	I know it's an old question from last year and before, but now that 360 is maturing, has it lost its legs and arthritis is setting in?
1786450	1787791	Or is now the time to jump in?
1788291	1790633	An arcade is cheaper than the Wii right now.
1790673	1792174	I have no intention of going online.
1792494	1794896	Is a hard drive necessary for the download content?
1795356	1797538	Or do I have to accept that patches are the way of the future?
1799321	1803843	I would say that it's probably fine to buy it now.
1803903	1808025	I think 360's probably going to be at its peak for the next couple years.
1808445	1815289	You're right, the system's matured, but that's when all the really good games start coming out over the next couple years, and then we'll start getting into a new cycle of systems.
1815569	1821772	As far as hardware problems go, the new 360's that they have out now aren't really as prone to the hardware problems as
1822503	1823244	Thanks for watching!
1837577	1843219	Here's what you've got to watch out for, is that maybe a new 360 is going to come out.
1843259	1846541	This is really inevitable with every console, but there were some strong rumors this week.
1846561	1847981	I don't think I'm spoiling anything on show roll.
1848222	1854784	There were some very strong rumors this week about the Blu-ray, and I guess actually a press release was put out, so it might be more than rumor.
1856245	1859827	The Xbox 360 is actually going to be getting a Blu-ray in it.
1860827	1862728	Somebody's been contracted to actually put...
1863628	1866810	Put that technology together where the Blu-ray Xbox 360 is going to be coming out.
1866830	1868752	Because HD DVD is officially dead.
1869532	1873595	Microsoft has left them no choice but to get on the Blu-ray board if they want their system to play movies as well.
1873615	1874556	They're not DVD.
1874716	1875276	HD movies.
1875716	1878458	So you've got to be careful because you never know what's going to happen.
1878478	1880660	The day after you buy your system, this might come out.
1880680	1881820	But that's just a chance you take.
1883902	1884782	It happens with anything.
1885603	1887104	Ask anyone who owns an Apple product.
1888345	1891387	You buy an iPhone and then a few months later, SUPER IPHONE!
1893137	1895298	Watch, there will be a super iPhone this year, just so you know.
1898419	1901620	Ross Steel UT wrote us and wanted to get in a few words about this.
1901940	1904522	I want to get in a few words on the idea of gays in gaming.
1904582	1907743	Sexuality isn't anywhere near as taboo as it was five or so years ago.
1907843	1911544	Now it seems that every other game is so chock full of cock teasing that it borders on the tasteless.
1911944	1918147	Dead or Alive is built entirely upon sexual exploitation and the guy game was only pulled off the shelves because it featured an underage girl going topless.
1918527	1926551	The reason we don't see gay characters in games or even a very deep exploration of sexuality besides making women as slutty as possible has nothing to do with the rating systems out there.
1926871	1929053	Conan and God of War had frontal nudity, as you know.
1929333	1932134	The problem here is the striking lack of diversity in the gaming industry.
1932434	1937177	While game players come from all faiths, colors, creeds, and orientations, game developers do not.
1937677	1938177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1961304	1966432	Well, if you want to get other audiences into gaming, maybe you ought to start putting that kind of stuff into games.
1966532	1970899	Well, I think they also run the problem with the ESRB.
1971019	1975286	They rate that kind of crap more offensive than female nudity.
1977162	1980743	Alright, well, Rostu goes on Of course, I can't talk about this without mentioning the audience.
1981063	1985945	Go to any internet gaming forum before that matter, Xbox Live, and you'll find rampant sexism and homophobia.
1986385	1990367	One need only look at what happened to Jade Raymond, leaning up to the launch of Assassin's Creed.
1990667	1998050	For months last year, sites like Kotaku and Joystick were more concerned with making creepy blogs about how nice she looked and smelled than covering the goddamn game.
1998470	2006373	The idiocy climaxed in a horrific comic depicting Jade, a well-educated, experienced professional game developer, as a brainless bimbo who can't even pronounce creative
2006673	2007233	Thank you for watching!
2022884	2029387	Thus, we get more objectified women and the role of gay characters is limited to the joke character like Makoto from Enchanted Arms.
2029728	2036451	With time, as gaming businesses learn the importance of demographics and stop belittling people who aren't straight, white men, this will pass.
2036811	2037752	We just need to hang on.
2038672	2041954	This message brought to you by Pizza Hut, makers of the pure grease pizza.
2044778	2045098	I don't know.
2045978	2046859	What do you think, Irene?
2046899	2050420	You're a woman, an OMG girl that plays video games.
2050580	2062103	Do you think that games aren't coming out geared more towards women because... See, there's a stereotype that women love playing puzzle games.
2062823	2068885	I don't think it's so much that as it is puzzle games don't have overly sexualized women in the games.
2068945	2070425	Says the woman that plays Puzzle Pirates.
2071443	2084800	No, yeah, I mean, that's part of the reason, because I don't have to think about, like, okay, I'm going to see some, you know, slutty thing, some woman, like, you know, sluttified in this game or whatever, but... Although, that sounds like a good idea for a puzzle game.
2086397	2089120	Puzzle Sluts How would Puzzle Sluts work?
2104292	2112056	Well, they have, like... But they need to have... Okay, there needs to be, like, a code that you put in, like, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and you get male puzzle sluts.
2112376	2114317	Because we need something for everybody in this game.
2114337	2116458	Okay, I think I could see how this might work.
2116718	2117578	All right.
2118378	2124501	You would have in each, like... So let's go the route of, like, say, Puzzle Fighter, okay?
2124641	2124901	All right.
2125222	2128783	So you would have inside each one of the gems, like, a different woman.
2128843	2132185	And when you break the gem, they would follow the bottom of the screen and, you know...
2132865	2146103	more gems next to each other and they just start kind of going at it in the bottom of the screen until you get this big orgy that pile up in the bottom I like it brilliant brilliant patent pending
2147466	2148107	Nobody steal it.
2149909	2150689	I don't know.
2150909	2151870	Here's a good example.
2152371	2153251	Heavenly Sword.
2153772	2158656	You know how the main character is this hot chick that kicks ass and all that stuff?
2159256	2162960	I was kind of detracted from it because it was just like, come on.
2163000	2165161	That's totally not realistic.
2165442	2170226	If she were just a normal girl, I probably would have been more inclined to play it.
2170286	2174770	Been more focused on actual gameplay than like, oogling over her or whatever.
2174850	2175050	But
2176445	2176685	I don't know.
2176705	2187773	I think that something like putting gay characters or sensible women in games is something that's going to have to be left up to independent game producers.
2187793	2199381	Well, like, for example, Saints Row 2 that's coming out, you can be a male and or female character, or you can be a transsexual in the game and run around, and you can totally customize your characters and stuff.
2199401	2199501	Yeah.
2199963	2204216	But you know people that are going to be playing Saints Row aren't going to be playing them like seriously.
2204236	2206041	They're going to be playing them to mock them, so...
2206690	2207651	I gotta show you this, though.
2207711	2209473	Now, does this pique your interest, Irene?
2209493	2218521	Because this story came up earlier this week, and I don't think it's on our show world tonight, but Lost Planet Colonies is going to be, I guess they're getting a new version of it coming out.
2218921	2220262	I guess it's some type of expansion.
2220342	2227008	One of the characters in it is the Dead Rising star, you know, Frank West, but he doesn't have clothes on.
2227068	2231012	He's just wearing a skimpy little pair of blue and yellow boxer briefs.
2231032	2231813	That's all he's wearing.
2232950	2235672	Now, is that maybe the contrast to your heavenly sword?
2235712	2238674	Would you maybe be interested in checking out Lost Planet Colonies?
2238754	2241616	Because, hello, good-looking man running around in his skimpy undies.
2242277	2243237	See, that's debatable.
2243278	2244398	I don't think he looks good.
2244638	2248221	And he's kind of retarded to be running around on this frozen wasteland.
2248261	2249002	Yeah, it's kind of weird.
2249042	2250563	He's like, I'm fine.
2250783	2251944	Well, that won't do at all.
2252423	2257887	Yeah, I guess sex does sell, but do they really need to sexualize people?
2257947	2258948	I mean, there are plenty of good games.
2258968	2259989	Actdeft, by the way, is clearing up.
2260029	2261630	It's like the greatest hits version of the game.
2261650	2263231	Yeah, they added more crap to it.
2263491	2264912	See, I don't follow Lost Planet.
2264932	2265373	Sorry, guys.
2266093	2269716	Remember when games, you didn't even have to care about their sexuality?
2269836	2273339	Mario walking around in overalls and shit.
2273599	2276681	Well, but as I think stories become more... I mean, let's face it.
2276781	2279323	Video games today are practically big-budget movies.
2279483	2280424	Big, big-budget movies.
2280924	2281344	And, you know...
2283067	2285850	I'd kind of like to see that sort of representation in movies as well.
2285950	2288492	And it took a while for movies to get there, but it got there.
2288613	2290915	Okay, tell me which Yuna you like better.
2291075	2294418	Do you like Yuna from Final Fantasy X, or do you like her better in X-2?
2296673	2300315	Final Fantasy X is today I'm listening to Depeche Mode because I'm emo.
2319394	2322637	I guess it also depends on what kind of mood you're in.
2322677	2329503	If you just want to play, like your motivation behind playing the game, but if it's strictly to like get off, it's just silly.
2329603	2332805	It's like, come on, is that what you're going to base your game on?
2332905	2335608	Some kind of like sexy character or something?
2335648	2337349	You can't do more with what you have?
2337409	2338290	You can't be creative?
2338900	2339200	All right.
2339220	2343044	Well, let's do some more emails here because I want to get through the rest of these emails tonight.
2343585	2345227	Ben from Tokyo has emailed us.
2345267	2346208	Wanted to clear some things up.
2346228	2347209	We were talking about Singapore.
2347229	2356338	Speaking of the gays gaming thing, we talked last week about how in Singapore they're adding homosexuality to what is instantly making a game adults only overseas.
2356698	2360943	And that was Mass Effect was impacted by that because there was OMG lesbians for like five seconds in the game.
2361923	2365704	So Ben wrote us, says, love the show, want to keep it short as I have to rant about some stuff.
2365724	2366144	Singapore.
2366504	2368985	In Singapore, it is basically illegal to be gay.
2369345	2371165	Illegal as in you go to jail.
2371586	2374486	More precise would be to say that anything openly gay is banned.
2374546	2378107	Gays are not employed by public offices, not allowed to live in certain areas.
2378167	2380228	That part also holds for certain foreigners.
2380528	2381848	And homosexual acts are illegal.
2381928	2385689	So complaining about the rating system is like accusing a serial killer of fashion crimes.
2386289	2389630	By the way, it is only the American rating system that is crazy about sexual topics.
2390890	2392031	It's so disheartening to read.
2392311	2401956	You do have to remember that we are kind of lucky sometimes to live in a nation that at least we don't get arrested for it, even though there's still a lot of progress to make.
2402216	2408839	You look at countries like Canada and Spain and wherever where gays can get married and it's just whatever.
2408919	2413541	No one cares because it's not like, OMG, they're going to come into my house and redecorate things.
2413561	2414001	Watch out.
2415402	2418304	It's, you know, it just, whatever, you know?
2418764	2420124	People are so much more laid back.
2420665	2425627	But then sometimes you have to come to that harsh reality where like, wow, you know, America's way ahead of some other people.
2426267	2426908	Kind of just sad.
2427788	2428208	Just sad.
2428949	2433191	Yeah, but even California is kind of more the exception anyway.
2433331	2439194	I mean, if you go to any other place in the U.S., you probably, they probably won't be as accepting.
2439354	2439894	Yeah.
2440234	2440754	It depends.
2441074	2441775	It just depends.
2442315	2458003	Like I was saying last week, I think we're getting to a point, I think we're very lucky, where most 20-somethings and most younger 30-somethings and most teenagers even, I think teenagers even more so, everybody knows someone who's gay and more and more people just have the attitude of whatever.
2458143	2459244	It's no big deal.
2459304	2460264	It's just whatever.
2460764	2465107	They realize it doesn't mean they're suddenly going to fuck me in the ass when I'm not looking.
2467119	2471602	I think people are over that real kind of childish mentality about it, you know what I mean?
2471622	2474423	Yeah, it's like, is that what they're really afraid of?
2474563	2476804	Like, oh my god, he's gonna come fuck me in the ass.
2476904	2477365	I don't know.
2478225	2478866	I have no idea.
2480366	2481967	I'm left to assume.
2482147	2482728	It's funny.
2483028	2483448	I don't know.
2484229	2484589	It is stupid.
2486026	2486586	Copyright.
2486626	2488187	Ben wanted to say something about copyright too.
2488487	2495731	While you just mentioned it briefly, I have to say that downloading fan subs and any other copyrighted material is of course illegal, even if there is no licensing in your country.
2496031	2498332	Without licensing, there is just nobody to complain about it.
2498452	2499272	That doesn't make it legal.
2499592	2501934	Thus, fan subs are in a somewhat gray area.
2502354	2508236	Note that this only holds if your country has a copyright law, which, for example, Thailand at least didn't have for a long time.
2508937	2512959	So that kind of came up on last week's show about the whole copyright thing went back and forth.
2512979	2513199	Yeah.
2514019	2514820	There you have it.
2515720	2516301	More emails.
2517201	2519103	I know there's a lot tonight, but actually these are pretty good.
2520644	2522305	Ranma emailed us, very happy.
2522345	2526968	There was a mention of Video Power on last week's show and was kind of running down Video Power a little bit.
2527609	2529130	The first season had Johnny Arcade.
2529150	2534434	He would come into the room, talk about games for five minutes that he's going to review, and then there was a 20-minute cartoon.
2534694	2536355	But the second season was a game show.
2536675	2539637	Four people would get a chance to ask Johnny a question to compete on the show.
2539998	2541759	First round was getting the highest score in a game.
2541819	2543000	Second round was trivia questions.
2543320	2549865	After that was the round where you ran through the game area and you could get, you know, Jansport bags, Genesis, and Neo Geo console.
2550825	2554288	I pretty much think that Acclaim did a majority of the sponsorship of the show, but I could be wrong.
2554688	2555609	Well, that's it for now.
2556009	2559372	Keep up the good work and y'all in two months for OLRCon 2008.
2559872	2560632	There's an OLRCon 2008?
2560673	2561053	Yeah.
2561073	2564495	What the hell have I been?
2565236	2565676	I don't know.
2565716	2566597	Where have you been?
2567629	2572134	I heard something was going down over Fourth of July, but I didn't know we were actually having a little convention.
2572734	2573335	What the crap?
2573395	2574716	Am I always the last one to hear about this?
2574976	2575477	Hear about what?
2576358	2578360	I guess there's no Alarcon happening.
2578440	2579441	I think it's Fourth of July.
2580939	2581199	I know.
2581959	2583320	Ranma, you need to email me and tell me.
2583400	2584660	I've not been told about this.
2584940	2587221	Nor have I. Or I forgot.
2587261	2587721	You know what?
2587961	2588401	I'm human.
2588521	2589341	I might have forgot.
2589841	2590321	I'll go.
2591242	2593502	I mean, obviously, if it's all our con, I guess I'll go.
2593782	2594182	Yeah.
2594662	2596743	But I'm just kind of curious what's going on.
2596783	2599504	Well, let's advertise it on the show if something's going on.
2601584	2607046	And lastly, Ranma closes with, this email was brought to you by Joey Paisanos of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.
2607406	2608306	You'll love Paisanos.
2610905	2611405	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2634785	2639569	I think RustyLUT was completely off the mark last week with his rants over reviews, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts.
2639909	2642811	If a game is bad, such as Lair, then the review scores will reflect it.
2643091	2647295	If the game is good, such as Grand Theft Auto 4, then the review scores will reflect that as well.
2647355	2647655	Thoughts?
2647735	2648456	Keep up the good work.
2649474	2649954	Here it is.
2650515	2654897	I never said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was probably not going to get 10s out of 10s from everywhere.
2655297	2657578	And it's probably pretty deserving of those 10s out of 10s.
2657758	2662160	I'm just saying that kind of policy about, you know, sure we'll accept the exclusive.
2662180	2662561	What was it?
2662601	2668263	I think they came out and admitted that they had traded for advertising on the site to get the exclusive review.
2668824	2673886	I mean, that kind of sets a bad precedent because, yes, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a good, good game, I don't know.
2673946	2675027	What about games in the future?
2675799	2680165	Yeah, because they said, oh yeah, this didn't affect our review score.
2680665	2684270	Let's not forget about what went down at GameSpot and Kane and Lynch.
2684370	2684671	Hello.
2685390	2696637	Well, let's not forget what happened to GameSpot and Grand Theft Auto 4, where there was a review that leaked out that gave it a 9.5, and then that was retracted, and there was a 10.0 review put out.
2697457	2698878	Who's to say that they weren't going to do that?
2699098	2706823	And apparently there was a process where they rate it, and then they do a peer review process, and then they re-rate it or some shit like that.
2707523	2708164	I don't know, it's just...
2709406	2721694	It's fishy, and not to say that this game wouldn't have gotten high marks anyways, but it's still fishy, and it's not a really good situation to be in, especially after the whole Kane and Lynch thing.
2722575	2724296	Honestly, do people really give a shit?
2724756	2727278	Oh, we rated it 9.5, but really it's a 10.
2727718	2728339	We were off by .5.
2729019	2731101	It's like, okay, it's a good game.
2731181	2733302	We get what you're conveying with your ranking.
2733322	2736724	It's just more crap that they can throw up in their advertising campaigns for it.
2736884	2737805	It's been rated a 10 by IGN.
2739526	2740307	10 out of 10.
2740708	2743872	They can throw that in their commercials and advertise that shit.
2744493	2747637	It's just more points for them, I guess.
2751147	2751507	All right.
2751908	2755150	Well, there's our thoughts on that, and that's going to do it for the mailbag.
2755190	2757611	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
2757631	2767717	I'm going to tell you guys for future weeks, honestly, the more condensed you can make your emails, the better, because our mailbag segment has been going kind of long lately, so we're going to have to start getting choosier.
2767777	2774341	So we do try to condense down big emails, but if you can do that, it makes it all the better.
2774541	2775302	So just so you know.
2775962	2779364	If you want to go off for a longer period of time, there is always a Skype line.
2779384	2781785	If you listen to us live Sunday nights on allgames.com.
2782365	2783606	Let's get back into the gaming news.
2785066	2785327	Loki.
2789190	2794973	There's a new card game coming out, not Eye of Judgment, but it's being released by EA.
2795233	2798874	It's called Battleforge, the collectible trading card game.
2798914	2806618	It's coming up this fall and doesn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but they're comparing it to, of course, Magic the Gathering.
2807298	2813561	It's a fantasy online real-time strategy game with collectible trading cards.
2814221	2814481	One to one.
2838479	2844081	Because, you know, developers these days love these things where they can just charge extra money for the expansions and all that stuff, huh?
2844101	2844441	Exactly.
2844801	2846182	You know, it's a collectible card game.
2846202	2852264	What they're trying to do is they're trying to make a game that captures, you know, the fans of, like, Magic the Gathering.
2852324	2862007	It's going to be at, you know, the same level as Magic the Gathering and get people, you know, buying these card decks and stuff like that as much as possible.
2862547	2862687	So...
2864794	2865155	I don't know.
2865797	2869429	I guess it's a good idea strategy wise, but will people fall for it?
2869489	2869750	I don't know.
2870856	2873738	All right, well, R-Type Command is coming out on May 6th.
2873778	2874799	That's coming out on the PSP.
2874839	2877761	It's R-Type the strategy game, which ought to be interesting.
2878121	2895233	But what's kind of cool about this is that Atlus has actually announced that they are going to be putting out, just for a limited time, and just for those that buy the game from either GameStop, Amazon, GameCrazy, EB Games Canada, and some other specific retailers, they get to get a little free plastic miniature replica of the R9 spacecraft.
2895433	2895893	TechMobile Kickoff
2919082	2920722	will be landing on the DS.
2922043	2925943	They haven't really said too many details on it yet, but here's what we do know.
2925983	2928884	There's going to be a variety of teams with 32 to choose from.
2929624	2948147	There will be all new cutscenes showing off dramatic presentations of various plays, a customizable playbook, stylus control, of course it's going to have Wi-Fi and wireless multiplayer, customizable teams, and it's based on, of course, Tecmo Super Bowl.
2952198	2952658	Very nice.
2954079	2958721	By the way, tonight we were going to be doing the match game, but unfortunately we didn't get around to it.
2959642	2965985	Our resources were a little limited this week, so just a reminder, because this is the point where we were supposed to do match game, but we're tabling it to next week.
2966065	2967226	Sorry, kids.
2967526	2968606	Our contestants are already picked.
2968666	2971628	It's the Toshin and Footy showdown for the ResCode.
2972048	2973949	And if one of them's not here, then we'll get somebody else.
2975213	2975954	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3001133	3004555	Also, South Korea, a 5.1% price drop.
3005175	3007976	And Taiwan, a 17% price drop.
3008757	3011938	So, it's very interesting.
3011998	3014780	And I guess those price drops have already happened.
3014840	3017261	They happened earlier last week.
3019465	3020765	Hooray for price drops.
3020785	3022086	That makes some people very happy.
3022546	3024887	Hey, kids, we're going to be opening up the Skype line very soon.
3024927	3027608	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3027688	3029829	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3029849	3032490	But first, we have a couple more quick stories for you guys.
3032970	3037152	One of them is the Famicom Mobile, or I'm sorry, the FC Mobile.
3037232	3040633	I probably should say it the other way because, you know, that would be a complete ripoff of the name.
3040973	3042574	But I guess, I mean, it seems like the...
3044094	3048918	Patent on Nintendo's thing has expired or something because all these Nintendo knockoffs have been coming out lately.
3049319	3057826	And now one of them is a mobile system that will actually, not mobile phones, but a mobile system that will actually play Nintendo games on the go.
3057906	3060068	It can actually take the old Nintendo cartridges.
3060808	3063210	It has a 2.4 inch color LCD screen.
3063250	3064731	It runs on three AA batteries.
3065072	3067294	It's got speakers, a place to plug in headphones.
3067634	3070977	You can plug the unit into the TV and play the NES games on the TV.
3072298	3076320	and it's being sold I guess overseas but it only plays American NES games.
3076620	3078682	You can find them on eBay for $40 to $50.
3080803	3088348	And that's because the patent expired for the original NES which makes me think in a couple of years the patent's going to expire on the Super Nintendo, right?
3089509	3091870	We're going to start seeing more and more of these as years go on.
3091910	3097214	Pretty soon every CD player will have a PlayStation 1 in it when that patent expires.
3097254	3098075	That's going to be interesting.
3099676	3099996	We'll see.
3101213	3104375	Unless they renew the patent, in which case, then, uh-oh.
3105836	3107097	Now, this is interesting.
3108097	3110338	This is almost like seeing a unicorn, I guess.
3110499	3117523	But apparently, Shack News website has actually seen Duke Nukem Forever, the game, in reality.
3117543	3118043	What?
3118503	3120744	They've actually seen the real game being played.
3121405	3126588	And apparently, I guess, Shack News is very close to 3D Realms offices.
3127328	3127448	And...
3128949	3146566	They were shown about half an hour of footage from the game, I guess gameplay, including some environmental puzzles, interactivity, a host of finished weapons, an existence of an in-game forklift, and plenty of heads and arms.
3146626	3148048	Oh my god, a forklift?
3148308	3148708	Yes.
3148849	3149589	What the fork?
3150650	3151191	Yeah.
3152932	3163674	Let's see, it says, apparently 3D Realms, George Broussard, the developer, said, out of the blue, I just decided to show them Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour.
3164874	3172275	Well, I would like to see Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour, and I'm sure a lot of other people would too, to at least, I don't know, how about an idea?
3172675	3175696	How about you show the world Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour?
3175756	3177416	How about you show them for like two minutes?
3177516	3177956	Two minutes?
3177996	3178216	Yeah.
3179576	3180677	Is that so much to ask?
3181437	3182417	I mean, seriously.
3184164	3184444	Wow.
3186564	3188225	Do you think it's really, really going to come out?
3188765	3190765	I think it will, but I think it will underwhelm everybody.
3192446	3192866	We'll see.
3192886	3194046	I guess it's kind of like Prey.
3194466	3199427	Even though I enjoyed Prey, it was kind of underwhelming to a lot of people because there was so much that went into it.
3199487	3199967	You know what I mean?
3200007	3201807	Like so much hype and everything that went into it.
3202268	3203948	And then I guess it kind of disappointed.
3204548	3206508	And the thing about Prey, it like ended like that.
3206728	3209109	Like the ending was just like kind of out of the middle of nowhere.
3209129	3209669	It was kind of weird.
3211385	3213927	I hear there's a sequel being planned though, so we'll see what happens with that.
3214507	3216808	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line finally.
3216848	3224413	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
3225253	3231197	You can always find out more about the Skype line and how it works if you go to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
3231237	3234839	That gives you the whole spiel about how the Skype line works.
3234879	3235640	Let's go to the phones.
3236240	3237261	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3237281	3237601	Who's this?
3239275	3243082	I got balls of steel Oh, I'm sorry, you're a little quiet What's that, sir?
3244204	3247290	I got balls of steel You have balls of steel
3249022	3250043	This is DJ Dark Knight.
3250243	3251463	Hey, what's up, DJ Dark Knight?
3251543	3251904	Oh, I see.
3252224	3256086	You're getting a little happy about the news about Duke Nukem Forever.
3257046	3261749	Nah, just basically doing the running gag of jokes everybody else is posting about the balls of steel thing.
3261829	3264890	Whoa, the audio quality on this call is no bueno.
3265611	3266491	Something's going on there.
3266731	3273315	Dark Knight, your call quality is like really staticky and it's probably going to drive our podcast listeners nuts.
3273675	3277197	Hurry up and get, I'm going to give you like 10 seconds to get your question out and then we're going to have to let you go.
3278542	3285706	Okay, um, just basically about the, um, I'm a little bit late to the show because I've basically been testing something else out.
3287167	3296572	Um, mostly about the, um, GTA 4 situation and whatnot and, I mean, how much longer do you think the man is going to be before he finally dies off?
3298210	3300051	How long what is going to be before it dies off?
3300712	3302552	Oh, the demand is going to be before it dies off.
3302572	3304213	All right, we'll answer your question, Dark Knight.
3304253	3304814	Take care, buddy.
3305494	3307675	How long do you think it is going to be before the demand dies off?
3307875	3309496	Well, look at all the other games that have come out.
3309516	3310957	They've been selling well for years.
3311117	3313978	Hell, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas still sells really well.
3316683	3318164	It's going to keep selling through Christmas.
3318204	3318804	Here's why.
3318844	3321145	Because not everybody's up to the HD age.
3321425	3321966	Here's the thing.
3321986	3323746	There's this whole domino effect going on.
3323786	3325867	This is why Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to stay out there.
3325887	3326988	It's because of the domino effect.
3327528	3332770	By February 2009, lots of people are going to have to buy new TVs.
3333010	3335952	Actually, they only have to buy digital converters for their TVs.
3336232	3338233	And keep in mind, this is, I believe, America only.
3338273	3340594	I'm not sure if Canada is affected by this or other countries.
3340914	3343335	But at least in America, they have passed this thing where...
3343735	3347738	all television will be digital signals by February of 2009.
3348298	3350739	So you have to get this digital converter for your television.
3351200	3354422	But what's happening is most people are getting scared, like they don't understand it.
3354702	3357764	So most people are just using it to buy a new TV that has digital in it.
3358064	3363307	And a lot of people, especially when you start talking about tax rebates, the stimulus coming up and everything,
3363527	3364168	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3380646	3400793	I believe the Xbox 360 and Blu-ray thing may be true they're going to want to get that out there by Christmas because they want to get a part of this domino effect because they get the high def TVs then they're going to buy the Blu-ray players and then of course you want to buy games you play on these systems Grand Theft Auto has a lot of name recognition this thing will continue to sell through Christmas for that reason agree?
3402474	3402654	yes
3403447	3404188	Alright, good.
3404368	3405228	You should always agree with me.
3405588	3410992	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3411292	3413614	While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
3413905	3423033	Yes, Resistance Fall of Man 2 is going to be playable at the PlayStation Day, which is coming out on Tuesday, May 6th.
3423553	3428758	So I'm sure we're going to see a lot of press releases coming out of that probably pretty soon.
3429118	3435243	Something else also kind of tying in with PlayStation Day, Motorstorm 2 has had a name change.
3435304	3437726	Now it's being renamed Motorstorm Pacific Rift.
3438723	3442145	So, meaning it's Motor Store 1 re-skimmed.
3442345	3443186	Hi, caller, are you there?
3443266	3443666	Who's this?
3444707	3445748	This is Spazinator.
3446188	3446588	I'm sorry?
3447549	3448249	Spazinator.
3450211	3451772	Spell that for me.
3451812	3454814	Yeah, the screen name I usually go by is Spazinator.
3455854	3456735	All right, what's your question?
3456775	3457435	What's on your mind, buddy?
3458276	3464080	Yeah, I was wondering, now that GTA 4 is out, do you think we're going to be...
3465335	3471487	Hearing from the lawyer that we shall not name, we're going to see where those are.
3472150	3473610	Lawsuits coming out of the woodwork?
3495836	3499919	Pin it on Grand Theft Auto and try to sue the makers and try to get the game pulled from shelves.
3500259	3506163	And heaven forbid if there's any hidden things this time around, although I'm sure Take-Two took extra, extra precaution.
3506203	3511206	And Rockstar, they all took extra, extra precaution to make sure there's nothing hidden on that disc.
3512307	3520313	Yeah, now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there something mentioned maybe a few months ago?
3520333	3525076	Someone here, correct me if I'm wrong, but some kind of
3525672	3531849	Injunction or something on this guy, you know, saying that, you know, he can't sue anyone or...
3533453	3537175	I want to say Take-Two complained about him in the court.
3537836	3542259	Basically, he has to get someone else to sign off on any lawsuit that he does.
3542339	3545481	But no, there is still right now... But only in Florida, right?
3546322	3547503	No, anywhere.
3548143	3550205	Because he can only practice law in Florida.
3550545	3552146	Because we have to be registered there.
3553067	3559552	But no, he's actually only able... Right now, they're still doing a hearing on whether he's going to be disbarred anyway.
3559672	3561493	So that's still pending.
3563086	3569809	Yeah, I was going to say one more thing before I let you guys get going to the next caller.
3570329	3579172	You know, this may be just me, but I think we should probably promote this game as much as possible and get people to buy this game as much as possible.
3579192	3583694	It's just annoying that, you know what, I have this lawyer along with Hillary Clinton.
3584234	3588796	I mean, the more PO these guys get, at least in my book, the better, right?
3589560	3598266	What we really have to do, here's the strategy, is that, I mean, yeah, there's one way to doing it, but what we really have to try and do is not give this guy any credit.
3598286	3601228	We need to stop covering every little move he makes.
3601328	3604770	I mean, and I've used this comparison on the show before a while ago, but I haven't said it in a while.
3605090	3606951	He's the village idiot in our minds.
3607272	3609513	Every time this guy does something, we publish it.
3609833	3612355	Look what the village idiot did today, you know.
3612995	3614616	Look at the lawsuit he filed today.
3614997	3616798	You know, we need to stop giving him attention.
3617058	3617819	It's just like, you know,
3618859	3630987	I don't know about you or any of our listeners or you guys, but when I was getting bullied in school, it's happened to all of us, don't laugh, Rice Princess, but when I was getting bullied in school, my mom always said, don't pay attention to them, and they'll stop.
3631347	3633329	And to a certain extent, she was kind of right.
3633609	3637831	The more you pay attention to these types of things, they go away because they're there to ruffle feathers.
3638512	3639092	That's what they do.
3641014	3642234	You definitely get a point there.
3642755	3643055	Alright.
3643675	3645596	Well, hey, we appreciate the call.
3645616	3647738	Do you have any last quick thoughts before we jump to another call?
3648941	3650542	No, I think that pretty much covers it.
3651022	3652203	Thanks for taking my call.
3652603	3653604	No problemo.
3653724	3654264	Have a good night.
3655025	3655525	Bye, you too.
3656365	3658246	I like hearing from people we don't hear from too often.
3658507	3659567	Yeah, thanks for calling.
3659827	3660107	All right.
3660127	3661008	Yes, we appreciate that.
3661828	3662129	All right.
3662969	3663549	More calls.
3663850	3664890	Now the phone's ringing off the hook.
3664910	3665931	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3665951	3666311	Who's this?
3667151	3668092	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
3668332	3670873	Ranma, I noticed a comment you just made in chat.
3670914	3671394	Bullshit.
3671454	3673375	Even if you do ignore bullies, they will keep at it.
3675416	3677038	That's what my problem was.
3677078	3678700	I got bullied in school.
3679000	3679741	I ignored them.
3680161	3683926	It kept going to the point where I actually had to throw my fists up and get into a few fistfights.
3685367	3686508	I know.
3687309	3692574	I realize that times have also changed from when I was a kid.
3692934	3693795	But I don't know.
3694275	3698620	I always kind of think a lot of people do things for attention.
3698900	3702844	And obviously there's extremes in every circumstance where people are just fucked in the head.
3703224	3705146	But a lot of times people do things for attention.
3705186	3707108	If you don't give them attention, it'll go away.
3707828	3709510	But there are people that...
3710868	3711588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3732287	3732807	Super Mario Kart
3757415	3758977	Do you think this is the best Mario Kart yet?
3759177	3760618	Or do you think it's somewhere in the middle?
3761518	3765601	It's somewhere in the middle because I really dig Mario Kart DS more.
3766682	3770644	But it's that, you know how they said they removed snaking and so forth?
3770764	3772606	If you do it right, you can still do it.
3773086	3779170	I just find it easier to do quote-unquote snaking and power boosting with the control stick than I could with the control pad.
3779430	3786435	You know what's interesting though is I find online people, like, it doesn't seem like people are cheating as much because you have a lot of people on there, you know, that don't,
3787476	3790197	You have a lot of people on there that are playing with the wheel, for one.
3790217	3790678	I noticed that.
3790698	3791979	There's tons of people online playing with the wheel.
3791999	3792919	Yeah, a lot of people on the wheel.
3793399	3797082	And, you know, it just seems like there's less cheating going on.
3797342	3802125	The only cheating in the game, and something I really should have mentioned in Part A when I reviewed the game, here's the irritation I have with the game.
3802946	3805327	The items, I realize it's a part of Mario Kart.
3805367	3805888	It's got to be there.
3805988	3807249	It's a little much.
3807429	3809070	They really needed to scale back.
3809110	3812912	And I think part of that might have to do with them expanding it from like 8 to 12 cars at once.
3813293	3816095	There is just too many freaking blue shells that show up.
3816155	3816595	You know what I mean?
3817596	3818456	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
3818477	3818877	A little much.
3819077	3821199	You ought to be able to turn some of that shit off when playing online.
3822720	3823441	Not yet, no.
3823541	3824321	Can you turn item off?
3824742	3825683	You can turn items off.
3825863	3826243	Oh, nice.
3826423	3828365	Well, all together, but you can't single one out.
3828565	3831728	Yeah, it would be nice if they gave you a little more customization where you can just turn off blue shells.
3831748	3841696	They have it where you can do, like, you know, that the powerful items will appear less, will appear more, will appear normal, but to be honest, playing through each different mode, I have not noticed a difference.
3842337	3842457	Mm-hmm.
3844827	3854470	Well, I have noticed that when you're in first place with prior Mario Kart games, all you had at your disposal were banana peels and green turtle shells.
3854570	3860332	I've noticed now you're getting more powerful items like red turtle shells and other items, too.
3860472	3866794	Once in a blue moon, you get a red turtle shell, but you never get a bullet, and you never get a blue shell, obviously.
3867035	3870936	I've gotten a lot of red shells being in first place, but I've also noticed that when I'm in first place...
3871980	3872860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3901343	3907186	I just love how they brought back the original power boosters and not a remix theme, the original themes.
3907986	3909026	I was really enjoying that.
3910247	3914749	It seems like they've still been slightly retouched, but it's still, it's quality.
3915029	3916509	It's not, you know, they didn't ruin them.
3917550	3920571	Now, Sky, before I go, let me ask you to see if you agree with me.
3920851	3929495	With the Wiimote and Nunchuck controller, do you think it should have been more natural to use the Wiimote when you shake it to throw an item instead of doing tricks?
3931611	3933914	No, because I think it might be too sensitive.
3934074	3938098	And sometimes, you know, you get a little excited, you kind of move around, you hop around, especially if you're getting in the heat of it.
3938618	3942082	I just have a bad feeling that it would, and I sit kind of far away from the TV.
3942462	3947407	So when I'm playing, the sensitivity is kind of, or, you know, if I'm trying to like point at the screen, it's really hard.
3947427	3948989	I got to lean forward to get at the screen.
3949329	3951652	I just have a bad feeling it would screw things up.
3953217	3954338	I'll meet you halfway.
3954358	3958822	They ought to add custom controls where you can assign whatever you want.
3976249	3979751	It's pretty much my return to the West Coast like you wanted me to.
3979791	3983553	It's my return to the West Coast like everybody wanted me to.
4000677	4006220	Well, I do know I am crashing on DarkSakura's couch for three days, which will be pretty awesome.
4006260	4007460	I will be bringing some stuff.
4008001	4010302	And I'll probably bring some New York City trinkets as well.
4011122	4012263	It's Fourth of July weekend?
4013383	4013684	Mm-hmm.
4014244	4019947	You know, if it wasn't summer, I'd say let's have a late birthday party for me at Roseville Golf Land, but it's summer and that's going to suck.
4020953	4023936	Well, we could kind of make an agreement on my birthday's past, too.
4023956	4025577	Maybe we could do something like that together.
4025818	4026658	We'll figure something out.
4026758	4027980	All right, we'll talk more about it offline.
4028000	4028920	The listeners don't want to hear about it.
4028981	4029841	All right, take care, buddy.
4030542	4030862	You too.
4031062	4031363	Bye.
4031403	4031643	Bye.
4032163	4035246	But if you're in Northern California, specifically the Sacramento area...
4036226	4039127	You might want to stay tuned the next few episodes because we're going to do something.
4039167	4040727	I know we have some listeners in the stack area.
4041227	4043128	Loki, quickly, any other last-minute stories?
4043448	4044728	Yes.
4045248	4045868	Let's see here.
4046489	4055651	The ESRB has added some more Xbox Live Arcade games to their list of stuff coming out, including Samurai Shodown 2.
4056091	4061452	Of course, Red Baron for the arcade.
4062073	4062913	Red Baron Arcade.
4064103	4068566	The Revenge of the Plague Lord
4094376	4103121	including Indestructible which is the cover track for that and Inside the Fire.
4105222	4106102	That's kind of interesting.
4107323	4109444	And then let's see here.
4111892	4124586	Guitar Hero 3 this week will be getting three songs from Muse, including Exo-Politics, Supermassive, Black Hole, and Stockholm Syndrome.
4125106	4128050	And they're going to cost 500 Microsoft points.
4129888	4155275	and one other thing we talked a little bit about earlier with the virtual console and people hacking it now they've already hacked and pirated WiiWare games and they have actually brought over some of the Japanese WiiWare games to the North American virtual console you can actually find those online if you're into that kind of thing but I just think it's funny how quickly they've hacked those apart already and
4161516	4162376	And that's pretty much it.
4164657	4173999	Oh, and a rumor of a Blu-ray console coming to the market for, or a Blu-ray included 360 coming to the market in third quarter, although I don't believe that, but we'll see.
4174239	4178140	You know, I was listening to Bobby's show a little bit and he made a pretty good argument for why it is happening.
4178200	4183601	And plus, I think what I said earlier about the whole domino effect, I think it's damn well possible something like that's going to happen.
4184301	4185042	It's just a matter of time.
4185302	4191267	I think it's just going to be hard with, you know, alienating their customers, but if they only use it for video playback, then that's fine.
4191767	4195810	Well, as long as they don't start coming out with Blu-ray games, I absolutely agree with you there.
4196811	4197672	Absolutely agree with you there.
4197952	4198772	Let's go to the phones.
4198812	4199813	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4199833	4200174	Who's this?
4201375	4204577	Hey, hey, DarkDeadSuya, what is on your mind, my friend?
4206218	4212743	Yeah, well, we were letting Loki do some last-minute stories for a little bit before we opened it back up.
4212763	4213224	What's on your mind?
4214008	4214348	Okay.
4217689	4218349	Oh, sure.
4218869	4219589	Ranma, huh?
4220510	4220850	We're here.
4220930	4221230	What's up?
4222850	4225591	You might have to lower the speakers in your house because you're probably hearing feedback.
4225751	4227311	Oh, well, sorry.
4227391	4227951	Yeah, okay.
4228092	4228712	I got it.
4230252	4233713	So, yeah, Ranma has a little Archon, but I had...
4235800	4237801	OLR Central in October
4249720	4254123	We have the Misty Dark Tetsuya OLR Central or whatever they're calling it happening in October.
4254143	4256345	None of which I've heard of, so it's awesome.
4256405	4258506	No, I think they've talked about the October thing before.
4259127	4259947	Here's the deal, buddy.
4260468	4261188	We'll make time.
4261688	4263229	The year is a long time.
4263670	4265311	Definitely we want to meet Misty.
4265471	4267572	Definitely we want to entertain Ranma while he's here.
4267933	4268373	You know what?
4269113	4272035	If other strangers from the internet want to fly out here, why not?
4272135	4272796	Come on over.
4272836	4273576	We'll have a party.
4275860	4278604	My roommate's probably going to kill me for saying that.
4278784	4279666	He loves that idea.
4280226	4281728	But, you know, whatever.
4281769	4283231	We'll make time for it all.
4283371	4284272	I'm not worried about it.
4284332	4287016	And then somebody's going to say, let's do OLR Expo in August.
4289011	4290792	I don't know, I was thinking about that portable Famicom thing.
4290812	4291753	That sounded pretty cool.
4315051	4315491	Yeah, I know.
4315511	4319793	It's not too bad, $40 or $50 considering it's portable and everything.
4319813	4321013	What an awesome piece of retro.
4321033	4325815	I'm going to have to ask Jamie if she's going to pick up one of those.
4325855	4327616	I hear it just plays Nintendo games.
4328621	4328981	It does.
4329081	4330182	It doesn't play any of the other stuff.
4330242	4333623	But, you know, when I was thinking, well, where would you actually be able to get Nintendo games?
4333643	4335504	Because, you know, everybody stopped carrying them a long time ago.
4335804	4337365	Flea markets and garage sales.
4337385	4339465	You can pick shit up for like 50 cents a month.
4339906	4344367	Game craze, or not game crazies, but playing trades, I think, still carry Nintendo.
4344547	4347428	Okay, like there's one of those stores in the Sacramento region.
4347468	4349469	You got to think bigger, big stores.
4349589	4350830	They're a chain.
4351070	4353771	There's like 300 stores in the U.S.
4353911	4354991	I thought there was only one of them here.
4355151	4355331	No.
4355552	4355912	Oh, funny.
4355992	4356632	Okay, my bad.
4358466	4363008	And then there's also, well, locally we've got our record store, Dimple.
4363048	4364528	They carry NES games.
4364588	4375992	You know, when I was in New York City for a new NYOLR con, when I was there last year, we actually all went to a video game store and they had old Nintendo games.
4376032	4379653	I remember because I found a copy of The Guardian Legend, which I bought for my friend.
4379993	4381875	who let me stay at her place in New York City.
4381895	4386899	She lives in Brooklyn and she has an old school Nintendo and I bought it for her and I said, Amanda, that's her name, Amanda.
4387100	4389882	I said, Amanda, this is the best video game of all time.
4390262	4391423	You need to treasure this game.
4391564	4392865	I don't think the bitch has played it yet.
4394326	4395407	She's too busy with WoW.
4396488	4399591	Because Irene, I know Irene called her and was like, Amanda, Kara's there.
4400211	4400792	She's like, yep.
4400952	4402353	Even though I don't think Irene's ever talked to her.
4402393	4402734	But anyway.
4403885	4406226	Video Games New York was the name of the store, according to Ranma.
4407806	4410607	All right, DT, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
4412187	4414728	Oh, well, I just hope Grady 2 comes out in the U.S.
4415288	4415488	What?
4415908	4416569	2 comes out in the U.S.?
4417649	4417989	Grady 2.
4418709	4419609	Ooh, I hope so, too.
4419770	4420050	You know what?
4420110	4423551	I think the odds of seeing that are much more than Cho and Iki here in the U.S.
4423751	4424771	Oh, God, yeah.
4426431	4427872	All right, DT, take care.
4427912	4428652	Have a good week, okay?
4428672	4429512	And we'll see you in October.
4429532	4430052	Yeah, you too.
4430272	4430593	All right.
4431073	4431553	See you later.
4431613	4431973	Bye-bye.
4432423	4432923	Thank you for watching!
4457665	4458146	RicePrincess
4474562	4476063	Yeah, oh, you should hang it, too.
4476103	4476483	We're getting it.
4476503	4477983	We're going to hang the question mark block from the ceiling.
4478003	4484586	I'm going to put Tack and hang the question mark block, and then we'll put the mushrooms around, and we can put, like, Cartman and some of these other things they see on Justin.TV on the mushrooms.
4484886	4491209	But first, we have to fix Justin.TV by actually wiring the Mac in, because the feed on Justin.TV sucks right now, so we've got to fix that.
4491529	4497772	By the way, speaking of Justin.TV, real quick, did you hear about some of our friends over on Justin.TV got their stream shut down?
4497792	4498292	What?
4498312	4500253	Take two, put the smack down, just for a day.
4500293	4501453	They only got a 24-hour ban.
4501473	4503114	They got some archives deleted, but apparently...
4503414	4503634	Outro Music
4526918	4527959	We had to hide our footage.
4527979	4528799	Our footage is still there.
4528839	4529340	We had to hide it.
4529360	4530541	But we only did like 10 minutes.
4530561	4536965	And if they had shut us down for 10, I would have thrown a fit because IGN and these other sites probably have way more than 10 minutes worth of video.
4536985	4538346	It's all on YouTube now too.
4538486	4539166	For real.
4539246	4539867	It's retarded.
4540287	4543149	Although Shadow Next Gen in chat says a bunch of YouTube videos were deleted too.
4543789	4544610	That's just stupid.
4544950	4546191	Free publicity for your game.
4546471	4547992	But see, they're just bullies.
4548472	4550014	You know, I would say we should boycott them.
4550034	4551735	We should ignore them, Rob.
4551775	4553516	Let's stop talking about it right now.
4553536	4554117	Well, that's fine.
4554197	4556078	I'll boycott their other smaller games.
4556178	4556719	Good idea.
4557099	4558700	You know, they've got the 2K series.
4558740	4560421	Well, I don't like sports, so that's fine.
4561342	4564765	They've got their stupid, what, tennis game.
4564885	4566486	Their Rockstar's Table Tennis.
4566786	4568267	Fuck your table tennis in the ass.
4568387	4569328	I ain't playing that shit.
4569948	4571309	And then they've got...
4572563	4574804	Well, they've got Dora the Explorer, which is shit.
4576524	4586186	They've also got Mafia, which is coming out, and Noir, but when the fuck are those going to come out forever from now?
4588487	4588847	That's fine.
4589107	4591187	All I buy is Grand Theft Auto.
4592128	4594288	Any final thoughts from you, Rice Princess?
4594308	4598309	Thank you for being here tonight and giving us a female perspective when DarkSakura was unable to.
4599295	4599956	You're welcome.
4600056	4600356	All right.
4600436	4601157	Any final thoughts?
4601538	4603541	I'm going to get myself a banana.
4605023	4605824	No one gets that.
4605984	4606465	That's all right.
4607466	4611812	My final thought is actually a fruit salad sounds pretty yummy right now.
4612073	4613194	Yummy, yummy.
4613395	4614316	Yeah, I know.
4614336	4614757	I don't get that.
4615217	4617360	Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
4617380	4621425	Hey, if you like what you hear here on Orange Lounge Radio, please tell two friends about our show.
4621745	4622766	Tell two enemies about our show.
4622786	4623147	I don't care.
4623187	4629895	Just tell two people about our show because that's how word of mouth spreads and more people everywhere find out about Orange Lounge Radio.
4630376	4634060	And without you and your support, independent radio would be dead.
4634761	4635862	But thanks to you, it's still alive.
4636062	4639183	You know, I heard that because I was giving out our cards during the Zappos.
4639203	4643065	I was like just about to play the outgoing music, but what, what, Loki?
4643185	4647147	I was handing out our cards at the Zappos thing, and they're going to put it on their little blog site.
4647667	4647767	Oh.
4648107	4648548	Really?
4648668	4649208	How nice of them.
4649288	4650028	Awesome.
4650469	4651029	All right, cool.
4651909	4653170	We're getting out there a little more.
4653210	4653430	Woo-hoo!
4655084	4656746	That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
