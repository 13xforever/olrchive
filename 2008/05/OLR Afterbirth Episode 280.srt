1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
By the way, this is part of the show. It's too hot to podcast blah blah blah low-key has brought another edition of

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,880
Secret club tonight

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,440
For those of you who don't know what secret club is secret club is where we're going to tell you some secrets

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,040
About things that will be happening in the game industry very soon however

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,680
There is a rule that goes with secret club and that is that you don't talk about secret club in other words

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
You're going to hear some things on here

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,680
You don't say you heard him here because we've gotten in trouble over stuff before and we just don't care to have the limelight

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,740
Anymore, it's really not that important to us so that being said secret club rules one

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,280
It's just it's you know really juicy stuff that you got to tell somebody so I know a lot of people were disappointed with

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,440
Capcom not porting over resident evil zero over here only Japan's getting it and you know everyone liked resident evil

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,600
For we and stuff well they are porting a game over. It's not resident evil though. It's

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,780
Another game also happens to have dead things running around

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
in

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,420
January

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,740
Dead rising coming through the wii yay, so that would be pretty cool. That could be interesting

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:15,980
Also, they have a pretty strong lineup for the winner so far one that's been delayed bionic commando as actually now set in

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
February

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,180
Hopefully that sticks resident evil 5 in March and Street Fighter 4 in January

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,740
Of course the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,860
That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4 January. Yeah, well. There's another I read another story though

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,420
From juice France those in the same thing. They said a winner release for it, so it fits so all right

22
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,620
It's a good spot to put it. I mean cuz there's nothing comes out in January. That's it

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
All right, we're gonna do something very special now, and I'm gonna leave I'm leaving

24
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm running to the store because we're gonna do cake and I need to get some plates and some forks and all that good stuff

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,260
And I need some other stuff myself so this store happens to be just down the street and around the corner

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,380
So I should be back in no more than 10 minutes, so you guys gonna. Time me how long I'm gone

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180
We have exactly 10 minutes to run

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,380
Showing time you guys are gonna run the show talk about whatever you want fill time

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,540

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,860
Have fun. I'll flash my cleavage all right, so you

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,420
Is this the race in my mind? Okay, so somebody's got to say on your mark get set go okay ready?

32
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,900
He's gonna get in a car accident die

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,700
That's games timer is running. Maybe we'll be able to do a show next week cuz he'll be dead

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,660
I don't want to sit in Rob's chair, but I want to fuck up his computer

35
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
Can't hear you the windows closed

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:03:03,540
Uh-huh, that's Rob's alarm that doesn't do any good. He's running

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,020
Don't understand why why does he not have plates that's what I said, that's not what I said like I

38
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,980
offered to wash

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,220
the plates

40
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm gonna go buy some so that my cosplayer has some pretty awesome cleavage

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,700
You've gotta have those did Rob say part B. I don't know

42
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,120
Let's close the computer down yes

43
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,600
Whoa shit my mic was off. I was

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:47,080
I can't be a host rather than Mike. Oh no. Oscar told me to say boob ten times, so I'm gonna say it ready boob ten times on air XD

45
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Har-har-har, this was said

46
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
You know I need to add a thread for a thread with auto in

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,200
The ole army thing I've been playing a few people

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,760
It's been fun, but most of the time I get invited to games and no one knows who I am

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,920
So just a reminder for all our army people I believe there is a group for steam

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,800
I believe there's also is a clan on X fire might want to join it true because it's getting kind of lonely

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Pass the mic over

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Pass the mic over

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,480
You may like it, but women have precedents because we have boobs

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:36,440
Awesome, you know what I'm gonna. Do I'm gonna go to the bathroom a game. Thanks. We are hijacking the afterbirth officially

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,080
Oh my god always does this

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,600
Okay, okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
And this is what happens when women run show

58
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,760
We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics we hate the scrolls

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
they suck so bad and

60
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
um and they suck

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,760
They do suck and they turn green well. They are green, but they turn into other people

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,360
And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a scroll for all we know half the chat room could be scrolled

63
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Andrew could be a scroll, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green. I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:40,800
The show makes me turn green. Scroll!

65
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay, act death protests and toshin protests and a bunch of people said that they're not scroll so that means they are

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
You just want us to

67
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
If you say you aren't a scroll, you are a scroll

68
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Do they weigh less than a duck?

69
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
I mean we can find out

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,000
And don't eat us cuz you can't become us

71
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Wait different universe. Sorry

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
And cheeseburger if you have to ask it means you are one

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Yes, the Hulk does turn green actually the Hulk turns gray and red and

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,720
He in one universe he eats people's brains damn the Patriots and poops them out I

75
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,480
Just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to save his poo

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Because it had alien matter. No no it had alien rubber bands in it

77
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,720
You know not what you just what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom I

78
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,520
I keep comics in my bathroom everybody just die monster. You don't belong in this world

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,520
I do okay the comics in my bathroom right now is that three volumes of the ultimates I?

80
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,660
Have I'm sorry one

81
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,400
And I know it's why exiles cuz it's awesome, and you suck. Why God why?

82
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,360
Can I kill him ultimate volume one and two

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,440
You're actually not supposed to like it supposedly if you like Marvel

84
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,360
But it's actually better written than the actual Avengers ha ha ha I said it see how easily provoked Jamie is I?

85
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,320
Actually have nothing against the ultimate series I

86
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,640
Have everything against you though, so it's okay. I

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Know I know

88
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:32,120
So if you're into comics if you were into the Iron Man movie there is a new invincible Iron Man series that came out

89
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Not this last week, but the week before you'll probably be able to find it in

90
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,640
Your local comic book store. It's a good starting point for people who have

91
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,820
Seen the movie and want to learn more about Iron Man, but have never read any of the comics

92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
the main villain so far is

93
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,280
Jebediah stain who is the son of Obadiah stain the main villain from the Iron Man movie you'll see

94
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,600
And you'll see roadie, and it's it's a very good comic a good writer good artist well

95
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,080
Yeah, okay artist. I'm not too happy with art, but overall a good recommendation for a comic

96
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Rob has now been gone for five minutes and 45 seconds

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Five minutes have elapsed

98
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,900
Another good comic this week was x-men divided we stand number two

99
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:35,580
Which is one of the Messiah complex comics dealing with the x-men featuring?

100
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
That's what you were reading earlier

101
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,260
I have downloaded it and have yet to read it because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill

102
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Series that I'm waiting on to be finished

103
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,180
My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a

104
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,780
A contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill

105
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:08,060
Happens I want to go to the best place ever you want to run off to Silent Hill. You'll have a killer good time

106
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,020
Herman Herman head goes fast for tonight

107
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
No

108
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
He has to drag around that great knife

109
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
So how was Mighty Avengers

110
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,700
Mighty Avengers is very interesting because it's fantastic wasn't it it was more scroll tastic

111
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,180
But it was more or less Bob is nuts the comic. Yeah

112
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,740
basically

113
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,700
another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe is the

114
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Captain Marvel short series

115
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,980
Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many many years ago, but they brought him back

116
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,340
And I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing

117
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,740
But the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good

118
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,920
And it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback

119
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,660
I've been told to say something. I can't normally say around Rob. Okay, I

120
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,420
Don't say whatever the fuck I want around Rob so maybe um

121
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
What's something that really grosses Rob out

122
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
kind of ritual sex

123
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,620
There I said it he likes boobies

124
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,460
All men like boobies. It doesn't matter if they're gay. Yeah, I remember one time at Disneyland

125
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
What

126
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
He only sucks if you pay him

127
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,740
Only if you're female, sorry lalalala lalala lalalala lalalalala

128
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:54,020
Lali lu they know I suggested that I say vagina I can say that around Rob though. We saw Margaret Cho. Hi

129
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,020
This is a woman who's part of her stand-up comedy was about her period so no that doesn't work I

130
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:09,900
I like what she said though. She said that if Richard Pryor had a period he would talk about it. How do you guy?

131
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,900
now

132
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,400
Well, you're not housing a hottie. How do you guy why not?

133
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,700
Because I'm sitting down you should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can

134
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
stop

135
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:34,240
Oh, yes, I know what Rob doesn't like Rob doesn't like looking at girls butts

136
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,080
He likes that song right yes nine minutes have elapsed

137
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:52,080
You know what Rob lied to us he lied to me he's never coming back

138
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,020
Probably right and he probably got into a car accident. The cake is a lie

139
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,400
Given that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store

140
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,980
And then you have to go in and get plates, and then you have to pay for plates

141
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,080
You know what we should do we should go to grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake

142
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,080
And go I guess guess what Rob you know that bet he's doing what he's buying a present

143
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,160
He's getting you a Walmart gift card

144
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,720
I should've told him to buy candles, and then you could all sing me happy birthday, and I could I'm doing it right now nine eight

145
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,960
seven six five four three

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
two one

147
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,420
time

148
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,480
My mommy just texted it at me. What'd your mom have to say happy Memorial Day tomorrow?

149
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm saying thanks mommy. Happy my birthday weekend

150
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,000
and

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,560
Happy DJ Ranma s birthday weekend

152
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
time

153
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,920
And happy Lenny Kravitz birthday weekend even though. I'm not really into any of his music Rob you're late

154
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:14,560
Train wreck-a-rama we has Rex Metal Gear

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So I told Rob to get candles I

156
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Told Rob to get bent

157
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,760
There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called love

158
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:40,080
It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid the love of a staunch true man the love of a baby unafraid have

159
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,360
Existed since time began, but the greatest of loves the quintessence of loves even greater than that of a mother

160
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,120
It's the tender passionate infinite love of one drunken marine for another

161

Yes, he did

275
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,380
That was his defense if the bad guys ever came in there. He would just take his boots off

276
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,620
It probably worked in my work

277

00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:05,540
Hey, that's true we did have home with ready for all right here. We got some classic rock the bagels with birthday enjoy

00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Oh

304
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,180
Oh

305
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Oh

306
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Oh

307
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,940
So on number two in tonight's cage match a little bit of classic

308
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,000
Is Jamie just screw up the camp a little bit of classic stuff. I'll fix it

309
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:01,300
Let it point is feeling a little bit. Okay a little bit of classic rock with the Beatles and birthday

310
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,820
You say it's your birthday. What do you say? What would you write that song though? We'll start with Yara

311
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Let's work our way around the circle

312
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Oh, it's the Beatles. It's White Album. It's classic rock. It gets a 10.

313
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,820
A 10 from T-ara, Dark Soccer. It gets a 10 because T-ara said so.

314
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,140
That song still holds up very well today. I give it a eight and a half

315
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,860
Drew it gets a 10 because T-ara already said so

316
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,580
Loki I'm not buying into this whole T-ara says thing so it gets an average six from me

317
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:40,500
All right, because it's an average song. All right, Loki. Then what pray tell did you bring to the listening public today at song number three?

318
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,780
I picked a song by a group called methods of mayhem may not recognize this group, but it's actually Tommy Lee

319
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,580
Producing music that unlike Tommy Lee, but it's a rock rap group, but trust me the song is pretty good

320
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,660

346
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
We've had to fill enough time tonight

347
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,120
Yes. All right. We're ready to go and arrive already. All right, then let's go with the chat effuse

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,960
More will probably come in as you start to read the one Oscar says at you to sky for missing his time limit

350
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,280
But then again, it doesn't matter because it was fun while he was gone

351
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,640
Well, we try to say this shows more fun without me here. I

352
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,400
Freaking adore Oscar. Okay, Oscar is like

355
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Oscar is great

356
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,920
But it better be in a nice way that you love my mom

357
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
I love my mommy too

358
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,280
Rana a few people who missed up on the debauchery of my 30th last night before bastards

359
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,120
That would be us. I missed out

360
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,440
Maybe maybe that should be amended to those who are in a position to attend yet. Yes

361
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:24,440
I hereby Boyd Rama's that you don't look good. Actually, I am amended but with another proposal to do everyone for I know I'm in

362
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,000
I was fine. I don't care. I think you're on snake by power of estrogen

363
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Say more effuse

364
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
And he said

365
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,800
More effuse not more breaking of my computer

366
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,120

00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,680
And I'm telling you this it's gone like I told you last time like I told you earlier today

370
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,920
The email you sent six weeks ago is gone

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:11,680
If you want an email read send another email and we'll see and we'll see I

372
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,400
Skipped a lot of emails. Okay, just because I pass yours up

373
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
once or twice

374
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,120
Does not mean that I hate you

375
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,120
I

376
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Had to read it

377
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Jamie is the goddamn Batman

378
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,680
And she hates chocolate. I am the goddamn Batman. I am the goddamn chocolate Batman. I

379
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
I

380
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,400
Don't think anyone's running a recording right now, you're screwed

381
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,060
Death says eff you to not having money by the way your mom

382
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:06,140
A lot more now than for us when I was growing up

383
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,940
My mind went straight to the gutter to my mind is the gutter

384
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,780
Mommy, you can't take my TV away cuz daddy got that for me and you taking it would be best. I was a brat

385
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,140
So to have my mom be as cool as she is now with me being such an ungrateful little brat

386
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,140
My mom is super awesome

387
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,980
Rob I don't think you can really let your mind go to the gutter about Timmy's mom being a screamer

388
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:52,260
Oh fuck someone's recording

389
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,340
By the way, according to Oscar, this is seriously the best afterbirth ever long it's going on forever

390
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,340
This is so busted. Tyrol says eff you to decay bongos that waste space on my shelf and attract spiders

391
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Sauce is the best guest ever. Rebo boy for three sisters eff you to Voldemort

392
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:31,180
The males are having a huddle

393
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,780
Believe it or not. It's not about you

394
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,140
What exactly is the chocolate Batman I don't know you said that's you so why don't you tell us all right

395
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,100
All right

396
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:58,500
Kill the music these FUs are over. Stop. No more FUs. All right, how about a cage match wiener?

397
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,880
Somebody weaned the cage match tonight. It's like a baby

398
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,500
What?

399
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,580
And the cage match winner is actually close vote time to make all three songs

400
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,820
Bass drum one

401
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:23,980
Maybe doing Grover impressions on Justin TV for some weird reason. All right

402
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,300
We are finally ready to put the nail in the coffin of this damn show. Yeah

403
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,900
All right, it's now 1 a.m. On the East Coast

404
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,860
All right, I know the YouTube has been so slow on my computer lately

405
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,140
But of course everybody has been like leeching bandwidth. So that's what happens. That's right

406
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,420
It'll it'll finish before we're done. So that's gonna do it for tonight's orange launch radio

407
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,020
Anybody have to say anything before we turn it back over to all games?

408
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,580

409
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,740

00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,740
Really really like cake. All right

411
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,900
We're going to the fortune cookie message of the day now as chosen by drew because he felt it was appropriate tonight

412
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,180
So if you hate this fortune cookie message, what's your email?

413
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,180
Classified whatever I'll find it for you and give it to you here it is fortune cookie message of the day

414
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
You

415

That was those cute to watch it when I'm at an angle that I can see it

423
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,700
This by the way was the leech Street boys

424
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:13,060
That was cute. I approve good times. All right

425
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:19,580
We are officially pulling the plug on orange launch radio tonight and we're gonna be turning it over to all games radio

426
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,320
Of course the lovely radio station that hosts our show on Sunday night

427
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,980
We appreciate it the next live program on all games radio will be all games interactive

428
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:34,200
I'm actually not sure if they're live tomorrow though, but I'll just assume they are their show is on at noon now

429
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,020
They've moved to noon. So that's three o'clock Eastern

430
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,860
So stay tuned for all games interactive and in the meantime, you're 24. Oh, yeah, we do anything on just TV

431
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,240

435
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:20,900
