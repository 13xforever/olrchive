1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:02,712
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, this is part of the show, it's too hot to podcast, blah blah blah.

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has brought another edition of Secret Club tonight.

3
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:15,644
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who don't know what Secret Club is, Secret Club is where we're going to tell you some secrets about things that will be happening in the game industry very soon.

4
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:20,769
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there is a rule that goes with Secret Club and that is that you don't talk about Secret Club.

5
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:23,230
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, you're going to hear some things on here.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,232
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't say you heard them here because we've gotten in trouble over stuff before and we just don't care to have the limelight anymore.

7
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not that important to us.

8
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So that being said, Secret Club.

9
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:34,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Rules 1 and 2.

10
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really juicy stuff that you've got to tell somebody.

11
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:44,458
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know a lot of people were disappointed with Capcom not porting over Resident Evil 0 over here.

12
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Only Japan's getting it.

13
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone liked Resident Evil 3.

14
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,264
[SPEAKER_04]: for Wii and stuff.

15
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:51,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they are porting a game over.

16
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Resident Evil, though.

17
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:55,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another game.

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Also happens to have dead things running around.

19
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:00,554
[SPEAKER_04]: January.

20
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:03,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising, coming through the Wii.

21
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Bionic Commando Resident Evil 5 Street Fighter 4

22
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:30,078
[SPEAKER_04]: and, of course, the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

23
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,799
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4.

24
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,380
[SPEAKER_03]: January?

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's another... I read another story, though, from Juice Francis saying the same thing.

27
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:41,106
[SPEAKER_04]: They said a winter release for it, so it fits.

28
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:42,527
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

29
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for Secret Club?

30
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:46,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good spot to put it, I mean, because there's something that comes out in January.

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:47,830
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

32
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:48,871
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

33
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:51,753
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do something very special now, and I'm going to leave.

34
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:52,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm leaving...

35
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:59,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running to the store because we're going to do cake and I need to get some plates and some forks and all that good stuff and I need some other stuff myself.

36
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:04,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So the store happens to be just down the street and around the corner.

37
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So I should be back in no more than 10 minutes.

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you guys going to time me how long I'm gone?

39
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We have exactly 10 minutes to run the show into the ground.

40
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,980
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, you guys are going to run the show.

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about whatever you want.

42
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill time.

43
00:02:18,982 --> 00:02:19,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Interact with chatters.

44
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:21,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Take off your top for Justin TV.

45
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:22,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

46
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:24,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

47
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:25,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll flash my cleavage.

48
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the race?

49
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,030
[SPEAKER_06]: In my mind.

50
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so somebody's got to say on your mark, get set, go.

51
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:30,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, ready?

52
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready, set, go.

53
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:37,178
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to get in a car accident and die.

54
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gonna be sad.

55
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:40,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Timer is running.

56
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:42,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we won't be able to do a show next week because he'll be dead.

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to sit in Rob's chair, but I want to fuck up his computer.

58
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:48,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I'm screaming with your computer!

59
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't hear you.

60
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:50,986
[SPEAKER_04]: The window's closed.

61
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear him running through his car.

62
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:59,273
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear that, everybody?

63
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:01,695
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Rob's alarm that doesn't do any good.

64
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:03,596
[SPEAKER_04]: He's running.

65
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:04,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

66
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:08,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't understand, why does he not have plates?

67
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I said, isn't that what I said?

68
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:16,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I offered to wash the plates.

69
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,381
[SPEAKER_12]: And yet?

70
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm gonna go buy some.

71
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:22,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So that my cosplayer has some pretty awesome cleavage.

72
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You've gotta have boobs.

73
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:27,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Rob save Part B?

74
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:29,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

75
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I saw him save Part B. Let's close the computer down and guess.

76
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:37,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit, my mic was off.

77
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't be a host without a mic.

78
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.

79
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Osfer told me to say boob ten times.

80
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to say it.

81
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:43,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready?

82
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Boob ten times on air.

83
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:47,184
[SPEAKER_06]: XD.

84
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:49,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Har har har.

85
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:50,346
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he said.

86
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:55,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I need to add a thread for Trendeth Auto.

87
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,982
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Ola Army thing.

88
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:00,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a few people.

89
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:01,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been fun.

90
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the time I get invited to games and no one knows who I am.

91
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:07,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a reminder for Ola Army people.

92
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:11,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe there is a group for Steam.

93
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,996
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe there also is a clan on Xfire.

94
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike, want to join it?

95
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:15,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew.

96
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's getting kind of lonely.

97
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Pass the mic over.

98
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Pass the mic over.

99
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:22,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the mic.

100
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:26,597
[SPEAKER_06]: You may like it, but women have precedence because we have boobs.

101
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

102
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm going to do?

103
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the bathroom.

104
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play a game.

105
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:33,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Fix it.

106
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:36,486
[SPEAKER_06]: We are hijacking the afterbirth officially.

107
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:37,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Fix it.

108
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I play Rob.

109
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:39,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

110
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,170
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because Rob always does this.

111
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:42,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:42,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

113
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:42,572
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

114
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,980
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what happens when women run a show.

115
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Men are hopeless.

116
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:04,526
[SPEAKER_06]: We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics.

117
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:05,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, comics!

118
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,028
[SPEAKER_06]: We hate the Skrulls!

119
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Skrulls suck.

120
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,611
[SPEAKER_06]: They suck so bad.

121
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:11,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And they suck.

122
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,253
[SPEAKER_00]: They do suck.

123
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And they turn green.

124
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:15,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they are green.

125
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,117
[SPEAKER_06]: But they turn into other people.

126
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:18,478
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn into other people.

127
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:20,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a Skrull.

128
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,562
[SPEAKER_06]: For all we know, half the chatroom can be Skrulls.

129
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew could be a Skrull, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green.

130
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me.

131
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,522
[SPEAKER_12]: This show makes me turn green.

132
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Skrull!

133
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:47,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Actdeft protests and Toshin protests, and a bunch of people said that they're not Skrulls, so that means they are.

134
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:52,187
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want us to... If you say you aren't a Skrull, you are a Skrull.

135
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:53,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they weigh less than a duck?

136
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,421
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we can find out.

137
00:05:58,661 --> 00:05:59,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't eat us.

138
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can't become us.

139
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:03,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, different universe.

140
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:03,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

141
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And Cheeseburger, if you have to ask, it means you are one.

142
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the Hulk does turn green.

143
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the Hulk turns gray.

144
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And red.

145
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And in one universe, he eats people's brains.

146
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:26,523
[SPEAKER_06]: and Poops the Mount.

147
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to say it was poo.

148
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it had alien matter in it.

149
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,031
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, it had alien rubber bands in it.

150
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: You know not what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom.

151
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep comics in my bathroom, everybody.

152
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:46,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Die, monster.

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,641
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't belong in this world.

154
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I love comics in her bathroom.

155
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:52,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the comics in my bathroom right now have three volumes of The Ultimates.

156
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Spider-Man one.

157
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry for you.

158
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:58,283
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, Ultimates, why?

159
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Exiles, because it's awesome and you suck.

160
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:01,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Why God, why?

161
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:04,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I kill him?

162
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:12,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimates Volume 1 and 2, you're actually not supposed to like it, supposedly, if you like Marvel, but it's actually better written than the actual Avengers.

163
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:13,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha, I said it.

164
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:15,196
[SPEAKER_12]: See how easily provoked Jamie is?

165
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually have nothing against the Ultimates series.

166
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I have everything against you, though, so it's okay.

167
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I know

168
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:43,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoilers Spoilers

169
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob has now been gone for 5 minutes and 45 seconds.

170
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Five minutes have elapsed.

171
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:28,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good comic this week was X-Men Divided We Stand No.

172
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:37,069
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, which is one of the Messiah Complex comics dealing with the X-Men, featuring Beast, who is my favorite.

173
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you were reading earlier, wasn't it?

174
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I was reading earlier.

175
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:48,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I have downloaded it and have yet to read it, because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill series that I'm waiting on to be finished.

176
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,533
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your Silent Hill comic?

177
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:59,020
[SPEAKER_06]: My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill!

178
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:00,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Dun dun dun!

179
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know what happens.

180
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:06,106
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go to the best place ever, you want to run off to Silent Hill.

181
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,207
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have a killer good time.

182
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:11,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha.

183
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Pyramid Head goes faster at night.

184
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:15,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no.

185
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:18,896
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to drag around that great knife.

186
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,883
[SPEAKER_00]: So how was Mighty Avengers?

187
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Mighty Avengers was very interesting.

188
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,005
[SPEAKER_00]: It was scrolltastic, wasn't it?

189
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:29,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more scrolltastic, but it was more or less Bob is Nuts, the comic.

190
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:31,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically.

191
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:40,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe, is the Captain Marvel short series.

192
00:09:42,248 --> 00:10:01,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many, many years ago but they brought him back and I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing but the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good and it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback.

193
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:05,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told to say something I can't normally say around Rob.

194
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:06,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

195
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:11,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I normally say whatever the fuck I want around Rob, so... I was gonna say.

196
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:16,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, um... What's something that really grosses Rob out?

197
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:18,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Heterosexual sex.

198
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There, I said it.

199
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,711
[SPEAKER_06]: He likes boobies.

200
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:26,412
[SPEAKER_00]: All men like boobies.

201
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:27,653
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if they're gay.

202
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:28,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

203
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:33,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember one time at Disneyland... What?

204
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:40,429
[SPEAKER_06]: He only sucks if you pay him.

205
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:43,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Only if you're female, sorry.

206
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:46,415
[SPEAKER_06]: La la la la la la la.

207
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,016
[SPEAKER_12]: La li lu la lo.

208
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Osprey suggested that I say vagina.

209
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say that around Rob, though.

210
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,162
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw Margaret Cho, hi.

211
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:00,668
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a woman whose part of her stand-up comedy was about her period.

212
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:02,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, that doesn't work.

213
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I like what she said, though.

214
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:08,252
[SPEAKER_06]: She said that if Richard Pryor had a period, he would talk about it.

215
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone, hare hare yukai.

216
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:11,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Now.

217
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not housing a hare hare yukai.

218
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:15,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

219
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm sitting down.

220
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:25,583
[SPEAKER_00]: You should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can stop being comic book dorks.

221
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot Laptop is hot.

222
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I know what Rob doesn't like.

223
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob doesn't like looking at girls' butts.

224
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,133
[SPEAKER_06]: But he likes that song.

225
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:39,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

226
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:40,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

227
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Nine minutes have elapsed.

228
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:45,978
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

229
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob lied to us.

230
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,781
[SPEAKER_12]: He lied to me.

231
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,203
[SPEAKER_00]: He's never coming back.

232
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:52,923
[SPEAKER_00]: The cake is a lie.

233
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store.

234
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to go in and get plates.

235
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,144
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to pay for plates.

236
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:06,165
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we should do?

237
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:09,207
[SPEAKER_06]: We should go grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake.

238
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And go, guess what, Rob?

239
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I bet he's doing?

240
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,011
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

241
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet he's buying a present.

242
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:16,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

243
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,215
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting you a Walmart gift card.

244
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:25,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have told them to buy candles and then you could all sing me happy birthday and I could... I'm doing it right now.

245
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:35,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, time.

246
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,541
[SPEAKER_06]: My mommy just texted it to me.

247
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:39,982
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd your mom have to say?

248
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Memorial Day tomorrow.

249
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:43,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying thanks, mommy.

250
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy my birthday weekend.

251
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And happy DJ Ranma S birthday weekend.

252
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:52,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Time!

253
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And happy Lenny Kravitz birthday weekend, even though I'm not really into any of his music.

254
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:01,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, you're late.

255
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Trainwreck-a-rama, we has wrecks.

256
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:11,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Metal Gear?

257
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:21,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I told Rob to get candles.

258
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:25,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it, read it, read it.

259
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:25,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I told Rob to get bent.

260
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:32,978
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called Love.

261
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:42,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid, the love of a staunch true man, the love of a baby unafraid have existed since time began.

262
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:52,252
[SPEAKER_00]: But the greatest of loves, the quintessence of loves, even greater than that of a mother, is the tender, passionate, infinite love of one drunken marine for another.

263
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:54,628
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fantastic.

264
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is late, late, late, late.

265
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is late, late, late, late.

266
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is late.

267
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,769
[SPEAKER_12]: 11 minutes, 25 seconds.

268
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Fired!

269
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get your text until I was pulling in the driveway.

270
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,691
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a butt.

271
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:08,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

272
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:08,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Fired.

273
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,891
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Rob, I could, we could have used the dishes.

274
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

275
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:15,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have loaded the dishwasher.

276
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:20,193
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you would have had to have been here to, like, clean the dishes.

277
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some pretzels and chips for me.

278
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:25,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, Tris gets redesigned their package.

279
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:26,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that something?

280
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did I miss?

281
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:37,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, you missed the hurricane.

282
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:40,398
[SPEAKER_12]: It came in, it rocked us like a hurricane, and then it left.

283
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:41,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

284
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the scorpions reference.

285
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Anytime.

286
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know what the hell my mom is doing up at 11.30.

287
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,084
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't have to work tomorrow.

288
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:58,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob!

289
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,205
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a holiday.

290
00:14:59,225 --> 00:14:59,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Call my mother.

291
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:01,907
Right now?

292
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:02,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, right now.

293
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:06,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

294
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a mic, so I'm just... Do you want your mic back?

295
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:10,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

296
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:12,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pretend to be Rob.

297
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rob.

298
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,540
[SPEAKER_00]: This is better than a drunk show.

299
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I have fabulous hair.

300
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:17,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.

301
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wearing a nice shirt.

302
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my mom's phone number, so hold on for a second.

303
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:24,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am dialing Jamie's mom on Skype.

304
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:25,225
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

305
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:26,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob.

306
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:28,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

307
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:28,767
[SPEAKER_12]: It's safe.

308
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Reminder.

309
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:29,687
[SPEAKER_12]: It's safe.

310
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:30,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

311
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Ladies and gentlemen, Part B is safe.

312
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:33,309
[SPEAKER_12]: So shut up.

313
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:34,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, mobile?

314
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:34,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

315
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here we go.

316
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:38,211
[SPEAKER_06]: You've called my mom before.

317
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:38,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Give him a mic.

318
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:39,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Give him a mic.

319
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hear it.

320
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:57,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ringing.

321
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:57,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's connecting still.

322
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:08,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

323
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mom.

324
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:11,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

325
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you texted me, I thought it was okay to call you.

326
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:15,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm still up.

327
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

328
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:17,841
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

329
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,103
[SPEAKER_06]: You're live on Orange Sounds Radio again.

330
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:21,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boy.

331
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot more people are listening now.

332
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Jamie's mom.

333
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

334
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,210
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Drew.

335
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tiara's here.

336
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:30,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mom.

337
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tiara.

338
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:37,578
[SPEAKER_01]: How are y'all doing out there in sunny California?

339
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:38,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It is nighttime.

340
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:40,919
[SPEAKER_12]: The night is young.

341
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was sunny all the time in California.

342
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's only on movie sets.

343
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you're on acid.

344
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And you remember Rob, right?

345
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:54,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

346
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

347
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:55,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?

348
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:58,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine.

349
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:58,663
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

350
00:16:58,743 --> 00:16:58,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

351
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,583
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got lots of comments from chat.

352
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:03,004
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Siren says, Hi, Jamie's mom.

353
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty says, Hi, Jamie's mom.

354
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:05,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold Banjo says, Hi.

355
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Ty Rules says, Tell her Ty Rules loves her.

356
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:15,735
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep our chat room patched in during the show, so everyone is saying hi.

357
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:17,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's very cool.

358
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:19,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I was feeling kind of lonely.

359
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody loves my mom.

360
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:24,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Memorial Day, Mommy.

361
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:35,350
[SPEAKER_06]: She named her child after the... Yeah, okay, I have to tell you, because everyone who listens to the show knows me as Jamie Summers, and that's in tribute to you naming me after the Bionic Woman.

362
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

363
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they know that a little six-year-old girl picked out that name?

364
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:45,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she thought it'd be very cool to name you a demonic woman?

365
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I've told this story online before.

366
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just glad you didn't name me Erica.

367
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:52,837
[SPEAKER_01]: But after Erica Strada?

368
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:54,617
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you were going to name me Erica.

369
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:58,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, and I wanted to, but Granddaddy couldn't say it.

370
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And Papa got pissed off that you named me Erica.

371
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, and he called me Maury.

372
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:09,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know, Akuma JP says hello from Japan to Jamie's mom.

373
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:09,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

374
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:14,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tigerclaw wants you to tell an embarrassing story, but I'm vetoing that request.

375
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:20,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you've already told the condensation story, and you've already told the projectile pooping story.

376
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Both were wonderful.

377
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,839
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want me to tell that again?

378
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,160
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

379
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Foodie Monster says hi from Argentina.

380
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to talk about where it's sitting all the time.

381
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:35,134
[SPEAKER_06]: From Argentina.

382
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:37,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have listeners from all over the world.

383
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:39,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

384
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft says hi from Mexico.

385
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, you kind of echoed a little bit.

386
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one of our listeners, Actdeft, says hi from Mexico.

387
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:52,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

388
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:55,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nogal Banjo Summers is not my real last name.

389
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:58,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we use mysterious last names on air so you can't stalk us.

390
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

391
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,522
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can tell a story as long as it has nothing to do with me being naked.

392
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,385
[SPEAKER_01]: She has to think.

393
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to think about that.

394
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I say what you used to call the beach area?

395
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:18,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

396
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,030
[SPEAKER_01]: The what?

397
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,011
[SPEAKER_01]: The beach?

398
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:23,011
[SPEAKER_01]: The beach area.

399
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:23,511
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

400
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:24,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Golf?

401
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:38,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to tell you, the new kids on the block are getting back together.

402
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom, mom, mom.

403
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,643
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one who bought me bed sheets and curtains, okay?

404
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:47,245
[SPEAKER_01]: The new kids on the block, everything.

405
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:49,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Bedspread, pillowcases, blankets.

406
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

407
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:54,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I've told you this myself, Rob.

408
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have forgot somehow.

409
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:57,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

410
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But you want to know what's awful?

411
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:00,687
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

412
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you laugh, I kill you.

413
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:03,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Slowly.

414
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:07,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as she got it all, she said, I don't like this anymore.

415
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:10,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

416
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:11,612
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

417
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:15,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And one time she had Michael Jackson poster over her bed.

418
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the one of him in the yellow sweater vest.

419
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:23,479
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow sweater vest that matched her bedroom because her bedroom was yellow and white.

420
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,279
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hardcore.

421
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have a picture of that one.

422
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,203
[SPEAKER_01]: You also put the Care Bears on my wall.

423
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:32,883
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not Care Bears.

424
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow Bright, right?

425
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:45,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Rainbow Bright.

426
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Rainbow Bright.

427
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:50,398
[SPEAKER_01]: You also had, what's that big-headed doll?

428
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:51,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Cabbage Patch.

429
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had Cabbage Patch dolls.

430
00:20:54,862 --> 00:21:03,189
[SPEAKER_01]: That I stood in line for several hours with every other dumb mother in the world getting a Cabbage Patch doll that you didn't like.

431
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked her.

432
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,312
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me the one with brown hair, right?

433
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:07,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

434
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:07,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

435
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked her because she was like, she was like me.

436
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:14,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I searched and searched for one that, you know, would be perfect for you.

437
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:18,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had Cadvics Patch bedroom shoes.

438
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:21,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember those?

439
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have.

440
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,533
[SPEAKER_06]: They were pink and they had the heads on them.

441
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:26,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

442
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:32,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you not picture Jamie walking around with cabbage-packed bedroom shoes on?

443
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:34,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I get to tell an embarrassing story about Matthew.

444
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:37,866
[SPEAKER_06]: How we used to dress him up in my doll dress with the bonnet.

445
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,788
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you used to dress him up.

446
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:41,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

447
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,312
[SPEAKER_01]: You used to dress him up like he was a big baby doll.

448
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:46,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it was great.

449
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:47,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got pictures.

450
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:52,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And we used to put Phillip in blue shorts and the red shirt and put my five-year-old hat on him.

451
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:55,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, yep.

452
00:21:56,229 --> 00:22:01,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to tell you, Mom, you're going to laugh and I had to do it just because I downloaded the New Kids on the Block single.

453
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:03,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You what now?

454
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:06,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded the New Kids on the Block single on iTunes.

455
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:08,714
[SPEAKER_06]: You jumbled it?

456
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Downloaded.

457
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:10,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, download.

458
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:12,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, you're kind of echoey.

459
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:13,636
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because we got microphones.

460
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:14,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Skype is weird.

461
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:19,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that we're using a program through the computer to call you.

462
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, don't forget to email or text your brother.

463
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:27,366
[SPEAKER_01]: and Happy Memorial Day.

464
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:31,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Since he served five years in our military.

465
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Mama, email me his phone number, okay?

466
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:36,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he changed his phone since I had it last.

467
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:38,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you got Matt one.

468
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:41,649
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I got Matt, I think.

469
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:43,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he doesn't have his anymore.

470
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

471
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Things change.

472
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,831
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Phillips and Huntsville?

473
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:47,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

474
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:50,193
[SPEAKER_06]: We're telling everybody our family history.

475
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can go to Huntsville and look for Phillip.

476
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:55,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't give his last name to protect the guilty.

477
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,738
[SPEAKER_01]: At Ruby Tuesdays.

478
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my brother is a waiter at Ruby Tuesdays.

479
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And a bartender.

480
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:03,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he's a bartender now.

481
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:05,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And a waiter.

482
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:05,924
[SPEAKER_06]: He does both.

483
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:07,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Mama, can I say bad language around you?

484
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:10,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had news before.

485
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:14,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I think at your age, which I'm not going to say.

486
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:21,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Find my brother, his name is Phillip, at a Ruby Tuesdays in Huntsville and order an Adios motherfucker and say his sister said so.

487
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, they're really nasty.

488
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Does everybody know that your brother was in the Marines?

489
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I have said so.

490
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:34,556
[SPEAKER_06]: My brother was in the Marines and I told the story about how he chased everybody out of his tent with his stinky feet.

491
00:23:35,476 --> 00:23:35,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

492
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:37,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes he did.

493
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,681
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his defense.

494
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:43,544
[SPEAKER_01]: If the bad guys ever came in there, he would just take his boots off.

495
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:44,905
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably worked.

496
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It might work, yeah.

497
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Phil had stinky feet when he was little, okay?

498
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:50,350
[SPEAKER_06]: He stank all the time, his feet did.

499
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a stink bomb.

500
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:57,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Mommy, Mother Deer, we have to let you go.

501
00:23:58,196 --> 00:23:58,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

502
00:23:58,897 --> 00:23:59,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have to eat cake.

503
00:23:59,838 --> 00:23:59,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Cake.

504
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:04,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, AK can have fun.

505
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:04,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Be happy.

506
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:06,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and email me Phillip's stuff.

507
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we could talk to you.

508
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:08,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

509
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you too.

510
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And the listeners love you.

511
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:12,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all have fun tomorrow.

512
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:13,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Do what?

513
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The listeners love you.

514
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in Alabama harass my brother.

515
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

516
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:20,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

517
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:20,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, Mom.

518
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:21,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

519
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:22,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you.

520
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:24,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you too.

521
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:27,963
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

522
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Mommy.

523
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:30,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

524
00:24:30,484 --> 00:24:33,905
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom now has her second appearance on the show.

525
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:35,265
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

526
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

527
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,105
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom's probably in bed.

528
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,486
[SPEAKER_03]: If I call her, we're getting smacked.

529
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:40,366
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get to the cage match, too, folks.

530
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:44,767
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to wrap up and get to the cage match.

531
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did I miss while I was gone, anyway?

532
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:50,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We hijacked the afterbirth and talked about comics.

533
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:50,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun.

534
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:51,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

535
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, song number one won two weeks ago.

536
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:57,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Diddy from a band called Ladytron.

537
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:00,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Ladytron, and apparently you do too, because you voted it the winner.

538
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:01,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, song number one.

539
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:04,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week's Cage Match winner was Ghosts.

540
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:05,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, you only get to hear a clip of it.

541
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you've got to be in chat to vote for your favorite.

542
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:14,280
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, just ask someone in chat how it works if you really don't know, because I don't feel like explaining it, because I'm going to go help with cake.

543
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:27,231
Thanks for watching!

544
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:12,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a ghost in me

545
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:37,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That was song number one, Lady Tron, with Ghost, the winner from the holdover from the May 11th show, last time we were here.

546
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:39,769
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into some new songs tonight.

547
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,450
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

548
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever Tiara picked.

549
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara, what did you pick for us tonight?

550
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:50,054
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my birthday, so we're going to listen to The Beatles' Birthday.

551
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:51,694
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, why not?

552
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,315
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of classic rock.

553
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:54,316
[SPEAKER_03]: The Beatles.

554
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I've been with Paul McCartney before.

555
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:58,299
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, we did have Paul McCartney before.

556
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:58,839
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

557
00:26:58,859 --> 00:26:59,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Some classic rock.

558
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,722
[SPEAKER_03]: The Beatles with Birthday.

559
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:01,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

560
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, a little bit of classic... Jamie, you just broke the can.

561
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,034
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of classic stuff, I'll fix it.

562
00:29:55,308 --> 00:30:01,489
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of classic rock with The Beatles and Birthday.

563
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,109
[SPEAKER_03]: You say it's your birthday.

564
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:03,869
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?

565
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,070
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you rank that song?

566
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,890
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with Tiara.

567
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,270
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just work our way around in a circle.

568
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara.

569
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It's The Beatles.

570
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:11,451
[SPEAKER_00]: It's White Album.

571
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:12,371
[SPEAKER_00]: It's classic rock.

572
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:14,831
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a 10.

573
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,352
[SPEAKER_03]: A 10 from Tiara, DarkSakura.

574
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:17,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets a 10.

575
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:19,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets Tiara's heads up.

576
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That song still holds up very well today.

577
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:22,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it an 8.5.

578
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:22,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew.

579
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a 10 because Tiara said so.

580
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I'm not buying into this whole Tiara says thing, so it gets an average 6 from me.

581
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:36,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, because it's an average song.

582
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, then what pray towel did you bring to the listening public today in song number 3?

583
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:43,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked a song by a group called Methods of Mayhem.

584
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:48,068
[SPEAKER_04]: You may not recognize this group, but it's actually Tommy Lee, um,

585
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: producing music that's unlike Tommy Lee, but it's a rock rap group, but trust me, the song's pretty good.

586
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:58,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So the song's called Crash.

587
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here it is.

588
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:04,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number three in the cage match, your last song tonight, Methods of Mayhem with Crash.

589
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy, or don't, you decide.

590
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:08,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Crash.

591
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:02,638
and all the rest.

592
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:45,452
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

593
00:33:41,289 --> 00:34:02,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss the ground We're going too fast, we're going too fast Ain't no way that it's me, we're never gonna last We're going too fast, we're going trash I took the risk, so what the hell did you expect?

594
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:36,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back to Orange Line Straight Outta the Cage Mesh.

595
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:38,884
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Methods of Mayhem with Crash.

596
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the things that go on in studio when you're not here.

597
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:42,825
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

598
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:44,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what you guys thought of that.

599
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:47,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that song mayhem, or did you just want to crash it apart?

600
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:47,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

601
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:48,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara.

602
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:51,407
[SPEAKER_00]: This song is going nowhere.

603
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:52,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it a six.

604
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:54,325
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

605
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:56,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like it.

606
00:34:56,046 --> 00:34:56,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seven and a half.

607
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,968
[SPEAKER_11]: The bass drum was awesome.

608
00:34:59,148 --> 00:34:59,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Eight.

609
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:00,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Drew.

610
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give it a five.

611
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:05,552
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

612
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's far from what you were saying, Loki.

613
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:09,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine.

614
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:10,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine.

615
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:10,835
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

616
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:11,696
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

617
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:13,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine is in the number nine.

618
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:14,518
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

619
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:17,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's recap the song so you can vote for it tonight.

620

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

629
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:11,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, we will get to the FUs of the week, which I hope have already started to come in because we've had to fill enough time tonight.

630
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I've got one arrive already Um, I've got one

631
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,548
[SPEAKER_03]: More will probably come in as you start to read the one.

632
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:36,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Osfer says F you to Skye for missing his time limit, but then again it doesn't matter because it was fun while he was gone.

633
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:38,017
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you trying to say?

634
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:39,499
[SPEAKER_03]: This show's more fun without me here?

635
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I freaking adore Osfer, okay?

636
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Osfer is, like, rad.

637
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:47,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Ossifer is great.

638
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:49,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Ossifer is great.

639
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:54,174
[SPEAKER_06]: But it better be in a nice way that you love my mommy.

640
00:36:54,194 --> 00:36:55,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my mommy too.

641
00:36:56,057 --> 00:37:01,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, F you to people who missed out on the debauchery of my 30th last night.

642
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:02,304
[SPEAKER_06]: You poor bastards.

643
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that would be us.

644
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:04,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed out.

645
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:10,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that should be amended to those who are in a position to attend, yet did not.

646
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:13,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I hereby void Ranma's FU, Nolan Void.

647
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I amend it, but with another proposal.

648
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:18,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone four, aye.

649
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:20,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

650
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:22,330
[SPEAKER_06]: No amending.

651
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fine, I don't care.

652
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:27,694
[SPEAKER_06]: As you two rods may.

653
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,116
[SPEAKER_06]: By power of estrogen.

654
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Sim are FUs.

655
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, I made it.

656
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:41,878
[SPEAKER_06]: More FUs, not more breaking of my computer.

657
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,379
[SPEAKER_06]: FUs.

658
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:45,060
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to these forks.

659
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheeseburger.

660
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:48,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Fork you.

661
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you know what?

662
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:58,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, if you keep, okay, he says FU to me not reading an email that he sent six weeks ago, and I'm telling you this, it's gone, like I told you last time, like I told you earlier today.

663
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:02,231
[SPEAKER_06]: The email you sent six weeks ago is gone.

664
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:08,750
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want an email read, send another email.

665
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see.

666
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:11,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see.

667
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:15,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I skipped a lot of emails, okay?

668
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:23,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I passed yours up once or twice or three times does not mean that I hate you.

669
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:27,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have time to read it.

670
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:33,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie is the goddamn Batman.

671
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And she hates chocolate.

672
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:36,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I am the goddamn Batman.

673
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:37,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I like chocolate.

674
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:39,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I am the goddamn chocolate Batman.

675
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:47,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone save Rob saying that, please.

676
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:52,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone's running a recording right now.

677
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:53,458
[SPEAKER_03]: You're screwed.

678
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:57,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, Shut up.

679
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, F you to not having money.

680
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,442
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, your mom rocks.

681
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:02,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

682
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,943
[SPEAKER_06]: She rocks me a lot more now that I've grown up.

683
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:14,798
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was growing up, though, my mom always used to be like, You get back here in your room, and you get it clean, and I'll take your TV away!

684
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,559
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind went straight to the gutter, too.

685
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,100
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind is the gutter.

686
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like, Mama, you can't take my TV away because Daddy got that for me, and you taking it would be theft.

687
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:23,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a brat.

688
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:31,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So to have my mom be as cool as she is now with me being such an ungrateful little brat, my mom is super awesome.

689
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:43,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, I don't think you can really let your mind go to the gutter about Jamie's mom being a screamer when you just told everybody you're the chocolate Batman.

690
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Touche.

691
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:52,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Tyrell says F you to DK Bungos that waste... Ah, fuck, someone's recording.

692
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:53,295
Fuck.

693
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:58,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if you've got the whole conversation with my mom, save it for me.

694
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:00,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll give you my email address later.

695
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:03,855
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, according to Ossifer, this is seriously the best afterbirth ever.

696
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,576
[SPEAKER_02]: This is long, it's going on forever.

697
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:07,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So busted right?

698
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:11,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Tyrol says, F you to DK Bungos that waste space on my shelf and attract spiders.

699
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:15,504
[SPEAKER_10]: You are the best.

700
00:40:15,524 --> 00:40:17,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Sauce is the best guest ever.

701
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:21,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Roboboy430 says, F you to Voldemort.

702
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,222
[SPEAKER_06]: The males are having a huddle.

703
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:37,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, it's not about you.

704
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:40,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is being the chocolate Batman.

705
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:46,530
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly is the chocolate Batman?

706
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.

707
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:47,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

708
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,672
[SPEAKER_06]: You said that's you, so why don't you tell us?

709
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:50,132
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

710
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:51,433
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

711
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill the music.

712
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: These FUs are over.

713
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:55,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop!

714
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,156
[SPEAKER_06]: No more FUs.

715
00:40:56,476 --> 00:40:56,737
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

716
00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:58,657
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a cage match wiener?

717
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody weaned the cage match tonight.

718
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the cage match wiener.

719
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:04,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a babe in a tit?

720
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,560
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

721
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

722
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cage match winner is actually a close vote tonight between all three songs.

723
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:10,341
[SPEAKER_10]: What, what?

724
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Bass drum.

725
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:16,824
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

726
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:23,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe doing Grover impressions on Justin TV for some weird reason.

727
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are finally ready to put the nail in the coffin of this damn show.

728
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

729
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:31,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

730
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:34,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now 1am on the East Coast.

731
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:36,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

732
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:43,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, YouTube has been so slow on my computer lately, but of course everybody has been leeching bandwidth, so that's what happens.

733
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,930
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright, it'll finish before we're done.

734
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

735
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:51,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody have to say anything before we turn it back over to All Games?

736
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:52,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Cake.

737
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a very important announcement.

738
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:56,574
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

739
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:02,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, really like cake.

740
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

741
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:09,978
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to the fortune cookie message of the day now, as chosen by Drew because he felt it was appropriate tonight.

742
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:12,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you hate this fortune cookie message, what's your email?

743
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:14,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Classified.

744
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:16,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I'll find it for you and give it to you.

745
00:42:16,885 --> 00:42:18,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, fortune cookie message of the day.

746
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:35,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a Percival, I'm teaching you.

747
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a Pokémon, I'm geeking too.

748
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:43,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Mario and Peach, I'm never teaching you.

749
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:48,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Gundam, Siege, you're my destiny.

750
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Ed, I've lost you from your alchemy.

751
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:56,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I get a lightning kick from you, just like Chun-Li.

752
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:28,765
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the only one for me Try so hard to make me see You're the only one for me Priceless like a penis ring You're the only one for me Do it now, pretend you'll be What you'd ever be Now level 17

753
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

754
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,507
Music Music Music Music

755
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:23,224
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the only one for me, tried so hard to make you see You're the only one for me, Christ was left, he has been Even for me, you and I, the angels, we will together be

756
00:45:25,948 --> 00:45:41,723
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the only one for me I've tried so hard to make you see You're the only one for me Priceless like a PS3 You're the only one for me You and I intend only to never be All of the same

757
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:58,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.

758
00:45:58,885 --> 00:45:59,845
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very cute.

759
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:00,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Ranma.

760
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:01,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually liked that.

761
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:02,528
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't bad.

762
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:03,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cutely good.

763
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:05,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to watch it when I'm at an angle that I can see it.

764
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,732
[SPEAKER_03]: This, by the way, was the Leet Street Boys.

765
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:10,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cute.

766
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:10,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I approve.

767
00:46:11,574 --> 00:46:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.
