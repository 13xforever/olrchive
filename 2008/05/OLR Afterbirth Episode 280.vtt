WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
By the way, this is part of the show. It's too hot to podcast blah blah blah low-key has brought another edition of

00:05.880 --> 00:07.880
Secret club tonight

00:08.120 --> 00:12.440
For those of you who don't know what secret club is secret club is where we're going to tell you some secrets

00:12.640 --> 00:16.040
About things that will be happening in the game industry very soon however

00:16.040 --> 00:21.680
There is a rule that goes with secret club and that is that you don't talk about secret club in other words

00:21.680 --> 00:23.680
You're going to hear some things on here

00:23.720 --> 00:29.680
You don't say you heard him here because we've gotten in trouble over stuff before and we just don't care to have the limelight

00:29.680 --> 00:34.740
Anymore, it's really not that important to us so that being said secret club rules one

00:34.740 --> 00:40.280
It's just it's you know really juicy stuff that you got to tell somebody so I know a lot of people were disappointed with

00:41.020 --> 00:47.440
Capcom not porting over resident evil zero over here only Japan's getting it and you know everyone liked resident evil

00:47.840 --> 00:53.600
For we and stuff well they are porting a game over. It's not resident evil though. It's

00:54.520 --> 00:57.780
Another game also happens to have dead things running around

00:57.780 --> 00:59.780
in

00:59.900 --> 01:01.420
January

01:01.420 --> 01:06.740
Dead rising coming through the wii yay, so that would be pretty cool. That could be interesting

01:07.940 --> 01:15.980
Also, they have a pretty strong lineup for the winner so far one that's been delayed bionic commando as actually now set in

01:16.300 --> 01:17.300
February

01:17.300 --> 01:23.180
Hopefully that sticks resident evil 5 in March and Street Fighter 4 in January

01:23.180 --> 01:29.740
Of course the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360

01:29.860 --> 01:35.860
That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4 January. Yeah, well. There's another I read another story though

01:36.420 --> 01:42.420
From juice France those in the same thing. They said a winner release for it, so it fits so all right

01:43.940 --> 01:47.620
It's a good spot to put it. I mean cuz there's nothing comes out in January. That's it

01:47.620 --> 01:52.700
All right, we're gonna do something very special now, and I'm gonna leave I'm leaving

01:53.220 --> 01:58.140
I'm running to the store because we're gonna do cake and I need to get some plates and some forks and all that good stuff

01:58.140 --> 02:04.260
And I need some other stuff myself so this store happens to be just down the street and around the corner

02:04.260 --> 02:09.380
So I should be back in no more than 10 minutes, so you guys gonna. Time me how long I'm gone

02:10.180 --> 02:12.180
We have exactly 10 minutes to run

02:12.180 --> 02:18.380
Showing time you guys are gonna run the show talk about whatever you want fill time

02:18.780 --> 02:22.540

02:23.300 --> 02:25.860

Is this the race in my mind? Okay, so somebody's got to say on your mark get set go okay ready?

02:34.540 --> 02:36.900
He's gonna get in a car accident die

02:36.900 --> 02:42.700
That's games timer is running. Maybe we'll be able to do a show next week cuz he'll be dead

02:42.700 --> 02:45.660
I don't want to sit in Rob's chair, but I want to fuck up his computer

02:49.020 --> 02:51.020
Can't hear you the windows closed

02:51.020 --> 03:03.540
Uh-huh, that's Rob's alarm that doesn't do any good. He's running

03:06.700 --> 03:12.020
Don't understand why why does he not have plates that's what I said, that's not what I said like I

03:12.980 --> 03:14.980
offered to wash

03:15.220 --> 03:17.220
the plates

03:17.220 --> 03:22.660
I'm gonna go buy some so that my cosplayer has some pretty awesome cleavage

03:24.140 --> 03:29.700
You've gotta have those did Rob say part B. I don't know

03:31.860 --> 03:34.120
Let's close the computer down yes

03:36.180 --> 03:38.600
Whoa shit my mic was off. I was

03:38.600 --> 03:47.080
I can't be a host rather than Mike. Oh no. Oscar told me to say boob ten times, so I'm gonna say it ready boob ten times on air XD

03:48.080 --> 03:50.240
Har-har-har, this was said

03:53.040 --> 03:56.560
You know I need to add a thread for a thread with auto in

03:57.360 --> 04:00.200
The ole army thing I've been playing a few people

04:00.200 --> 04:03.760
It's been fun, but most of the time I get invited to games and no one knows who I am

04:03.760 --> 04:10.920
So just a reminder for all our army people I believe there is a group for steam

04:10.920 --> 04:16.800
I believe there's also is a clan on X fire might want to join it true because it's getting kind of lonely

04:17.240 --> 04:19.240
Pass the mic over

04:20.160 --> 04:22.160
Pass the mic over

04:23.160 --> 04:26.480
You may like it, but women have precedents because we have boobs

04:26.480 --> 04:36.440
Awesome, you know what I'm gonna. Do I'm gonna go to the bathroom a game. Thanks. We are hijacking the afterbirth officially

04:38.440 --> 04:41.080
Oh my god always does this

04:41.080 --> 04:44.600
Okay, okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on

04:54.920 --> 04:56.920
And this is what happens when women run show

05:00.280 --> 05:06.760
We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics we hate the scrolls

05:07.880 --> 05:09.880
they suck so bad and

05:09.880 --> 05:11.880
um and they suck

05:12.120 --> 05:16.760
They do suck and they turn green well. They are green, but they turn into other people

05:18.120 --> 05:23.360
And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a scroll for all we know half the chat room could be scrolled

05:24.800 --> 05:30.120
Andrew could be a scroll, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green. I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me

05:30.120 --> 05:40.800
The show makes me turn green. Scroll!

05:40.800 --> 05:47.680
Okay, act death protests and toshin protests and a bunch of people said that they're not scroll so that means they are

05:48.680 --> 05:50.680
You just want us to

05:50.680 --> 05:52.680
If you say you aren't a scroll, you are a scroll

05:52.680 --> 05:54.680
Do they weigh less than a duck?

05:56.080 --> 05:58.080
I mean we can find out

05:58.080 --> 06:01.000
And don't eat us cuz you can't become us

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
Wait different universe. Sorry

06:06.000 --> 06:09.120
And cheeseburger if you have to ask it means you are one

06:12.480 --> 06:17.680
Yes, the Hulk does turn green actually the Hulk turns gray and red and

06:17.680 --> 06:26.720
He in one universe he eats people's brains damn the Patriots and poops them out I

06:28.920 --> 06:31.480
Just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to save his poo

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Because it had alien matter. No no it had alien rubber bands in it

06:37.680 --> 06:41.720
You know not what you just what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom I

06:41.720 --> 06:47.520
I keep comics in my bathroom everybody just die monster. You don't belong in this world

06:48.240 --> 06:52.520
I do okay the comics in my bathroom right now is that three volumes of the ultimates I?

06:53.520 --> 06:55.660
Have I'm sorry one

06:56.520 --> 07:01.400
And I know it's why exiles cuz it's awesome, and you suck. Why God why?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.360
Can I kill him ultimate volume one and two

07:05.920 --> 07:09.440
You're actually not supposed to like it supposedly if you like Marvel

07:09.440 --> 07:15.360
But it's actually better written than the actual Avengers ha ha ha I said it see how easily provoked Jamie is I?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.320
Actually have nothing against the ultimate series I

07:19.200 --> 07:21.640
Have everything against you though, so it's okay. I

07:22.280 --> 07:24.280
Know I know

07:24.680 --> 07:32.120
So if you're into comics if you were into the Iron Man movie there is a new invincible Iron Man series that came out

07:32.560 --> 07:36.400
Not this last week, but the week before you'll probably be able to find it in

07:36.400 --> 07:41.640
Your local comic book store. It's a good starting point for people who have

07:42.280 --> 07:46.820
Seen the movie and want to learn more about Iron Man, but have never read any of the comics

07:47.720 --> 07:49.720
the main villain so far is

07:50.240 --> 07:56.280
Jebediah stain who is the son of Obadiah stain the main villain from the Iron Man movie you'll see

07:57.440 --> 08:04.600
And you'll see roadie, and it's it's a very good comic a good writer good artist well

08:04.600 --> 08:11.080
Yeah, okay artist. I'm not too happy with art, but overall a good recommendation for a comic

08:11.440 --> 08:14.440
Rob has now been gone for five minutes and 45 seconds

08:17.640 --> 08:19.640
Five minutes have elapsed

08:23.720 --> 08:27.900
Another good comic this week was x-men divided we stand number two

08:27.900 --> 08:35.580
Which is one of the Messiah complex comics dealing with the x-men featuring?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
That's what you were reading earlier

08:39.740 --> 08:45.260
I have downloaded it and have yet to read it because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill

08:45.900 --> 08:47.900
Series that I'm waiting on to be finished

08:49.420 --> 08:53.180
My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a

08:53.180 --> 08:58.780
A contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill

09:00.900 --> 09:08.060
Happens I want to go to the best place ever you want to run off to Silent Hill. You'll have a killer good time

09:10.580 --> 09:13.020
Herman Herman head goes fast for tonight

09:15.220 --> 09:17.220
No

09:17.220 --> 09:19.220
He has to drag around that great knife

09:19.220 --> 09:21.220
So how was Mighty Avengers

09:21.380 --> 09:26.700
Mighty Avengers is very interesting because it's fantastic wasn't it it was more scroll tastic

09:26.700 --> 09:30.180
But it was more or less Bob is nuts the comic. Yeah

09:30.820 --> 09:32.740
basically

09:32.740 --> 09:37.700
another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe is the

09:39.180 --> 09:41.180
Captain Marvel short series

09:42.020 --> 09:47.980
Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many many years ago, but they brought him back

09:47.980 --> 09:53.340
And I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing

09:53.340 --> 09:56.740
But the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good

09:56.740 --> 10:00.920
And it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback

10:03.180 --> 10:06.660
I've been told to say something. I can't normally say around Rob. Okay, I

10:08.420 --> 10:12.420
Don't say whatever the fuck I want around Rob so maybe um

10:14.420 --> 10:16.420
What's something that really grosses Rob out

10:16.420 --> 10:18.420
kind of ritual sex

10:21.580 --> 10:23.620
There I said it he likes boobies

10:24.980 --> 10:30.460
All men like boobies. It doesn't matter if they're gay. Yeah, I remember one time at Disneyland

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
What

10:38.740 --> 10:40.740
He only sucks if you pay him

10:40.740 --> 10:45.740
Only if you're female, sorry lalalala lalala lalalala lalalalala

10:46.980 --> 10:54.020
Lali lu they know I suggested that I say vagina I can say that around Rob though. We saw Margaret Cho. Hi

10:57.020 --> 11:03.020
This is a woman who's part of her stand-up comedy was about her period so no that doesn't work I

11:03.020 --> 11:09.900
I like what she said though. She said that if Richard Pryor had a period he would talk about it. How do you guy?

11:10.440 --> 11:11.900
now

11:11.900 --> 11:15.400
Well, you're not housing a hottie. How do you guy why not?

11:16.200 --> 11:22.700
Because I'm sitting down you should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can

11:23.280 --> 11:25.280
stop

11:25.280 --> 11:34.240
Oh, yes, I know what Rob doesn't like Rob doesn't like looking at girls butts

11:36.920 --> 11:43.080
He likes that song right yes nine minutes have elapsed

11:45.140 --> 11:52.080
You know what Rob lied to us he lied to me he's never coming back

11:52.080 --> 11:56.020
Probably right and he probably got into a car accident. The cake is a lie

11:57.000 --> 12:01.400
Given that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store

12:01.840 --> 12:04.980
And then you have to go in and get plates, and then you have to pay for plates

12:05.040 --> 12:09.080
You know what we should do we should go to grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake

12:09.960 --> 12:15.080
And go I guess guess what Rob you know that bet he's doing what he's buying a present

12:17.400 --> 12:20.160
He's getting you a Walmart gift card

12:20.160 --> 12:26.720
I should've told him to buy candles, and then you could all sing me happy birthday, and I could I'm doing it right now nine eight

12:28.040 --> 12:31.960
seven six five four three

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
two one

12:35.200 --> 12:36.420
time

12:36.420 --> 12:41.480
My mommy just texted it at me. What'd your mom have to say happy Memorial Day tomorrow?

12:42.240 --> 12:45.880
I'm saying thanks mommy. Happy my birthday weekend

12:46.760 --> 12:48.000
and

12:48.000 --> 12:50.560
Happy DJ Ranma s birthday weekend

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
time

12:53.200 --> 13:00.920
And happy Lenny Kravitz birthday weekend even though. I'm not really into any of his music Rob you're late

13:00.920 --> 13:14.560
Train wreck-a-rama we has Rex Metal Gear

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
So I told Rob to get candles I

13:24.760 --> 13:26.760
Told Rob to get bent

13:26.760 --> 13:32.760
There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called love

13:33.400 --> 13:40.080
It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid the love of a staunch true man the love of a baby unafraid have

13:40.640 --> 13:47.360
Existed since time began, but the greatest of loves the quintessence of loves even greater than that of a mother

13:47.360 --> 13:52.120
It's the tender passionate infinite love of one drunken marine for another

13:52.120 --> 13:58.760
That's fantastic Rob is late late late late. Rob is late late late late

14:00.720 --> 14:02.720
25 seconds

14:06.200 --> 14:11.600
You're a butt fire you Rob I could we could have used the dishes

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
And I would have loaded the dishwasher

14:15.200 --> 14:23.320
But then you would have had to been here to like clean the dishes. I got some pretzels and chips for me and look

14:23.840 --> 14:26.520
Triscuits redesigned their package isn't that something?

14:31.360 --> 14:33.360
So what did I miss?

14:35.280 --> 14:40.280
Rob you missed the hurricane it came in it rocked us like a hurricane and then left

14:41.160 --> 14:42.440
Yes

14:42.440 --> 14:45.440
Thank you for the scorpions reference any

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
Time

14:52.360 --> 14:59.720
I want to know what the hell my mom is doing up at 1130. She doesn't have to work tomorrow Rob. It's a holiday my mother

15:01.640 --> 15:03.640

15:14.240 --> 15:16.240
Better than a drunk show

15:26.440 --> 15:31.560

I thought it was sunny all the time in California. No, that's only on movie sets

16:46.560 --> 16:48.560

17:44.760 --> 17:49.240
Woman, I've said I told this story online before I'm just glad you didn't name me Erica

17:49.240 --> 17:51.040

30:14.820 --> 30:18.820
A 10 from T-ara, Dark Soccer. It gets a 10 because T-ara said so.

30:19.300 --> 30:23.140
That song still holds up very well today. I give it a eight and a half

30:23.980 --> 30:26.860

30:50.680 --> 30:56.580
Producing music that unlike Tommy Lee, but it's a rock rap group, but trust me the song is pretty good

37:10.440 --> 37:24.440
I hereby Boyd Rama's that you don't look good. Actually, I am amended but with another proposal to do everyone for I know I'm in

38:18.080 --> 38:20.080

38:20.520 --> 38:23.120
Does not mean that I hate you

38:23.120 --> 38:25.120
I

38:26.360 --> 38:28.360
Had to read it

39:01.060 --> 39:06.140
A lot more now than for us when I was growing up

39:14.420 --> 39:17.940
My mind went straight to the gutter to my mind is the gutter

39:18.180 --> 39:23.780
Mommy, you can't take my TV away cuz daddy got that for me and you taking it would be best. I was a brat

39:24.620 --> 39:29.140
So to have my mom be as cool as she is now with me being such an ungrateful little brat

39:29.140 --> 39:31.140
My mom is super awesome

39:31.940 --> 39:36.980
Rob I don't think you can really let your mind go to the gutter about Timmy's mom being a screamer

39:36.980 --> 39:52.260
Oh fuck someone's recording

40:00.260 --> 40:05.340
By the way, according to Oscar, this is seriously the best afterbirth ever long it's going on forever

40:05.340 --> 40:11.340
This is so busted. Tyrol says eff you to decay bongos that waste space on my shelf and attract spiders

40:15.180 --> 40:21.180
Sauce is the best guest ever. Rebo boy for three sisters eff you to Voldemort

40:21.180 --> 40:31.180

40:35.780 --> 40:37.780
Believe it or not. It's not about you

40:43.980 --> 40:50.140
What exactly is the chocolate Batman I don't know you said that's you so why don't you tell us all right

40:50.140 --> 40:52.100

41:00.420 --> 41:03.880
Somebody weaned the cage match tonight. It's like a baby

41:04.940 --> 41:06.500

41:06.500 --> 41:09.580

41:14.820 --> 41:16.820

41:23.980 --> 41:27.300
We are finally ready to put the nail in the coffin of this damn show. Yeah

41:30.700 --> 41:33.900
All right, it's now 1 a.m. On the East Coast

41:35.900 --> 41:39.860
All right, I know the YouTube has been so slow on my computer lately

41:39.860 --> 41:44.140
But of course everybody has been like leeching bandwidth. So that's what happens. That's right

41:44.140 --> 41:48.420
It'll it'll finish before we're done. So that's gonna do it for tonight's orange launch radio

That was cute. I approve good times. All right

46:13.060 --> 46:19.580
We are officially pulling the plug on orange launch radio tonight and we're gonna be turning it over to all games radio

46:19.580 --> 46:23.320
Of course the lovely radio station that hosts our show on Sunday night

46:23.320 --> 46:27.980
We appreciate it the next live program on all games radio will be all games interactive

46:27.980 --> 46:34.200
I'm actually not sure if they're live tomorrow though, but I'll just assume they are their show is on at noon now

46:34.200 --> 46:37.020
They've moved to noon. So that's three o'clock Eastern

46:37.020 --> 46:42.860
So stay tuned for all games interactive and in the meantime, you're 24. Oh, yeah, we do anything on just TV

46:43.780 --> 46:48.240
