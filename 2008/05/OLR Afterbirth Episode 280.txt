By the way, this is part of the show. It's too hot to podcast blah blah blah low-key has brought another edition of
Secret club tonight
For those of you who don't know what secret club is secret club is where we're going to tell you some secrets
About things that will be happening in the game industry very soon however
There is a rule that goes with secret club and that is that you don't talk about secret club in other words
You're going to hear some things on here
You don't say you heard him here because we've gotten in trouble over stuff before and we just don't care to have the limelight
Anymore, it's really not that important to us so that being said secret club rules one
It's just it's you know really juicy stuff that you got to tell somebody so I know a lot of people were disappointed with
Capcom not porting over resident evil zero over here only Japan's getting it and you know everyone liked resident evil
For we and stuff well they are porting a game over. It's not resident evil though. It's
Another game also happens to have dead things running around
in
January
Dead rising coming through the wii yay, so that would be pretty cool. That could be interesting
Also, they have a pretty strong lineup for the winner so far one that's been delayed bionic commando as actually now set in
February
Hopefully that sticks resident evil 5 in March and Street Fighter 4 in January
Of course the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360
That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4 January. Yeah, well. There's another I read another story though
From juice France those in the same thing. They said a winner release for it, so it fits so all right
It's a good spot to put it. I mean cuz there's nothing comes out in January. That's it
All right, we're gonna do something very special now, and I'm gonna leave I'm leaving
I'm running to the store because we're gonna do cake and I need to get some plates and some forks and all that good stuff
And I need some other stuff myself so this store happens to be just down the street and around the corner
So I should be back in no more than 10 minutes, so you guys gonna. Time me how long I'm gone
We have exactly 10 minutes to run
Showing time you guys are gonna run the show talk about whatever you want fill time
interact with chatters take off your top for Justin TV who cares
Have fun. I'll flash my cleavage all right, so you
Is this the race in my mind? Okay, so somebody's got to say on your mark get set go okay ready?
He's gonna get in a car accident die
That's games timer is running. Maybe we'll be able to do a show next week cuz he'll be dead
I don't want to sit in Rob's chair, but I want to fuck up his computer
Can't hear you the windows closed
Uh-huh, that's Rob's alarm that doesn't do any good. He's running
Don't understand why why does he not have plates that's what I said, that's not what I said like I
offered to wash
the plates
I'm gonna go buy some so that my cosplayer has some pretty awesome cleavage
You've gotta have those did Rob say part B. I don't know
Let's close the computer down yes
Whoa shit my mic was off. I was
I can't be a host rather than Mike. Oh no. Oscar told me to say boob ten times, so I'm gonna say it ready boob ten times on air XD
Har-har-har, this was said
You know I need to add a thread for a thread with auto in
The ole army thing I've been playing a few people
It's been fun, but most of the time I get invited to games and no one knows who I am
So just a reminder for all our army people I believe there is a group for steam
I believe there's also is a clan on X fire might want to join it true because it's getting kind of lonely
Pass the mic over
Pass the mic over
You may like it, but women have precedents because we have boobs
Awesome, you know what I'm gonna. Do I'm gonna go to the bathroom a game. Thanks. We are hijacking the afterbirth officially
Oh my god always does this
Okay, okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on
And this is what happens when women run show
We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics we hate the scrolls
they suck so bad and
um and they suck
They do suck and they turn green well. They are green, but they turn into other people
And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a scroll for all we know half the chat room could be scrolled
Andrew could be a scroll, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green. I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me
The show makes me turn green. Scroll!
Okay, act death protests and toshin protests and a bunch of people said that they're not scroll so that means they are
You just want us to
If you say you aren't a scroll, you are a scroll
Do they weigh less than a duck?
I mean we can find out
And don't eat us cuz you can't become us
Wait different universe. Sorry
And cheeseburger if you have to ask it means you are one
Yes, the Hulk does turn green actually the Hulk turns gray and red and
He in one universe he eats people's brains damn the Patriots and poops them out I
Just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to save his poo
Because it had alien matter. No no it had alien rubber bands in it
You know not what you just what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom I
I keep comics in my bathroom everybody just die monster. You don't belong in this world
I do okay the comics in my bathroom right now is that three volumes of the ultimates I?
Have I'm sorry one
And I know it's why exiles cuz it's awesome, and you suck. Why God why?
Can I kill him ultimate volume one and two
You're actually not supposed to like it supposedly if you like Marvel
But it's actually better written than the actual Avengers ha ha ha I said it see how easily provoked Jamie is I?
Actually have nothing against the ultimate series I
Have everything against you though, so it's okay. I
Know I know
So if you're into comics if you were into the Iron Man movie there is a new invincible Iron Man series that came out
Not this last week, but the week before you'll probably be able to find it in
Your local comic book store. It's a good starting point for people who have
Seen the movie and want to learn more about Iron Man, but have never read any of the comics
the main villain so far is
Jebediah stain who is the son of Obadiah stain the main villain from the Iron Man movie you'll see
And you'll see roadie, and it's it's a very good comic a good writer good artist well
Yeah, okay artist. I'm not too happy with art, but overall a good recommendation for a comic
Rob has now been gone for five minutes and 45 seconds
Five minutes have elapsed
Another good comic this week was x-men divided we stand number two
Which is one of the Messiah complex comics dealing with the x-men featuring?
That's what you were reading earlier
I have downloaded it and have yet to read it because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill
Series that I'm waiting on to be finished
My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a
A contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill
Happens I want to go to the best place ever you want to run off to Silent Hill. You'll have a killer good time
Herman Herman head goes fast for tonight
No
He has to drag around that great knife
So how was Mighty Avengers
Mighty Avengers is very interesting because it's fantastic wasn't it it was more scroll tastic
But it was more or less Bob is nuts the comic. Yeah
basically
another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe is the
Captain Marvel short series
Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many many years ago, but they brought him back
And I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing
But the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good
And it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback
I've been told to say something. I can't normally say around Rob. Okay, I
Don't say whatever the fuck I want around Rob so maybe um
What's something that really grosses Rob out
kind of ritual sex
There I said it he likes boobies
All men like boobies. It doesn't matter if they're gay. Yeah, I remember one time at Disneyland
What
He only sucks if you pay him
Only if you're female, sorry lalalala lalala lalalala lalalalala
Lali lu they know I suggested that I say vagina I can say that around Rob though. We saw Margaret Cho. Hi
This is a woman who's part of her stand-up comedy was about her period so no that doesn't work I
I like what she said though. She said that if Richard Pryor had a period he would talk about it. How do you guy?
now
Well, you're not housing a hottie. How do you guy why not?
Because I'm sitting down you should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can
stop
Oh, yes, I know what Rob doesn't like Rob doesn't like looking at girls butts
He likes that song right yes nine minutes have elapsed
You know what Rob lied to us he lied to me he's never coming back
Probably right and he probably got into a car accident. The cake is a lie
Given that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store
And then you have to go in and get plates, and then you have to pay for plates
You know what we should do we should go to grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake
And go I guess guess what Rob you know that bet he's doing what he's buying a present
He's getting you a Walmart gift card
I should've told him to buy candles, and then you could all sing me happy birthday, and I could I'm doing it right now nine eight
seven six five four three
two one
time
My mommy just texted it at me. What'd your mom have to say happy Memorial Day tomorrow?
I'm saying thanks mommy. Happy my birthday weekend
and
Happy DJ Ranma s birthday weekend
time
And happy Lenny Kravitz birthday weekend even though. I'm not really into any of his music Rob you're late
Train wreck-a-rama we has Rex Metal Gear
So I told Rob to get candles I
Told Rob to get bent
There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called love
It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid the love of a staunch true man the love of a baby unafraid have
Existed since time began, but the greatest of loves the quintessence of loves even greater than that of a mother
It's the tender passionate infinite love of one drunken marine for another
That's fantastic Rob is late late late late. Rob is late late late late
25 seconds
You're a butt fire you Rob I could we could have used the dishes
And I would have loaded the dishwasher
But then you would have had to been here to like clean the dishes. I got some pretzels and chips for me and look
Triscuits redesigned their package isn't that something?
So what did I miss?
Rob you missed the hurricane it came in it rocked us like a hurricane and then left
Yes
