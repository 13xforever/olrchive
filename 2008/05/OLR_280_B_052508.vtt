00:14.960 --> 00:18.960
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.620 --> 00:25.720
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. For this part B of our podcast, it is Sunday, May 25th, 2008.

00:25.720 --> 00:30.120
Happy Memorial Day to those of you guys in the States who are celebrating Memorial Day tomorrow.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.120
Hooray for three-day weekend.

00:32.280 --> 00:39.900
You know, three-day weekends in the OLR world usually mean that we're gonna get drunk for Sunday nights, but not this year.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.240
It's kind of, well, it's kind of a downer. Why not?

00:43.240 --> 00:46.720
Well, Loki had to drive here and of course, you're not gonna drink and drive. That's not okay.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.400
And Dark Soccer, you know, she's entertaining companies, so she doesn't want to be passed out while company is here.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.940
And me, I'm not, I'm not allowed to drink medically right now because of everything I have with my pancreas.

00:56.940 --> 01:00.900
I might have to stay away from alcohol for a long time. So, but that's okay.

01:01.860 --> 01:07.700
You know, you don't need alcohol. You know, alcohol's fun when done responsibly, but you don't need it.

01:07.820 --> 01:14.280
So, I'll live. But I do need Olive Garden, so I hope I can eat, you know, something besides vegetables again soon.

01:14.780 --> 01:15.820
We'll see.

01:15.820 --> 01:18.300
Those of you playing the drinking game at home, take a shot.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.300
Why? Why do they, why do they take a shot?

01:20.300 --> 01:21.300
Olive Garden.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.100
All right.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.940
Anyhow, we're gonna get back into the gaming news here on Part B.

01:25.940 --> 01:29.660
If you missed Part A, you should go back in the podcast feed and listen to it.

01:29.660 --> 01:32.420
Unless you're listening live on Sunday, then unless you can rewind time,

01:32.420 --> 01:35.700
you're just gonna have to wait for Part A to hit the podcast feed, which should happen soon.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.300
But in the meantime, We News, Loki.

01:39.300 --> 01:47.700
Yes, we didn't get this game over here, but they had a music game in Japan that translated to Band Brothers.

01:47.700 --> 01:57.300
And also in Japan, they will be getting a brand new sequel to that game, which is entitled Band Brothers DX.

01:57.300 --> 02:05.700
And it will allow players to stream their best performances to their Wii for output through TV speakers, stereos, and home theater systems.

02:05.700 --> 02:12.100
And to accompany this, the Wii is getting a new channel called the Speaker Channel,

02:12.100 --> 02:18.100
which will allow you to do such, you know, things as that.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.100
So, that's pretty interesting.

02:20.100 --> 02:30.100
And also, I guess it's, the Band Brothers game, the original one is due out for the US as well, called Jam with the Band.

02:30.100 --> 02:35.100
Or at least it was, but now don't know if that's still coming out.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.100
What if I don't want to jam with the band?

02:37.100 --> 02:39.100
Then you don't play this game.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.100
What if I want to dance with myself?

02:40.100 --> 02:42.100
But thou must.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.100
I don't know.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.100
So, it looks neat, I guess.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.100
It sounds interesting.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.100
Do you think it's something we might ever get here in the States?

02:50.100 --> 02:52.100
Yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.100
Nintendo likes releasing stuff here.

02:54.100 --> 03:00.100
We didn't get the TV Guide channel, but granted, there's a whole nother reason for that.

03:00.100 --> 03:05.100
Well, something from Japan that we are going to be seeing on the Virtual Console.

03:05.100 --> 03:12.100
Thank you, ESRB, for spilling the beans on a few new releases that are going to be coming out.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.100
Mega Drive had a game in Japan only.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.100
It was called Glay Lancer.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.100
Not gray, that's Glay. G-L-E-Y.

03:18.100 --> 03:22.100
Glay Lancer came out, and that's supposedly going to be coming out here soon.

03:22.100 --> 03:29.100
Konami had a game on the NES called Biomiracle Bakute Upa.

03:29.100 --> 03:36.100
Both of those games are going to make their way if the ESRB is to be believed, which usually they are pretty reliable.

03:36.100 --> 03:41.100
Also, just as an FYI, other games that were spotted on the ESRB's website, these aren't imports,

03:41.100 --> 03:45.100
but pretty cool nonetheless, City Connection for the NES.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.100
That was a Jellico game. I don't know if you remember that game.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.100
It had the heart.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.100
Dark Sakura will be happy about this.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.100
Alex Kidd in Miracle World finally coming out.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
I know it's not Shinobi World, but it's the next best game.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.100
I was going to say yay.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.100
Oh, you were?

03:58.100 --> 03:59.100
Yes.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.100
I thought you were going to complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.100
I was going to say yay and then complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.100
Alright, sorry, my bad.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.100
God, Rob.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.100
Don't put words in my mouth.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.100
What's that game? It's not Rock Paper Scissors. What do they call it in Alex Kidd?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.100
John Ken Pon.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.100
John Ken Pon.

04:14.100 --> 04:18.100
You can play that to your heart's content in Alex Kidd Miracle World.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.100
Coming soon.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.100
But now more news.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.100
Because no ganous is good ganous.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.100
Wait, wrong show.

04:27.100 --> 04:34.100
Well, this is a story brought to me by the lovely and talented Tiara,

04:34.100 --> 04:40.100
who is sitting next to me with her thumb in the air.

04:40.100 --> 04:46.100
It's product placement done wrong.

04:46.100 --> 04:52.100
There's this huge, massive Wii Fit, you know, humongoid thing.

04:52.100 --> 04:58.100
And it's right over Chevy's in Times Square.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.100
But isn't it healthy because it's like fresh mix and stuff?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.100
Yeah, it's fresh mix.

05:02.100 --> 05:07.100
You can have a big fucking burrito and a big fucking margarita as big as your head.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.100
It's exactly what I said earlier.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.100
And you could be healthy because you'll go home to Wii Fit.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.100
Yeah, you won't care because you'll go home drunk and fall off the Wii.

05:15.100 --> 05:20.100
Look, as long as I have a salad and bottomless chips and salsa, I'll be fine, right?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.100
No.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.100
But it's a salad, Jamie.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.100
But I have to tell my Chevy story.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.100
With avocado and sour cream, I'll be fine, right?

05:26.100 --> 05:27.100
Sour cream.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.100
You can't have sour cream.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.100
You're nowhere sponsored by Chevy's.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.100
I have a Chevy story, though.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.100
All right, real quick, since we are orange lounge foodio.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.100
I ordered a margarita.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.100
It was a prickly pear margarita, and I ordered a small one, so you know it was massive.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.100
And they spilled a third of it.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.100
Oh, no, so I had to give you another one.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.100
No.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.100
What?

05:46.100 --> 05:49.100
They refilled that third with tequila.

05:49.100 --> 05:55.100
And I'm eating my seafood fajitas, which is probably the thing I get every time I go there.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.100
Drinking down this hefty...

05:57.100 --> 05:59.100
And you know me and tequila on top of that.

05:59.100 --> 06:03.100
You know, it's like Drew said earlier, waffles.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.100
Waffles, waffles, waffles.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.100
You know the last time I had that much tequila anywhere near you guys, I passed out.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.100
No, I threw up because everyone lit up in the living room at Tia's house.

06:13.100 --> 06:18.100
And by the time before that, I ate half a box of waffles in your bed.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.100
What?

06:20.100 --> 06:24.100
Well, A, I just saw Guardian Legend on my TV, so I got distracted for a minute.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.100
Shiny.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.100
Loki's playing with all these things he shouldn't be on the Wii right now.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.100
Sorry.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.100
It's very distracting.

06:30.100 --> 06:34.100
So now, from here on, I'm going to associate Wii Fit with Chevy's and, therefore, margarita.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.100
So whenever I think of Wii Fit, I'll get drunk.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.100
I'll tell you what, though.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.100
I think the product placement is working.

06:38.100 --> 06:42.100
I mean, maybe not in this particular case, but you can't find Wii Fit anywhere right now.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.100
I missed launch day.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.100
I slept through it or whatever.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.100
And I didn't get the game when it came out, and I'll never get it now.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.100
Right, Loki?

06:49.100 --> 06:50.100
Probably.

06:50.100 --> 06:56.100
It's in short supply right now because those Wii Balance boards are fucking hard to manufacture.

06:56.100 --> 07:02.100
I was in GameStop in Las Vegas a few days ago, one of the most obese cities in the nation,

07:02.100 --> 07:06.100
and there were like 75 Wii Fit boards just sitting there.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.100
It was like they couldn't get rid of them.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.100
Damn it.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.100
Please take these.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.100
Damn it.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.100
I'm shopping in the wrong place.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.100
Because people are like, money?

07:12.100 --> 07:14.100
I have to gamble that away.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.100
See, KikoMan2DX in chat says Wii Fit is in Costco.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.100
I was just at Costco today, and no it wasn't.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.100
I looked.

07:20.100 --> 07:24.100
I mean, maybe in your neck of the woods, but not mine, sadly.

07:24.100 --> 07:31.100
In regards to Wii Fit, just a little reference to the hardcore old school computer nerds out there.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
Two words spring to mind.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.100
Guru meditation.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.100
Imagine that on the Wii Fit board.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.100
How about dance aerobics?

07:39.100 --> 07:40.100
That's old school for you.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.100
That works too.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.100
Dance aerobics.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.100
Remember that game on the NES for the power pad?

07:43.100 --> 07:44.100
Yeah.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.100
Dance aerobics is hardcore.

07:46.100 --> 07:50.100
Well, don't they have something like that coming out in Japan from Namco?

07:50.100 --> 07:52.100
It's got like a little power pad thing.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
Dude, they could do it with like real music now too.

07:54.100 --> 07:58.100
They don't need those crappy little like, well, not that NES music was crappy because it wasn't,

07:58.100 --> 08:01.100
but they could actually have like real songs in it and stuff.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.100
You know, I could work out to Britney Spears.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
It'd be fun.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.100
Well, it would be fun.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.100
For a minute.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.100
For a minute?

08:10.100 --> 08:13.100
Yeah.

08:13.100 --> 08:19.100
This game may not be Wii Fit, and it certainly is not dance aerobics,

08:19.100 --> 08:23.100
but coming to WiiWare soon is a game that is probably just as important,

08:23.100 --> 08:28.100
and that would be the official beer pong game.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.100
That's right.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.100
Just what I needed.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.100
Coming to the Wii.

08:31.100 --> 08:37.100
In fact, according to the website features cup, ball, and beer in good times.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.100
Two girls, one cup.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.100
Right?

08:41.100 --> 08:47.100
And anyways, so yeah, it will be coming to a Wii near you,

08:47.100 --> 08:51.100
and also, I mean, shit, they have Game Party out right now,

08:51.100 --> 08:55.100
which has a game called Ping Cup, which is essentially the same damn thing for 20 bucks,

08:55.100 --> 08:59.100
but you know, if you want to pay $10 or whatever when this comes out,

08:59.100 --> 09:01.100
you can go ahead and do that as well.

09:01.100 --> 09:08.100
This is the first of a new games division from JV Games, their frat party games.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.100
Frat party games, beer pong.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.100
I'm sorry, why would you play beer pong without real beer?

09:13.100 --> 09:14.100
I wonder if they're going to have...

09:14.100 --> 09:17.100
Maybe you're not 21.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.100
Then why would you be playing beer pong?

09:19.100 --> 09:22.100
Frat party games in preparation for being 21.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.100
That'd be pretty cool.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.100
There's no point.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.100
So no word on when it's going to come out or how much it's going to be,

09:29.100 --> 09:31.100
but I can tell you right now...

09:31.100 --> 09:33.100
Or how drunk you won't get playing it.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.100
Yeah, how drunk you won't get.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.100
I feel totally wasted right now.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.100
Well, you can always add alcohol to it, so you know.

09:42.100 --> 09:48.100
You may be in a cramped dorm and may not have room to set up a beer pong setup,

09:48.100 --> 09:51.100
so you know what, this will help you out.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.100
All right.

09:52.100 --> 09:55.100
Well, if there's one thing in the world better than beer pong,

09:55.100 --> 10:00.100
it's Spinal and Orchid and Glacius.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.100
Was that his name?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.100
Combo Breaker.

10:03.100 --> 10:07.100
Combo Breaker and all those characters that were in Killer Instinct.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.100
I'll be damned if this rumor doesn't come up once a year.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.100
It's back, and it's thanks to EGM and the Quarterman.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.100
He always has us call him an EGM.

10:15.100 --> 10:22.100
Apparently, Rare is going to be making a third entry in the Killer Instinct franchise.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.100
Of course, Rare has denied this before,

10:24.100 --> 10:28.100
but apparently there is a game in the works, Killer Instinct 3D.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.100
Death, Destruction, and Doom.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.100
Get it? 3Ds.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.100
Death, Destruction, and Doom.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
It's apparently on the Xbox 360.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.100
Will she still have the boob attack?

10:36.100 --> 10:37.100
I hope so.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.100
Yes, please.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.100
Apparently, though, it will not be using the pre-rendered stuff

10:41.100 --> 10:43.100
that was seen in the previous game.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.100
There's kind of a bummer.

10:44.100 --> 10:50.100
It'll just be 3D visuals and more robust gameplay, whatever that means.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.100
Bigger bus.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.100
Yay!

10:52.100 --> 10:53.100
Bigger bus.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.100
Because Maya had some pretty big busts.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.100
I don't know if you saw that,

10:58.100 --> 11:00.100
but that was a combo breaker of a different kind.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.100
It should be more mobust replay.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.100
Ultra combo me any day.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.100
All right.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.100
I don't know.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.100
Take with a giant grain of salt,

11:10.100 --> 11:14.100
but I don't think any of us would complain if this were true.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.100
Right?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
I know I wouldn't.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.100
You know what they should do when there's a game that's being announced

11:19.100 --> 11:22.100
that everyone's been rumoring for it to come out for a long time?

11:22.100 --> 11:26.100
They should send everybody in the press a giant grain of salt.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.100
That would be hilarious.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.100
That would be fun.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.100
Good idea.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.100
I need a moment.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.100
My browser just died.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.100
Uh-oh.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.100
So we can't get to the next story now?

11:35.100 --> 11:36.100
I'm all over it.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.100
What are we going to do?

11:37.100 --> 11:40.100
The show has collapsed.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.100
All right.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.100
Quickly then, some more discussion.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.100
Things you would most want to see in Killer Instinct 3.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.100
What do you think Killer Instinct 3 needs more than anything?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.100
Jubblies.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.100
Banjo-Kazooie.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
No, it does not.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.100
As a character.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.100
Okay, it's up.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.100
All right, thank God.

11:59.100 --> 12:04.100
There are supposed to be new colors for the DS in Europe

12:04.100 --> 12:10.100
if anyone gives half a crap.

12:10.100 --> 12:14.100
Puke green, according to Tiara.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.100
There is.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.100
Monkey snot.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.100
I like how the article said slime green.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.100
That's actually lime green.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.100
Hot red and ice blue.

12:24.100 --> 12:29.100
And it's supposed to have dates of June 13th.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.100
But we don't know.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.100
Hot red.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.100
Ice blue.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.100
Sounds like stripper names.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.100
Hot red.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.100
Lime green.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.100
Oh, yeah.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.100
That sounds like American Gladiators.

12:39.100 --> 12:44.100
I was just thinking that.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.100
Nice.

12:45.100 --> 12:51.100
By the way, American Gladiators, one of those shows that's so bad it's good.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.100
I watch American Gladiators every week.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.100
Good times.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.100
You would.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.100
I love American Gladiators.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.100
It's great.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.100
I hope they make a new game.

12:59.100 --> 13:04.100
All I have to say is that in the previews, Atlas Sphere is coming back this year.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.100
By the way.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.100
Thank God.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.100
What?

13:07.100 --> 13:08.100
My man won.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.100
I am pleased.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.100
The old American Gladiators season one?

13:11.100 --> 13:12.100
No, American Idol.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.100
Oh, American Idol.

13:13.100 --> 13:18.100
I thought you didn't want him to win because then he would be stuck in the record contract.

13:18.100 --> 13:23.100
I was sort of at half months because I wanted him to win so that David Archuleta's dad would

13:23.100 --> 13:25.100
have an aneurysm.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
Are we really having American Idol?

13:27.100 --> 13:28.100
I'm not having this discussion.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.100
All right.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.100
Thank God.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.100
Okay, I'm done.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.100
All right.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.100
Next topic.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.100
Anyways.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.100
So, yeah.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.100
Something I've been distracted by lately.

13:37.100 --> 13:41.100
The Wii Homebrew channel has been released.

13:41.100 --> 13:46.100
Yes, they've gotten it so bad now to where they can inject their own channels into the

13:46.100 --> 13:47.100
Wii.

13:47.100 --> 13:51.100
And it's just insane the amount of stuff that you can do now.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.100
Emulators, games, you name it.

13:54.100 --> 13:58.100
It's available and hopefully I'll be demonstrating it a little bit later.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.100
But yes, it is available now.

13:59.100 --> 14:04.100
You can install it using the Twilight hack, which is actually pretty interesting in the

14:04.100 --> 14:05.100
way it works.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.100
But pretty simple to do.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.100
There's instructions all over the internet.

14:09.100 --> 14:15.100
So if you want to get your homebrew on while it, you know, works, feel free to check your

14:15.100 --> 14:20.100
local Wii hacking community forums and you should be able to find it.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.100
Yeah.

14:21.100 --> 14:24.100
We reached out to Nintendo for some comment on what they were going to do about this situation

14:24.100 --> 14:27.100
and what they had to say about this whole thing.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.100
That's all they had to say.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.100
Is this going to be the new sandstorm?

14:37.100 --> 14:39.100
That's all they had to say.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.100
No, because we can't drop E and rave.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.100
It is quite sexy.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.100
And hump the coin return of a potter potter machine.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.100
They do have a bunch of stuff out for it right now.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.100
You can get ScummVM for it.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.100
They actually have a Tetris game that's someone's program.

14:52.100 --> 14:56.100
There's emulators for practically everything Nintendo 64, Turbo Graphics, Game Boy Color

14:56.100 --> 14:59.100
Games, NES, Super NES.

14:59.100 --> 15:04.100
They have a region free player for GameCube games.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.100
You can build that in there.

15:06.100 --> 15:11.100
They've also got, you can upload Miis to it.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.100
You can totally customize the stuff.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.100
It's extremely easy to use.

15:16.100 --> 15:20.100
And yeah, so more of that later.

15:20.100 --> 15:24.100
Including the ability to play Guardian Legend.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.100
Do you think that this, just real quick before we move on,

15:28.100 --> 15:31.100
do you think this is something that they'll block in a future patch?

15:31.100 --> 15:34.100
I mean, wouldn't this be very easy to close the hole in it?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.100
They may be able to, but it's going to be pretty hard.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.100
Or is this going to be like the PSP where it's ongoing?

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
I think it's going to be ongoing.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.100
They haven't been able to block the Twilight hack thing,

15:45.100 --> 15:47.100
so that's going to be hard.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.100
Even if this homebrew channel thing gets blocked,

15:49.100 --> 15:53.100
you can still use that Twilight hack to load almost anything you want.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.100
This just makes it simpler.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.100
It puts it all on your SD memory card.

15:56.100 --> 15:59.100
Instead of having to load individual programs,

15:59.100 --> 16:00.100
you can just keep it all on there.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.100
Just visit this channel and load any homebrew programs you want.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.100
And I think it looks pretty nice.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.100
I mean, it's got the animations just like the other channels.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.100
It's really professionally done.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.100
Alright, well going back over to Nintendo for a little bit.

16:14.100 --> 16:17.100
And Nintendo and Mistwalker's relationship.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.100
You know, Mistwalker, of course, they have some games on the Xbox 360.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.100
Kind of something interesting you may not realize.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.100
Nintendo doesn't really have anything officially on the calendar right now

16:26.100 --> 16:28.100
after Wii Fit has been out.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.100
They're probably going to wait for E3 to really unveil

16:30.100 --> 16:32.100
whatever else is coming out for the rest of the year.

16:32.100 --> 16:36.100
But, thank you ESRB, who's given us a lot of news this week.

16:36.100 --> 16:41.100
The ESRB did rate a game called ASH, Archaic Sealed Heat.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.100
And this is a game that's coming out on the Nintendo DS.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.100
This is a game that already came out in Japan.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.100
So if it's been rated by the ESRB,

16:49.100 --> 16:52.100
then there must be a localization on the way.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.100
But that is interesting because that shows that Mistwalker

16:54.100 --> 16:57.100
is developing for more things than just Xbox.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.100
But there is kind of that weird relationship with Microsoft's own studio

17:00.100 --> 17:03.100
because there's the Viva Pinata game already announced for DS as well.

17:03.100 --> 17:07.100
Well, THQ is doing a lot of those and same with the Blue Dragon DS game too.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.100
Yeah, so it's not like Microsoft properties are afraid to go over to DS,

17:10.100 --> 17:14.100
which I think further cements the fact there won't be a Microsoft handheld anytime soon.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.100
So those rumors can just go away.

17:16.100 --> 17:20.100
Did you hear about how they were originally thinking about adding connectivity

17:20.100 --> 17:25.100
with Viva Pinata 2 and the Viva Pinata DS?

17:25.100 --> 17:27.100
That would be very interesting, but could they do it?

17:27.100 --> 17:31.100
Well, the way they had it done, it was only one way.

17:31.100 --> 17:36.100
You could transfer stuff from your DS version to your Xbox 360.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.100
And the way they did it was, I don't know, there was another story coming out

17:39.100 --> 17:42.100
that they were going to have cards that you could buy

17:42.100 --> 17:44.100
or something that would allow you to...

17:44.100 --> 17:46.100
It's essentially like the Eye of Judgment card.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
I was going to say, this sounds like Eye of Judgment to me.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.100
But yeah, that's how the game would work.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.100
It would produce a high resolution picture on there,

17:53.100 --> 17:55.100
and then you would scan it with your camera.

17:55.100 --> 17:59.100
Speaking of Eye of Judgment, I looked at the OLR Wiki this week,

17:59.100 --> 18:02.100
where we've got awesome people maintaining the OLR Wiki

18:02.100 --> 18:04.100
at orangelaunchradio.wiki.com.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.100
You can learn a lot of stuff about the inside jokes of our show and everything.

18:07.100 --> 18:11.100
Apparently, the Eye of Judgment has sold now 200,000 units.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.100
We're one-fifth of the way there.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.100
Never going to happen. Never going to happen.

18:15.100 --> 18:19.100
I just love the fact that that's actually being tracked and updated on a regular basis.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.100
Love it.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.100
Start squirming, Loki. Start squirming.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.100
Love it.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
It's not going to happen.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.100
It'll happen. All right.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.100
Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.100
No, we're not. We're going to go to the mailbag, because...

18:32.100 --> 18:34.100
I refuse.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.100
It's probably very full. Too bad.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.100
I refuse.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.100
Too bad.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.100
Then let the ferret read the emails tonight.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.100
Hell no. I won't read.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.100
Let TRR read them. I don't care.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.100
We've got to do some emails.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.100
No, the only one I'm going to read is hers.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.100
All right, mailbag.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.100
You're only going to read one email after two weeks being gone?

18:46.100 --> 18:47.100
Yeah.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.100
What do we want?

18:48.100 --> 18:49.100
Plus a few others.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.100
All right, thank you.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.100
All right, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to participate.

18:52.100 --> 18:57.100
TRR Sakura, open up the mailbag, pull out a few of your favorites, and read them.

18:57.100 --> 19:02.100
This one says, dear people, my girlfriend wants a DS and a PSP.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.100
She has a PS3.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.100
Please use...

19:04.100 --> 19:05.100
Oh, my God.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.100
Please use a period.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.100
Thank you.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.100
Okay, what was I saying?

19:10.100 --> 19:11.100
Oh, yeah.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.100
I was wondering...

19:12.100 --> 19:15.100
Did I mention when you email us, Jamie berates you?

19:15.100 --> 19:16.100
I was wondering.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.100
She's only 16, and I'm wondering.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.100
You already said you were wondering.

19:19.100 --> 19:26.100
If you had any ideas for a game to buy her, she'd love music, RPGs, and FPS.

19:26.100 --> 19:32.100
What teen-rated games in those genre are good so I can make her a happy gamer girl?

19:32.100 --> 19:36.100
Peace out, dsmaster25 and dsloverps.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.100
We worship Hannah Montana.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.100
Woeship, W-O-E.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.100
I woeship her, too.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.100
I would make a suggestion as for a good game to get her.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.100
For the DS?

19:48.100 --> 19:49.100
My word, coach.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.100
Yes.

19:50.100 --> 19:57.100
But you haven't really specified what system since you mentioned that she wants a DS and

19:57.100 --> 19:59.100
PSP, indicating that she has neither.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.100
Typing of the Dead.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.100
And has a PS3.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.100
Yeah, I get Typing of the Dead.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.100
If they get a PSP, there's not a lot of music games available for it.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.100
Actually, there's no music games available for it in the United States.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.100
Guitar Man.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.100
Guitar Man, yeah, that's about it.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.100
Brappa.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.100
I suggest getting her an Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip on it.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.100
Ooh.

20:15.100 --> 20:20.100
Our first person shooters, you're going to find a few of them on the PSP, not so many

20:20.100 --> 20:21.100
on the DS.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.100
Give her a baby.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.100
It's what she really wants.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.100
Give her Imagine Babies.

20:24.100 --> 20:29.100
She can have my copy.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.100
I played it.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.100
You saw me play it.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.100
Tell her you're getting ready for your long future together.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.100
Anyways, so then I would, I don't know.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.100
We're never going to get another email ever again.

20:40.100 --> 20:45.100
If she already has a PS3, you might as well just stick with the PSP, because then you

20:45.100 --> 20:48.100
can connect to it and download stuff via the PlayStation Store.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.100
That's true.

20:49.100 --> 20:52.100
There's also PlayStation 1 games that are available on there, and also if you want to

20:52.100 --> 20:56.100
really hack the thing apart, you can play all the sorts of emulators and that kind of

20:56.100 --> 20:57.100
stuff.

20:57.100 --> 21:00.100
You can also do the same thing with the DS as well.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.100
So, really, it's how much you want to spend.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.100
The PSP is going to be more expensive for you.

21:04.100 --> 21:09.100
Whereas the DS, you can find it cheaper and you can probably get a game for it for the

21:09.100 --> 21:10.100
same price.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.100
Right.

21:11.100 --> 21:15.100
And then you can put, you know what, if you get a, the nice thing about the PSP versus

21:15.100 --> 21:18.100
the DS is that you can set themes on the PSP.

21:18.100 --> 21:23.100
So what you can do is you can put a picture of yourself in the background on the PSP so

21:23.100 --> 21:28.100
that she can always take you with her wherever she goes as a constant reminder of your undying

21:28.100 --> 21:29.100
love for each other.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.100
There you go.

21:30.100 --> 21:35.100
I also think that you should install a dictionary and a thesaurus and a grammar checker for

21:35.100 --> 21:36.100
your phone.

21:36.100 --> 21:41.100
I think that this is cool because I honestly think that this person is Russian or from

21:41.100 --> 21:44.100
somewhere that uses the same form of alphabet.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.100
I'm not really all that great with names.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.100
But it's in the best screen cap ever.

21:49.100 --> 21:59.100
It's a Google search to define STFU and definitions of STFU on the web, this is the only one that

21:59.100 --> 22:05.100
came up, is a weekly half hour show hosted by, it brings up the stuff on the show.

22:05.100 --> 22:09.100
Nice, so an old reference to the show that DMN hosted on the network.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.100
Yeah, DJ Tyrant too.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.100
Yes, and DJ Tyrant.

22:12.100 --> 22:16.100
DMN, I don't think DJ Tyrant is involved with this, maybe it's a special guest or something,

22:16.100 --> 22:20.100
but DMN has teamed up with Travis Donovan and they now do a show on All Games Radio,

22:20.100 --> 22:24.100
if you haven't heard it yet, it's Under Sedation Live 4.0.

22:24.100 --> 22:30.100
So it's the show that Jamie and I started on, all grown up and retarded.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.100
I was the number one guest.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.100
You were.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.100
Plus I filled in for Jessica.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.100
But now they're up to 4.0.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.100
I filled in for you a couple of times.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.100
Sure did, because I was lazy.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.100
Where are they now? Rob Roberts.

22:42.100 --> 22:45.100
I got to speak, sit in the speaker chair.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.100
I just wanted to give a cheap plug.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.100
Which we found the speaker chair.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.100
Really?

22:49.100 --> 22:51.100
At the Desiree thrift store.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.100
Nice.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.100
We checked.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.100
Nice.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.100
A few years ago.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.100
Next email.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.100
Okay, this one comes from Sauce.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.100
Okay, wait, you have to explain for listeners.

23:00.100 --> 23:01.100
Listeners don't know Sauce.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.100
What is Sauce?

23:02.100 --> 23:08.100
There are a group of us who have known each other for probably going on

23:08.100 --> 23:10.100
over ten years online.

23:10.100 --> 23:15.100
And Kim, who is one of the group, used to always call me Sis.

23:15.100 --> 23:18.100
But she's like a terrible typer.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.100
And she's like the typo queen.

23:20.100 --> 23:24.100
So one day she typoed and instead of, she was trying to say,

23:24.100 --> 23:25.100
Sits on Sis.

23:25.100 --> 23:28.100
And she put Sots on Sauce.

23:28.100 --> 23:32.100
And so ever since then, I've been Sauce. S-O-S.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.100
And it just kind of, we made up names for everybody.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.100
Like after that.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.100
Very nice.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.100
And mine is, when we get together, it's Soy Sauce Reunion.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.100
Soy Sauce.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.100
Cute.

23:43.100 --> 23:44.100
It works.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.100
So, hello Sos, Rob, and otherwise.

23:46.100 --> 23:51.100
Girls are so weird, I swear.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.100
Get ferreted.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.100
Burn it.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.100
Okay, this is the Uberlong review.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.100
Alright.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.100
I'm writing to give a review of the new Iron Man game that was

23:59.100 --> 24:02.100
released on many platforms at the beginning of the month.

24:02.100 --> 24:05.100
The version of the game I have is the PSP version and as such

24:05.100 --> 24:07.100
the review is for that particular version.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.100
Thank you for clarifying.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.100
The game itself only has a small amount of storyline related to

24:13.100 --> 24:14.100
the movie itself.

24:14.100 --> 24:17.100
This may throw off players that have never read any Iron Man

24:17.100 --> 24:19.100
or to a lesser extent Marvel comics.

24:19.100 --> 24:21.100
But it's a great treat for true fans.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.100
Subplots include such Iron Man favorites as,

24:23.100 --> 24:26.100
I never pronounced this right, the Magia.

24:26.100 --> 24:30.100
Whitney Frost, also known as Madame Mask and Titanium Man.

24:30.100 --> 24:34.100
The bulk of the plot involves AIM.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.100
I hate them.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.100
I hate scrolls worse.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.100
The story is good.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.100
The graphics are more than fairly decent as is most of the voice

24:43.100 --> 24:44.100
acting.

24:44.100 --> 24:47.100
Tony Stark is much more brash and cocky than he is in the movie.

24:47.100 --> 24:50.100
And even I was surprised by some of the things he said.

24:50.100 --> 24:53.100
There are also plenty of unlockables to keep players busy

24:53.100 --> 24:56.100
using weapons of three different types, repulsor,

24:56.100 --> 24:58.100
gabbling gun and rockets.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.100
Unlocks better weapons and progressing through the game

25:00.100 --> 25:01.100
unlocks different armors.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.100
There are of course the Mark 1 through 3 armors in the movie

25:03.100 --> 25:06.100
plus the golden Avenger armor, the classic red and gold armor,

25:06.100 --> 25:09.100
stealth armor and the titanium man armor.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.100
Other unlockables include death races where you fly through

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
marker beacons as fast as possible while avoiding enemy

25:14.100 --> 25:17.100
fire and speed kills where you see how many enemies you can

25:17.100 --> 25:20.100
defeat before time runs out.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.100
Now I can take a breath.

25:22.100 --> 25:24.100
You were really busy.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.100
Okay.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.100
The drawback to this game, at least on the PSP,

25:27.100 --> 25:29.100
is the way the player controls the game.

25:29.100 --> 25:31.100
The controls are very uncomfortable and took me quite a bit

25:31.100 --> 25:35.100
to get used to, especially the flying mechanics.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.100
There is no option to change or rearrange the controls

25:37.100 --> 25:39.100
to make them easier to use.

25:39.100 --> 25:42.100
Using the square XO triangle buttons to control the camera

25:42.100 --> 25:46.100
and analog stick to control pushing forward backwards motion

25:46.100 --> 25:49.100
was very uncomfortable for me, especially since pushing up

25:49.100 --> 25:52.100
on the analog stick makes you walk or hover forward,

25:52.100 --> 25:55.100
but moving into flight mode makes pushing up on the analog stick

25:55.100 --> 25:59.100
actually makes you go crashing down so it reverses from

25:59.100 --> 26:04.100
standard running around mode to like jet controls.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.100
Okay.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.100
All right.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.100
Whereas pushing down on the analog stick makes you pull back up.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.100
I suppose in a way this makes sense, but the sudden reversal

26:12.100 --> 26:15.100
of the controls makes flying a pain, especially when you wind up

26:15.100 --> 26:17.100
running around and then jumping into flight a lot.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.100
It took me two run-throughs of the training level

26:19.100 --> 26:22.100
to get used to the controls, and even after 13 levels of play,

26:22.100 --> 26:24.100
I'm still hindered by the awkward controls.

26:24.100 --> 26:27.100
Overall, Iron Man for the PSP is a fun game.

26:27.100 --> 26:30.100
The controls, however, definitely detract from it overall.

26:30.100 --> 26:34.100
If you're a die-hard Iron Man fan like I am, then she is.

26:34.100 --> 26:36.100
This is worth having in your collection.

26:36.100 --> 26:38.100
However, if your knowledge of Iron Man is based solely on the movie,

26:38.100 --> 26:40.100
I wouldn't bother.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.100
My overall rating for this game is 6.5 out of 10.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.100
Thanks, and keep up the great job with the show, T.R.I.P.S.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.100
Rob is so eating cake on my birthday, frowning face.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.100
We'll see. We'll see.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.100
But that was a good review.

26:52.100 --> 26:55.100
You should write reviews for our website whenever we get it working.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.100
You should be. I already knew you were working.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.100
Yes, ReviewWench.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.100
Actually, Sauce has their own theme song, and so we can play it.

27:02.100 --> 27:13.100
Can you hear me, darling? Can't you hear me? S.O.S.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.100
No, I have to explain this.

27:15.100 --> 27:19.100
Remember in the old days when I had my own show, Sniff Cry Wine?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
Right.

27:21.100 --> 27:26.100
I would randomly play the...

27:26.100 --> 27:31.100
What was that group that did all the boob and dick songs?

27:31.100 --> 27:33.100
I don't know.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.100
Oh, no. Erotic.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.100
Oh, Erotic.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.100
I would play Erotic's version.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.100
Yes.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
But the tiger took my family.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.100
That was... No.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.100
I would play Erotic's...

27:44.100 --> 27:46.100
But, no.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.100
I would play Erotic's version.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.100
No.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.100
So that's officially... That is officially...

27:52.100 --> 28:01.100
One Orange Jug video.

28:01.100 --> 28:04.100
Boob, dick, boob, dick, boob, dick.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.100
Come on, if you have something, come help me dodge your dick.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.100
We know this well.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.100
But this will come into play later.

28:12.100 --> 28:16.100
You know, some day in your nightmare, somebody's gonna crop that little piece of show

28:16.100 --> 28:19.100
and play that over and over.

28:19.100 --> 28:25.100
They have a song called Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.100
And the very first song...

28:26.100 --> 28:28.100
And they were huge in DDR, by the way.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.100
And the very first song I ever heard by them was before...

28:30.100 --> 28:32.100
Was actually when I had played Beat...

28:32.100 --> 28:35.100
Was still playing Beatmania 98 before we even had a 2DX.

28:35.100 --> 28:39.100
Or when DDR was still just a thought.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.100
Was Don't Talk Dirty.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.100
It was like the best video.

28:43.100 --> 28:52.100
Max...

28:52.100 --> 28:54.100
What's the lyric?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.100
That's the first part of the song.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.100
Max, Max, call me Max.

28:57.100 --> 28:59.100
I'm taking what it gives and I'm giving what it takes.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.100
Max, Max, Max.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.100
I'm in love with you and I want you.

29:01.100 --> 29:04.100
I miss DDR when it was like at song play incidents.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.100
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.100
I gotta warn you.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.100
Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.100
It will make your life complex.

29:11.100 --> 29:13.100
Max, Max, Max.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.100
These songs are available on iTunes, by the way.

29:15.100 --> 29:17.100
And I highly suggest you buy the entire thing.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.100
Buy the entire thing.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.100
We cannot make this shit up.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.100
Well, we could, but we're actually telling the truth.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.100
We could, but, you know, yeah.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.100
Next email!

29:26.100 --> 29:27.100
Wait, hold on.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.100
Just, I have to read the...

29:29.100 --> 29:31.100
Look, I have the album Greatest Tits.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.100
Here's the songs on Greatest Tits.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.100
The horniest single in the world.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.100
Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.100
Willy Use a Billy Boy.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.100
Help Me Dr. Dick.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.100
Fred Come to Bed.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.100
Turn Me On.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.100
Gotta Get It Groovin'.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.100
Gimme Good Sex.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.100
Fritz Love My Tits.

29:48.100 --> 29:49.100
Sex on the Phone.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.100
Sexual Madness.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.100
SOS.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.100
The Winner Takes It All.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.100
Baby Please Me.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.100
And In the Dark of the Night.

29:55.100 --> 29:58.100
Cause we all know what happens in the dark of the night.

29:58.100 --> 30:01.100
We have booty calls all over the stuff.

30:01.100 --> 30:05.100
We have two ABBA songs and, um, yeah.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.100
So next email, okay?

30:06.100 --> 30:07.100
I used to love Sex on the Phone, though.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.100
This song was awesome.

30:08.100 --> 30:20.100
But it doesn't have Don't Talk Dirty on it.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.100
They have tons of albums.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.100
It's not just the Greatest Tits.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.100
There's just tons.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.100
Next email.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.100
Next email.

30:26.100 --> 30:32.100
Dear Mailbag, like it can talk back, I'd like to think you all will have caught this piece

30:32.100 --> 30:36.100
of news, but since it was tagged onto the end of another story, I want to make sure

30:36.100 --> 30:37.100
you didn't miss it.

30:37.100 --> 30:41.100
I know that Skye, at least, is a huge fan of Actraiser.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.100
And there's a link that says, loves you, Apollo.

30:44.100 --> 30:48.100
This message is not brought to you by Taco Bell because it is gross.

30:48.100 --> 30:52.100
It's on Gamasutra.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.100
I like what I'm hearing already about Actraiser.

30:54.100 --> 31:01.100
Square Enix is talking about WiiWare and new Actraiser possibilities.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.100
Like an Actraiser game on WiiWare?

31:03.100 --> 31:08.100
I will save this for the end of the show.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.100
That's awesome.

31:09.100 --> 31:14.100
I will make you wait in anticipation.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
Thanks.

31:15.100 --> 31:18.100
I'm not going to say anything.

31:18.100 --> 31:21.100
Until Rob decides to play me some more Erotic.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.100
You want some more Erotic?

31:22.100 --> 31:23.100
No.

31:23.100 --> 31:28.100
So that means you have to wait a really fucking long time.

31:28.100 --> 31:33.100
Actually, do you have some?

31:33.100 --> 31:34.100
Do I have Don't Talk Dirty?

31:34.100 --> 31:35.100
I don't know.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.100
You should play it after the show.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.100
If I can find it.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.100
I don't know if I have it.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.100
We'll see.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.100
Next email.

31:40.100 --> 31:58.100
This is an iTunes sample.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.100
It doesn't have the actual chorus in there.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.100
Don't Talk Dirty was great.

32:01.100 --> 32:08.100
Is the music in the background of your FUs of the Week,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.100
Jumpman by Buckethead, or did you remix it?

32:10.100 --> 32:11.100
I know.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.100
I remixed it from Jumpman by Buckethead.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.100
Oh, you did?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.100
Okay.

32:15.100 --> 32:19.100
Pointless question by TJ Zeppelinz in the chat.

32:19.100 --> 32:22.100
And since I wasn't on the mic, I remixed that from Jumpman by Buckethead.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.100
Yes.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.100
That was where my O came from.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.100
Hey.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.100
Hey, you.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.100
Get out of my car.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.100
Hey, listen.

32:30.100 --> 32:33.100
Yesterday I listened to the Bobby Black Wolf Show and OLR

32:33.100 --> 32:35.100
on the PSP's official internet radio player.

32:35.100 --> 32:38.100
The quality was really good and there were no interruptions

32:38.100 --> 32:41.100
except for the times I disconnected and tried to reconnect.

32:41.100 --> 32:42.100
I have a couple of questions.

32:42.100 --> 32:45.100
One, is there any way to set the presets on the player?

32:45.100 --> 32:50.100
Is there another player that will work on the official Sony firmware?

32:50.100 --> 32:53.100
Sometimes it was hard to find the all-game stream.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.100
Sadly, I don't think there is.

32:55.100 --> 32:59.100
I've played with that whole thing limitedly on the PSP.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.100
I don't think there is a way to do it, sadly.

33:01.100 --> 33:04.100
The PSP thing is very limited.

33:04.100 --> 33:07.100
It sucks.

33:07.100 --> 33:09.100
Rob, you are a pain in my neck.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.100
Sorry.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.100
It's okay.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.100
Two.

33:12.100 --> 33:19.100
And for your intro.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.100
Anyhow.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.100
I need a ferret.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.100
Hey, listen.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.100
Hey, listen.

33:23.100 --> 33:26.100
Hey, listen.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.100
Thank you, Rob.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.100
Two.

33:28.100 --> 33:31.100
Is there any PSP-compatible way of IRC chatting?

33:31.100 --> 33:35.100
Listening live is great, but I want to chat, too.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.100
Alpha Canagram says it's called Free Play.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.100
It works for official firmware.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.100
I'm using it now and he's in chat, so.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.100
Okay.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.100
I also posted this in chat because I think the PSP and other devices

33:45.100 --> 33:48.100
could eventually be portable Internet radio devices

33:48.100 --> 33:51.100
that could receive shows from all over the world.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.100
And the next question.

33:52.100 --> 33:56.100
When is the fuck show going to happen or has Black Wolf already shot that one down?

33:56.100 --> 33:59.100
Well, I guess Understudiation Live 4.0 does have that one every Saturday.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.100
LOL.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.100
Thanks, PKJunior92.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.100
No matter where you go, you're there.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.100
We've said fuck and half a lot this episode, though, haven't we?

34:06.100 --> 34:09.100
If we told you when it was, that would break the rules of the fuck show.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.100
Yes, the fuck show is a surprise.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.100
I will tell you when it is not.

34:12.100 --> 34:16.100
The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

34:16.100 --> 34:19.100
And the sixth anniversary show is going to be...

34:19.100 --> 34:21.100
Whatever the fuck we want it.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.100
June...

34:22.100 --> 34:23.100
On the sixth anniversary.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.100
It can either be the...

34:24.100 --> 34:25.100
Probably the 22nd is the closest.

34:25.100 --> 34:28.100
June 22nd will be our sixth birthday.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.100
So I don't know what we're doing for that yet.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.100
Wow.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.100
Yeah.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.100
Sixth birthday.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.100
Wow.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.100
Yeah, I know.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.100
For real.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.100
Our show is old enough to be in first grade.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
Wow.

34:37.100 --> 34:40.100
Six years ago, Orange Launch Radio started.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.100
I know.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.100
It's crazy.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.100
Fuck.

34:43.100 --> 34:46.100
That's what I said.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.100
All right.

34:48.100 --> 34:49.100
So...

34:49.100 --> 34:50.100
Next email.

34:50.100 --> 34:51.100
Oh my god.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.100
I've got three left.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.100
Okay.

34:53.100 --> 34:57.100
I'm trying to be nice because we weren't here last weekend.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.100
Is there...

34:58.100 --> 34:59.100
Okay.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.100
Oh, we have one called...

35:00.100 --> 35:01.100
Hello.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.100
Hello.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.100
Is there anyone there?

35:04.100 --> 35:06.100
Have you fallen off the world?

35:06.100 --> 35:07.100
I miss you.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.100
Sad face Rick from UK.

35:08.100 --> 35:12.100
I think that was when our stream went forever with no new updates.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.100
Part B went out on Friday or Saturday.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.100
So hopefully...

35:15.100 --> 35:16.100
Yes, we're still alive.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.100
Rob had the plague.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.100
Yes, I had SARS.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.100
No, no, no, no, no.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.100
They put him on the cart even.

35:21.100 --> 35:24.100
He was about to get carried off to the incendiary area.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.100
But then you said he was going to go out for a walk.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.100
I actually would.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.100
When I was in the hospital, I remember being rolled around on a bed.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.100
It was kind of an interesting experience.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.100
I never really had that before.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.100
Did you...

35:34.100 --> 35:35.100
I'm not quite dead yet.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.100
I feel happy.

35:36.100 --> 35:41.100
I remember them rolling me out of the ER, into the room with the ultrasound, and rolling

35:41.100 --> 35:42.100
me into the CAT scan room.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.100
Did you hallucinate?

35:43.100 --> 35:44.100
Huh?

35:44.100 --> 35:45.100
Did you hallucinate?

35:45.100 --> 35:46.100
No.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.100
Poor Rob.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.100
I can make you hallucinate right now.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.100
Sometimes I think doing this show is hallucinating.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.100
We could bring Shermy over.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.100
She could fart on you.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.100
Next email.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.100
My cat got it back.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.100
I was going to say my cat pooped the rubber band today.

36:00.100 --> 36:04.100
I'm so fucking proud.

36:04.100 --> 36:07.100
I am so fucking proud of you.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.100
Shermy's not proud of her.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.100
I'm not really.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.100
Is that what this show is resorted to?

36:11.100 --> 36:13.100
But cats are like your children.

36:13.100 --> 36:14.100
Fuck!

36:14.100 --> 36:19.100
Coming up in Wii news, oh my cat pooped out a rubber band today.

36:19.100 --> 36:22.100
I'm very concerned because that means she ate a rubber band.

36:22.100 --> 36:26.100
It could have killed her.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.100
My cat eats grass.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.100
She loves grass.

36:28.100 --> 36:31.100
Seriously, fuck this show.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.100
Can I read the next email?

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
Sure.

36:34.100 --> 36:35.100
I don't care anymore.

36:35.100 --> 36:37.100
Sauce says I can't so this segment's over.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.100
Okay.

36:38.100 --> 36:42.100
Hello everyone in the world.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.100
We may as well be fucking doing a drunk show because we're all lunatics.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.100
Seriously.

36:47.100 --> 36:50.100
I would be drinking right now if it wouldn't kill me.

36:50.100 --> 36:54.100
For those of you who do not know me, I don't know you so okay.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.100
No, I'm kidding.

36:55.100 --> 37:00.100
My name is Chris Phillips aka ChrisPhil1724.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.100
Hi Chris.

37:01.100 --> 37:02.100
Must be a really old school name.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.100
A tournament slash event organizer for all games and all games.com.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.100
Oh yeah, he used to do video stuff for all games.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.100
I know he is.

37:08.100 --> 37:12.100
He's a good man, Charlie Brown.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.100
Don't cough up a rubber band.

37:14.100 --> 37:16.100
No.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.100
It was something a lot more delicious, Rob.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.100
All right.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.100
I'm going to get cookies.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.100
Yum.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.100
Anyway, on July...

37:23.100 --> 37:25.100
Do the fanfare.

37:25.100 --> 37:29.100
I got to find the...

37:29.100 --> 37:31.100
This means fanfare.

37:31.100 --> 37:35.100
I don't have a fanfare so this will have to do.

37:35.100 --> 37:44.100
I'm July 24th, 2005.

37:44.100 --> 37:48.100
Bobby Black Wolf aired his first live show on all games radio.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.100
Known as The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.100
This show was, in fact, the first ever weekly podcast on all games radio.

37:54.100 --> 38:01.100
Ever since that date, The Bobby Black Wolf Show has aired a new show every Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, 5 p.m. PST.

38:01.100 --> 38:05.100
A streak that has lasted nearly 35 months.

38:05.100 --> 38:13.100
This weekend was marked as the first week in 147 weeks without a new episode of The Bobby Black Wolf Show ending his remarkable run.

38:13.100 --> 38:19.100
Now Bobby would never broadcast this noteworthy accomplishment and we may not even like the fact that I'm doing this.

38:19.100 --> 38:23.100
There's fellow podcasters, you all know how hard it is to do a show week in and week out.

38:23.100 --> 38:28.100
To that end, my fieldless achievement is worth mentioning and congratulations are in order.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.100
If you'd like to write a small email to Bobby or...

38:30.100 --> 38:32.100
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.100
We're doing it live, Bobby!

38:33.100 --> 38:37.100
Yay!

38:37.100 --> 38:40.100
Well done, Darth Zagre.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.100
Let's hear it for Bobby Black Wolf.

38:42.100 --> 38:49.100
Let's hear it.

38:49.100 --> 38:52.100
I was looking for the moaning noises, but alright.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.100
No, that is a good accomplishment.

38:55.100 --> 39:00.100
It really is. I mean, god, we're lucky if we go ten weeks.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.100
Alright.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.100
Dear OLR and Loki 2.

39:04.100 --> 39:07.100
You know how that's gonna go.

39:07.100 --> 39:11.100
You're going to know in the first four words how that's going to go.

39:11.100 --> 39:15.100
I have a Macintosh and I don't use it to play games.

39:15.100 --> 39:20.100
I can understand why Loki would not like a Macintosh computer because he uses his computer to play video games.

39:20.100 --> 39:24.100
Now can we shut up about this whole Loki hates Macintoshes thing?

39:24.100 --> 39:27.100
They just don't deserve, they just don't serve his needs.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.100
To be honest, we sort of dropped this long ass fucking time ago.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.100
It's the listeners that keep bringing it up.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.100
Am I right?

39:33.100 --> 39:37.100
Well, once in a while there'll be a story and he'll make a snide comment that reminds us.

39:37.100 --> 39:41.100
But I don't think there's been a good old fashioned brawl over it in a while.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.100
The only people bringing it up is the fucking Mac users.

39:44.100 --> 39:48.100
My wife does this every time a stupid Mac commercial comes on TV.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.100
She's like, see, they said it's true.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.100
I'm like, shut up.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.100
It's on TV, it must be true.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.100
I'll never forget when the Mac fan came to Fauna Mae.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.100
Aw shit, I remember that last year.

39:59.100 --> 40:02.100
Which, by the way, notice we're not at Fauna Mae this year.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.100
It has other things to do.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.100
It was a conspiracy by Mac users.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.100
No, we'll be back at Fauna Mae next year, I promise.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.100
We have to.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.100
If we're still around. My god, we're getting old.

40:13.100 --> 40:14.100
You are.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.100
If we don't die of old age first.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.100
You're gonna die of the plague.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.100
Thanks.

40:19.100 --> 40:20.100
I'm gonna die of awesome.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.100
Dr. Mario will cure it.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.100
I'm gonna die of awesome.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.100
Alright, are you gonna read any more of this email?

40:24.100 --> 40:26.100
Should I?

40:26.100 --> 40:28.100
Pick a paragraph. Read a paragraph.

40:28.100 --> 40:30.100
That's not why I wrote.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.100
I wrote because I have a few things I want to say about Nintendo.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.100
Okay, whatever.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.100
Um.

40:36.100 --> 40:40.100
It's basically saying that Nintendo sells a lot of stuff.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.100
The end.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.100
Maybe you should post that on the super long email of the weak thread.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.100
I'm actually going to do that because right now my throat hurts.

40:51.100 --> 40:56.100
And it actually is from Hippolytus, aka Black Boy, who we remember.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.100
Yes.

40:57.100 --> 41:01.100
You are actually going to be the person who brings back

41:01.100 --> 41:06.100
The long ass fucking email thread of the weak.

41:06.100 --> 41:08.100
On OrangeDownsRadio.com

41:08.100 --> 41:09.100
Congratulations.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.100
I want to be the person who brings sexy back.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.100
Does this call for fanfare?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.100
Yes.

41:13.100 --> 41:16.100
Just because honestly, honestly, honestly.

41:16.100 --> 41:20.100
It's a good email, but my throat hurts a lot.

41:20.100 --> 41:24.100
I will post it on the forums and link it in the chat room.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.100
Long email is long.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.100
Yes.

41:27.100 --> 41:28.100
Long email is very long.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.100
Long email is long.

41:29.100 --> 41:33.100
If you want to send us long emails, mailbag at OrangeDownsRadio.com

41:33.100 --> 41:35.100
Meantime, more gaming news.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.100
Yes, Loki?

41:36.100 --> 41:37.100
Yes.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.100
Um.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.100
I was just reading something else that's kind of interesting.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.100
But this is sort of interesting.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.100
It'd be more interesting if it weren't the end gauge.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.100
But yes.

41:45.100 --> 41:47.100
Ear taco.

41:47.100 --> 41:53.100
Metal Gear Solid Mobile has somehow found its way on the end gauge.

41:53.100 --> 41:54.100
That's right.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.100
You will be able to play Metal Gear Solid.

41:57.100 --> 42:02.100
The winner of two 2007 International Mobile Gaming Awards.

42:02.100 --> 42:11.100
And apparently it's coming to the end gauge shortly after the launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 for the PS3.

42:11.100 --> 42:15.100
So that's cool I guess.

42:15.100 --> 42:20.100
At least they're getting some actual big name games.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.100
The end gauge is still around.

42:22.100 --> 42:25.100
Yeah.

42:25.100 --> 42:28.100
Well, do you remember Nolan Bushnell?

42:28.100 --> 42:29.100
I hope you do.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.100
Yes, because he gave us Pizza Time Theater.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.100
Yes.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.100
And Chuck E. Cheese.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.100
Right?

42:34.100 --> 42:35.100
That was Pizza Time Theater.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.100
Well, whatever.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.100
The name better.

42:37.100 --> 42:38.100
And Pong.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.100
Pizza Time Theater.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.100
Right?

42:40.100 --> 42:41.100
Yes.

42:41.100 --> 42:47.100
Well, he apparently was speaking at the Wedbush Morgan Securities Annual Management Access Conference.

42:47.100 --> 42:51.100
And he's saying the game piracy, it's on its way out.

42:51.100 --> 42:59.100
It says, quote, there is a stealth encryption chip called the TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now.

42:59.100 --> 43:06.100
What that says is that in the games business we will be able to encrypt with an absolutely verifiable private key in the encryption world,

43:06.100 --> 43:14.100
which is uncrackable by people on the internet, and by giving away passwords which will allow for a huge market to develop in some of the areas where piracy has been a real problem.

43:14.100 --> 43:15.100
It's not going to work.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.100
Why is that?

43:16.100 --> 43:18.100
Because everything can be cracked.

43:18.100 --> 43:21.100
And the fact that you said that it can't be cracked is just going to make people want to crack it.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.100
It is an invitation to the crackers to say please crack this.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.100
Trust me.

43:24.100 --> 43:27.100
If it can be modified, it will be modified on the board.

43:27.100 --> 43:30.100
Or they'll find a way to emulate it and they'll just disable it.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.100
There are ways to do everything.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.100
It has been done before.

43:34.100 --> 43:39.100
What I did think was interesting is that he does say, though, that movies and music, though, that's unstoppable.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.100
Quote, if you can watch it and you can hear it, you can copy it.

43:41.100 --> 43:45.100
He says games are a different thing because games are so integrated with the code.

43:45.100 --> 43:49.100
The TPM will, in fact, absolutely stop piracy of gameplay.

43:49.100 --> 43:57.100
As soon as the installed base of the TPM hardware chip gets large enough, we will start to see revenues coming from Asia and India at a time when before it didn't make sense.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.100
Or they'll just stop buying games altogether.

44:00.100 --> 44:06.100
Of course he wants to say that it can't be cracked because he wants to sell it to, you know, said companies that make motherboards.

44:06.100 --> 44:10.100
Obviously they want to do that because, you know, ideally it should work.

44:10.100 --> 44:16.100
But the problem is people out there want to steal games more than, you know...

44:16.100 --> 44:19.100
I mean, look at this. Okay, put it this way.

44:19.100 --> 44:27.100
There are games out there now that have it, you know, where you have to play it, you know, and it talks to a server online to validate that it's an official copy of the game.

44:27.100 --> 44:29.100
Those have been cracked.

44:29.100 --> 44:34.100
You know, there's stuff on the PSP that they've had countless firmware upgrades that are supposed to prevent piracy and stuff.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.100
Those have all been cracked.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.100
I mean, what makes...

44:37.100 --> 44:43.100
Rama in chat, chat.orangesonshooter.com says, Intel tried that with their Pentium 3 chips and boards. It didn't work.

44:43.100 --> 44:51.100
Yeah, I mean, it's a nice attempt and, you know, people should be a little bit more legit with stuff, but it's just not gonna happen.

44:51.100 --> 44:54.100
It really isn't, so...

44:54.100 --> 44:56.100
I don't know.

44:56.100 --> 45:00.100
Just because you stop people from pirating a game does not mean that they are gonna go buy your game.

45:00.100 --> 45:02.100
That's the other problem too.

45:02.100 --> 45:09.100
Because they're assuming that people that are pirating these things had intended to buy it in the first place.

45:09.100 --> 45:10.100
That's not always the case.

45:10.100 --> 45:14.100
That's a good point. I think a lot of pirates probably wouldn't even bother buying the games.

45:14.100 --> 45:16.100
I really think that.

45:16.100 --> 45:22.100
But it sounds like maybe he's trying to combat piracy in other countries, not necessarily just the US, but where it's way more rampant.

45:22.100 --> 45:24.100
You think that might be the case?

45:24.100 --> 45:33.100
Good luck. I mean, but, you know, if anything, you know, the Chinese and stuff, they've gotten piracy down big time, so...

45:33.100 --> 45:37.100
I don't see this affecting much.

45:37.100 --> 45:45.100
Alright, well, I don't know about you guys, but I get the feeling we've heard this all before, and when I hear things and I don't see results, I get irritated.

45:45.100 --> 46:03.100
And when I get irritated, we do the FUs of the week.

46:03.100 --> 46:05.100
FU to the dollar store.

46:05.100 --> 46:09.100
We went to get a USB cable, and there were none out on the shelf.

46:09.100 --> 46:15.100
The whole supply of them wasn't there, so I asked if someone would go and look in the back and see if there were any.

46:15.100 --> 46:19.100
Just about any other store I go to, people are willing to look in the back and just, oh, we don't have any.

46:19.100 --> 46:21.100
That was it.

46:21.100 --> 46:22.100
Loki.

46:22.100 --> 46:27.100
FU to the virtual friends in Grand Theft Auto IV.

46:27.100 --> 46:33.100
I don't want to go do activities with you. That's why I'm not calling you back, you idiots.

46:33.100 --> 46:35.100
But at least they have sleep mode.

46:35.100 --> 46:36.100
You do know it's a video game, right?

46:36.100 --> 46:41.100
Yes, it's still annoying, though, when you have people going, I haven't heard from you forever, I want to go drinking.

46:41.100 --> 46:45.100
It's like, fuck that, I have to shoot pigeons.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.100
So they don't understand.

46:47.100 --> 46:57.100
My FU of the week goes to the antibiotic C-Pro, which I was taking because the doctor thought I had an infection, even though I'm pretty sure I had a virus based on the high fever I had and the fact that the antibiotics didn't really work.

46:57.100 --> 47:06.100
But I was taking it for so long that finally my chest started to tighten up and I got a big ol' red rash on my chest, so I stopped taking it.

47:06.100 --> 47:10.100
Because that's not a good reaction to have, especially when you just have pancreatitis.

47:10.100 --> 47:12.100
So I chose to stop taking it.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.100
So FU to C-Pro.

47:14.100 --> 47:16.100
Drunami.

47:16.100 --> 47:22.100
FU to friends, so-called friends who make their mission in life to bring your ass down.

47:22.100 --> 47:24.100
I'm not naming names.

47:24.100 --> 47:27.100
No one, anyone here would know.

47:27.100 --> 47:33.100
FU to rock band and all its goodness for making my throat hurt like hell.

47:33.100 --> 47:36.100
And...

47:36.100 --> 47:38.100
FU to Mellow Gear Solid 2.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.100
Stop busting me.

47:40.100 --> 47:41.100
Alright.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.100
Just because I suck.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.100
Chiaraara.

47:44.100 --> 47:46.100
Anything you want to say FU to?

47:46.100 --> 47:47.100
I'm good, thanks.

47:47.100 --> 47:48.100
Aw.

47:48.100 --> 47:50.100
FU to you for being so happy.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.100
Yeah, really, we're jealous.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.100
I know, what's your secret?

47:53.100 --> 47:54.100
Alright.

47:54.100 --> 47:56.100
That's gonna do it for the FUs of the Week.

47:56.100 --> 47:59.100
Let's get back into some gaming news.

47:59.100 --> 48:01.100
DarkSakura's gonna take it.

48:01.100 --> 48:02.100
Well, she's coughing.

48:02.100 --> 48:04.100
I just wanted to ask, are you sure you didn't have anthrax?

48:04.100 --> 48:06.100
Because C-Pro is what they give you if you have anthrax.

48:06.100 --> 48:07.100
For real, huh?

48:07.100 --> 48:09.100
No, I do not have anthrax, thank gosh.

48:09.100 --> 48:11.100
I do have an anthrax CD somewhere.

48:11.100 --> 48:14.100
Did you start developing the rash, like, as soon as you started taking it?

48:14.100 --> 48:15.100
No, it was about five days into it.

48:15.100 --> 48:16.100
Five days into it?

48:16.100 --> 48:17.100
Yeah.

48:17.100 --> 48:18.100
Of course you didn't have anthrax.

48:18.100 --> 48:19.100
It does suck.

48:19.100 --> 48:20.100
It does suck.

48:20.100 --> 48:24.100
But I've been to the doctor so much in the past two months, I couldn't go back over the rash.

48:24.100 --> 48:26.100
I was just like, you know what, I feel fine, I'm just not gonna take it.

48:26.100 --> 48:30.100
I have some drug stuff to talk to you about after the show, too, because I know drug stuff.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.100
Yay, drugs!

48:32.100 --> 48:33.100
Drugs are rad.

48:33.100 --> 48:34.100
Yeah!

48:34.100 --> 48:35.100
Alright.

48:35.100 --> 48:37.100
There's a new Pokemon game coming out.

48:37.100 --> 48:39.100
Yay.

48:39.100 --> 48:43.100
This is like the scene where they say, and they ate Robin's minstrels and there was much rejoicing,

48:43.100 --> 48:45.100
and they just go, yay.

48:45.100 --> 48:46.100
Yay.

48:46.100 --> 48:47.100
Yeah.

48:47.100 --> 48:54.100
Koto Koto magazine said out word that there's going to be Pokemon Platinum,

48:54.100 --> 49:01.100
and it's supposed to be a companion to Diamond and Pearl.

49:01.100 --> 49:03.100
So, yay.

49:03.100 --> 49:06.100
Pokemon, colors we haven't thought of yet.

49:06.100 --> 49:11.100
I still like my Pokemans, but I have a feeling this will be just emerald all over again.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.100
Pokemon's a good game.

49:13.100 --> 49:18.100
I don't know, Platinum sounds like, I don't know.

49:18.100 --> 49:23.100
I can't help but think of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

49:23.100 --> 49:31.100
I played Pokemon Pearl for a while, but I only played it at the gym while I was riding the recumbent bike.

49:31.100 --> 49:39.100
So, apparently the casting has, or some rumors about casting have come out about the Prince of Persia movie,

49:39.100 --> 49:45.100
and Jake Gyllenhaal is now reported to be the Prince of Persia.

49:45.100 --> 49:47.100
Wow, that's so Persian.

49:47.100 --> 49:50.100
I know, totally.

49:50.100 --> 49:54.100
Dude, Bubble Boy is the Prince of Persia, that's pretty awesome.

49:54.100 --> 49:57.100
Bubble Boy was on TV the other day.

49:57.100 --> 50:00.100
I've watched that way too many times.

50:00.100 --> 50:03.100
But, yeah, I don't know.

50:03.100 --> 50:07.100
I can't be too excited about this.

50:07.100 --> 50:09.100
He just looks too lethargic, I'm sorry.

50:09.100 --> 50:18.100
He's just very like, I have to act.

50:18.100 --> 50:21.100
As long as it's hot, like Brokeback Mountain, then we're fine.

50:21.100 --> 50:24.100
I can't quit you, Prince of Persia.

50:24.100 --> 50:26.100
Excuse me, a baking powder.

50:26.100 --> 50:32.100
Speaking of video game movies, $200 million.

50:32.100 --> 50:40.100
$200 million variety reports, Crystal Sky Pictures has signed this deal for $200 million financing,

50:40.100 --> 50:46.100
and what this millions of dollars is going to be used, it's going to fund Castlevania,

50:46.100 --> 50:52.100
a sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled, and Pac-Man, the movie.

50:52.100 --> 50:58.100
So they're making Stranglehold the game, the movie, and then the game, because it'll come back around again.

50:58.100 --> 51:00.100
What a horrible night to have a movie.

51:00.100 --> 51:05.100
Now, look, we know that Castlevania has been, like, this has been off and on with Rider Strike and everything.

51:05.100 --> 51:12.100
We know this was on the table, but seriously, Pac-Man, the movie, like, how in the hell is that going to work?

51:12.100 --> 51:15.100
I mean, Pac-Man did have a TV show.

51:15.100 --> 51:16.100
He's a trap act.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.100
It was a cartoon. I guess if Pac-Man's a cartoon, it might work.

51:18.100 --> 51:19.100
It's a dumb idea.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.100
He's a pill popper.

51:20.100 --> 51:26.100
It's a dumb idea, although we did throw around the premise of a Pac-Man movie.

51:26.100 --> 51:37.100
One man in the future will save the world from Inky, Binky, and Clyde using dots.

51:37.100 --> 51:39.100
Why are you talking like Triple H?

51:39.100 --> 51:40.100
No, they...

51:40.100 --> 51:41.100
It's the movie man.

51:41.100 --> 51:47.100
No, what you would do is you would have a cop on the edge, you know, played by...

51:47.100 --> 51:48.100
Oh, God, the guy...

51:48.100 --> 51:49.100
Joe Pesci.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.100
No, not Joe Pesci.

51:50.100 --> 51:54.100
No, that'd be funny, though, but...

51:54.100 --> 51:55.100
He knew too much.

51:55.100 --> 51:56.100
No, no.

51:56.100 --> 51:59.100
Now the ghosts of his past are after him.

51:59.100 --> 52:00.100
Ah, Gerardimo wins.

52:00.100 --> 52:04.100
He says the Pac-Man movie will have Kylie Minogue as Ms. Pac-Man and it'll be awesome.

52:04.100 --> 52:05.100
That's a good point.

52:05.100 --> 52:09.100
Lame.

52:09.100 --> 52:10.100
Do not want...

52:10.100 --> 52:18.100
Do not want...

52:18.100 --> 52:22.100
Dark Sakura, what could they possibly do a Pac-Man movie about?

52:22.100 --> 52:23.100
Have you ever seen the cartoon from the 80s?

52:23.100 --> 52:24.100
Is there anything?

52:24.100 --> 52:27.100
I think the cartoon from the 80s was great and there was Pac-Land.

52:27.100 --> 52:31.100
Unless there was only one feasible way I could see this happening, right?

52:31.100 --> 52:34.100
And it would not be a movie that they would be able to promote very well.

52:34.100 --> 52:39.100
Is if they did a Pac-Man porno where they dressed everybody up in ridiculous costumes and made them have sex.

52:39.100 --> 52:41.100
That's the only way this could work.

52:41.100 --> 52:46.100
It's scary, but it's the only feasible way this could possibly work.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.100
Not sure if want.

52:47.100 --> 52:56.100
We reached out to Atari for comment on the Pac-Man movie and this is all they had to say.

52:56.100 --> 52:59.100
Too bad it's Namco that's going to be taking care of that.

52:59.100 --> 53:01.100
I...my theory...

53:01.100 --> 53:02.100
It's a joke from like three weeks ago.

53:02.100 --> 53:03.100
I know it is.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.100
That was for the fans.

53:04.100 --> 53:05.100
Wow.

53:05.100 --> 53:06.100
I miss the bus.

53:06.100 --> 53:12.100
I miss the bus, sorry.

53:12.100 --> 53:13.100
What?

53:13.100 --> 53:15.100
I feel it's going to be CG.

53:15.100 --> 53:16.100
Probably.

53:16.100 --> 53:17.100
Okay.

53:17.100 --> 53:20.100
I feel it's going to be poop.

53:20.100 --> 53:24.100
It's going to be a pooped out rubber band.

53:24.100 --> 53:25.100
You know what?

53:25.100 --> 53:30.100
You need to take that toilet paper joke book, turn it upside down.

53:30.100 --> 53:31.100
I'm not going to say it.

53:31.100 --> 53:32.100
You know, if...

53:32.100 --> 53:35.100
Turn it upside down and turn that smith front.

53:35.100 --> 53:45.100
SSJ100Matt says that Jessica Alba should be Mrs. Pac-Man, but that makes me think that all games, Jessica, if she doesn't get the role in that horror movie, she should make Ms. Pac-Man her next goal.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.100
Come on.

53:46.100 --> 53:47.100
I'm only recycling your material.

53:47.100 --> 53:48.100
Come on.

53:48.100 --> 53:52.100
If she doesn't win that, don't you think she's suffered enough?

53:52.100 --> 53:55.100
I don't know.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.100
All right.

53:58.100 --> 53:59.100
More news, please.

53:59.100 --> 54:00.100
Rob.

54:00.100 --> 54:01.100
Can I have news?

54:01.100 --> 54:02.100
No, you can't.

54:02.100 --> 54:04.100
You can have...okay.

54:04.100 --> 54:12.100
Well, for people who give a shit, and I'm not one of them, Postal's coming to Blu-ray in August.

54:12.100 --> 54:16.100
Postal is that movie made by...what's his name?

54:16.100 --> 54:19.100
Who did a bunch of shitty movies?

54:19.100 --> 54:20.100
Uwe Boll.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.100
Yeah, he sucks.

54:21.100 --> 54:24.100
Sadly enough, I have this preordered already.

54:24.100 --> 54:25.100
You do?

54:25.100 --> 54:27.100
Why are you putting money in his pocket?

54:27.100 --> 54:31.100
Loki just really wants to see Dave Foley's penis in high definition.

54:31.100 --> 54:32.100
Don't you know it?

54:32.100 --> 54:33.100
Totally.

54:33.100 --> 54:37.100
No, actually, this movie looks so bad that I have to add it to my bad movie collection.

54:37.100 --> 54:38.100
Yeah, it does look pretty bad.

54:38.100 --> 54:52.100
To read the, I guess, synopsis of the movie, it's about a misfit who sets out to rob his local amusement park while getting mixed up with a faction of the Taliban.

54:52.100 --> 54:54.100
I'm sorry, what?

54:54.100 --> 54:55.100
Yeah.

54:55.100 --> 54:59.100
It grossed less than five million.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.100
Well, it's only in four theaters.

55:01.100 --> 55:03.100
It grossed less than five dollars.

55:03.100 --> 55:05.100
Which is a really nice way of saying that it made...

55:05.100 --> 55:09.100
How did it even make five million? Are you sure it's not five thousand?

55:09.100 --> 55:14.100
Well, first off, it just came out. I mean, literally this week, so...

55:14.100 --> 55:16.100
We wish it would go back.

55:16.100 --> 55:21.100
I don't know. I'd see it. But, see, because this looks actually semi-interesting to me.

55:21.100 --> 55:26.100
I've watched an Uwe Boll movie before, the BloodRayne 2 movie.

55:26.100 --> 55:29.100
Interesting premise. Execution was shit.

55:29.100 --> 55:31.100
Loki, you're part of the problem.

55:31.100 --> 55:37.100
Hey, I had to watch it in order to talk to Uwe Boll, okay? We interviewed him. That was fun.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.100
You're part of the reason he keeps making this shit.

55:39.100 --> 55:44.100
Hey, I didn't actually pay to see this movie. It was a screener.

55:44.100 --> 55:47.100
But, yeah, I get to talk to him. It was cool.

55:47.100 --> 55:50.100
He's making a game, too, by the way.

55:50.100 --> 55:52.100
It's Tunnel Rat.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.100
Hooray.

55:54.100 --> 56:01.100
No, it's about, like, these guys that are in Vietnam and they go into the vehicle.

56:01.100 --> 56:03.100
Oh, dude, Tunnel Rat was the name of the G.I. Joe.

56:03.100 --> 56:08.100
Yeah, probably named for the same reason, but, yeah.

56:08.100 --> 56:10.100
Talk about another movie that's gonna suck.

56:10.100 --> 56:16.100
I was trying to see how much Postal made over the weekend, but it's not even on the top ten. Surprise.

56:16.100 --> 56:18.100
I'm trying to think where we go to see that.

56:18.100 --> 56:20.100
I looked at Box Office Mojo. I couldn't find it.

56:20.100 --> 56:25.100
But I'm looking now for the Rotten Tomatoes score. Eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes for Postal.

56:25.100 --> 56:30.100
IMDB sometimes has the actual, like, disease.

56:30.100 --> 56:34.100
It has four screens. I mean, it can't do very- it's probably gonna do a million.

56:34.100 --> 56:40.100
I'm looking at- not even that. I'm looking at positive reviews for Postal. Let's see.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.100
Prairie Miller from News Blaze says,

56:42.100 --> 56:50.100
Along the way to its parking lot showdown, a wacky property damage conspiracy to commit insurance fraud is uncovered between Osama and Bush.

56:50.100 --> 56:56.100
The darker, zany recesses of America is viewed from the Twilight Zone. Move over, Barat.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.100
What?

56:57.100 --> 57:00.100
Let's see. Here's another positive review from Cam Williams.

57:00.100 --> 57:06.100
I suppose since almost seven years have passed since 9-11, America might finally be ready to laugh at the tragedy.

57:06.100 --> 57:10.100
Tasteless, profane, and far-fetched, but undeniably funny, too.

57:10.100 --> 57:13.100
Dot, dot, dot. That's all I have to say.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.100
Film Threat, Jeremy Knox.

57:15.100 --> 57:22.100
It's not perfect and will get on the nerves of the more opinionated critics out there, but it's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.

57:22.100 --> 57:24.100
Dot, dot, fucking dot.

57:24.100 --> 57:28.100
Those are the three positive reviews, giving it an eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes right now.

57:28.100 --> 57:31.100
I do have to admit, the poster is pretty funny.

57:31.100 --> 57:36.100
I mean, it's offensive. It's highly offensive, but it's mildly amusing.

57:36.100 --> 57:46.100
Alright. So, some interesting news. We've been hearing a lot of different publishers dropping out of both E3 and the ESA.

57:46.100 --> 57:52.100
Well, there's another one dropping out of the ESA, and I think they're already out of E3, so it's not a big surprise there.

57:52.100 --> 57:57.100
But id Software has actually dropped out of the ESA as well.

57:57.100 --> 58:07.100
And they're joined, of course, with LucasArts, Activision, and Vividi. Or Activision Blizzard, which I still don't understand why they're still referring to them as two different companies.

58:07.100 --> 58:09.100
But, whatever.

58:09.100 --> 58:17.100
And it's unclear what their decision, why they decided to drop out of the ESA, but we do know that they're gone.

58:17.100 --> 58:23.100
So, apparently, one more out the door. Interesting.

58:23.100 --> 58:27.100
Any theories why this is happening, Logan?

58:27.100 --> 58:36.100
I don't know. Maybe they just don't feel like ESA is representing them enough, or maybe they're just getting cheap and they don't want to pay the money to the ESA to help defend them.

58:36.100 --> 58:42.100
And besides, I mean, think about it this way. It's like they're defending the game industry, okay?

58:42.100 --> 58:45.100
And anybody that's joined up with the ESA has to pay them to defend the game industry.

58:45.100 --> 58:51.100
Well, if you drop out of the ESA, they're still defending you, so it's like you're getting a free ride.

58:51.100 --> 58:56.100
Robin Chat says the ESA business seems to be the beginning of a new consortium.

58:56.100 --> 58:59.100
I don't know. It sounded pretty gay to me.

58:59.100 --> 59:02.100
Why did you say that?

59:02.100 --> 59:06.100
I mean, they're just freeloading on this shit.

59:06.100 --> 59:20.100
Well, that's just my opinion on why they're, I mean, it makes perfect business sense if, you know, okay, well, I can eliminate this cost and they're still doing the work for me, so, as unethical as it is, eh, whatever.

59:20.100 --> 59:26.100
Well, speaking of things that are pretty gay, Xbox Live has been going on a banning marathon lately.

59:26.100 --> 59:29.100
A couple of bannings recently have caught some attention.

59:29.100 --> 59:34.100
The Gayer Gamer was a gamertag that got banned recently.

59:34.100 --> 59:42.100
Also, this gamertag got banned. Richard Gaywood was a gamertag that got banned, and you might be thinking, ho ho ho, Gaywood.

59:42.100 --> 59:45.100
There's actually a street near here. It's Gaywood Street.

59:45.100 --> 59:46.100
Dick Gaywood.

59:46.100 --> 59:50.100
Here's the thing. His name is really Richard Gaywood.

59:50.100 --> 59:51.100
His parents apparently hate him.

59:51.100 --> 59:55.100
There's actually a scan of, no, that's the last name. You don't get to pick your last name.

59:55.100 --> 59:59.100
There's actually a scan of his driver's license up on the internet. His name was Richard Gaywood.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:07.100
Now, why you would want to use your name as your gamertag is beyond me, but granted, did Xbox overreact?

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.100
Some gay themed websites chimed in on this.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:18.100
Lesbian Gamer said, I've taken a few deep breaths, run this story over in my mind again and again, and yet still return to the same annoying factor.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:25.100
Why does gay automatically equate to sex or of a sexual nature and carry with it such negative and deviant overtones?

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:34.100
I can understand Microsoft is trying to protect users, but perhaps there needs to be some table debate as to what they're protecting whom from and what they're perpetuating in the process.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.100
Linking gay to some negative or sexually explicit content merely fans the fires of homophobia.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:48.100
Gay Gamer said this, I'm somewhat on the fence with the issue, having played many MMORPGs and seeing the many annoying and disturbing names that can come from the idle minds on the internets.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.100
And it seems as if Microsoft is putting up the normal, we can't make exceptions defense.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:01:00.100
All of this, however, is greatly outweighed by the fact that it is given name, and despite the connotations it may carry with it, he lives with that name every day.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:06.100
And I'm sure you've probably been wondering what I, the gay host of Orange Laund Radio, have to say on this subject.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:14.100
And honestly, you want my honest opinion on this subject? We have much bigger things to worry about in life than this.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:23.100
For instance, they are going to try and overturn the recent gay marriage thing that was passed in the state of California by the Supreme Court.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:27.100
Finally have allowed gay marriage to happen in the state in less than 30 days.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.100
And the crazies are going to try and put it on the November ballot.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:36.100
And according to recent polls, 54% of Californians would vote for it to overturn gay marriage.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:42.100
Because, yeah, suddenly you're going to let gays marry and there's going to be like this just sudden fuckwave going through the state.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.100
And everybody's going to start fucking everywhere because that's what happens when you let gays get married.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.100
Next thing you know, cats marry dogs and up is down.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:54.100
Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria. Stupid.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:02:00.100
So, you know what I have to say? The hell with Xbox Live. It's their service. They can do whatever they want.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.100
I mean, yeah, it's a little asinine, but whatever.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.100
Rob, I have a question.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.100
We have more important things to worry about right now.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.100
Yes?

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:13.100
If gay marriage is allowed, wouldn't that like lower the amount of gay sex that's happening?

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.100
You know, because once you get married you stop having sex.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.100
Yeah, it really would.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.100
She has a point.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:23.100
So, you know, that would be good for the, you know, the right wing if, you know, gay marriage was allowed.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.100
Welcome to the Olive Garden Roundtable.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:32.100
That and there would be a lot more economic growth for all of the gay men registering.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:39.100
I loved what Ellen said. I'm sorry to get political on this show, but for obvious reasons this is something I feel very, very strongly in.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.100
It won't be the last time I say something about it. It's a deal.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.100
Okay.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.100
Do you see any of this protesting?

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100
No, I know. I know.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:50.100
But I love what Ellen said to John McCain is that she said something about, she compared it to, and it's really like this,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:56.100
is that you say there's two chairs over there and you can sit in one but you can't sit in the other.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.100
Why not? You just can't.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.100
That's what it feels like. Think about it.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.100
All right.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.100
That's it. I am against chair marriage as well.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.100
That's just wrong.

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.100
What will you do without you?

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:19.100
I honestly, I think that the best, one of the best, and I'm sure a lot of people know by now I'm a big fan of the show Bullshit.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:24.100
Watch the episode about gay marriage and polyamory. Seriously.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.100
Thank God for the youth of America because I seriously think I'm probably preaching to the choir, most people of this show.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.100
I mean I know we have tons and tons of heterosexual people that listen to this show that probably listen to this and go,

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.100
what's the big freaking deal?

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.100
That's what we're saying. That's all we're saying. What's the big freaking deal?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.100
Because people have the religious corn cob up their ass.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.100
That's a lot less comfortable than other things to be up their ass for.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:51.100
I'll tell you what, there's a million other things we're going to hell for before gay marriage, I'll tell you that.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.100
Anyhow, moving on.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.100
People are stupid.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.100
Please get me off my political tangent.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.100
I'll take the soapbox out from under you.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:06.100
Well how about we speak of our common nemesis that we have with the rest of the video game community.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:10.100
Now everyone can agree, no matter what, everyone can agree.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.100
He who shall not be named.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.100
That this guy's a moron.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.100
I'm going to say his name so that I can read this headline, which is wonderful.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:25.100
Jack Thompson, guilty man, 27 of 31 misconduct charges recommended by judge.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.100
There's a lovely picture under this on the distorted article.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.100
He said his name.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:35.100
This is karma, you dump it, you drink it.

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.100
Lovely.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:47.100
Yeah, so basically dude is on, dude's guilty for fucking up.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.100
Did Jack Thompson jump up and go, objection.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.100
No, because he's not that.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.100
Overruled, bitch.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:59.100
I, the day that he is completely, what's the word, disbarred.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:05.100
I am going to, what's something awesome.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.100
Dude, when Jack Thompson is disbarred, I might dress up as Tingle.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.100
Do it.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.100
Shit.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.100
He just said he might.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.100
No, they're having the results of the disbarring trial on June 4th.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:23.100
So it is, you know, like, I didn't say I would, I said I might.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.100
Yes, you did.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.100
You said you would.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.100
I said I might.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.100
No takes.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.100
It says might.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.100
What did this June 4th fall on?

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.100
We will be live on Wednesday.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.100
No, I'm kidding.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100
If they let us.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100
We will record live.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.100
Where would I get a Tingle outfit?

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.100
Where would I even get that?

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.100
We will make.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.100
Okay.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.100
You know what?

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.100
What?

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.100
You'll bring back Dr. Dick.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.100
We'll see.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.100
And, or Mr. Spanky.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:56.100
There will be celebration of some sort happening when, when Lord Voldemort is disbarred.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:02.100
I think that's, and on top of that, we need to send a letter to Ice Cube.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.100
Wiki this, please.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.100
Why?

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.100
No, it wasn't Ice Cube.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.100
It was Ice T.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.100
Why?

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:12.100
Because, um, Fuckhead got him back in the, um, nineties for his album.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.100
Remember?

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.100
Oh, yes.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100
Because his big thing was music.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.100
And then he moved from music to video games.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:22.100
All this guy wants is to have the world lick his ass, not kiss it, lick it.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.100
Licking is far more disgusting.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.100
All right.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.100
We're going to be opening up the Skypline very soon.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.100
Let's pay Politary to do that.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.100
Well, it sounds just like you're singing.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.100
1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:43.100
But first, one more story that's not about Lord Voldemort or Tingle dressing.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.100
Yes.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.100
And this is not a bad story, actually.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:52.100
Um, there's going to be some Japanese songs that may be hitting rock band very soon, actually.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:07:02.100
Um, apparently, um, a harmonics developer, uh, told Joystick during a rock band's party in New York City,

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:07.100
um, that they will be seeing some Japanese rock music in the games.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:13.100
Um, apparently they were supposed to be, there should be an announcement coming soon, but who knows?

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:17.100
Maybe, uh, some stuff like TM Revolution, uh, Malice Miser.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.100
What would you like to see?

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.100
The Pillows?

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.100
Guitar Wolf.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.100
Malice Miser's so old.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.100
What's her name?

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.100
The crazy chick.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.100
Kana?

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.100
Kana?

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.100
Yeah.

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100
I don't know that she's doing anything anymore.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.100
That's too bad.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.100
Kana's crazy, though.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.100
Guitar Wolf.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.100
They need Guitar Wolf.

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.100
Bees.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.100
But...

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.100
But Bass Wolf is dead.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.100
Did they replace...?

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.100
Gacked.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.100
Gacked.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.100
Maybe.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.100
Bees.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.100
Definitely.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100
There you go.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100
Here...

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.100
Yeah, they'd probably have Smop or something.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.100
Listen.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100
This is what Activision needs to do, okay?

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.100
If you want to make an actual game that's going to be something that stands out from

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.980
all these other music games out there, you make the official Guitar Wolf game.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.100
You have it be an action game with music playing in there as well.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.100
Zombies.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.100
With zombies.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.100
And you fight zombies with your, uh, awesome guitar skills.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100
Ooh!

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100
This is a good game here.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.100
So you would fight zombies with your guitar and you're a Japanese rock star.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.660
It'd probably, though, have, um, like, um...

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.740
That's almost like Revolution X, but cooler.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.020
So I don't really...

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.020
Dream games make it so.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.020
No, I don't know.

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.020
No, we already had a dream game tonight.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:17.860
There's a few, um, I guess more, I would say obscure rock bands that I wouldn't mind hearing

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860
there.

01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.860
Like O'Miele's, uh...

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.420
They're going to have, uh, Brutal Legend.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.660
That one with Jack Blackday is going to be, uh, Roadie.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.380
They fight, you know, zombies and, like, all sorts of, like, uh, bumping chicken.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.380
I still have your copy of Wild Zero.

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:31.680
I was wondering where that was.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.680
It's in my house.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.680
Oh, okay.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.680
All right, we're going to open up the Skypline.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.020
1-8-7-7 GAMEOLR.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.380
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.900
We only have time for a couple calls tonight, so we're going to try to keep this short and

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.900
keep the calls short, too.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:45.900
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:46.900
Who's this?

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.900
Hey, hey, hey.

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.140
It's now level 30 DJ Rama S. It's not Zaku.

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.900
Why level 30 Rama S?

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.260
I just surveyed my big level 30 this past weekend, and I am sober.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.260
Congrats.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.260
Whoa.

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:04.260
Oh, you're having the same birthday that I'm having next month.

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.420
Oh, yeah.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.380
Well, congrats to you.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.500
Congrats on your ding, man.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.500
Thank you.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.740
What else is on your mind besides that you're old?

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.340
Um, I finally got my Xbox 360.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.060
Ooh, what'd you think?

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.060
I kind of wish I'd gotten it sooner, but I'm pretty happy with it, and I have to thank

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.380
Loki because he's been randy about Saints Row and Crackdown.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.660
I actually picked them up.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:27.660
Nice.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.340
They're like dirt cheap now, so.

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:32.100
Yeah, and I'm enjoying it.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.260
Crackdown is really, Crackdown is a great game.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.700
What made you finally, what finally broke you into getting an Xbox 360?

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.060
What was it that finally made you go, yes, I need this?

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:46.980
Because we already have a Wii in the house, and what's left is the PS3 and the Xbox 360.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:51.580
And there's one thing that the Xbox 360 has that the PS3 does not.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.020
Which is?

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.100
Games that I'd actually play.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.460
There you have it.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.300
So what other games did you get besides the two that Loki had recommended?

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.820
Finally we went out and got Rock Band.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.580
Of course, nice.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.740
I picked up a copy of Rumble Roses XX.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.220
Nice.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.900
And we have Bioshock, oh my god, that game is awesome.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900
It is very awesome.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.100
Do you have an HDTV to play all this on?

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.100
32 inch.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.100
Very sexy.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.820
Oh yeah.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820
Very sexy.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.180
So we'll have to jam on Rock Band sometime, add me to your friends list.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.180
I think I have room, I may not, I don't know.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:32.340
I hope so, because I will go check it, and I did download Yaris while y'all was on break.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.220
Wow, what'd you think?

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.340
I haven't played it yet, but this is the way I look at it.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.660
Free game is free.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.500
Free game is free, but free game is also a bit of a waste of time.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.500
What are you laughing at?

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500
I'm sorry.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.700
DarkSocker is being very distracting tonight, because she's laughing at something.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:51.020
She's showing us this YouTube video of a flying penis.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.380
I saw that, that was funny.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.700
Remember the penis age in Second Life?

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.700
This is real life.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:01.300
That is so stupid, and you guys are like, laughing.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.300
How old are you?

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.300
How old are you?

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300
Five?

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.300
Six?

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.300
It has to do with gaming.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.300
Alright, anyhow.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.940
Is it a chess champion speech?

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.060
I thought it was, yeah, they had that on Best Week Ever.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.060
I'm sorry, Rama, for that.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.780
Is there anything else you wanted to share besides the flying penis copter, as Act-Def

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.780
calls it?

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.780
No comment.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:21.780
Alright, take care, Rama.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.780
Alright, bye.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.780
Alright, bye.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.780
Bye.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:30.340
Stop distracting the show with your flying penises.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.940
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:33.940
But it's clock.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.940
It's GS68.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.940
GS68, what is on your mind, my friend?

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.940
Do you have a flying penis?

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.940
Are you a fan of me right now?

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.940
Yep.

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.100
Wait, hey, you gotta get some noise.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.940
Are you in the middle of a crowd or something?

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:54.220
Actually, no, I'm in the main area.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.220
You're in the main area?

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.180
Are there tons of people walking through there?

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.660
Over by the hall with the meeting rooms.

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.900
Dude, make a beeline to the vendor hall and make some noise for Orange Lawn's radio.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.900
Yeah, you gotta make some noise for Orange Lawn's radio.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.900
Alright, that's alright.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.100
What, what, how's it going this year?

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.100
That was fun to me.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100
What are we missing out on?

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.100
Let's see.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:23.340
This is the gaming room and dealer's room, for better or for worse, and dealer's room,

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:28.140
they have maximum two and three, for example, but it's $1.50 a game instead of $1.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:38.340
They have the, pretty much the same Bamaari from last year, they still, they have Pops

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:42.260
and there's going to be Fever, but they made it Adam L2 instead, which is awesome.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:46.220
Have there been any, any awesome panels this year to make up for the loss of Orange Lawn's

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.220
radio?

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:55.500
There's Bonzi Arcade, which is basically a game show where, also before, where you have

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:01.260
like video game children, sometimes you're challenged to like, do a third test in a video

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:06.340
game, like collect 25 rings and fight the hedgehog or beat the final boss of Sonic 2.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:07.340
Huh.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.340
Interesting.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.660
It sounds like you're having fun.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.980
What are some of the craziest cosplays you've seen while you've been there?

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:26.420
Let me see, let me think, um, there, there's one mecha cosplay, I forgot the name, but

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.980
he has some lights on his, I would say that was pretty cool.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.980
Hmm.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.980
Sounds good.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:37.180
I went to the hand-tack room for the heck of it.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:42.860
It was hilarious, like, like, like you're doing, I was doing like hand-tack and stuff

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:51.260
like that, and people were like, and the freaking stuff they were showing.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.260
Huh.

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.380
Well it sounds like you're having fun and you're going to continue to throughout the

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.420
rest of the weekend, so I'm sorry we didn't make it this year, but are there any OLR listeners

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.420
that you've run into?

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:06.860
Unfortunately, I appear to be the only one that I know of.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.940
Aw, sadness.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.220
Some of the staff listens to our show, I know they do.

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.220
Yeah.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:12.220
They're all closet fans.

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.220
Yeah.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:23.100
So, so on my DS, like, I sent my nickname to O-R-M-E-G-S-68, I went into the world with

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:29.620
use Mingle Mode and just walked around to that way, so people pass my DS, so when other

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:35.220
people in Mingle Mode pass by my DS, they'll see my name and, yeah.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.620
I like the grassroots effort to get the OLR name out there.

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.620
Very well done.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:40.620
Yeah.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:47.620
I had a little OLR circle flash logo, right?

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.620
Yeah?

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:55.500
Yeah, I think first thing I had it in my badge holder, because I had an oversized badge holder,

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.420
like it's big enough to carry a little card under my badge.

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:00.740
Oh, very cool.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:05.300
We should make, we should make little somethings for people that go to anime conventions.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.140
Ooh, I should look into that, like little stickers or something that people can wear.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.860
I thought I could check out the anime master last night, I didn't really like it.

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:19.300
Like, a lot of, like a lot of kids, they try too hard with the voice acting, so it's a

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:24.800
sounding cheated horror wonder to really dance kit, like, too many people doing that freaking

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.300
Haru Haru Yagai dance, I mean...

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:28.300
It's still good.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:31.300
I suppose.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:37.920
But they're pretty awesome more versus Capcom skit, where they, where they were the...

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:44.460
I think Ryou's Shinkou had broken a character, like they replicated that with like a, well,

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.860
a cellophane, which was pretty awesome.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.060
It looked like a laser, I guess.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.060
Huh.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:55.820
Well, it sounds like you're having a real good time at Fonome, so keep spreading the

01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:00.420
word and let us know, expect a full, full report next week.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:05.280
Also, we want to let you know, a good friend of OLR, Mel, he is apparently, Mel B is apparently

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.260
deejaying something on Sunday at 10 o'clock, so I don't know how long you're going to be

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:10.260
there.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.260
Excuse me?

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.580
Apparently Mel B is deejaying something tonight, in an hour, at 10 o'clock.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580
He's deejaying something.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.900
There must be some type of dance or something going on.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:17.900
Me too.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.900
Mel B, our buddy.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.980
Oh, Mel B, um, I don't really know him.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.780
Oh, well tell, he knows OLR.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.780
Oh, I see.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.780
All right.

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.180
We gotta let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but have fun.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:30.180
All right, bye.

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.180
Run around, act crazy.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.180
All right, see you around.

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.180
All right.

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.180
Take care.

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.180
See you around.

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:36.180
Thank you.

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.180
Thanks, buddy.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.180
All right, so we just got a call direct from Phonome.

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.180
It's kind of cool.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.580
I like these a whole little, like, live reports we're getting.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.980

Well, hello, SSJ100 Matt, the, um, winner of the OLR, uh, contest from a couple weeks

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.420
ago for the, uh, GTA IV console, and we heard that you got at least one vote from another

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.420
show, so that's good.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.420

01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:00.420

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:01.420
Things are looking good.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.420
So, what's up, buddy?

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:03.420
Nothing much.

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:06.900
that much well you know i just want to call in uh... but i want to thank

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.640
everyone who are voted uh... voted on my uh...

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:12.980
entry that would be everyone has to see one of us

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.460
yeah you

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.180
you are going to kick but not competition you did a great job

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:21.880
well you know i felt guilty cuz i know you guys call but i was i was on the

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.340
road i was on a car cross-country trips uh... it had we edited out of the

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.660
podcast they'll never know

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.940

games people like that and started uh...

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.240
very young and just go like that yes in the end they didn't vote for you but i

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.540
think it's because they didn't get it

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.160

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.260
uh...

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:43.060
that another one of the next my friend who he was coupling tension and i'm

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.060
supposed to be a

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.400
killing from the melancholy of her he says to me

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:52.060
i'm trying to figure out if this is you

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.140
we're trying to look at the pictures here oh yeah that looks like orange here

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:57.660
that's probably right there

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.660
very cool

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:03.340
though sounds like you have always are just like tons and tons of people there

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:05.180
or yeah i think that like that

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.320
fourth biggest convention in the united states or something like that that is an

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.580
awesome pyramid head out there with that

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.540
let's get here and a cosplay out of here with us in my head to the pictures

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.580
earlier uh...

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.620
very hot

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.480
uh... so i think what at what do you really did things to see their real

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.600
quick

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.260
uh... well i don't really get the play much because there is like huge lines

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.980
for all the games

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.980
but me of course with a huge station with all you play classic fighters like

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.740
street fighter and just like

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.000
goes on and on and then there's like brawl of course

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.340
uh...

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.960
correct your case that they had like

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.160
beat mania

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.540
six-part and

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:41.760
and then they have

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.000
the new one

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.620
gold

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.220
and i really get to play that because

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:50.260
i was wrong with the six max fishing i put in my quarters and they like ripped me off

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.440
i was just like dang it

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.660
they had an in the group two machine

01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.080
i think it had r twenty one or something because

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.540
it had this whole opening preview video that over four thousand five hundred

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.540
songs i'm just like holy shit and somebody probably installed

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:10.000
a hack on it

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
something but oh my god it was huge and then they had ddr extreme pump it up

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.960
sounds like fun

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.040
