14107	23620	Tonight, May 4th, 2008, some gaming companies drop out of this year's E3, Atari is getting bought, and is there actually a way to add storage to your
31536	35778	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35818	44083	We are that podcast on the internet and live talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44503	45824	My name is Rob Roberts.
45924	49626	Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49686	51047	She has the night off.
51527	56129	I actually happen to know that she is hanging out with one of the OLR lesbians tonight.
56149	60732	It's been a long time since we've had OLR lesbians on the show, but it's because...
61352	64834	Meg Z's back in Wisconsin and Chris is actually moving out to Wisconsin as well.
64894	68376	So we're sadly not going to have them on the show for quite a while after that.
68416	74520	But they're having their last, I guess, girly weekend or whatever girls do before Chris moves.
74920	77642	What do girls do, Rice Princess, who's joining us tonight?
77682	79203	A very special guest filling in tonight.
79443	80503	He goes shopping.
80623	81404	He goes shopping?
81424	81824	Yeah.
81984	82825	And talk about the lies?
82845	82925	Yeah.
83425	86047	I guess, but not if you're a lesbian, I guess.
86227	86507	I don't know.
86847	93071	Oh, then they do other things like, I don't know, chopping death.
94112	95152	Chopping wood and stuff.
95172	95773	Knock it off.
96433	99175	The smart-ass you hear over there is one and only Techmaster Loki.
100155	100696	How are you, Loki?
100856	103898	Good, except this cord is, like, attached to the...
104281	104761	I'll see you next time.
124127	125068	Yes, mustard.
125248	126208	What in the hell?
126389	128190	The show is completely disorganized tonight.
128530	129391	Delicious mustard.
129811	130171	I don't know.
130611	132673	First the mics are tangled, then you're spilling mustard on yourself.
132693	136095	Well, the problem is because she's sitting over here instead of sitting over in Jamie's abyss over there.
136155	140598	Because of that, I have to move this stupid thing around the chair.
140618	141699	I'll just scoot back.
141779	145061	We wanted to get her pretty little face on cam, even though the cam is kind of sucking tonight.
146102	147143	How you doing?
147483	147943	I'm fine.
149324	150445	Except I have mustard on me.
150525	153167	How was your week outside of the goddamn mustard?
154500	156162	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
173584	177806	You may remember them of the Shoes and Apparel website.
178647	180668	They have commercials now on TV and stuff.
181208	190032	So we went there, got the tour, and then we demoed games there, which I got to play quite a few of them because that's what I was doing is playing games.
192102	200228	And then basically, you know, just kind of teaching them the basics about games and stuff, just throwing some, like, facts out there for them, basically just to get them excited about games.
201369	202029	It was cool, though.
202049	207073	They had a DDR Supernova machine there, so I got to play that for a little bit.
209457	211999	and then, uh, what else did we play there?
212340	220888	We had, um, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue set up, which, I mean, that game looks good, but, you know, I just never was really interested in the Gran Turismo series, but it's pretty.
221188	221749	I'll give them that.
222670	229456	Um, and got to use nice dual shocks and stuff, so it fell all the rumbles, which, you know, I guess that's neat.
230757	231097	I don't know.
231478	231578	Um,
232997	240822	We also had set up Mario Kart Wii, so I finally used the Wii Wheel instead of just hucking it out the door.
240842	248087	To be honest, there's really hardly any difference between the Wii Wheel and just holding the controller sideways, and I hate it.
248487	249428	I absolutely hate it.
250228	251829	Call of Duty 4 Call of Duty 4
264824	267845	We had Grand Theft Auto 4 set up because I brought my copy actually with me.
267885	274588	I actually brought my 360 with me but ironically enough I didn't get a chance to actually play it in my hotel room at all.
275029	286834	So that kind of sucked but I did play it at the event and I had already memorized a lot of the cheat codes so I was just spawning helicopters and chopping people with the rotor blades and stuff and just fun stuff like that and people seemed to enjoy it.
286854	290516	Then we had Wii Sports being demoed and pretty much everything from that.
292216	292897	Smash Brothers
293997	297161	Once again, I had to play with the controller sideways, which I hate it.
299564	300345	And I think that's it.
300826	303669	So that's what we were demoing for them, and they really enjoyed it.
304510	305651	Great company, to be honest.
305692	310898	I'd work there tomorrow if I could, but they're all the way in Henderson, Nevada, and we're
311738	312819	All the way out here in Sacramento.
312919	314660	But shit, man.
315821	317942	If they were out here, absolutely awesome company.
318002	319263	Just everyone loved working there.
320024	322165	They cater lunch and breakfast every day.
322786	325448	They have vending machines full of stuff that's all free.
327149	331712	Just very fun going environment.
332469	337131	Well, since you were getting into your gaming week, why don't you tell us a little more about what other types of games you've been playing this week?
337151	337951	Anything outside of Vegas?
338691	338911	Yes.
339132	341112	Well, more Grand Theft Auto 4.
341913	346394	We finally got our internet open at work, so now we can start doing the death matches online, which is awesome.
346474	347715	Very looking forward to that.
348115	351496	I played a five minute deathmatch with one of my co-workers and it was fun.
352216	362399	It's pretty hard to spot people, especially even with all the pedestrians running around because, you know, you do see their name above their head and stuff, but sometimes it's hard to spot them amongst all the pedestrians.
363019	363699	So that was pretty cool.
363919	367860	And then today we just kind of played like a fuck-off game, you know, just a free play thing.
368621	369261	And that was fun.
369281	373082	I played that for about, I think, a good half hour, 45 minutes.
373722	377243	And just, you know, flying around helicopters and just, you know,
378203	378844	Thanks for watching!
396912	400133	I'm very, you know, looking forward to this game a lot.
400193	406614	I'm just worried, though, that... Because even, like, flying to the different islands and stuff, it's like, okay, now I've seen everything.
407515	408675	Eh, you know, I don't know.
408755	412496	But I think it's still very confusing stuff driving around.
412536	419418	You don't, you know... It's hard to orient yourself a little bit more than, say, the other games because there's a lot less in those other games.
420098	420338	But...
421604	422125	It's a good game.
422325	423105	Definitely a good game.
423966	424807	And see what else I play.
424867	425567	Oh, Crisis Core.
425587	426889	I played that a little bit on the plane.
429311	430932	I really can't get into that game very much.
431132	431853	It's too linear.
433654	433915	Really?
433975	438298	Because people have just been swooning all about Crisis Core, so I'm kind of surprised.
438399	439259	It's very linear.
439379	441361	I mean, you don't get a lot of places.
441421	443983	I mean, you can go explore a little bit, but it's very...
445484	446345	and DarkSakura.
468396	468876	I mean, I actually...
495353	500196	instead of playing the game on my flight back, I decided to read the SkyMall magazine.
500836	504458	I chose the SkyMall magazine over Crisis Core.
506699	508360	SkyMall has some pretty sweet stuff in it.
508400	510281	They do have some pretty interesting things in there.
510862	513203	They had some things I was like, hey, that's a pretty cool idea.
514344	514824	Good times.
514924	515364	Anything else?
516585	516725	Um...
518550	519570	I played something else.
519790	522111	Oh, I was playing this web flash game.
522171	525572	It's for Castle Crashers, but you're fighting a guy with a beard.
526732	526872	What?
526892	528133	Just a giant head with a beard.
529233	530993	Wait, it's a demo for Castle Crashers?
531013	537855	No, it's like a flash game that the guy that created Castle Crashers made with the characters from Castle Crashers, and you're fighting a guy with a beard.
538335	539036	Interesting.
540416	541576	I can't remember the name of it.
541676	544257	I'll find it, but it was interesting.
544927	545307	Alrighty.
546108	547088	I never say this name right.
547128	548209	I apologize to this poor guy.
548789	553672	WeToo says, Loki is reviewing a game, but nothing compares to his beloved Grand Theft Auto 4.
553732	554132	Is that true?
555613	556913	I mean, it's good.
557413	558434	I just enjoy it a lot more.
558694	559435	I don't know.
559735	561936	I'm not saying that it's better than any game out there.
561956	563977	It's just I'm enjoying it a lot more right now.
565017	566898	I mean, once Saints Row 2 comes out, who knows?
566978	571060	I mean... Ossifer completely disagrees with you.
571080	573702	It says, Crisis Core is the downright best game on the PSP.
575652	576413	I don't know about that
592392	592772	I don't know.
593173	598779	If they put Final Fantasy 7, like the actual 7 on there, I would probably say that would be pretty fun.
598799	601862	Final Fantasy 1 on the PSP was pretty fun.
602502	603503	So, I don't know.
603564	605646	Just maybe some more of the retro games, I guess.
608909	610891	I liked Space Invaders Extreme.
611372	612212	I really liked that game.
613255	614616	That game did seem like a lot of fun.
614856	616857	The few minutes I played the one you had.
617137	617657	I need to buy it.
617697	620819	That's something they need to bring to live in the PlayStation Network.
620939	623300	Seriously, that would do so well for them.
623540	624741	Space Invaders Extreme, by the way.
624941	632185	If you like those Mizuguchi games, like Rez and stuff, or Every Extend Extra, mix that with Space Invaders.
632465	633785	That's what Space Invaders Extreme is.
633825	634366	It's pretty hot.
634906	638269	because I am a huge... Like, Loki is to Grand Theft Auto.
638989	640570	I love Mizuguchi.
640851	642832	Like, everything he touches, I will defend.
642852	644774	Like, I even defended 99 Nights, okay?
645334	646195	Like, I'll admit it.
646215	647936	I don't even know what that is.
647956	648156	Wait, what?
648176	648617	You gotta say that?
648777	649918	I don't even know what that is.
650098	653240	99 Nights came out on the Xbox 360 and it was kind of the... Dynasty Warriors.
653260	656563	Once the game was just like, thank you, Dynasty Warriors, but it had its issues.
656943	659965	But I came on the show and I was like, it's not a bad game.
660666	661306	It's just not good.
661326	662668	It just needs a little work.
664824	666446	Chrono Trigger
683461	684082	Oh, okay.
684522	688865	Because I seem to remember a few weeks ago on this program, I took a lot of heat for not declaring it the best game ever made.
688885	690386	Okay, Chrono Trigger is great.
691087	697051	Didn't care too much about Chrono Cross, wasn't really impressed by that Chrono Trigger remake they were doing, the 3D one.
697191	697412	What?
697732	699813	Okay, I'm not a 3D child.
700074	704637	I am, like, strictly a 2D type of person, so that's why I didn't care for it.
704677	707499	But, yeah, I'm kind of a boring person when it comes to games.
707759	709560	You like your games very two-dimensional and vanilla.
709780	710460	Totally, yeah.
710480	713682	What about the 2D games with that 3D kind of look to them?
713762	715843	Like, I don't know, Beautiful Joe, kind of?
716443	717444	See, that's cool with me.
717944	720045	It's not, okay, it's case by case.
720085	722266	It's not strictly I won't play any 3D games.
722466	723526	I play 3D games.
723586	725187	It's just my preference.
726168	732911	I feel that they put more effort into the game when it's 2D because they're not focusing on trying to make it look all cool because it's 3D.
732931	734011	I don't know.
734412	735292	Super Nintendo forever.
736109	736890	Comments from chat.
737230	740633	Cyran says, and probably another name I'm mispronouncing, but you know what?
740653	740994	I do that.
741034	741634	I'm mispronouncing.
741714	742475	It's amateur radio.
743155	745137	It says, Chrono Trigger equals not that great.
746298	748120	Oh, you equals not that great.
748820	754245	Ossifer says, 99 Nights, I remember being reviewed on X-Play with a girl screaming horribly.
755046	757708	I remember watching X-Play and I was screaming horribly.
759449	760150	You're such a dork.
762215	762956	How was your gaming week?
762976	764317	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
764617	765778	I'm assuming Loki's done.
765818	766698	If he's not, I cut him off.
768159	768920	How was your gaming week?
768980	769300	I'm done.
770401	771121	Boring.
771201	774624	I played WoW and I started playing Puzzle Pirates again.
774924	776885	Nerd.
776986	781549	If for whatever reason, let's say a listener of this show has never heard of Puzzle Pirates before, is it a free MMO?
782555	791917	Okay, it went from beta to charge, and now they have kind of this system where you can play for free and then buy certain aspects of the game with real money.
792577	793978	Like if you want to have Johnny Depp hair?
794058	795138	Yeah, exactly.
795578	798899	Like clothes or an island or something like that, you can pay for it.
798999	802060	But essentially, it's just a big puzzle game.
802100	806141	If you've ever played something like Puzzle Quest or something, it's kind of sort of like that, but in a pirate setting.
806581	808841	You sail the ship by playing a puzzle.
808921	810482	You bilge the stations.
810562	811622	You do carpentry.
812122	813122	All that crap, you know.
813203	814903	But they're all, like, PopCap games, basically.
814923	816524	Because Bill Jean is, like, bejeweled, right?
816564	816944	Yeah, yeah.
817004	817685	It's pretty much like that.
817745	819125	One of them was, like, Dr. Mario.
819585	820846	Yeah, I think it was the sailing one.
821166	821426	Yeah.
821646	821926	Yeah.
822187	822727	But, yeah.
823287	824087	It's basically what it is.
824127	826689	But it's fun, and it's addictive, and, like... It is.
826889	829450	It's like PopCap, the MMO with pirates.
829790	852769	exactly that is exactly what it is that's a great description so but it's really fun and i like have been spending countless hours playing i know a few people that have really gotten sucked into puzzle pirates yeah a few people on my live journal on the friends list they just always talk about you know puzzle pirates it's good time it's like wow for the puzzle crowd i guess you could say all right yeah pretty cool that's pretty much it all right what do you do
853129	853929	My Gaming Week.
854049	858490	I must be... I feel like the one person on the planet who has not been all getting into Grand Theft Auto 4.
858831	859451	Here's my thing.
859471	862011	I like... Let me put this.
862111	863632	I respect Grand Theft Auto 4.
863812	865012	I think it is a good game.
865312	866793	But it's just not kind of like my thing.
867053	870314	Like, I have this big concern that I'm going to spend $60 in this game.
870394	874815	And I don't really play Grand Theft Auto for the story because I'm just not into those types of stories.
875415	875555	And...
876295	876776	Thanks for watching!
895169	899771	But you see, like, you say that about it, but, I mean, it's kind of like WoW.
900111	903973	You do the exact same thing over and over, day after day.
903993	906995	There's something more, WoW has a chat room, I can't explain it.
908055	910397	Yeah, I guess that's a good point, but I mean, actual gameplay aspects.
911477	914438	Wow is a giant chat room with spells.
914878	916219	Like, basically, you know?
916239	916939	That is kind of true.
917059	921081	But, I mean, like, there is going to be the, you know, there's the online element to it.
921161	921741	And I don't know.
921781	927263	You would just, I think if you pick it up and play it, you might get more into it than you actually think you would, Rod.
927603	928663	It's just me.
929064	929264	All right.
929524	932565	Well, J-Rod says, why doesn't Sky just borrow it from Loki?
932625	935386	Does he keep it in a fireproof safe guarded by pitbulls or something?
936710	938470	No, it's not a fireproof safe.
938530	943372	It's the safety deposit box that came with my special edition.
943552	946653	Plus, I would think that Loki just wants to hang on to it for a little while.
946673	948953	He'll probably let me borrow it in like six weeks.
949173	954775	Well, I can't really let you borrow it because I have to use it at work when we play our weekly deathmatches.
955415	958596	So, I mean, I have four copies of the game right now.
960276	960876	You gotta love that.
960916	963317	Loki has four copies of the game and he won't let me borrow one.
965497	969640	We have five people that want to play it at work, and in fact, I need to get another copy of it.
969720	970600	It's fine.
970760	971261	It's fine.
971301	973622	Like I said, I will buy it eventually.
973742	976104	I just don't know when that's going to be.
976823	978884	He's only got four copies, Rob.
979244	980405	I will find you one.
980505	980985	Shit.
981106	981466	God.
981486	982086	It's all good.
982126	982767	Don't worry about it.
982987	983487	I don't know why.
983507	983967	You know me.
984187	984708	You know me.
984728	987509	I gotta play one of the best games of, you know, the Xbox 360.
987549	988630	You're gonna find it for me.
988750	995374	I'm gonna play it for three hours and then Irene's gonna call and be all like, Rob, Karazhan tonight.
995454	997115	I'll be like, bye, Grand Theft Auto.
997275	1000397	I'll loan it to you and then you'll be like, I haven't had a chance to play it.
1000497	1002278	I've been playing World of Warcraft.
1003606	1004770	That's pretty much what it would be like.
1004810	1007759	Like three weeks later, hey, so how do you like Grand Theft Auto 4?
1008260	1009765	Oh, I still haven't played it yet.
1011457	1012297	I'm running heroic, Meg.
1012337	1012557	I'm sorry.
1012597	1014778	I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XI for a little bit.
1014818	1016038	You don't understand.
1016138	1018139	Slave Pens was the daily heroic.
1018259	1019199	I had to do it.
1019999	1023780	And then Survivor came back on TV, so I had to watch that.
1023860	1025621	Don't even joke about Survivor right now.
1025641	1026721	You know I'm tangent.
1027041	1028581	I'm hosting an online Survivor game.
1028601	1032082	Because I'll tell you what, one thing I love besides video game is cheesy reality shows.
1032102	1034403	And I'm actually hosting a Survivor game online right now.
1035103	1037124	And the cast that's playing is very fierce.
1037444	1038544	It's LiveJournal's Survivor.
1039284	1050079	and I played it like last year and it was a lot of fun and the cast is in it right now funny I'm having so much fun watching them just kind of like because I get to see everything they write behind this it's funny I'm having a great time
1050543	1052765	Are they like cutthroat and like bitchy?
1054165	1059269	I don't know how much I can say because some of them might be listening, but I'll just say everybody is definitely there to win.
1059949	1060390	So it's fun.
1060790	1061450	It's fun to watch.
1061751	1062411	I hope so.
1062491	1063492	It's much better than that.
1063532	1065994	You know, there was like a Survivor PC game that came out.
1066374	1067615	I think there were two of them that came out.
1067875	1068495	Total shit.
1069056	1070637	Total shit.
1070797	1077321	One of them you could actually play online and you could actually be Richard Hatch and not pay your taxes and stuff.
1077461	1077802	Wow.
1078641	1082143	So, look, I make no apologies for things that I might like.
1082203	1082944	I'm really sorry.
1083865	1089308	I couldn't play Grand Theft Auto because I was too busy hosting yet another Survivor online.
1089368	1090449	No, next will be Big Brother.
1090989	1092430	All right, anyhow.
1093271	1095272	Survivor, Big Brother game.
1095732	1097273	Look, you know... Big Brother on an island.
1097334	1104138	Look, you know, like, if... Okay, because you know Penny Arcade Expo is coming up, and there's going to be tons of people from all games there.
1104218	1107280	You know if, like, all-game Survivor happened at PAX, it would be good stuff.
1107300	1108121	It would be funny.
1109542	1111329	All the challenges could be about video games.
1112192	1112734	Okay, maybe not.
1113155	1113416	Alright.
1114625	1116486	Look, we have some housekeeping to talk about tonight.
1117227	1119948	First off, as you've already figured out, DarkSakura's not here tonight.
1120048	1123090	I'm not sure if she's going to be in to do the classic game tonight.
1123110	1126012	We have a backup plan just in case, but DarkSakura's not here tonight.
1126132	1136559	Also, I have to apologize in advance specifically to FootyMonster and Toshin, because last week I promised epic match game tonight, and we're not going to be able to do it tonight because we don't have enough people.
1136999	1138840	And I wasn't able to get together the...
1140737	1143139	I had Warcraft and Survivor stuff to do.
1143740	1143960	See?
1144240	1146603	I wasn't able to round up some of the other stuff I wanted to do for tonight.
1146623	1149806	This is why he does not get Grand Theft Auto 4 loaned to him.
1151287	1153189	I didn't even talk about my gaming week, but I will in a minute.
1153209	1154070	I'll do housekeeping first.
1154110	1154911	I'll talk about my gaming week.
1155892	1157333	So there won't be match game tonight.
1157353	1158714	We're going to table it to next week.
1158775	1160016	I promise we will have it next week.
1161297	1163560	Grand Theft Auto 4 Grand Theft Auto 4
1176690	1196595	and we'd put the winners or I'm sorry the winners will be put into voting and your guys' favorite will be the finalist and the finalist will go over to allgames.com to compete against all the other finalists from the other like what 10 shows, 14 shows, I lost count however many shows are competing and
1197515	1198235	Yeah, it's going to be fun.
1198375	1198915	It's okay, Rob.
1198935	1204257	See, when I win this contest and win another copy of the game, I'll happen to loan you that one, too.
1204277	1204597	How nice.
1204957	1205177	All right.
1205377	1220142	What I did want to play for you guys is I promised last week, I said we got a really great entry from somebody who unfortunately is ineligible because for reasons beyond our control, namely the fact that the limited edition console that is the grand prize only works in the United States or North American regions, I should say.
1220202	1223583	Canada, Mexico are fine, but it will not work in Europe either.
1223763	1225703	Loki's World of Randomness Do you have no free time?
1225723	1226724	Are you tired of raising your children?
1226984	1228264	Are your children little pussies getting beat up?
1251371	1254893	Just drop them in front of the TV with Loki's World of Randomness.
1255774	1259976	Run around a virtual world in a bingle outfit, while preforming random acts.
1260617	1278748	It will teach your children important skills, such as, how to attach a laser to their pet cat, how to disembody heads, how to take pictures of guys kissing, or how to shout fuck, or a combination of all of the above.
1279480	1291651	If your children suffer mental damage from playing this game or start killing their friends with their laser cats, it may result in a bonus lawsuit settlement from our legal department.
1299622	1300082	Perfect!
1300162	1302364	That is a perfect example of an entry.
1302424	1303144	It was beautiful.
1303484	1307366	It might have damn well won if Martin was eligible, but he's not.
1307707	1311629	So what's going to happen is that we're going to pick our favorites, like three, four finalists.
1311649	1311889	I don't know.
1311909	1312990	It depends on how many entries we get.
1313430	1314691	You can still submit them, by the way.
1314731	1316311	You have like five and a half hours.
1316652	1321754	So if you haven't submitted anything yet, you have time because you have until midnight Pacific tonight to get your entries in.
1321855	1322975	So you can send those in.
1322995	1324916	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you're listening right now.
1324936	1326677	If you're listening on the podcast, you're screwed.
1327118	1327258	So
1328118	1329740	If you want to submit it in, you have like five and a half hours.
1329760	1334164	And I'll tell you what, you don't have a lot of competition because only like a handful of people did it.
1334525	1338389	So I guess not that many people want the limited edition 1 and 8 Grand Theft Auto God.
1338469	1338849	I don't know.
1339129	1339590	I'll tell you.
1340148	1341109	because they know that I'm going to win.
1341990	1343471	You're an eligible asshole.
1344191	1344492	All right.
1345092	1347354	So anyway, but I will say there are some other good ones too.
1347614	1351878	We will play our favorites in a special podcast that will roll out sometime this week.
1352138	1355141	You guys can vote for them on our site, www.orangelandre.com.
1355161	1361506	The special podcast will be like just eight minutes long with the finalists and you can vote so you know who you're voting for on orangelandre.com.
1361926	1362326	Good times.
1362767	1362907	Awesome.
1363287	1365730	So that winner will be announced next week's show.
1366891	1371236	And also, did anyone else notice this is a slow news week this week, thanks to Grand Theft Auto 4?
1372798	1373018	What?
1373659	1375381	I see you're smiling evilly over there.
1375962	1378685	Is it just me that noticed it was a slow news week?
1380006	1380406	I don't know.
1381426	1382107	I didn't notice.
1382627	1384567	Because I was too busy playing Grand Theft Auto.
1385147	1389388	My gaming week, since I skipped it earlier, really not a whole lot of new stuff.
1390228	1392049	Actually, I haven't been playing WoW a lot lately.
1392089	1393749	I kind of took a break from WoW.
1394209	1398330	One game I have been playing quite a lot of and I've kind of surprised myself is Mario Kart Wii.
1398690	1400971	I've actually been having a lot of fun with Mario Kart Wii.
1401071	1402511	I don't play with the wheel either.
1402551	1405892	I think the wheel is kind of stupid and it doesn't control well for me.
1405932	1409293	So I use the Nunchuck and Wiimote, which works great.
1409793	1411054	I really like controlling it that way.
1427245	1428146	Thanks for watching!
1447768	1448889	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
1466596	1471118	You know, obviously the lack of voice chat and the lack of a decent friend code system.
1471158	1477481	I mean, nothing new that no one hasn't said about Nintendo before, but it's getting a little better.
1478101	1478542	A little.
1478662	1479342	Baby steps.
1479782	1481183	Nintendo's making baby steps.
1483644	1484745	But I have fun with Mario Kart Wii.
1485145	1486566	And some of the courses are amazing.
1486826	1492389	I love the Koopa Cape, which is that level that's kind of like the island one with all the rivers.
1492689	1497552	And then you actually go down into a pipe for part of it, and you're driving through the pipe, and then you come out.
1497852	1498413	It's awesome.
1498973	1502035	So I really like some of the course design in Mario Kart Wii.
1502055	1503076	I kind of wish there was more of them.
1504176	1507538	J-Rod in chat asks, Hey Sky, whatever happened to Lost Odyssey?
1507578	1509479	You ever finish that four-disc behemoth?
1510980	1511180	No.
1511600	1513341	You know, I got towards the end of the first disc.
1513521	1515702	No, I'm on the second disc of Lost Odyssey, actually.
1515762	1520824	And then Irene called and was like, Rob, Karazhan.
1521285	1522905	That was the end of Lost Odyssey.
1522965	1526207	No, that's a game I really, really do need to go back and beat because it was amazing.
1526627	1527308	Amazing story.
1528728	1529028	All right.
1529389	1531410	Now we can get into tonight's news.
1532608	1533609	Hooray, I'll start tonight.
1533669	1541016	Speaking of the Nintendo Wii, there is a special version of the Wii that is soon going to roll out to hotels.
1541076	1542978	It's actually going to be at the Westin Hotels.
1543038	1545620	Westin is a pretty upscale chain of hotels.
1545700	1548423	I was fortunate enough to stay in one in San Francisco once.
1548443	1550165	They're really nice, kind of swanky hotels.
1550505	1553948	They're actually going to be putting Wiis in their workout rooms.
1554349	1555450	It's like a Wii workout.
1556270	1559772	or Weston Workout is the program and then the Wii is going to be in this.
1560092	1560813	Here's the interesting thing.
1561433	1564735	The Wii's that they're going to be getting, the games are in there automatically.
1564835	1566076	No discs are required.
1566116	1569577	So I'm assuming it's on the limited space that's in there.
1570118	1575000	And the hotel, they're going to slowly add things like Wii Fit and Wii Sports.
1576181	1583065	Apparently this whole thing is kind of, quote, ideal for business travelers and families who want to stay energized while on the road.
1583605	1589006	That's a quote from the press release that was put out by Nintendo and Weston earlier this week.
1589766	1590707	So what do you think?
1591427	1592447	Kind of interesting.
1592847	1595308	You don't see video games in workout rooms very often.
1595628	1603469	But it just kind of goes to show that whole, like, you know, the whole Wii is an exercise machine craze that's going on.
1603949	1606270	How many calories do you really lose playing Wii Sports?
1607401	1608142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1625965	1627026	and I don't know, boxing?
1627326	1629829	Have you played boxing like a few times in a row?
1629849	1631470	Yeah, okay, the boxing's pretty good.
1631510	1632371	I gotta give that to you.
1632411	1633412	Yeah, that definitely does.
1633432	1637276	Until you figure out actually how to play the boxing game and realize that all you have to do is flick your wrist.
1638677	1639578	Shut up, Loki!
1641008	1643069	No, I think that's a pretty cool idea.
1643189	1649772	I mean, I'd probably rather play that than hop on the treadmill or lift a bunch of weights, you know, or something.
1649912	1654634	Frisbee asks, but what person is going to play Twilight Princess in a hotel workout room?
1654654	1658275	Well, I don't think that'll be one of the games that's on it because they said you can't put discs in here.
1658335	1663177	So I'm assuming it's going to be games like, you know, Wii Sports and Wii Fit and the more active type games.
1663477	1666419	Yeah, I don't, if it's going to be in the workout room, why would they put Twilight?
1666719	1669800	Frisbee in our chat also says, just put a DDR machine in there.
1671478	1672840	That's not a bad idea.
1673460	1675522	DDR's been around for, what, 10 years now?
1675582	1677424	You haven't heard about that going into workout rooms?
1677484	1683711	Although DDR's kind of gotten into the mainstream in other places, such as school physical fitness programs we've heard a lot about.
1683971	1684471	Yeah.
1684491	1685312	It's kind of interesting.
1685352	1686994	Yeah, that's really not a bad idea.
1687014	1688595	How about DDR on the Wii?
1688675	1690798	That's like workout times two, right?
1690818	1692719	Yeah, totally, I think.
1693160	1694601	It's also uber lame.
1696063	1697504	You were not a fan of DDR on the Wii.
1697944	1698724	It's stupid.
1698844	1705789	It's like, oh, hey, you remember how awesome hands and feet mode was in the PlayStation 2 DDRs?
1706450	1708051	Yeah, let's bring that to the Wii.
1708391	1709572	Except we'll do it with the Wii Remote.
1710333	1710773	Oh, guess what?
1710793	1711373	It still sucks.
1711774	1712234	That's right.
1712374	1713855	I didn't think it was that bad.
1714035	1714916	Oh, it's crap.
1715476	1719639	Because it's randomly thrown in there just for the fuck of it, and you look like an idiot doing that.
1719719	1720940	You don't have to play with that, do you?
1721100	1721921	I understand that.
1722061	1723922	So you don't have to play with hands and feet mode.
1723982	1726804	But the thing is, a couple things that I was disappointed about.
1727285	1733209	One, you couldn't add up your own edit steps using the hands and feet mode or the Wii remote and stuff like that.
1734697	1739644	Um, and two, just their placement in the songs as they were is just kind of random.
1740405	1742188	So, I don't know.
1742288	1744591	It just didn't really flow with the song at all.
1744991	1745112	So.
1745956	1746296	All right.
1746456	1748538	It was just like, hey, look, you're burning more calories.
1748678	1749038	Awesome.
1749098	1749379	Yeah.
1749439	1751800	I do want to say one other thing about this story before we move on.
1751840	1755823	The Westin workout is only going to be at 10 hotels across the United States.
1755843	1757905	I mean, obviously, there's workout rooms in all their hotels, I'm sure.
1757945	1760346	But this Wii thing is only in 10 hotels for now.
1761107	1763529	And it's in the big cities, New York, San Francisco, whatever.
1764289	1767852	I'm assuming this will roll out slowly to more and more hotels if it's successful.
1768372	1768873	But we'll see.
1769033	1771975	Because totally, I'm not going to stay at a hotel unless it has the Wii there.
1771995	1772075	Yeah.
1773157	1773738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1790755	1791797	We can't do that at home.
1808519	1810640	You're going to be out at Disneyland all fucking day.
1810820	1814042	You and Nelly are going to be tired as hell when you get back to the hotel.
1814102	1817964	And you're going to want to go just die in the couch and watch TV or whatever.
1818264	1820285	But the kids, they have energy.
1820385	1821345	Nothing but energy.
1821405	1824987	So what better than for them to go to the workout room and burn some more of that energy?
1825928	1828729	Yeah, because kids totally want to go to the workout room.
1828789	1831911	I can remember when I went to Disneyland, I was like, hell, let's go to the workout room.
1831931	1832891	This would be so awesome.
1832931	1835552	Instead of like, hey, let's go down the arcade downstairs.
1835632	1837173	Or I don't know, hey, let's go out to the pool.
1837473	1838474	Go swim around some.
1838774	1839774	Or hey, let's go run around.
1839834	1842835	Or hey, how about we play some video games on the TV there?
1844336	1846057	I hope your kids are twice as angry as you.
1846837	1852400	Actdeft says, Loki, this is probably made for busy businessmen and women that go to places but not actually visit the place.
1874540	1875341	Excellent point.
1875821	1876081	Oh, okay.
1876101	1877162	That's what it says in the press release.
1877342	1879063	Oh, well, that makes all the difference.
1879783	1884126	Why don't they just get some work done instead and stop fucking playing around?
1884146	1885147	Okay, I do this.
1885267	1886368	I'm a business traveler.
1886428	1888289	I go teach in other places sometimes.
1888369	1889209	I haven't done it for a while.
1889289	1890110	Sometimes I go to L.A.
1890150	1894833	or I go to wherever and I don't get put up at the Westin, but if I was the president of the company, I might.
1896294	1897575	I might actually get a kick out of this.
1898305	1899026	Alright, fine.
1899386	1900267	Go get a kick out of this.
1900407	1906532	I hope it's worth all the thousands of dollars that they probably had to pay for it to be exclusive there, or Nintendo probably paid them off.
1906552	1906952	I'm done.
1907093	1907513	I'm done.
1907593	1908314	I want to move on.
1908414	1909174	New subject.
1909915	1917061	Well, another disappointing idea was the idea to remove Clover's credits from the Okami Wii version.
1917802	1922846	I'm not surprised that Clover's been kind of getting the shaft ever since they were disbanded.
1922926	1924528	He said shaft.
1927059	1928099	Yes, I said Shaft.
1929600	1930180	That's right.
1930661	1931041	Shaft.
1932361	1945788	So, you know, it's not a big surprise that with the Wii version of the game coming out, hell, let's just get it even sloppier and other than putting watermarks on our covers, let's just remove their... They didn't really work on the game.
1945828	1948589	It's all Capcom, according to the new game.
1948829	1949390	Clover's Gone
1970031	1970331	Wow.
1970831	1971572	That was their excuse.
1971592	1972592	I swear to God, I'm not making it up.
1972632	1973213	That was their excuse.
1973233	1973493	Wow.
1974093	1975074	That's pretty retarded.
1975694	1978916	Hell, I could get the movie file from just a fucking video of it.
1979336	1981137	It's called print screen, folks.
1981477	1981937	Print screen.
1981957	1986240	You put the movie file up and you take a screen capture and then you can crop it down.
1986620	1990522	Of course, I guess you wouldn't know how to do that since you can't even fucking find a picture without a watermark.
1993069	1993869	It's just fucking lazy.
1993909	1995970	What has Capcom gotten really lazy lately?
1996010	1996791	I mean, seriously.
1997431	2002594	With all the fucking Mega Man games and shit that they've got coming out and Street Fighter remakes and fucking remakes of other games.
2002954	2005315	Do they have an original idea left with them?
2005395	2006095	I mean, seriously.
2007176	2007536	Whatever.
2007636	2008256	It's Okami.
2008397	2009397	It's been out before.
2009817	2012619	Buy it now because you're a whore and you'll buy these stupid remakes.
2013099	2015880	There is nothing different with the game other than it's ad waggle.
2016300	2019262	So I hope you enjoy your fucking PS2 port.
2022256	2024819	That rant had nothing to do with the credits getting cut.
2025499	2028103	Well, it sucks for Clover because God Hand was awesome.
2029384	2030305	Okami haven't played it.
2031426	2032908	Comments from chat.
2032988	2035071	Any quick thoughts, Rice Princess, before we go to chat?
2035111	2035711	Not at all.
2037333	2040317	Ossifer in chat says, Clover got shanked on that deal.
2040377	2044462	They made the game, they went out of business, but WTF, they should still get the credit.
2044862	2046804	Actdeft says, Capcom, we're lazy.
2047205	2050048	Cyran says, Capcom, quickly, make Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2050949	2055174	Chat.orangeonsradio.com Okay, just so you know, they have...
2056756	2064679	On Joystick, an actual video that was part of the end credit sequence with Clover's logo in there.
2065119	2071581	And for one, I don't see why they couldn't just, I don't know, keep that video sequence since it's pretty badass looking anyways.
2074662	2077063	But still, though, they can't do a screen capture of this thing?
2078944	2079804	That boggles my mind.
2080144	2080404	Sorry.
2082525	2085986	Ranma says in chat, Loki, some of us missed it the first time around.
2088297	2089038	Okay, great.
2090159	2092081	No, I'm sorry that you missed it the first time around.
2092561	2095043	Maybe you should, I don't know, keep up with games that are coming up.
2096785	2097646	You're so rude.
2097706	2101750	What if somebody doesn't have a PlayStation 2 and they couldn't play it the first time around?
2102330	2104192	Well, then, boo-hoo.
2105053	2105954	Go to a friend's house.
2107603	2109144	Alright, I don't know what to see.
2109384	2110824	Okay, I'm going to tell you what.
2111404	2114325	I'm going to make a capture of the logo.
2114425	2115706	I'm going to do the impossible.
2116366	2120547	Just look at me, I'm fucking David Copperfield, pulling out impossible feats.
2122808	2123409	Alright, have fun.
2124129	2125611	Let's go to... Oh, look at this!
2125811	2126612	Whoa, look at that!
2126712	2127993	I made a screen capture!
2128093	2129274	Oh, I'm fucking awesome!
2130035	2131356	Oh, that must have been really hard!
2131936	2135099	Dude, seriously, do they have people working there that are complete idiots?
2135420	2138743	I guess so, I mean, with shit sliding through the watermark.
2140164	2141085	Alright, moving on.
2142369	2150413	Talking about other Wii news, some pretty exciting developments in the virtual console world, especially if you are in the PAL regions, meaning Europe and the like.
2150874	2154315	If you're in the PAL regions, the return of the Hanabi Festival is coming.
2154896	2158958	Hanabi Festival happened a few months ago, and it was like Japanese games all month.
2159518	2161219	We got something similar over here.
2161279	2164301	They didn't make a festival out of it, but we started getting some Japanese games.
2164561	2167903	Well, guess what they're getting overseas on the virtual console?
2168204	2180271	They're going to get Final Soldier, Columns 3, Gradius 2, Star Parodier, Puyo Puyo 2, Cho Aniki is also scheduled to come out.
2180291	2185374	And if you don't know what Cho Aniki is, you're just going to have to look it up on Wikipedia or something to understand its awesomeness.
2186235	2187155	Awesomely badness.
2187175	2188276	Okay.
2190165	2190786	That's pretty cool.
2190806	2191927	I want more Japanese games.
2192027	2196792	I like the last set of games that came out, like the real Super Mario Bros.
2197013	2197613	2 and stuff like that.
2198114	2199736	How are they going to sell Choaniki?
2199776	2200657	That's what I want to know.
2201478	2202239	Just throw it on there.
2202579	2203840	Be like, look, it's an import game.
2203940	2204421	Buy it.
2205863	2206163	I don't know.
2206633	2207514	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2232335	2236657	And of course there are some other games other than Earthbound that have been rated as well.
2239218	2248261	Some of these including Super Dodgeball, which is not a big surprise since I believe Dodgeball Brawlers is coming out here on the DS pretty soon.
2249042	2254384	Samurai Shodown 2, Metal Slug, and Donkey Kong Country 3.
2256144	2256424	Rob?
2257005	2257345	What's that?
2257505	2260466	You need to get Earthbound and you actually should finish it.
2260928	2261329	I should.
2261929	2263671	I do love Earthbound.
2263771	2265693	I don't know why I just... Because I always rented the game.
2265713	2266654	I never actually owned the game.
2266694	2270298	I always rented it, and I never just... I always ran out of time to finish it, but I love it.
2270338	2275223	Well, you're totally like an adult, and you've been one for a long time, so you should go back.
2276104	2278366	You're totally like a bitch and you've been one for a long time.
2278506	2280607	I'm totally going to kick you.
2280627	2283849	So you should actually finish games, Rob.
2283949	2287352	I know it's... Look, I've told the listeners about this before.
2287612	2289413	I have gaming ADD.
2290214	2293856	I start a game and then another game comes out and I go, Ooh, shiny!
2293916	2296838	And I throw the other game in a deep dark closet and I start playing the new game.
2297059	2298680	And then something else comes out and it's a cycle.
2298860	2300061	I have total gamer ADD.
2300241	2301842	And by new game he means World of Warcraft.
2301862	2301942	Yeah.
2303496	2304016	Thanks for watching!
2315852	2317995	I go into console mode or whatever.
2318755	2319777	I know, that's kind of sad.
2319797	2322960	I've kind of drifted from consoles in the past few years.
2323040	2328707	I used to be totally pro-console and sort of anti-PC, but now it's kind of switched.
2328947	2331370	I'm not anti-console, but I just don't play console games anymore.
2331390	2335255	But the only PC game you're playing is World of Warcraft and Puzzle Pirates, my bad.
2336388	2338489	Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
2338989	2341170	This is why World of Warcraft doesn't come out for consoles.
2341530	2342991	It's keeping PC gaming alive.
2343091	2344131	It is PC gaming.
2344571	2345031	I shouldn't say that.
2345051	2347232	I'm going to get angry emails from PC gamers.
2347272	2351474	Well, there obviously is much more, but obviously World of Warcraft is the behemoth.
2351514	2352674	You can't deny that.
2352874	2357856	But there are games coming down the turnpike like Spore that are going to be the same thing.
2359457	2362660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2381335	2388379	Um, basically with, you know, it's kind of like the Xbox 360 and how they emulate the Xbox games.
2388959	2391981	Um, each virtual console game has an emulator built in with it.
2392081	2397664	So what they're basically doing is keeping the emulator in there and then stripping out the ROM and throwing another ROM in there.
2398284	2400706	So, um, it would run off that emulator.
2400906	2407630	And so it works on, they've done it with Pilotwings, 64, Smash Brothers, and, um...
2408650	2409331	Some other stuff.
2409371	2418898	But I was thinking, hey, the potential for this, you can Guardian Legends, you could do Super Mario RPG, pretty much anything that's on a virtual console.
2418918	2419458	And they've done it.
2419578	2425883	I think they've extracted ROMs or put ROMs from other games that are on other regions into the US ones.
2426464	2428946	I think basically just... I don't know.
2429406	2436712	What'll happen is you'll see the logo and stuff for whatever game it originally was because they haven't figured out how to change that yet.
2437012	2437132	But...
2437930	2440092	with the rate that they're going right now, that won't be long.
2442093	2450500	But it's just, it's very interesting how much they've, you know, before this was all secure, and now it's just, poof, like, night and day, just cracked completely open.
2451361	2458226	But, you know, I'm looking forward to, like, Guardian Legend or something, Blaster Master or something like that on, uh... Do put Blaster Master on my Wii.
2458467	2458807	Hell yeah.
2458827	2459367	That'd be awesome.
2459648	2460028	Oh, man.
2460308	2466732	but are you worried that there's going to be a Nintendo patch that comes out that shuts this whole thing off and possibly bricks consoles that did it?
2467492	2489626	I don't think that they can do that where you brick consoles and the other thing too is it's going to be hard for them to detect this stuff because they can see they can detect what virtual console games you have bought they know that but like if you say for example pirate one of these games and throw it on there it doesn't detect that it's actually on the console it's just data that's on there
2490146	2492367	So, it would be hard for them to do that.
2492647	2498648	And also, who's to say that you couldn't buy a legitimate game, like buy Super Mario Bros.
2498668	2503270	2 or something like that, and then go back, delete that, and inject something into the Super Mario Bros.
2503470	2503710	2 file.
2503970	2505570	So it still looks like you have Super Mario Bros.
2505750	2507891	2, but it really is like Guardian Legend or something.
2507911	2510972	So, I mean, I don't know.
2511452	2512232	It's just interesting.
2512540	2515141	Toshin in chat says, injecting ROMs is lame.
2515242	2516862	Buy the damn virtual console titles, thanks.
2517463	2518523	Well, what if they're not out yet?
2518743	2520484	What if you keep waiting for them and you just don't want to wait?
2521005	2524827	And who's to say that you couldn't buy them later on when they actually come out, but now you're playing them?
2526768	2530090	It'll be interesting to see how long it takes Nintendo to cut this off.
2530430	2532311	Frisbee says, Mario RPG anyone?
2534349	2552545	Toshin says then buy them when they get out so I guess that would be okay moving on to non-virtual console related things and talking about other types of games for the Wii and yes we play Xbox 360 and PS3 too it just so happens there's a lot of Wii news this week Boogie is apparently going to be getting a sequel Boogie Superstar
2552945	2554706	has apparently been slated for October.
2554746	2559428	It's been spotted on some websites out there for shopping.
2559468	2560669	I guess like game... I don't know.
2560789	2564671	They don't say exactly where, but I'm assuming it's either like Gamefly or GameStop or one of those.
2566071	2568753	October 14th is apparently going to be the release date.
2569413	2575356	Boogie, the first one, wasn't really that critically heralded, but I guess it did okay out there in the marketplace.
2576036	2580418	I imagine the engine, since it's been built, it's probably not that hard to inject new songs into it.
2580438	2580718	DarkSakura,
2596621	2597341	Oh well, it won't be long.
2597601	2605563	Speaking of games like Boogie, completely random tangent, Karaoke Revolution, because I was thinking about games where they don't change a lot from game to game, but the song list.
2605904	2607224	Karaoke Revolution, right?
2607544	2608104	You remember that game?
2608284	2613446	Okay, I saw a movie this week, Baby Mama, which was like, you know, I think it was like the number one movie at the box office last week.
2613486	2614966	I'm sure it's not anymore, thanks to Iron Man.
2615286	2617407	But, you know, Baby Mama came out.
2617507	2620188	Karaoke Revolution is like a plot device in the movie.
2620208	2620388	Really?
2620888	2625309	There's actually like a whole scene where they're playing Karaoke Revolution together, and kind of like, I don't want to spoil it, but you know,
2625629	2625769	BOOGIE
2648843	2649924	I have not played Boogie.
2650024	2651105	I've seen videos online.
2651145	2652045	I've heard from friends about it.
2652626	2652966	That's it.
2654067	2657829	I actually played Boogie at a mutual friend's birthday party.
2658450	2660491	It was kind of... It was okay.
2660912	2662753	I mean, there was nothing special about it.
2663874	2666035	I mean, it was just like Karaoke Revolution.
2666075	2666355	I think...
2667797	2695500	there was like something where you can make a music video of it or you can like edit you know the words or something like that like to make it fancy but it's it kind of felt like something that was more palatable to kids or something I don't know I don't know why as a lot of Wii games are yeah but I don't know I just didn't I wasn't thinking like oh this game needs a sequel they should make one you know when I played it so I just think that's kind of weird but whatever I guess it was they got enough money from it so
2696047	2696407	Alright.
2697128	2698169	Well, sequel coming soon.
2698949	2707557	Well, something that's a little bit different that's being tested out right now in the Wii Homebrew community is USB mass storage support.
2708177	2717044	And they just released the source code for USB mass storage device demo, which right now only handles basic error handling and...
2718065	2734195	Just some basic features, but eventually what they're hoping to do with this is allow the USB support from the console to be able to use memory sticks, flash drives, MP3 players, and FAT formatted USB hard drives.
2735055	2753549	and I don't know very interesting that kind of like what we saw with the PSP where they're adding features to the system that aren't yet available to kind of solve some of the problems with the system and then probably will be added later on by Nintendo type thing.
2753849	2759254	Kind of like what Sony did with the radio players and stuff like that on their system.
2759514	2763597	They went ahead and kind of saw what the homebrew community was doing and followed it up with their own
2765049	2765649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2789332	2790413	What a good reason.
2790633	2796900	Well, also because the way they've got it formatted in blocks, I mean, I guess they could still do that, but it's...
2798550	2798870	I don't know.
2799511	2800752	It's just lazy.
2800792	2801312	You know what?
2801693	2808899	I actually just was kind of screwing around one night and I have a little mini SD card in my cell phone and I actually copied a Wii file.
2808959	2811140	I copied the Mario Brothers channel just for giggles.
2811180	2813362	I copied it to my card and it worked.
2813402	2815084	I didn't have to format my card for blocks.
2815164	2818026	It's mixed in there with pictures I've taken on my cell phone and everything else.
2818466	2820748	So it's like I have Mario Brothers in my pocket everywhere I go.
2821669	2824131	But I was just kind of messing around seeing if it would work and it did.
2824171	2826193	You didn't have to format the card specifically for blocks.
2826213	2826293	Yeah.
2826912	2827232	I don't know.
2827352	2829294	It's just really lazy is what it is.
2847679	2847939	I don't know.
2849641	2851842	Some other games that are coming out soon for the Wii.
2851862	2853704	They're going to have some pretty interesting connectivity.
2854044	2855965	Ghostbusters, you know, is coming out soon.
2858107	2864252	Here's the thing, is that Redfly, the development team behind the Wii version of the game, they're also doing the PlayStation 2 version, just so you know.
2864872	2869055	In the Wii version, you're actually going to be able to use the DS wirelessly.
2869816	2870716	No, you can't.
2870857	2872778	Well, this is what's being reported.
2872798	2874099	The DS is a PKE meter.
2874119	2874459	Really?
2874479	2874539	No.
2876781	2882225	Yeah, unfortunately, that was something that was rumored to be happening, and they came out and said, no, that's not going to happen.
2882305	2882866	Who said that?
2882906	2884827	They actually came out and said, no, this was a rumor?
2884967	2885367	They did.
2885988	2887249	Aw, that would have been so awesome, though.
2887269	2892833	Yeah, it would be an awesome idea, and that's why exactly it wouldn't work, because it would be something smart.
2893153	2898077	And unfortunately, they can't do something smart, because that would be wrong.
2898405	2904611	Well, I guess this is all you get then for cool news about the Ghostbusters game and it's kind of borderline cool, I guess.
2904651	2908075	Bill Murray's coming back as old as he is to do the Ghostbusters.
2909426	2909786	Lines.
2909887	2911128	He's actually going to be in the game.
2911208	2912469	He's recording lines for the game.
2912509	2913530	So Bill Murray will be in it.
2914190	2914851	I don't know.
2914951	2916513	I'm kind of giving take on Bill Murray.
2916553	2917173	He's okay.
2917774	2918254	He is.
2918454	2919475	I used to think he was annoying.
2919495	2920696	But I love Rushmore.
2920876	2922858	Like if you've seen that movie from years ago.
2922938	2924360	He was great in that movie.
2925381	2926882	But Lost in Translation put me to sleep.
2927062	2928664	So I'm indifferent on Bill Murray.
2929604	2930125	There you have it.
2930413	2933214	Yeah, it's, in fact, here's the story here.
2933934	2940055	According to, it's not actually the company that you said, the Red Factor or whatever it is.
2940235	2943035	It's a company called Terminal Reality is the one behind it.
2943416	2947456	He says, I'm sorry to report, unfortunately, this is not a feature of the Wii and DS version of the game.
2947896	2949077	It would have been really cool, though.
2950117	2952517	And that's from Terminal Reality boss Mark Randall.
2952537	2952977	I agree.
2953718	2954758	It would be really cool.
2955158	2955598	Fix it!
2956621	2957381	Delay the game!
2957561	2958921	Make it so.
2959682	2961122	Did you just say make it so?
2961342	2963382	No, I didn't.
2963642	2975584	There was also that story a long time ago that they were going to do head tracking with boom blocks, but from what I hear and what I kind of gathered, the reason they didn't do that is because Nintendo stopped it.
2976144	2979645	Because they don't want people... There was a story.
2979845	2984726	They don't want people moving a lot in their games because they're worried, I guess, that they're going to get injured or something.
2985326	2991993	But it's almost like they won't allow developers to do something innovative unless it's Nintendo's idea type thing.
2992093	2992554	You know what I mean?
2992734	2998099	It's like, we'll roll out the enhancements to your gameplay and then you just follow suit.
2998120	3000882	It's fucking lame.
3002024	3002604	Interesting.
3006600	3011365	This kind of goes back to a story that we talked about a couple weeks ago.
3011525	3019632	Actually, that whole pole dancing Wii game, it's really being worked on.
3019752	3020513	It seriously is.
3020813	3021934	Peek-a-boo pole dancing.
3021974	3025237	Now, if anything I thought was a joke, it was this.
3025778	3027820	So this is kind of shocking to me.
3028980	3038306	This is basically a rep for Peekaboo and the licensing agency at AT New Media, Simon K. This is what they have to say.
3038626	3042229	Peekaboo will be all about fun and fitness for a new generation.
3042289	3048072	Peekaboo wants to make fitness benefits for aerobic pole dancing accessible to millions of Wii users.
3048112	3049293	Aerobic pole dancing.
3049933	3050714	Oh my god.
3050734	3053215	Do they actually have pole dancing classes you can take?
3053295	3053875	No, I know.
3053955	3057597	My friend tried to do a pole dancing party for her friends.
3057677	3058137	Did you go?
3058517	3058737	No.
3059498	3060078	Why not?
3060098	3061019	There's a pole right there.
3061039	3061319	I'm good.
3061339	3061639	Thank you.
3061679	3062379	I would play this game.
3066161	3081852	The goal is to encourage men and women of all shapes and sizes to improve their pole dancing skills while having fun toning up and burning calories.
3082033	3087937	Ultimately, Peekaboo and AT New Media want to do for pole dancing what Guitar Hero did for rock and roll.
3089315	3090796	I was playing peekaboo pole dancing.
3104126	3104807	Oh, man.
3105367	3107008	That's what they should put at the Westin.
3107488	3107748	Okay.
3107828	3108429	Oh, my God.
3108489	3108709	Okay.
3109209	3110690	Here's my thing with this, okay?
3110750	3111691	This is never going to work.
3112211	3113692	I mean, how the hell are they going to implement this?
3113712	3114032	Really?
3114312	3115733	This is really happening.
3115913	3117614	There really, really is going to be a policy.
3117634	3118595	They're really going to do this.
3118715	3119115	Really.
3119436	3119676	Really.
3119696	3120516	This is not a joke.
3120836	3123058	I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't said, uh, no.
3124422	3126164	What ever happened to the seal of quality?
3126944	3130467	This right here, well, yeah, seriously, what did happen to the seal of quality?
3131308	3133569	No, this right here, though, is going to be so bad.
3133649	3147140	I mean, granted, it's not, obviously, it's not going to be a sexual game whatsoever, but the fact that you put, you know, oh, it's a game with a, it's teaching you to be a stripper, you know, that's the spin that they're going to put on this shit.
3149262	3150122	I don't know, it's just...
3151789	3158161	there was nothing said about stripping it's aerobic pole dancing there was nothing said about stripping
3158621	3161002	Yeah, I participate in aerobic pole dancing.
3161062	3163382	Or I should say my wife participates in aerobic pole dancing.
3163542	3163722	Wow.
3164023	3164303	Nice.
3165183	3165583	That's hot.
3166663	3173905	Okay, so is it just because they're trying to focus on aerobic games or games that get you moving?
3173985	3174886	It's just a bad idea.
3174966	3176166	It really is a bad idea.
3176226	3176526	It is.
3176626	3178587	It's stupid.
3178687	3180547	Honestly, how the hell are they going to do this?
3180587	3182848	First off, people are going to, you know...
3184139	3190242	From what I gather, this stuff is pretty hard to... I mean, it's not like something you can just go, we're just going to swing around on a pole and stuff.
3190502	3193324	You know, you got to be pretty, you know, in shape to do this kind of crap.
3193544	3195325	People are going to be falling on their fucking heads.
3195725	3199167	I mean, it's not like the Wii balance board where you just stand there and kind of lean to the side.
3199227	3201768	This is like fucking crazy shit.
3201868	3202849	I mean, I don't know.
3203149	3204650	Is it actually going to come with a pole?
3205110	3206291	I think it's going to come with a pole.
3206531	3207351	Because this company...
3208857	3211401	They make a stripper pole that you can buy.
3212042	3214826	They sell them at fucking Spencer's.
3215587	3215867	Nice.
3216148	3220254	So why do you think... I don't understand how this would work.
3220334	3221215	Because even... Okay.
3222978	3223198	Just...
3224692	3227556	Bad idea aside, how the hell are they going to implement this?
3227596	3228657	That's what I was going to ask.
3228697	3232741	When are you going to have buttons on this thing or something?
3232761	3235224	Is it going to sense your movement?
3235384	3237666	It doesn't seem like it would work.
3237686	3240690	They're throwing a concept out there and like, okay, will someone make this please?
3240710	3242952	Because we can't think of a way to do it.
3243052	3245315	I just don't see them... This is not going to be a...
3247038	3247598	I don't know.
3248039	3249219	People will buy it because it's weird.
3249599	3250760	I know that.
3251020	3254282	Which will come first, Final Fantasy XIII or peek-a-boo pole dancing?
3255042	3256023	Peek-a-boo pole dancing.
3258692	3267802	So, do you think they chose the Wii console because of the fact that it has a sensor bar and they might incorporate that?
3267822	3270485	Because it's fitness-driven.
3270825	3275391	And honestly, the Wii has gotten into a lot of family homes.
3275951	3277934	Women are playing the Wii.
3279673	3284215	You mean like housewives, moms, like... Strippers, yeah.
3284275	3286197	Strippers, yeah.
3286397	3289939	Well, I don't think strippers need to play the stripping game, though.
3290339	3292240	I mean, the, excuse me, aerobic pole dancing game.
3292260	3292660	Yeah, thank you.
3292680	3293961	They do that every night.
3294061	3297663	They don't need to go home and take their work home with them or anything.
3297763	3300444	So, I don't think they're part of the demographic.
3300504	3301665	But, you know, like, you know...
3303687	3308670	Wives who want to do something special for their husband and want to be sexy for their husband.
3308750	3309970	Oh, sweetie, sit down.
3310050	3311671	I'm going to do something special for you.
3311691	3312832	And they turn on the Wii.
3314052	3315393	It's like, you're kidding, right?
3315433	3318815	Dude, most guys would be happy that their wives are playing video games in the first place.
3318855	3320376	But a pole dancing video game?
3320796	3322777	I do see the positives in that.
3325970	3329635	All you have to add to that is her bringing you a beer and cooking your ribs for dinner and you're set.
3329795	3330356	Oh, that's it.
3330436	3331177	Yeah, that's it.
3331317	3331998	It's perfect.
3332118	3332399	Yeah.
3332659	3333060	I don't know.
3333120	3338307	It's just... It's like the April Fool's joke that won't die.
3339766	3340047	All right.
3340667	3342468	Well, these are not a joke.
3342588	3344289	It's the upcoming release dates.
3344490	3347031	Jamie's not here tonight, so I'm going to cover Europe for you guys.
3347212	3348693	There's really not a lot anyway.
3349313	3353036	On May the 9th, Boom Blox finally makes its way in Europe to the Nintendo Wii.
3353096	3357279	Also coming to the Wii, Dragon Quest Swords, the Masked Queen, and the Tower of Mirrors.
3357339	3360341	That's that whole game where you can actually use the Wii as the sword.
3360701	3363243	We played that here, the Japanese version, a long time ago.
3363283	3363603	Did it ever
3363663	3365085	Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto
3386440	3395427	Starting off with, well this is not just only on the Wii, but Speed Racer, that's going to be coming out on both the Wii and the DS this week.
3396788	3400992	SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1, coming out on the PSP this week.
3402093	3405255	Baseball Mogul 2009, coming out on the PC.
3407197	3411480	Let's see here, Chameleon on the PSP, it's kind of like a...
3412806	3419213	Brain Voyage, Nintendo Crosswords DS, Dog Island on the Wii,
3433303	3433963	Whoopie Doo.
3435184	3439726	It's probably the cutest Wii game out there.
3439746	3441286	Do you get a bazooka in Dog Island?
3441826	3442187	I don't know.
3442247	3443567	I kid, I kid.
3443747	3446848	But you run around as dogs with giant heads.
3447249	3448909	Boom Blocks, that's coming out on the Wii.
3450670	3454171	Also, R-Type Command, it's coming out on the PSP.
3454331	3457032	There's some pretty cool pre-order bonus with that too, I think.
3458073	3458153	Um...
3459517	3488865	Call of Duty 4 is getting the game of the year edition finally on Playstation 3 and let's see here I think that's pretty much it oh that's right I thought this was still coming out but I think it may have moved again was it Blastworks supposed to be coming out on the Wii I thought but I think it moved I don't know
3491038	3516862	Blastworks I'm really looking forward to I hope that doesn't suck I would do Japanese release dates about this time but there is seriously nothing coming out in Japan this week at least on the calendar I have the next wave of games is not till the 15th which will be next week you have Luminous Arc 2 on the DS to look forward to next week on the 15th but as far as this week goes you're just going to have to play the games you already have nothing new coming out in Japan
3517677	3522179	Bobby Blackwolf 5 o'clock on all games
3544861	3545823	Whatever, we're not going.
3546766	3551357	But anyways, Activision and Vividi have discontinued their ESA membership.
3555675	3560459	Also, kind of going along with that, they are not going to be at E3.
3560959	3578132	So, according to ESA's Rich Taylor, Senior Vice President of Communications and Research, he says, we can confirm that Activision and Vimvindi Games, I thought it was Activision Blizzard, but, you know, I could be wrong, opted to discontinue their membership.
3578192	3583516	The ESA remains dedicated to advancing our industry's objective as protecting intellectual property.
3584316	3591399	Preserving First Amendment rights and fostering a beneficial environment for the entire industry.
3591759	3597241	I guess they don't really have that many offensive games or anything, so they don't really need them to defend their rights for anything.
3598161	3609265	Or at the same time, I guess they don't really have to participate in their defending the rights of gamers and the gaming industry because if they're doing it for other people, it still kind of loops them in there.
3609305	3611686	It's kind of like going along for a free ride type thing.
3616062	3620506	While the Entertainment Software Association remains the permanent voice for the U.S.
3620766	3630574	computer and video game publishers, we can confirm that Activision and Vendee Games opted to discontinue their membership and blah blah blah.
3632135	3632475	Huh.
3633356	3634117	That's interesting.
3634977	3635678	So why'd they do it?
3635718	3636679	That's the question of the week.
3637900	3638380	It doesn't say.
3638400	3639381	I think they're just being cheap.
3640962	3641343	Think about it.
3641383	3657292	If you're a group of companies and you're paying the ESA to defend you from these laws out there that are trying to prevent M-rated games being sold to anybody or calling games porn and stuff like that.
3657852	3665656	If you say drop out of this organization, this organization is still working for other companies to defend them against other things.
3665736	3667878	Instead, now they have less money to work with.
3668920	3672682	Um, that's really the only downside, but they're still fighting for you.
3672762	3673903	It's just, you're not paying them.
3673923	3679925	You're kind of just sitting there, you know, it's like your friends all chip in for pizza and you're just like, oh, that's cool.
3679965	3681106	I'm not really hungry right now.
3681146	3683867	And later on, you know, oh, there's some pizza leftover.
3683887	3687229	So you start, you know, scoffing down a piece while you're just a freeloader.
3687389	3712402	yeah it still affects them regardless of whether they're a member of the ESA or not so they why would they just pay to do that you know and also do they really make any games that would be affected by any kind of law publicity um Activision probably not because I think they mainly just you know Call of Duty 4 is probably the riskiest thing that they have but that's not even really that bad um
3714267	3718751	Actdeft in chat makes the comment a lot of people I've kind of seen have been making this week.
3718771	3720273	Screw E3, PAX is where it's at.
3735662	3739663	Well, E3 is kind of beginning its decline, I guess.
3740003	3742784	Yeah, there's nothing special about E3 anymore.
3742844	3744444	Nobody cares about it.
3744484	3746945	Do you think these companies actually missed the old E3?
3749326	3750426	It's possible, yeah.
3751126	3758988	I don't know, because a lot of the comments I've seen, or theories on it, is they got tired of E3 being kind of a pissing contest of who's flashier, who's...
3762688	3762928	and so on.
3783923	3784844	No press events like that.
3784864	3785884	That was my thought, exactly.
3786045	3788066	The whole press comes out for Gamers Day.
3788866	3790327	All these Gamers Day stuff.
3790507	3791388	Why bother doing anything?
3791528	3792409	Well, you know what I mean.
3792489	3792929	Bastards.
3793289	3794270	The elite press.
3794750	3796912	We didn't get invited to E3 either, so whatever.
3797272	3802355	But they get into these things, so why bother with E3?
3802675	3809280	Exactly, and it doesn't really matter if the press gets to see this stuff anyways, because a lot of times they're just sending them pre-release copies of these games anyways.
3809820	3810821	It really...
3812259	3818120	Unfortunately, press isn't working the way it used to before where people are actually reporting on things.
3818221	3826503	Now they're working closely with these game companies, and the game companies are telling them how to report stuff, and they're going back and forth and making deals and that kind of thing.
3826623	3830884	It's really all the presses in their pocket type thing nowadays.
3832304	3833965	Because everybody wants to break exclusives.
3834065	3836526	Yes, everyone wants their exclusives.
3836786	3843449	And fortunately, as we found out the hard way, that goes to the people that can make the deals.
3843529	3850771	Say, hey, I'll tell you what, we'll give you premium advertising for your game on our website if we can break this exclusive on the story.
3851112	3857194	And they will just literally tell you one thing, oh yeah, everyone's going to get the story at the same time.
3857254	3861256	And just, poof, it gets out there and they're like, oh, well...
3862196	3865878	Sorry, I thought everyone's on the same page about this kind of stuff.
3866598	3871680	Really, it's just, you know, they follow the money.
3873541	3875322	Well, they are business people, so.
3875602	3878904	I would love to see an underground blog come out that just outs all these things.
3879384	3879924	You know what I mean?
3880384	3882425	Before the companies buy in.
3884046	3885927	If it's possible, it might be, I don't know.
3886287	3886487	Hmm.
3889056	3889376	I don't know.
3890517	3891577	Other comments from chats.
3892137	3893798	ShadowCharlie simply says, fuck E3.
3894438	3897459	Weedoo says, E3 was a sensation that grew too out of control.
3898820	3899080	I don't know.
3899120	3903962	I would think maybe some people kind of miss the glam that comes with E3 because, boy, that show got a lot of press coverage.
3904462	3905822	A lot, a lot of press coverage.
3906203	3908603	And now the toned down one, not quite as much.
3909304	3915166	You know, maybe amongst the hardcore gamers, sure, but amongst the general public, not so much.
3917607	3917867	I don't know.
3919429	3931312	And they're saying, I know they're excuses that we've heard before, we're just like, oh, it's hard for us to make demos and stuff for these events, and it really interferes with our production schedules and stuff like that.
3934273	3941875	I haven't really noticed an issue over the last 10 years or whatever that these have been, probably even longer than these have been going on, so...
3943706	3944707	I think that's just an excuse.
3944747	3952352	I think they're just looking at ways to save money because nowadays, I don't know if they're not making as much money or maybe the margins are smaller, but cutting costs any way they can.
3952792	3957615	And a glamorous event like E3, that's definitely an expense that they can probably do without.
3957947	3958507	Well, guess what?
3958587	3963048	Activision and Vivendi are not the only ones who have decided to skip E3 this year.
3963388	3965449	That's what makes this story even more interesting.
3966029	3972410	NCSoft, Foundation9, and Atlas have all also opted out of this year's E3.
3972470	3975471	This has been confirmed by other attendees as well.
3976511	3977152	Kind of interesting.
3979693	3987785	GameSpot has reported Foundation9 is out because we just didn't feel like we got enough out of the investment last year in order to justify the expense this year.
3988285	3992231	That is telling me, that sounds like a quote where somebody sounds like they missed the old E3.
3993052	3994113	Not getting enough exposure.
3994734	4000298	Whereas the old E3 was all about, yes, it was a little bit sensationalistic, but think about all of that exposure.
4000458	4009444	Yes, you had people at E3 that may or may not have been there, but they get the word out and they're loving all the stuff they see because it's E3.
4010124	4010965	Everybody's pumped!
4011025	4012545	Every game you play is awesome!
4012686	4026413	What they've changed from years past, they've gotten rid of the Kenshiya Hall, where you had all the independent game companies and stuff down there, where people, after they visit all the other booths and stuff, they just go down there and check out a lot of these games that don't normally get pressed.
4026853	4031895	You'll see a lot of stuff down there that's pretty amazing that'll eventually get picked up by a company and stuff.
4032816	4037638	They would get a lot of foot traffic, a lot more than they would get if they just had a booth at this new E3.
4037658	4037898	Because
4040200	4065676	from what I heard there was you know obviously before there was a lot of traveling in between hotels and stuff like that and a lot of more of a strict schedule so it was a lot less time to kind of explore it at your own pace and that probably also the decreased foot traffic kind of hurt them a little bit because when you have a lot of stories to cover and stuff a lot of the independent media doesn't get to cover these you know smaller companies and that kind of sucks all right well um
4067043	4074306	Also, some other speculation going on around the internet about exactly why this is all going down this week, which was probably the biggest thing that happened this week.
4075166	4080828	Kotaku managed to get the organizer of the Penny Arcade Expo to comment on this.
4080848	4086470	This is from Robert Koo, who's the director of business development for the Penny Arcade Expo.
4086490	4095634	Quote, the reason that E3 imploded in recent years was because the publishers felt that it turned into this sort of pissing contest between them, where they were trying to figure out who could one-up each other.
4095994	4098855	They all thought to themselves that it just wasn't worth it.
4101356	4104157	I would imagine that the show is still trying to look out for what the publishers want.
4104177	4109459	That's the whole goal of the trade association, which is to deliver the needs and try to figure out what their members actually want.
4112239	4113059	So there you have it.
4113179	4116380	More speculation as to why E3 may be shrinking.
4116420	4120821	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks.
4120921	4125262	I'm curious if this is going to be the start of a mass exodus or what's going to happen.
4125442	4128422	You may see that because remember E4ALL?
4128663	4134004	Same kind of thing happened there with big companies saying, nope, we're not going to be a part of this.
4134024	4135944	Microsoft and Sony both pulled out of that, didn't they?
4136024	4136924	I think so, yeah.
4137284	4139265	You think these companies might go to E4ALL instead?
4139945	4140025	No.
4141209	4141769	I don't think they will.
4141809	4142610	I think they'll do their own.
4142810	4148973	Because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo don't really need these kind of events anyways because they have their own big events.
4149513	4154336	In fact, one we'll be talking about in some last minute stories, the PlayStation Day.
4155356	4161179	They invite the press out for that kind of stuff and I know Microsoft has their own conference and same with Nintendo.
4161279	4165622	So there's really no reason that they need to be a part of E3.
4167725	4169647	I mean, especially if it's going to cost them a lot more money.
4169667	4174091	I'm sure they would like the press for it and stuff, but I don't know.
4174191	4179136	I still miss the... I would hate it if they didn't show up because I miss their press conferences.
4179176	4183160	That's my favorite part, hearing all their cool new things.
4183460	4189246	Although Nintendo last year was kind of disappointing with those Wii Zapper and Wii Wheel dumb ideas, but whatever.
4191247	4194650	Anywho, back on a different subject here.
4195131	4196092	Prince of Persia!
4196272	4201416	Well, we talked a little bit a few weeks ago that there was going to be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming out.
4203498	4205440	The brand new game is...
4206641	4213125	I guess it's going to be just called Prince of Persia, and not some sort of Prince of Persia prodigy or whatever.
4213746	4219610	But it's scheduled to be released on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
4220010	4225393	It will be a prequel to the previous Prince of Persia series, and I believe it's going to be a trilogy as well.
4227134	4242737	It's supposed to introduce, I guess, an illustrative art style, and I guess the DS is also getting their own Prince of Persia game, but it's going to be exclusive to that console, and it'll be its own unique storyline.
4243057	4243757	Pretty cool.
4245057	4251118	And they actually... I found... I think I found some scans.
4251138	4254859	There was a magazine... What was it?
4254919	4255379	It was...
4258434	4259094	Joypad.
4259235	4262876	It's a magazine that had some pictures.
4263476	4264697	It looks pretty cool, actually.
4264777	4270500	It's almost not really cel-shaded, but sort of.
4271260	4273181	I don't know how I would really describe that.
4273621	4276322	What do you think about this, Rob, here real quick?
4276382	4280064	I'll link the chat room to these scans as well.
4280704	4280824	It's...
4283105	4286968	You know, I'm not surprised that Prince of Persia is continuing, especially, you know, they have this movie coming out.
4287008	4291590	I'm a little bit surprised they're kind of relaunching it as a, you know, kind of spin-off series or what have you.
4291610	4294692	But, you know, if they're going to do that, that's probably why they're trying to change the look of it and everything.
4294752	4295773	So, why not?
4296213	4298174	Prince of Persia has always been a solid game.
4298194	4299255	I think that's the best way to describe it.
4299295	4301436	Prince of Persia series is a very solid line of games.
4301516	4302837	So, you know, what the heck?
4303778	4305519	But that's an interesting art style, I think.
4305739	4307780	Oh, yeah, it looks like Okami-ish.
4307920	4308861	I don't know if that's the right way to say it.
4308881	4311663	Yeah, I guess it would be like a cross between Okami and, say, like...
4313536	4316257	I don't know, just like a normal action game.
4316297	4318578	It's like, I don't know, it's really hard to describe.
4318678	4322780	It's a 3D game with, like, ink lines on the outside, I guess.
4323820	4325361	Anyways, I'll link it in the chat room.
4325461	4327782	It's on a website, actiontrip.com.
4329262	4329562	Alright.
4330423	4332924	Well, in other news, Clock Tower.
4332964	4333804	You remember this game?
4334244	4336865	Long time ago, it was out on the PlayStation.
4336905	4338466	Can you describe what happened in Clock Tower?
4339450	4340211	You were a girl.
4340311	4342133	I don't remember the specifics of it.
4342193	4346697	I guess she got locked into a house or something, a mansion.
4347217	4354984	And basically the objective was for you to hide from this crazy, huge scissor welding guy.
4356665	4359348	And you would be walking around the house.
4359788	4360688	I saw this game like one time.
4360708	4361749	This game was a trip from what I remember.
4362169	4362549	It was scary.
4362569	4362849	It is scary.
4386058	4387139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4402330	4402831	I can't wait.
4423489	4427752	The folks who produced The Hills Have Eyes 2 are producing this.
4427832	4428813	I don't know so much about that.
4429193	4432575	Marco Weber and Martin Wise.
4432655	4436197	It sounds like it'll be, at least if nothing else, a good horror film.
4436217	4440920	I just don't want it to be a cheap, cheesy film.
4441341	4444763	I want it to have some substance in it.
4445383	4450927	Even though it is a video game movie, I want them to actually do something with it.
4451474	4451774	All right.
4452494	4453135	We'll see what happens.
4455155	4463177	Well, because this week was so big with Grand Theft Auto 4, people were wondering, well, where is the PC version of the game?
4463277	4471600	And like you may remember with the other ones, it was a while after they came out that the PC version finally made its way to the market.
4473244	4485470	Um, of course, Rockstar is, you know, doing the old no comment thing on the Grand Theft Auto 4 PC version, but more than likely it will probably be around at some point.
4485790	4490212	People are hoping that maybe by this holiday we'll see it on the PC.
4490432	4491213	I don't see why they wouldn't.
4491253	4492633	I mean, that's more sales for them.
4493674	4497115	And, uh, especially, I imagine the PC version will probably look a little bit better, too.
4498176	4499677	Especially on some high-end PCs.
4500037	4500477	But, um,
4502250	4508554	There are some publishers, though, that are still listing the game as being released October 30th, 2008.
4508694	4520982	Of course, you know, Take-Two or Rockstar has not announced the release of that game or even the existence of the game, so I don't know.
4521422	4530408	If it's any consolation, though, the last three PC releases for Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas were all pretty quiet, too, so...
4532984	4533785	Maybe there's a possibility.
4534866	4536587	Although I don't know if 3 was on the PC.
4537087	4537687	I know Vice City.
4537707	4538027	Wasn't it?
4538148	4539028	Oh yeah, Vice City was.
4539128	4543331	Vice City and... Actually, I think 3 may have been on the PC.
4543351	4543831	I don't remember.
4544091	4546413	But I know Vice City and San Andreas were.
4547553	4552716	Alright, well, guess what I've got for you guys here before we get to the end of Part A. What's that?
4555058	4556919	Yes, it's another stupid award for the week.
4559473	4562294	Sadly, this week, it's not so gruesome.
4562314	4564975	I guess it's actually a good thing, because we don't actually like people dying.
4565396	4567676	But this is very stupid nonetheless.
4567796	4568877	It happened in San Diego.
4568897	4572478	A 27-year-old robbed a GameStop.
4573059	4578641	He actually pepper-sprayed two employees and stole launch-date copies of Grand Theft Auto IV.
4580445	4581987	Thank you for watching!
4599788	4606794	and they found a copy of Grand Theft Auto 3 and a PlayStation 3 controller in his pickup truck along with the stolen copy of Grand Theft Auto 4.
4607175	4610878	Here's what the police department commented to the local NBC affiliate in San Diego.
4611198	4623709	The call came out as a robbery of a commercial business and the suspect was described and the vehicle truck that he got into was described as a white Toyota pickup truck lifted with the tailgate down and our helicopter Abel spotted the vehicle southbound.
4624050	4625371	The officers followed it.
4629440	4630241	So, that was it.
4630601	4639549	No word on how many stars he accumulated in the heist.
4639669	4643973	Comment from chat, Alpha Canogram says, I bet Lord Voldemort paid that dude to do it.
4644233	4648437	Of course, Lord Voldemort is our other name for you-know-who.
4649277	4651419	Tack Johnson.
4651860	4652781	Probably paid him to do it.
4654802	4655143	Anyhow...
4656596	4658938	If you're going to steal a game, well, you just shouldn't steal a game.
4659018	4659998	Stealing games is stupid.
4660719	4662680	Especially, I mean, he stole one game.
4663201	4665962	I mean, if you're going to steal more.
4666183	4668464	It's just funny.
4668704	4669985	No, you shouldn't steal at all.
4670265	4671686	It's very bad when you steal.
4671906	4677951	Hey, we're going to get somebody on the line here to do something special for you here at the very, very end of part A of our podcast.
4678091	4681813	Because you know what happens at the end of part A of our show all the time.
4684795	4685536	Two ringy dingies.
4687150	4687871	Hi, Jamie.
4689071	4689331	Hi.
4689571	4692173	Hey, it's Rob, Orange Lounge.
4692293	4693613	The show misses you tonight.
4693673	4694194	How you doing?
4696355	4696795	I'm dead.
4697215	4697675	You're dead?
4698536	4699336	I'm sorry to hear that.
4699356	4700797	Did the guy from Clock Tower kill you?
4701977	4703378	No, no, no.
4703438	4707840	I moved a lot of furniture yesterday and then ran errands all day and then drove back.
4709610	4713491	Well, hey, you know, we're at the end of Part A, finally.
4713551	4716011	We surprisingly ran long tonight with not much gaming news.
4716991	4724013	And, you know, there's always a segment that we do at this part of the show, so we had to bring you here to give us your Classic Game of the Week!
4726193	4735575	It's your part of the show where we pay respect to our elders in gaming, with Jamie picking out a game from the long-lost archives of games that folks should really check out this week.
4735615	4737495	So, Jamie, what did you pick for the kids tonight?
4738874	4742722	I picked out nothing that was obscure or crazy or weird or anything.
4743303	4744345	I picked out Super Mario Bros. 3.
4750563	4753444	Yeah, um, it's actually one of my favorite games.
4753484	4755604	When it came out, I went, like, completely crazy.
4755644	4758345	It was the only reason that I would see The Wizard to begin with.
4759005	4759325	Mm-hmm.
4760425	4765827	So, um, the game, you know, it was, it took, because, you know, what Super Mario Bros.
4766007	4768387	2 was over here wasn't really Super Mario Bros.
4768407	4768387	2.
4768447	4769508	Super Mario Bros.
4769528	4778870	2 was more like a, the original was more like a rehash of the first game, whereas 3 actually did some real innovations, um, by having your different worlds and
4779827	4780808	different things like that.
4782629	4789454	So, uh, the whole point of it is, uh... Okay, I didn't mean to read through my thoughts.
4789735	4797921	The whole point was that it's still that formula that everyone had become accustomed to, and then just blew it up really big.
4798081	4799182	You know, it was really cool.
4799542	4801083	Um, you had eight different worlds.
4801263	4805847	You had, um, World 1, which is grassland, World 2 is desert, uh...
4806634	4816739	3 was Seaside, 4 was Big Island, 5 was The Sky, 6 was Iceland, 7 was Titanase, and 8 was Castle Koopa.
4817900	4833728	So, um, you know, each world had, you know, different maps that would go along with the theme of whatever that world was, but you also had different, um, little mini-fortresses that you had to go to, and then you had your primary boss, which was
4834221	4841185	I remember the bosses were all pretty easy if you just keep stomping on their heads repeatedly and don't let them get any moves on you.
4841205	4841706	Oh, that's true.
4841726	4842666	I guess that's true.
4842686	4842826	Yeah.
4867455	4872677	It's the best-selling that was not originally packaged with the system.
4890060	4893803	Oh yeah, because obviously you have Super Mario Bros.
4893843	4895504	as the pack, and of course that's going to sell more.
4895764	4896364	Technicality.
4897485	4900467	I remember this game for being featured in the movie The Wizard.
4901628	4904370	Well, that's what I had mentioned.
4904430	4906111	That was the only reason I saw that movie to begin with.
4907252	4913096	I think that was the motivation for a lot of us, was to see the first sneak peek at Super Mario Bros.
4913116	4913096	3!
4913196	4915217	What was that?
4915337	4915758	I know.
4915798	4917279	Remember the guy introducing it in the movie?
4917299	4918359	He made it sound all like holy.
4918379	4919220	It was great.
4920112	4921954	And now we're like, uh, yay?
4922935	4927859	But, um, well, the other thing that I thought was really cool about the game was the different, um, power-ups that you would get.
4928900	4938188	Um, you had your usual mushroom, you had your fire flower, but you also had, um, the, uh, raccoon tail that you could get.
4938249	4940911	That was always, like, my favorite to have ever.
4940951	4946476	You had your, you know, your power stars, and you had, um, you know, all your other mushrooms.
4947439	4957187	Um, the tanuki suit was fantastic, because you could also turn into, um, the monk statue, and the enemy would just ignore you for a little bit, except you really couldn't do that on the donut level.
4957587	4961210	You know what I mean by the donut level, where you'd run over the little donuts, and they would fall?
4961730	4963312	You couldn't do it on that level, because you'd die.
4964192	4969677	The other cool thing about the tanuki suit is if you turn into the statue while you're airborne, you'll land on something, and it'll kill it, and it's great.
4971098	4976262	Um, you also get the p-wing, which was, there's actually two items, there's a p-wing or an anchor,
4977023	4980065	And, um, you get those out of some of the toad houses.
4980826	4987910	And it's like, if you collect a certain number of coins on even number worlds, you would get the anchor.
4987930	4993174	If you did it on the odd worlds, then you would get, um, a, uh, T-Wing.
4993854	4994875	Or maybe it's the other way around.
4994975	4995275	Anyway.
4996235	4997236	So yeah, it was that way.
4997396	5002940	Um, also on, um, a couple of the places you could get a Hammer Brother suit, so you could go hammer.
5004141	5004701	And, um,
5005356	5012160	There was one fire brother that would, um, let you, uh... I'm being scared out by my husband.
5012841	5014381	The anchor was worthless.
5014562	5015902	Dan says the anchor was worthless.
5015942	5017924	Hammer brothers shoot rocks.
5018104	5019204	The anchor was worthless.
5019224	5019505	You know what?
5019605	5020265	I will tell you, though.
5020305	5022386	You know what pissed me off about power-ups, Jamie?
5022987	5023807	There was one more.
5024027	5024528	Okay, go ahead.
5025828	5027369	There was the Kuriko shoe.
5027549	5028470	That's what I was gonna say.
5028790	5033013	No, no, not just the fact that it was there, but what pissed me off, you could only use that damn shoe in one level.
5034190	5035010	I know.
5035870	5037571	It was the best level in the whole game.
5038111	5038431	You know what?
5038451	5039791	They should make... Go ahead.
5040752	5043352	There's also Warp Whistles, too, that made the Zelda noise.
5044273	5046813	They should make a game for the Wii called Kuriboh Shoe.
5047093	5047833	Everybody would buy it.
5049454	5050234	That would be great.
5050654	5054695	Well, there were some differences in the levels between the American and Japanese version.
5055835	5060697	Some were changed for matters of just... It caused the game to glitch.
5061677	5061937	Like...
5063308	5074257	In World 5, there was, in 5.1, you would have to go to a pipe to get to where the screen goes black and white, and it would actually cause the game to glitch up pretty bad.
5074637	5079501	Also, if you got hit in the Japanese version, no matter what power you had, you would go back to being small.
5081383	5085746	Whereas in the American one, you would just go to being super and then to being small.
5086227	5091151	Except with the Crudyville shoot, which was, you'd go back to being small in the Japanese version,
5091841	5096944	But in American One, you just go back to whatever power-up you had, then to Super, and then to Small.
5097624	5102807	Um, and the music for the game was done by, um, uh, Koji Kondo, who I got to meet.
5104788	5107429	And, um... He's the guy.
5107450	5107830	Yeah.
5108670	5110851	And, um, there were remakes.
5110871	5114413	There was the, um, Catella View version for Super Famicom.
5115434	5115534	Um...
5116477	5121798	This was basically the enhanced version that looked like Super Mario All-Stars, which, again, was another version.
5122519	5130801	And actually, Super Mario All-Stars had the version that came out actually retained some of the stuff that was in the Japanese version and not in the US one.
5131281	5140503	We also got Super Mario Advance 4, Super Mario 3, which was pretty cool and had stuff added and, you know, tried to spice it up a little bit.
5141187	5143448	And that was developed by Nintendo R&D 2.
5143488	5145369	Pretty cool.
5145449	5153731	There were e-reader extra levels that would extend the game, but they were really convoluted and hard to do, so it was like, people just said, ah, screw it, and didn't bother.
5153992	5155212	I don't even remember that.
5156232	5157833	They had Super Mario Bros.
5157893	5165396	3D, the Walmart cards, and some that came with the game, with Super Mario Advance 4.
5166216	5168917	The extensions were for the Advance version.
5169896	5194902	Um, but you had to have the e-reader, two DBAs, a link cable, and the card you wanted, and you would hook up the DBA with the cartridge, um, and the, the connector would go in the e-reader, and then you would do all this convoluted crap, and it was a big pain in the ass, and not, I mean, the levels were cool, and it really opened up, I think, a lot of potential to
5195905	5202411	I had almost infinite playability as long as people were willing to put up with the crap you had to do to use the e-reader.
5202791	5210218	But other than that, the whole e-reader thing sort of died out once they started upgrading the hardware.
5212033	5215534	Very interesting comment from Ranma in chat.
5215814	5217814	Nintendo, give us Super Mario Bros.
5218274	5217814	4.
5218695	5221895	You know, we never really have had just a plain Super Mario Bros.
5221935	5223236	game since Super Mario Bros.
5223256	5223236	3.
5223276	5228997	I mean, sure, there's been Mario World, there's been countless other games that have had Mario in it, but there's never ever been a Super Mario Bros.
5229017	5228997	4.
5230197	5232618	I think that World was technically 4.
5233778	5238699	I guess so, but it was also, you know... Because it still followed the same platform...
5239816	5244700	uh, format, it was, it was, I look at it as a direct successor to 3.
5246101	5246381	Hmm.
5246942	5250945	Even down to the world, down to power-ups, down to all the specials.
5251765	5262854	Um, and actually, if I do remember right, I think that the Super Mario World feather was actually the power-up in, um, uh, you could use that as a power-up in Mario 4 Advance.
5262874	5262934	Um,
5266371	5272694	I really think that Worlds could be considered... I think it's just that they decided to stop numbering them because it would get ridiculous and then fall into Street Fighter formula.
5272714	5273155	Oh, that was... Oh, yeah.
5273175	5274975	I was talking about Mario Advance 1 before.
5275035	5275916	But yeah, we did have that, I guess.
5291101	5293823	and me and the Mario and we had Lost Levels.
5294123	5295824	Not Lost Levels, but the All-Stars.
5296644	5297084	Alright.
5297364	5299466	Well, any other thoughts on Super Mario Bros.
5299486	5299466	3?
5301527	5311092	It was fun and I'm going to break out my top-loading Nintendo soon and play the hell out of it when I don't feel like I'm going to fall over and die.
5311272	5313153	Just don't use whistles because you know that's cheating.
5314266	5315266	No, it's not cheating.
5315286	5317227	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
5317307	5321869	We are going to have a discussion right here, right now about using the warp whistle.
5322229	5323449	It's not cheating.
5323509	5324930	They were in there for a reason.
5324950	5326991	They were programmed into the game.
5327071	5328431	It's not cheating.
5328471	5331833	But you've got to admit, it's so much more fun to play without warping.
5333933	5334474	Says you.
5334834	5337095	You don't get to play Big World if you warp.
5337175	5339195	Big World is the bomb.
5339275	5340276	Big World was the best.
5340376	5341036	I agree with that.
5341076	5343677	But you can warp to get ahead, to get right to Big World, you know.
5344281	5345062	You can go right there.
5345182	5346022	That's only half cheating.
5347563	5348584	It's not cheating at all.
5349405	5351026	It's like, okay, okay.
5351446	5354068	It was programmed into the game for a reason.
5354569	5355209	And you know what?
5355229	5355629	You know what?
5355669	5360653	I had the same argument with people who would say, oh, you can't use speed-ups on DDR either.
5361133	5365076	I was like, okay, go back and play Beat Mania without, you know, speed-ups.
5366457	5367378	It wasn't in the original.
5367438	5368459	All right, fine.
5368579	5369660	Warp all you want.
5369740	5370540	But I want Big World.
5371521	5372602	And the level with Kuriboh Shu.
5373254	5374194	They'll program more.
5374415	5374715	All right.
5376516	5380118	Jamie, we've got to wrap up Part A so we can get to Part B or we'll be here all night.
5380258	5380538	All right.
5380778	5384680	Any other quick things you wanted to share with the listeners before you're back here next week?
5387982	5389082	I really like sushi.
5389682	5390023	All right.
5390723	5391403	Enjoy your sushi.
5391443	5392444	I had good sushi for lunch.
5392764	5393064	All right.
5393184	5393444	Burp.
5393805	5394165	All right.
5394305	5395065	Take care, Jamie.
5396926	5397286	Okay.
5397346	5398147	Bye, Jamie.
5401162	5403703	For being tired, she sounds like she has a lot of energy left in her.
5403743	5405324	She talked for 10 minutes about Mario Bros.
5405644	5405324	3.
5406685	5408726	She's very passionate about that game.
5408846	5411367	It is probably one of the best games of all time.
5411567	5412427	I mean, you can't deny that.
5412948	5413868	I absolutely cannot.
5413888	5421151	I mean, if there is any classic game, I mean, just because y'all happen to have probably played this one doesn't make it a non-classic game.
5421191	5422872	It had to be the classic game of the week at some point.
5423112	5423472	Totally.
5423633	5424133	There you have it.
5424833	5428254	Alright, well that's going to do it for part A of our show.
5428894	5431375	So those of you guys listening on the podcast, we'll be back in a few days.
5431935	5438036	But for those of you guys listening live tonight on www.allgames.com, we'll be back in a few minutes with part B of our show.
