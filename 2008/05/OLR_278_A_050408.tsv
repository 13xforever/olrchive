127200	131400	disorganized tonight what you delicious mustard I don't know first the mics are
131400	134240	tangled in the problem is because she's sitting over here instead of sitting
134240	139120	over in Jamie's like abyss over there so well because of that I have to move this
139120	142200	stupid thing around the chair I want to get her scoot back we want to get her
142200	145880	pretty little face on cam even though the cam is kind of sucking tonight sorry
145880	150400	there all right how you doing I'm fine all right now except that mustard on me
150400	158800	how was your week outside of the goddamn mustard it was okay I went to Vegas how
158800	163480	was Vegas you went there for some type of like gaming demo or something right
163480	168840	yeah we went there too I don't know what you would really call I guess the gaming
168840	176400	expo we were the expo what's a Zappos you may remember them of the shoes and
176400	181400	apparel website they have like commercials now on TV and stuff so we
181400	185560	went there we got the tour and then we demoed games there which I got to play
185560	191080	you know quite a few of them because that's what I was doing is playing games
191080	195600	and basically you know just kind of teaching them the basics about games and
195600	199400	stuff just throwing some like facts out there for him basically just to get him
199400	204920	excited about games it was cool though they had a DDR supernova machine there
204920	212400	so I got to play that for a little bit and then what else did we play there we
212400	217080	had a Gran Turismo 5 prologue setup which I mean that game looks good but
217080	220220	you know I just never was really interested in the Gran Turismo series
220220	225080	but pretty I'll give them that and got to use the nice dual shocks and stuff so
225080	234240	all the rumbles which you know I guess that's neat then we also had set up
234240	239840	Mario Kart Wii so I finally used the Wii wheel instead of just you know
239840	244240	hooking it out the door be honest there's really hardly any difference
244240	248240	between the Wii wheel and just holding the controller sideways and I hate it I
248240	253840	absolutely hate it but we played you know that for a while and then I tried
253840	257200	also they had a well Halo 3 set up so I was playing a little bit of a death
257200	262200	match there that was fun Call of Duty 4 which I've played that before and that
262200	267480	looks nice we had Grand Theft Auto 4 set up because I brought my copy actually
267480	271040	with me I actually brought my 360 with me ironically enough that I didn't get
271040	276120	chance to actually play it in my hotel room at all so that kind of sucked but I
276120	279520	did play it at the event and I had already memorized a lot of the cheat
279520	283280	codes so I was just spawning helicopters and chopping people with the rotor
283280	287040	blades and stuff and just fun stuff like that and people seem to enjoy it then we
287040	291400	had Wii Sports being demoed you know pretty much everything from that and
291400	296280	Smash Brothers once again I had to play with it you know the controller sideways
296280	302520	which I hate it and I think that's it so that's what we were demoing for them and
302520	306360	they really enjoyed it and it's a great company to be honest I'd work there
306360	310840	tomorrow if I could but you know they're all the way in Henderson Nevada and we're
310840	317160	all the way out here in Sacramento but shit man if they were out here absolutely
317160	321040	awesome company just everyone loved working there they cater lunch and
321040	326360	breakfast every day they have vending machines full of stuff that's all free
326360	333520	just very fun going you know environment well since you were getting into your
333520	336120	gaming week why don't you tell us a little more about what other types of
336120	339480	games you've been playing this week anything outside of Vegas yes well more
339480	343840	Grand Theft Auto 4 we finally got our internet open at work so now we can
343840	347520	start doing the death matches online which is awesome very looking forward to
347520	351400	that I played a five minute death match with one of my co-workers and it was fun
351400	355240	it's pretty hard to spot people especially even with all the
355240	358560	pedestrians raining around because you know you do see their name above their
358560	362400	head and stuff but sometimes it's hard to spot on me amongst all the pedestrians
362400	366120	so that's pretty cool and then today we just kind of play the like a fuck-off
366120	370760	game you know it's a free play thing and that was fun it played that for about I
370760	375840	think a good half hour 45 minutes and just you know flying around helicopters
375840	380400	and just you know fucking around running for the police it was really fun it
380400	385800	really I really want to get more into the multiplayer in this game that's for
385800	390040	sure in the single-player version of the game is pretty fun too I've been doing
390040	394320	more of the missions and stuff and kind of along in the stories starting to you
394320	400040	know come around a bit so I'm very you know looking forward to this game a lot
400040	403760	I'm just worried though that because even like flying to the different
403760	408240	islands and stuff it's like okay now I've seen everything and you know I
408240	412680	don't know but I think it's still very confusing stuff driving around you don't
412680	417080	you know it's hard to orient yourself a little bit more than say the other games
417080	422000	because there's a lot less than those other games but it's a good game
422000	425880	definitely a good game and see what else they play Oh crisis core played that a
425880	431320	little bit on the plane I really can't get in that game very much it's too
431320	436080	linear just really because people have just been like you know swooning all
436080	440480	about crisis core some kind of surprise it's very linear I mean if you don't get
440480	446320	a lot of place I mean you can go explore a little bit but it's very empty I don't
446320	450680	know it's just I maybe I'm not that far into the game maybe not far enough to
450680	453360	where the game just shifts to where you can run around anywhere and do whatever
453360	460040	but it's just very linear and just empty even more so than like the other but
460040	464200	that's kind of typical for like a PSP game though they're usually very sparse
464200	468680	because they can't handle them any polygons on the screen stuff but that
468680	471400	might be the first negative thing I've heard about crisis core it's just I
471400	475680	can't get into it I want to get into it because it looks really cool but we got
475680	479160	to get to the chat room for comments chat orange lounge radio.com if you want
479160	482500	to join us or if you're on the game surge network where the all games chat
482500	486240	room also is we're in our own chat room at channel orange lounge and first
486240	491320	comment tonight from act theft he says more like crisis bore that is that what
491320	497840	it is then I mean I actually instead of playing the game on my you know flight
497840	501640	back I decided to read the sky mall magazine that gives you an idea I chose
501640	508200	the sky ball magazine over crisis core sky ball has some pretty sweet stuff and
508200	511520	they do have some pretty interesting things in there they had some things I
511520	518760	was like hey that's a pretty cool idea good times anything else um I played
518760	523880	something else oh I was playing this web flash game it's for Castle Crashers but
523880	529440	you're fighting a guy with a beard what is a giant head with a beard wait it's
529440	533120	it's a demo for Castle Crashers no it's like a flash game that the guy that
533120	537000	created Castle Crashers made with the character okay also Crashers and you're
537000	541680	fighting the guy the beard interesting it I can't remember the name of it I'll
541680	547040	find it but uh it was interesting all righty I never say this name right I
547040	551720	apologize this poor guy oh we too says Loki is reviewing a game but nothing
551720	557600	compares to his beloved Grand Theft Auto 4 is that true I mean it's good I just
557600	561120	enjoyed a lot more I don't know it's not I'm not seeing that it's better than any
561120	565440	game out there it's just I'm enjoying it a lot more right now I mean what's he
565440	569960	throw to comes out who knows I mean awesome that probably awesome for
569960	573040	completely disagrees with you says crisis core is the downright best game
573040	578280	on the PSP I don't know about that all right what would you say is the best
578280	583720	game on the PSP out of can I see played so far yeah you know I'd probably have
583720	588560	to say grant that thought of I knew it I knew it just just because I played a lot
588560	593880	of that game it's just it's fun but you know I don't know if they put like Final
593880	598520	Fantasy 7 like the actual 7 on there I would probably say that would be pretty
598520	603840	fun and Final Fantasy 1 on the PSP was pretty fun so I don't know just maybe
603840	609240	some more of the retro games I guess I like stuff well I'll say like I liked
609240	614240	Space Invaders extreme I really like that game but that game did seem like a lot
614240	618080	of fun with the few minutes I played the one you had any of I that's something
618080	621560	they need to bring to live in like the PlayStation Network seriously that would
621560	625200	do so well for them but Space Invaders extreme by the way like if you like
625200	631200	those like music Gucci games like resin stuff or every extend extra like mix
631200	634080	that with Space Invaders that's what Space Invaders extreme is it's pretty
634080	640920	hot because I am a huge like Loki is to Grand Theft Auto I love music Gucci like
640920	645400	I everything he touches I will do felt like I even defended 99 nights okay like
645400	650440	I'll admit it wait what you say that I don't even know what that 99 nights came
650440	654160	out of the Xbox 360 and it was kind of the what's the game is just like thank
654160	657920	you dynasty warriors but it had its issues but I came on the show and I was
657920	667320	like it's not a bad game it just needs a little work so we all have our things we
667320	674880	get fanboy over what do you get fanboy over rice princess or fangirl I don't
674880	678720	really have anything currently that I get all like mmm over anymore just the
678720	685040	typical like Nintendo franchises what about Chrono Trigger oh okay cuz I seem
685040	687560	to remember a few weeks ago on this program I took a lot of heat for not
687560	692600	declaring okay Chrono Trigger is great didn't care too much about Chrono Cross
692600	696280	didn't wasn't really impressed by that Chrono Trigger remake they were doing
696280	702400	the 3d one what okay that's not a 3d child I am like strictly a 2d type of
702400	705800	person all right that's why I didn't care for it but yeah I'm kind of a
705800	709240	boring person when it comes you like your games very two-dimensional and
709240	713560	vanilla totally yeah what about the 2d games with that 3d kind of look to them
713560	718000	like I don't know beautiful Joe kind of that's see that's cool with me and it's
718000	722400	not okay it's it's case by case it's not strictly I won't play any 3d games I
722400	727900	play 3d games it's just my preference I feel that they put more effort into the
727900	731320	game when it's 2d because they're not focusing on trying to make it look all
731320	736520	cool because it's 3d I don't know I just Super Nintendo forever comments from
736520	740480	chat siren says and I'm probably another name I'm mispronouncing but you know
740480	744440	what I do that I'm mispronouncing it's amateur radio says Chrono Trigger equals
744440	748240	not that great oh you equals not that great
748240	753360	awesome first says 99 nights I remember being reviewed on x-play with a girl
753360	758560	screaming horribly I remember watching x-play and I was screaming horribly
758560	763400	you're such a dork all right well how was your gaming way what kind of games
763400	766400	have you been playing this week I'm assuming Loki's done if he's not I cut
766400	771960	him off what how was your gaming week I'm done boring I played Wow and I
771960	778160	started playing puzzle pirates again nerd okay if for whatever reason let's
778160	781160	say a listener the show has never heard of puzzle pirates before is it a free
781160	786720	MMO okay it went from beta to charge and now they have kind of this system where
786720	791360	you can play for free and then like buy certain aspects of the game with real
791360	795320	money like if you want to have Johnny Depp hair you got a yeah exactly yeah
795320	799120	like clothes or an island or something like that you can pay for it but
799120	802920	essentially it's just a big puzzle game if you've ever played something like
802920	805660	puzzle quest or something it's kind of sort of like that but in a pirate
805660	811000	setting you sail the ship by playing a puzzle you build the stations you do
811000	814920	carpentry all that crap you know but they're all like pop cap games basically
814920	817880	because building is like bejeweled right yeah yeah it's pretty much like one of
817880	822600	them was like dr. Mario yeah I think it was a sailing one yeah yeah but yeah
822600	826640	it's basically what it is but it's fun and it's addictive and like it is like
826640	831560	it's like pop cap the MMO with pirates exactly that is exactly what it is
831560	836280	that's a great description so but it's really fun and I like have been spending
836280	839080	countless hours playing I know a few people have really gotten sucked into
839080	841800	puzzle pirates yeah a few people on my live journal on the friends list they
841800	846160	just always talk about you know puzzle pirates it's good time it's like Wow for
846160	853600	the puzzle crowd I guess you could say all right yeah pretty cool my gaming
853600	856960	week I must be I feel like the one person on the planet who has not been
856960	861640	all getting into Grand Theft Auto 4 here's my thing I like I respect let me
861640	865640	put this I respect Grand Theft Auto 4 I think it is a good game but it's just
865640	869920	not kind of like my thing like I have this big concern I'm gonna spend $60 in
869920	873080	this game and I don't really play Grand Theft Auto for the story because I'm
873080	877440	just not into those types of stories and I think I would have a lot of fun
877440	881120	running around for like three hours and blowing everything up I possibly can and
881120	884480	shooting people in the face but then I think it would kind of get old for me
884480	887920	but I don't know the online modes make me think maybe I'd have a little more
887920	890960	fun with it so I'm still kind of on the fence I want to wait for the game to
890960	893920	come down in price but we all know that's not gonna happen for a long long
893920	898720	time long time but you see long time you say that about it but I mean it's kind
898720	905040	of like Wow you do the exact same thing over and over there's something more Wow
905040	909440	has a chat room I can't explain it yeah I guess that's a good point but I mean
909440	916040	I've always said game Wow Wow is a giant chat room with spells like basically you
916040	920000	know kind of true but I mean like there is gonna be the you know there's the
920000	923600	online element to it and I don't know you would just I think if you pick it up
923600	927160	and play it you might get more into it than you actually think you would Rob
927160	932520	it's just me there well J rod says why doesn't sky just borrow it from Loki
932520	936800	does he keep it in a fireproof safe guarded by pit bulls or something no I
936800	942400	think it's not a fireproof safe it's the safety deposit box that came with my you
942400	945800	know my special edition plus I would I would think that Loki just wants to hang
945800	948480	on to it for a little while he'll probably let me borrow it in like six
948480	952160	weeks well I can't let you borrow because I have to use it at work when we
952160	957760	play our weekly death match early death matches so I mean I have four copies of
957760	962440	the game right now you gotta let that Loki has four copies of the game and he
962440	967520	won't let me borrow one five we have five people that want to play it at work
967520	972160	and in fact I need to get another copy of it it's fine it's fine like I said I
972160	977800	will buy it eventually I don't know when that's going to be he's only got four
977800	982920	copies Rob I will find you one shit God it's all good don't worry about it I
982920	986960	don't know why you know me you know I gotta play one of the best games of you
986960	990560	know you're gonna find it for me I'm gonna play it for three hours and then
990560	996280	Irene's gonna call and be all like Rob Cara's and and I I'll be like bye grand
996280	1000200	theft auto I'll load it to you and then just like I haven't had a chance to play
1000200	1006800	I've been playing World of Warcraft like three weeks later hey so how do you like
1006800	1012440	grants I was out of four I still haven't played it yet I'm running her I decided
1012440	1016400	to go back to Final Fantasy 11 for a little bit you don't understand slave
1016400	1022360	pens was the daily heroic I had to do it and then survivor came back on TV so I
1022360	1026720	have to watch that don't even joke about survivor right now you know I'm tangent
1026720	1029680	I'm hosting an online survivor you because I'll tell you what one thing I
1029680	1032960	love besides video game is cheesy reality shows and I'm actually hosting a
1032960	1037520	survivor game online right now and the cast that's playing is very fierce it's
1037520	1041680	live journal survivor and I played it like last year and it was a lot of fun
1041680	1046160	and the cast is in it right now funny I'm having so much fun watching them
1046160	1048540	just kind of like because I get to see everything they write behind this it's
1048540	1055560	funny I'm having a great time I don't know how much I can say because some of
1055560	1059200	them might be listening but I'll just say everybody is definitely there to win
1059200	1063640	so it's fun it's fun to watch I hope it's much better than that you know
1063640	1067040	there was like a survivor PC game that came out like I think there were two of
1067040	1071840	them that came out total shit total shit yeah one of them you could actually play
1071840	1075840	online and you could actually be one of like you could be Richard Hatch oh like
1075840	1082000	not pay your taxes Wow so look I make no apologies for things that I might like

1202840	1206840	alone you that one how nice alright what I did want to play for you guys as I
1206840	1209880	promised last week I said we got a really great entry from somebody who
1209880	1213520	unfortunately is ineligible because for reasons beyond our control namely the
1213520	1217800	fact that the limited edition console that is the grand prize only works in
1217800	1220880	the United States or North American regions I should say Canada Mexico are
1220880	1225920	fine but it will not work in Europe okay we had to say you know North American
1225920	1229760	residents only so unfortunately this guy was ineligible but I think the commercial
1229760	1235000	is so damn funny I want you guys to hear it so this is Martin from Belgium and
1235000	1238760	this is his entry for the contest that unfortunately is ineligible we wanted to
1238760	1242240	play it on the show because it's so great introducing Loki's world of
1242240	1247680	randomness do you have no free time are you tired of raising your children are
1247680	1252640	your children little pussies getting beat up just drop them in front of the
1252640	1257600	TV with Loki's world of randomness run around a virtual world in a bingle
1257600	1262240	outfit while performing random acts it will teach your children important
1262240	1271480	skills such as how to attach a laser to their pet cat disembodied heads how to
1271480	1278400	take pictures of guys kissing or how to shout fuck a combination of all of the
1278400	1283040	above if your children suffer mental damage from playing this game or start
1283040	1289560	killing their friends with their laser cats it may result in a bonus lawsuit
1289560	1294920	settlement from our legal department this game is approved by wappy play.com
1294920	1302600	rated r4 retarded perfect that is a perfect example of an entry it was
1302600	1307760	beautiful it might have damn well won if Martin was eligible but he's not so
1307760	1310760	what's going to happen is that we're going to pick our favorites like three
1310760	1314040	four finalists I don't know depends on the entries we get you can still submit
1314040	1317320	them by the way you have like five and a half hours so if you haven't submitted
1317320	1321040	anything yet you have time because you have to midnight Pacific tonight to get
1321040	1324360	your entries in so you can send those in mailbag orange on twitter.com if you're
1324360	1328220	listening right now if you're listening on the podcast you're screwed so if you
1328220	1330640	want to submit it in you have like five and a half hours I'll tell you what you
1330640	1334560	don't have a lot of competition because only like a handful of people did it so
1334560	1338000	I guess not that many people want the limited edition one in a grand theft auto
1338000	1341040	god I don't know I'll tell you it's because they know that I'm going to win
1341040	1346520	you're ineligible asshole all right so anyway but I will say there are some
1346520	1350520	other good ones too we will play our favorites in a special podcast that will
1350520	1354320	roll out sometime this week you guys can vote for them on our site www.orange

1360360	1365400	orange on twitter.com good times so that winner will be announced next week's
1365400	1370200	show and also did anyone else notice this is slow news week this week thanks
1370200	1375880	to grand theft auto for what I see you're smiling evilly over there I is
1375880	1381680	it just me that noticed it was a slow news week I don't know no no I didn't
1381680	1385160	notice well because I was too busy playing grand that's why I thought my
1385160	1389200	gaming weeks as I skipped it earlier really not a whole lot of new stuff
1389200	1393160	because actually I haven't been playing wow a lot lately I kind of took a break
1393160	1397000	from Wow one game I have been playing quite a lot of and I kind of surprised
1397000	1400720	myself as Mario Kart Wii I've actually been having a lot of fun with Mario Kart
1400720	1404760	Wii I don't play with the wheel either I think the wheel is kind of stupid and it
1404760	1409480	doesn't control well for me so I use the nunchuck and wiimote which works great I
1409480	1413600	really like controlling it that way and I was actually playing online for like
1413600	1417760	an hour or two today and I was having a lot of fun just playing against the
1417760	1420800	random people because you know how online you don't have a lot of control
1420800	1425880	but at least the online you notice for Nintendo is starting to slowly inch by
1425880	1430920	inch get a little better slowly because at least this time it kind of introduces
1430920	1433680	you to the other players you're about to battle and like shows you where they're
1433680	1437400	from and you actually get to see their me's and their name unlike kind of like
1437400	1441240	Smash Brothers ball was like brawl was like completely you know anonymous at
1441240	1443640	least this time you get to know a little bit about the people you're going up
1443640	1446840	against and you can play with friends like the other night we were playing on
1446840	1450560	myself and my roommate were playing against miklotov remember him from the
1450560	1453880	show he he's lives in Kansas now we were playing against him on the internet and
1453880	1457160	the cool thing is you can have two people playing on one console and he
1457160	1461280	kicked our ass ten times in a row I was so mad but I was still a dumb noob so
1461280	1464040	that's what I chalk it up to but we're just having a lot of fun with the online
1464040	1468360	I actually think online is kind of fun you know obviously the lack of voice
1468360	1472200	chat and the lack of a deep decent friend code system I mean nothing new
1472200	1477280	that no one hasn't said about Nintendo before but it's getting a little better
1477280	1484680	a little baby steps Nintendo's making baby steps so but I phone Mario Kart we
1484680	1489220	and some of the courses are amazing like I love the Koopa cape which is that
1489220	1492840	level that's like the kind of like the island one with all the rivers and then
1492840	1496320	you go you actually go down into a pipe for part of it and you're like driving
1496320	1499760	through the pipe and then you come out it's awesome so I really like some of
1499760	1503520	the course design in Mario Kart we I kind of wish there was more of them
1503520	1507880	j-rod and chat asks hey sky whatever happened the Lost Odyssey you ever
1507880	1512800	finished that four-disc behemoth um no you know I got towards the end of the
1512800	1515840	first disc I think I know I'm on the second disc a Lost Odyssey actually and
1515840	1522440	then Irene called and was like Rob Karazhan and that was the end the Lost
1522440	1525240	Odyssey no I that's the game I really really do need to go back and beat
1525240	1530720	because it was amazing amazing story alright now we can get into tonight's
1530720	1536800	news hooray I'll start tonight speaking of the Nintendo we there is a special
1536800	1541520	version of the we that is soon going to roll out to hotels it's actually going
1541520	1545880	to be at the Westin hotels Westin's is a pretty upscale chain of hotels I was
1545880	1549280	fortunate enough to stay in one in San Francisco once they're really nice kind
1549280	1553400	of swanky hotels they're actually going to be putting wheeze in their workout
1553400	1558720	rooms it's like a we workout okay or Westin workout is the program and then
1558720	1561920	the wheeze is going to be in this here's the interesting thing the wheeze that
1561920	1565440	they're going to be getting the games are in there automatically no discs are
1565440	1569680	required so I'm assuming it's you know on the limited space that's in there and
1569680	1574300	the hotel or is good they're going to slowly add things like we fit and we
1574300	1579640	sports apparently this whole thing is kind of quote ideal for business
1579640	1583800	travelers and families who want to stay energized while on the road that's a
1583800	1588560	quote from the press release that was put out by Nintendo and Westin earlier
1588560	1592840	this week so what do you think interesting kind of interesting you
1592840	1596440	don't see video games and workout rooms very often but it just kind of goes to
1596440	1602840	show that whole like you know the whole we is an exercise machine craze that's
1602840	1605840	going on though I don't know how many calories do you really lose playing we
1605840	1611400	sport I know that you know it depends on how much you play I guess really I guess
1611400	1614440	being a little bit active is being better than not active at all but
1614440	1618440	exactly it's just kind of hard for me to kind of picture a we standing next to a
1618440	1620960	treadmill when you know damn well you're gonna burn more calories on that
1620960	1625000	treadmill yeah that is true but it makes it more fun and more interactive I mean
1625000	1629720	like and I don't know boxing have you played boxing like a few times in a row
1629720	1633360	yeah okay the boxing yeah I gotta get give that to you that definitely does
1633360	1636200	tell you figure out actually how to play the boxing game realize that all you
1636200	1642240	just flick your wrist and shut up Loki no but um no I think that's a pretty
1642240	1647320	cool idea I mean I'd probably rather play that than hop on the treadmill or
1647320	1651440	lift a bunch of weights you know or something Frisbee asks but what person
1651440	1655080	is gonna put play Twilight Princess in a hotel workout room well I don't think
1655080	1657960	that'll be one of the games that's on it because they said you can't put discs in
1657960	1661760	here so I'm assuming it's going to be games like you know we sports and we fit
1661760	1665000	in the more active type games yeah I don't if it's gonna be in the workout
1665000	1669120	room why would they put Twilight Frisbee in our chat also says just put a DDR
1669120	1674880	machine in there that's that's true why not idea DDR has been around for what 10
1674880	1678320	years now you haven't heard about that going into workout rooms although DDR is
1678320	1682160	kind of gone into the mainstream in other places such as school physical
1682160	1685560	fitness programs we've heard a lot about yeah it's kind of interesting yeah that's
1685560	1689840	really not a bad how about DDR on the Wii that's like you know workout times
1689840	1697040	too yeah right totally I think it's also uber lame me you were not a fan of DDR
1697040	1702800	on the Wii it's stupid it's like oh hey you remember how much how awesome hands
1702800	1707840	and feet mode was in the PlayStation 2 DDR's yeah let's bring that to the Wii
1707840	1712320	simple do with the Wii remote oh guess what it still sucks that's right I
1712320	1716960	didn't think it was that bad oh crap because it's randomly thrown in there
1716960	1720120	just for the fuck of it and you look like an idiot doing that you don't have
1720120	1722960	to play with that in there I understand that you know so they'll have to play
1722960	1726600	with hands and feet mode but the thing is a couple things that was disappointing
1726600	1731080	about one you couldn't add up your own edit steps using the hands and feet mode
1731080	1737120	or you know the Wii remote and stuff like that and to just their placement
1737120	1742760	in the songs as they were it's just kind of random so I don't know it just didn't
1742760	1747640	really flow with the song at all so all right it was just like hey look you're
1747640	1750680	burning more calories awesome yeah I do want to say one other thing about this
1750680	1754560	story before we move on the Westin workout is only going to be at 10 hotels
1754560	1757200	across the United States I mean obviously there's workout rooms and all
1757200	1760840	their hotels I'm sure but this we think is only in 10 hotels for now so I'm
1760840	1764640	assuming it's in the big cities in New York San Francisco whatever I'm assuming
1764640	1768600	this will roll out slowly to more and more hotels if it's successful but we'll
1768600	1772880	see because totally I'm not gonna stay at a hotel unless it has the Wii there
1772880	1776960	well you know if you got a big family maybe those are types of things you look
1776960	1781840	for or how about this I don't know if you're vacationing how about you just go
1781840	1786840	outside and go visit places of interest and get your exercise that way and stay
1786840	1790680	up like hey let's go to a hotel and go exercise in their exercise room okay
1790680	1794640	can't do that at home imagine you're a big you're gonna have kids someday Loki
1794640	1797440	you got married right and you're gonna have kids someday that's the long-term
1797440	1803640	plan and my kids will understand how retarded shut up hold on is the thing is
1803640	1807200	is that you're gonna be going out and let's say you know you go on a trip to
1807200	1810880	Disneyland or whatever you're gonna be out at Disneyland all fucking day you
1810880	1814160	and Ellie are gonna be tired as hell when you get back to the hotel and
1814160	1817560	you're gonna want to go just die you know in the couch and watch TV or
1817560	1822200	whatever but the kids they have energy nothing but energy so what better than
1822200	1826040	for them to go to the workout room and burn some more of that energy yeah
1826040	1829320	because the kids totally want to go to the workout room I can remember when I
1829320	1832360	went to Disneyland I was like hell let's go to the workout room this would be so
1832360	1835880	awesome instead of like hey let's go down the arcade downstairs or I don't
1835880	1839520	know hey let's go out to the pool I go around some or hey let's go run around
1839520	1844840	or hey how about we play some video games on the TV there I hope your kids
1844840	1848960	are twice as angry as you they're seriously gonna go are they fucking
1848960	1853200	serious they want us to go work out downstairs are you fucking crazy you
1853200	1856640	call me I'll be like shut up Billy you're only five you can't talk back to
1856640	1862120	me like that you're grounded I hope you really do name your kid Billy okay this
1862120	1865680	is great act deaf thank you act deaf just backing me up here a little bit act
1865680	1871040	deaf says Loki this is probably made for busy businessmen and women that go to
1871040	1876680	places but not actually visit the place excellent point oh so it says in the
1876680	1880600	press release oh well that makes all the difference why don't they just get some
1880600	1886880	work done instead and like okay I do this I'm a business traveler I go teach
1886880	1890200	in other places sometimes I haven't done it for a while sometimes I go to LA or
1890200	1893560	I go to you know wherever and I don't get put up at the Westin but if if I was
1893560	1897340	the president of the company I might okay I might actually get a kick out of
1897340	1901800	this all right fine go get a kick out of this I hope it's worth all the thousands
1901800	1906600	of dollars that they probably had to pay for it to be exclusive there or I'm
1906600	1911320	done I'm done I want to move on new subject well another disappointing idea
1911320	1918520	was the idea to remove clovers credits from the Okami we version not surprised
1918520	1921680	that clover has been kind of getting the shaft ever since you know they were
1921680	1932840	disbanded but kind of that he said shaft yes I said shaft that's right shaft so
1932840	1937240	you know it's not a big surprise that with the Wii version of the game coming
1937240	1942280	out hell let's just get it even sloppier and other than putting watermarks on our
1942280	1946040	covers let's just remove their they didn't really work on the game it's all
1946040	1951760	Capcom according to the new game now as I understand it their defense for taking
1951760	1955920	out the thing was that well clovers not around anymore and the logo was in this
1955920	1960360	movie file that we couldn't get the logo out of so we took out the whole movie
1960360	1964520	file that was their defense they couldn't get the logo out of the movie
1964520	1967800	file yes because they did not have the raw movie file from clover because
1967800	1972920	clovers gone wow that was there I swear to god I'm not making out that was the
1972920	1978000	excuse wow that's pretty retarded hell I could get the movie file from just a
1978000	1982240	fucking video of it it's called script print screen folks print screen you put
1982240	1986640	the movie file up and you take a screen capture and then you can crop it down of
1986640	1989440	course I guess you wouldn't know how to do that since you came fucking find a
1989440	1995200	picture without a watermark it's just fucking lazy whiz Capcom gotten really
1995200	1998960	lazy lately I mean seriously you know with all the fucking Megaman games and
1998960	2001700	shit that they've got coming out in Street Fighter remakes and fucking
2001700	2005600	remakes of other games do they have an original idea left with them I mean
2005600	2010840	seriously whatever it's Okami it's been out before buy it now because you're a
2010840	2014240	whore and you'll buy these stupid remakes if there is nothing different
2014240	2018960	with the game other than it's ad waggle so I hope you enjoy your fucking ps2
2018960	2024240	port that really had that rant had nothing to do with the credits getting
2024240	2028640	cut well it sucks for clover because God hand was awesome
2028640	2033800	Okami haven't played it comments from chat any any quick thoughts rice
2033800	2039080	princess before we go to chat not at all awesome for a chat says clover got
2039080	2043440	shanked on that deal they made the game they went out of business but WTF they
2043440	2048180	should still get the credit act-def says Capcom were lazy siren says Capcom
2048180	2054240	quickly make Marvel vs. Capcom 3 chat orange on radio calm okay I'm just just
2054240	2059700	so you know they have on joystick an actual video that was part of the end
2059700	2066120	credit sequence you know with clovers no logo in there and for one I don't see
2066120	2070280	why they couldn't just I don't know keep that video sequence since it's pretty

2137920	2144320	watermark all right moving on talking about other we news it's a pretty
2144320	2147720	exciting developments in the virtual console world especially if you are in

2180320	2183240	if you don't know what Cho Aniki is you're just gonna have to look it up on
2183240	2190200	Wikipedia or something to understand its awesomeness awesomely badness that's
2190200	2194040	pretty cool I want more Japanese games I like the last set of games they had that

2207400	2212920	upcoming festival for PAL regions so enjoy well mother fans are gonna like
2212920	2218560	this earthbound has been now rated by the ESRB for the Wii virtual console so
2218560	2224560	you can uh you know actually get to play mother to here pretty soon and no word
2224560	2229280	on yet when it's coming out but probably pretty soon since it just hasn't been
2229280	2235480	rated and of course there are some other games other than earthbound that have
2235480	2243640	been rated as well some of these including super dodgeball which is not a
2243640	2247600	big surprise since I believe dodgeball brawlers is coming out here on the DS
2247600	2257120	pretty soon samurai showdown 2 metal slug and Donkey Kong Country 3 Rob what's
2257120	2261800	that you need to get earthbound and you actually should finish it I should I I
2261800	2265540	do love earthbound you know I don't know why I just because I always rented the
2265540	2268200	game I never actually owned the game I always rented it and they never just I
2268200	2272120	always ran out of time to finish it but I love it totally like an adult and
2272120	2276240	you've been one for like a long time so you shouldn't like go well you're
2276240	2281200	totally like a bitch and you've been one for a long time so you should like it
2281200	2285760	you should like actually finish games Rob I know it's I have look I've told
2285760	2291680	the listeners about this before I have gaming a DD I start a game and then
2291680	2295180	another game comes out and I go shiny and I throw the other game at a deep
2295180	2297960	dark closet and I start playing the new game and then something else comes out
2297960	2301400	and it's a cycle I've total gamer a DD and by the way he means World of
2301400	2307640	Warcraft yes that old game but he throws into the closet not even this is you
2307640	2310680	know what not even necessarily World of Warcraft me I haven't played it and you
2310680	2315120	know I took like a week and a half off the game so you know once in a while you
2315120	2320120	know I go into console mode or whatever so I know that's kind of sad I've kind
2320120	2325000	of drifted from consoles in the past few years I used to be like totally pro
2325000	2329160	console and like kind of sort of anti PC but now it's kind of switched I'm not
2329160	2332520	anti console but I just don't play console but the only PC game you're
2332520	2339760	playing is World of Warcraft and puzzle pirates my bad yeah this is why World of
2339760	2343260	Warcraft doesn't come out for consoles it's it's keeping PC gaming alive it is
2343260	2347120	PC gaming I should say I'm gonna get angry emails from PC gamers and there
2347120	2350960	well there obviously is much more but obviously World of Warcraft is the
2350960	2354700	behemoth you can't deny that but there are games come to come in on the turn
2354700	2362360	pack like spore that are gonna be the same thing so you know we're probably I
2362360	2365680	don't know like this isn't in the show role because I couldn't find the actual
2365680	2370800	story for it but I mentioned this to you last night how that they have found a
2370800	2373720	way now since you know they've completely ripped apart the virtual
2373720	2377040	console they know how to pirate all the games now and stuff now they figured out
2377040	2380480	how to put games into the virtual console I heard about this how does it
2380480	2386400	work basically with you know it's kind of like the Xbox 360 and how they
2386400	2391600	emulates the Xbox games each virtual console game has an emulator built in
2391600	2394880	with it so what they're basically doing is keeping the emulator in there and
2394880	2399880	then stripping out the ROM and throwing another ROM in there so it would run off
2399880	2405160	that emulator and so it works on they've done it with pilot wing 64 Smash
2405160	2411080	Brothers and some other stuff but I was thinking you know hey you know the
2411080	2415880	potential for this you can Guardian legends you could do you know Super
2415880	2419480	Mario RPG pretty much anything that's on the virtual console and they've done it
2419480	2423240	like I think they've extracted ROMs or put ROMs from other games that are on
2423240	2429600	other regions into the u.s. ones I think basically just I don't know what'll
2429600	2434120	happen is you'll see the logo and stuff for whatever game it originally was
2434120	2438400	because I haven't figured out how to change that yet but with the rate that
2438400	2443600	they're going right now that won't be long but it's just it's very interesting
2443600	2448480	how much they've before this was all secure and now it's just poof like night
2448480	2453320	and day just cracked completely open but uh you know I'm looking forward to like
2453320	2456720	Guardian legend or something blaster master or something like that on a to
2456720	2461760	put blaster master on my Wii be awesome oh man but are you worried that there's
2461760	2464720	going to be a Nintendo patch that comes out that shuts this whole thing off and
2464720	2468920	possibly bricks consoles that did it I don't think that they can do that worry
2468920	2472760	brick consoles and the other thing too is it's going to be hard for them to
2472760	2477880	detect this stuff because they can see they can detect what virtual console
2477880	2483960	games you you have bought they know that but like if you say for example pirate
2483960	2487080	one of these games and throw it on there it doesn't detect that it's actually on
2487080	2492080	the console it's just data that's on there so it would be hard for them to do
2492080	2496720	that and also who's to say that you couldn't buy legitimate game like by you
2496720	2501160	know Super Mario Brothers 2 or something like that and then go back delete that
2501160	2504600	inject something into the Super Mario Brothers 2 file so it still looks like
2504600	2508640	you have Super Mario Bros 2 but really is like guardian legend or something so
2508640	2512360	I mean I don't know it's just interesting
2512360	2516520	totient and chat says injecting ROMs is lame by the damn virtual console titles
2516520	2520000	thanks well what if they're not out yet what if you keep waiting for me you just
2520000	2522960	don't want to wait and who's to say that you couldn't buy them later on when they
2522960	2527560	actually come out but now you're playing them it'll be interesting to see how
2527560	2534600	long it takes Nintendo to cut this off frisbee says Mario RPG anyone totient
2534600	2539520	says then buy them when they get out so I guess that would be okay moving on to
2539520	2542600	non virtual console related things and talking about other types of games for
2542600	2547240	the Wii and yes we play Xbox 360 and ps3 too it just so happens a lot of we news
2547240	2552960	this week boogie is apparently going to be getting a sequel boogie superstar has
2552960	2558320	apparently been slated for October it's been spotted on some websites out there
2558320	2562040	for shopping I guess like game I don't know they don't say exactly where but
2562040	2567160	I'm assuming it's either like game flyer game stop one of those October 14th is
2567160	2571720	apparently going to be the release date boogie the first one wasn't really that
2571720	2575480	critically heralded but I guess it did okay out there in the marketplace I
2575480	2579760	imagine the engine since it's been built it's probably not that hard to inject
2579760	2583920	new songs and I know there's a new my sims game coming out they saw some
2583920	2589800	details on it's like my sims mmm I say like medieval fantasy or something like
2589800	2593480	that it's like said in medieval times but it sounds just like Animal Crossing
2593480	2598000	now like they're ripping that off big time oh well won't be long speaking of
2598000	2602160	games like boogie completely random tangent karaoke revolution because I was
2602160	2604900	thinking about games where they don't change a lot from game to game but the
2604900	2609160	song list karaoke revolution right you remember that game okay I saw a movie
2609160	2612320	this week baby mama which was like you know I think was like the number one
2612320	2615320	movie the box office last week I'm sure it's not anymore thanks to Ironman but
2615320	2619800	you know baby mama came out karaoke revolution is like a plot device in the
2619800	2623040	movie it's there's actually like a whole scene where they're playing karaoke
2623040	2625780	revolution together and kind of like I don't want to spoil it but you know kind
2625780	2629260	of bonding over karaoke revolution they're actually like explaining how to
2629260	2633280	play the game and I'm like is this product placement like that's what it
2633280	2636720	felt like to me I'm like the Konami by product placement in this movie or is
2636720	2640360	this really like just that much a part of pop culture and I was thinking well
2640360	2645040	why did they not use sing star hmm conspiracy I don't know but I thought
2645040	2649360	that was actually kind of interesting have you played boogie I have not played
2649360	2653800	boogie I've seen videos online I've heard from friends about it that's it I
2653800	2659080	actually played boogie at a mutual friend's birthday party it was kind of
2659080	2664360	it was okay I mean there was nothing special about it it was I mean it was
2664360	2668840	just like karaoke revolution I think I there was like something where you can
2668840	2672160	make a music video of it or you can like edit you know the words or something
2672160	2676760	like that like to make it fancy but it's it kind of felt like something that was
2676760	2681880	more palatable to two kids or something I don't know I don't know why as a lot
2681880	2686320	of Wii games are yeah but I don't know I just didn't I wasn't thinking like oh
2686320	2691080	this game needs a sequel they should make one you know when I played it so I
2691080	2694720	think that's kind of weird but whatever I guess it was they got enough money
2694720	2699840	from it so all right well sequel coming soon well something that's a little bit
2699840	2704840	different that's being tested out right now in the Wii homebrew community is USB
2704840	2711480	mass storage support and they just released the source code for USB mass
2711480	2718240	storage device demo which right now only handles basic error handling and just
2718240	2722800	some basic features but eventually what they're hoping to do with this is allow
2722800	2728560	the USB support from the console to be able to use like memory sticks flash
2728560	2736440	drives mp3 players you know and fat formatted USB hard drives and I don't
2736440	2741800	know very interesting that you know kind of like what we saw with the PSP where
2741800	2747840	they're adding features to the system that aren't yet available kind of solve
2747840	2752160	some of the problems with the system and then probably will be added later on by
2752160	2756280	Nintendo type thing kind of like what Sony did with like the music radio
2756280	2760640	players and stuff like that on their system they went ahead and kind of saw
2760640	2765120	what the homebrew community is doing and followed it up with their own they
2765120	2771000	really do need to add mass storage to the Wii that's hurt seriously I should
2771000	2773400	have had more forethought on that but I guess they were trying to keep the price
2773400	2779320	down so bad but seriously seriously how much does like 512 I would think one
2779320	2783800	patch and they could fix that I mean if homebrew can do it why can't the Wii
2783800	2789720	roll out a patch to support it I think because they're just stupid well also
2789720	2793600	good reason well also because the way they've got it formatted in like blocks
2793600	2798800	I don't I mean I guess they could still do that but it's you know I don't know
2798800	2803080	it's just it's no easily you know what I actually just was kind of screwing
2803080	2807040	around one night and like I have a little mini SD card in my cell phone and
2807040	2810640	I actually copied a Wii file like I copied the Mario Brothers channel just
2810640	2814120	for giggles I copied it's in my card and it worked like I didn't have to format
2814120	2817240	my card for blocks it's mixed in there with pictures I take them on my cell
2817240	2819940	phone and everything else so it's like I have Mario Brothers in my pocket
2819940	2823360	everywhere I go but you know it's just kind of messing around seeing if it
2823360	2825840	will work and it did you didn't have to like format the card specifically for
2825840	2830480	blocks I don't know it's just it's really lazy that's what it is hmm well
2830480	2833120	we'll see who knows maybe we'll get a patch in the future especially they want
2833120	2836760	people to keep buying the WiiWare games they want us to redownload it every time
2836760	2840080	do the weed out we downloads things really slow sometimes I don't know if
2840080	2844080	it's just me but sometimes that channel is god-awfully slow and downloading
2844080	2849760	things especially if you haven't used the Wii in a while I don't know some
2849760	2852560	other games that are coming out soon for the Wii they're gonna have some pretty
2852560	2858360	interesting connectivity Ghostbusters you know it's coming out soon here's the
2858360	2862040	thing is that a red fly the development team behind the Wii version of the game
2862040	2865440	they're also doing the PlayStation 2 version just you know in the Wii version
2865440	2871320	you're actually going to be able to use the DS wirelessly no you can't well this
2871320	2876800	this is what's being reported well yes he came out reported here really it yeah
2876800	2880240	unfortunately that was something that was rumored to be happening you know
2880240	2883480	came out and said no that's not gonna happen who said that they actually came
2883480	2887400	out and said no this was a rumor they did oh I would've been so awesome it
2887400	2891400	would be an awesome idea and that's why exactly it wouldn't work because it
2891400	2895800	would be something smart and unfortunately they can't do something
2895800	2901280	smart because that would be wrong well I guess this is all you get then for cool
2901280	2904520	news about the Ghostbusters game and it's kind of borderline cool I guess
2904520	2910000	Bill Murray's coming back as old as he is to do the Ghostbusters lines he's
2910000	2912760	actually going to be in the game he's recording lines for the game so Bill
2912760	2916200	Murray will be in it I don't know I'm kind of I'm kind of given take on Bill
2916200	2922120	Murray he's okay but I love Rushmore like if you've seen that movie from
2922120	2927120	years ago he was great in that movie but lost in translation put me to sleep so
2927120	2932320	I'm indifferent I'm Bill Murray there you have it yeah it's in fact here's the
2932320	2939080	story here according to it's not actually the company he said the red
2939080	2942600	factor whatever it is it's a company called terminal reality is the one
2942600	2945600	behind it he says I'm sorry to report unfortunately this is not a feature of
2945600	2950080	the Wii and DS version of the game it would have been really cool though and
2950080	2955800	that's from terminal reality boss I agree it would be really cool fix it
2955800	2962040	delay the game make it soon it's I mean did you say make it so no I didn't yes
2962040	2965800	you did there was a member there is also that story a long time ago that they
2965800	2971320	were gonna do head tracking with you know boom blocks but from what I hear
2971320	2974920	and what I kind of gathered the reason they didn't do that is because Nintendo
2974920	2980200	stopped it because they don't want people there is a story they don't want
2980200	2983520	people moving a lot in their games cuz they're worried I guess that they're
2983520	2987840	gonna get injured or something but it's almost like they they can't won't allow
2987840	2991920	developers to do something innovative unless it's Nintendo's idea type thing
2991920	2996480	you know to me then we'll we'll roll out the enhancements to your gameplay and
2996480	3007800	then you just follow suit fucking lame interesting but this kind of goes back
3007800	3014960	to a story that we talked about a couple weeks ago actually that whole pole
3014960	3021160	dancing Wii game it's really being worked on it seriously is a peekaboo
3021160	3026680	pole dancing now if anything I thought was a joke it was this so this is kind
3026680	3034440	of shocking to me this is the basically a rep for peekaboo and the licensing
3034440	3039840	agency at 18 new media Simon K this is where they have to say peekaboo will be

3110800	3114560	is never going to work I mean how the hell are they going to really this is
3114560	3118480	really happening there really really is going to be really going to do this
3118480	3123080	really really is not a joke I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't said uh no
3123080	3128160	because I mean they ever happened to the seal of quality this right here it will
3128160	3132240	yeah seriously what did happen to the seal of quality no this right here though
3132240	3137600	is going to be so bad I mean granted it's not obviously it's not going to be
3137600	3142360	a sexual game whatsoever but the fact that you put you know oh it's a game
3142360	3146000	with us it's teaching you to be a stripper you know that's the spin that
3146000	3152480	they're going to put on this shit I don't know it's just there was nothing
3152480	3157640	said about stripping it's aerobic pole dancing there was nothing said about
3157640	3161600	stripping yeah I participate in aerobic pole dancing and her I should say my
3161600	3168320	wife participates in aerobic pole wow nice that's hot okay so is it just
3168320	3173440	because they're trying to focus on aerobic games or games that get you
3173440	3179340	moving it is a bad idea it really is a bad idea it's stupid like honestly how
3179340	3184440	the hell are they gonna do this first off people are gonna you know from what
3184440	3188400	I gather this stuff is pretty hard I mean it's not like something you can
3188400	3191040	just go we're just gonna swing around on a pole and stuff you know you got to be
3191040	3194480	pretty you know in shape to do this kind of crap people are gonna be falling on
3194480	3197720	their fucking heads I mean it's not like the Wii balance board where you just
3197720	3202280	stand there kind of lean to the side this is like fucking crazy shit I mean I
3202280	3205920	don't know is it actually gonna come with a pole I think it's gonna come with
3205920	3211280	a pole because this company they make like a stripper pole that you can buy
3211280	3218600	they had they sell them at like fucking Spencer's nice so why do you think I
3218600	3226200	understand how this would work because even okay just a bad idea aside how the
3226200	3229100	hell are they gonna implement this cuz that's what I was gonna ask like you
3229100	3232720	what are you gonna have like you know like buttons on this thing or something
3232720	3237600	is it gonna sense your movement it I don't it doesn't seem like it would work
3237600	3240200	they're like throwing a concept out there and like okay couple someone make
3240200	3244640	this please because we can't think of a way to do it I just don't see them this
3244640	3249400	is not gonna be it working I don't know people will buy it because it's weird I
3249400	3253840	know that but which will come first Final Fantasy 13 or peekaboo pole
3253840	3264160	dancing pull dancing so do you think they chose the Wii console because of
3264160	3268200	the fact that it has like a sensor bar and they might incorporate because it's
3268200	3273320	your fitness driven words you know and honestly the Wii has gotten into a lot
3273320	3279720	of you know family homes where there's what the women are playing the Wii you
3279720	3287480	mean like housewives moms like strippers yeah strippers yeah well I don't think
3287480	3291080	strippers need to play this stripping game though or the I mean the excuse me
3291080	3296160	aerobic pole dancing yeah I think they do that every night home and take their
3296160	3299640	work home with them or anything so I don't think they're part of the
3299640	3306640	demographic but you know like you know wives who want to try to feel special
3306640	3310120	for their husband and want to be sexy for their house oh sweetie sit down I'm
3310120	3314320	gonna do something special for you and they like turn on the Wii it's like
3314320	3317840	you're kidding dude most guys would be happy that their wives are playing video
3317840	3321680	games in the first place but a pole dancing video game that's like I do see
3321680	3327160	the positives in that yeah I guess like all you have to add to that is her
3327160	3330040	bringing you a beer and cooking your ribs for dinner and you're set oh that's
3330040	3337560	it yeah that's it perfect yeah I don't know it's just maybe April Fool's joke

3462000	3476040	PlayStation 3 and see here I think that's pretty much it oh I thought this was
3476040	3483320	still coming out but I think you may have moved again was it a blast works
3483320	3497920	supposed to come out on the Wii I thought but I think it moved I don't know last works I'm really looking forward to hope that doesn't suck I would do Japanese
3497920	3502000	release dates about this time but there is seriously nothing coming out in Japan
3502000	3505360	this week at least on the calendar I have the next wave of games is not till
3505360	3509040	the 15th which will be next week you have luminous arc 2 on the DS to look
3509040	3513240	forward to next week on the 15th but that as far as this week goes you're
3513240	3516920	gonna have to play the games you already have nothing new coming out in Japan
3516920	3530160	sorry Japan where we're all no one gets excited and so we kind of teased this
3530160	3535880	earlier when we decided not to go to e3 because of the ESA membership not
3535880	3538640	because we weren't invited or anything just because you know we said I was on
3538640	3542400	Bobby show where that happened by the way not this show whatever Bobby
3542400	3547280	Blackwell five o'clock on all games whatever we're not going now but anyways
3547280	3555720	Activision and video have discontinued their ESA membership and you know also
3555720	3562600	kind of going along with that they are not going to be at e3 so according to
3562600	3568640	ESA is rich Taylor's senior vice president communications and research he
3568640	3573280	says we can confirm the Activision of it then bindi games I thought it was
3573280	3577600	Activision Blizzard but you know I could be wrong opted to discontinue their
3577600	3581720	membership the ESA remains dedicated to advancing our industry's objective as
3581720	3585800	protecting intellectual property preserving First Amendment rights and
3585800	3590880	fostering the benefits our beneficial environmental environment for the entire
3590880	3594560	industry I guess you don't really have any offensive games or anything so they
3594560	3598840	don't really need them to defend their rights for anything or you know at the
3598840	3602200	same time I guess they don't really have to participate in their you know
3602200	3606960	defending the rights of gamers and gaming industry because they're doing it
3606960	3609800	for other people it's still kind of loops them in there it's kind of like
3609800	3616360	going along for a free ride type thing says uh let's see while the
3616360	3620400	Entertainment Software Association remains the permanent voice for the US
3620400	3625200	computer and video game publishers we can confirm that Activision and video
3625200	3633480	games opted to discontinue the membership and blah blah blah it's
3633480	3638320	interesting so why'd they do it that's the question of the week it doesn't say
3638320	3641760	I think they're just being cheap you think well think about it I mean if
3641760	3646080	you're you know a group of companies or whatever and you're paying the ESA to
3646080	3651560	say defend you from these you know laws out there that are you know trying to
3651560	3656200	prevent like say M rated games being sold to anybody or you know calling
3656200	3660440	games porn stuff like that if you say drop out of this you know organization
3660440	3664000	this organization is still working for other companies to do that defend them
3664000	3669800	against other things instead now they have less money to work with that's
3669800	3673240	really the only downside but they're still fighting for you it's just you're
3673240	3677200	not paying them you're kind of just sitting there you know it's like your
3677200	3680880	friends all chipping for pizzas like oh that's cool I'm not really hungry right
3680880	3684600	now and later on you know oh there's some pizza left over so you start you
3684600	3688400	know scoffing down a piece well you're just a freeloader yeah it still affects
3688400	3692160	them regardless of whether they're a member of the USA or not so they why
3692160	3697840	would they just pay to do that you know and also do they really make any games
3697840	3703000	that would be affected by any kind of law publicity Activision probably not
3703000	3708100	because I think they mainly just you know Call Duty 4 is probably the
3708100	3714600	riskiest thing that they have but that's not even really that bad probably not I
3714600	3719360	don't think you know there are a lot of movie licenses and yeah Tony Hawk and
3719360	3723280	yeah that's actually pretty smart on their part there you know they're gonna
3723280	3726920	be saving a but it's not cheap it's just you know I don't know I think act
3726920	3730300	deft and chat makes the comment a lot of people I've kind of seen have been
3730300	3738000	making this week screw e3 packs is where it's at yeah well e3 is kind of its
3738000	3742780	beginning its decline yes yeah like there's nothing special about e3 anymore
3742780	3746320	nobody cares about it I think the appeal you think these company actually missed
3746320	3752740	the old e3 it's possible yeah I don't know because a lot of the comments I've
3752740	3758200	seen or theories on it is they got tired of e3 being kind of a pissing contest of
3758200	3765100	who who's flashier who's you know doing bigger things and stuff like that and so
3765100	3770160	now they weren't getting business done and they're just you know it's a kind of
3770160	3774400	a waste of time for them whereas I don't know like something like packs they have
3774400	3777160	people that are interested in their product they can you know it's their
3777160	3780440	target audience I guess and they're still getting the press releases out
3780440	3783200	there and also now that they've figured out that they can do these gamer days
3783200	3786840	and no press events like that was my thought exactly it the whole press comes
3786840	3791200	out for gamers day at the all these gamers day stuff why why bother anything
3791200	3795080	well you know what I mean bastards of the elite press that we didn't get
3795080	3798800	invited to e3 either so you know whatever but they they get into these
3798800	3804520	things so why bother with e3 and exactly and it doesn't really matter the press
3804520	3807040	gets to see this stuff anyways cuz a lot of times they're just saying them
3807040	3813000	pre-release copies of these games anyways it really unfortunately press
3813000	3816840	isn't working the way it used to before where you know people are actually
3816840	3820600	reporting on things now they're working closely with these game companies and
3820600	3823920	the game companies are telling them how to report stuff and they're you know
3823920	3827280	going back and forth and making deals and that kind of thing it's really all
3827280	3831760	they're kind of like the press is in their pocket type thing nowadays but
3831760	3835960	does everybody wants to break exclusives yes everyone everyone wants their
3835960	3840760	exclusives and and fortunately we as we found out the hard way you know that
3840760	3844720	goes to the people that can make the you know deals say hey I'll tell you what
3844720	3848680	we'll give you a premium advertising for your game on our website if we can break
3848680	3853720	this exclusive on the story and and they will just literally you know tell you
3853720	3858280	one thing oh yeah everyone's gonna get the story at the same time and just boof
3858280	3864040	it gets you know out there and they're like oh well sorry I thought everyone's
3864040	3870280	on the same page about this kind of stuff really right it's it's just you
3870280	3876240	know they follow the money well they are business people so I would love to see
3876240	3879680	an underground blog come out that just outs all these things you know what I
3879680	3888280	mean before the company's buy-in if it's possible it might be I don't know I
3888280	3894640	don't know got the comments from chats shadow Charlie simply says fuck e3 we do
3894640	3899280	says e3 was a sensation that grew too out of control I don't know I would
3899280	3902360	think maybe some people kind of miss the glam that comes with e3 because boy that
3902360	3906840	show got a lot of press coverage a lot a lot of press coverage and now the tone
3906840	3911080	down one not quite as much you know maybe amongst the hardcore gamers sure
3911080	3919960	but amongst the general public not so much I don't know and I and they're like
3919960	3923680	saying I know their excuses that we've heard before we're just like oh it's
3923680	3928880	hard you know for us to make demos and stuff for for these events and it really
3928880	3934720	interferes with our production schedules and stuff like that I haven't really
3934720	3937920	noticed an issue over the last like 10 years or whatever that you know these
3937920	3943920	have been you know probably even longer that these have been going on so I think
3943920	3946680	that's just an excuse I think they're just looking the ways to save money
3946680	3949680	because nowadays I don't know if they're not making as much money or maybe the
3949680	3954480	margins are smaller but cutting costs any way they can and a glamorous event
3954480	3958200	like e3 that's definitely inexpensive they can probably do without well guess
3958200	3962720	what Activision Vivendi are not the only ones who have decided to skip e3 this
3962720	3967680	year that's what makes the story even more interesting and see soft foundation
3967680	3973280	9 and Atlas have all also opted out of this year's e3 this has been confirmed
3973280	3980240	by other attendees as well kind of interesting foundation 9 game spotters
3980240	3984040	reported foundation 9 is out because quote we just didn't feel like we got
3984040	3987520	enough out of the investment last year in order to justify the expense this
3987520	3991200	year that is telling me that sounds like a quote where somebody sounds like they
3991200	3995880	miss is the old e3 not getting enough exposure whereas the old e3 was all
3995880	3999560	about you know yes it was a little bit sensationalistic but think about all of
3999560	4004560	that exposure yes you had people at e3 that may may or may not have been there
4004560	4008000	but they get the word out and they're they're loving all the stuff they see
4008000	4012920	because it's e3 everybody's pumped every game you play is awesome what they've
4012920	4016640	changed from you know years past they've gotten rid of like the Kenshia Hall
4016640	4020280	where you had all the independent game companies and stuff down there were
4020280	4024040	people you know after they visit all the other booths and stuff they just go down
4024040	4027120	there and check out a lot of these games that don't normally get press you'll see
4027120	4029760	a lot of stuff down there that's pretty amazing that will eventually get picked
4029760	4034500	up by a company and stuff and if they would get a lot of foot traffic a lot
4034500	4038060	more than they would get you know if they just had a booth at this new e3 you
4038060	4042520	know because from what I heard there was you know obviously before there was a
4042520	4046200	lot of traveling in between hotels and stuff like that a lot of more of a
4046200	4051320	strict schedule so it's a lot less time to kind of explore it at your own pace and
4051320	4055440	that probably also the decreased foot traffic kind of hurt them a little bit
4055440	4058200	because when you have a lot of stories to cover and stuff a lot of the
4058200	4062320	independent media doesn't get to cover these you know smaller companies and
4062320	4063720	that kind of sucks.
4063720	4069520	Alright well also some other speculation going on around the internet about
4069520	4073680	exactly why this is all going down this week which is probably the biggest thing
4073680	4078400	to happen this week. Kotaku managed to get the organizer of the Penny Arcade
4078400	4084320	Expo to comment on this. This is from Robert Koo who's the director of
4084320	4088000	business development for the Penny Arcade Expo quote, the reason that E3 imploded
4088000	4091080	in recent years was because the publishers felt that it turned into this
4091080	4094720	sort of pissing contest between them where they were trying to figure out who
4094720	4095960	could one-up each other.
4095960	4101640	They all thought to themselves that it just wasn't worth it. I would imagine
4101640	4104240	that the show is still trying to look out for what the publishers want. That's
4104240	4107440	the whole goal of the trade association which is to deliver the needs and try to
4107440	4113240	figure out what their members actually want. So there you have it. More
4113240	4116840	speculation as to why E3 may be shrinking. It's going to be very
4116840	4120680	interesting to see what happens in kind of the coming weeks as more you know
4120680	4123840	kind of gets out. I'm curious if this is going to be the start of a mass
4123840	4128760	exodus or what's going to happen. You may see that because member E4all, same
4128760	4133280	kind of thing happened there with big companies saying oh we're not
4133280	4136360	going to be a part of this. Microsoft and Sony both pulled out of that didn't they? I think so
4136360	4141400	yeah. You think these companies might go to E4all instead? No. I don't think
4141400	4144360	they will. I think they'll do their own because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo
4144360	4147960	don't really need these kind of events anyways because they have their own big
4147960	4153360	events. In fact one we'll be talking about in some last minute stories, the
4153360	4157240	PlayStation day. They invite the press out for that kind of stuff and I
4157240	4162520	know Microsoft has their own conference and same with Nintendo so there's really
4162520	4168600	no reason that they need to be a part of E3. I mean especially if it's going to
4168600	4171440	cost them a lot more money. I'm sure they would like the press for it and stuff
4171440	4176840	but I don't know. I still miss the I would hate it if they didn't you know
4176840	4180360	show up because I miss their press conferences. That's my favorite part you
4180360	4184720	know hearing all their cool new things. Although Nintendo last year is kind of
4184720	4191520	disappointing with those we zapper and we wheel dumb ideas but whatever. Anywho
4191520	4197760	back on a different subject here. Prince of Persia. Well we talked a little bit a
4197760	4201280	few weeks ago that there was gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming
4201280	4211040	out. The brand new game is I guess gonna be just called Prince of Persia and not
4211040	4215040	some sort of Prince of Persia prodigy or whatever but it's scheduled to be
4215040	4222360	released on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It will be a prequel to the previous Prince
4222360	4227800	of Persia series and I believe is gonna be a trilogy as well so it's supposed to
4227800	4235400	introduce I guess an illustrative art style and I guess the DS is also getting
4235400	4239480	their own Prince of Persia game but it's gonna be exclusive to that console and
4239480	4247360	will be its own unique storyline. So pretty cool hmm and they actually I
4247360	4259160	found I think I found some scans there was a magazine was it it was a joy pad
4259160	4264960	it's a magazine that had some pictures and it looks pretty cool actually it's
4264960	4272560	like almost not really cel-shaded but sort of I don't know how I would really
4272560	4277200	describe that. What do you think about this Rob here real quick and I'll link the
4277200	4284520	chat room to these scans as well. It's you know I'm not surprised that Prince of
4284520	4287160	Persia continuing especially you know they have this movie coming out I'm a
4287160	4290360	little bit surprised they're kind of relaunching it as a you know kind of
4290360	4292760	spin-off series or what have you but you know if they're gonna do that that's
4292760	4295720	probably why they're trying to change the look of it and everything so why not
4295720	4299280	Prince of Persia has always been a solid game I think the best way to describe it
4299280	4302880	Prince of Persia series is very solid line of games so you know what the heck
4302880	4307720	but that's an interesting art style I think oh yeah looks like like Okami ish
4307720	4311560	I don't know yeah I guess it would be like a cross between Okami and say like
4311560	4317660	I don't know just like a normal like action game it's like I don't know it's
4317660	4322120	really hard to describe it it's a 3d game with like inclines on the outside I
4322120	4327840	guess anyways I'll link it in the chat room it's on a website action trip calm
4327840	4334720	so all right well in other news clock tower you remember this game long time
4334720	4338120	ago it was out on the PlayStation can you describe what happened in clock
4338120	4342920	tower you were a girl I don't remember the specifics of it I guess she got like
4342920	4346800	locked into a towers or I know it was like a house or something a mansion and
4346800	4353680	basically the objective was for you to hide from this like crazy huge scissor
4353680	4360280	welding guy and he would like you would be walking around like the rooms inside
4360280	4364040	of the mansion or whatever and he would hear like music or your heartbeat I
4364040	4367440	don't remember exactly I played it a long time ago but you would know somehow
4367440	4370840	that he was coming so you had to like hide from him and then he would come
4370840	4373840	through and like it would be really tense because you don't know if he'd
4373840	4377440	find you or not because he kind of like he'd walk by he'd sometimes he'd like
4377440	4381040	look behind stuff or whatever and so that was kind of the big thing about it
4381040	4386200	I saw this game like one time this game was a trip from oh my god scary it's
4386200	4390080	almost scarier than like Silent Hill and some of those yeah no it's like it's
4390080	4394880	tense it was brutal too if he found you snap your head got cut off yeah that's
4394880	4398720	part of the whole tension of it is like oh crap he's gonna find me you know like
4398720	4402080	yeah but it was good it was good well they're making a movie out of it I
4402080	4405640	can't wait that's gonna be freaky variety is reported this and there's
4405640	4409600	been rumors of a clock tower movie for quite a long time what variety is
4409600	4413760	reported this week that senator entertainment is going to be producing
4413760	4418120	it Weinstein company is putting it out you know that's they used home your max
4418120	4422540	and all that stuff the guy who wrote borderland Eric poppin is writing the
4422540	4428080	script the folks who produced the hills have eyes to producing this I don't know
4428080	4432960	so much about that Marco Weber and Martin wise so it should be it sounds
4432960	4436360	like it'll be at least if nothing else what a good horror film you know like
4436360	4443320	the kind of like a cheap cheesy film you know I want it to have some substance in
4443320	4448720	it you know like I yeah even though it is a video game movie like I don't I
4448720	4455280	want them to actually do something with it all right we'll see what happens well
4455280	4460160	you know because this week was so big with a grand theft auto 4 people were
4460160	4464080	wondering well where is the PC version of the game and like you may remember
4464080	4469160	with the other ones it was a while after you know they came out that the PC
4469160	4477040	version finally made its way to the market of course rockstar is doing the
4477040	4483560	old no comment thing on the Grand Theft Auto for PC version but more than
4483560	4488240	likely it probably around at some point people are hoping that maybe by this
4488240	4491880	holiday will see it on the PC I don't see why they wouldn't mean that's more
4491880	4496480	sales for them and especially I imagine the PC version probably look a little
4496480	4502780	bit better to especially on some high-end pcs but there are some
4502780	4508120	publishers though they're still listing the game as being released on October
4508120	4516360	30th 2008 of course you know take two or rockstar has not announced the release
4516360	4521760	of that game or even the existence of the game so I don't know if it's any
4521760	4527960	consolation though the last three PC releases for Grand Theft Auto 3 Vice
4527960	4533340	City and San Andreas were all pretty quiet too so maybe there's a
4533340	4538360	possibility although I don't know if three was on the PC wasn't it oh yeah
4538360	4543360	Vice City was Vice City and actually I think three may have been on the PC I
4543360	4548800	don't remember but I know Vice City and San Andreas were all right well guess
4548800	4555480	what I've got for you guys here before we get to the end of part a yes it's
4555480	4562360	another stupid award for the week sadly this week it's it's not so gruesome I
4562360	4566240	guess it's actually good things we don't actually like people dying but this is
4566240	4573160	very stupid nonetheless happened in San Diego 27 year old robbed a GameStop he
4573160	4578220	actually pepper sprayed two employees and stole launch day copies of Grand
4578220	4586120	Theft Auto 4 however as the person who actually robbed the store Richard feel
4586120	4589940	is his name they actually have a little picture of him on the internet in the
4589940	4594360	back of the police car he found that real life is a little bit harder than
4594360	4598720	Grand Theft Auto because police actually found a copy of Grand Theft Auto they
4598720	4602520	they got him and they found a copy of Grand Theft Auto 3 and a PlayStation 3
4602520	4606440	controller in his pickup truck along with the stolen copy of Grand Theft Auto
4606440	4610880	4 here's the police department commented to the local NBC affiliate in San Diego
4610880	4615360	the call came out as a robbery of a commercial business and the suspect was
4615360	4618320	described in the vehicle truck that he got into was described as a white
4618320	4622040	Toyota pickup truck lifted with the tailgate down and our helicopter Abel
4622040	4630680	spotted the vehicle southbound the officers followed it so that was it no
4630680	4641440	word on how many stars he accumulated a comment from chat alpha canagram says I
4641440	4645920	bet Lord Voldemort paid that dude to do it of course load Lord Voldemort is our
4645920	4656880	other name for you know who probably paid him to do it anyhow if you're gonna
4656880	4660320	steal a game we just shouldn't steal a game stealing games is stupid it's been
4660320	4662920	he stole one game
4662920	4671720	it's just funny no you shouldn't steal at all it's it's very bad when you steal
4671720	4681560	hey we're gonna get somebody on the line here to do something special for you at the very very end of part a of our podcast because you know what happens at the end of part a of our show all the
4681560	4693000	time do two ringy dingys hi Jamie hey it's Rob orange lounge the show misses
4693000	4699880	you tonight how you doing you're dead I'm sorry to hear that did the guy from
4699880	4706000	clock tower kill you know no no I moved a lot of furniture yesterday and then
4706000	4711280	ran errands all day and then drove back gotcha well hey you know you know it's a
4711280	4714920	time it's we're at the end of part a finally we surprisingly rate ran long
4714920	4718640	tonight with not much gaming news and you know it's there's always a segment
4718640	4723000	that we do this part of the show so we had to bring you here to give us your
4723000	4726000	classic game of the week
4726000	4730960	your part of the show where we pay respect to our elders in gaming with
4730960	4734600	Jamie picking out a game from the long lost archives of games that folks should
4734600	4738920	really check out this week so Jamie what did you pick for the kids tonight I
4738920	4744800	picked out nothing that was obscure or crazy or weird or anything I picked out super mario brothers 3
4744800	4754520	why not a true classic one of my favorite games when it came out I went
4754520	4757960	completely crazy it was the only reason that I would see the other wizard to
4757960	4766160	begin with the game you know it was you know what super mario brothers 2 was
4766160	4769640	over here wasn't really super mario brothers 2 super mario brothers 2 was
4769640	4773960	more like the original was more like a rehash of the first game whereas 3
4773960	4780160	actually did some real innovations by having your different worlds different
4780160	4793280	things like that the whole point of it is the whole point was that formula that
4793280	4798960	everyone had become accustomed to and then blew it up really big so it was really cool
4798960	4809640	you had different worlds you had world 1 was grassland, world 2 was desert, 3 was seaside, 4 was big island, 5 was the sky
4809640	4817720	6 was iceland, 7 was pitanese, and 8 was castle kubak
4817720	4825360	each world had you know different maps that would go along with the theme of
4825360	4830520	whatever that world was but you also had different little mini fortresses that
4830520	4834760	you had to go through and then you had your primary thoughts with different ways of
4834760	4839960	beating them although a lot of them were just like a certain type of a different
4839960	4845360	pattern would fit like different ones those three I remember the bosses the
4845360	4848480	bosses were all pretty easy if you just keep stomping on their heads repeatedly
4848480	4853480	and don't let him get don't let him get any moves on you well now remember you
4853480	4856960	have the ones that were on the rocking platform oh that's true and then you
4856960	4860880	have and then you have the ones that were in the room that would shrink I
4860880	4866480	guess as long as you kept up your pattern it was easy
4866480	4875120	oh we have some boss model music in here well for the fortress music and this
4875120	4878720	you know what made this game super famous here's what I remember about
4878720	4882360	Super Mario Bros 3 this will always be my not only I believe is this the best
4882360	4887000	selling video game ever which makes it a true classic but this was the game that
4887000	4891360	was not originally packaged with the system oh that okay the way oh yeah
4891360	4894480	because obviously you know you have Super Mario Brothers is the pack and of
4894480	4898840	course that's gonna sell more technicality I remember this game for
4898840	4908920	being featured in the movie the wizard I think that was the motivation for a lot
4908920	4916080	of us was to see like the first sneak peek at Super Mario Bros 3 remember the
4916080	4920160	guy introducing it in the movie he made it sound all like holy it's great and
4920160	4925640	now we're like yeah but the other thing that I thought was really cool about
4925640	4930880	that he was a different power-ups that you would get you had your usual
4930880	4937720	mushroom you had your fire flower but you also had the raccoon tail that you
4937720	4941960	could get that was always like my favorite to have ever you had your you
4941960	4948320	know your power stars we had you know all your other mushrooms the Tennessee
4948320	4953320	suit was fantastic because you could also turn into the monk statue and the
4953320	4956400	enemy who just ignore you for a little bit except you really didn't do that on
4956400	4959800	the donut level you don't anybody donut level where you'd run over the little
4959800	4964400	donuts and they would fall you can get on that level could you die but the
4964400	4966440	other cool thing about the Trinity students if you turn into the statue
4966440	4969320	while you're airborne you'll land on something and it'll kill it and it's
4969320	4975680	great you also get the peeling which was there's actually two items as a peeling
4975680	4981840	or an anchor and you get this out of some of the toad houses and it's like if
4981840	4987520	you collect a certain number of coins on even number world you would get the
4987520	4994240	anchor if you did it on the odd world and you would get a peeling or maybe
4994240	5000080	through the way around anyway so yeah it was that way um also on a couple of the
5000080	5005560	places you could get a hammer brother suit you could go hammers and there was
5005560	5014000	one fire brother that would um but you uh I'm being scared out by my husband
5014000	5018760	then says the anchor was worthless however to shoot rock the anchor was
5018760	5021400	worthless you know what I will tell you though you want piss me off about
5021400	5029680	power-ups Jamie okay go ahead that's why I was gonna say no no not just the fact
5029680	5032680	that it was there but what pissed me off you can only use that damn shoe in one
5032680	5045600	level I know you know what they should go ahead they should make a game for the
5045600	5051560	Wii called kuriboh shoe everybody would buy it that would be great well there
5051560	5056240	were some different levels between the American and Japanese version some were
5056240	5063640	changed for matters of just copy did it cause the game to glitch like in world
5063640	5067960	five there was in five one if you would have to go to a pipe to get to where the
5067960	5073640	screen goes black and white and it would actually cause the game to glitch up
5073640	5077720	pretty bad um also if you got hit in the Japanese version no matter what power
5077720	5083320	if you had you would go back to being small if whereas in the American one you
5083320	5088080	would just go to being super and then to be small except with the kuriboh shoe
5088080	5092960	which was you'd go back to being small in Japanese version but in American one
5092960	5096840	you just go back to whatever power-up you had then to super and then to small
5096840	5105800	and the music of the game was done by Koji Kondo who I got to meet and he's a
5105800	5113720	guy yeah and there were remakes there was the Satellaview version for Super
5113720	5119880	Famicom which is basically the enhanced version that looked like Super Mario All
5119880	5125440	Stars which again was another version and actually Super Mario All Stars had
5125440	5129000	the version that came out actually retained some of the stuff that was in
5129000	5132920	the Japanese version and not in the u.s. one we also got Super Mario Advance 4
5132920	5139640	Super Mario 3 which was pretty cool and had stuff added and you know I did spice
5139640	5144600	it up a little bit and that one was developed by Nintendo R&B 2 pretty cool
5144600	5149000	there were e-reader extra levels that would extend the game but they were
5149000	5153240	really convoluted and hard to do so it was like people just said I screw it and
5153240	5158960	didn't bother I don't even remember that they had Super Mario Brothers 3d the
5158960	5164960	Walmart cards and some that came with the game with might with Super Mario
5164960	5171360	Advance 4 that the extensions were for the advanced version but you had to have
5171360	5177360	the e-reader 2 GBAs a link cable and the card you wanted and you would hook up
5177360	5185400	the GBA with the cartridge and the connector will go in the e-reader and
5185400	5188680	then you would do all this convoluted crap and it was a big pain in the ass
5188680	5194120	and not I mean the levels were cool and it really opened up I think a lot of
5194120	5198720	potential to have you know almost infinite playability as long as people
5198720	5203240	are willing to put up with the crap you had to do to use the e-reader but other
5203240	5208760	than that you know of course the whole e-reader thing sort of died out once
5208760	5214000	they started upgrading the hardware very interesting very interesting comment
5214000	5219080	from Rama in chat Nintendo give us Super Mario Brothers 4 you know we never
5219080	5222920	really have had just a plain Super Mario Brothers games since Super Mario
5222920	5226000	Brothers 3 I mean sure there's been Mario World there's been countless other
5226000	5228960	games have had Mario in it but there's never ever been a Super Mario Brothers
5228960	5249920	4 I guess so but it was also you know down to the world down to powerups down
5249920	5255440	to all the specials and actually if I do remember right I think that you the
5255440	5261560	Super Mario World feather was actually the power-up and you could use that as
5261560	5267240	a power-up in Mario and Mario for advanced but I really think the world
5267240	5270400	could be considered I think it's just as they decided to stop numbering them
5270400	5273160	because it would get ridiculous and then fall into you know street fighter
5273160	5276840	formula true and hit stem points out that you also have the one on the DS that
5276840	5280560	really really if anything was like the closest thing we've had to Mario 3 in a
5280560	5286320	long time you know I mean that was oh yeah new Super Mario Brothers about
5286320	5291520	Mario advanced so yeah one four but yeah we didn't have that I guess and mean the
5291520	5297440	Mario and we had a lost levels not lost levels but the all-stars all right well
5297440	5303200	any other thoughts on the Super Mario Brothers 3 it was fun and I'm gonna
5303200	5308560	break out my my top loading Nintendo soon and play the hell out of it when I
5308560	5312520	don't feel like I'm gonna fall over and I just don't use whistles because you
5312520	5318160	know that's cheating no it's not cheating we are going to have a
5318160	5322560	discussion right here right now about using the work with those it's not
5322560	5328560	cheating it for a reason I know it's okay into the game it's not cheating but
5328560	5335280	you've got to admit so much more fun to play without warping you you don't get
5335280	5341280	to play big world if you war big world is the bomb I agree with that but you
5341280	5345040	can work to get ahead to get right to big you know you can go right there
5345040	5353560	that's only half cheating okay okay it was programmed into the game for a
5353560	5357360	reason and you know what you know what I had the same argument with people who
5357360	5362320	say oh you can't use speed ups on DDR either of like okay go back and play
5362320	5368200	beat mania without you know speed up it wasn't in the original all right fine
5368200	5373360	warp all you want but I want big world and the level with curry boshu they'll
5373360	5378320	program more all right all right Jamie we got to wrap up part a so we get to
5378320	5381880	part B or we'll be here all night all right any other quick things you wanted
5381880	5387360	to say to share with the listeners before you're back here next week I
5387360	5394040	really like fishy all right enjoy your sushi for lunch all right burp all right
