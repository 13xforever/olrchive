Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.700 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.500 --> 00:27.900
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.

00:27.900 --> 00:33.500
But you're probably thinking to yourself, but hey, Rob, it's about 7.30 in the evening Pacific or 10.30 Eastern.

00:33.500 --> 00:43.000
That's because it's time for part B of our podcast, which goes out to the podcast feed usually on Wednesdays, Thursdays if I'm having an especially busy week like last week.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
So sorry about that.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.400
Also this week, a bonus podcast, just a very, very short 10 minute little podcast will go out to the feed probably midweek,

00:50.400 --> 00:57.500
probably before you hear this part B podcast listeners that actually will have the Grand Theft Auto finalists in it.

00:57.500 --> 01:10.900
You know, we had that contest going on that ultimately rolls up into the All Games competition where we are actually going to be giving away a Grand Theft Auto for limited edition one and eight custom console Xbox 360 Elite.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.900
It's going to be awesome.

01:11.900 --> 01:15.700
And I played for you guys entry from an ineligible listener in part A.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.900
So if you haven't heard part A yet, go back and listen.

01:17.900 --> 01:22.400
For those of you listening live tonight on All Games Radio, you have about four hours left to get an entry in.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.200
I'll tell you what, there's not a lot of competition.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.700
So if you think you can come up with something creative pretty quick, do it.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.400
You might win an Xbox 360 Elite.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.200
It's going to be pretty awesome.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.800
We'll let you know who is the finalist for Orange Lounge Radio next week.

01:33.800 --> 01:41.300
And I think we'll know in like two, two and a half weeks who the ultimate winner is from AllGames.com, who's walking away with the one and eight Xbox 360 Elite.

01:41.300 --> 01:45.700
Don't forget, just for being the Orange Lounge Radio finalist, you do get some prizes.

01:45.700 --> 01:53.700
You get like a T-shirt and $25 gift certificate to the new All Games store that's up and running.

01:53.700 --> 01:54.400
That's awesome.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
Awesome.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.500
All right, just for being silly and recording it for our mutual enjoyment.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.300
All right, let's get back into some gaming news here on part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.200
Loki, take it away.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
All right, let's see here.

02:06.200 --> 02:10.900
Well, this is kind of interesting because I know they haven't been doing too well for the longest time.

02:10.900 --> 02:18.000
But Atari is actually being bought up by Infogrames for $11 million.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.700
And the announced, I guess, merger, they're going to buy the remaining stock of Atari, of course, for $11 million.

02:25.700 --> 02:31.200
And that will immediately lend $20 million to the company before the deal closes.

02:31.200 --> 02:43.400
And although it's hard to really say what's going to happen, although Infogrames only had 51.4 controlling interest in Atari, or 51.4%.

02:43.400 --> 02:50.000
It looks like it doesn't really sound like what kind of changes are going to happen after this.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.500
But I guess it's nice for Atari to have a little bit more financial backing.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.000
Well, here's the thing, though.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.300
Essentially, Atari has been sold for $11 million.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.700
Is that what I'm going to understand?

03:01.700 --> 03:02.100
Yeah.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.600
I mean, $11 million is not that much money.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.700
I mean, don't get me wrong.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.000
I'd gladly take $11 million.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.600
Our company that I work for could have bought Atari.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.700
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.300
I'm like, dude, this is the company that is like my childhood.

03:14.300 --> 03:19.400
You know, when I mean like little childhood, like when I was like three, was when the Atari 2600 was big.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.200
But still, it's kind of weird to think that...

03:22.200 --> 03:23.600
Why hasn't EA bought them?

03:23.600 --> 03:27.400
I mean, they could have just like, seriously, it's just why I boof, snapped them up like nothing.

03:27.400 --> 03:36.100
I mean, I know that they may not be interested in per se them, but a bigger portfolio is not a bad thing.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.700
I mean, granted, it sounds like there's some other stuff involved here.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.900
Like the whole, like they're loaning them $20 million and stuff.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.300
So maybe it's not fair to say they're only getting sold for $11 million.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.700
But still, that's kind of what it comes off as.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.200
It's just kind of weird.

03:48.200 --> 03:53.600
It'd be like if someone sold Nintendo 20 years from now for like, I don't know, $15, $20 million.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.600
A bag of peanuts.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.400
I mean, that would be like, it would be weird.

03:58.400 --> 04:04.200
Of course, it was also weird to see the Sega logo on a Nintendo game like years ago when F-Zero came out.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.500
It's all weird.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.900
That is weird.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.500
Sephiroth1215 in our chat room.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.300
Chat.orangelauncherader.com says,

04:10.300 --> 04:13.200
Too bad most Atari or Infogrames games suck.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.500
The Dragon Ball Z games are good, but I'm really sick of them now because they just do the same thing every year.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.800
I mean, I guess that is the sad thing.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.300
Atari honestly hasn't had a lot going for it recently.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.500
See, that would have been perfect.

04:22.500 --> 04:27.700
You could have had Dragon Ball Z 2008 or 2009 for EA.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.400
Although I have to admit, I did kind of want one of those flashback consoles.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.100
I mean, it's not like I can't still get one, but you know, flashback consoles are cool.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.600
So, I guess there you have it.

04:38.600 --> 04:45.800
More to develop on that or more news on that, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, including what the joint projects will be in the future.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.000
Let's talk about Qmotions.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.100
They are a subsidiary of Actiga.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.100
They're a gaming company.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.400
They apparently have made some sort of agreement with Microsoft.

04:55.400 --> 05:03.800
They're going to be using the wireless technology that Qmotions has for types of active gaming controllers for the Xbox 360.

05:03.800 --> 05:10.000
Now, Qmotions has made these large controllers for like golf, baseball, and snowboarding.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.500
I want to say, I've seen this before.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.700
I want to say one of those times...

05:15.700 --> 05:17.600
They sell them at Best Buy, I think.

05:17.600 --> 05:25.200
I want to say one of those times we were on All Games Interactive, like, last year or a couple of years ago.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.700
Like, they had one of these in the house.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.400
Like, they had just acquired one there.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.100
Like, I wonder if...

05:29.100 --> 05:31.000
I think that was the same thing.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.800
So, they know how to make these types of controllers.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.900
Well, apparently, Microsoft is getting in on this now for who knows what type of project.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.800
But it kind of makes sense, you know, with the Wii doing as well as it is.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.500
Microsoft wants a piece of it somehow, so they'll buy somebody else to do it.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.800
Make an agreement to do it.

05:47.800 --> 05:53.100
The press release stated that the first controller that will be coming out will be a big Air wireless controller.

05:53.100 --> 05:57.500
It's a full-size skateboard that will work with skateboarding games.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.000
I mean, this is pretty high-end stuff.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.700
This isn't something that, you know, a gamer that doesn't have a lot of money can pick up.

06:04.700 --> 06:09.200
But still, I mean, if you really want to get immersed in your games, I guess this is the way to do it.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.800
This is what they should be setting up at the Westin.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.700
I mean, this is the kind of thing you don't get to play every day.

06:15.700 --> 06:16.100
There you have it.

06:16.100 --> 06:16.800
What do you think, Loki?

06:16.800 --> 06:19.300
Is this the type of thing you would be interested in at all?

06:19.300 --> 06:20.100
No.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.100
Why not?

06:21.100 --> 06:21.500
I don't know.

06:21.500 --> 06:27.300
It sounds like, as Alton Brown would put it, it's a uni-tasker.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.500
And no one likes a uni-tasker.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.000
Wow.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.100
Nerd.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.800
Only you would quote the Food Network here on our program.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.100
Hey.

06:37.100 --> 06:41.900
So there's a game coming out here pretty soon that I think a lot of people will be interested in.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.900
On a rain-slick precipice of darkness, episode one.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.000
That's right, the Penny Arcade Adventures game.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.500
Episode one has gone gold and is due out on PC later this quarter for $20.

06:53.500 --> 07:04.200
Then I believe later on, also, they will be releasing it to Xbox Live for 1600 Microsoft points, also $20.

07:04.200 --> 07:10.100
It will also make it the most expensive Xbox Live arcade game to date.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.800
Yeah, but if you add up all the parts in Luminous, it's a little more expensive.

07:13.800 --> 07:19.800
That is true, but still though, out of the gate though, this is the most expensive Xbox Live arcade game.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.100
And probably going to set a disturbing trend among games.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.300
Hey, they're going to buy it for 20 bucks.

07:25.300 --> 07:29.700
Let's put out our crappy game for $20.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.700
I don't know, but you kind of sense that Penny Arcade's going to be able to get away with it.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.800
I mean, it's all about if the game is good, but at least the IP is good.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.500
Yeah, I mean, if it's a full game, I mean, that'll be awesome.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.300
But I just have a bad feeling though that other companies are going to look at this and go,

07:42.300 --> 07:47.000
hey, you know what, we can get our game to be $20 too, and they'll sell it and it'll be shit.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.800
Well, if some little internet comic can get $20 for their game,

07:50.800 --> 07:55.000
then we ought to be able to sell our game for $20.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.700
You do that too well, Rob.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.300
I've been snooping in on boardrooms.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.200
So, um...

08:01.200 --> 08:03.500
How about Macintosh?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.100
Who cares? I'm just kidding.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.200
The chat room's asking.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.100
Oh, no love, I guess.

08:10.100 --> 08:15.300
So, do we know anything about the actual game?

08:15.300 --> 08:17.800
There's screenshots and stuff out there. I haven't done a lot of research on the game.

08:17.800 --> 08:22.300
I'm sorry, it is gone gold for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.500
Well, there you have it.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Awesome.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.800
So you can't say you don't have anything to play on the Mac.

08:26.800 --> 08:32.300
I don't know a lot about this game. Isn't it kind of like an adventure-type game?

08:32.300 --> 08:34.000
It's like an adventure game.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.300
Kind of think of like a cross between one of the LucasArts adventure games and Final Fantasy.

08:39.300 --> 08:46.400
So you've got the turn-based fighting in there as well, and it's all the Penny Arcade humor.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.900
I don't know.

08:47.900 --> 08:48.900
Interesting.

08:48.900 --> 08:49.900
It looks really cool.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.900
Alright. Well, Rockband has made some progress, a lot of progress.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.900
This game, of course, just on about every console out there, except the Wii right now.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.900
It's out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, right?

09:01.900 --> 09:02.900
Don't they have a version of this on PS2?

09:02.900 --> 09:03.900
Yes.

09:03.900 --> 09:04.900
Well, it's out there everywhere.

09:04.900 --> 09:09.900
They've announced that they have sold 3 million copies of the game.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.900
10 million Rockband songs have been downloaded.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.900
4 million of those since March 20th, just about 6 weeks ago.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.900
Damn.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.900
So, yeah, 3 million copies of the game, 10 million.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.900
That means, on the average, people are buying 3 or 4 songs a pop.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.900
And how much do each song cost?

09:27.900 --> 09:32.900
About 2 bucks, depending on what platform and what song.

09:32.900 --> 09:33.900
So, on average, about...

09:33.900 --> 09:37.900
I'm wondering if they're counting those albums as 12 songs sold, though, but I guess they can.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.900
I mean, because they charge more for those, so...

09:39.900 --> 09:41.900
But, and how many people really bought that album?

09:41.900 --> 09:44.900
I'm sure there's plenty. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the artist, but...

09:44.900 --> 09:45.900
I bought a lot of songs on there.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.900
I bought quite a few, too, I gotta admit.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.900
I don't know why I buy them, because I have them in...

09:49.900 --> 09:53.900
I don't either, but it's the ultimate party game, because, like, you're glad to have them when people are over.

09:53.900 --> 09:57.900
You guys are so funny. Like, I don't know why I buy them, but I bought them.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.900
Just, I have those Microsoft points burning a hole in my pocket.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
I'm telling you, that's why that stuff is evil.

10:01.900 --> 10:06.900
Because Microsoft, it's so easy to just press that one little button and, doop, spend Microsoft points.

10:06.900 --> 10:07.900
Or add more.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.900
If you need to reload, doop, just add more points.

10:09.900 --> 10:10.900
It's dangerous.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.900
You're not spending money, you're just spending points.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.900
Exactly. I don't notice it until I look at my bank statement and I go,

10:15.900 --> 10:19.900
Son of a bitch, I just bought, like, 40 bucks worth of Microsoft points this month.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.900
What do I have to speak for it?

10:21.900 --> 10:23.900
I bought JIRUS.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.900
That's pretty smart, though, that they...

10:25.900 --> 10:26.900
It is.

10:26.900 --> 10:27.900
Scary.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.900
Oh.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.900
What?

10:29.900 --> 10:32.900
We're going on the tangent train, unfortunately.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.900
Oh, dear God. Alright, what's up?

10:33.900 --> 10:37.900
I'm sorry, you know, because you know me, I'm looking up last minute stories and stuff.

10:37.900 --> 10:38.900
Sure, sure.

10:38.900 --> 10:44.900
And I had to mention this because it just, poof, they had a big little thing in the corner of the screen here.

10:44.900 --> 11:01.900
Apparently, at Maker Faire 2008 today, MacGyver creator and Lee David Zlotov announced that he is making a big budget MacGyver movie.

11:01.900 --> 11:02.900
Fuck yeah.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.900
Yeah, but they're bastardizing everything we left in the 80s.

11:05.900 --> 11:06.900
Yeah, whatever, who cares.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.900
18 movie coming out, too. I mean...

11:08.900 --> 11:13.900
Why didn't they make these movies when they were popular? I don't understand. When MacGyver was still on the air.

11:13.900 --> 11:19.900
It's the whole retro thing. It's just like a few years ago, 70s retro. Like, they remade Charlie's Angels, they remade the Brady Bunch, right?

11:19.900 --> 11:24.900
Now the 80s are coming. Dude, it's just a matter of time before we get the Facts of Life movie.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.900
Who would they cast as Natalie in Tootie?

11:26.900 --> 11:27.900
I don't know.

11:27.900 --> 11:28.900
In Tootie.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.900
I don't know, I just kind of think it's a no.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.900
Rumor is the movie will be made out of a shoelace.

11:33.900 --> 11:34.900
Shut up.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.900
Limbs and a jar of peanut butter.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.900
Can you take us back to video games, please?

11:40.900 --> 11:52.900
Sorry. Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting news coming out with, what is it, Guitar Hero.

11:52.900 --> 11:58.900
Apparently Aerosmith, of course, you know, there's the Aerosmith Guitar Hero game coming out soon.

11:58.900 --> 12:09.900
They are locked into an exclusive contract with Guitar Hero and unfortunately no download content will be coming out for Rock Band featuring Aerosmith.

12:09.900 --> 12:16.900
Now I'm not sure if this is going to be forever. I'm assuming it's just for a matter, you know, a length of time, but I mean, God, who cares?

12:16.900 --> 12:22.900
It meaning there's an escape clause in it should Guitar Hero tank in the near future so Aerosmith can get in on the other game.

12:22.900 --> 12:23.900
Yeah.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.900
It's got to be that.

12:24.900 --> 12:36.900
It says apparently excluding, I guess, Rock Band's train kept on rolling, Aerosmith's entire catalog of Rock and Roll hits will be exclusive to Guitar Hero.

12:36.900 --> 12:46.900
And it says Newsweek got confirmation that the Aerosmith publicist and Activision PR that the band's songs would be locked down for an unspecified period of time.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.900
So that is for a limited amount of time.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.900
Meaning there's an escape clause, just in case.

12:51.900 --> 12:58.900
Yeah. And you know what? I mean, it really would be for their best interest to get their song out there as many places as possible.

12:58.900 --> 13:09.900
But, you know, hey, if they're going to throw a lot of money at you for, you know, a certain amount of time of, you know, exclusivity, I guess, more power to them, I guess.

13:09.900 --> 13:20.900
Alright. Well, you know, I don't know. I have a real problem with this kind of stuff because I see this as the beginning, it's the little pebble that starts the snowball that starts the avalanche.

13:20.900 --> 13:29.900
Because we all know, you know, we heard last week Guitar Hero 4 is supposedly following in Rock Band's footsteps where they're going to be adding voice, they're going to be adding drums, possibly.

13:29.900 --> 13:34.900
I mean, a lot of it's speculation. You know, we know there's one. But the thing is, will both play nice?

13:34.900 --> 13:39.900
Or am I going to have to have two of everything, like Noah's frickin' Ark in my gaming closet?

13:39.900 --> 13:45.900
If it's up to Activision, if it's up to Activision, then no they won't. But, if it's up to Microsoft, then yes they will.

13:45.900 --> 13:52.900
And remember, Microsoft, they have strict regulations about their accessories and peripherals that they all have to play nice with each other.

13:52.900 --> 13:58.900
Well, you know what? That shit pisses me off if they don't play nice. And when I get pissed off, we do the FUs of the week.

13:58.900 --> 14:16.900
LOKI, why don't you start us off tonight, since Dark Sakura is not here?

14:16.900 --> 14:24.900
FUs to Gravity for pulling the mustard out of my sandwich and staining my shirt and my shorts with delicious mustard.

14:24.900 --> 14:30.900
Rice Princess, since you're filling in tonight, would you care to give an FU for anything?

14:30.900 --> 14:35.900
FU to Hollywood After Dark for showing Rue McClanahan stripping.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.900
Do we need to describe Bad Movie Night really quick?

14:39.900 --> 14:40.900
Yeah, do it, do it.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.900
Give him a rundown of Bad Movie Night. You haven't talked at all tonight.

14:42.900 --> 14:43.900
No, Matt should do it.

14:43.900 --> 14:44.900
Alright, man.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.900
Okay, Bad Movie Night is where we pick bad movies, bad but entertaining movies to watch.

14:48.900 --> 14:55.900
Sadly, none of my movies got picked. I brought Follow That Bird, the Sesame Street adaptation from 1980s, but my choice was not screened last night.

14:55.900 --> 15:01.900
It wasn't bad enough, I guess. It wasn't that bad of a movie. It was just a classic.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.900
We're all pushing 30. It's pretty bad in retrospect.

15:04.900 --> 15:13.900
No, no, no. Okay, we watched Sleepaway Camp, which I've seen numerous times, but there were a few people that hadn't seen it yet, so that's funny.

15:13.900 --> 15:17.900
I swear to God, I'll ban you from chat if you ruin the twist ending to Sleepaway Camp.

15:17.900 --> 15:18.900
Yeah, do not do it.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.900
Best twist ending ever in a movie, Sleepaway Camp.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.900
And if you haven't seen it, watch it immediately.

15:23.900 --> 15:28.900
You need to watch it, and I swear to God, strap yourself through the chair and force yourself to watch it. The twist ending is worth it.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.900
Yeah, just get through it.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.900
And you gotta love the line where the guy goes, I gotta take a wicked dump.

15:35.900 --> 15:36.900
That's awesome.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.900
I love Sleepaway Camp. That's the ultimate bad movie.

15:39.900 --> 15:44.900
Then we watched this other movie, which, what was it? It was like something ninjas?

15:44.900 --> 15:47.900
We watched it fast-forward, Karate Kidz.

15:47.900 --> 15:52.900
Karate Kidz USA, I think is what it was called. Oh my God, it was horrible.

15:52.900 --> 16:04.900
We fast-forwarded through most of that, but there was a part where the kid called this black biker a souffle, which I don't know how that's an insult, but whatever, and he's all, no one calls me a souffle, I'll see you later.

16:04.900 --> 16:10.900
Like, what? And they basically have the battle, like, hillbillies in the forest or something.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.900
Alright, so tell us about the Rue McClanahan movie.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.900
So the Rue McClanahan movie, that was Hollywood After Dark.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.900
By the way, she was Blanche on the Golden Girls, just in case you didn't know.

16:18.900 --> 16:26.900
It was Hollywood After Dark. It's actually, the film was a part of this, what do they call it, the film crew.

16:26.900 --> 16:35.900
It's the guys that did Mystery Science the year 3000, but now it's essentially the same damn thing, which is without the robots, and now they can swear and stuff during that.

16:35.900 --> 16:44.900
It was pretty funny, but she was playing the stripper, and they made her strip, and it was, some of the comments they made there were really funny.

16:44.900 --> 16:50.900
And then there was these weird chicks that they had stripping. There was no nudity in this movie whatsoever.

16:50.900 --> 16:51.900
It was made in the 60s, so it was still taboo.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.900
They had pasties with sparset.

16:53.900 --> 16:58.900
But they had some really ugly people just stripping, I guess.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.900
And the stripping just went on and on.

17:01.900 --> 17:06.900
I know, that's what was making me bored. I'm like, oh my god, there's only so many funny things you can say about a woman stripping, but it keeps...

17:06.900 --> 17:09.900
Like, doesn't Mystery Science Theater usually cut down the movies a little bit?

17:09.900 --> 17:10.900
No.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.900
Really? I thought they always cut it down for broadcast. Oh well.

17:13.900 --> 17:19.900
Anyhow, funny stuff. I was thinking, we should do a Justin.TV thing where we make fun of movies.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.900
That'd be great.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.900
Jamie would love that too, she loves bad movies.

17:23.900 --> 17:30.900
You can go to the film crew's website, and they have podcasts that are meant for different movies, and you can play them at the same time as you're watching them.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
Like newer movies?

17:31.900 --> 17:32.900
Newer movies, yeah.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
Nice.

17:33.900 --> 17:40.900
And so, I mean, I highly, after watching this, because this seriously was, it's the same Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.900
I mean, absolutely, without a doubt.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.900
I mean, just nothing cut down whatsoever, no water down.

17:45.900 --> 17:51.900
In fact, it was a little bit better, I think, because they were able to say stuff like, you know, make famous jokes and stuff like that.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.900
But absolutely awesome. Check out the website.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.900
Alright, we got on a tangent.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.900
The F.U. of the week goes to the fact that, well, this is actually a good thing.

18:00.900 --> 18:05.900
It's been one month since I've been out of the hospital as of today for, you know, when I was in there for pancreatitis.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.900
But the F.U. goes to the fact that I'm not sure it's completely gone.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.900
Like, I still get chest pains once in a while, and that's kind of irritating.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.900
But I found that on Friday.

18:12.900 --> 18:13.900
We'll see.

18:13.900 --> 18:14.900
F.U. to blood tests.

18:14.900 --> 18:22.900
Especially when the nurse doesn't take, or the nurse gives you this really horrible tape that, I swear to God, I've tried to wash this off like five times this week, and the residue from the tape is still not coming off.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.900
Wow, that's gross.

18:23.900 --> 18:24.900
I know, it just won't come off.

18:24.900 --> 18:25.900
Try alcohol.

18:25.900 --> 18:26.900
That's what I'm gonna have to do.

18:26.900 --> 18:27.900
Horrible.

18:27.900 --> 18:28.900
Not the drinkable alcohol.

18:28.900 --> 18:29.900
I know that.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.900
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.900
Talk about Fatal Inertia.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.900
Fatal Inertia, this is the interesting thing about it.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.900
It was going to be coming out as a PlayStation 3 launch title.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.900
Then, apparently, it was gonna be on the Xbox 360.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.900
Now it's back on the PlayStation Network.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.900
It came out for the 360.

18:50.900 --> 18:51.900
Did it?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.900
Yeah, it did, like, last September, I think.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.900
As an arcade title?

18:54.900 --> 18:56.900
No, as a full-blown title.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.900
Oh, I thought this was an arcade title.

18:58.900 --> 19:02.900
This game, I had high hopes on it, because originally when they were first showing up,

19:02.900 --> 19:09.900
like, pre-PS3 launch, this game looked like it was gonna be just like F-Zero or something

19:09.900 --> 19:13.900
like that, a combat racing game, but I played the demo of it, and the demo kinda sucked,

19:13.900 --> 19:17.900
but I hear that the demo wasn't a really good representation of the game, but now they're

19:17.900 --> 19:19.900
supposed to be making it better.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.900
Interesting.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.900
The EX, Facial Inertia EX is coming out to the PlayStation Network.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.900
See, that's what confuses me, because it was coming on PSN, whereas the other one was on

19:28.900 --> 19:30.900
360, so I thought it was an arcade title.

19:30.900 --> 19:31.900
Alright, I get it now.

19:31.900 --> 19:35.900
Well, I guess not a lot of people got it on the 360, because I didn't even know about

19:35.900 --> 19:36.900
it, but here's the thing.

19:36.900 --> 19:40.900
They're gonna be adding to it a brand new training mode, more tracks in the game, and

19:40.900 --> 19:41.900
apparently the game is not as difficult.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.900
They've actually lowered the difficulty a little bit.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.900
Well, the track, the thing I didn't like about the game was the track design was really

19:47.900 --> 19:48.900
confusing.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.900
It was hard to tell where you're supposed to go, and you get lost pretty easy.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.900
$29.99 late May is when this game is coming out.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.900
Yeah, that's about the price I think the other one was, too.

19:57.900 --> 20:00.900
I think it was $39.99 when it came out.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.900
So, awesome.

20:02.900 --> 20:07.900
So, Mega Man has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records Gamer's Edition.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.900
I actually had a chance to check this out at a bookstore the other day.

20:11.900 --> 20:16.900
I thought it was pretty well put together, but I still laugh at the fact that there's

20:16.900 --> 20:20.900
gaming world records in there, and they're kind of retarded, but whatever.

20:20.900 --> 20:27.900
But apparently there are 46 Mega Man games in existence, making it the largest, I guess,

20:27.900 --> 20:30.900
franchise out there.

20:30.900 --> 20:35.900
There are 17 games in the classic series, 11 Mega Man X games, 4 Mega Man Zero games,

20:35.900 --> 20:41.900
2 Mega Man ZX games, 3 Mega Man Legend games, 6 Mega Man Battle Network games, and 3 Mega

20:41.900 --> 20:43.900
Man Star Force games.

20:43.900 --> 20:51.900
And I know there's a lot more coming out as well.

20:51.900 --> 20:52.900
Lots of Mega Man.

20:52.900 --> 20:53.900
You know, I was tempted, though.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.900
The other day I saw the Mega Man Collection, which was a game I think I rented once.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.900
It's great, because the old school Mega Man games are awesome, and they have the new one

21:01.900 --> 21:04.900
that came out, well, it's not that new now, but it came out on PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

21:04.900 --> 21:08.900
Well, you can play old GameCube games on your Wii, and that blockbuster we went to to get

21:08.900 --> 21:12.900
Sleepaway Camp the other day had the Mega Man Collection for sale for GameCube, but

21:12.900 --> 21:13.900
previously played copy.

21:13.900 --> 21:14.900
15 bucks.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.900
Nice.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.900
I almost bought it.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.900
Well, so here's the thing.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.900
So I'm thinking, like, why not buy that, and then, you know, because it's going to come

21:20.900 --> 21:21.900
out on Virtual Console eventually.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.900
I thought it was 1999 when it first came out, so.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.900
Yeah, but still.

21:24.900 --> 21:25.900
A few years ago.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.900
15 is not bad.

21:27.900 --> 21:28.900
It's cheap.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.900
It's like six, seven Mega Man games.

21:30.900 --> 21:31.900
Eight, maybe.

21:31.900 --> 21:32.900
I don't remember how many were in there, but a lot.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.900
Well, only three of them are really even worth playing anyway.

21:34.900 --> 21:35.900
That's true.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.900
And that was the first three that were ever created, so.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.900
All the rest of them.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.900
Hitstun says, don't get the GameCube one.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.900
Why not?

21:41.900 --> 21:44.900
I thought the GameCube one had the remixed music, which was cool.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.900
There, I want to say that each version had, like, there was a PlayStation 2 and then there

21:48.900 --> 21:52.900
was a GameCube one, and I think each one had, like, a different unlockable game in

21:52.900 --> 21:53.900
there or something.

21:53.900 --> 21:54.900
Hmm.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.900
All right, well, whatever.

21:55.900 --> 21:59.180
I'm probably not actually going to get the game anyway, because, you know, Irene's going

21:59.180 --> 22:00.180
to call me this week.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.180
She's going to be like, dude, Rob, Karazhan.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.180
Rob, Karazhan.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.900
I know, and I'm going to be like, oh, fuck Mega Man.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.020
All right.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.900
Let's read some mail.

22:07.900 --> 22:17.900
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, if you'd like to send us some emails, we will read

22:17.900 --> 22:18.900
them on air.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.460
Dark Soccer's not here tonight, so I'm filling in, reading some email from our listeners,

22:22.460 --> 22:26.740
and I got to say this, kids, you guys wrote a lot of emails this week, and so we can only

22:26.740 --> 22:28.140
really read so many.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.100
Dark Soccer's usually very nice, and she'll try to read them all.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.100
I am not as nice.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.100
I apologize.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.100
No, actually, I don't.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.740
We've got a show to do here, and we want to get out of here at 4, you know, 11 o'clock,

22:35.740 --> 22:37.860
so I'm going to pick some tonight.

22:37.860 --> 22:41.300
Really quickly, ShadowCharlie sent us an email about this whole article.

22:41.300 --> 22:45.220
He basically copy-pasted an article about the Mothers Against Drunk Driving Attacking

22:45.220 --> 22:46.700
Grand Theft Auto 4.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.700
Retarded.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.700
And why is that?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.100
Well, let me give you the gist of what happened.

22:50.100 --> 22:54.540
Basically, they're pissed because you can actually drive drunk in the game, and I believe

22:54.540 --> 22:56.820
it's the objective of one of the missions in the game.

22:56.820 --> 23:00.140
They're claiming Grand Theft Auto should be re-rated as adults only.

23:00.140 --> 23:02.700
It's not, that's the spin that they were putting on it.

23:02.700 --> 23:07.420
There is no, I mean, you can drive drunk in the game, but they tell you that, you know,

23:07.420 --> 23:11.980
even when you, it's one of the dates, whatever, you go in there and you can drink and stuff,

23:11.980 --> 23:16.580
and you can either try to drive home, which is pretty difficult, and the police will catch

23:16.580 --> 23:17.580
you.

23:17.580 --> 23:22.980
I mean, they'll see, notice that you're driving drunk if you do try, and it also suggests

23:22.980 --> 23:27.460
right as you're coming out of the bar, it says, well, maybe you should take a cab, and

23:27.460 --> 23:31.340
you can hail a cab, you know, to take you back home, but, you know.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.260
Sensationalism around Grand Theft Auto 4?

23:33.260 --> 23:34.260
I know, it's crazy.

23:34.260 --> 23:35.260
Oh, surely you jest.

23:35.260 --> 23:39.820
Yeah, I know, and people like, you know, claiming things that aren't actually in the game, yeah,

23:39.820 --> 23:40.820
that's surprising.

23:40.820 --> 23:44.820
See, that's so stupid, because you can do other shit in the games.

23:44.820 --> 23:50.220
Yeah, murder okay, truck driving, whoa, that's taking it too far.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.860
Excuse me, sir, you gotta change your rating.

23:51.860 --> 23:56.180
Frisbee in chat is screaming, it's not real driving, it's not real drunk.

23:56.180 --> 23:57.380
Yeah, it's all.

23:57.380 --> 24:01.460
It is pretty cool the way it's done, though, like the whole camera shakes around and stuff,

24:01.460 --> 24:05.220
and randomly your car will swerve in different directions, and you have to kind of, you know,

24:05.220 --> 24:09.500
counter-steer for that, but I like it, I think it's pretty cool.

24:09.500 --> 24:13.220
You know, you can ride animals while drunk in World of Warcraft, and no one says anything

24:13.220 --> 24:14.220
about that.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.220
That's true.

24:15.220 --> 24:19.180
No one said anything about, was it Saints Row, you could get high and stoned and stuff

24:19.180 --> 24:25.220
in that game, you can also get drunk and drive around and kill people, in fact, they kind

24:25.220 --> 24:28.820
of insist that when you are drunk, you have superpowers and you can punch people really

24:28.820 --> 24:32.660
far away, so I don't know, I don't know.

24:32.660 --> 24:33.660
Interesting.

24:33.660 --> 24:40.060
Alright, moving on to the next email from GS68, hey OLR crew, specifically Loki and

24:40.060 --> 24:44.060
Rob Rob Rob, I have a bad feeling about your appearance at Fonami, you're not listed under

24:44.060 --> 24:49.060
the panel section of the Fonami2008 site at fonami.com, are you gonna try and make a last

24:49.060 --> 24:52.060
minute arrangement or something, if there's no OLR panel this year, then I suppose us

24:52.060 --> 24:56.220
Bay Area OLR fans will just have to find some other way to meet up at Fonami, less than

24:56.220 --> 25:00.900
slash three GS68, this email brought to you by Hooters, home of the never-ending girl's

25:00.900 --> 25:04.700
thoughts, god that Olive Garden thing has caught on, everybody's signing their emails

25:04.700 --> 25:08.300
of strange things now, uh yeah, we're gonna have to break the news to you, we are not

25:08.300 --> 25:11.460
attending Fonami this year, we do not plan on doing a live panel this year, it is nothing

25:11.460 --> 25:15.820
against Fonami, we still love the staff and everything, the thing is that, you know, Jamie

25:15.820 --> 25:19.500
has other plans this year, and quite frankly, we just kind of, you know, it's a three day

25:19.500 --> 25:23.660
weekend, it's one of the few that us working kids have during the year, and so we just

25:23.660 --> 25:28.040
want to take the weekend to kind of do other things, and also since we're gonna be hopefully

25:28.040 --> 25:32.180
doing packs and some other shows later in the year, we've just decided to sit this one

25:32.180 --> 25:39.020
out, sorry, is anybody going to Fonami just for fun, in curiosity, no, no, not that, you

25:39.020 --> 25:43.060
always go, this is the first year you haven't been to Fonami in a long time, isn't it, no

25:43.060 --> 25:47.900
it hasn't, I thought you went like every year, I used to like when I was in the anime, what

25:47.900 --> 25:54.020
like five years ago, but you know, and even then, it was only really like three years

25:54.020 --> 25:59.420
in a row. Well still, those of you guys that are going to Fonami, we hope you have a lot,

25:59.420 --> 26:05.460
a lot of fun, and good luck. ASEN is being yelled in chat, and ASEN is too soon, ASEN

26:05.460 --> 26:11.380
is very soon, the problem is, I was originally wanting to go to ASEN, but my medical things

26:11.380 --> 26:15.460
came up and I had to put it aside, because you know, that kind of stuff is more important

26:15.460 --> 26:20.660
for me right now, maybe next year, I'm really hoping. Packs is the most definite right now,

26:20.660 --> 26:25.900
and you never know what else might happen in the future, if you have a con that's drivable,

26:25.900 --> 26:31.780
or let's say in California, or like Reno, or even Oregon, hell, let us know, we'll try

26:31.780 --> 26:35.980
to come if you'd like to have us there, otherwise if it's something we've got to fly to, it

26:35.980 --> 26:39.500
just depends on the budget, and by budget, I mean how much money we have in our pockets,

26:39.500 --> 26:44.980
because we don't, you notice we don't run ads on this show, meaning we have no money.

26:44.980 --> 26:49.220
Mark from Plymouth, England sends us the next email, it's a bit long, so I'm just going

26:49.220 --> 26:54.180
to read some of this here, he says, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, although the track of this

26:54.180 --> 26:58.140
message may lead you to at first think that I might be. I want to start by saying that

26:58.140 --> 27:02.420
here in the UK there's no real Nintendo history, as back as in the 80s, Commodore 64 and ZX

27:02.420 --> 27:06.100
Spectrum ruled the gaming of everyone, and Nintendo was almost unknown to me and my friends

27:06.100 --> 27:10.600
until I was too old and busy with serious things, busy with serious dating to get back

27:10.600 --> 27:15.540
into it, here the NES and SNES were pretty much unknown things. Now my main point, Wii

27:15.540 --> 27:19.660
isn't increasing the gamer base, as mentioned by you on episode 277, and often it's a war

27:19.660 --> 27:23.740
cry by many of the too many podcasts I listen to. I know you don't hate the Wii and are

27:23.740 --> 27:28.620
open about its strengths and weaknesses, however I believe not as my personal experience as

27:28.620 --> 27:32.660
I am a gamer, definitely not hardcore, although I'm very much into all the latest news, I'm

27:32.660 --> 27:37.100
presently most all about handhelds due to access issues to the big ass TV. My Wii is

27:37.100 --> 27:41.420
also freely played by my wife, who would categorize herself as a non-gamer and her family, in

27:41.420 --> 27:45.340
fact my next night shift has been scheduled for a Wii Fit night, in which my wife invited

27:45.340 --> 27:49.680
her friends and sisters for drinks and laughs on the board. This type of sociability has

27:49.680 --> 27:53.580
led all in the family to believe, all the family to buying Wii's, and they are now the

27:53.580 --> 27:58.060
prime console, the collateral fallout is that many others in the household now play, whereas

27:58.060 --> 28:02.500
before one person, maybe two, per household played the kids and parents are buying games

28:02.500 --> 28:08.360
for the Wii. Is there any figures on players per console for old and present gen? I'd like

28:08.360 --> 28:15.060
to bet the figure has risen. Is there anything like that? I doubt it. I don't know. I'm gonna

28:15.060 --> 28:17.820
kind of cut some of this email out that he was just sort of making the point that, you

28:17.820 --> 28:22.220
know, the Wii is definitely kind of caught on in that way, but what about, you know,

28:22.220 --> 28:26.180
the software? He talks about why do some shovelware games sell well? Is that the taste of light

28:26.180 --> 28:30.180
gamers are different and a lot of early games to the Wii are games ported over from PS2

28:30.180 --> 28:34.500
games? It's because people don't know any better, the moms and pops that are going to

28:34.500 --> 28:39.020
like stores that are buying their kids games, they look at it, they're like, okay well they

28:39.020 --> 28:42.660
can get Mario Kart and they can get this other game that looks very similar, and all they

28:42.660 --> 28:45.860
have to go by is the pictures on the back and stuff and the price point and they're

28:45.860 --> 28:51.300
like, well it's, you know, it's $20 cheaper or $30 cheaper, so hey let's go ahead and

28:51.300 --> 28:55.500
give it a shot. And unfortunately it's just like movies, you know, you may like go to

28:55.500 --> 28:59.060
your, you know, Reynolds store or whatever and you're looking at the back of the movie

28:59.060 --> 29:02.660
and all you have to go by is the cover and, you know, what it says on the back and you

29:02.660 --> 29:07.700
can bring it home and it's complete shit, so. Alright, let's get to Mark's second half

29:07.700 --> 29:11.700
here where he has a question. I still haven't dipped my toes into the HD gaming experience.

29:11.700 --> 29:16.300
I like the PS3 but I'm not sure due to price and limited titles, although a good six would

29:16.300 --> 29:19.660
do me for now. I hate Metal Gear Solid as it just doesn't float my boat personally.

29:19.660 --> 29:23.780
I hate cut scenes. The Xbox 360 has a catalog but I get burned on the original Xbox when

29:23.780 --> 29:27.980
shortly after buying one they went and retired it for the 360. Also my brother has gone through

29:27.980 --> 29:32.700
four 360s. So is now a good time to buy a 360? Have the issues of Red Ring of Death

29:32.700 --> 29:36.420
been cured or should I wait a little longer as the trading games pile is getting bigger

29:36.420 --> 29:40.780
every day? Is the smaller, cooler 360 on the horizon? I know it's an old question from

29:40.780 --> 29:46.100
last year and before but now the 360 is maturing or has it lost its legs and arthritis is setting

29:46.100 --> 29:50.540
in or is now the time to jump in? And the arcade is cheaper than the Wii right now.

29:50.540 --> 29:55.100
I have no intention of going online. Is a hard drive necessary for the download content

29:55.100 --> 30:00.100
or do I have to accept the patches or the wave of the future? I would say that it's

30:00.100 --> 30:07.180
probably fine to buy it now. I think 360 is probably going to be at its peak for the next

30:07.180 --> 30:11.220
couple of years. You're right, the system has matured but that's when all the really

30:11.220 --> 30:13.860
good games start coming out over the next couple of years and then we'll start getting

30:13.860 --> 30:18.940
into a new cycle of systems. As far as hardware problems go, the new 360s that they have out

30:18.940 --> 30:23.860
now aren't really as prone to the hardware problems. The main one that people are worried

30:23.860 --> 30:28.280
about is the 3 Ring thing and they've still got the extended warranty on it. So I would

30:28.280 --> 30:32.580
say you're probably better off now buying a newer console but just make sure you're

30:32.580 --> 30:37.900
buying a newer console and not a refurbished older one. That's pretty much it. Here's what

30:37.900 --> 30:43.620
you've got to watch out for is that maybe a new 360 is going to come out. This is really

30:43.620 --> 30:46.780
inevitable with every console but there were some strong rumors this week. I don't think

30:46.780 --> 30:49.820
I'm spoiling anything on show. There were some very strong rumors this week about the

30:49.820 --> 30:55.260
Blu-ray and I guess actually a press release was put out so it might be more than rumor.

30:55.260 --> 31:01.060
Blu-ray or the Xbox 360 is actually going to be getting a Blu-ray in it. Somebody's

31:01.060 --> 31:06.220
been contracted to actually put that technology together where the Blu-ray, Xbox 360 is going

31:06.220 --> 31:10.940
to be coming out because HD DVD is officially dead. Microsoft is left with no choice but

31:10.940 --> 31:13.940
to get on the Blu-ray board if they want their system to play movies as well. They're not

31:13.940 --> 31:18.380
DVD, HD movies. So you've got to be careful because you never know what's going to happen.

31:18.380 --> 31:23.860
The day after you buy your system, this might come out but that's just a chance you take.

31:23.860 --> 31:29.300
It happens with anything. Ask anyone who owns an Apple product. You buy an iPhone and then

31:29.300 --> 31:35.060
a few months later, super iPhone! Watch, there will be a super iPhone this year just so you

31:35.060 --> 31:42.300
know. RossdielUT wrote us and wanted to get in a few words about this. I want to get in

31:42.300 --> 31:46.420
a few words on the idea of gays in gaming. Sexuality isn't anywhere near as taboo as

31:46.420 --> 31:49.620
it was five or so years ago. Now it seems that every other game is so chock full of

31:49.620 --> 31:53.780
cock teasing that it borders on the tasteless. Dead or Alive is built entirely upon sexual

31:53.780 --> 31:57.140
exploitation and the guy game was only pulled off the shelves because it featured an underage

31:57.140 --> 32:01.240
girl going topless. The reason we don't see gay characters in games or even a very deep

32:01.240 --> 32:05.540
exploration of sexuality besides making women as slutty as possible has nothing to do with

32:05.540 --> 32:09.380
the rating systems out there. Conan, a god of war, had frontal nudity as you know. The

32:09.380 --> 32:13.180
problem here is the striking lack of diversity in the gaming industry. While game players

32:13.180 --> 32:17.720
come from all faiths, colors, creeds, and orientations, game developers do not. The

32:17.720 --> 32:21.020
overwhelming majority of game developers in the West are straight white men who in turn

32:21.020 --> 32:26.040
only know how to make games aimed at straight white men. I imagine any meeting of game developers

32:26.040 --> 32:31.020
in the West sounding like something straight out of Xbox Live with the types of things

32:31.020 --> 32:36.500
you hear there on Xbox Live. What do you think so far? Do you think that might be why you

32:36.500 --> 32:41.500
don't see it is because of the people developing it? But I'm always of the mindset that well

32:41.500 --> 32:45.580
if you want to get other audiences into gaming maybe you ought to start putting that kind

32:45.580 --> 32:51.060
of stuff into games. Well I think that also they also run the problem with like the ESRB.

32:51.060 --> 32:57.740
They rate that kind of crap, you know, more offensive than female nudity. Alright well

32:57.740 --> 33:01.260
Rastu goes on, of course I can't talk about this without mentioning the audience. Go to

33:01.260 --> 33:05.260
any internet gaming forum, for that matter Xbox Live, and you'll find rampant sexism

33:05.260 --> 33:09.100
and homophobia. One need only look at what happened to Jade Raymond, leading up to the

33:09.100 --> 33:13.260
launch of Assassin's Creed. For months last year, sites like Kotaku and Joystiq were more

33:13.260 --> 33:17.080
concerned with making creepy blogs about how nice she looked and smelled than covering

33:17.080 --> 33:22.600
the goddamn game. The idiocy climax in a horrific comic depicting Jade, a well-educated, experienced

33:22.600 --> 33:26.860
professional game developer, as a brainless bimbo who can't even pronounce creative, trying

33:26.860 --> 33:30.980
to get sales for the game by sucking off nerds ending in a bukkake scene. Given the gaming

33:30.980 --> 33:35.420
industry's absolute incompetence when it comes to marketing and demographics research, everyone

33:35.420 --> 33:39.440
assumes that the sexist and homophobes are the only people interested in games. The lack

33:39.440 --> 33:44.180
of game sales on the Wii only helps to further this misconception. Thus we get more objectified

33:44.180 --> 33:48.980
women and the role of gay characters is limited to the joke character like Makoto from Enchanted

33:48.980 --> 33:54.220
Arms. With time, as gaming businesses learn the importance of demographics and stop belittling

33:54.220 --> 33:58.620
people who aren't straight, white men, this will pass, we just need to hang on. Ross Deal

33:58.620 --> 34:04.980
UT, this message brought to you by Pizza Hut, makers of the pure grease pizza. So, I don't

34:04.980 --> 34:10.760
know. What do you think, Irene? You're a woman, an OMG girl that plays video games. Do you

34:10.760 --> 34:17.760
think that games aren't coming out geared more towards women because... See, there's

34:18.540 --> 34:24.420
a stereotype that women love playing puzzle games. I don't think it's so much that as

34:24.420 --> 34:29.700
it is puzzle games don't have overly sexualized women in the games. As the woman that plays

34:29.700 --> 34:34.580
puzzle pirates? No, yeah. I mean, that's part of the reason, because I don't have to think

34:34.580 --> 34:38.900
about like, okay, I'm going to see some, you know, slutty things, some woman like, you

34:38.900 --> 34:43.940
know, slutified in this game or whatever, but... Although, that sounds like a good idea

34:43.940 --> 34:50.940
for a puzzle game. Puzzle Sluts. Yay! OMG, let's put that on the OLR dream game list.

34:51.140 --> 34:56.300
What would Puzzle Sluts be? It would just be like an over-sexified version of like,

34:56.300 --> 34:58.900
you know, any sort of puzzle game. It's gotta be better than Bubble Bath Babes, though.

34:58.900 --> 35:05.140
It's gotta be much better than that. How exactly would Puzzle Sluts work? Well, they have like...

35:05.140 --> 35:09.020
But they need to have, okay, there needs to be like a code that you put in, like up, up,

35:09.020 --> 35:12.540
down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and you get male Puzzle Sluts. Because

35:12.540 --> 35:18.420
we need something for everybody in this game. Okay, I think I can see how this might work.

35:18.420 --> 35:24.300
You would have in each, like, so let's say, let's go the route of like, say, Puzzle Fighter,

35:24.300 --> 35:28.880
okay? Alright. So, you would have inside each one of the gems, like, a different woman.

35:28.880 --> 35:32.940
And when you break the gem, they would fall to the bottom of the screen and, you know,

35:32.940 --> 35:36.460
more gems next to each other and they just start kind of going at it in the bottom of

35:36.460 --> 35:44.460
the screen until you get this big orgy that pile up in the bottom. I like it. Brilliant.

35:44.460 --> 35:52.660
Brilliant. Patent pending. Nobody steal it. I don't know. Okay, like, here's a good example.

35:52.660 --> 35:57.660
Heavenly Sword. You know how the main character is like this hot chick that, you know, kicks

35:57.660 --> 36:02.740
ass and all that stuff. I was kind of detracted from it because it was just like, come on,

36:02.740 --> 36:08.500
you know, that's totally not realistic. Like, if she were just a normal girl, I probably

36:08.500 --> 36:12.820
would have been more inclined to play it. Been more focused on actual gameplay than,

36:12.820 --> 36:19.260
like, ogling over her or whatever. But I don't know. I think that something like putting,

36:19.260 --> 36:23.820
you know, gay characters or sensible women in games is something that's gonna have to

36:23.820 --> 36:28.900
be left up to independent, you know, game producers. Well, like, for example, Saints

36:28.900 --> 36:35.260
Row 2 that's coming out, you can be a male and or female character or you can be a transsexual

36:35.260 --> 36:40.220
in the game and run around and you can totally customize your characters and stuff. But you

36:40.220 --> 36:44.320
know people that are gonna be playing Saints Row aren't gonna be playing them, like, seriously.

36:44.320 --> 36:48.180
They're gonna be playing them to mock them. I gotta show you this, though. Now, does this

36:48.180 --> 36:52.340
pique your interest, Irene? Because this story came up earlier this week and I don't think

36:52.340 --> 36:56.740
it's on our show tonight, but Lost Planet Colonies is going to be, I guess they're getting

36:56.740 --> 37:01.140
a new version of it coming out. It's some type of expansion. One of the characters in

37:01.140 --> 37:07.140
it is the Dead Rising star, you know, Frank West, but he doesn't have clothes on. He's

37:07.140 --> 37:12.620
just wearing a skimpy little pair of blue and yellow boxer briefs. That's all he's wearing.

37:12.620 --> 37:17.560
Now, is that maybe the contrast to your Heavenly Sword? Would you maybe be interested in checking

37:17.560 --> 37:21.240
out Lost Planet Colonies? Because, hello, good looking man running around in his skimpy

37:21.240 --> 37:25.780
undies. See, that's debatable. I don't think he looks good. And he's kinda retarded to

37:25.780 --> 37:30.460
be running around on this, like, frozen wasteland. Yeah, it's kinda weird. He's like, I'm fine.

37:30.460 --> 37:36.100
Well, that won't do at all. Yeah. I guess sex does sell, but do they really need to

37:36.100 --> 37:39.940
sexualize people? I mean, there are plenty of good games. Act Deft, by the way, is clearing

37:39.940 --> 37:43.100
up. It's like the greatest hits version of the game. Yeah, they added more crap to it.

37:43.100 --> 37:47.940
See, I don't follow Lost Planet. Sorry, guys. Remember when games, you didn't even have

37:47.940 --> 37:53.860
to care about their sexuality? Mario walking around, like, in overalls and shit, you know,

37:53.860 --> 37:57.460
like, well, but as I think stories become more, I mean, let's face it, video games today

37:57.460 --> 38:03.340
are practically big-budget movies. Big, big-budget movies. And, you know, we, you know, kinda

38:03.340 --> 38:07.180
like to see that sort of representation in movies as well. And it took a while for movies

38:07.180 --> 38:11.340
to get there, but it got there. Okay, tell me which Yuna you like better. Do you like

38:11.340 --> 38:17.040
Yuna from Final Fantasy X, or do you like her better in X-2? Because, remember, she

38:17.040 --> 38:23.220
got all hella slutty in the second one. I, I guess as a character, I just like X's story

38:23.220 --> 38:29.300
better. So I liked her better in X, but X-2 is like bubblegum pop fun. X-2 is like, today

38:29.300 --> 38:35.100
I'm in the mood to listen to the Spice Girls because I'm just in that mood. Okay. Final

38:35.100 --> 38:39.540
Fantasy X is, today I'm listening to Depeche Mode because I'm emo. Okay, yeah, I guess

38:39.540 --> 38:45.220
it also depends on what kind of mood you're in. If you just wanna play, like, your motivation

38:45.220 --> 38:50.340
behind playing the game, but if it's strictly to, like, get off, it's just silly. It's like,

38:50.340 --> 38:54.860
come on. Is that what you're gonna base your game on? Some kind of, like, sexy character

38:54.860 --> 38:59.300
or something? You can't do more with what you have. You can't be creative. Alright,

38:59.300 --> 39:02.420
well let's, let's do some more emails here, cause I wanna get through the rest of these

39:02.420 --> 39:06.380
emails tonight. Ben from Tokyo has emailed us. Wanted to clear some things up. We were

39:06.380 --> 39:10.020
talking about Singapore. Speaking of, you know, the gays gaming thing, we talked to

39:10.020 --> 39:13.860
last week about how in Singapore, they're adding homosexuality to what is instantly

39:13.860 --> 39:18.620
making a game adults only overseas. And that was Mass Effect was impacted by that because

39:18.620 --> 39:23.460
it was OMG Lesbians for, like, five seconds in the game. So Ben wrote us, says, love the

39:23.460 --> 39:27.020
show, wanna keep it short, I have to rant about some stuff. Singapore. In Singapore

39:27.020 --> 39:32.180
it is basically illegal to be gay. Illegal as in, you go to jail. More precise would

39:32.180 --> 39:36.700
be to say that anything openly gay is banned. Gays are not employed by public offices, not

39:36.700 --> 39:41.020
allowed to live in certain areas. That part also holds for certain foreigners and homosexual

39:41.020 --> 39:44.680
acts are illegal. So complaining about the rating system is like accusing a serial killer

39:44.680 --> 39:48.780
of fashion crimes. By the way, it is only the American rating system that is crazy about

39:48.780 --> 39:53.600
sexual topics. That's just, it's so disheartening to read. I mean, you do have to remember that,

39:53.600 --> 39:58.760
you know, we are kind of lucky sometimes to live in a nation that, at least we don't get

39:58.760 --> 40:02.380
arrested for it, even though there's still a lot of progress to make. You know, you look

40:02.380 --> 40:08.880
at countries like Canada and Spain and wherever where gays can get married and it's just whatever.

40:08.880 --> 40:13.500
No one cares because it's not like OMG they're gonna come into my house and redecorate things.

40:13.500 --> 40:20.100
Watch out. It's, you know, it's just whatever, you know. People are so much more laid back

40:20.100 --> 40:24.060
and then sometimes you have to come to that harsh reality where like, wow, you know, America

40:24.060 --> 40:30.740
is way ahead of some other people. Kind of just sad. Just sad. Yeah, but even California

40:30.740 --> 40:36.900
is kind of more the exception anyway. I mean, if you go to any other place in the US, you

40:36.900 --> 40:42.460
probably, they probably won't be as accepting. Yeah, it depends. It just depends. Like I

40:42.460 --> 40:45.460
was saying last week, I think we're getting to a point, I think we're very lucky, where

40:45.460 --> 40:52.340
most 20-somethings and most younger 30-somethings and most teenagers even. I think teenagers

40:52.340 --> 40:56.820
even more so. Everybody knows someone who's gay and more and more people just have the

40:56.820 --> 41:02.540
attitude of whatever. It's no big deal. It's just whatever. They realize it doesn't mean

41:02.540 --> 41:08.460
they're suddenly gonna fuck me in the ass when I'm not looking. I think people are over

41:08.460 --> 41:12.780
that real kind of childish mentality about it, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like,

41:12.780 --> 41:16.380
is that what they're really afraid of? Like, oh my god, he's gonna come fuck me in the

41:16.380 --> 41:22.900
ass. I don't know. I have no idea. It's just comical to me. I'm left to assume. It's funny.

41:22.900 --> 41:28.060
I don't know. It is stupid. Alright. Copyright. Ben wanted to say something about copyright

41:28.060 --> 41:31.300
too. While you just mentioned it briefly, I have to say that downloading fan subs and

41:31.300 --> 41:35.140
any other copyrighted material is of course illegal, even if there is no licensing in

41:35.140 --> 41:38.720
your country. Without licensing, there is just nobody to complain about it. That doesn't

41:38.720 --> 41:43.580
make it legal. Thus, fan subs are in a somewhat gray area. Note that this only holds if your

41:43.580 --> 41:48.980
country has a copyright law, which, for example, Thailand at least didn't have for a long time.

41:48.980 --> 41:52.460
So that kind of came up on last week's show about the whole copyright thing went back

41:52.460 --> 41:58.460
and forth. So there you have it. More emails. I know there's a lot tonight, but actually

41:58.460 --> 42:03.600
these are pretty good. Rama emailed us very happy. There was a mention of video power

42:03.600 --> 42:08.180
on last week's show and was kind of running down video power a little bit. The first season

42:08.180 --> 42:12.180
at Johnny Arcade, he would come into the room, talk about games for five minutes that he's

42:12.180 --> 42:16.140
going to review, and then there was a 20-minute cartoon. But the second season was a game

42:16.140 --> 42:20.140
show. Four people would get a chance to ask Johnny a question to compete on the show.

42:20.140 --> 42:23.420
First round was getting the highest score in a game. Second round was trivia questions.

42:23.420 --> 42:27.300
After that was the round where you ran through the game area and you could get, you know,

42:27.300 --> 42:32.360
Jansport bags, Genesis, and Neo Geo console. I pretty much think that Acclaim did a majority

42:32.360 --> 42:36.180
of the sponsorship of the show, but I could be wrong. Well, that's it for now. Keep up

42:36.180 --> 42:41.500
the good work, and y'all in two months for OLRCon 2008. There's an OLRCon 2008?

42:41.500 --> 42:42.500
Yeah. Wow.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.060
Where the hell have I been?

42:45.060 --> 42:47.260
I don't know. Where have you been?

42:47.260 --> 42:50.940
I heard something was going down over 4th of July, but I didn't know we were like actually

42:50.940 --> 42:54.820
having a little convention. What the crap? Am I always the last one to hear about this?

42:54.820 --> 42:55.820
Hear about what?

42:55.820 --> 42:56.820
OLRCon.

42:56.820 --> 43:02.220
I guess there's an OLRCon happening. Like, I think it's 4th of July. I know. Rama, you

43:02.220 --> 43:04.820
need to email me and tell me. I've not been told about this.

43:04.820 --> 43:06.540
Nor have I.

43:06.540 --> 43:11.740
Or I forgot. You know what? I'm human. I might have forgot. I'll go. I mean, obviously, if

43:11.740 --> 43:17.100
it's OLRCon, I guess I'll go, but I'm just kind of curious what's going on. Well, let's

43:17.100 --> 43:21.620
advertise it on the show if something's going on.

43:21.620 --> 43:25.340
And lastly, Rama closes with, this email was brought to you by Joey Paisanos of Mulberry

43:25.340 --> 43:31.880
Street in the heart of Little Italy. You'll love Paisanos. Suddenly, everybody's attaching

43:31.880 --> 43:40.060
a commercial to their ads. Let's see. One more email for you guys. Again, I can't get

43:40.060 --> 43:41.060
to them all tonight.

43:41.060 --> 43:45.900
ShadowNextGen emails us, after you bashed IGN last week for giving Grand Theft Auto

43:45.900 --> 43:49.100
4 a 10 out of 10 and suggesting that something shady might be going on due to them having

43:49.100 --> 43:53.000
the exclusive, what is your opinion now that the majority of other sites have also given

43:53.000 --> 43:57.180
this game 10 out of 10 scores? I think RossdielUT was completely off the mark last week with

43:57.180 --> 44:00.740
his rants over reviews, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts. If a game is bad such

44:00.740 --> 44:04.380
as Laird, then the review scores will reflect it. If the game is good such as Grand Theft

44:04.380 --> 44:09.500
Auto 4, then the review scores will reflect that as well. Thoughts keep up the good work.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.820
Here it is. I never said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was probably not going to get 10s out

44:13.820 --> 44:17.580
of 10s from everywhere, and it's probably pretty deserving of those 10s out of 10s.

44:17.580 --> 44:22.180
I'm just saying that kind of policy about, you know, sure we'll accept the exclusive.

44:22.180 --> 44:26.260
What was it? I think they came out and admitted that they had traded for advertising on the

44:26.260 --> 44:30.820
site to get the exclusive review. I mean, that kind of sets a bad precedent because

44:30.820 --> 44:34.580
yes, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a good, good game, I don't know. What about games in the

44:34.580 --> 44:40.740
future? Yeah, because they said, oh yeah, this didn't affect our review score. Let's

44:40.740 --> 44:45.900
not forget about what went down at GameSpot and Kane and Lynch. Hello. Well, let's not

44:45.900 --> 44:50.920
forget what happened at GameSpot and Grand Theft Auto 4 where there was a review that

44:50.920 --> 44:56.100
leaked out that gave it a 9.5 and then that was retracted and there was a 10.0 review

44:56.100 --> 44:59.740
put out. You know, who's to say that they weren't going to do that? And apparently there

44:59.740 --> 45:05.540
is a process where they rate it and then they do a peer review process and then they re-rate

45:05.540 --> 45:10.980
it or some shit like that. I don't know, it's just, it's fishy and not to say that this

45:10.980 --> 45:15.540
game wouldn't have gotten, you know, high marks anyways, but it's still fishy and it's

45:15.540 --> 45:20.780
not a really good situation to be in, especially after the whole, you know, Kane and Lynch

45:20.780 --> 45:26.420
thing. Okay, and honestly, do people really give a shit? Oh, we rated it 9.5, but really

45:26.420 --> 45:32.080
it's a 10. We were off by 0.5. It's like, okay, it's a good game. We get what you're

45:32.080 --> 45:35.660
conveying with your ranking. It's just more crap that they can throw up in their advertising

45:35.660 --> 45:41.700
campaigns for it. It's been rated a 10 by IGN, you know, 10 out of 10 and they can throw

45:41.700 --> 45:46.940
that in their commercials and advertise that shit and it's just more like, you know, points

45:46.940 --> 45:54.380
for them, I guess. Okay. Alright, well, there's our thoughts on that and that's going to do

45:54.380 --> 45:58.140
it for the mailbag. If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. I'm going

45:58.140 --> 46:02.140
to tell you guys for future weeks, honestly, the more condensed you can make your emails,

46:02.140 --> 46:06.020
the better because, you know, our mailbag statement has been going kind of long lately,

46:06.020 --> 46:10.960
so we're going to have to start getting choosier. So, we do try to condense down big emails,

46:10.960 --> 46:16.220
but if you can do that, it makes it all the better. So, just so you know. If you want

46:16.220 --> 46:19.860
to go off for a longer period of time, there is always a Skype line. If you listen to us

46:19.860 --> 46:27.780
live Sunday nights on allgames.com. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki. Okay,

46:27.780 --> 46:34.180
well, there's a new card game coming out, not Eye of Judgment, but it's being released

46:34.180 --> 46:40.620
by EA. It's called Battle Forge, the collectible trading card game. It's coming out this fall

46:40.620 --> 46:45.660
and doesn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but they're comparing it to, of course,

46:45.660 --> 46:53.140
Magic the Gathering. It's a fantasy online real-time strategy game with collectible trading

46:53.140 --> 46:58.340
cards and says the game will release this fall, allow players to win, trade, and buy

46:58.340 --> 47:04.340
virtual cards to create the ultimate deck. So, it's like, I guess, Magic the Gathering

47:04.340 --> 47:10.460
online, but the way I see it, it's another way for EA to sell a lot of download content.

47:10.460 --> 47:16.060
That's really all it is. It's a download content whoring machine.

47:16.060 --> 47:21.820
Huh. Because you know developers these days love these things where they can just charge

47:21.820 --> 47:24.460
extra money for the expansions and all that stuff, huh?

47:24.460 --> 47:27.200
Exactly. You know, it's a collectible card game. What they're trying to do is they're

47:27.200 --> 47:33.820
trying to make a game that captures the fans of Magic the Gathering. It's going to be at

47:33.820 --> 47:38.980
the same level as Magic the Gathering and get people buying these card decks and stuff

47:38.980 --> 47:48.060
like that as much as possible. So, I don't know. I guess it's a good idea strategy-wise,

47:48.060 --> 47:50.780
but will people fall for it? I don't know.

47:50.780 --> 47:54.780
All right. Well, R-Type Command is coming out on May 6th. That's coming out on the PSP.

47:54.780 --> 47:59.060
It's R-Type the strategy game, which ought to be interesting. But what's kind of cool

47:59.060 --> 48:03.260
about this is that Atlus has actually announced that they are going to be putting out just

48:03.260 --> 48:07.260
for a limited time and just for those that buy the game from either GameStop, Amazon,

48:07.260 --> 48:11.900
GameCrazy, EB Games Canada, and some other specific retailers, they get to get a little

48:11.900 --> 48:16.980
free plastic miniature replica of the R9 spacecraft, which actually has that little pod thing in

48:16.980 --> 48:22.860
front and everything. So, if you're a game collector, specifically one that likes shmups,

48:22.860 --> 48:26.540
as they're called, then maybe you ought to think about getting this. Probably pre-orders

48:26.540 --> 48:29.500
only through some of these chains. So, take a look.

48:29.500 --> 48:36.420
Yeah. Another game coming out this fall as well on the DS, and probably a fan of Rob's

48:36.420 --> 48:43.940
here, Tech Mobile Kickoff will be landing on the DS. They haven't really said too many

48:43.940 --> 48:47.420
details on it yet, but here's what we do know. There's going to be a variety of teams with

48:47.420 --> 48:53.820
32 to choose from. There will be all new cut scenes showing off dramatic presentations

48:53.820 --> 48:59.320
of various plays, a customizable playbook, stylus control. Of course, it's going to have

48:59.320 --> 49:07.580
Wi-Fi and wireless multiplayer, customizable teams, and it's based on, of course, Tecmo,

49:07.580 --> 49:12.300
Super Bowl.

49:12.300 --> 49:17.640
Very nice. By the way, tonight we were going to be doing the match game, but unfortunately

49:17.640 --> 49:21.860
we didn't get around to it. Our resources were a little limited this week, so just a

49:21.860 --> 49:24.840
reminder, because this is the point where we were supposed to do match game, but we're

49:24.840 --> 49:28.780
tabling it to next week. Sorry kids. And that is, our contestants already picked. It's the

49:28.780 --> 49:33.220
toshin and footy showdown for the res code. And if one of them is not here, then we'll

49:33.220 --> 49:39.740
get somebody else. Because we're giving away that damn res code. It's going to happen next

49:39.740 --> 49:40.740
week.

49:40.740 --> 49:46.500
Yes. And another thing that's going to be happening relatively soon is a price drop

49:46.500 --> 49:52.020
for the Xbox 360 in Asia. In fact, different price drops are happening in different regions

49:52.020 --> 49:58.540
and all really odd percentages, but Hong Kong's getting an 11% price drop. Singapore, a 20%

49:58.540 --> 50:11.060
price drop. Also, South Korea, a 5.1% price drop. And Taiwan, a 17% price drop. So, it's

50:11.060 --> 50:15.980
very interesting. And I guess those price drops have already happened. They happened

50:15.980 --> 50:19.380
earlier than last week, so.

50:19.380 --> 50:23.620
Hooray for price drops. That makes some people very happy. Hey kids, we're going to be opening

50:23.620 --> 50:28.100
up the Skype line very soon if you want to give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username

50:28.100 --> 50:32.980
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but first we have a couple more quick stories for you guys.

50:32.980 --> 50:37.960
One of them is the Famicom Mobile, or I'm sorry, the FC Mobile. I probably should say

50:37.960 --> 50:41.380
it the other way because, you know, that would be a complete rip off of the name. But I guess,

50:41.380 --> 50:47.020
I mean, it seems like the patent on Nintendo's thing has expired or something because all

50:47.020 --> 50:51.860
these Nintendo knockoffs have been coming out lately. And now one of them is a mobile

50:51.860 --> 50:56.500
system that will actually, not mobile phones, but a mobile system that will actually play

50:56.500 --> 51:01.220
Nintendo games on the go. It can actually take the old Nintendo cartridges. It has a

51:01.220 --> 51:06.300
2.4 inch color LCD screen. It runs on three AA batteries. It's got speakers, a place to

51:06.300 --> 51:10.580
plug in headphones. You can plug the unit into the TV and play the NES games on the

51:10.580 --> 51:16.620
TV. And it's being sold, I guess, overseas, but it only plays American NES games. You

51:16.620 --> 51:22.380
can find them on eBay for 40 to 50 bucks. And that's because the patent expired for

51:22.380 --> 51:27.180
the original NES, which makes me think in a couple of years the patent is going to expire

51:27.180 --> 51:30.980
on the Super Nintendo, right? We're going to start seeing more and more of these as

51:30.980 --> 51:36.300
years go on. Pretty soon, every CD player will have a PlayStation 1 in it. When that

51:36.300 --> 51:42.340
patent expires, that's going to be interesting. We'll see. Unless they renew the patent, in

51:42.340 --> 51:50.520
which case, then, uh oh. Now this is interesting. This is almost like seeing a unicorn, I guess.

51:50.520 --> 51:58.540
But apparently, Shacknews website has actually seen Duke Nukem Forever, the game, in reality.

51:58.540 --> 52:02.900
They've actually seen the real game being played. And apparently, I guess, Shacknews

52:02.900 --> 52:12.900
is very close to 3D Realms offices. And they were shown about half an hour of footage from

52:12.900 --> 52:20.860
the game, I guess, gameplay, including some environmental puzzles, interactivity, a host

52:20.860 --> 52:26.580
of finished weapons, an existence of an in-game forklift, and plenty of heads and armor.

52:26.580 --> 52:36.180
Oh my god, a forklift? Yes. What the fork? Let's see, it says, apparently, 3D Realms,

52:36.180 --> 52:42.140
George Broussard, the developer, said, out of the blue, I just decided to show them Duke

52:42.140 --> 52:47.100
Nukem Forever for about an hour. Well, I would like to see Duke Nukem Forever for about an

52:47.100 --> 52:52.740
hour, and I'm sure a lot of other people would, too. I don't know, how about an idea? How

52:52.740 --> 52:56.500
about you show the world Duke Nukem Forever for about an hour? How about you show them

52:56.500 --> 53:07.460
for like two minutes? Is that so much to ask? Seriously. Wow. Do you think it's really,

53:07.460 --> 53:13.020
really gonna come out? I think it will, but I think it'll underwhelm everybody. I guess

53:13.020 --> 53:17.060
it's kind of like Prey. Even though I enjoyed Prey, it was kind of underwhelming to a lot

53:17.060 --> 53:20.420
of people because there was so much that went into it, you know what I mean? Like, so much

53:20.420 --> 53:24.620
hype and everything that went into it. And then I guess it kind of disappointed. And

53:24.620 --> 53:28.660
the thing about Prey, it ended like that. The ending was just kind of out of the middle

53:28.660 --> 53:33.220
of nowhere. It was kind of weird. I hear there's a sequel being planned, though, so we'll see

53:33.220 --> 53:37.020
what happens with that. Alright, we're gonna open up the Skype line, finally. If you want

53:37.020 --> 53:45.260
to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

53:45.260 --> 53:49.740
You can always find out more about the Skype line and how it works if you go to www.orangeloungeradio.com

53:49.740 --> 53:54.700
and click on interact with us. That gives you the whole spiel about how the Skype line

53:54.700 --> 54:00.100
works. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? I got balls

54:00.100 --> 54:05.980
of steel. Oh, I'm sorry, you're a little quiet. What's that, sir? I got balls of steel. You

54:05.980 --> 54:12.300
have balls of steel. This is DJ Dark Knight. Hey, what's up, DJ Dark Knight? Oh, I see,

54:12.300 --> 54:17.940
you're getting a little happy about the news about Duke Nukem Forever. No, just basically

54:17.940 --> 54:21.900
doing the running gag of jokes everybody else has posted about the balls of steel thing.

54:21.900 --> 54:28.300
Whoa, the audio quality on this call is no bueno. Something's going on there. Dark Knight,

54:28.300 --> 54:32.500
your call quality is like really staticky and it's probably gonna drive our podcast

54:32.500 --> 54:36.180
listeners nuts. Hurry up and get... I'm gonna give you like 10 seconds to get your question

54:36.180 --> 54:42.740
out and then we're gonna have to let you go. Okay, just basically about the... I'm a little

54:42.740 --> 54:48.740
bit late to the show because I've basically been testing something else out. Mostly about

54:48.740 --> 54:54.820
the GTA 4 situation and whatnot and, I mean, how much longer do you think the man is gonna

54:54.820 --> 55:00.580
be before it finally dies off? How long what is gonna be before it dies off? The whole...

55:00.580 --> 55:03.940
Oh, the demand is gonna be before it dies off. All right, we'll answer your question,

55:03.940 --> 55:07.220
Dark Knight. Take care, buddy. How long do you think it is gonna be before the demand

55:07.220 --> 55:10.220
dies off? Well, look at all the other games that have come out. They've been selling well

55:10.220 --> 55:16.700
for years. Hell, Granth of the Auto, San Andreas still sells really well. So, a while.

55:16.700 --> 55:20.220
It's gonna keep selling through Christmas. Here's why, because not everybody's up to

55:20.220 --> 55:24.500
the HDH. Here's the thing, there's this whole domino effect going on. This is why Granth

55:24.500 --> 55:28.580
of the Auto 4 is gonna stay out there. It's because of the domino effect. By February

55:28.580 --> 55:34.060
of 2009, lots of people are gonna have to buy new TVs. Actually, they only have to buy

55:34.060 --> 55:38.300
digital converters for their TVs. And keep in mind, this is, I believe, America only.

55:38.300 --> 55:42.220
I'm not sure if Canada's affected by this or other countries, but at least in America,

55:42.220 --> 55:47.780
they have passed this thing where all television will be digital signals by February of 2009.

55:47.780 --> 55:52.100
So, you have to get this digital converter for your television. But what's happening

55:52.100 --> 55:55.480
is most people are getting scared. Like, they don't understand it. So, most people are just

55:55.480 --> 55:59.660
using it to buy a new TV that has digital in it. And a lot of people, especially when

55:59.660 --> 56:04.120
you start talking about tax rebates, the stimulus coming up and everything, they're just going

56:04.120 --> 56:09.340
up to HDTV. Why not? And I think you're gonna see HDTVs a lot throughout the year for birthdays

56:09.340 --> 56:13.900
and Christmas. And here's the domino effect. As people get HDTVs, then they're gonna start

56:13.900 --> 56:18.460
buying Xbox 360s and PlayStation 3s because they're gonna wanna play Blu-ray movies on

56:18.460 --> 56:23.960
these TVs. This is why I believe the Xbox 360 and Blu-ray thing may be true. They're

56:23.960 --> 56:28.220
gonna wanna get that out there by Christmas because they wanna get a part of this domino

56:28.220 --> 56:33.100
effect because they get the high-def TVs, then they're gonna buy the Blu-ray players,

56:33.100 --> 56:36.300
and then, of course, you wanna buy games that you play on these systems. Grand Theft Auto

56:36.300 --> 56:39.500
has a lot of name recognition. This thing will continue to sell through Christmas for

56:39.500 --> 56:40.900
that reason. Agree?

56:40.900 --> 56:41.900
Yes.

56:41.900 --> 56:42.900
Yep.

56:42.900 --> 56:47.140
All right. Good. You should always agree with me. All right. If you wanna give us a call,

56:47.140 --> 56:52.180
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio. While we wait for some calls,

56:52.180 --> 56:54.020
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

56:54.020 --> 56:59.660
Yes. Resistance Fall of Man 2 is gonna be playable at the PlayStation Day, which is

56:59.660 --> 57:06.180
coming out on Tuesday, May 6th. So, I'm sure we're gonna see a lot of press releases coming

57:06.180 --> 57:11.300
out of that, probably pretty soon. Something else also kinda tying in with PlayStation

57:11.300 --> 57:18.740
Day. MotorStorm 2 has had a name change. Now it's being renamed MotorStorm Pacific Rift.

57:18.740 --> 57:23.620
So, meaning it's MotorStorm 1 reskinned. Hi, caller, are you there? Who's this?

57:23.620 --> 57:24.620
This is Spazinator.

57:24.620 --> 57:25.620
I'm sorry?

57:25.620 --> 57:26.620
Spazinator.

57:26.620 --> 57:27.620
Spell that for me?

57:27.620 --> 57:34.620
Yeah. The screen name I usually go by is Spazinator.

57:34.620 --> 57:38.300
All right. Well, what's your question? What's on your mind, buddy?

57:38.300 --> 57:46.420
Yeah. I was wondering, now that GTA 4 is out, do you think we're gonna be hearing from the

57:46.420 --> 57:53.100
lawyer that we shall not name? We're gonna see you know where those lawsuits coming out

57:53.100 --> 57:54.100
of the world work?

57:54.100 --> 57:58.100
Absolutely, dude. We already have. He tried to get the sales of the game stopped. Here's

57:58.100 --> 58:03.900
the thing. He's waiting. This is what this man is. He's a leech. And what's gonna happen

58:03.900 --> 58:09.620
is the first time some poor, innocent kid gets killed by their cousin who's fucked in

58:09.620 --> 58:14.820
the head after playing Grand Theft Auto 4, this leech is gonna leech right onto that

58:14.820 --> 58:19.180
story and pin it on Grand Theft Auto and try to sue the makers and try to get the game

58:19.180 --> 58:23.260
pulled from shelves. And heaven forbid if there's any hidden things this time around,

58:23.260 --> 58:27.820
although I'm sure Take-Two took extra, extra precaution to Rockstar. They all took extra,

58:27.820 --> 58:31.620
extra precaution to make sure there is nothing hidden on that disc.

58:31.620 --> 58:39.980
Yeah. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there something mentioned maybe a few months

58:39.980 --> 58:46.220
ago? You know, someone here, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but some kind of injunction

58:46.220 --> 58:52.580
or something on this guy, you know, saying that, you know, he can't sue anyone or fucking

58:52.580 --> 58:53.580
through that far?

58:53.580 --> 58:56.660
I want to say Take-Two complained about him in the court, or wasn't it?

58:56.660 --> 59:00.700
No, he's been, he's been, um, basically he has to get someone else to sign off on any

59:00.700 --> 59:01.700
lawsuit that he does.

59:01.700 --> 59:02.700
Oh, that was it, yeah.

59:02.700 --> 59:04.380
But no, there is still right now a current-

59:04.380 --> 59:05.380
But only in Florida, right?

59:05.380 --> 59:06.380
No.

59:06.380 --> 59:07.380
Was it? Oh.

59:07.380 --> 59:08.380
Anywhere.

59:08.380 --> 59:09.380
Wow.

59:09.380 --> 59:10.380
Yeah.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.380
Yeah.

59:11.380 --> 59:30.100
I was going to say, one more thing, uh, before I let you guys get going to the next caller.

59:30.100 --> 59:35.540
Um, you know, this may be just me, but I think we should probably promote this game as much

59:35.540 --> 59:40.340
as possible, and give people the, buy this game as much as possible, just annoy the,

59:40.340 --> 59:43.820
you know, what, as, as this lawyer, along with Hillary Clinton.

59:43.820 --> 59:49.660
I mean, the more people these guys get, you know, at least in my book, the better, right?

59:49.660 --> 59:54.180
What we really have to do, here's the strategy, is that, I mean, yeah, there's one way to

59:54.180 --> 59:58.340
do it, but what we really have to try and do is not give this guy any credit.

59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.300
We need to stop covering every little move he makes.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.460
I mean, and I've used this comparison on the show before a while ago, but I haven't said

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.380
it in a while, he's the village idiot in our minds.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:11.980
Every time this guy does something, we publish it, look what the village idiot did today,

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:17.100
you know, look at the lawsuit he filed today, you know, we need to stop giving him attention.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:21.900
It's just like, you know, I don't know about you or any of our listeners or you guys, but

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.520
when I was getting bullied in school, it's happened to all of us, don't laugh Rice Princess,

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.020
but when I was getting bullied in school, my mom always said, don't pay attention to

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.420
them and they'll stop.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.020
And to a certain extent, she was kind of right, the more you pay attention to these types

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.460
of things, they go away because they're there to ruffle feathers, it's what they do.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.740
Yeah, you definitely get a point there.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.740
All right.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.220
Well, hey, we appreciate the call, do you have any last quick thoughts before we jump

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.220
to another call?

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.620
No, I think that pretty much covers it, thanks for taking my call.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.820
No problemo, have a good night.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.340
Bye, you too.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.380
I like hearing from people we don't hear from too often.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.580
Yeah, thanks for calling.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.620
All right, yes, we appreciate that.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.900
All right, more calls.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:04.900
Now the phone's ringing off the hook.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.620
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry, who's this?

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.260
Hey, hey, it's Ronma.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:12.660
Ronma, I noticed the comment you just made in chat, bullshit, even if you do ignore bullies,

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.380
they will keep at it.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:21.540
My problem was I got bullied in school, I ignored them, it kept going to the point where

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.260
I actually had to throw my fists up and get to a few fistfights.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:33.020
I know, I realize that times have also changed from when I was a kid.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:38.660
But I don't know, it's just, I always kind of think a lot of people do things for attention

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:43.420
and obviously there's extremes in every circumstance where people are just fucked in the head,

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.980
but a lot of times people do things for attention, if you don't give them attention, it'll go

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.020
away.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:52.620
But there are people that just are sick, I don't know what else to say.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.620
Let's talk about happier things.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.900
So what did you call in to call in about tonight?

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.660
Talk more about Mario Kart Wii.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.660
Wii!

01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:59.900
Why aren't you on my friends list yet?

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.900
I added you.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:05.740
Well, when you posted your code, I was away for Sakura Matsuri at a friend's house when

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.740
we got home.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.580
We were playing Mario Kart Wii until about 5 o'clock in the morning.

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.940
You're not having that much fun with it, eh?

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.260
Yeah, I'm playing on the Classic Controller, everybody else is playing on GameCube Controllers.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.140
I can't play on the Cube Controller so well, but I can rock on the Classic Controller without

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.140
any problems.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.140
Wiimote Nunchuck for me.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.140
I find controlling is easier on that.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.140
Wiimote Nunchuck for me.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.980
I tried it for a while, but I found I just couldn't get the controller with the thumb

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980
tool.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.140
I was like losing it, but it's like more natural with the Classic Controller.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:37.460
I keep thinking of Super Mario Kart.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.740
Do you think this is the best Mario Kart yet, or do you think it's somewhere in the middle,

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.740
or worse?

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:46.840
It's somewhere in the middle, because I really dig Mario Kart DS more.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.780
But it's that, you know how they say they remove snaking and so forth?

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.940
If you do it right, you can still do it.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:57.660
I just find it easier to do quote-unquote snaking and power boosting with the control

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.500
stick than I could with the control pad.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.700
You know what's interesting though, is I find online, it doesn't seem like people are cheating

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:09.820
as much, because you have a lot of people on there that are playing with the wheel,

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.820
for one.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.820
I noticed that.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.820
There's tons of people online.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.820
Yeah, a lot of people on the wheel.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.380
And you know, it just seems like there's less cheating going on.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.520
The only cheating in the game, and something I really should have mentioned in part A when

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.980
I review the game, here's the irritation I have with the game.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.060
The items, I realize is a part of Mario Kart, it's got to be there.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.460
It's a little much.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.940
They really needed to scale back, and I think part of that might have to do with them expanding

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.380
it from like 8 to 12 cars at once.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.020
There is just too many freaking blue shells that show up, you know what I mean?

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.020
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.020
A little much.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.860
You ought to be able to turn some of that shit off when playing online.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.860
Not yet, no.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.860
Can you turn items off?

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:45.860
You can turn items off.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:46.860
Oh, nice.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.460
Well, all together, but you can't single one out.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.300
Yeah, it'll be nice if they give you a little more customization when you just turn off

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.300
blue shells.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.300
They have it where you can do like, you know, the powerful items will appear less, will

01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.740
appear more, appear normal, but to be honest, playing through each different mode, I have

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.980
not noticed a difference.

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:10.900
Well, I have noticed that when you're in first place with probably Mario Kart games, all

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.500
you had at your disposal were banana peels and green turtle shells.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:20.140
I've noticed now you're getting more powerful items like red turtle shells and other items

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:21.140
too, you know?

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:25.520
Once in a blue moon you get a red turtle shell, but you never get a bullet and you never get

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520
a blue shell.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.520
Well, obviously.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.260
But I've gotten a lot of red shells being in first place, but I've also noticed that

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:35.940
when I'm in first place, a shitload of shells just hit me out of nowhere.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:41.860
Sometimes the best strategy online, honestly, is to stay in second and hang onto a golden

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.780
mushroom for the end if you can get one.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.180
Have you checked out the Super NES tracks on the game yet?

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.660
Um, yeah, like I, well, I'm only a little bit through, like I played all the new tracks

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.700
and now I'm working my way through the bot, I'm only on 50cc, okay, because I was playing

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.900
online for a long time, but I did play the Ghost Valley is in the first set and that

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:00.900
was pretty cool.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:06.100
Yeah, I just love how they brought back the original power boosters and not a remix theme,

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:10.260
the original themes, that's, I was really enjoying that.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.100
It seems like they've still been slightly retouched, but they're, it's still, it's quality.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.260
It's not, you know, they didn't ruin them.

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.940
Now, Sky, before I go, let me ask you to see if you agree with me.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.740
With the Wiimote and Nunchuck controller, do you think it should have been more natural

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.700
to use the Wiimote when you shake it to throw an item instead of doing tricks?

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.340
No, because I think it might be too sensitive and sometimes, you know, you get a little

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.740
excited, you kind of move around, you hop around, especially if you're getting in the

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.740
heat of it.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.540
You just have a bad feeling that it would, and I sit kind of far away from the TV, so

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.380
when I'm playing, the sensitivity is kind of, or, you know, if I'm trying to like point

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.380
at the screen, it's really hard.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.180
I've got to lean forward to get at the screen.

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.500
I just have a bad feeling it would screw things up.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.640
Probably with all the precautions they tell you, I think it'd just be more fun, you know,

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.120
to shake the Wiimote to throw the item.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.660
But then again, some of us are a little bit too heavy-handed and we'll send it flying

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:10.420
across the room, and we just got a new 32-inch HDTV, and if that happens, somebody's getting

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.420
their neck snapped.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.420
I'll meet you halfway.

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.700
They ought to add custom controls where you can assign whatever you want.

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.700
Agreed.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:17.700
All right.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:23.460
Rama, thanks so much for the call, and really quickly, OLRCon, what's up with this?

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.180
Is there a big meeting happening somewhere here that we need to go to?

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.180
Do we need to rent out the Elk's Lodge for a night?

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.900
It's pretty much my return to the West Coast like you wanted me to.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.900
All right.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.220
What's that?

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.820
It's my return to the West Coast like everybody wanted me to.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.140
And he said, well, we've got to figure out where we're getting together and have an

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.140
apartheid.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.900
Well, I do know, I am crashing on Doc Sakura's couch for three days, which would be pretty

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.100
awesome, and I will be bringing some stuff.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.240
And I'll probably bring some New York City trinkets as well.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.580
It's Fourth of July weekend?

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.580
Mm-hmm.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.700
You know, if it wasn't summer, I'd say let's have a late birthday party for me at Roseville

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.620
Golf Land, but it's summer and that's going to suck.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.860
Well, we can kind of make an agreement.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.540
My birthday's past, too, maybe we could do something like that together.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.700
We'll figure something out.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.020
All right, we'll talk more about it offline.

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.020
The listeners don't want to hear about it.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.020
All right.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.020
Take care, buddy.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.020
You, too.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.020
All right.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.020
Bye.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.020
Bye.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.980
But if you're in Northern California, specifically the Sacramento area, you might want to stay

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.140
tuned the next few episodes because we're going to do something.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.300
I know we have some listeners in the SAC area.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.940
Loki, quickly, any other last minute stories?

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.940
Yes.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.540
Let's see here.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:34.580
The ESRB has added some more Xbox Live Arcade games to their list of stuff coming out, including

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:45.700
Samurai Showdown 2, of course, Red Baron for the arcade, Red Baron arcade, which is interesting,

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:49.580
and the Revenge of the Plague Lord, but we knew that was coming.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.420
That was for Puzzle Quest, the expansion.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.420
Let's see.

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.260
This is an interesting turn for download content for Rock Band.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:06.380
Apparently, Best Buy is running an offer where if you pre-order Disturb's new album, you

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:15.180
actually will get a code for two free downloadable Rock Band tracks for the actual album, including

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:25.380
Indestructible, which is the cover track for that, and Inside the Fire.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:33.500
That's kind of interesting, and then, let's see here, Guitar Hero 3 this week will be

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:41.920
getting three songs from Muse, including, let's see, Exopolitics, Supermassive, Black

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:51.020
Hole, and Stockholm Syndrome, and they're going to cost 500 Microsoft points, and one

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.360
other thing we talked a little bit about earlier with the Virtual Console and people hacking

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360
it.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.980
Now, they've already hacked and pirated WiiWare games, and they have actually brought over

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:07.340
some of the Japanese WiiWare games to the North American Virtual Console.

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.300
You can actually find those online if you're into that kind of thing, but I just think

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:21.500
it's funny how quickly they've hacked those apart already.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.220
And that's pretty much it.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:30.900
Oh, and a rumor of a Blu-ray console coming to the market, or a Blu-ray-included 360 coming

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.220
to the market in third quarter, although I don't believe that, but we'll see.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.100
You know, I was listening to Bobby show a little bit, and he made a pretty good argument

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.400
for why it is happening, and plus, I think what I said earlier about the whole domino

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.740
effect, I think it's damn well possible something like that's going to happen.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.160
It's just a matter of time.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.740
I think it's just going to be hard with alienating their customers, but if they only use it for

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.980
video playback, then that's fine.

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.660
As long as they don't start coming out with Blu-ray games, I absolutely agree with you

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.660
there.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.020
I absolutely agree with you there.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.020
Let's go to the phones.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.020
Who's this?

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.020
Who's PT?

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.580
Hey, Dark Dead Tsuya.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.580
What is on your mind, my friend?

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.580
I don't know.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.060
I was trying to get in, but it kept going to voicemail.

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:12.060
Yeah, well, we were letting Loki do some last minute stories for a little bit before we

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.060
opened it back up.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.060
What's on your mind?

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.060
Okay.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.060
Oh, sure.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.060
Ron?

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.060
Huh?

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.060
We're here.

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.060
What's up?

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:25.700
You might have to lower the speakers in your house because you're probably hearing feedback.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:26.700
Yeah.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.700
Oh, well, sorry.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.700
Yeah.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.700
Okay.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:30.700
I got it.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700
So, yeah.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:38.780
Rama has OLRCon, but I had OLR Central in October.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.300
We have competing conventions going on.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:47.740
Apparently, there's... Rama's OLRCon is happening in July, and then we have... Misty's coming

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.140
out here, right?

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.140
Yeah.

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.860
We have the Misty Dark Tetsuya OLR Central, or whatever they're calling it, happening

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.860
in October.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.860
And none of which I've heard of.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.860
So, it's awesome.

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.260
No, I think they've talked about the October thing before.

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.260
Here's the deal, buddy.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.700
We'll make time.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.580
The year is a long time.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.500
Definitely, we want to meet Misty.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.960
Definitely, we want to entertain Rama while he's here.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.140
You know what?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.220
If other strangers from the internet want to fly out here, why not?

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.220
Come on over.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.900
We'll have a party.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.620
My roommate's probably going to kill me for saying that.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.620
Good idea.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.620
He loves that idea.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.620
But, you know, whatever.

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.300
We'll make time for it all.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.300
I'm not worried about it.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.540
And then somebody's going to say, let's do OLR Expo in August.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.580
Yes, there totally are.

01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.580
It is all good.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.580
We will have fun.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.540
You know, in October is enough time to cool down from July, from all the partying we're

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.540
going to do with Rama's here.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.500
We'll be good to go again for some Olive Garden, Home of the Never Ending Breadsticks, and

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.500
all of that.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.500
Yeah.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.500
All right.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500
Anything else on your mind?

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.500
Or an iron.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.500
Anything else on your mind, Dark Tetsuya?

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:53.500
I don't know, I was thinking about that portable Famicom thing.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.500
That sounded pretty cool.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.500
Yeah, I know.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.980
You know, it's not too bad, $40 or $50, considering it's portable and everything, and what an

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.980
awesome piece of retro.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.940
I'm going to have to ask Jamie if she's going to pick up one of those.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:03.940
I hear it just plays Nintendo.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.940
Oh, sorry.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.940
Yeah, and you know.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.140
I hear it just plays Nintendo games.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.140
It does.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:10.140
It does.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.140
It doesn't play any of the other stuff.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.580
But, you know, I was thinking, well, where would you actually be able to get Nintendo

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.580
games?

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.900
Because, you know, everybody stopped carrying them a long time ago.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:20.100
Like, flea markets and garage sales, you can pick shit up for, like, 50 cents a month.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.460
Game cra- or, not game crazies, but, uh, playing trades, I think, still carry Nintendo.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.260
Okay, like, there's one of those stores in the Sacramento region.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.660
You've got to think bigger, big stores.

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:30.660
They're a chain.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.660
Oh, yeah.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.660
There's, like, there's, like, 300 stores.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:33.660
What?

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.660
In the U.S.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:35.660
I thought there was only one of them here.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.660
No.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.660
Oh, funny.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.660
Okay, my bad.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:43.060
No, um, and then there's also, uh, well, locally, we've got a record store, um, Dimple.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.640
They carry NES games.

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.640
You know, when I-

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:52.220
When I was in New York City for, uh, NYOLRCon, when I was there, um, last year, we actually

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.980
all went to a video game store, and, uh, they had old Nintendo games.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.300
I remember because I found a copy of the Guardian Legend, which I bought for my friend who let

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.940
me stay at her place in New York City.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.220
She lives in Brooklyn, and she has an old school Nintendo, and I bought it for her,

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.100
and I said, Amanda, that's her name, Amanda, I said, Amanda, this is the best video game

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.300
of all time.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.460
You need to treasure this game.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.540
I don't think the bitch has played it yet.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.580
She's too busy with WoW.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:21.380
Cause Irene, I know Irene called her and was like, Amanda, Karazhan, even though I don't

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.460
think Irene's ever talked to her, but anyway, Video Games New York was the name of the store

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:30.460
according to Rama, so, alright, DT, any other thoughts for our listeners before we let you

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.460
go?

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:35.420
Oh, well, I just hope, uh, Granny Sue comes out in the US.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.420
What?

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.420
Two comes out in the US?

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:38.420
Granny Sue.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.420
Ooh, I hope so too.

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.300
I, you know what, I think the odds of seeing that are much more than Choaniki here in the

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.300
US.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.300
Oh God, yeah.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.700
Alright, DT, take care, have a good week, okay?

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.700
And we'll see you in October.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:50.700
Yeah, you too.

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.700
Alright.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700
See you later.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.700
Bye bye.

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.700
Although you should really come to the July one too, if you can.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.700
You should come to both.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.380
Alright, this is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:03.740
We're gonna go ahead and start to close out the show, cause it's getting late.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.940
Considering it was a slow news week, we did a good job filling up three hours.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.660
I'm quite proud of the cast tonight.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:11.660
Alright, so, uh, we gotta go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.740
Loki, do you have a final thought?

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.580
More Grand Theft Auto 4 this week.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.420
Rice Princess, thank you for being here this week.

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.140
Appreciate you being here as always.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.940
And by the way, thank you so much for stealing the mushroom that, um, Eddie the Gay.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.360
Uh, no, he, okay, he had four of them.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.100
He gave one to me and three to you.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.220
You didn't take- I've totally forgot today.

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:32.220
I'm gonna get them though.

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.220
Then that's your own damn call.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.220
For the studio.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.220
And a question mark block.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.220
Yeah, oh, you should hang it too.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.220
I'm, we're getting it.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220
We're gonna hang the question mark block for the ceiling.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.140
I'm gonna put a tack and hang the question mark block and then we'll put the mushrooms

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.140
around.

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.740
And then we can put, like, Cartman and some of these other things they see on Justin TV,

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.060
uh, on the mushrooms.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.140
But first we have to fix Justin TV by actually wiring the Mac in because the, the feed on

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.580
Justin TV sucks right now, so we gotta fix that.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:56.040
By the way, speaking of Justin TV, real quick, did you hear about some of our, um, uh, friends

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.260
over on Justin TV got their stream shut down?

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.340
Take Two put the smack down just for a day.

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.500
They only got a 24 hour ban.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:05.180
They got some archives deleted, but apparently there was a big crackdown from Take Two on

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.700
people broadcasting Grand Theft Auto 4 and, like, All Games was one of them that got their,

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.820
some of their archives deleted and, cause they were showing the game, you know, they're

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.140
broadcasting the game for, like, two days.

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:18.780
And Take Two did not like that, even though it's free publicity, I guess they just didn't

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780
like that.

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780
That's ridiculous.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.740
Cause they weren't one of the approved media outlets probably.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.740
Wow.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.900
Cause you know those people have the exclusives.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:27.900
We had to hide our footage.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.900
Our footage is still there.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.900
We had to hide it.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.900
But we only did, like, ten minutes.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.900
And it was like-

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.140
And if they had shut us down for ten, I would have thrown a fit because, like, IGN and these

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.940
other sites probably have way more than ten minutes worth of video.

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.300
They're all on YouTube now, too, so it's retarded.

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.900
Although ShadowNextGen in chat says a bunch of YouTube videos were deleted, too.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.020
That's just stupid.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.540
Free publicity for your game.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.540
But see, they're just bullies.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:51.660
You know, I would say we should boycott them, but who's gonna fucking boycott Grand Theft

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.660
Auto 4?

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.660
We should ignore them, Rob.

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.660
Let's stop talking about it right now.

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.660
Well, that's fine.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.660
I'll boycott their other smaller games.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:57.660
Good idea.

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:58.660
You know, they've got the 2K series.

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.460
Well, I don't like sports, so that's fine.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.940
They've got their stupid, what, tennis game, their Rockstar's Table Tennis.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:08.260
Fuck your table tennis in the ass.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.020
I ain't playing that shit.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:16.640
And then they've got, well, they've got Dora the Explorer, which is shit.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:23.060
They've also got, well, they've got Mafia, which is coming out, and Noir, but, you know,

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:28.620
when the fuck are those gonna come out, like, forever, you know, from now?

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.620
That's fine.

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620
All I buy is Grand Theft Auto.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.620
That's fine.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.620
All right.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.380
Any final thoughts from you, Rice Princess?

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.780
Thank you for being here tonight and giving us a female perspective when DarkSakura was

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780
unable to.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780
You're welcome.

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780
All right.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780
Any final thoughts?

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.420
I'm gonna get myself a banana.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.140
No one gets that.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.440
That's all right.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.140
My final thought is, actually, a fruit salad sounds pretty yummy right now.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.140
Yummy, yummy.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.140
Yummy, yummy.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.140
Yeah, I know.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.140
I don't get that.

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.140
All right.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.140
That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundredo.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.820
If you're here, here on Orange Laundredo, please tell two friends about our show.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:02.820
Tell two enemies about our show.

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:03.820
I don't care.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.460
Just tell two people about our show, because that's how word of mouth spreads, and more

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:13.020
people everywhere find out about Orange Lounge Radio, and without you and your support, independent

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.020
radio would be dead.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.100
But thanks to you, it's still alive.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.060
You know, I heard that, because I've given out our cards during the Zappos.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:23.140
I was, like, just about to play the outgoing music, but what, what, Loki?

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:26.900
I was hitting on our cards at the Zappos thing, and they're gonna put it on their little blog

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.900
site.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:28.900
Really?

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.900
How nice of them.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.900
Awesome.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:31.900
All right.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.900
Cool.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900
We're getting out there a little more.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900
Woohoo, woohoo.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.900
All right.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900
That's gonna do it for another week of Orange Laundredo.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.980
Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.900
She's not Dark Sakura, but she will be next week, and he's Loki, and Rice Princess helped,

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:44.900
and we're Orange Laundredo.

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:45.900
Have a good week.

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.900
