02:02.600 --> 02:07.200
mustard all over me yes mustard what in the hell this show is completely

02:07.200 --> 02:11.400
disorganized tonight what you delicious mustard I don't know first the mics are

02:11.400 --> 02:14.240
tangled in the problem is because she's sitting over here instead of sitting

02:14.240 --> 02:19.120
over in Jamie's like abyss over there so well because of that I have to move this

02:19.120 --> 02:22.200
stupid thing around the chair I want to get her scoot back we want to get her

02:22.200 --> 02:25.880
pretty little face on cam even though the cam is kind of sucking tonight sorry

02:25.880 --> 02:30.400
there all right how you doing I'm fine all right now except that mustard on me

02:30.400 --> 02:38.800
how was your week outside of the goddamn mustard it was okay I went to Vegas how

02:38.800 --> 02:43.480
was Vegas you went there for some type of like gaming demo or something right

02:43.480 --> 02:48.840
yeah we went there too I don't know what you would really call I guess the gaming

02:48.840 --> 02:56.400
expo we were the expo what's a Zappos you may remember them of the shoes and

02:56.400 --> 03:01.400
apparel website they have like commercials now on TV and stuff so we

03:01.400 --> 03:05.560
went there we got the tour and then we demoed games there which I got to play

03:05.560 --> 03:11.080
you know quite a few of them because that's what I was doing is playing games

03:11.080 --> 03:15.600
and basically you know just kind of teaching them the basics about games and

03:15.600 --> 03:19.400
stuff just throwing some like facts out there for him basically just to get him

03:19.400 --> 03:24.920
excited about games it was cool though they had a DDR supernova machine there

03:24.920 --> 03:32.400
so I got to play that for a little bit and then what else did we play there we

03:32.400 --> 03:37.080
had a Gran Turismo 5 prologue setup which I mean that game looks good but

03:37.080 --> 03:40.220
you know I just never was really interested in the Gran Turismo series

03:40.220 --> 03:45.080
but pretty I'll give them that and got to use the nice dual shocks and stuff so

03:45.080 --> 03:54.240
all the rumbles which you know I guess that's neat then we also had set up

03:54.240 --> 03:59.840
Mario Kart Wii so I finally used the Wii wheel instead of just you know

03:59.840 --> 04:04.240
hooking it out the door be honest there's really hardly any difference

04:04.240 --> 04:08.240
between the Wii wheel and just holding the controller sideways and I hate it I

04:08.240 --> 04:13.840
absolutely hate it but we played you know that for a while and then I tried

04:13.840 --> 04:17.200
also they had a well Halo 3 set up so I was playing a little bit of a death

04:17.200 --> 04:22.200
match there that was fun Call of Duty 4 which I've played that before and that

04:22.200 --> 04:27.480
looks nice we had Grand Theft Auto 4 set up because I brought my copy actually

04:27.480 --> 04:31.040
with me I actually brought my 360 with me ironically enough that I didn't get

04:31.040 --> 04:36.120
chance to actually play it in my hotel room at all so that kind of sucked but I

04:36.120 --> 04:39.520
did play it at the event and I had already memorized a lot of the cheat

04:39.520 --> 04:43.280
codes so I was just spawning helicopters and chopping people with the rotor

04:43.280 --> 04:47.040
blades and stuff and just fun stuff like that and people seem to enjoy it then we

04:47.040 --> 04:51.400
had Wii Sports being demoed you know pretty much everything from that and

04:51.400 --> 04:56.280
Smash Brothers once again I had to play with it you know the controller sideways

04:56.280 --> 05:02.520
which I hate it and I think that's it so that's what we were demoing for them and

05:02.520 --> 05:06.360
they really enjoyed it and it's a great company to be honest I'd work there

05:06.360 --> 05:10.840
tomorrow if I could but you know they're all the way in Henderson Nevada and we're

05:10.840 --> 05:17.160
all the way out here in Sacramento but shit man if they were out here absolutely

05:17.160 --> 05:21.040
awesome company just everyone loved working there they cater lunch and

05:21.040 --> 05:26.360
breakfast every day they have vending machines full of stuff that's all free

05:26.360 --> 05:33.520
just very fun going you know environment well since you were getting into your

05:33.520 --> 05:36.120
gaming week why don't you tell us a little more about what other types of

05:36.120 --> 05:39.480
games you've been playing this week anything outside of Vegas yes well more

05:39.480 --> 05:43.840
Grand Theft Auto 4 we finally got our internet open at work so now we can

05:43.840 --> 05:47.520
start doing the death matches online which is awesome very looking forward to

05:47.520 --> 05:51.400
that I played a five minute death match with one of my co-workers and it was fun

05:51.400 --> 05:55.240
it's pretty hard to spot people especially even with all the

05:55.240 --> 05:58.560
pedestrians raining around because you know you do see their name above their

05:58.560 --> 06:02.400
head and stuff but sometimes it's hard to spot on me amongst all the pedestrians

06:02.400 --> 06:06.120
so that's pretty cool and then today we just kind of play the like a fuck-off

06:06.120 --> 06:10.760
game you know it's a free play thing and that was fun it played that for about I

06:10.760 --> 06:15.840
think a good half hour 45 minutes and just you know flying around helicopters

06:15.840 --> 06:20.400
and just you know fucking around running for the police it was really fun it

06:20.400 --> 06:25.800
really I really want to get more into the multiplayer in this game that's for

06:25.800 --> 06:30.040
sure in the single-player version of the game is pretty fun too I've been doing

06:30.040 --> 06:34.320
more of the missions and stuff and kind of along in the stories starting to you

06:34.320 --> 06:40.040
know come around a bit so I'm very you know looking forward to this game a lot

06:40.040 --> 06:43.760
I'm just worried though that because even like flying to the different

06:43.760 --> 06:48.240
islands and stuff it's like okay now I've seen everything and you know I

06:48.240 --> 06:52.680
don't know but I think it's still very confusing stuff driving around you don't

06:52.680 --> 06:57.080
you know it's hard to orient yourself a little bit more than say the other games

06:57.080 --> 07:02.000
because there's a lot less than those other games but it's a good game

07:02.000 --> 07:05.880
definitely a good game and see what else they play Oh crisis core played that a

07:05.880 --> 07:11.320
little bit on the plane I really can't get in that game very much it's too

07:11.320 --> 07:16.080
linear just really because people have just been like you know swooning all

07:16.080 --> 07:20.480
about crisis core some kind of surprise it's very linear I mean if you don't get

07:20.480 --> 07:26.320
a lot of place I mean you can go explore a little bit but it's very empty I don't

07:26.320 --> 07:30.680
know it's just I maybe I'm not that far into the game maybe not far enough to

07:30.680 --> 07:33.360
where the game just shifts to where you can run around anywhere and do whatever

07:33.360 --> 07:40.040
but it's just very linear and just empty even more so than like the other but

07:40.040 --> 07:44.200
that's kind of typical for like a PSP game though they're usually very sparse

07:44.200 --> 07:48.680
because they can't handle them any polygons on the screen stuff but that

07:48.680 --> 07:51.400
might be the first negative thing I've heard about crisis core it's just I

07:51.400 --> 07:55.680
can't get into it I want to get into it because it looks really cool but we got

07:55.680 --> 07:59.160
to get to the chat room for comments chat orange lounge radio.com if you want

07:59.160 --> 08:02.500
to join us or if you're on the game surge network where the all games chat

08:02.500 --> 08:06.240
room also is we're in our own chat room at channel orange lounge and first

08:06.240 --> 08:11.320
comment tonight from act theft he says more like crisis bore that is that what

08:11.320 --> 08:17.840
it is then I mean I actually instead of playing the game on my you know flight

08:17.840 --> 08:21.640
back I decided to read the sky mall magazine that gives you an idea I chose

08:21.640 --> 08:28.200
the sky ball magazine over crisis core sky ball has some pretty sweet stuff and

08:28.200 --> 08:31.520
they do have some pretty interesting things in there they had some things I

08:31.520 --> 08:38.760
was like hey that's a pretty cool idea good times anything else um I played

08:38.760 --> 08:43.880
something else oh I was playing this web flash game it's for Castle Crashers but

08:43.880 --> 08:49.440
you're fighting a guy with a beard what is a giant head with a beard wait it's

08:49.440 --> 08:53.120
it's a demo for Castle Crashers no it's like a flash game that the guy that

08:53.120 --> 08:57.000
created Castle Crashers made with the character okay also Crashers and you're

08:57.000 --> 09:01.680
fighting the guy the beard interesting it I can't remember the name of it I'll

09:01.680 --> 09:07.040
find it but uh it was interesting all righty I never say this name right I

09:07.040 --> 09:11.720
apologize this poor guy oh we too says Loki is reviewing a game but nothing

09:11.720 --> 09:17.600
compares to his beloved Grand Theft Auto 4 is that true I mean it's good I just

09:17.600 --> 09:21.120
enjoyed a lot more I don't know it's not I'm not seeing that it's better than any

09:21.120 --> 09:25.440
game out there it's just I'm enjoying it a lot more right now I mean what's he

09:25.440 --> 09:29.960
throw to comes out who knows I mean awesome that probably awesome for

09:29.960 --> 09:33.040
completely disagrees with you says crisis core is the downright best game

09:33.040 --> 09:38.280
on the PSP I don't know about that all right what would you say is the best

09:38.280 --> 09:43.720
game on the PSP out of can I see played so far yeah you know I'd probably have

09:43.720 --> 09:48.560
to say grant that thought of I knew it I knew it just just because I played a lot

09:48.560 --> 09:53.880
of that game it's just it's fun but you know I don't know if they put like Final

09:53.880 --> 09:58.520
Fantasy 7 like the actual 7 on there I would probably say that would be pretty

09:58.520 --> 10:03.840
fun and Final Fantasy 1 on the PSP was pretty fun so I don't know just maybe

10:03.840 --> 10:09.240
some more of the retro games I guess I like stuff well I'll say like I liked

10:09.240 --> 10:14.240
Space Invaders extreme I really like that game but that game did seem like a lot

10:14.240 --> 10:18.080
of fun with the few minutes I played the one you had any of I that's something

10:18.080 --> 10:21.560
they need to bring to live in like the PlayStation Network seriously that would

10:21.560 --> 10:25.200
do so well for them but Space Invaders extreme by the way like if you like

10:25.200 --> 10:31.200
those like music Gucci games like resin stuff or every extend extra like mix

10:31.200 --> 10:34.080
that with Space Invaders that's what Space Invaders extreme is it's pretty

10:34.080 --> 10:40.920
hot because I am a huge like Loki is to Grand Theft Auto I love music Gucci like

10:40.920 --> 10:45.400
I everything he touches I will do felt like I even defended 99 nights okay like

10:45.400 --> 10:50.440
I'll admit it wait what you say that I don't even know what that 99 nights came

10:50.440 --> 10:54.160
out of the Xbox 360 and it was kind of the what's the game is just like thank

10:54.160 --> 10:57.920
you dynasty warriors but it had its issues but I came on the show and I was

10:57.920 --> 11:07.320
like it's not a bad game it just needs a little work so we all have our things we

11:07.320 --> 11:14.880
get fanboy over what do you get fanboy over rice princess or fangirl I don't

11:14.880 --> 11:18.720
really have anything currently that I get all like mmm over anymore just the

11:18.720 --> 11:25.040
typical like Nintendo franchises what about Chrono Trigger oh okay cuz I seem

11:25.040 --> 11:27.560
to remember a few weeks ago on this program I took a lot of heat for not

11:27.560 --> 11:32.600
declaring okay Chrono Trigger is great didn't care too much about Chrono Cross

11:32.600 --> 11:36.280
didn't wasn't really impressed by that Chrono Trigger remake they were doing

11:36.280 --> 11:42.400
the 3d one what okay that's not a 3d child I am like strictly a 2d type of

11:42.400 --> 11:45.800
person all right that's why I didn't care for it but yeah I'm kind of a

11:45.800 --> 11:49.240
boring person when it comes you like your games very two-dimensional and

11:49.240 --> 11:53.560
vanilla totally yeah what about the 2d games with that 3d kind of look to them

11:53.560 --> 11:58.000
like I don't know beautiful Joe kind of that's see that's cool with me and it's

11:58.000 --> 12:02.400
not okay it's it's case by case it's not strictly I won't play any 3d games I

12:02.400 --> 12:07.900
play 3d games it's just my preference I feel that they put more effort into the

12:07.900 --> 12:11.320
game when it's 2d because they're not focusing on trying to make it look all

12:11.320 --> 12:16.520
cool because it's 3d I don't know I just Super Nintendo forever comments from

12:16.520 --> 12:20.480
chat siren says and I'm probably another name I'm mispronouncing but you know

12:20.480 --> 12:24.440
what I do that I'm mispronouncing it's amateur radio says Chrono Trigger equals

12:24.440 --> 12:28.240
not that great oh you equals not that great

12:28.240 --> 12:33.360
awesome first says 99 nights I remember being reviewed on x-play with a girl

12:33.360 --> 12:38.560
screaming horribly I remember watching x-play and I was screaming horribly

12:38.560 --> 12:43.400
you're such a dork all right well how was your gaming way what kind of games

12:43.400 --> 12:46.400
have you been playing this week I'm assuming Loki's done if he's not I cut

12:46.400 --> 12:51.960
him off what how was your gaming week I'm done boring I played Wow and I

12:51.960 --> 12:58.160
started playing puzzle pirates again nerd okay if for whatever reason let's

12:58.160 --> 13:01.160
say a listener the show has never heard of puzzle pirates before is it a free

13:01.160 --> 13:06.720
MMO okay it went from beta to charge and now they have kind of this system where

13:06.720 --> 13:11.360
you can play for free and then like buy certain aspects of the game with real

13:11.360 --> 13:15.320
money like if you want to have Johnny Depp hair you got a yeah exactly yeah

13:15.320 --> 13:19.120
like clothes or an island or something like that you can pay for it but

13:19.120 --> 13:22.920
essentially it's just a big puzzle game if you've ever played something like

13:22.920 --> 13:25.660
puzzle quest or something it's kind of sort of like that but in a pirate

13:25.660 --> 13:31.000
setting you sail the ship by playing a puzzle you build the stations you do

13:31.000 --> 13:34.920
carpentry all that crap you know but they're all like pop cap games basically

13:34.920 --> 13:37.880
because building is like bejeweled right yeah yeah it's pretty much like one of

13:37.880 --> 13:42.600
them was like dr. Mario yeah I think it was a sailing one yeah yeah but yeah

13:42.600 --> 13:46.640
it's basically what it is but it's fun and it's addictive and like it is like

13:46.640 --> 13:51.560
it's like pop cap the MMO with pirates exactly that is exactly what it is

13:51.560 --> 13:56.280
that's a great description so but it's really fun and I like have been spending

13:56.280 --> 13:59.080
countless hours playing I know a few people have really gotten sucked into

13:59.080 --> 14:01.800
puzzle pirates yeah a few people on my live journal on the friends list they

14:01.800 --> 14:06.160
just always talk about you know puzzle pirates it's good time it's like Wow for

14:06.160 --> 14:13.600
the puzzle crowd I guess you could say all right yeah pretty cool my gaming

14:13.600 --> 14:16.960
week I must be I feel like the one person on the planet who has not been

14:16.960 --> 14:21.640
all getting into Grand Theft Auto 4 here's my thing I like I respect let me

14:21.640 --> 14:25.640
put this I respect Grand Theft Auto 4 I think it is a good game but it's just

14:25.640 --> 14:29.920
not kind of like my thing like I have this big concern I'm gonna spend $60 in

14:29.920 --> 14:33.080
this game and I don't really play Grand Theft Auto for the story because I'm

14:33.080 --> 14:37.440
just not into those types of stories and I think I would have a lot of fun

14:37.440 --> 14:41.120
running around for like three hours and blowing everything up I possibly can and

14:41.120 --> 14:44.480
shooting people in the face but then I think it would kind of get old for me

14:44.480 --> 14:47.920
but I don't know the online modes make me think maybe I'd have a little more

14:47.920 --> 14:50.960
fun with it so I'm still kind of on the fence I want to wait for the game to

14:50.960 --> 14:53.920
come down in price but we all know that's not gonna happen for a long long

14:53.920 --> 14:58.720
time long time but you see long time you say that about it but I mean it's kind

14:58.720 --> 15:05.040
of like Wow you do the exact same thing over and over there's something more Wow

15:05.040 --> 15:09.440
has a chat room I can't explain it yeah I guess that's a good point but I mean

15:09.440 --> 15:16.040
I've always said game Wow Wow is a giant chat room with spells like basically you

15:16.040 --> 15:20.000
know kind of true but I mean like there is gonna be the you know there's the

15:20.000 --> 15:23.600
online element to it and I don't know you would just I think if you pick it up

15:23.600 --> 15:27.160
and play it you might get more into it than you actually think you would Rob

15:27.160 --> 15:32.520
it's just me there well J rod says why doesn't sky just borrow it from Loki

15:32.520 --> 15:36.800
does he keep it in a fireproof safe guarded by pit bulls or something no I

15:36.800 --> 15:42.400
think it's not a fireproof safe it's the safety deposit box that came with my you

15:42.400 --> 15:45.800
know my special edition plus I would I would think that Loki just wants to hang

15:45.800 --> 15:48.480
on to it for a little while he'll probably let me borrow it in like six

15:48.480 --> 15:52.160
weeks well I can't let you borrow because I have to use it at work when we

15:52.160 --> 15:57.760
play our weekly death match early death matches so I mean I have four copies of

15:57.760 --> 16:02.440
the game right now you gotta let that Loki has four copies of the game and he

16:02.440 --> 16:07.520
won't let me borrow one five we have five people that want to play it at work

16:07.520 --> 16:12.160
and in fact I need to get another copy of it it's fine it's fine like I said I

16:12.160 --> 16:17.800
will buy it eventually I don't know when that's going to be he's only got four

16:17.800 --> 16:22.920
copies Rob I will find you one shit God it's all good don't worry about it I

16:22.920 --> 16:26.960

16:56.400 --> 17:02.360

alone you that one how nice alright what I did want to play for you guys as I

20:06.840 --> 20:09.880
promised last week I said we got a really great entry from somebody who

20:09.880 --> 20:13.520
unfortunately is ineligible because for reasons beyond our control namely the

20:13.520 --> 20:17.800
fact that the limited edition console that is the grand prize only works in

20:17.800 --> 20:20.880
the United States or North American regions I should say Canada Mexico are

20:20.880 --> 20:25.920
fine but it will not work in Europe okay we had to say you know North American

20:25.920 --> 20:29.760
residents only so unfortunately this guy was ineligible but I think the commercial

20:29.760 --> 20:35.000
is so damn funny I want you guys to hear it so this is Martin from Belgium and

20:35.000 --> 20:38.760
this is his entry for the contest that unfortunately is ineligible we wanted to

20:38.760 --> 20:42.240
play it on the show because it's so great introducing Loki's world of

20:42.240 --> 20:47.680
randomness do you have no free time are you tired of raising your children are

20:47.680 --> 20:52.640
your children little pussies getting beat up just drop them in front of the

20:52.640 --> 20:57.600
TV with Loki's world of randomness run around a virtual world in a bingle

20:57.600 --> 21:02.240
outfit while performing random acts it will teach your children important

21:02.240 --> 21:11.480
skills such as how to attach a laser to their pet cat disembodied heads how to

21:11.480 --> 21:18.400
take pictures of guys kissing or how to shout fuck a combination of all of the

21:18.400 --> 21:23.040
above if your children suffer mental damage from playing this game or start

21:23.040 --> 21:29.560
killing their friends with their laser cats it may result in a bonus lawsuit

21:29.560 --> 21:34.920
settlement from our legal department this game is approved by wappy play.com

21:34.920 --> 21:42.600
rated r4 retarded perfect that is a perfect example of an entry it was

21:42.600 --> 21:47.760
beautiful it might have damn well won if Martin was eligible but he's not so

21:47.760 --> 21:50.760
what's going to happen is that we're going to pick our favorites like three

21:50.760 --> 21:54.040
four finalists I don't know depends on the entries we get you can still submit

21:54.040 --> 21:57.320
them by the way you have like five and a half hours so if you haven't submitted

21:57.320 --> 22:01.040
anything yet you have time because you have to midnight Pacific tonight to get

22:01.040 --> 22:04.360
your entries in so you can send those in mailbag orange on twitter.com if you're

22:04.360 --> 22:08.220
listening right now if you're listening on the podcast you're screwed so if you

22:08.220 --> 22:10.640
want to submit it in you have like five and a half hours I'll tell you what you

22:10.640 --> 22:14.560
don't have a lot of competition because only like a handful of people did it so

22:14.560 --> 22:18.000
I guess not that many people want the limited edition one in a grand theft auto

22:18.000 --> 22:21.040
god I don't know I'll tell you it's because they know that I'm going to win

22:21.040 --> 22:26.520
you're ineligible asshole all right so anyway but I will say there are some

22:26.520 --> 22:30.520
other good ones too we will play our favorites in a special podcast that will

22:30.520 --> 22:34.320
roll out sometime this week you guys can vote for them on our site www.orange

22:34.320 --> 22:37.200
on twitter.com it the special podcast will be like just eight minutes long

22:37.200 --> 22:40.360
with the finalists and you can vote so you know who you're voting for on

22:40.360 --> 22:45.400
orange on twitter.com good times so that winner will be announced next week's

22:45.400 --> 22:50.200
show and also did anyone else notice this is slow news week this week thanks

22:50.200 --> 22:55.880
to grand theft auto for what I see you're smiling evilly over there I is

22:55.880 --> 23:01.680
it just me that noticed it was a slow news week I don't know no no I didn't

23:01.680 --> 23:05.160
notice well because I was too busy playing grand that's why I thought my

23:05.160 --> 23:09.200
gaming weeks as I skipped it earlier really not a whole lot of new stuff

23:09.200 --> 23:13.160
because actually I haven't been playing wow a lot lately I kind of took a break

23:13.160 --> 23:17.000
from Wow one game I have been playing quite a lot of and I kind of surprised

23:17.000 --> 23:20.720
myself as Mario Kart Wii I've actually been having a lot of fun with Mario Kart

23:20.720 --> 23:24.760
Wii I don't play with the wheel either I think the wheel is kind of stupid and it

23:24.760 --> 23:29.480
doesn't control well for me so I use the nunchuck and wiimote which works great I

23:29.480 --> 23:33.600
really like controlling it that way and I was actually playing online for like

23:33.600 --> 23:37.760
an hour or two today and I was having a lot of fun just playing against the

23:37.760 --> 23:40.800
random people because you know how online you don't have a lot of control

23:40.800 --> 23:45.880
but at least the online you notice for Nintendo is starting to slowly inch by

23:45.880 --> 23:50.920
inch get a little better slowly because at least this time it kind of introduces

23:50.920 --> 23:53.680
you to the other players you're about to battle and like shows you where they're

23:53.680 --> 23:57.400
from and you actually get to see their me's and their name unlike kind of like

23:57.400 --> 24:01.240
Smash Brothers ball was like brawl was like completely you know anonymous at

24:01.240 --> 24:03.640
least this time you get to know a little bit about the people you're going up

24:03.640 --> 24:06.840
against and you can play with friends like the other night we were playing on

24:06.840 --> 24:10.560
myself and my roommate were playing against miklotov remember him from the

24:10.560 --> 24:13.880
show he he's lives in Kansas now we were playing against him on the internet and

24:13.880 --> 24:17.160
the cool thing is you can have two people playing on one console and he

24:17.160 --> 24:21.280
kicked our ass ten times in a row I was so mad but I was still a dumb noob so

24:21.280 --> 24:24.040
that's what I chalk it up to but we're just having a lot of fun with the online

24:24.040 --> 24:28.360
I actually think online is kind of fun you know obviously the lack of voice

24:28.360 --> 24:32.200
chat and the lack of a deep decent friend code system I mean nothing new

24:32.200 --> 24:37.280
that no one hasn't said about Nintendo before but it's getting a little better

24:37.280 --> 24:44.680
a little baby steps Nintendo's making baby steps so but I phone Mario Kart we

24:44.680 --> 24:49.220
and some of the courses are amazing like I love the Koopa cape which is that

24:49.220 --> 24:52.840
level that's like the kind of like the island one with all the rivers and then

24:52.840 --> 24:56.320
you go you actually go down into a pipe for part of it and you're like driving

24:56.320 --> 24:59.760
through the pipe and then you come out it's awesome so I really like some of

24:59.760 --> 25:03.520
the course design in Mario Kart we I kind of wish there was more of them

25:03.520 --> 25:07.880
j-rod and chat asks hey sky whatever happened the Lost Odyssey you ever

25:07.880 --> 25:12.800
finished that four-disc behemoth um no you know I got towards the end of the

25:12.800 --> 25:15.840
first disc I think I know I'm on the second disc a Lost Odyssey actually and

25:15.840 --> 25:22.440
then Irene called and was like Rob Karazhan and that was the end the Lost

25:22.440 --> 25:25.240
Odyssey no I that's the game I really really do need to go back and beat

25:25.240 --> 25:30.720
because it was amazing amazing story alright now we can get into tonight's

25:30.720 --> 25:36.800
news hooray I'll start tonight speaking of the Nintendo we there is a special

25:36.800 --> 25:41.520
version of the we that is soon going to roll out to hotels it's actually going

25:41.520 --> 25:45.880
to be at the Westin hotels Westin's is a pretty upscale chain of hotels I was

25:45.880 --> 25:49.280
fortunate enough to stay in one in San Francisco once they're really nice kind

25:49.280 --> 25:53.400
of swanky hotels they're actually going to be putting wheeze in their workout

25:53.400 --> 25:58.720
rooms it's like a we workout okay or Westin workout is the program and then

25:58.720 --> 26:01.920
the wheeze is going to be in this here's the interesting thing the wheeze that

26:01.920 --> 26:05.440
they're going to be getting the games are in there automatically no discs are

26:05.440 --> 26:09.680
required so I'm assuming it's you know on the limited space that's in there and

26:09.680 --> 26:14.300
the hotel or is good they're going to slowly add things like we fit and we

26:14.300 --> 26:19.640
sports apparently this whole thing is kind of quote ideal for business

26:19.640 --> 26:23.800
travelers and families who want to stay energized while on the road that's a

26:23.800 --> 26:28.560
quote from the press release that was put out by Nintendo and Westin earlier

26:28.560 --> 26:32.840
this week so what do you think interesting kind of interesting you

26:32.840 --> 26:36.440
don't see video games and workout rooms very often but it just kind of goes to

26:36.440 --> 26:42.840
show that whole like you know the whole we is an exercise machine craze that's

26:42.840 --> 26:45.840
going on though I don't know how many calories do you really lose playing we

26:45.840 --> 26:51.400
sport I know that you know it depends on how much you play I guess really I guess

26:51.400 --> 26:54.440
being a little bit active is being better than not active at all but

26:54.440 --> 26:58.440
exactly it's just kind of hard for me to kind of picture a we standing next to a

26:58.440 --> 27:00.960
treadmill when you know damn well you're gonna burn more calories on that

27:00.960 --> 27:05.000
treadmill yeah that is true but it makes it more fun and more interactive I mean

27:05.000 --> 27:09.720
like and I don't know boxing have you played boxing like a few times in a row

27:09.720 --> 27:13.360
yeah okay the boxing yeah I gotta get give that to you that definitely does

27:13.360 --> 27:16.200
tell you figure out actually how to play the boxing game realize that all you

27:16.200 --> 27:22.240
just flick your wrist and shut up Loki no but um no I think that's a pretty

27:22.240 --> 27:27.320
cool idea I mean I'd probably rather play that than hop on the treadmill or

27:27.320 --> 27:31.440
lift a bunch of weights you know or something Frisbee asks but what person

27:31.440 --> 27:35.080
is gonna put play Twilight Princess in a hotel workout room well I don't think

27:35.080 --> 27:37.960
that'll be one of the games that's on it because they said you can't put discs in

27:37.960 --> 27:41.760
here so I'm assuming it's going to be games like you know we sports and we fit

27:41.760 --> 27:45.000
in the more active type games yeah I don't if it's gonna be in the workout

27:45.000 --> 27:49.120
room why would they put Twilight Frisbee in our chat also says just put a DDR

27:49.120 --> 27:54.880
machine in there that's that's true why not idea DDR has been around for what 10

27:54.880 --> 27:58.320
years now you haven't heard about that going into workout rooms although DDR is

27:58.320 --> 28:02.160
kind of gone into the mainstream in other places such as school physical

28:02.160 --> 28:05.560
fitness programs we've heard a lot about yeah it's kind of interesting yeah that's

28:05.560 --> 28:09.840
really not a bad how about DDR on the Wii that's like you know workout times

28:09.840 --> 28:17.040
too yeah right totally I think it's also uber lame me you were not a fan of DDR

28:17.040 --> 28:22.800
on the Wii it's stupid it's like oh hey you remember how much how awesome hands

28:22.800 --> 28:27.840
and feet mode was in the PlayStation 2 DDR's yeah let's bring that to the Wii

28:27.840 --> 28:32.320
simple do with the Wii remote oh guess what it still sucks that's right I

28:32.320 --> 28:36.960
didn't think it was that bad oh crap because it's randomly thrown in there

28:36.960 --> 28:40.120
just for the fuck of it and you look like an idiot doing that you don't have

28:40.120 --> 28:42.960
to play with that in there I understand that you know so they'll have to play

28:42.960 --> 28:46.600
with hands and feet mode but the thing is a couple things that was disappointing

28:46.600 --> 28:51.080
about one you couldn't add up your own edit steps using the hands and feet mode

28:51.080 --> 28:57.120
or you know the Wii remote and stuff like that and to just their placement

28:57.120 --> 29:02.760
in the songs as they were it's just kind of random so I don't know it just didn't

29:02.760 --> 29:07.640
really flow with the song at all so all right it was just like hey look you're

29:07.640 --> 29:10.680
burning more calories awesome yeah I do want to say one other thing about this

29:10.680 --> 29:14.560
story before we move on the Westin workout is only going to be at 10 hotels

29:14.560 --> 29:17.200
across the United States I mean obviously there's workout rooms and all

29:17.200 --> 29:20.840
their hotels I'm sure but this we think is only in 10 hotels for now so I'm

29:20.840 --> 29:24.640
assuming it's in the big cities in New York San Francisco whatever I'm assuming

29:24.640 --> 29:28.600
this will roll out slowly to more and more hotels if it's successful but we'll

29:28.600 --> 29:32.880
see because totally I'm not gonna stay at a hotel unless it has the Wii there

29:32.880 --> 29:36.960
well you know if you got a big family maybe those are types of things you look

29:36.960 --> 29:41.840
for or how about this I don't know if you're vacationing how about you just go

29:41.840 --> 29:46.840
outside and go visit places of interest and get your exercise that way and stay

29:46.840 --> 29:50.680
up like hey let's go to a hotel and go exercise in their exercise room okay

29:50.680 --> 29:54.640
can't do that at home imagine you're a big you're gonna have kids someday Loki

29:54.640 --> 29:57.440
you got married right and you're gonna have kids someday that's the long-term

29:57.440 --> 30:03.640
plan and my kids will understand how retarded shut up hold on is the thing is

30:03.640 --> 30:07.200
is that you're gonna be going out and let's say you know you go on a trip to

30:07.200 --> 30:10.880
Disneyland or whatever you're gonna be out at Disneyland all fucking day you

30:10.880 --> 30:14.160
and Ellie are gonna be tired as hell when you get back to the hotel and

30:14.160 --> 30:17.560
you're gonna want to go just die you know in the couch and watch TV or

30:17.560 --> 30:22.200
whatever but the kids they have energy nothing but energy so what better than

30:22.200 --> 30:26.040
for them to go to the workout room and burn some more of that energy yeah

30:26.040 --> 30:29.320
because the kids totally want to go to the workout room I can remember when I

30:29.320 --> 30:32.360
went to Disneyland I was like hell let's go to the workout room this would be so

30:32.360 --> 30:35.880
awesome instead of like hey let's go down the arcade downstairs or I don't

30:35.880 --> 30:39.520
know hey let's go out to the pool I go around some or hey let's go run around

30:39.520 --> 30:44.840
or hey how about we play some video games on the TV there I hope your kids

30:44.840 --> 30:48.960
are twice as angry as you they're seriously gonna go are they fucking

30:48.960 --> 30:53.200
serious they want us to go work out downstairs are you fucking crazy you

30:53.200 --> 30:56.640
call me I'll be like shut up Billy you're only five you can't talk back to

30:56.640 --> 31:02.120
me like that you're grounded I hope you really do name your kid Billy okay this

31:02.120 --> 31:05.680
is great act deaf thank you act deaf just backing me up here a little bit act

31:05.680 --> 31:11.040
deaf says Loki this is probably made for busy businessmen and women that go to

31:11.040 --> 31:16.680
places but not actually visit the place excellent point oh so it says in the

31:16.680 --> 31:20.600
press release oh well that makes all the difference why don't they just get some

31:20.600 --> 31:26.880
work done instead and like okay I do this I'm a business traveler I go teach

31:26.880 --> 31:30.200
in other places sometimes I haven't done it for a while sometimes I go to LA or

31:30.200 --> 31:33.560
I go to you know wherever and I don't get put up at the Westin but if if I was

31:33.560 --> 31:37.340
the president of the company I might okay I might actually get a kick out of

31:37.340 --> 31:41.800
this all right fine go get a kick out of this I hope it's worth all the thousands

31:41.800 --> 31:46.600
of dollars that they probably had to pay for it to be exclusive there or I'm

31:46.600 --> 31:51.320
done I'm done I want to move on new subject well another disappointing idea

31:51.320 --> 31:58.520
was the idea to remove clovers credits from the Okami we version not surprised

31:58.520 --> 32:01.680
that clover has been kind of getting the shaft ever since you know they were

32:01.680 --> 32:12.840
disbanded but kind of that he said shaft yes I said shaft that's right shaft so

32:12.840 --> 32:17.240
you know it's not a big surprise that with the Wii version of the game coming

32:17.240 --> 32:22.280
out hell let's just get it even sloppier and other than putting watermarks on our

32:22.280 --> 32:26.040
covers let's just remove their they didn't really work on the game it's all

32:26.040 --> 32:31.760
Capcom according to the new game now as I understand it their defense for taking

32:31.760 --> 32:35.920
out the thing was that well clovers not around anymore and the logo was in this

32:35.920 --> 32:40.360
movie file that we couldn't get the logo out of so we took out the whole movie

32:40.360 --> 32:44.520
file that was their defense they couldn't get the logo out of the movie

32:44.520 --> 32:47.800
file yes because they did not have the raw movie file from clover because

32:47.800 --> 32:52.920
clovers gone wow that was there I swear to god I'm not making out that was the

32:52.920 --> 32:58.000
excuse wow that's pretty retarded hell I could get the movie file from just a

32:58.000 --> 33:02.240
fucking video of it it's called script print screen folks print screen you put

33:02.240 --> 33:06.640
the movie file up and you take a screen capture and then you can crop it down of

33:06.640 --> 33:09.440
course I guess you wouldn't know how to do that since you came fucking find a

33:09.440 --> 33:15.200
picture without a watermark it's just fucking lazy whiz Capcom gotten really

33:15.200 --> 33:18.960
lazy lately I mean seriously you know with all the fucking Megaman games and

33:18.960 --> 33:21.700
shit that they've got coming out in Street Fighter remakes and fucking

33:21.700 --> 33:25.600
remakes of other games do they have an original idea left with them I mean

33:25.600 --> 33:30.840
seriously whatever it's Okami it's been out before buy it now because you're a

33:30.840 --> 33:34.240
whore and you'll buy these stupid remakes if there is nothing different

33:34.240 --> 33:38.960
with the game other than it's ad waggle so I hope you enjoy your fucking ps2

33:38.960 --> 33:44.240
port that really had that rant had nothing to do with the credits getting

33:44.240 --> 33:48.640
cut well it sucks for clover because God hand was awesome

33:48.640 --> 33:53.800
Okami haven't played it comments from chat any any quick thoughts rice

33:53.800 --> 33:59.080
princess before we go to chat not at all awesome for a chat says clover got

33:59.080 --> 34:03.440
shanked on that deal they made the game they went out of business but WTF they

34:03.440 --> 34:08.180
should still get the credit act-def says Capcom were lazy siren says Capcom

34:08.180 --> 34:14.240
quickly make Marvel vs. Capcom 3 chat orange on radio calm okay I'm just just

34:14.240 --> 34:19.700
so you know they have on joystick an actual video that was part of the end

34:19.700 --> 34:26.120
credit sequence you know with clovers no logo in there and for one I don't see

34:26.120 --> 34:30.280
why they couldn't just I don't know keep that video sequence since it's pretty

34:30.280 --> 34:36.760
badass looking anyways but still though they can't do a screen capture of this

34:36.760 --> 34:45.080
thing I just that boggles my mind sorry Rama says in chat Loki some of us missed

34:45.080 --> 34:51.320
it the first time around okay great you know I'm sorry that you missed it the

34:51.320 --> 34:54.520
first time around maybe you should I don't know keep up with games that are

34:54.520 --> 34:59.600
coming up you're so rude what if somebody doesn't have a PlayStation 2

34:59.600 --> 35:05.240
and they couldn't play it the first time around well then boo-hoo go to a

35:05.240 --> 35:10.720
friend's house all right I don't know what see okay I'm going to tell you what

35:10.720 --> 35:14.960
I'm going to I'm going to make a capture of the logo I'm going to do the

35:14.960 --> 35:19.520
impossible just look at me I'm fucking David Copperfield pulling out you know

35:19.520 --> 35:25.840
impossible feats all right have fun let's go to me oh look at this whoa

35:25.840 --> 35:30.440
look at that I made a screen capture oh I'm fucking awesome oh that must have

35:30.440 --> 35:34.280
been really hard dude seriously they have people like working there they're

35:34.280 --> 35:37.920
complete idiots I guess so I mean with you know shit sliding through like the

35:37.920 --> 35:44.320
watermark all right moving on talking about other we news it's a pretty

35:44.320 --> 35:47.720
exciting developments in the virtual console world especially if you are in

35:47.720 --> 35:51.320
the PAL regions meaning you know Europe and the like if you're in the PAL

35:51.320 --> 35:55.680

Wikipedia or something to understand its awesomeness awesomely badness that's

36:30.200 --> 36:34.040

36:47.400 --> 36:52.920
upcoming festival for PAL regions so enjoy well mother fans are gonna like

36:52.920 --> 36:58.560
this earthbound has been now rated by the ESRB for the Wii virtual console so

36:58.560 --> 37:04.560
you can uh you know actually get to play mother to here pretty soon and no word

37:04.560 --> 37:09.280
on yet when it's coming out but probably pretty soon since it just hasn't been

37:09.280 --> 37:15.480
rated and of course there are some other games other than earthbound that have

37:15.480 --> 37:23.640
been rated as well some of these including super dodgeball which is not a

37:23.640 --> 37:27.600
big surprise since I believe dodgeball brawlers is coming out here on the DS

37:27.600 --> 37:37.120
pretty soon samurai showdown 2 metal slug and Donkey Kong Country 3 Rob what's

37:37.120 --> 37:41.800
that you need to get earthbound and you actually should finish it I should I I

37:41.800 --> 37:45.540
do love earthbound you know I don't know why I just because I always rented the

37:45.540 --> 37:48.200
game I never actually owned the game I always rented it and they never just I

37:48.200 --> 37:52.120
always ran out of time to finish it but I love it totally like an adult and

37:52.120 --> 37:56.240
you've been one for like a long time so you shouldn't like go well you're

37:56.240 --> 38:01.200
totally like a bitch and you've been one for a long time so you should like it

38:01.200 --> 38:05.760
you should like actually finish games Rob I know it's I have look I've told

38:05.760 --> 38:11.680
the listeners about this before I have gaming a DD I start a game and then

38:11.680 --> 38:15.180
another game comes out and I go shiny and I throw the other game at a deep

38:15.180 --> 38:17.960
dark closet and I start playing the new game and then something else comes out

38:17.960 --> 38:21.400
and it's a cycle I've total gamer a DD and by the way he means World of

38:21.400 --> 38:27.640
Warcraft yes that old game but he throws into the closet not even this is you

38:27.640 --> 38:30.680
know what not even necessarily World of Warcraft me I haven't played it and you

38:30.680 --> 38:35.120
know I took like a week and a half off the game so you know once in a while you

38:35.120 --> 38:40.120
know I go into console mode or whatever so I know that's kind of sad I've kind

38:40.120 --> 38:45.000
of drifted from consoles in the past few years I used to be like totally pro

38:45.000 --> 38:49.160
console and like kind of sort of anti PC but now it's kind of switched I'm not

38:49.160 --> 38:52.520
anti console but I just don't play console but the only PC game you're

38:52.520 --> 38:59.760
playing is World of Warcraft and puzzle pirates my bad yeah this is why World of

38:59.760 --> 39:03.260
Warcraft doesn't come out for consoles it's it's keeping PC gaming alive it is

39:03.260 --> 39:07.120
PC gaming I should say I'm gonna get angry emails from PC gamers and there

39:07.120 --> 39:10.960
well there obviously is much more but obviously World of Warcraft is the

39:10.960 --> 39:14.700
behemoth you can't deny that but there are games come to come in on the turn

39:14.700 --> 39:22.360
pack like spore that are gonna be the same thing so you know we're probably I

39:22.360 --> 39:25.680
don't know like this isn't in the show role because I couldn't find the actual

39:25.680 --> 39:30.800
story for it but I mentioned this to you last night how that they have found a

39:30.800 --> 39:33.720
way now since you know they've completely ripped apart the virtual

39:33.720 --> 39:37.040
console they know how to pirate all the games now and stuff now they figured out

39:37.040 --> 39:40.480
how to put games into the virtual console I heard about this how does it

39:40.480 --> 39:46.400
work basically with you know it's kind of like the Xbox 360 and how they

39:46.400 --> 39:51.600
emulates the Xbox games each virtual console game has an emulator built in

39:51.600 --> 39:54.880
with it so what they're basically doing is keeping the emulator in there and

39:54.880 --> 39:59.880
then stripping out the ROM and throwing another ROM in there so it would run off

39:59.880 --> 40:05.160
that emulator and so it works on they've done it with pilot wing 64 Smash

40:05.160 --> 40:11.080
Brothers and some other stuff but I was thinking you know hey you know the

40:11.080 --> 40:15.880
potential for this you can Guardian legends you could do you know Super

40:15.880 --> 40:19.480
Mario RPG pretty much anything that's on the virtual console and they've done it

40:19.480 --> 40:23.240
like I think they've extracted ROMs or put ROMs from other games that are on

40:23.240 --> 40:29.600
other regions into the u.s. ones I think basically just I don't know what'll

40:29.600 --> 40:34.120
happen is you'll see the logo and stuff for whatever game it originally was

40:34.120 --> 40:38.400
because I haven't figured out how to change that yet but with the rate that

40:38.400 --> 40:43.600
they're going right now that won't be long but it's just it's very interesting

40:43.600 --> 40:48.480
how much they've before this was all secure and now it's just poof like night

40:48.480 --> 40:53.320
and day just cracked completely open but uh you know I'm looking forward to like

40:53.320 --> 40:56.720
Guardian legend or something blaster master or something like that on a to

40:56.720 --> 41:01.760
put blaster master on my Wii be awesome oh man but are you worried that there's

41:01.760 --> 41:04.720
going to be a Nintendo patch that comes out that shuts this whole thing off and

41:04.720 --> 41:08.920
possibly bricks consoles that did it I don't think that they can do that worry

41:08.920 --> 41:12.760
brick consoles and the other thing too is it's going to be hard for them to

41:12.760 --> 41:17.880
detect this stuff because they can see they can detect what virtual console

41:17.880 --> 41:23.960
games you you have bought they know that but like if you say for example pirate

41:23.960 --> 41:27.080
one of these games and throw it on there it doesn't detect that it's actually on

41:27.080 --> 41:32.080
the console it's just data that's on there so it would be hard for them to do

41:32.080 --> 41:36.720
that and also who's to say that you couldn't buy legitimate game like by you

41:36.720 --> 41:41.160
know Super Mario Brothers 2 or something like that and then go back delete that

41:41.160 --> 41:44.600
inject something into the Super Mario Brothers 2 file so it still looks like

41:44.600 --> 41:48.640
you have Super Mario Bros 2 but really is like guardian legend or something so

41:48.640 --> 41:52.360
I mean I don't know it's just interesting

41:52.360 --> 41:56.520
totient and chat says injecting ROMs is lame by the damn virtual console titles

41:56.520 --> 42:00.000
thanks well what if they're not out yet what if you keep waiting for me you just

42:00.000 --> 42:02.960
don't want to wait and who's to say that you couldn't buy them later on when they

42:02.960 --> 42:07.560
actually come out but now you're playing them it'll be interesting to see how

42:07.560 --> 42:14.600
long it takes Nintendo to cut this off frisbee says Mario RPG anyone totient

42:14.600 --> 42:19.520
says then buy them when they get out so I guess that would be okay moving on to

42:19.520 --> 42:22.600
non virtual console related things and talking about other types of games for

42:22.600 --> 42:27.240
the Wii and yes we play Xbox 360 and ps3 too it just so happens a lot of we news

42:27.240 --> 42:32.960
this week boogie is apparently going to be getting a sequel boogie superstar has

42:32.960 --> 42:38.320
apparently been slated for October it's been spotted on some websites out there

42:38.320 --> 42:42.040
for shopping I guess like game I don't know they don't say exactly where but

42:42.040 --> 42:47.160
I'm assuming it's either like game flyer game stop one of those October 14th is

42:47.160 --> 42:51.720
apparently going to be the release date boogie the first one wasn't really that

42:51.720 --> 42:55.480
critically heralded but I guess it did okay out there in the marketplace I

42:55.480 --> 42:59.760
imagine the engine since it's been built it's probably not that hard to inject

42:59.760 --> 43:03.920
new songs and I know there's a new my sims game coming out they saw some

43:03.920 --> 43:09.800
details on it's like my sims mmm I say like medieval fantasy or something like

43:09.800 --> 43:13.480
that it's like said in medieval times but it sounds just like Animal Crossing

43:13.480 --> 43:18.000
now like they're ripping that off big time oh well won't be long speaking of

43:18.000 --> 43:22.160
games like boogie completely random tangent karaoke revolution because I was

43:22.160 --> 43:24.900
thinking about games where they don't change a lot from game to game but the

43:24.900 --> 43:29.160
song list karaoke revolution right you remember that game okay I saw a movie

43:29.160 --> 43:32.320
this week baby mama which was like you know I think was like the number one

43:32.320 --> 43:35.320
movie the box office last week I'm sure it's not anymore thanks to Ironman but

43:35.320 --> 43:39.800
you know baby mama came out karaoke revolution is like a plot device in the

43:39.800 --> 43:43.040
movie it's there's actually like a whole scene where they're playing karaoke

43:43.040 --> 43:45.780
revolution together and kind of like I don't want to spoil it but you know kind

43:45.780 --> 43:49.260
of bonding over karaoke revolution they're actually like explaining how to

43:49.260 --> 43:53.280
play the game and I'm like is this product placement like that's what it

43:53.280 --> 43:56.720
felt like to me I'm like the Konami by product placement in this movie or is

43:56.720 --> 44:00.360
this really like just that much a part of pop culture and I was thinking well

44:00.360 --> 44:05.040
why did they not use sing star hmm conspiracy I don't know but I thought

44:05.040 --> 44:09.360
that was actually kind of interesting have you played boogie I have not played

44:09.360 --> 44:13.800
boogie I've seen videos online I've heard from friends about it that's it I

44:13.800 --> 44:19.080
actually played boogie at a mutual friend's birthday party it was kind of

44:19.080 --> 44:24.360
it was okay I mean there was nothing special about it it was I mean it was

44:24.360 --> 44:28.840
just like karaoke revolution I think I there was like something where you can

44:28.840 --> 44:32.160
make a music video of it or you can like edit you know the words or something

44:32.160 --> 44:36.760
like that like to make it fancy but it's it kind of felt like something that was

44:36.760 --> 44:41.880
more palatable to two kids or something I don't know I don't know why as a lot

44:41.880 --> 44:46.320
of Wii games are yeah but I don't know I just didn't I wasn't thinking like oh

44:46.320 --> 44:51.080
this game needs a sequel they should make one you know when I played it so I

44:51.080 --> 44:54.720
think that's kind of weird but whatever I guess it was they got enough money

44:54.720 --> 44:59.840
from it so all right well sequel coming soon well something that's a little bit

44:59.840 --> 45:04.840
different that's being tested out right now in the Wii homebrew community is USB

45:04.840 --> 45:11.480
mass storage support and they just released the source code for USB mass

45:11.480 --> 45:18.240
storage device demo which right now only handles basic error handling and just

45:18.240 --> 45:22.800
some basic features but eventually what they're hoping to do with this is allow

45:22.800 --> 45:28.560
the USB support from the console to be able to use like memory sticks flash

45:28.560 --> 45:36.440
drives mp3 players you know and fat formatted USB hard drives and I don't

45:36.440 --> 45:41.800
know very interesting that you know kind of like what we saw with the PSP where

45:41.800 --> 45:47.840
they're adding features to the system that aren't yet available kind of solve

45:47.840 --> 45:52.160
some of the problems with the system and then probably will be added later on by

45:52.160 --> 45:56.280
Nintendo type thing kind of like what Sony did with like the music radio

45:56.280 --> 46:00.640
players and stuff like that on their system they went ahead and kind of saw

46:00.640 --> 46:05.120
what the homebrew community is doing and followed it up with their own they

46:05.120 --> 46:11.000
really do need to add mass storage to the Wii that's hurt seriously I should

46:11.000 --> 46:13.400
have had more forethought on that but I guess they were trying to keep the price

46:13.400 --> 46:19.320
down so bad but seriously seriously how much does like 512 I would think one

46:19.320 --> 46:23.800
patch and they could fix that I mean if homebrew can do it why can't the Wii

46:23.800 --> 46:29.720
roll out a patch to support it I think because they're just stupid well also

46:29.720 --> 46:33.600
good reason well also because the way they've got it formatted in like blocks

46:33.600 --> 46:38.800
I don't I mean I guess they could still do that but it's you know I don't know

46:38.800 --> 46:43.080
it's just it's no easily you know what I actually just was kind of screwing

46:43.080 --> 46:47.040
around one night and like I have a little mini SD card in my cell phone and

46:47.040 --> 46:50.640
I actually copied a Wii file like I copied the Mario Brothers channel just

46:50.640 --> 46:54.120
for giggles I copied it's in my card and it worked like I didn't have to format

46:54.120 --> 46:57.240
my card for blocks it's mixed in there with pictures I take them on my cell

46:57.240 --> 46:59.940
phone and everything else so it's like I have Mario Brothers in my pocket

46:59.940 --> 47:03.360
everywhere I go but you know it's just kind of messing around seeing if it

47:03.360 --> 47:05.840
will work and it did you didn't have to like format the card specifically for

47:05.840 --> 47:10.480
blocks I don't know it's just it's really lazy that's what it is hmm well

47:10.480 --> 47:13.120
we'll see who knows maybe we'll get a patch in the future especially they want

47:13.120 --> 47:16.760
people to keep buying the WiiWare games they want us to redownload it every time

47:16.760 --> 47:20.080
do the weed out we downloads things really slow sometimes I don't know if

47:20.080 --> 47:24.080
it's just me but sometimes that channel is god-awfully slow and downloading

47:24.080 --> 47:29.760
things especially if you haven't used the Wii in a while I don't know some

47:29.760 --> 47:32.560
other games that are coming out soon for the Wii they're gonna have some pretty

47:32.560 --> 47:38.360
interesting connectivity Ghostbusters you know it's coming out soon here's the

47:38.360 --> 47:42.040
thing is that a red fly the development team behind the Wii version of the game

47:42.040 --> 47:45.440
they're also doing the PlayStation 2 version just you know in the Wii version

47:45.440 --> 47:51.320
you're actually going to be able to use the DS wirelessly no you can't well this

47:51.320 --> 47:56.800
this is what's being reported well yes he came out reported here really it yeah

47:56.800 --> 48:00.240
unfortunately that was something that was rumored to be happening you know

48:00.240 --> 48:03.480
came out and said no that's not gonna happen who said that they actually came

48:03.480 --> 48:07.400
out and said no this was a rumor they did oh I would've been so awesome it

48:07.400 --> 48:11.400
would be an awesome idea and that's why exactly it wouldn't work because it

48:11.400 --> 48:15.800
would be something smart and unfortunately they can't do something

48:15.800 --> 48:21.280
smart because that would be wrong well I guess this is all you get then for cool

48:21.280 --> 48:24.520
news about the Ghostbusters game and it's kind of borderline cool I guess

48:24.520 --> 48:30.000
Bill Murray's coming back as old as he is to do the Ghostbusters lines he's

48:30.000 --> 48:32.760
actually going to be in the game he's recording lines for the game so Bill

48:32.760 --> 48:36.200
Murray will be in it I don't know I'm kind of I'm kind of given take on Bill

48:36.200 --> 48:42.120
Murray he's okay but I love Rushmore like if you've seen that movie from

48:42.120 --> 48:47.120
years ago he was great in that movie but lost in translation put me to sleep so

48:47.120 --> 48:52.320
I'm indifferent I'm Bill Murray there you have it yeah it's in fact here's the

48:52.320 --> 48:59.080
story here according to it's not actually the company he said the red

48:59.080 --> 49:02.600
factor whatever it is it's a company called terminal reality is the one

49:02.600 --> 49:05.600
behind it he says I'm sorry to report unfortunately this is not a feature of

49:05.600 --> 49:10.080
the Wii and DS version of the game it would have been really cool though and

49:10.080 --> 49:15.800
that's from terminal reality boss I agree it would be really cool fix it

49:15.800 --> 49:22.040
delay the game make it soon it's I mean did you say make it so no I didn't yes

49:22.040 --> 49:25.800
you did there was a member there is also that story a long time ago that they

49:25.800 --> 49:31.320
were gonna do head tracking with you know boom blocks but from what I hear

49:31.320 --> 49:34.920
and what I kind of gathered the reason they didn't do that is because Nintendo

49:34.920 --> 49:40.200
stopped it because they don't want people there is a story they don't want

49:40.200 --> 49:43.520
people moving a lot in their games cuz they're worried I guess that they're

49:43.520 --> 49:47.840
gonna get injured or something but it's almost like they they can't won't allow

49:47.840 --> 49:51.920
developers to do something innovative unless it's Nintendo's idea type thing

49:51.920 --> 49:56.480
you know to me then we'll we'll roll out the enhancements to your gameplay and

49:56.480 --> 50:07.800
then you just follow suit fucking lame interesting but this kind of goes back

50:07.800 --> 50:14.960
to a story that we talked about a couple weeks ago actually that whole pole

50:14.960 --> 50:21.160
dancing Wii game it's really being worked on it seriously is a peekaboo

50:21.160 --> 50:26.680
pole dancing now if anything I thought was a joke it was this so this is kind

50:26.680 --> 50:34.440
of shocking to me this is the basically a rep for peekaboo and the licensing

50:34.440 --> 50:39.840
agency at 18 new media Simon K this is where they have to say peekaboo will be

50:39.840 --> 50:43.360
all about fun and fitness for new generation peekaboo wants to make

50:43.360 --> 50:47.560
fitness benefits for aerobic pole dancing accessible to millions of we

50:47.560 --> 50:53.520
users robick pole dancing actually have pole dancing classes you can take it I

50:53.520 --> 51:00.440
know my friend is a good pole dancing party friend did you know no no because

51:00.440 --> 51:04.680
you know there's a pool right there you I'm good thank you the goal is to I

51:04.680 --> 51:08.880
would play this game the goal is to encourage men and women of all shapes

51:08.880 --> 51:13.520
and sizes to improve their pole dancing skills hey don't be sexist men can pole

51:13.520 --> 51:18.600
dance to privacy our own homes looking to improve their pole dancing skills

51:18.600 --> 51:23.880
while having fun toning up and burning calories ultimately peekaboo and 80 new

51:23.880 --> 51:29.480
media want to do for pole dancing what guitar hero did for rock and roll okay

51:29.480 --> 51:33.000
flash forward to a year from now okay here's here's a conversation that's

51:33.000 --> 51:36.840
actually going to happen like a year from now okay hey Rob where did you get

51:36.840 --> 51:45.840
those washboard abs I was playing peekaboo pole dancing that's what they

51:45.840 --> 51:50.800
should put at the Westin okay oh my god okay here's my thing with this okay this

51:50.800 --> 51:54.560
is never going to work I mean how the hell are they going to really this is

51:54.560 --> 51:58.480
really happening there really really is going to be really going to do this

51:58.480 --> 52:03.080
really really is not a joke I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't said uh no

52:03.080 --> 52:08.160
because I mean they ever happened to the seal of quality this right here it will

52:08.160 --> 52:12.240
yeah seriously what did happen to the seal of quality no this right here though

52:12.240 --> 52:17.600
is going to be so bad I mean granted it's not obviously it's not going to be

52:17.600 --> 52:22.360
a sexual game whatsoever but the fact that you put you know oh it's a game

52:22.360 --> 52:26.000
with us it's teaching you to be a stripper you know that's the spin that

52:26.000 --> 52:32.480
they're going to put on this shit I don't know it's just there was nothing

52:32.480 --> 52:37.640
said about stripping it's aerobic pole dancing there was nothing said about

52:37.640 --> 52:41.600
stripping yeah I participate in aerobic pole dancing and her I should say my

52:41.600 --> 52:48.320
wife participates in aerobic pole wow nice that's hot okay so is it just

52:48.320 --> 52:53.440
because they're trying to focus on aerobic games or games that get you

52:53.440 --> 52:59.340
moving it is a bad idea it really is a bad idea it's stupid like honestly how

52:59.340 --> 53:04.440
the hell are they gonna do this first off people are gonna you know from what

53:04.440 --> 53:08.400
I gather this stuff is pretty hard I mean it's not like something you can

53:08.400 --> 53:11.040
just go we're just gonna swing around on a pole and stuff you know you got to be

53:11.040 --> 53:14.480
pretty you know in shape to do this kind of crap people are gonna be falling on

53:14.480 --> 53:17.720
their fucking heads I mean it's not like the Wii balance board where you just

53:17.720 --> 53:22.280
stand there kind of lean to the side this is like fucking crazy shit I mean I

53:22.280 --> 53:25.920
don't know is it actually gonna come with a pole I think it's gonna come with

53:25.920 --> 53:31.280
a pole because this company they make like a stripper pole that you can buy

53:31.280 --> 53:38.600
they had they sell them at like fucking Spencer's nice so why do you think I

53:38.600 --> 53:46.200
understand how this would work because even okay just a bad idea aside how the

53:46.200 --> 53:49.100
hell are they gonna implement this cuz that's what I was gonna ask like you

53:49.100 --> 53:52.720
what are you gonna have like you know like buttons on this thing or something

53:52.720 --> 53:57.600
is it gonna sense your movement it I don't it doesn't seem like it would work

53:57.600 --> 54:00.200
they're like throwing a concept out there and like okay couple someone make

54:00.200 --> 54:04.640
this please because we can't think of a way to do it I just don't see them this

54:04.640 --> 54:09.400
is not gonna be it working I don't know people will buy it because it's weird I

54:09.400 --> 54:13.840
know that but which will come first Final Fantasy 13 or peekaboo pole

54:13.840 --> 54:24.160
dancing pull dancing so do you think they chose the Wii console because of

54:24.160 --> 54:28.200
the fact that it has like a sensor bar and they might incorporate because it's

54:28.200 --> 54:33.320
your fitness driven words you know and honestly the Wii has gotten into a lot

54:33.320 --> 54:39.720
of you know family homes where there's what the women are playing the Wii you

54:39.720 --> 54:47.480
mean like housewives moms like strippers yeah strippers yeah well I don't think

54:47.480 --> 54:51.080
strippers need to play this stripping game though or the I mean the excuse me

54:51.080 --> 54:56.160
aerobic pole dancing yeah I think they do that every night home and take their

54:56.160 --> 54:59.640
work home with them or anything so I don't think they're part of the

54:59.640 --> 55:06.640
demographic but you know like you know wives who want to try to feel special

55:06.640 --> 55:10.120
for their husband and want to be sexy for their house oh sweetie sit down I'm

55:10.120 --> 55:14.320
gonna do something special for you and they like turn on the Wii it's like

55:14.320 --> 55:17.840
you're kidding dude most guys would be happy that their wives are playing video

55:17.840 --> 55:21.680
games in the first place but a pole dancing video game that's like I do see

55:21.680 --> 55:27.160
the positives in that yeah I guess like all you have to add to that is her

55:27.160 --> 55:30.040
bringing you a beer and cooking your ribs for dinner and you're set oh that's

55:30.040 --> 55:37.560
it yeah that's it perfect yeah I don't know it's just maybe April Fool's joke

55:37.560 --> 55:43.760
that won't die yeah all right well these are not a joke it's the upcoming release

55:43.760 --> 55:47.400

too I think Call of Duty 4 is getting the game of the Year Edition finally on

57:42.000 --> 57:56.040
PlayStation 3 and see here I think that's pretty much it oh I thought this was

57:56.040 --> 58:03.320
still coming out but I think you may have moved again was it a blast works

58:03.320 --> 58:17.920
supposed to come out on the Wii I thought but I think it moved I don't know last works I'm really looking forward to hope that doesn't suck I would do Japanese

58:17.920 --> 58:22.000
release dates about this time but there is seriously nothing coming out in Japan

58:22.000 --> 58:25.360
this week at least on the calendar I have the next wave of games is not till

58:25.360 --> 58:29.040
the 15th which will be next week you have luminous arc 2 on the DS to look

58:29.040 --> 58:33.240

58:33.240 --> 58:36.920
gonna have to play the games you already have nothing new coming out in Japan

58:36.920 --> 58:50.160
sorry Japan where we're all no one gets excited and so we kind of teased this

58:50.160 --> 58:55.880
earlier when we decided not to go to e3 because of the ESA membership not

58:55.880 --> 58:58.640
because we weren't invited or anything just because you know we said I was on

58:58.640 --> 59:02.400
Bobby show where that happened by the way not this show whatever Bobby

59:02.400 --> 59:07.280
Blackwell five o'clock on all games whatever we're not going now but anyways

59:07.280 --> 59:15.720
Activision and video have discontinued their ESA membership and you know also

59:15.720 --> 59:22.600
kind of going along with that they are not going to be at e3 so according to

59:22.600 --> 59:28.640
ESA is rich Taylor's senior vice president communications and research he

59:28.640 --> 59:33.280
says we can confirm the Activision of it then bindi games I thought it was

59:33.280 --> 59:37.600
Activision Blizzard but you know I could be wrong opted to discontinue their

59:37.600 --> 59:41.720
membership the ESA remains dedicated to advancing our industry's objective as

59:41.720 --> 59:45.800
protecting intellectual property preserving First Amendment rights and

59:45.800 --> 59:50.880
fostering the benefits our beneficial environmental environment for the entire

59:50.880 --> 59:54.560
industry I guess you don't really have any offensive games or anything so they

59:54.560 --> 59:58.840
don't really need them to defend their rights for anything or you know at the

59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.200
same time I guess they don't really have to participate in their you know

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.960
defending the rights of gamers and gaming industry because they're doing it

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.800
for other people it's still kind of loops them in there it's kind of like

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:16.360
going along for a free ride type thing says uh let's see while the

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.400
Entertainment Software Association remains the permanent voice for the US

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.200
computer and video game publishers we can confirm that Activision and video

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:33.480
games opted to discontinue the membership and blah blah blah it's

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.320
interesting so why'd they do it that's the question of the week it doesn't say

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.760
I think they're just being cheap you think well think about it I mean if

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.080
you're you know a group of companies or whatever and you're paying the ESA to

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.560
say defend you from these you know laws out there that are you know trying to

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.200
prevent like say M rated games being sold to anybody or you know calling

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.440
games porn stuff like that if you say drop out of this you know organization

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.000
this organization is still working for other companies to do that defend them

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.800
against other things instead now they have less money to work with that's

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.240
really the only downside but they're still fighting for you it's just you're

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.200
not paying them you're kind of just sitting there you know it's like your

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.880
friends all chipping for pizzas like oh that's cool I'm not really hungry right

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.600
now and later on you know oh there's some pizza left over so you start you

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.400
know scoffing down a piece well you're just a freeloader yeah it still affects

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.160
them regardless of whether they're a member of the USA or not so they why

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.840
would they just pay to do that you know and also do they really make any games

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.000
that would be affected by any kind of law publicity Activision probably not

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.100
because I think they mainly just you know Call Duty 4 is probably the

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:54.600
riskiest thing that they have but that's not even really that bad probably not I

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.360
don't think you know there are a lot of movie licenses and yeah Tony Hawk and

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.280
yeah that's actually pretty smart on their part there you know they're gonna

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.920
be saving a but it's not cheap it's just you know I don't know I think act

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.300
deft and chat makes the comment a lot of people I've kind of seen have been

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:18.000
making this week screw e3 packs is where it's at yeah well e3 is kind of its

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.780
beginning its decline yes yeah like there's nothing special about e3 anymore

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.320
nobody cares about it I think the appeal you think these company actually missed

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:32.740
the old e3 it's possible yeah I don't know because a lot of the comments I've

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:38.200
seen or theories on it is they got tired of e3 being kind of a pissing contest of

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:45.100
who who's flashier who's you know doing bigger things and stuff like that and so

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:50.160
now they weren't getting business done and they're just you know it's a kind of

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.400
a waste of time for them whereas I don't know like something like packs they have

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.160
people that are interested in their product they can you know it's their

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.440
target audience I guess and they're still getting the press releases out

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.200
there and also now that they've figured out that they can do these gamer days

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.840
and no press events like that was my thought exactly it the whole press comes

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.200
out for gamers day at the all these gamers day stuff why why bother anything

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.080
well you know what I mean bastards of the elite press that we didn't get

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.800
invited to e3 either so you know whatever but they they get into these

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.520
things so why bother with e3 and exactly and it doesn't really matter the press

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.040
gets to see this stuff anyways cuz a lot of times they're just saying them

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.000
pre-release copies of these games anyways it really unfortunately press

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.840
isn't working the way it used to before where you know people are actually

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.600
reporting on things now they're working closely with these game companies and

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.920
the game companies are telling them how to report stuff and they're you know

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.280
going back and forth and making deals and that kind of thing it's really all

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.760
they're kind of like the press is in their pocket type thing nowadays but

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.960
does everybody wants to break exclusives yes everyone everyone wants their

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.760
exclusives and and fortunately we as we found out the hard way you know that

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.720
goes to the people that can make the you know deals say hey I'll tell you what

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.680
we'll give you a premium advertising for your game on our website if we can break

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.720
this exclusive on the story and and they will just literally you know tell you

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.280
one thing oh yeah everyone's gonna get the story at the same time and just boof

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.040
it gets you know out there and they're like oh well sorry I thought everyone's

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:30.280
on the same page about this kind of stuff really right it's it's just you

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:36.240
know they follow the money well they are business people so I would love to see

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.680
an underground blog come out that just outs all these things you know what I

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:48.280
mean before the company's buy-in if it's possible it might be I don't know I

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:54.640
don't know got the comments from chats shadow Charlie simply says fuck e3 we do

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.280
says e3 was a sensation that grew too out of control I don't know I would

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.360
think maybe some people kind of miss the glam that comes with e3 because boy that

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.840
show got a lot of press coverage a lot a lot of press coverage and now the tone

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.080
down one not quite as much you know maybe amongst the hardcore gamers sure

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:19.960
but amongst the general public not so much I don't know and I and they're like

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.680
saying I know their excuses that we've heard before we're just like oh it's

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.880
hard you know for us to make demos and stuff for for these events and it really

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.720
interferes with our production schedules and stuff like that I haven't really

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.920
noticed an issue over the last like 10 years or whatever that you know these

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.920
have been you know probably even longer that these have been going on so I think

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.680
that's just an excuse I think they're just looking the ways to save money

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.680
because nowadays I don't know if they're not making as much money or maybe the

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.480
margins are smaller but cutting costs any way they can and a glamorous event

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.200
like e3 that's definitely inexpensive they can probably do without well guess

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:02.720
what Activision Vivendi are not the only ones who have decided to skip e3 this

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.680
year that's what makes the story even more interesting and see soft foundation

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:13.280
9 and Atlas have all also opted out of this year's e3 this has been confirmed

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:20.240
by other attendees as well kind of interesting foundation 9 game spotters

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.040
reported foundation 9 is out because quote we just didn't feel like we got

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.520
enough out of the investment last year in order to justify the expense this

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.200
year that is telling me that sounds like a quote where somebody sounds like they

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.880
miss is the old e3 not getting enough exposure whereas the old e3 was all

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.560
about you know yes it was a little bit sensationalistic but think about all of

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.560
that exposure yes you had people at e3 that may may or may not have been there

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.000
but they get the word out and they're they're loving all the stuff they see

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.920
because it's e3 everybody's pumped every game you play is awesome what they've

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.640
changed from you know years past they've gotten rid of like the Kenshia Hall

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.280
where you had all the independent game companies and stuff down there were

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.040
people you know after they visit all the other booths and stuff they just go down

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.120
there and check out a lot of these games that don't normally get press you'll see

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.760
a lot of stuff down there that's pretty amazing that will eventually get picked

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.500
up by a company and stuff and if they would get a lot of foot traffic a lot

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.060
more than they would get you know if they just had a booth at this new e3 you

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:22.520
know because from what I heard there was you know obviously before there was a

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.200
lot of traveling in between hotels and stuff like that a lot of more of a

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.320
strict schedule so it's a lot less time to kind of explore it at your own pace and

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.440
that probably also the decreased foot traffic kind of hurt them a little bit

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.200
because when you have a lot of stories to cover and stuff a lot of the

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.320
independent media doesn't get to cover these you know smaller companies and

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.720
that kind of sucks.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:49.520
Alright well also some other speculation going on around the internet about

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.680
exactly why this is all going down this week which is probably the biggest thing

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.400
to happen this week. Kotaku managed to get the organizer of the Penny Arcade

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:04.320
Expo to comment on this. This is from Robert Koo who's the director of

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.000
business development for the Penny Arcade Expo quote, the reason that E3 imploded

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.080
in recent years was because the publishers felt that it turned into this

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.720
sort of pissing contest between them where they were trying to figure out who

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.960
could one-up each other.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.640
They all thought to themselves that it just wasn't worth it. I would imagine

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.240
that the show is still trying to look out for what the publishers want. That's

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.440
the whole goal of the trade association which is to deliver the needs and try to

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:33.240
figure out what their members actually want. So there you have it. More

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.840
speculation as to why E3 may be shrinking. It's going to be very

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.680
interesting to see what happens in kind of the coming weeks as more you know

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.840
kind of gets out. I'm curious if this is going to be the start of a mass

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.760
exodus or what's going to happen. You may see that because member E4all, same

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.280
kind of thing happened there with big companies saying oh we're not

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.360
going to be a part of this. Microsoft and Sony both pulled out of that didn't they? I think so

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.400
yeah. You think these companies might go to E4all instead? No. I don't think

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.360
they will. I think they'll do their own because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.960
don't really need these kind of events anyways because they have their own big

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:13.360
events. In fact one we'll be talking about in some last minute stories, the

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.240
PlayStation day. They invite the press out for that kind of stuff and I

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.520
know Microsoft has their own conference and same with Nintendo so there's really

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:28.600
no reason that they need to be a part of E3. I mean especially if it's going to

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.440
cost them a lot more money. I'm sure they would like the press for it and stuff

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.840
but I don't know. I still miss the I would hate it if they didn't you know

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.360
show up because I miss their press conferences. That's my favorite part you

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.720
know hearing all their cool new things. Although Nintendo last year is kind of

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:51.520
disappointing with those we zapper and we wheel dumb ideas but whatever. Anywho

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.760
back on a different subject here. Prince of Persia. Well we talked a little bit a

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.280
few weeks ago that there was gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:11.040
out. The brand new game is I guess gonna be just called Prince of Persia and not

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.040
some sort of Prince of Persia prodigy or whatever but it's scheduled to be

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:22.360
released on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It will be a prequel to the previous Prince

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.800
of Persia series and I believe is gonna be a trilogy as well so it's supposed to

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:35.400
introduce I guess an illustrative art style and I guess the DS is also getting

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.480
their own Prince of Persia game but it's gonna be exclusive to that console and

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:47.360
will be its own unique storyline. So pretty cool hmm and they actually I

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:59.160
found I think I found some scans there was a magazine was it it was a joy pad

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.960
it's a magazine that had some pictures and it looks pretty cool actually it's

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:12.560
like almost not really cel-shaded but sort of I don't know how I would really

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.200
describe that. What do you think about this Rob here real quick and I'll link the

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:24.520
chat room to these scans as well. It's you know I'm not surprised that Prince of

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.160
Persia continuing especially you know they have this movie coming out I'm a

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.360
little bit surprised they're kind of relaunching it as a you know kind of

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.760
spin-off series or what have you but you know if they're gonna do that that's

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.720
probably why they're trying to change the look of it and everything so why not

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.280
Prince of Persia has always been a solid game I think the best way to describe it

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.880
Prince of Persia series is very solid line of games so you know what the heck

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.720
but that's an interesting art style I think oh yeah looks like like Okami ish

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.560
I don't know yeah I guess it would be like a cross between Okami and say like

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:57.660
I don't know just like a normal like action game it's like I don't know it's

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:02.120
really hard to describe it it's a 3d game with like inclines on the outside I

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:07.840
guess anyways I'll link it in the chat room it's on a website action trip calm

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.720
so all right well in other news clock tower you remember this game long time

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.120
ago it was out on the PlayStation can you describe what happened in clock

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.920
tower you were a girl I don't remember the specifics of it I guess she got like

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.800
locked into a towers or I know it was like a house or something a mansion and

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.680
basically the objective was for you to hide from this like crazy huge scissor

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:40.280
welding guy and he would like you would be walking around like the rooms inside

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.040
of the mansion or whatever and he would hear like music or your heartbeat I

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.440
don't remember exactly I played it a long time ago but you would know somehow

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.840
that he was coming so you had to like hide from him and then he would come

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.840
through and like it would be really tense because you don't know if he'd

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.440
find you or not because he kind of like he'd walk by he'd sometimes he'd like

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.040
look behind stuff or whatever and so that was kind of the big thing about it

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.200
I saw this game like one time this game was a trip from oh my god scary it's

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.080
almost scarier than like Silent Hill and some of those yeah no it's like it's

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.880
tense it was brutal too if he found you snap your head got cut off yeah that's

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.720
part of the whole tension of it is like oh crap he's gonna find me you know like

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.080
yeah but it was good it was good well they're making a movie out of it I

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.640
can't wait that's gonna be freaky variety is reported this and there's

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.600
been rumors of a clock tower movie for quite a long time what variety is

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.760
reported this week that senator entertainment is going to be producing

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.120
it Weinstein company is putting it out you know that's they used home your max

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.540
and all that stuff the guy who wrote borderland Eric poppin is writing the

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:48.080
script the folks who produced the hills have eyes to producing this I don't know

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.960
so much about that Marco Weber and Martin wise so it should be it sounds

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.360
like it'll be at least if nothing else what a good horror film you know like

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:03.320
the kind of like a cheap cheesy film you know I want it to have some substance in

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.720
it you know like I yeah even though it is a video game movie like I don't I

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.280
want them to actually do something with it all right we'll see what happens well

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.160
you know because this week was so big with a grand theft auto 4 people were

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.080
wondering well where is the PC version of the game and like you may remember

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:29.160
with the other ones it was a while after you know they came out that the PC

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:37.040
version finally made its way to the market of course rockstar is doing the

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:43.560
old no comment thing on the Grand Theft Auto for PC version but more than

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.240
likely it probably around at some point people are hoping that maybe by this

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.880
holiday will see it on the PC I don't see why they wouldn't mean that's more

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.480
sales for them and especially I imagine the PC version probably look a little

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:02.780
bit better to especially on some high-end pcs but there are some

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:08.120
publishers though they're still listing the game as being released on October

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:16.360
30th 2008 of course you know take two or rockstar has not announced the release

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.760
of that game or even the existence of the game so I don't know if it's any

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:27.960
consolation though the last three PC releases for Grand Theft Auto 3 Vice

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:33.340
City and San Andreas were all pretty quiet too so maybe there's a

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:38.360
possibility although I don't know if three was on the PC wasn't it oh yeah

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.360
Vice City was Vice City and actually I think three may have been on the PC I

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.800
don't remember but I know Vice City and San Andreas were all right well guess

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:55.480
what I've got for you guys here before we get to the end of part a yes it's

01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:02.360
another stupid award for the week sadly this week it's it's not so gruesome I

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.240
guess it's actually good things we don't actually like people dying but this is

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:13.160
very stupid nonetheless happened in San Diego 27 year old robbed a GameStop he

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.220
actually pepper sprayed two employees and stole launch day copies of Grand

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:26.120
Theft Auto 4 however as the person who actually robbed the store Richard feel

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.940
is his name they actually have a little picture of him on the internet in the

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.360
back of the police car he found that real life is a little bit harder than

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.720
Grand Theft Auto because police actually found a copy of Grand Theft Auto they

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.520
they got him and they found a copy of Grand Theft Auto 3 and a PlayStation 3

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.440
controller in his pickup truck along with the stolen copy of Grand Theft Auto

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:50.880
4 here's the police department commented to the local NBC affiliate in San Diego

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.360
the call came out as a robbery of a commercial business and the suspect was

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.320
described in the vehicle truck that he got into was described as a white

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.040
Toyota pickup truck lifted with the tailgate down and our helicopter Abel

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:10.680
spotted the vehicle southbound the officers followed it so that was it no

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:21.440
word on how many stars he accumulated a comment from chat alpha canagram says I

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.920
bet Lord Voldemort paid that dude to do it of course load Lord Voldemort is our

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:36.880
other name for you know who probably paid him to do it anyhow if you're gonna

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.320
steal a game we just shouldn't steal a game stealing games is stupid it's been

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.920
he stole one game

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:51.720
it's just funny no you shouldn't steal at all it's it's very bad when you steal

01:17:51.720 --> 01:18:01.560
hey we're gonna get somebody on the line here to do something special for you at the very very end of part a of our podcast because you know what happens at the end of part a of our show all the

tonight with not much gaming news and you know it's there's always a segment

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.000
that we do this part of the show so we had to bring you here to give us your

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
classic game of the week

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.960
your part of the show where we pay respect to our elders in gaming with

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.600
Jamie picking out a game from the long lost archives of games that folks should

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.920
really check out this week so Jamie what did you pick for the kids tonight I

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.800
picked out nothing that was obscure or crazy or weird or anything I picked out super mario brothers 3

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:14.520
why not a true classic one of my favorite games when it came out I went

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.960
completely crazy it was the only reason that I would see the other wizard to

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:26.160
begin with the game you know it was you know what super mario brothers 2 was

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.640
over here wasn't really super mario brothers 2 super mario brothers 2 was

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.960
more like the original was more like a rehash of the first game whereas 3

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:40.160
actually did some real innovations by having your different worlds different

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:53.280
things like that the whole point of it is the whole point was that formula that

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.960
everyone had become accustomed to and then blew it up really big so it was really cool

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:09.640
you had different worlds you had world 1 was grassland, world 2 was desert, 3 was seaside, 4 was big island, 5 was the sky

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:17.720
6 was iceland, 7 was pitanese, and 8 was castle kubak

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:25.360
each world had you know different maps that would go along with the theme of

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.520
whatever that world was but you also had different little mini fortresses that

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:34.760
you had to go through and then you had your primary thoughts with different ways of

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.960
beating them although a lot of them were just like a certain type of a different

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:45.360
pattern would fit like different ones those three I remember the bosses the

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.480
bosses were all pretty easy if you just keep stomping on their heads repeatedly

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.480
and don't let him get don't let him get any moves on you well now remember you

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.960
have the ones that were on the rocking platform oh that's true and then you

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.880
have and then you have the ones that were in the room that would shrink I

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:06.480
guess as long as you kept up your pattern it was easy

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:15.120
oh we have some boss model music in here well for the fortress music and this

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.720
you know what made this game super famous here's what I remember about

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.360
Super Mario Bros 3 this will always be my not only I believe is this the best

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.000
selling video game ever which makes it a true classic but this was the game that

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.360
was not originally packaged with the system oh that okay the way oh yeah

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.480
because obviously you know you have Super Mario Brothers is the pack and of

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.840
course that's gonna sell more technicality I remember this game for

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:48.920
being featured in the movie the wizard I think that was the motivation for a lot

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:56.080
of us was to see like the first sneak peek at Super Mario Bros 3 remember the

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.160
guy introducing it in the movie he made it sound all like holy it's great and

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.640
now we're like yeah but the other thing that I thought was really cool about

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.880
that he was a different power-ups that you would get you had your usual

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.720
mushroom you had your fire flower but you also had the raccoon tail that you

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:21.960
could get that was always like my favorite to have ever you had your you

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:28.320
know your power stars we had you know all your other mushrooms the Tennessee

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.320
suit was fantastic because you could also turn into the monk statue and the

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.400
enemy who just ignore you for a little bit except you really didn't do that on

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.800
the donut level you don't anybody donut level where you'd run over the little

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.400
donuts and they would fall you can get on that level could you die but the

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.440
other cool thing about the Trinity students if you turn into the statue

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.320
while you're airborne you'll land on something and it'll kill it and it's

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:55.680
great you also get the peeling which was there's actually two items as a peeling

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:01.840
or an anchor and you get this out of some of the toad houses and it's like if

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:07.520
you collect a certain number of coins on even number world you would get the

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:14.240
anchor if you did it on the odd world and you would get a peeling or maybe

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:20.080
through the way around anyway so yeah it was that way um also on a couple of the

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:25.560
places you could get a hammer brother suit you could go hammers and there was

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:34.000
one fire brother that would um but you uh I'm being scared out by my husband

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.760
then says the anchor was worthless however to shoot rock the anchor was

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.400
worthless you know what I will tell you though you want piss me off about

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:49.680
power-ups Jamie okay go ahead that's why I was gonna say no no not just the fact

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.680
that it was there but what pissed me off you can only use that damn shoe in one

01:23:52.680 --> 01:24:05.600
level I know you know what they should go ahead they should make a game for the

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.560
Wii called kuriboh shoe everybody would buy it that would be great well there

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.240
were some different levels between the American and Japanese version some were

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:23.640
changed for matters of just copy did it cause the game to glitch like in world

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:27.960
five there was in five one if you would have to go to a pipe to get to where the

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.640
screen goes black and white and it would actually cause the game to glitch up

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.720
pretty bad um also if you got hit in the Japanese version no matter what power

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:43.320
if you had you would go back to being small if whereas in the American one you

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.080
would just go to being super and then to be small except with the kuriboh shoe

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.960
which was you'd go back to being small in Japanese version but in American one

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.840
you just go back to whatever power-up you had then to super and then to small

01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:05.800
and the music of the game was done by Koji Kondo who I got to meet and he's a

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:13.720
guy yeah and there were remakes there was the Satellaview version for Super

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.880
Famicom which is basically the enhanced version that looked like Super Mario All

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.440
Stars which again was another version and actually Super Mario All Stars had

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.000
the version that came out actually retained some of the stuff that was in

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.920
the Japanese version and not in the u.s. one we also got Super Mario Advance 4

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.640
Super Mario 3 which was pretty cool and had stuff added and you know I did spice

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:44.600
it up a little bit and that one was developed by Nintendo R&B 2 pretty cool

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.000
there were e-reader extra levels that would extend the game but they were

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.240
really convoluted and hard to do so it was like people just said I screw it and

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.960
didn't bother I don't even remember that they had Super Mario Brothers 3d the

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.960
Walmart cards and some that came with the game with might with Super Mario

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.360
Advance 4 that the extensions were for the advanced version but you had to have

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:17.360
the e-reader 2 GBAs a link cable and the card you wanted and you would hook up

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:25.400
the GBA with the cartridge and the connector will go in the e-reader and

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.680
then you would do all this convoluted crap and it was a big pain in the ass

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.120
and not I mean the levels were cool and it really opened up I think a lot of

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.720
potential to have you know almost infinite playability as long as people

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.240
are willing to put up with the crap you had to do to use the e-reader but other

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.760
than that you know of course the whole e-reader thing sort of died out once

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.000
they started upgrading the hardware very interesting very interesting comment

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.080
from Rama in chat Nintendo give us Super Mario Brothers 4 you know we never

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.920
really have had just a plain Super Mario Brothers games since Super Mario

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.000
Brothers 3 I mean sure there's been Mario World there's been countless other

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.960
games have had Mario in it but there's never ever been a Super Mario Brothers

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:29.920
4 I guess so but it was also you know down to the world down to powerups down

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.440
to all the specials and actually if I do remember right I think that you the

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:41.560
Super Mario World feather was actually the power-up and you could use that as

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:47.240
a power-up in Mario and Mario for advanced but I really think the world

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.400
could be considered I think it's just as they decided to stop numbering them

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.160
because it would get ridiculous and then fall into you know street fighter

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.840
formula true and hit stem points out that you also have the one on the DS that

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.560
really really if anything was like the closest thing we've had to Mario 3 in a

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:06.320
long time you know I mean that was oh yeah new Super Mario Brothers about

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.520
Mario advanced so yeah one four but yeah we didn't have that I guess and mean the

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.440
Mario and we had a lost levels not lost levels but the all-stars all right well

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:23.200
any other thoughts on the Super Mario Brothers 3 it was fun and I'm gonna

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.560
break out my my top loading Nintendo soon and play the hell out of it when I

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.520
don't feel like I'm gonna fall over and I just don't use whistles because you

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:38.160
know that's cheating no it's not cheating we are going to have a

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.560
discussion right here right now about using the work with those it's not

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:48.560
cheating it for a reason I know it's okay into the game it's not cheating but

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:55.280
you've got to admit so much more fun to play without warping you you don't get

01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:01.280
to play big world if you war big world is the bomb I agree with that but you

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:05.040
can work to get ahead to get right to big you know you can go right there

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:13.560
that's only half cheating okay okay it was programmed into the game for a

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.360
reason and you know what you know what I had the same argument with people who

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.320
say oh you can't use speed ups on DDR either of like okay go back and play

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.200
beat mania without you know speed up it wasn't in the original all right fine

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:33.360
warp all you want but I want big world and the level with curry boshu they'll

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.320
program more all right all right Jamie we got to wrap up part a so we get to

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.320
very passionate about that game but it is it is probably one of like the best

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.480
games of all time I mean you can't deny that I absolutely can I absolutely yeah

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.600
