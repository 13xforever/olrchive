7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.
14000	18000	Tonight, May 25th, 2008. Is Killer Instinct going to make a comeback?
18000	21000	A new computer chip promises to end piracy forever.
21000	25000	And will the 360 go without an update this spring?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	43000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	50000	And yeah, we were out last week so we didn't have a show and part B from the week before took forever to get to the podcast feed.
50000	54000	But it's all better now, all better. We're fixed and ready to go.
54000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'm ready to go tonight.
57000	61000	Hopefully the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also ready to go tonight.
61000	62000	Hi.
62000	65000	Are you well oiled and ready to go?
65000	67000	You know, like a machine.
67000	69000	I've had a hamburger, does that count?
69000	70000	Sure, that works.
70000	72000	Okay, then I'm well greased and ready to go to the bathroom.
72000	74000	Alright, sounds not hot.
74000	78000	Alright, also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
78000	79000	Hello.
79000	81000	And are you well oiled and ready to go?
81000	82000	Uh, sure.
82000	87000	Alright, you had a Subway sandwich earlier, so I know. How long was that Subway sandwich?
87000	89000	That was like a two foot long sandwich.
89000	94000	It was a foot long, okay, and it was with the wrong bread because apparently this Subway was out of white bread.
94000	96000	That sandwich was bigger than my foot.
96000	99000	That was not a foot long sandwich, that was a foot long sandwich.
99000	101000	Alright, anyhow, sorry.
101000	104000	We are turning into Orange Lounge Foodio yet again.
104000	111000	Alright, joining us as well in studio, we have some guests tonight, which is good because we haven't had a lot of guests recently.
111000	114000	And I've had to suffer this entire show with only Jamie and Matt.
114000	118000	However, we have some guests tonight to help break that up a little bit.
118000	123000	Joining us all the way from Las Vegas is Tiara.
123000	124000	How are you?
124000	126000	I can has American cheeseburger.
126000	129000	Yes, you can has American cheeseburger. How are you doing?
129000	134000	I am very good. I got nauseous on the way here, but now I'm fine.
134000	138000	Sorry to hear that. You are very, very quiet. They're having a hard time hearing you, so don't be afraid to get that thing real close to your mouth.
138000	141000	Because remember, it's normally wired for Jamie, who can get kind of loud.
141000	143000	Alright, yeah, that's right.
143000	144000	I'm just teasing.
144000	149000	Alright, well we're glad to have you. So you feel free to chime in whenever. Take Jamie's mic, I encourage it.
149000	150000	Okay.
150000	151000	Just kidding.
151000	154000	I don't know why I'm giving Jamie a hard time tonight. I heart Jamie. She knows that.
154000	156000	Right, you know that?
156000	158000	I'm going to throw that ferret in the fire.
158000	162000	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Drewnami.
162000	163000	Rawr.
163000	164000	How are you doing, Drew?
164000	165000	I'm Rawr.
165000	166000	You're Rawr?
166000	167000	Rawr.
167000	170000	I like the interactive radio that was going on before the show, by the way.
170000	182000	Here's what happened. We're live on Justin TV. We do our cam thing, although I got to tell you, the cam kind of sucks tonight because I dropped the iSight webcam and the audio doesn't work anymore.
182000	183000	It's not breaking it, Drew.
183000	193000	Yeah, it's having to use the actual audio from that little tiny mic thing on the actual, like if you look at the right side of the Mac, but you can see the little tiny mic thing, that's what it's using.
193000	195000	So our Justin TV is kind of hurting tonight.
195000	200000	But I guess one of our listeners actually saw that you were here and called your phone and got you to leave the room.
200000	205000	Ranma, you fucking suck. I just like to make that known.
205000	212000	But Orange Launch Radio is interactive radio. It's the best thing ever because we get to interact with you guys. We love it.
212000	218000	And you can join us in chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, or our chat channel is Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.
218000	221000	Or you can always send us emails, mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com.
221000	226000	I think we have a pretty full mailbag tonight, though, because it's been two weeks, so you may not want to send them just yet.
226000	228000	Wait till during the week.
228000	233000	And also our Skype line, which will be open later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
233000	237000	But it would not be Orange Lounge Radio if we didn't talk about our gaming week.
237000	242000	And since we've got some time to catch up on, tonight's question is how is your gaming two weeks?
242000	244000	So Dark Sakura, how is your gaming two weeks?
244000	256000	We played Rock Band today, and I played pinball a lot. I went to Pin-A-Go-Go the weekend before.
256000	259000	How was Pin-A-Go-Go? Because we didn't get to hear about it because we were out that week.
259000	265000	It was hot, smelly, and hot. And smelly.
265000	267000	Do pinball players not bathe or something?
267000	274000	I don't know, but this was at Dixon Farm Center of something or the other with Banquet Hall.
274000	279000	Yeah, when most people call Sacramento a cow town, you're actually probably thinking of Dixon.
279000	280000	Yeah.
280000	281000	Moo.
281000	294000	Anyway, but I did get to play the Black Rose before it went down, and Dan brought his No Fear, and Will brought Judge Dredd, which is not my favorite table.
294000	304000	But anyway, I really played. I tried to go back and play some really old stuff and some things I hadn't seen before, but I could not get on Theater of Magic at all.
304000	308000	And no one brought like a medieval madness. There was an Addams Family there.
308000	309000	Nice.
309000	315000	But it was by this point, it's a lot of machines that I know if I want to play them, we know the people who own them.
315000	323000	So what exactly happens at Pin-A-Go-Go? You pay money to get in and just play all the pinball you want, or is it more of like it's supposed to be like a trade show for pinball enthusiasts?
323000	328000	You've got your center area, which is all, in fact, there's actually two rooms.
328000	335000	The main room is where the newer tables are set up, the one with more, you know, I guess componentry and things.
335000	340000	And then there's an air conditioned dining hall that has older machines set up in there.
340000	347000	And I'm talking like, you know, 60s, you know, 50s, 60s, 70s machines.
347000	354000	But you basically, they're all put on free play and you pay your convention dues and you run around and, you know.
354000	355000	Frolick.
355000	356000	Frolick in the hot.
356000	357000	Play pinball.
357000	360000	But around the sides they have vendors set up.
360000	368000	People who sell, you know, old tables that need some work, like a friend of ours got a Space Invaders pinball.
368000	369000	Nice.
369000	372000	For like 150 bucks. It needs to be shopped really bad.
372000	374000	Does it have the groovy music from the new soundtrack?
374000	375000	I don't know.
375000	376000	It should.
376000	377000	Probably not.
377000	378000	It's old.
378000	379000	Oh, probably not then.
379000	382000	And creepy looking too.
382000	384000	There are a couple of machines I did play quite a bit of.
384000	386000	Did they have the Jurassic Park pinball?
386000	389000	That was one of my favorites because the dinosaur would come down and eat the ball.
389000	390000	No.
390000	391000	That was always my favorite.
391000	394000	It had a fun house, which I hate because that head scares me.
394000	397000	But it had Captain Fantastic.
397000	398000	Captain Fantastic.
398000	400000	Which is the one with Elton John on it.
400000	402000	That was the machine in Tommy.
402000	404000	Oh yeah, he's fantastic, alright.
404000	406000	I have a picture of it. I'll put it on the camera.
406000	407000	Fantastic.
407000	411000	But I did play, one of my favorite was Black Hole.
411000	417000	Which, the cool thing about Black Hole is that you have an underside that you play under the field and you play it reversed.
417000	419000	Oh, I've seen something like that.
419000	424000	I don't think it was, I think it was like, isn't there a swamp thing or a creature from the swamp or something like that?
424000	425000	An Elvira machine does it.
425000	426000	Okay, okay.
426000	432000	But Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is what's in my house, just has a hologram of the creature.
432000	434000	Okay, no, I'm thinking of something else. Alright, that's fine.
434000	438000	But, um, Black Hole is a pretty, pretty nifty machine.
438000	442000	But, um, Dan finally got to play Black Rose, which is the one I want.
442000	445000	Which I think is much cooler than the new Pirates of the Caribbean game.
445000	446000	Which was there.
446000	450000	And Family Guy and Simpsons Pinball Party, which I have.
450000	452000	And no pin bot.
452000	453000	You know what?
453000	454000	There's a bride.
454000	456000	You know what pinball game I haven't played in forever that I want to play again?
456000	457000	Well.
457000	458000	Revenge of the Gator.
458000	460000	That was the Game Boy one.
460000	461000	I know.
461000	463000	That was the first game I ever played with the link cable.
463000	464000	That one was fantabulous.
464000	465000	It was fantabulous.
465000	474000	But it was, overall it was a really good convention, but we ended up splitting so that we could go to, um, Mary's Pizza Shack.
474000	475000	Nice.
475000	476000	Where we didn't eat pizza.
476000	477000	We ate breadsticks.
477000	478000	And I had a milkshake.
478000	479000	The end.
479000	480000	Alright.
480000	483000	Loki, how was your gaming two weeks?
483000	492000	Um, well, week one I played pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto IV, because I was attempting to go for 100% by that deadline.
492000	501000	And, not to say that I didn't try, because I took two days off work, played solid for four days, and still didn't finish it in time.
501000	506000	Um, it just got to the point where it wasn't even fun to play it anymore.
506000	511000	It's fun to play it now though, but not fun to just do all the side missions and stuff.
511000	513000	And I'm still going to do 100% eventually.
513000	516000	It's just, you know, right now I'm like at 86.
516000	519000	So, I have to kill all the pigeons.
519000	522000	And do stunts and stuff like that.
522000	527000	Uh, then I played a little bit of, um, Wii Fit this week.
527000	528000	And that's alright.
528000	532000	You know, the balance board, it's not as fun as you would think it would be.
532000	535000	It really, it, I don't know.
535000	539000	It's just kind of stupid, some of the games that are on there.
539000	541000	And they're not really responsive.
541000	543000	But, whatever.
543000	551000	And then, um, I tried a little bit of, um, the Penny Arcade game.
551000	552000	And that was pretty fun.
552000	555000	Wait, I have to ask, when you got on the balance board, did it go, ow!
555000	557000	No, it didn't go, ow.
557000	559000	It's all, you're obese.
559000	562000	Did your wife make fun of you? Was she watching you play?
562000	565000	No, she was watching me play with you.
565000	567000	It was just fun.
567000	571000	Um, but then, you know, the, uh, it said my Wii Fit age was 38.
571000	574000	So, I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
574000	578000	Um, tried, like, a bunch of the mini games on there.
578000	580000	Like, the jogging and stuff.
580000	586000	There's, um, apparently, uh, Xtifer and my wife said that, um,
586000	591000	the female trainer on there has a giant bulge.
591000	593000	Like, she's got a package.
593000	594000	What?
594000	601000	Yeah, apparently the female trainer is carrying, uh, some extra, uh, equipment.
601000	603000	I don't know. Kind of weird stuff there.
603000	607000	But, um, yeah, pretty much that was my gaming week.
607000	609000	Because that's all I've been really playing.
609000	611000	Um, multiplayer's still kind of fun.
611000	615000	It's hit and miss, though, with the accuracy on it.
615000	618000	Because, you know, you'll be aiming at someone's head.
618000	622000	And, for whatever reason, it really favors if you crouch down when you're firing and stuff.
622000	624000	I don't know. It's just kind of cheap.
624000	626000	It's not as fun as you would have hoped it.
626000	628000	But it's not as broken as the PSP version.
628000	630000	So, that's also fun.
630000	634000	Um, but, yeah, that's pretty much it right now.
634000	639000	I'm still trying to get my audio video set up to work so I can, um, record some funny stuff.
639000	642000	Because I was, um, I was doing some...
642000	646000	We were playing with some people and there's a, you know, a bunch of skate parks in there.
646000	650000	And you can take the motorcycles on the half pipes and stuff and do funny things with that.
650000	653000	Um, just all sorts of weird stuff.
655000	658000	Well, my gaming week, um, you know, I was kind of sick last week.
658000	661000	Which you would think I would stay home and play games all day, but I really didn't.
661000	663000	Although, I did, um, you know, it's...
663000	665000	Gosh, it's been a while since we've had a show.
665000	666000	I mean, you miss a week, miss a lot.
666000	668000	Because we haven't done a show since WiiWare came out.
668000	671000	Like, that was, like, our last show was, what, May 11th?
671000	674000	And so, literally the next day was when WiiWare came out.
674000	679000	So, I checked out Defend Your Castle because I'd played the Flash game a long time ago and I loved it.
679000	681000	So, I decided to get the version for the Wii.
681000	685000	And it's cute. Like, I love the graphics and the sound are hilarious.
685000	688000	Because, um, they made all the graphics out of really quirky things.
688000	692000	Like, um, for one of the battering rams that some of the guys try to use on your castle.
692000	695000	There's little popsicle sticks that they use as the art.
695000	698000	And, like, these giant monsters are made of Pepsi caps.
698000	701000	Like, the tops of, like, actual Pepsi bottles.
701000	703000	Which is, um, kind of funny.
703000	705000	So, um...
705000	708000	Yeah, so that was, uh, that was...
708000	711000	It was amusing. Defend Your Castle is very amusing.
711000	713000	It's very slow in the beginning.
713000	715000	Like, you kind of have to stick with it for it to get really chaotic.
715000	720000	And the kind of bummer thing about Defend Your Castle is that once you've kind of upgraded your castle fully,
720000	722000	there's not really a lot left to do.
722000	726000	You just have to let it keep getting faster and faster and faster.
726000	728000	But, it's only a $5 game.
728000	732000	And, you know, compared to some of the $5 stinkers on Xbox Live,
732000	735000	it's, it's, it's... $5 is a fair price for the game.
735000	738000	I think it would be a fun party game, too, and it's obscenely simple.
738000	741000	I mean, it's cool to bring friends over and be all,
741000	743000	okay, here's what you do, pick up the guys with your controller,
743000	745000	and then throw them up in the air and watch them die.
745000	747000	I mean, that's... What fun is that?
747000	749000	An instant party, just add death.
749000	751000	Uh, so, yeah, Defend Your Castle is kind of cool.
751000	755000	Um, it's not a game that's going to amuse you on a long-term basis.
755000	761000	So, though, if you're, if you're kind of like a single player looking for some games that are going to keep you involved for a long time,
761000	765000	from what I understand, you should probably go with Lost Winds or the, uh, Final Fantasy game.
765000	770000	Uh, neither of which I've checked out yet because I'm out of space on my Wii drive.
770000	771000	I, I know that.
771000	772000	Completely out of space.
772000	774000	It doesn't take much.
774000	776000	Jeez.
776000	779000	So, but anyway, I'll save that bitching for another day.
779000	783000	Uh, otherwise, I did check out the Penny Arcade game for a little bit.
783000	787000	I only checked out the demo, so I'm not going to try to give a full review of the game.
787000	790000	But I did laugh my ass off, like, I thought the game was very amusing.
790000	796000	The gameplay itself, you know, eh, I've seen it before, but I, I was amused.
796000	799000	And I'm sure fans of the comic are going to be insanely amused.
799000	802000	Um, I hear it's short, but you know what?
802000	805000	How much does it cost to see a movie these days?
805000	808000	Like, ten bucks to go see a movie for ninety minutes?
808000	812000	You know, it makes twenty dollars for four hours of entertainment not seem so bad.
812000	818000	So, you know, I, I'm sure this game is, I, I am going to put down the money to buy it when I have a little more time to actually sit down and play it.
818000	821000	Um, otherwise, I've just pretty much been playing WoW.
821000	824000	I have a friend who's trying very hard to get me to play Age of Conan.
824000	826000	But, from what I understand, it's still crashing.
826000	828000	Like, he's getting the blue screen of death when he's playing.
828000	832000	And I'm like, dude, I haven't heard of anyone getting the Windows blue screen of death in like five years.
832000	834000	So that's pretty hardcore.
834000	837000	Um, so I'll check that out once it gets a little more stable.
837000	839000	Because you remember when WoW first came out?
839000	840000	They had issues too.
840000	843000	I mean, WoW was shutting down systems left and right as well.
843000	845000	So, uh, yeah.
845000	846000	So that's that.
846000	851000	So, uh, otherwise, other games I've played, um, not a lot of new stuff.
851000	853000	I went back and played some old retro stuff.
853000	855000	Some old Xbox Live arcade games.
855000	856000	That's really it.
856000	860000	Um, Tiara, I see you're playing a PSP right now.
860000	861000	What are you, what are you up to?
861000	862000	How was your gaming weeks?
862000	863000	What have you been playing?
863000	867000	Um, well, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP.
867000	874000	It's kind of interesting because I've played the PSX version through so many times.
874000	878000	And it's interesting to see how they've rewritten, like, the script and everything.
878000	881000	Is it supposed to be, like, an upgrade of the original PlayStation 1?
881000	883000	Or is it, like, a whole new story?
883000	885000	Because I never really understood.
885000	888000	This one is the exact same game.
888000	891000	They've, uh, redone the translation.
891000	895000	And now everybody talks like Thor from Marvel Comics.
895000	896000	Okay.
896000	901000	And, um, they have, like, some of the cut scenes are now animated.
901000	903000	So it's, you know, it's kind of interesting.
903000	904000	Cool.
904000	905000	Those cameos.
905000	906000	Yes.
906000	909000	And, um, there are two new classes that you can get.
909000	911000	Onion Knight and Dark Knight.
911000	914000	And so it's been pretty interesting so far.
914000	915000	I'm only in the third chapter.
915000	918000	But so far everything is pretty much the same.
918000	919000	The translation is slightly different.
919000	923000	And so since the text is different, I'm sort of thrown off by it.
923000	927000	Because I'm so used to seeing the cheesy, uh, old translation.
927000	930000	That was like when I played Final Fantasy IV on the Game Boy Advance for the first time.
930000	934000	I was like, whoa, whoa, this is way different from what I remember on Super Nintendo.
934000	935000	Yeah.
935000	937000	Because they really dumbed it down on Super Nintendo.
937000	939000	But thank heavens they kept you Spoonie Bard in there.
939000	940000	Yeah.
940000	943000	I was like, I had to play at least to that spot to see, like, did they keep Spoonie Bard?
943000	944000	Yes?
944000	945000	Okay.
945000	946000	Yeah.
946000	949000	Other than that, um, I bought myself Iron Man for the PSP.
949000	951000	And I've been playing that a little bit.
951000	953000	I actually wrote a review for that.
953000	954000	And it's in the mailbag.
954000	955000	So I'm sure Jamie will read it later.
955000	956000	Nice.
956000	959000	And other than that, that's it.
959000	960000	All right.
960000	963000	I notice your PSP is very shiny, by the way.
963000	965000	You take good care of that PSP, don't you?
965000	967000	You, like, you sign on that or something.
967000	969000	It's very, very well kept.
969000	971000	Yeah, it's, well, I just got it last month.
971000	972000	That's why.
972000	973000	Ah, okay.
973000	979000	Because, um, it was, uh, like a kind of preemptive tax refund gift to myself.
979000	981000	Like, I know the government's giving me $600, so why not?
981000	982000	Yeah.
982000	983000	Exactly.
983000	984000	And then I have, like, my little shield on it.
984000	987000	And so it's, you know, that's why it's shiny.
987000	988000	Very nice.
988000	989000	Isn't it shiny?
989000	990000	Yes.
990000	991000	That's one thing I noticed about the PSP.
991000	992000	All right.
992000	993000	It's shiny.
993000	994000	Shiny.
994000	995000	All right.
995000	997000	Drew, anything shiny in your gaming week?
997000	998000	Not particularly.
998000	1001000	I've been playing, uh, well, I played some rock band today.
1001000	1004000	Did okay, I think.
1004000	1007000	Um, other than that, not much.
1007000	1013000	I tinkered with La Mulana, but, uh, I guess I'm just that, not that hardcore anymore.
1013000	1014000	Okay.
1014000	1018000	Somebody needs to explain La Mulana with me because I know, I know we have tons of chatters
1018000	1021000	that are obsessed with this game and, like, have been trying to get me to play.
1021000	1022000	So sell me on La Mulana.
1022000	1023000	What's, what's so rad about it?
1023000	1030000	In a nutshell, it's like a recreation of an MSX game.
1030000	1031000	Obscenely difficult.
1031000	1034000	It's, uh, action adventure.
1034000	1040000	And basically the goal is you're like this Indiana Jones type archeologist, and you want
1040000	1048000	to, uh, discover all the secrets in the ancient city called La Mulana.
1048000	1050800	Unfortunately, almost everything is a trap.
1050800	1055800	It's not, I don't, it's not, uh, I want to be the guy hard, but it's, it's definitely
1055800	1056800	Battletoads hard.
1056800	1059380	That would be a great name for a game.
1059380	1063380	Everything is a trap.
1063380	1064520	I'm not sure how that works.
1064520	1068120	I'm not sure if that would be like, I don't know if you ever saw the movie cube like that
1068120	1069120	as a video game.
1069120	1071800	We were just discussing this earlier today.
1071800	1074400	Hypercube breaks my mind.
1074400	1075400	Everything is a trap.
1075400	1077600	It's a trap.
1077600	1078600	I like that.
1078600	1079600	That's a good name.
1079600	1081240	I like, I'm not sure.
1081240	1082240	Add that to our wishlist.
1082240	1083240	Well, I don't know.
1083240	1087240	I don't know if it's able to add to the OLR wishlist because I'm not sure what the game
1087240	1088800	is yet.
1088800	1089880	That's the point.
1089880	1090880	You don't know what it is.
1090880	1093880	Oh, because it's a trap.
1093880	1094880	Okay.
1094880	1095880	Okay.
1095880	1096880	Yeah.
1096880	1097880	Then I approve.
1097880	1098880	It can go on the OLR wishlist.
1098880	1099880	Oh my God.
1099880	1101760	I've actually been playing through Metal Gear Solid 2.
1101760	1106200	I sort of gave up on the game a couple of years ago cause I suck at stealth games and
1106200	1108960	now I find I'm actually progressing.
1108960	1113640	Maybe it's the fact that I'm now playing on very easy, but Raiden is not annoying as I
1113640	1116880	thought it would be.
1116880	1117880	It's kind of interesting.
1117880	1121160	Isn't it weird when you like rediscover games that were out like five years ago?
1121160	1122160	Yeah.
1122160	1123160	Yeah.
1123160	1128120	Like, or like 10 years ago in the case when I was really sick and I was at my parents,
1128120	1129680	I was playing Soul Blazer.
1129680	1130680	Oh God.
1130680	1131680	Soul Blazer is awesome.
1131680	1132680	Soul Blazer is awesome.
1132680	1135400	Soul Blazer needs to come to Virtual Console for reals.
1135400	1138240	Like I don't think this made our show roll tonight, but I understand there was a little,
1138240	1143360	there was a little bit of shenanigans on the internet this week because I guess Kotaku
1143360	1150960	had posted, we want this game, we want Soul Blazer to come to Virtual Console and somehow
1150960	1156640	that got reported like on like G4 as Soul Blazer is on Virtual Console.
1156640	1157640	That was kind of funny.
1157640	1160080	That was very funny, but I agree with the guy who wrote it.
1160080	1164600	Soul Blazer does need to come to Virtual Console as does Illusion of Gaia, as does Terranigma.
1164600	1167520	Thank you very much.
1167520	1172080	Are you going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4 at some point, Junami, and the 50 hour cut
1172080	1174080	scenes are supposed to be in the game?
1174080	1175080	Yeah.
1175080	1176080	If I can afford a PS3.
1176080	1177080	Are you going to be watching Metal Gear Solid?
1177080	1179400	I shouldn't, I shouldn't ask people if they're going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4.
1179400	1180880	It's just as are you going to be watching it?
1180880	1183240	No, I'll be busy watching Xenosaga.
1183240	1184240	Oh, okay.
1184240	1188360	Of course, then again, when Final Fantasy 13 comes out, I'm sure it's going to be no
1188360	1191120	different where you just, you're going to be watching it.
1191120	1193760	I'll, I'll stick to my Tales of games for now.
1193760	1197680	I'm stoked for the Tales of Symphonia sequel for Wii.
1197680	1201760	My roommate who occasionally gets into games, like he was like obsessed with Puzzle Quest
1201760	1203840	for a little while and stuff like that, he loves Final Fantasy.
1203840	1204840	He'll touch anything that says Final Fantasy.
1204840	1207920	He was just asking me the other day, when's Final Fantasy 13 coming out?
1207920	1209600	Because like apparently I know everything about video games.
1209600	1213160	I'm like, um, 2010, if you're lucky.
1213160	1216200	If you're in Japan, you might see it next year.
1216200	1217200	Yeah.
1217200	1218200	Anyhow.
1218200	1224000	All right, let's get to gaming news after we take care of some housekeeping tonight.
1224000	1227600	First off, sorry about last week, we weren't here and that, uh, we decided we were going
1227600	1232820	to put out part B of the May 11th show a little late just to kind of spread it out when we
1232820	1235400	realized there wasn't gonna be a show this next, last week.
1235400	1238560	But then it ended up getting out really, really late and that was my bad.
1238560	1239560	So sorry about that.
1239560	1243360	This is up now, parts A and B of last week's show.
1243360	1244880	Grand Theft Auto IV contest.
1244880	1250560	If you listen to last week's show, you know that SSJ 100 Matt won our nomination into
1250560	1252760	the finals for the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.
1252760	1254440	I don't know who won yet.
1254440	1258200	What I can tell you is that it was, it didn't end up being a public vote.
1258200	1260020	That's not how they did it.
1260020	1265060	Each show that participated got a vote in the competition.
1265060	1269360	So in other words, we got to vote for any show that wasn't our own, basically.
1269360	1274840	And so the show that gets the most votes, that listener will win the super duper rare
1274840	1276520	Xbox 360 elite.
1276520	1281760	I can tell you that after much deliberation, and the three of us did this last week because
1281760	1285660	we didn't have a show, we made our top three list independently and it was so funny because
1285660	1289160	everything was like all around the board.
1289160	1295120	Like I don't, I don't think any of us had like any similarities in our list whatsoever.
1295120	1300520	Like Dark Sakura, I think had the Chatterbox show on her list, and Loki had the one with
1300520	1302340	all the dick jokes on his list.
1302340	1303340	Which one was that?
1303340	1304340	Was that the platform nation one?
1304340	1305340	Why am I not surprised?
1305340	1306920	That's because it was the most like a Grand Theft Auto commercial.
1306920	1307920	No, no.
1307920	1308920	I know it was.
1308920	1309920	And what did I have?
1309920	1313840	I had, I had video game outsiders on my list.
1313840	1315060	I remember that.
1315060	1321800	But in the end, the only one that actually ended up on all three of our lists was the
1321800	1323000	All Games Interactive one.
1323000	1325200	So that's what we ended up voting for.
1325200	1330860	And I don't have the MP3 handy, but it's really great because what they did is they cropped
1330860	1333240	Mary Young, who's on that show.
1333240	1337920	I guess he was like, he was having one of those, I'm all alone on the radio.
1337920	1344000	Like did you ever see Wayne's World when Garth was all alone having to do the show?
1344000	1348300	I guess Mary Young was having one of those moments and somebody actually remixed it to
1348300	1351200	music and it's hilarious.
1351200	1356720	He's actually singing like, I am alone on the feed.
1356720	1357720	It was really funny.
1357720	1358720	Oh wait, look, I found it.
1358720	1359720	I found it.
1359720	1360720	Okay.
1360720	1361720	Here's the one we voted for to win.
1361720	1391560	All right, I'm not going to play the whole thing.
1391560	1394040	You can listen to their show if you want to hear the whole thing, but it was really funny.
1394040	1398360	So we voted for it, even though nowhere in there do they ever say it's All Games Interactive
1398360	1399360	or any of that.
1399360	1402400	And it really has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto, but it was funny.
1402400	1408240	You ever seen that movie Shocker right before the guy's head exploded?
1408240	1411840	I do know, I don't think we've gotten a single vote so far.
1411840	1412840	Poor Matt.
1412840	1417560	The problem is if it had been, see, we kind of got screwed by how they decided to do the
1417560	1420720	finals, which is fine because we didn't know how they were going to do it going into it.
1420720	1424920	We knew it could be anything, but with a public vote, at least we could have mobilized the
1424920	1425920	OL army.
1425920	1427260	And I think Matt would have done pretty well.
1427260	1432120	But the problem with having the other shows vote is I don't think they all listen to Orange
1432120	1433120	Lounge Radio.
1433120	1435920	I don't think they'll listen to the rules of the contest either because some of those
1435920	1438000	entries is like, what the fuck is that?
1438000	1439000	It's like a bumper.
1439000	1440000	It's not even like a fucking commercial.
1440000	1441000	No, but that's okay.
1441000	1442880	I mean, bumpers were supposed to be okay.
1442880	1443880	Okay.
1443880	1447820	But it's not, from what I understand, some shows did not get a lot of participation.
1447820	1450920	So I think they had to pick what they got.
1450920	1451920	Okay.
1451920	1452920	Well, people should listen.
1452920	1457200	It's supposed to be like a Grand Theft Auto commercial, not a fucking commercial for...
1457200	1458200	Wait.
1458200	1459200	This just in.
1459200	1462160	Apparently Bobby Black Wolf voted for our show to win.
1462160	1464360	So praise Bobby Black Wolf.
1464360	1465360	Wait.
1465360	1466360	No one listens.
1466360	1467360	What do you think this is?
1467360	1468360	The internet?
1468360	1469360	So we know at least Matt won't get last place.
1469360	1472040	But see, Bobby probably liked it because Bobby listens to our show.
1472040	1473360	So he got all the votes.
1473360	1474360	Got it.
1474360	1475360	Got it.
1475360	1476880	But I doubt the other shows are going to get it.
1476880	1478880	So we'll see.
1478880	1480760	All right.
1480760	1481760	Moving on, moving on.
1481760	1482760	Enough.
1482760	1483960	We'll let you know who actually wins next week.
1483960	1489360	I do want to give one more shout out to the All Games crew right now, because there's
1489360	1492560	a gal on there who I think we've all met, Jessica.
1492560	1494360	Have you guys met Jessica?
1494360	1497000	We've all met Jessica before, right?
1497000	1498000	I don't know.
1498000	1499880	I think she was there at E3 one year.
1499880	1502800	She's the pretty gal who reads the news and all that stuff on their show.
1502800	1503800	Well, that could be anybody.
1503800	1504800	Yeah.
1504800	1507680	But Jessica is cool.
1507680	1511880	And she actually apparently is like, OK, I did not even know this was going on.
1511880	1518280	But there's this website, Massify.com, where they're actually casting a horror movie online.
1518280	1519680	Like people made YouTube-ish videos.
1519680	1521480	I sound like you said a horror movie.
1521480	1523960	No, a horror movie online.
1523960	1525900	Well, Jessica was a finalist.
1525900	1527100	Her thing was so popular.
1527100	1530120	She was one of the top 20, one of the top 10 girls.
1530120	1532380	They had her do a screen test.
1532380	1533520	And now she's a finalist.
1533520	1537520	And if she wins this, she's going to be in a movie.
1537520	1539160	She's going to be in a horror movie.
1539160	1541960	She's going to be victim number how much?
1541960	1542960	I don't know.
1542960	1544880	Apparently, it's like a lead role if she wins this.
1544880	1545880	That's pretty cool.
1545880	1546880	That is very cool.
1546880	1549060	I hope, though, she has a no nudity clause in her contract.
1549060	1550060	She's a pretty girl.
1550060	1551060	They'll try to take advantage of that.
1551060	1553020	So Jessica, no nudity clause.
1553020	1554800	You better write that in your contract.
1554800	1561600	But anyway, if you want to vote for Jessica, we encourage you to Massify.com slash auditions
1561600	1563480	slash 739.
1563480	1565900	And I think you can only vote till Monday.
1565900	1568020	Her name is Chanteuse on the site.
1568020	1569020	So that's how you'll know.
1569020	1570320	And I'll post that there in chat.
1570320	1572240	So you all can go vote.
1572240	1575240	You do have to register for the site.
1575240	1577060	And they send verification emails.
1577060	1579780	But come on, in this day and age, who doesn't have a spam email account?
1579780	1580780	That all goes to us.
1580780	1582540	So I just registered my spam email account.
1582540	1589800	So Katamari's Forever in Chat says, the ferret will be in it as the slasher also.
1589800	1592300	Now that's an idea for a horror movie.
1592300	1595800	Maybe that could go in the everything is a trap game.
1595800	1598060	Maybe the ferret is the mastermind behind all the traps.
1598060	1599740	I didn't know the ferret liked slash.
1599740	1600740	It'd be wonderful.
1600740	1601740	All right.
1601740	1602740	Anyhow.
1602740	1603820	So go vote for Jessica.
1603820	1604820	Make her happy.
1604820	1610240	And well, we also want to say we know somebody in a horror movie, but all right, again, I
1610240	1613300	just I just hope they wrote the nudity out because that would be awkward.
1613300	1616880	Like you know, like, oh, hi, Jessica, I think I saw you naked in a movie.
1616880	1617880	That's kind of awkward.
1617880	1618880	All right.
1618880	1619880	Moving on.
1619880	1624220	Because chicks get naked in horror movies all the time.
1624220	1628780	So I'm just hoping she pulled the Jamie Lee Curtis, you know, and said, not not going
1628780	1629780	to happen.
1629780	1630780	All right.
1630780	1634580	Anyhow, let's get to our is very amused by the nudity talk.
1634580	1639580	Look, if you were cast for a horror movie, Tara, wouldn't you make them write a no booby
1639580	1641900	claws in the in the country?
1641900	1643780	You would want to see me naked anyway.
1643780	1644780	I know.
1644780	1646900	I'm sure there's plenty of boys who would like to see the Tatas.
1646900	1647900	But, you know.
1647900	1648900	Yes.
1648900	1650900	I mean, you guys are really selective on that.
1650900	1651900	All right.
1651900	1657260	It's like, oh, man, I got to look at moving on gaming news.
1657260	1659500	We do do gaming on this show once in a while.
1659500	1660500	Yes.
1660500	1661500	I know nothing.
1661500	1662500	We got a week to catch up on.
1662500	1663500	Loki, catch us up.
1663500	1667620	What did we miss from the week of the 11th through the 18th when we were gone?
1667620	1668620	Absolutely nothing.
1668620	1674780	Except for the news for last week, including there was a bunch of gaming events that went
1674780	1678780	on, lots of stuff that we weren't invited to, of course.
1678780	1686100	And so we have a few different gamers days, of course, one we like to talk about Konami.
1686100	1693180	They had their gamer day recently and they announced a few things, including Rock Revolution,
1693180	1700660	their journey back into, I guess, the guitar drum music game because they've never been
1700660	1701660	there before.
1701660	1706980	It's like, you know, oh, my God, they finally arrived.
1706980	1708980	It's about time.
1708980	1715220	But, yes, not to be outdone by, you know, some other companies who had put out certain
1715220	1717500	games with drums.
1717500	1721900	They decided, hey, our drum thing is not going to look like a drum at all and it's going
1721900	1727060	to have like six buttons and we're going to be awesome because we're going to one-up everybody.
1727060	1734300	So, yeah, six drum pads, one kick drum and it looks like 40 songs with download content
1734300	1739900	planned, as well as the ability to record your own songs in a jam session with eight
1739900	1749500	separate tracks, online co-op versus Battle of the Bands mode and a weird drum pad.
1749500	1755340	We actually have the first confirmed song for the new Konami drum guitar.
1755340	1756340	What's it called again?
1756340	1757340	Rock Revolution?
1757340	1758340	Yeah.
1758340	1767900	It's called the confirmed song.
1767900	1774900	No, I missed the bus.
1774900	1776500	You missed the bus, Konami.
1776500	1777500	You stole my joke.
1777500	1778500	You missed the bus.
1778500	1782100	Konami, you know what this is?
1782100	1784620	It's the sound of the boat you missed five years ago.
1784620	1791740	I just can't help but look at this and go, wow, that's, I guess, yay, yay, about time
1791740	1792740	they figured out.
1792740	1793740	Oh my God.
1793740	1794740	Rock and roll.
1794740	1795740	You can sell that.
1795740	1796860	I feel horrible saying this about Konami.
1796860	1802140	I feel really horrible saying this about Konami because, you know, they did kind of start
1802140	1803140	the whole guitar.
1803140	1808100	I mean, when they did it, they're like, but if only we could develop a guitar and drum
1808100	1809100	game.
1809100	1810100	Can we do that?
1810100	1813780	And then like two years later, oh my God, we had one all along.
1813780	1815860	Why didn't you tell me?
1815860	1819980	Years ago on this program, and I think we've all said this, we've all said years ago on
1819980	1824340	this program, we said, Konami is going to miss the bus by not putting this game out
1824340	1825340	here.
1825340	1826340	Somebody's going to beat them to it.
1826340	1829520	And I'll be damned if we weren't right.
1829520	1830820	And that's how they innovate on it.
1830820	1836180	They make this really weird looking drum pad that looks like some cheesy toy.
1836180	1839980	And then they like, um, I don't know.
1839980	1844860	I can't imagine how this is going to be the U S R and D people at Konami are pissing themselves
1844860	1846420	and shooting themselves in the foot.
1846420	1851220	Well, you know, they got to diversify themselves somehow because now the market's really getting
1851220	1852220	crowded.
1852220	1853220	I got an idea.
1853220	1854220	Fix beat mania.
1854220	1855220	Yeah.
1855220	1856220	Here's the mania is a great idea.
1856220	1860300	Dude, there are people that are going to miss the bus on that again too, because there's
1860300	1862980	that whole DJ hero that they're talking about putting out.
1862980	1867580	So once again, they're going to get beat by these other people that have the U S license
1867580	1868900	for cracking DJ.
1868900	1869900	I'm not sure.
1869900	1874260	I totally see this song in beat mania, dude, I'm stuck in the crib and I don't know what
1874260	1875260	to do.
1875260	1876260	Loki.
1876260	1880780	Didn't you know that guitar hero totally ripped off the mania definitely ripped off the guitar
1880780	1881780	hero.
1881780	1882780	Yeah, totally.
1882780	1883780	I mean, g four said it.
1883780	1884780	It must be true.
1884780	1885780	Everything anyways.
1885780	1889820	So yeah, they announced that game as well as some other games, which I'm sure no one
1889820	1890820	has ever heard of.
1890820	1891820	Uh, hold on, hold on.
1891820	1893700	AJ makes acts a really good question in chat.
1893700	1896340	Does anyone really want rock revolution?
1896340	1897340	What do you think?
1897340	1898340	I mean, is this something?
1898340	1900900	I guess the answer is if it's a good game, sure.
1900900	1901900	Yeah.
1901900	1905500	But that's just like saying, I don't really want guitar hero for either or guitar hero
1905500	1906500	world tour.
1906500	1907580	Did you cover guitar hero yet?
1907580	1908580	No.
1908580	1909580	Okay.
1909580	1910580	Talk guitar hero.
1910580	1912300	Cause I got something I want to add to this guitar hero world tour, which I don't even
1912300	1915780	know why they're calling guitar hero anymore because now they've added drums.
1915780	1920780	They're supposed to be more realistic because now they have two symbols that are up top
1920780	1922820	and then they have three drum pads as well.
1922820	1923820	So you have five.
1923820	1928500	So you're immediately better than, you know, guitars or not guitar hero, rock band, because
1928500	1933020	now you have one additional drum pad and they also have a kick drum as well.
1933020	1936660	And apparently they're going to be, um, pressure sensitive.
1936660	1940620	So if you hit them harder, the sounds heart, you know, louder, yippy.
1940620	1946080	Um, and then the guitars changed again, but it's, you know, basically just another redesign.
1946080	1949780	It's still five buttons, um, all that fun stuff.
1949780	1955260	And uh, then they also have a sound creation or a song creation mode as well.
1955260	1960060	And they're promising, you know, all the same stuff that rock bands prompt, actually all
1960060	1962900	the same stuff that rock band is delivering with.
1962900	1965980	And then some, you know, I got to say a song creation mode could be interesting.
1965980	1968860	I'll tell you one game I checked out a demo for this week was jam sessions.
1968860	1972460	I did the little, uh, Nintendo channel download service and I play jam sessions.
1972460	1973460	That's actually kind of fun.
1973460	1974460	You know what?
1974460	1976500	No, it's really original about that song creation mode.
1976500	1980460	It's that guitar freaks did it like years ago.
1980460	1985940	God damn, but Konami missed the bus years ago.
1985940	1987460	Oh, but it's completely original.
1987460	1990220	You watch G4 and go, Oh, it's a completely original idea.
1990220	1991220	So cool.
1991220	1994700	Tiger claw sent a list of what songs are supposed to be in rock revolution.
1994700	1995700	And some of it sounds interesting.
1995700	1997020	I mean, it has come on field.
1997020	1998020	The noise by quiet.
1998020	1999020	Right?
1999020	2000020	That's kind of the thing about this.
2000020	2001020	Am I evil?
2001020	2002020	Metallica?
2002020	2003020	They're focusing on drums.
2003020	2004580	That's basically their focus is on the drum.
2004580	2005580	Okay, wait.
2005580	2007580	Dance dance revolution does get some major points right here.
2007580	2009740	We're not going to take it by twisted sister.
2009740	2012420	That is pretty awesome, but they're all covers.
2012420	2014300	That's less awesome anyways.
2014300	2019700	So songs are games that we have never heard of, uh, dance dance revolution X, of course,
2019700	2021860	they're celebrating their 10th anniversary.
2021860	2027640	It's going to be all, you know, reskinned it kind of, they've got some interesting songs
2027640	2029100	for it so far.
2029100	2032580	Um, but it's going to be, uh, 70 different tracks.
2032580	2035780	They're going to have a brand new LAN battle mode that's going to allow you to play up
2035780	2039900	against, uh, eight players over, uh, LAN.
2039900	2043860	So, you know, making it competitive, although I don't know why you would have eight people
2043860	2045660	having a LAN party for DDR.
2045660	2049980	Uh, you can create your own workout and fitness program through the workout mode.
2049980	2054220	Uh, they're going to have new characters and enhanced graphics and still going to use the
2054220	2055700	damn itoy.
2055700	2061020	Um, then they're also going to have DDR universe three, which is only on the three 60 right
2061020	2068340	now, also 70 songs with music from the seventies to today, uh, DJ mode and all this new surprises.
2068340	2069340	No one.
2069340	2073500	Uh, it's more DDR quest, low key, more DDR.
2073500	2074500	Yeah.
2074500	2075980	It, they really haven't innovated there.
2075980	2081020	And then, um, hottest party too, which, you know, yeah, yeah.
2081020	2084780	So we're DDR on the week, but you can have your me's now dancing in hottest part too.
2084780	2091100	So yeah, but they showed off silent Hill silent Hills.
2091100	2092100	Pretty cool.
2092100	2093660	Happy about that.
2093660	2097020	Uh, but that's basically it from, okay.
2097020	2100180	So music games, I want to say, wait real quick on music games.
2100180	2101540	Okay.
2101540	2104060	I don't have room in my house for all that shit.
2104060	2106540	Even if I could afford it, here's the deal.
2106540	2111460	If you, if one, if these companies want to win this little war on music games, seriously,
2111460	2113940	make a peripheral that works with all the games.
2113940	2119140	Xbox 360 will not have that problem because they, well, I'm not sure about the drums,
2119140	2123380	but with the guitars, they're made like one of the things Microsoft makes all the companies
2123380	2124940	play nice with each other.
2124940	2127500	So if it's got five buttons, it will work the same way.
2127500	2129100	I didn't buy rock band for a reason.
2129100	2130100	Well, I did buy rock band.
2130100	2132180	I bought rock band as a standalone game with the guitar.
2132180	2135620	I did not buy the whole big box for a reason.
2135620	2139020	This is the reason this was coming.
2139020	2143340	We all knew it, but I don't really, here's the thing though.
2143340	2144340	I don't really care.
2144340	2149020	It's like even, I think rock bands kind of hurt themselves a little bit because now that
2149020	2152500	there's all this download content, and I don't know about a lot of people, but I've downloaded
2152500	2154300	a lot of it.
2154300	2157100	I don't really need another game with 40 songs in there.
2157100	2158900	Why do I need to buy another game?
2158900	2161420	Because they're really not going to innovate too much on it.
2161420	2163220	It's just going to have song updates.
2163220	2167060	But when you're getting, you know, three new tracks each week that you can download, by
2167060	2170380	the time you get to where another game would be released, you already have another game
2170380	2171980	built in.
2171980	2179780	And the other thing too, which I'm not sure about, you know, Guitar Hero 4 on tour world
2179780	2183260	or whatever the fuck they're calling it, World Tour.
2183260	2185460	What about all that download content that you had from 3?
2185460	2188140	I know Rock Band 2, one of the things that they were talking about is that you're going
2188140	2192720	to be able to use your old download content from Rock Band 1 with the new game.
2192720	2196540	Kind of like how, you know, DDR Ultra Mix used to do it.
2196540	2198260	Comments from chat, chat.orangelandradio.com.
2198260	2203540	Gerardimo says, wait, Miis and DDR, if you made Loki, me, in a green suit, would it be
2203540	2205300	like Loki dancing in a tingle suit?
2205300	2206300	No.
2206300	2208100	Probably the closest thing you're going to get to it.
2208100	2210460	Black Wolf is hugging his steel battalion controller.
2210460	2214980	I think making a reference to expensive peripherals.
2214980	2219300	But seriously, you're crazy if you own steel battalion.
2219300	2222460	You have to be a certain kind of crazy to own steel battalion.
2222460	2225580	Right Dark Sakura?
2225580	2228300	I have no room to talk.
2228300	2235060	But yeah, it's going to be really hard for these guys to sell, you know, because also
2235060	2239560	there's rumors going around now with what GameStop has listed on their website for Guitar
2239560	2243700	Hero World Tour, where it's going to cost like $179.
2243700	2247220	So essentially, you know, like 10 bucks more than Rock Band.
2247220	2252500	I mean, really, are you guys going to spend close to another $200 to buy, you know, I'm
2252500	2256460	assuming a lot of people out there bought Rock Band and probably bought all the peripherals
2256460	2257460	for it.
2257460	2260820	But you know, you did that because now you can use your guitar with Guitar Hero and stuff
2260820	2261820	like that.
2261820	2266280	But are you really going to buy more stuff to do Guitar Hero World Tour?
2266280	2270340	Don't get me wrong, Steel Battalion is a piece of gaming history.
2270340	2273860	I mean, it's the only controller ever that has an eject button and that makes it all
2273860	2274860	kinds of awesome.
2274860	2276700	But you seriously have to be all kinds of crazy.
2276700	2279420	It's just, I don't know, it's going to be really hard with all these games coming out
2279420	2280420	in the holiday.
2280420	2281900	I don't think some of them are going to do well.
2281900	2284300	I'm sure Guitar Hero will do well by itself.
2284300	2288340	Maybe people will just pick up World Tour and maybe do the drums later or something
2288340	2290220	because you can do that or you can buy.
2290220	2291220	I will buy the game.
2291220	2292220	I will not buy the guitar.
2292220	2295460	I will not buy the game if it's not compatible with the guitar I already have.
2295460	2299540	I am not buying a new guitar until that one is run, the one I have is run into the ground.
2299540	2300540	The end.
2300540	2303340	I don't understand why they, you know, redesign the guitar anyways each time.
2303340	2305860	It's just, all that does is delay the game.
2305860	2309940	So anyway, so enough of Konami's gamer days.
2309940	2310940	Alright, sorry.
2310940	2311940	That's the last week's news.
2311940	2314780	Anyways, so other stuff.
2314780	2318700	We've got Sony had their sort of gamer day.
2318700	2319940	So there's some stuff coming out of that.
2319940	2327260	I remember they've got, they were showing off some of their new games like, you know,
2327260	2331460	Killzone 2 and Resistance Fall Man 2 and that kind of stuff.
2331460	2333740	Resistance is supposed to be coming out this fall.
2333740	2337460	Killzone 2 has been delayed to February because they don't want to compete with themselves,
2337460	2339180	which, you know, makes sense.
2339180	2345060	And then Motor Storm is going to be coming out, of course, also in the fall as well.
2345060	2352740	Little Big Planet, October, and there is a new SOCOM game, Confrontation, I believe,
2352740	2356340	that's coming out to their PlayStation Network in September.
2356340	2360540	Also, Sega was showing off their stuff as well.
2360540	2364380	They announced a partnership with Platinum Games and they're going to be putting out
2364380	2368340	three games in the beginning of this.
2368340	2370940	One of the games, pretty awesome.
2370940	2373180	Did they announce plastic maracas for Samba?
2373180	2374180	No.
2374180	2375180	Don't care.
2375180	2377260	Well, that's not Platinum Games, okay.
2377260	2378260	But they're working on it.
2378260	2382060	They want to make those, okay.
2382060	2388380	So right now, the one game, Mad World, which is going to be an ultra-violent game for the
2388380	2389380	Wii.
2389380	2390380	It's all black and white except for the blood.
2390380	2392900	All right, I'm interested.
2392900	2393900	Extremely awesome.
2393900	2399020	There were, you know, they're killing people in all sorts of fun ways.
2399020	2404420	There's another game that's going to be coming out as well.
2404420	2406780	That is on the DS.
2406780	2410380	I'm trying to remember who was making that one.
2410380	2411380	Some other developer.
2411380	2414820	But it's a pretty cool like, I want to say like a shooter game.
2414820	2417160	What was it?
2417160	2420740	It was Infinite Line.
2420740	2423420	And I love the company's name for this, Nude Maker.
2423420	2424420	Nice.
2424420	2429860	But they, and to kind of tie back here, they are the creator of Steel Battalion and before
2429860	2433780	that, the Clock Tower series, and that's coming to the DS.
2433780	2439300	And then on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, they're getting a game called Bayonetta,
2439300	2446340	which is an action game starring this chick that has guns on her feet, like pistols.
2446340	2450380	Wasn't that the movie that Quentin Tarantino did recently?
2450380	2455660	It's not, she doesn't, she has legs, but there's like strapped to her boots are like pistols.
2455660	2456660	Okay.
2456660	2457660	Type thing.
2457660	2458660	All right.
2458660	2459660	It's cool looking.
2459660	2460660	Okay.
2460660	2461660	And so that's going to be coming as well.
2461660	2466420	And I think not the, I think she's supposed to be like a witch or something, not to compare
2466420	2469140	it to bullet with sharing a thing, but.
2469140	2470620	So she's a witch with guns.
2470620	2471620	Witch with guns.
2471620	2472620	Amazing.
2472620	2473620	And.
2473620	2474620	Why didn't I think of that?
2474620	2476020	I don't know.
2476020	2478940	You're just not on the cutting edge of game development there.
2478940	2483180	This is why we have a podcast on the internet and I'm trying to think if there's anything
2483180	2484180	else.
2484180	2485180	Reading comments from chat real quick.
2485180	2488740	DJ Morpheus says, then I'll get the rock band rehab expansion that comes when you create
2488740	2490380	your own eat true Hollywood story.
2490380	2491380	That would be fun.
2491380	2493700	Like a tar hero mixed with heroin hero.
2493700	2495820	Good times.
2495820	2496820	Let's see.
2496820	2500060	Gerardo says that there might be Morocco sleeves for somebody because that's one thing they're
2500060	2501060	talking about.
2501060	2502900	If not, there's always third party companies.
2502900	2503900	Someone will make it.
2503900	2507540	If you, the demands there.
2507540	2511900	One thing, they had, Microsoft did their little gamer day thing as well.
2511900	2515380	They showed off the new Banjo Kazooie game.
2515380	2518220	No motion controllers, unfortunately.
2518220	2521460	No word on what that lips peripheral was or anything like that.
2521460	2523700	I guess we're just going to have to wait.
2523700	2527900	And they showed off Gears of War 2, of course, a little bit more of that.
2527900	2530420	Looks pretty awesome.
2530420	2532540	And that of course will be coming out this fall.
2532540	2534580	Trying to think if there's anything else.
2534580	2535580	Cool.
2535580	2540940	We'll be getting into later on about Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.
2540940	2548160	And I also know that the XNA service has been launched, but just for the developers.
2548160	2552700	So people that have a membership to XNA can play the games.
2552700	2554340	All right.
2554340	2557700	So well, it sounds like because wasn't the community supposed to vote on the games and
2557700	2558700	stuff?
2558700	2561980	They're probably getting it ready for letting it run a few cycles so that they have some
2561980	2563740	games to go live when they go live.
2563740	2564740	Yeah.
2564740	2565740	All right.
2565740	2566860	Enough of last week's news.
2566860	2568540	We're almost 45 minutes into the show.
2568540	2571060	It's time to get into this week's news.
2571060	2574780	And speaking of Guitar Hero, we're going to start off with another Guitar Hero story because
2574780	2577260	I swear these music games have been all over the news lately.
2577260	2578900	It's crazy.
2578900	2583300	On the PlayStation 3 only, Guitar Hero is going to be getting a free song.
2583300	2587140	It makes sense because the Xbox 360 got a free Halo song.
2587140	2590940	So why not a free God of War song for PlayStation 3 owners?
2590940	2594020	And that's exactly what they're going to be getting on June 5th.
2594020	2596620	Except we don't know which song it is.
2596620	2601980	Just knows that it's a God of War song and it probably has a lot of heavy guitars seeing
2601980	2603660	as it's going to be in Guitar Hero.
2603660	2604660	So it'd be free.
2604660	2607700	So it's kind of like Sony's answer to, or I guess you could say, you know, the equivalent
2607700	2613300	of the Halo theme on the Xbox 360 Guitar Hero.
2613300	2614300	So check it out.
2614300	2615300	Do we have to?
2615300	2616300	No, you don't have to.
2616300	2618300	I mean, if you don't own a PS3, you kind of can't.
2618300	2619300	I'll check it out.
2619300	2620300	Then I won't.
2620300	2623700	I like free, but then again, Yaris was also free.
2623700	2624700	That's true.
2624700	2626540	But I don't, I don't see how you can go wrong with a free song.
2626540	2630260	Free songs are only going to, if a free song sucks, it's only going to terrorize you for
2630260	2631460	three minutes and then it's over.
2631460	2634820	Unless it's yodeling with, you know, Zither as the company.
2634820	2635820	Yodel Hero.
2635820	2636820	Where's that?
2636820	2637820	That's, that's what I want.
2637820	2643060	How about something that has absolutely nothing to do with music games?
2643060	2644060	Wind it up.
2644060	2645060	Nothing to do with music games.
2645060	2646060	All right.
2646060	2647060	Nothing to do with music games.
2647060	2649980	Except for one of these theme songs was used in Pop Up Music.
2649980	2650980	Okay.
2650980	2656420	One, actually two of my favorite companies ever are getting together to make a fighting
2656420	2657420	game.
2657420	2662540	I am very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very tense, infinity happy about
2662540	2664340	this.
2664340	2666580	We are getting Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
2666580	2667580	Yay.
2667580	2668580	So happy.
2668580	2671980	And for those that have no effing idea what Tatsunoko is.
2671980	2678460	Is this the animation studio that gave us such a wonderful series as of course my favorite
2678460	2686220	of all time, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman gave us Kashan, which are actually Ken and
2686220	2690220	Tetsuya are both confirmed characters for that.
2690220	2694700	They're on the test versions now along with Ryu and Chun-Li.
2694700	2698860	But they're also for, you know, other things that they gave us was Hurricane Polymer did
2698860	2702940	a lot of the animation for Evangelion.
2702940	2707940	It gave us, I don't know if anyone watched a lot of Nickelodeon in the, the mid to late
2707940	2715060	80s, but they gave us the little bits and quite a few other crazy, well, they actually
2715060	2732500	have the Gatchaman music in it, but also, and I apologize, I had to use a different
2732500	2736420	source in what you gave me, Rob, because I, that's all right.
2736420	2743980	What was also sort of hinted at as far as being included in the game is characters from
2743980	2751820	Timeboukan, Hurricane Polymer, Tekkaman, Hakusho and Daimo, the Genie family.
2751820	2758060	So and anyone else who doesn't know, MotGogoGo was Tatsunoko as well, which was Speed Racer
2758060	2759060	for us.
2759060	2760060	Was it Macross also?
2760060	2761060	Macross was as well.
2761060	2762060	Yes.
2762060	2767140	It's an honest question though, is this game really going to come out in America?
2767140	2768140	Like ever?
2768140	2772780	God, I hope so, and if not, I'll drive my ass down to Arcade Infinity and play the hell
2772780	2773780	out of it.
2773780	2774780	Oh, it's an arcade.
2774780	2775780	Yeah.
2775780	2776780	Hmm.
2776780	2780260	Oh, they're not, are they putting it out on home platforms at all, they said?
2780260	2781260	I haven't seen any mention on it.
2781260	2784500	Hopefully PlayStation 3, because then you can import that bitch.
2784500	2785500	That's a good point.
2785500	2790380	However, if anyone wants to see, there are some, okay, don't look for the Famitsu scans,
2790380	2791380	they're crap.
2791380	2795980	Um, go actually onto Famitsu's website and look up the images.
2795980	2802020	I mean, if you, if you do a search for Tatsunoko versus Capcom, you'll find a link to Famitsu's
2802020	2804500	page that's got all the stuff on it.
2804500	2806900	Just tons of pretty pictures.
2806900	2813060	And one of the levels that they're fighting on looks like it's a Mega Man Legends level.
2813060	2814060	Wait, what?
2814060	2816220	Thank God the Servbots are back.
2816220	2819820	Yeah, it has a giant Servbot in the background.
2819820	2820820	Hot.
2820820	2824260	So, um, maybe we'll be seeing, uh, Rockman.
2824260	2826700	Maybe we'll be seeing Tron Bon.
2826700	2828380	That would be cool.
2828380	2830540	Rama is pretty convinced it's not coming out here.
2830540	2834300	He says in chat, uh, Tatsunoko versus Capcom will not happen in the U S due to massive
2834300	2835300	licensing issues.
2835300	2837420	It doesn't mean they won't import it over here.
2837420	2841140	So never say never, but it'll be, you know, import heaven.
2841140	2843980	Why do you think I said arcade infinity?
2843980	2845620	Cause they, they, are they still around?
2845620	2846620	Are they still?
2846620	2847620	I'm sure they are.
2847620	2848620	I'm sure they are too.
2848620	2853340	I mean, what are, what arcades have been getting like the, the big imports for ages?
2853340	2854340	True is arcade.
2854340	2856300	They even had that weirdo Gundam game.
2856300	2857300	I mean, hello.
2857300	2858300	They had um, Jammer Lammy.
2858300	2863460	I remember playing the game and I had to now don't get the dirty thoughts out of your mind.
2863460	2866580	I had to play the game on my knees because it's made for little kids.
2866580	2869580	So I had to like get on my knees to play the arcade game.
2869580	2872660	Best game that was there was the pancake flipping game.
2872660	2876700	No, no, no punch mania.
2876700	2879900	The tambourine game was my favorite thing ever.
2879900	2882900	That that was the gayest game I've ever played in my life.
2882900	2883900	Yes.
2883900	2886540	It was samba de amigo with tambourines and you actually had to shake the tambourine and
2886540	2887780	make these little motions.
2887780	2892740	It was the gayest thing I've ever done in my life.
2892740	2893740	Are you sure?
2893740	2894740	You gay?
2894740	2895740	Yes.
2895740	2900980	If you play a tambourine game, you gay.
2900980	2906660	For real like I've marched in the San Francisco pride parade and the tambourine game was gayer.
2906660	2907660	Alright.
2907660	2910660	I marched behind like assless chaps across America.
2910660	2912140	Better than wearing the orange hat.
2912140	2914100	And the tambourine was gayer.
2914100	2917540	Alright, moving on.
2917540	2919140	Tambourine was gayer.
2919140	2925460	Anyways, so Microsoft made an announcement and this kind of ruins all those rumors that
2925460	2932660	we had earlier about motion sensing calibration coming to a spring update.
2932660	2935820	Well there is no spring dashboard update this year.
2935820	2941820	So so sad, no update, but you know there may be some other stuff coming later on that's
2941820	2944500	not involved with a dashboard update.
2944500	2945500	So.
2945500	2946500	Oh well.
2946500	2950140	If it ain't broke, don't fix it I guess.
2950140	2952180	If it ain't broke, break it more.
2952180	2953180	I don't know.
2953180	2954620	It's a little sad though that they're not doing an update.
2954620	2957740	I kind of looked forward to those things and especially like we knew.
2957740	2962100	I think some list leaked that week we were out of the supposed things that were going
2962100	2963100	to be in it.
2963100	2966100	They were supposed to have podcasts on the 360 now and all this stuff and I was thinking
2966100	2970620	like this all sounds really cool even though I you know we all knew the list was bullshit.
2970620	2974660	I mean it was still kind of sad when Microsoft says no none of it.
2974660	2976660	None of it for you.
2976660	2980740	Yeah it just better make the fall update that much cooler.
2980740	2981740	Before I forget.
2981740	2982740	Sorry to interrupt.
2982740	2990200	I'm linking the Tatsunoko versus Capcom Famitsu page in the chat room.
2990200	2992860	I was so three minutes ago.
2992860	2993860	Sorry.
2993860	2994860	I had to find it.
2994860	2995860	I do that all the time.
2995860	2996860	Timmy missed the bus.
2996860	2998860	I wouldn't shut up about the missed the bus the whole time.
2998860	2999860	I didn't miss the bus.
2999860	3000860	I drive a fucking tank.
3000860	3001860	Alright.
3001860	3007500	I blew up the bus.
3007500	3009700	Speaking of bus.
3009700	3013540	I made a new friend last night is actually somebody who's listened to our show before.
3013540	3017980	He's a friend of a mutual friend and we were talking about games we'd like to see on the
3017980	3018980	Wii.
3018980	3022780	We were talking about the Wii Wheel and he said I know what the Wii Wheel would be useful
3022780	3023780	for.
3023780	3026380	Desert bus on virtual console.
3026380	3028000	You go to hell.
3028000	3029860	You go to hell.
3029860	3033580	And I was like that would make that Wii Wheel kind of useful.
3033580	3038220	Yeah for you know an 18 hour drive in real time.
3038220	3041640	It was a four hour drive in real time isn't it?
3041640	3044540	It's Vegas L.A. isn't it?
3044540	3046820	Alright it's.
3046820	3047820	That is hotness.
3047820	3048820	Jamie's making me look at screen time.
3048820	3050820	Yes it's very sexy.
3050820	3061340	Alright let's move on to some more gaming news and something
3061340	3064500	you might be able to play on the Xbox 360.
3064500	3067220	RBI baseball.
3067220	3068520	Remember RBI baseball?
3068520	3073620	This game is old school like I think it was yeah it was put out by Tengen.
3073620	3077620	They were like the rebel company you know they put out that original Tetris.
3077620	3080820	So basically it was, wasn't it a spin off of Atari like an Atari.
3080820	3081820	Yes it was.
3081820	3082820	Yeah.
3082820	3083820	So here's the thing.
3083820	3084820	Poor Atari.
3084820	3091200	Apparently the ESRB is listed RBI baseball but the developers is six degree games.
3091200	3095020	So I don't know if it's going to be the same RBI baseball.
3095020	3096020	Probably not.
3096020	3097020	It better be.
3097020	3099720	That would be kind of rad if it was because that's that I don't play a lot of sports games
3099720	3102240	but I remember RBI baseball.
3102240	3109140	They really should like change their name to the six degrees of Kevin Bacon.
3109140	3113740	So regardless the ESRB listed it so you know it's coming soon RBI baseball to Xbox Live
3113740	3115860	Arcade.
3115860	3119060	Well we have some other news regarding Xbox Live Arcade.
3119060	3121820	Anything that's crap goes.
3121820	3130340	Microsoft is going to be delisting older Xbox Live Arcade titles that sold small numbers
3130340	3133060	and have a low Metacritic average.
3133060	3134060	Yaris?
3134060	3135060	Please be Yaris.
3135060	3138460	It was free so a ton of people downloaded it.
3138460	3139460	It's attached rates.
3139460	3140540	Yaris will be immune.
3140540	3144300	People that bought the full version and unfortunately since it was a free download that counts as
3144300	3145300	the full version.
3145300	3146300	Fuck.
3146300	3151100	There's a quote by Mark Whitten who's Xbox Live's general manager saying we will be delisting
3151100	3156540	older underperforming titles in order to keep the service focused on a section of high quality
3156540	3157540	games.
3157540	3161060	To translate that means they're shit get them off the server.
3161060	3166420	No to translate that means our marketplace is insufficient to handle this many games
3166420	3171780	so we have to find a way to reduce it because I think that's seriously what it is is that
3171780	3177500	there's too many games in the marketplace because Xbox doesn't present it in a very
3177500	3179780	user friendly way.
3179780	3185380	Well the rest of the quote goes on to say the way this will work is that the title will
3185380	3189980	need to be at least six months old and have a Metacritic score below 65 and a conversion
3189980	3193620	rate below 6% on the service.
3193620	3197980	Which means fewer than 6% of the people will have downloaded the demo and actually pay
3197980	3198980	for it.
3198980	3203860	They say they're also giving a three month notice before delisting anything.
3203860	3207460	That's kind of interesting though that the critics will have kind of a say.
3207460	3209020	That's kind of scary in a way.
3209020	3213060	I mean I realize it's got to be both criteria but that's still kind of strange to me.
3213060	3214060	Yeah.
3214060	3215060	I don't know.
3215060	3216060	Let's see.
3216060	3219500	Here's some games that per Metacritic would be eligible for delisting.
3219500	3222380	Now granted we don't know how well it sold through.
3222380	3224300	Discs of Tron has a 44.
3224300	3227140	I have to go download that now.
3227140	3230500	I got to tell you what though it really isn't.
3230500	3232020	It was better in your childhood Jamie.
3232020	3233020	It really was.
3233020	3234460	Is it at least six months old?
3234460	3235740	It's getting there.
3235740	3238380	So it's not eligible yet.
3238380	3242340	Let's see what else is under 65 here Metacritic.
3242340	3245100	Mr. Driller online is a 48 right now.
3245100	3248860	So Mr. Driller online would be eligible for the plug pull in.
3248860	3249860	Let's see.
3249860	3254940	Rocky and Bullinkle 37 on Metacritic but that game, that game was shit.
3254940	3256860	That game was pretty shit.
3256860	3257860	Tikal.
3257860	3258860	Tikal.
3258860	3259860	Tikal.
3259860	3260860	58.
3260860	3261860	Quick.
3261860	3264460	Can you name what Tikal, can you name what that game is?
3264460	3266020	It's a puzzle game.
3266020	3267020	Okay.
3267020	3268020	Good.
3268020	3269020	You're right.
3269020	3270020	It's a puzzle game.
3270020	3271020	So that's what we got.
3271020	3272020	Let's see.
3272020	3274340	That gives you an idea of the type of games that could be there.
3274340	3279460	Yaris I believe was 17, had a score of 17 on Metacritic last time I looked.
3279460	3280460	Bye bye Yaris.
3280460	3281460	It was pretty terrible.
3281460	3282460	Euthanizing.
3282460	3283460	But it's got the sell through.
3283460	3284460	I don't know.
3284460	3285460	Now here's the thing.
3285460	3290020	Tiger call also said the other exact thing I was thinking before is that this, Sky this
3290020	3295180	is also bad because people that bought those games won't be able to redownload them if
3295180	3296980	they ever delete them from the hard drive.
3296980	3300820	But Black Wolf says that question was asked directly and they said yes, you can still
3300820	3304460	redownload them using the account management interface.
3304460	3308820	And Black Wolf says they just won't have shelf space anymore, which is kind of a good comparison
3308820	3312380	to make is that it's like pulling these games off of shelves and putting them in the bargain
3312380	3313380	bin.
3313380	3314380	They're not selling.
3314380	3316180	I think these games should go in the bargain bin, honestly.
3316180	3318220	But Yaris was already free.
3318220	3320460	So they have to pay people to download Yaris.
3320460	3322660	Which they should be.
3322660	3325820	There's no amount of money worth downloading Yaris.
3325820	3327420	So it's going to be interesting.
3327420	3328900	I'm kind of curious to see the effect.
3328900	3333020	I mean, I agree to some extent they need to clean up Xbox Live.
3333020	3336180	But I don't know if I agree with getting rid of games completely.
3336180	3339820	Sweeping them under the rug and making them harder to find.
3339820	3340820	Sure.
3340820	3344900	Spotlighting the games that need to be have the spotlight on them because these other
3344900	3347580	you know crappy retro ports are out doing them.
3347580	3351540	You know, Rob, if they're going to clean up Xbox Live, they should probably start with
3351540	3353420	the users.
3353420	3357100	Well, they have been doing that to some extent recently.
3357100	3360500	We'll get to more on that a little later.
3360500	3363500	But for now, let's get back to some more gaming news.
3363500	3367540	So Xbox, one of the things, and this kind of goes back to people having to redownload
3367540	3369340	games and stuff.
3369340	3375940	If you've ever had your Xbox 360 crap out on you and, you know, got a replacement, you
3375940	3380160	may find that some of your games don't work anymore unless you're logged in online.
3380160	3384900	Well now, Microsoft is going to release a tool tied in with Xbox.com that will allow
3384900	3391500	you to fix the digital rights management so that your games are locked to your new console
3391500	3396780	so there will be no more problems with your games not working offline.
3396780	3398900	About fucking time.
3398900	3400900	About damn time.
3400900	3405360	That also applies to if you bought an elite system and transferred your stuff using that
3405360	3407780	hard drive transfer cable.
3407780	3408980	That will also screw it up.
3408980	3412460	So that's nice to see that they're finally fixing it.
3412460	3416060	Yeah, seems to be a little late, but yeah, I have a couple games, because I got the Red
3416060	3417060	Ring of Death.
3417060	3421020	Now granted, I got Red Ring of Death three days after I bought my Xbox 360, so I only
3421020	3424700	have two games that do this, but Geometry Wars and Joust were like the first two games
3424700	3426620	I bought on Xbox Live Arcade.
3426620	3431060	And whenever I try to play them, if I'm not connected to Xbox Live, they won't work.
3431060	3432660	So in Geometry Wars, that's a pretty big deal.
3432660	3436740	Like, and you'll know, I even noticed like a little bit of lag when I go into the game,
3436740	3440140	like it's talking to Xbox Live and then realizes I have the retail version and then suddenly
3440140	3442420	my menu changes to the retail menu.
3442420	3443860	It all happens within seconds.
3443860	3446460	So it'll be kind of nice to take those games back.
3446460	3450420	I know other people have had way worse scenarios where it was more than two games and multiple
3450420	3451420	users in the house.
3451420	3453860	My console has way more than two games.
3453860	3454860	Yeah.
3454860	3460420	So, that'll be kind of nice to reset the digital rights management, so we'll see how that works
3460420	3462380	when that comes out.
3462380	3466140	I will definitely be running it to get those, to take back control of those two games, but
3466140	3467140	we'll see.
3467140	3472340	Well, you're talking a little bit about rediscovering things that were a little bit old and if you've
3472340	3476980	never played Gears of War, it's probably time to come out from under your rock and now's
3476980	3480240	a good time though because what's going to be happening is that Gears of War is coming
3480240	3485620	out with a brand new like re-release, a game of the year edition, if you will.
3485620	3487100	It's coming out this summer.
3487100	3492380	It's Gears of War with all the download content included that originally people had to pay
3492380	3495220	for and it's only going to be 40 bucks.
3495220	3498900	So, that's kind of cool.
3498900	3501620	I won't be impressed because I like the Windows version.
3501620	3504300	So, June 24th is apparently the day this is coming out.
3504300	3508100	Hey, just in time for my birthday and the sixth birthday of Orange Launch Radio as well
3508100	3509260	on the 23rd of June.
3509260	3510260	That's hardcore.
3510260	3511260	Yes.
3511260	3515300	So, if you haven't played Gears of War, you can check that out, but I think honestly most
3515300	3518880	people that would enjoy Gears of War have probably already played it, so this does seem
3518880	3523900	a little bit late, but there's a lot of people that are just now getting Xbox 360s too, you
3523900	3529580	know, as the price comes down and more people get HDTVs and want to spend their stimulus
3529580	3532540	checks and yada, yada, yada.
3532540	3535500	They'll be an audience for this and won't be a huge audience, but they'll be an audience
3535500	3536700	for this.
3536700	3542500	Well, one thing though that I think is going to work out better for everybody who has an
3542500	3548540	Xbox and it's about damn time and I think that we all saw it happening is that Xbox
3548540	3557340	Live Arcade is going to be changing their limit from 150MB to 350MB and it's been made
3557340	3564660	official especially since we've got Soul Calibur coming out.
3564660	3568940	They're really trying to get me to upgrade to that 100GB hard drive already because I
3568940	3572260	only have a 20GB drive still that I've just been making work.
3572260	3574980	I had to finally uninstall Final Fantasy XI to get the room.
3574980	3579740	Well, the price limit of Xbox Live Arcade games has actually also been raised to 1600
3579740	3582740	points, which is about 20 bucks.
3582740	3585700	Developers, you better make darn sure your game is worth it.
3585700	3590140	I mean, the Penny Arcade game, they'll get it for that and it's, you know, it's pretty
3590140	3591140	cool.
3591140	3593620	Again, I don't have a chance, I haven't had a chance to give it a full review yet, so
3593620	3597180	I can't say for sure if it's worth the 20 bucks, but it seems like it will be.
3597180	3600300	We shall see.
3600300	3604180	Interesting though that they're, why do they even have the limits in the first place?
3604180	3608140	I guess they don't want people to go crazy, but I think, you know, when you, oh yeah,
3608140	3611140	the original Xbox games are like one or two gigs.
3611140	3615060	Well, originally they wanted to make sure that people that did not buy hard drives were
3615060	3617780	able to put at least one game on their memory unit.
3617780	3618780	You know.
3618780	3621100	Well, now the memory units are 512, so now they can do three hits.
3621100	3622540	I don't know, it's stupid, but yeah.
3622540	3623540	Or they could just do 512.
3623540	3627740	Or, I don't know, you buy a hard drive like everybody fucking else, okay?
3627740	3628740	Seriously.
3628740	3629740	Exactly.
3629740	3635580	So, this is not a big surprise, I mean, the game that did so well, eventually of course
3635580	3642300	it would be coming to the PlayStation 3, but Bioshock is officially coming to the PS3.
3642300	3647620	It has been rumored to be coming for a while now, and it will be due out this holiday,
3647620	3654940	and apparently the port, they claim, is gonna have slightly better graphics, some additional
3654940	3657340	game content.
3657340	3662580	We'll have to see, I guess, when it comes out.
3662580	3665900	But everyone should get an opportunity to play Bioshock.
3665900	3666960	Absolutely.
3666960	3670460	One of these days we'll have to check out Bioshock.
3670460	3675300	Are they gonna do that much more special on the PlayStation 3?
3675300	3676300	Probably not.
3676300	3680400	It'd probably be all the stuff that was download content before, maybe add another difficulty
3680400	3681980	or something like that, who knows?
3681980	3682980	Alright.
3682980	3686140	Let's travel around the world and discover some release dates.
3686140	3689020	Loki, why don't you start us off with what's coming out in the U.S.?
3689020	3693500	Well, this week there's not a whole lot coming out, pretty much, you know, the big title
3693500	3700180	is gonna be Enemy Territory Quake Wars on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3700180	3704260	Also on the Wii this week we've got Death Junior.
3704260	3708260	I don't know, I don't know if I get too excited about the Death Junior game, but yes, brand
3708260	3712540	new Death Junior, well actually I wouldn't say it's brand new, it's a remake coming to
3712540	3713540	the Wii.
3713540	3720540	There's also Emergency Heroes, which is just like Emergency Mayhem, both sort of like Crazy
3720540	3726540	Taxi and, I don't know, that's gonna be coming out to the Wii.
3726540	3735380	And then this week is, I believe, Super Dodgeball Brawlers, which was a, I don't know if you
3735380	3740420	guys remember the original Dodgeball game on the NES, it's kinda like a sequel to that,
3740420	3743900	so that was kind of interesting.
3743900	3749260	Let's see, also this week, Lost Planet Extreme Condition Colonies Edition, the Game of the
3749260	3754460	Year kind of version of it for 30 bucks, with some little additional content in there, they
3754460	3759220	have like a first version shooter mode and some other crap, so that's kinda neat.
3759220	3764740	And The Monkey King, The Legend Begins, coming out on the Wii, it's another budget game,
3764740	3770940	but it's a side-scroller shooter, it's all 2D hand-drawn, so that's kinda neat.
3770940	3776100	The Metallic Rose DS Lite, coming out this week, also...
3776100	3779900	I saw a commercial on TV for the Metallic, I don't, well I think she was playing a Metallic
3779900	3784780	Rose or a pink DS, but it had Carrie Underwood playing Nintendogs on the DS.
3784780	3786780	I don't even remember what show I was watching that shot on.
3786780	3787780	Did her dogs run away from her?
3787780	3788780	Does that be funny?
3788780	3791100	No, they did, she was giving them a bath and giggling, although I bet it wasn't even her
3791100	3792100	playing the game.
3792100	3795380	They just had her posing with an empty DS.
3795380	3797940	I'm trying to remember what the hell I was watching, they actually showed that, but I
3797940	3798940	just thought that was interesting.
3798940	3802620	Because I remember there was that commercial in the UK with Nicole Kidman, but they have
3802620	3805860	one here now with Carrie Underwood, and I just thought it was interesting.
3805860	3806860	Also this week, Mass Effect...
3806860	3809460	I must have been watching some girly TV show.
3809460	3811620	Actually, I think it was during Ellen.
3811620	3815300	I think I was watching Ellen when I was home sick one day and I saw that, because Ellen's
3815300	3817380	kind of a girly show, right?
3817380	3818380	Yeah.
3818380	3824100	Also, on the PC, Mass Effect is finally coming out, so you can play that as well.
3824100	3827500	Dracula Origin on PC.
3827500	3834000	If you want to shop at GameStop, there's the USA Today Crosswords Challenge, which is a
3834000	3835340	GameStop exclusive.
3835340	3841260	Woo wee, that's one hell of an exclusive that's put out by Destineer, who makes only good
3841260	3842260	games, I'm sure.
3842260	3844660	Oh wait, no they don't.
3844660	3850620	And then... and then that's pretty much... oh, World Championship Cards.
3850620	3856940	That's right, it's card games that aren't poker or blackjack.
3856940	3857940	Like Solitaire.
3857940	3858940	Awesome.
3858940	3867460	Oh, and there's a game called Bus Driver for the PC by Gostgame Entertainment.
3867460	3871280	As long as Bus Driver has an awesome theme song, that'd be cool.
3871280	3873020	I think we all know the theme song already.
3873020	3875300	Rama's accusing me of watching Lifetime again.
3875300	3879500	No, there haven't been any Lifetime movies recently that I've been interested in watching.
3879500	3884260	Although I think there's a new one coming out that has... well, forget it.
3884260	3885260	I love Lifetime movies.
3885260	3889380	Aren't Lifetime movies the best?
3889380	3892300	I'm like, they're so horrible that they're good.
3892300	3894300	It's like a secret shame, you know?
3894300	3900900	You don't want people to know you watch that stuff, but then you're sick, or you are feeling
3900900	3905980	like in a bad mood, and then you put it on Lifetime, and you're like, my life is so much
3905980	3906980	better than this.
3906980	3910020	I think that was actually the name of a Lifetime movie.
3910020	3911020	A Secret Shame.
3911020	3913200	And it makes me so embarrassed to be a man.
3913200	3915660	The Dark Sakura Story.
3915660	3916900	Rob.
3916900	3918420	What?
3918420	3921940	I have no secret shame.
3921940	3927660	My shame is very public because I go to it once a week.
3927660	3931740	A certain little garage studio.
3931740	3933740	Very very public shame.
3933740	3934740	Rob.
3934740	3935740	What?
3935740	3942740	They totally should make a Lifetime movie of the week about Jamie's life.
3942740	3944300	Who would play Jamie?
3944300	3946740	That's the question of the day.
3946740	3948340	We need an instant poll in chat.
3948340	3951860	Who would play Jamie in her Lifetime movie of the week?
3951860	3954220	Someone who's sufficiently bitchy.
3954220	3958140	Because I'd say Ella is a douche coup because I don't want to look like myself.
3958140	3959140	Well I don't know.
3959140	3960140	Christina Ricci.
3960140	3961140	No.
3961140	3964340	She's not really a celebrity, but she's a TV celebrity I guess.
3964340	3968580	But that one chick, Mary Alice from Ace of Cakes.
3968580	3969580	That would work.
3969580	3970580	I don't watch TV.
3970580	3972580	Janine Garofalo about ten years ago.
3972580	3973580	Yes!
3973580	3974580	I like her.
3974580	3976980	I would approve of her.
3976980	3979340	She's sufficiently bitchy.
3979340	3982100	Jamie Summers as herself says act deaf.
3982100	3984100	Margaret Cho says don't tattoo ya.
3984100	3987140	Hi, I'm not Korean.
3987140	3988860	I look nothing like Margaret Cho.
3988860	3990900	Margaret Cho is gorgeous, but no.
3990900	3994740	Rama says my best friend Patty.
3994740	3996140	Tina Fey as Jamie.
3996140	3997980	Oh, that's a good one.
3997980	4000020	Tina Fey is the gal that she was in Mean Girls.
4000020	4001780	She was the teacher with the glasses and everything.
4001780	4002780	I have to look this up now.
4002780	4004140	Look her up.
4004140	4005140	That's a good one.
4005140	4006140	That's my favorite so far.
4006140	4009300	Ew, Rachael Ray.
4009300	4010300	That's wrong.
4010300	4011300	Instant ban.
4011300	4012300	No, I'm just kidding.
4012300	4013300	Alright.
4013300	4016940	I have a friend who has a picture of her with genius on it.
4016940	4017940	Tina Fey is cute.
4017940	4018940	I like her.
4018940	4019940	Alright.
4019940	4024620	Anyhow, release dates over in Japan.
4024620	4030500	Coming on the Xbox 360, Battle Fantasia comes out as well as Lost Planet Colonies and Overlord
4030500	4033660	all coming out on May the 29th in Japan.
4033660	4036380	Coming out on the Playstation 3, another port of Battle Fantasia.
4036380	4038900	I'm not exactly sure what Battle Fantasia is.
4038900	4039900	I've not heard of this.
4039900	4040900	Battle Fantasia just sounds awesome.
4040900	4043100	It's like a fighting game.
4043100	4044100	Is it really?
4044100	4045100	It's pretty cool looking.
4045100	4046100	Oh yeah.
4046100	4047100	It definitely looks like a little fighting game.
4047100	4050260	There's a character called Marco who's like a little knight and Urs.
4050260	4051260	The art style.
4051260	4056460	If you have a Japanese account, they have a Japanese demo for it which I have not played
4056460	4057460	yet.
4057460	4058460	Is this by Namco?
4058460	4060580	Because the art style reminds me of Eternal Sonata like a lot.
4060580	4062740	No, it's by Arc System Works.
4062740	4063740	Huh.
4063740	4064740	Go figure.
4064740	4065740	Be familiar with the guy.
4065740	4066740	Oh, they did Guilty Gear.
4066740	4068580	Guilty Gear and Fist of the North Star.
4068580	4069780	Alright, so there you have it.
4069780	4074340	Cygames coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
4074340	4079100	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii Biohazard 4 Wii Edition.
4079100	4080500	You might know that as Resident Evil.
4080500	4082420	They call it Biohazard Overseas.
4082420	4085220	Family Trainer Athletic World with Matt.
4085220	4088880	Please note that is not Wii Fit but a cheap knockoff.
4088880	4093660	On the Playstation 2, hey, remember Beatmania 2DX?
4093660	4094660	Remember that game?
4094660	4095660	Uh, what?
4095660	4096660	Remember that game?
4096660	4103540	14th Edition Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold finally hits the Playstation 2 on May the 29th.
4103540	4104540	As well as...
4104540	4105540	I should get that.
4105540	4106540	I kind of want it too.
4106540	4107540	Just for old times sake.
4107540	4110340	I actually want Happy Sky just because it says Happy Sky.
4110340	4111340	Burnout Revenge.
4111340	4114780	I totally think I'm just going to buy all the Beatmania games I can that I'm missing.
4114780	4116840	Because I seriously stopped at 9th style.
4116840	4117940	So I'm missing a lot.
4117940	4119820	The last I bought was 8th.
4119820	4120820	Yeah.
4120820	4121820	I loved Red though.
4121820	4122980	Anyway, forget it.
4122980	4129100	Burnout Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta, because Japan needed their Def Jam Vendetta.
4129100	4134020	Fatal Fury Battle Archives is coming out on the Playstation 2 on May 29th.
4134020	4137380	Fushugi Yugi gets some new games coming out.
4137380	4138380	That series.
4138380	4139380	Yeah.
4139380	4140380	Let it die please.
4140380	4141380	Suzaku Ibun.
4141380	4142380	No, no, no.
4142380	4143380	She's still writing books.
4143380	4145140	Medal of Honor.
4145140	4147180	Lots and lots of stuff coming out on the...
4147180	4152860	By the way, there is a Konami style special edition for Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold.
4152860	4155580	It probably comes with stickers and a bunch of useless crap.
4155580	4157060	Beatmania 14 Gold poster.
4157060	4161940	Oh, Beat Nation LEDs album and puzzle pieces.
4161940	4165780	And Beatmania 2DX premium live DVD, the Beat Nation Summit.
4165780	4166780	That'd be cool.
4166780	4169300	That'd be kind of cool.
4169300	4170460	I don't know.
4170460	4172780	I don't have the love for Beatmania that I used to have.
4172780	4177140	I think I got really disappointed that they gave up on it in the US.
4177140	4179500	I was really disappointed they gave up on it here.
4179500	4180500	They could have done a lot better.
4180500	4181900	Well, their biggest advocate left the company.
4181900	4184740	I guess that's true too.
4184740	4191860	On the Nintendo DS, 13SaiNo, Hello Work DS, Front Mission 2089, Border of Madness.
4191860	4192860	Another Sudoku game.
4192860	4193860	Front Mission's awesome.
4193860	4200420	Zombie Shiki, Yogo Ryoku Soushi Jutsu, English of the Dead.
4200420	4202420	Oh.
4202420	4203420	Good times.
4203420	4204420	That sounds like...
4204420	4205420	On the Nintendo DS.
4205420	4207660	I know it sounds like another game I'm thinking of.
4207660	4212100	On the Sony PSP, I always thought this was a pretty bitchin' band that Enya used to be
4212100	4216860	in, but Clannad, it comes out on the Sony PSP.
4216860	4218260	It was Enya's sister.
4218260	4220260	Was it Enya's sister?
4220260	4221260	Yeah.
4221260	4222260	Clannad.
4222260	4223260	Let's see.
4223260	4224260	What is this about?
4224260	4225260	Oh, God.
4225260	4228460	It's from this company that makes dating sim games.
4228460	4233300	Clannad has gone from Enya's sister to dating sims.
4233300	4238020	Memories Off and Valhalla Nights 2, all those are your Japanese release days.
4238020	4241100	After a pretty slow month in Japan, that's good that you guys are getting a lot of stuff
4241100	4244540	this week, so congrats.
4244540	4246100	Japan is a winner this week.
4246100	4251420	Honestly, I'd have to say that for the UK releases, the winning week had to have been
4251420	4256060	last week, so I do want to go ahead and mention a few things that are already out that people
4256060	4260700	should be getting or should have, and if they don't have Silent Hill Origins already, I'm
4260700	4261700	going to cry.
4261700	4266340	Dr. Mario and Germ Buster is out on Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, My Life as a King,
4266340	4272060	Lost Ones, Star Soldier R, those are all really good, and the Penny Arcade game, too, is actually
4272060	4273060	on the 21st.
4273060	4278860	Now, what we have coming out for this next release period... Oh, and by the way, they
4278860	4279860	got Rock Band.
4279860	4284220	All the good stuff's already out, so I don't see what the point is.
4284220	4285220	Yeah.
4285220	4286220	It was kind of an issue in the UK.
4286220	4289420	They got a really big delay on Rock Band, so it's just now making its way.
4289420	4297380	Well, coming out on the 30th, we have Death Junior, Root of Evil, Dream Pinball, Enemy
4297380	4304220	Territory Quake Wars, Monster Madness Grave Digger, Pool Party, Race Driver Grind, Supreme
4304220	4311940	Commander, Codename Panzers Cold War, and Jamster All-Stars.
4311940	4315340	Hopefully that's not the Jamster of the cell phone commercial kind.
4315340	4317420	Crazy frog, probably.
4317420	4319940	I'm going to look.
4319940	4320940	I have more of a curiosity.
4320940	4324500	Because if so, this game needs to be shot in the face.
4324500	4326700	If it is that same Jamster, shoot it in the face.
4326700	4328220	It needs to die in a fire.
4328220	4329220	Yes.
4329220	4330940	There are no... Well, Jamster's a company.
4330940	4337780	It's Crazy Frog, and they have plenty of Crazy Frog games in the Europe interface area.
4337780	4338780	Nothing yet.
4338780	4339780	That's it.
4339780	4340780	All right.
4340780	4341780	Let's get back into some gaming... It's over.
4341780	4342780	Let's get back to some gaming news.
4342780	4346540	Metal Gear Solid 4, I made a joke earlier about the long cut scenes, but it's really not a
4346540	4347620	joke.
4347620	4353180	Some of the cut scenes in Metal Gear Solid 4 are apparently up to 90 minutes long.
4353180	4355020	The good news is you can pause them.
4355020	4356020	Phew.
4356020	4357020	And that might be an exaggeration.
4357020	4358020	Yeah.
4358020	4362440	Also, the news came out this week that that might be a slight exaggeration that it's not
4362440	4366960	really 90 minute cut scenes, but I would bet it's probably like Lost... Because Lost Odyssey
4366960	4371660	had some fucking long cut scenes in it, but they were broken up like a little bit.
4371660	4373740	Like little bits here and there it was broken up.
4373740	4376260	So it's probably the same type of deal in Metal Gear Solid 4.
4376260	4379620	Where you play for a little bit.
4379620	4386740	Well, some other Metal Gear Solid 4 news is that Kojima is going to be in London signing
4386740	4388140	Sleeves.
4388140	4397320	So the release date is actually the 12th of June, and he is going to be around signing
4397320	4402580	... Let me see if it's going to be where he is at HMV's Oxford Street London store on
4402580	4405260	the 2nd of June to sign the copies.
4405260	4413260	So it's also not just Kojima, but Yohji Shinkawa is going to be there too.
4413260	4418780	And there's 300 sleeves available from the store on the day of the event, and it starts
4418780	4420300	at 9 o'clock AM.
4420300	4429060	So I will personally give whatever listener who gets me one a shout out and my undying
4429060	4437460	affection, and I'll send you clippings from the ferret.
4437460	4438920	Just so you know, they are just like sleeves.
4438920	4442820	It's not actually the game that he's signing since, you know.
4442820	4443820	That's why I said sleeves.
4443820	4446220	Wait, you're going to shave the ferret?
4446220	4448300	I said clippings.
4448300	4451060	Like maybe part of it's butt hair.
4451060	4452060	Shave the ferret.
4452060	4454060	That sounds like a mini game in WarioWare.
4454060	4455060	Shave!
4455060	4458060	That sounds dirty, Rob.
4458060	4461460	You're going to shave the ferret.
4461460	4467540	Earlier, Jamie and I were talking about OLR, the RPG, and you know how like Final Fantasy
4467540	4470220	has like the Tetra Master card games?
4470220	4474820	Instead of the card game, you could have shave the ferret, the mini game inside of the OLR
4474820	4475820	RPG.
4475820	4479020	Or that could be like the first quest, because you know the first quest is always something
4479020	4481260	pointless to introduce you to the game's mechanics.
4481260	4486700	I think the first quest should be like having to take the ferret out for a shave.
4486700	4492060	I was actually wanting to make a contest about whoever wanted to take like RPG Maker or something
4492060	4496140	and actually make an OLR RPG, like a full-fledged RPG.
4496140	4498020	I'd be right to try.
4498020	4499020	That would take a long time.
4499020	4500020	Yeah.
4500020	4501020	Exactly.
4501020	4502020	It would take a long time.
4502020	4506460	Well, personally I was going to talk about, well they should have, you know that game
4506460	4509660	coming out, Blastworks, the entire game is totally customizable.
4509660	4513100	We can make our own levels and stuff like that, plus they have a website that you can
4513100	4515780	upload it all to and you can download it, so.
4515780	4521500	There's a little bit more though about this, about getting the sleeves, they're not just
4521500	4522940	giving them out.
4522940	4528500	You will get a sleeve if you pre-order the game at HMV and the deposits for the game
4528500	4532300	is five pounds.
4532300	4533300	Five pounds?
4533300	4534300	Five quid.
4534300	4535300	All right.
4535300	4537300	Good lord, that's a lot of pounds.
4537300	4539500	All right.
4539500	4540500	Let's see.
4540500	4544340	Well, I don't know if I can be too excited about this because it is a sports game, but
4544340	4551260	Madden is going to be getting a bundle, a brand new PSP coming August 12th.
4551260	4555740	It's going to be a metallic blue PSP that's exclusive to the bundle.
4555740	4565260	With it for $200, you will be getting Madden 09, an NFL In Just One Play UMD, a voucher
4565260	4572380	to download the game Beats off the PlayStation Store, and a one gigabyte memory stick.
4572380	4575100	From the knowledge you play too many sports games.
4575100	4579220	I think it's kind of funny though that they include Beats on there, but you know, hey,
4579220	4581000	more power to them, I guess.
4581000	4588220	But that is coming August 12th, so yet another PSP bundle.
4588220	4591940	You know, our old friend of the show, Shane, is going to get this bundle simply because
4591940	4592940	the PSP is blue.
4592940	4593940	It's kind of sad.
4593940	4599620	Is he going to put High School Musical stickers all over it?
4599620	4600620	Probably.
4600620	4603580	Resident Evil 5, this game looks hot.
4603580	4605420	I don't know if you've seen the screenshots.
4605420	4606580	This game looks awesome.
4606580	4609980	It's got that whole over the shoulder thing from Resident Evil 4, but it's now on next
4609980	4614380	gen systems, and a hot game even gets hotter.
4614380	4618900	Apparently Resident Evil 5 is going to be featuring cooperative play mode, and that
4618900	4621820	means you can play co-op throughout the campaign.
4621820	4625860	There's going to be also cover system mechanics in the game, so you can actually lock to a
4625860	4628700	wall and then fire around corners.
4628700	4632220	If you're not actually playing in co-op mode, the other character in the game will be controlled
4632220	4633780	by the AI.
4633780	4634780	That's kind of interesting.
4634780	4638180	There's also going to be dodging that is done by the right analog stick, and apparently
4638180	4640800	the game is in these more open areas.
4640800	4642740	So this game sounds pretty awesome.
4642740	4646580	All this information, by the way, comes from an article that was on GamesRadar, but got
4646580	4647580	pulled.
4647580	4650180	Hmm, and you know what it means when articles get pulled.
4650180	4652300	They were true the whole time.
4652300	4653360	Trust us.
4653360	4654860	People die?
4654860	4657960	No, that too.
4657960	4661100	People don't die, they just get threatened and bullied a lot.
4661100	4664700	Again, trust us, we know.
4664700	4665700	I wouldn't know anything about it.
4665700	4669260	They get taken out in the back alley and beat up a little bit.
4669260	4672140	Well there's something else that should make some people happy too.
4672140	4679340	So if you get threatening letters from Capcom, you can go hide in another series, which is
4679340	4680340	Oddworld.
4680340	4684580	I know that there are fans of this series, I have not played them, but I know a lot of
4684580	4691100	people who love the Oddworld games.
4691100	4696180	And so the co-founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, said that he's working on another Oddworld
4696180	4697180	game.
4697180	4703020	It will feature new animation- Sorry, I got really mad, I decided to shoot
4703020	4704020	Loki.
4704020	4705020	Oh, okay.
4705020	4706020	Ow.
4706020	4708580	His foot hurts again.
4708580	4711380	I was loading something in advance, because I tried to work in advance.
4711380	4712380	Yeah, your gun!
4712380	4717260	Yes, I was loading my gun.
4717260	4718260	Can I finish reading now?
4718260	4719260	Christ.
4719260	4720260	All right, yes you can.
4720260	4721260	Sorry.
4721260	4723700	I didn't mean for that to happen.
4723700	4724700	Yeah, right.
4724700	4728400	Anyway, they're saying that basically the visuals are going to be about the same as
4728400	4732900	what you'd expect in a good CGI feature film.
4732900	4739180	This is, the quote says from Braun, the rendering tools are getting so good now for 3D animation
4739180	4743300	you can literally create a linear animation and create a video game using the exact same
4743300	4744300	objects.
4744300	4746180	That's pretty cool.
4746180	4750040	So I might have to check this one out myself, but they're basically saying that it could
4750040	4753720	be a few years before the project's complete.
4753720	4758340	They're also saying though, the hint is that the Oddworld games to be released in the future
4758340	4761900	are going to be episodic.
4761900	4764740	So that's kind of nifty.
4764740	4765740	All right.
4765740	4768380	It worked for Sam and Max.
4768380	4769980	Well speak of episodic.
4769980	4772700	It did not work for Shenmue.
4772700	4780300	Well speaking of episodic content, Horlor, you may remember them of the World of Warcraft,
4780300	4785700	apparently they got sued so they had to change their name, but Horlor, the fantasy porn series
4785700	4790340	that's out there now that is based off of World of Warcraft, now they're branching off
4790340	4795940	into a new online game to parody I guess in porn.
4795940	4802140	And that would be the Age of Conan with their brand new series, Horlor Presents, the Rage
4802140	4803620	of Bonan.
4803620	4811860	And it will actually feature the first episode, well lots of boning, but yeah the first episode
4811860	4815940	is apparently going to be a recreation of one of the missions that you go on in the
4815940	4821300	beginning of the game where you have to rescue some chick who is apparently tied up and then
4821300	4826260	accept and this, they have sex with her, so interesting.
4826260	4831340	But I mean, you know, they have some pretty interesting names for their episodes and stuff
4831340	4836160	like the first one, I remember Horlor, or World of Warcraft, the first one Rogues Do
4836160	4841580	It From Behind, gotta love that, and the nice Pirate Booty, yes.
4841580	4846220	But if you're interested and you're of age, you can download these and purchase them at
4846220	4848580	Horlor.com.
4848580	4852500	You know, I was just thinking, it's been a while since we've had a video game porn crossover
4852500	4856460	story because, you know, I was just, don't ask me why, but I was thinking the other day
4856460	4862100	about Final Fuck X and how hilarious that porno was, have you ever seen Final Fuck X?
4862100	4863100	This is great.
4863100	4864100	Remember Dance Dance Fuck?
4864100	4865380	It's basically boning some cosplayers.
4865380	4870720	Yes, it's basically, it's Japanese porno and it's basically these girls are dressed up
4870720	4875780	like Yuna and Riku and Lulu and they get fucked.
4875780	4879700	I don't think it's the Final Fuck though, I think the title's a little deceiving.
4879700	4881220	I have a feeling they get fucked again.
4881220	4884820	And in case you haven't ever seen these before, they do have pictures all night and they do
4884820	4889020	have the elf ears too, so it's like a, you know, a fanboy.
4889020	4895020	They're very, very great costumes, they're really, no seriously, it's just very, very
4895020	4896020	smart.
4896020	4901620	I remember one week, if you, in OLR history, I remember one week when we reviewed Dance
4901620	4905340	Dance Fuck live on air, because you actually got this porno somehow.
4905340	4909660	I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay, and I saw this and I'm like, I gotta
4909660	4911660	buy this.
4911660	4914180	There's actually a porno called Dance Dance Fuck, but they don't actually ever play Dance
4914180	4915180	Dance Revolution.
4915180	4921780	No, it has the font, and then it's like Dance Dance Fuck like six max or something.
4921780	4925660	Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck six max or something like that, it was so funny.
4925660	4931260	Until you've seen live action Smurf porn, you ain't seen shit.
4931260	4937100	But anyways, this company also, just so you know, they do have the first FPS porn as well.
4937100	4944140	They have FPS porn episode one, and it is done in the style of an FPS shooter, so.
4944140	4946140	One has to wonder what the gun is.
4946140	4947780	That is interesting.
4947780	4951780	Eight bucks, that's not bad.
4951780	4952780	Very nice.
4952780	4958260	That's the sound a lot of people will be making after watching it too.
4958260	4965060	Alright, anyhow, a sound I'm gonna make right now is a very happy noise, a very happy bouncy
4965060	4966060	noise.
4966060	4971020	Oh, oh, oh, real quick, sorry, and I forgot to add one thing.
4971020	4972020	You're interrupting his bouncy noise.
4972020	4973740	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
4973740	4978780	In the Age of Conan, they actually have a guild for Horlor as well, and if you wanna
4978780	4983740	sign up for their guild for Age of Conan, it's HorlorGuild.com.
4983740	4986140	So yes, you too can be part of the Horlor.
4986140	4987140	Nice.
4987140	4995100	Alright, anyhow, I said happy music, so it's time to bring in the music that always marks
4995100	4996900	our classic game of the week.
4996900	5000220	Yes, that's right, it's the segment where Dark Soccer digs through the archives and
5000220	5006180	picks a favorite classic game from gaming history to praise live here on air.
5006180	5009040	So Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?
5009040	5015540	The game that everybody should be playing is Typing of the Dead with bad voice acting.
5015540	5018540	Yes, and that was what the gunshot was from, I apologize.
5018540	5020540	The meeting G over there.
5020540	5021540	What?
5021540	5035980	Even the little baby voice sucks, but Typing of the Dead is a modification of House of
5035980	5042660	the Dead 2, which is the first person rail shooter, except in this one, phrases and words
5042660	5046860	pop up and you have to type them to kill them.
5046860	5051000	I've played an arcade version of this, it's quite difficult since I'm not too familiar
5051000	5058140	with a Japanese keyboard, but I have the Dreamcast version of this game that you play with the
5058140	5063300	Dreamcast keyboard and it's just really cracktastic and fun and kind of difficult really as you
5063300	5066820	get to the boss battles because you have to be really freaking fast.
5066820	5071620	On top of that you have to be really freaking accurate, because if you type wrong, then
5071620	5077620	it won't put it in until you type it correctly.
5077620	5082940	But I like that when they're walking around they have Dreamcasts on their back and keyboards
5082940	5085260	in front of them instead of carrying their guns around.
5085260	5088220	Unless you play the PC version, of course you can on game test.
5088220	5090780	PC versions kind of ask, but...
5090780	5092500	Hey, but it's all I got.
5092500	5098300	Yeah, I can bring over my Dreamcast one day, but anyway, Typing of the Dead was just really
5098300	5103380	fun, and it's so just...
5103380	5109700	I guess it's good, it's just absurd basically, it's stupid, but it's really fun.
5109700	5113260	And on top of that it has the worst voice acting ever which makes it even better.
5113260	5114260	My God.
5114260	5119540	I was like, there was nothing we could do.
5119540	5120540	It's that epic.
5120540	5121820	I don't want to die.
5121820	5125780	I remember playing a game like this once at Arcade Infinity, I don't know if it was still
5125780	5126780	Typing of the Dead.
5126780	5127780	No, the one they had was Typing of the Dead.
5127780	5128780	But it was in Japanese.
5128780	5129780	Yeah.
5129780	5130780	Okay.
5130780	5131780	But it was the same game, just in Japanese.
5131780	5139340	Well, the first few levels, if I do recall right, were mostly in English, but it was
5139340	5142820	as you get the boss battles that they were using the...
5142820	5147340	Yo, you could type, you could type, because they used English letters, it was just the
5147340	5150420	Japanese words, so you could type it, you could play through the game, but when you
5150420	5154300	got to the boss, there's one boss that asks questions, and that was the part where you
5154300	5158900	always got screwed.
5158900	5159900	So there you have it.
5159900	5167780	I also like that if you know how House of the Dead has little things you can find, well,
5167780	5171100	they actually pop up as a letter to the head, I think that's pretty cool.
5171100	5172100	That is cool.
5172100	5173100	I like that.
5173100	5174100	But I freaking love Typing of the Dead.
5174100	5177100	I think it's about time that this game got some respect.
5177100	5182060	All right, so there you have it, Typing of the Dead, your classic game of the week, available
5182060	5186380	on Dreamcast, which is the preferred version for Jamie, or PC, if you must.
5186380	5188260	Everything is better on Dreamcast.
5188260	5190540	All right.
5190540	5191540	Very good pick.
5191540	5193820	Again, I'm surprised that that has never been picked before.
5193820	5195940	Well, it hasn't been doing this that long.
5195940	5196940	I guess so.
5196940	5197940	But there you go.
5197940	5198940	All right.
5198940	5199940	Basically, you wanna know how we came across it?
5199940	5200940	How we decided to?
5200940	5201940	What's that?
5201940	5202940	Because we went in the vault.
5202940	5203940	Ah.
5203940	5204940	Went in the vault.
5204940	5205940	Tiara's nodding her head.
5205940	5206940	Did you make Tiara go in the vault?
5206940	5207940	Yeah.
5207940	5208940	Tiara's like, I was in the vault.
5208940	5209940	It was dark.
5209940	5210940	It was cold.
5210940	5211940	They tried to lock me in the vault.
5211940	5215780	I grabbed a stack of games.
5215780	5216780	And shot them in my head.
5216780	5217780	And just kept going through them.
5217780	5218780	Yeah, I did.
5218780	5219780	And it was fun.
5219780	5222180	But I kept going through them until I found Typing of the Dead.
5222180	5223180	All right.
5223180	5224820	But there were other games there that I might do later.
5224820	5227540	Well, that's gonna do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio.
5227540	5228540	But don't go away.
5228540	5232500	We got plenty more to come in part B. There's still some more gaming news that we're gonna
5232500	5233600	be talking about.
5233600	5234600	So stay tuned.
5234600	5236940	I mean, we haven't talked really about the Wii a whole lot yet.
5236940	5239540	There's a lot of Wii news going on this week.
5239540	5243300	Some other, the big piracy chip that's supposed to end piracy all together.
5243300	5244300	We're gonna talk about that.
5244300	5246740	I'm sure Loki has something he wants to say about that.
5246740	5247740	And movies.
5247740	5249740	Lots of game movie crossovers.
5249740	5256700	And yes, the whole Xbox shenanigans around the guy whose name happened to be kinda gay.
5256700	5260500	We'll talk about that all in part B after a quick break.
5260500	5263500	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5263500	5268020	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
5268020	5269020	a week.
5269020	5273260	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
