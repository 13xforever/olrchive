13899	18103	Tonight, May 25th, 2008, is Killer Instinct gonna make a comeback?
18464	24490	A new computer chip promises to end piracy forever, and will the 360 go without an update this spring?
31465	36187	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36227	43269	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43389	50872	And yeah, we were out last week so we didn't have a show and part B from the week before took forever to get to the podcast feed, but it's all better now.
51172	51712	All better.
52212	54053	We're fixed and ready to go.
54573	55833	My name is Rob Roberts.
55913	56974	I'm ready to go tonight.
57034	60335	Hopefully the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also ready to go tonight.
61948	63329	Are you well-oiled and ready to go?
65170	65910	You know, like a machine.
67030	67911	I've had a hamburger.
67931	68491	Does that count?
68751	69311	Sure, that works.
69491	69732	Okay.
70112	72293	Then I'm well-greased and ready to go to the bathroom.
72413	72733	All right.
72793	74153	Sounds not hot.
74574	74914	All right.
75034	77295	Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.
78115	78495	Hello.
78775	80656	And are you well-oiled and ready to go?
81597	81897	Sure.
82057	82337	All right.
83871	85273	You had a Subway sandwich earlier.
85633	87216	How long was that Subway sandwich?
87236	88577	That was like a two foot long sandwich.
88678	90460	It was a foot long, okay.
90700	94605	And it was with the wrong bread because apparently the Subway was out of white bread.
94666	96288	That sandwich was bigger than my foot.
96808	97930	It was not a foot long sandwich.
97950	99252	That was a foot long sandwich.
99292	99532	Alright.
99953	100193	Anyhow.
100674	100874	Sorry.
101855	104117	We are turning into Orange Lounge Foodio yet again.
104537	113946	All right, joining us as well in studio, we have some guests tonight, which is good because we haven't had a lot of guests recently, and I've had to suffer this entire show with only Jamie and Matt.
114747	117369	However, we have some guests tonight to help break that up a little bit.
117889	122033	Joining us all the way from Las Vegas is Tiara.
123094	123414	How are you?
124255	125616	I can has American cheeseburger.
125796	127458	Yes, you can has American cheeseburger.
127858	128759	How are you doing?
129958	130678	I am very good.
130738	133699	I got nauseous on the way here, but now I'm fine.
133940	134460	Sorry to hear that.
134480	135500	You are very, very quiet.
135520	136881	They're having a hard time hearing you, so don't be afraid.
136901	138321	You've got to get that thing real close to your mouth.
138561	141402	Because remember, it's normally wired for Jamie, who can get kind of loud.
141803	142983	All right, yeah, that's right.
143203	143763	I'm just teasing.
144784	146044	All right, well, we're glad to have you.
146444	147865	So you feel free to chime in whenever.
147925	148685	Take Jamie's mic.
148745	149305	I encourage it.
149526	150186	I'm just kidding.
151220	152721	I don't know why I'm giving Jamie a hard time tonight.
152801	153441	I heart Jamie.
153761	154281	She knows that.
154822	155002	Right?
155042	155462	You know that?
156182	157723	I'm going to throw that ferret in the fire.
158143	161465	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Drew Nami.
162125	162525	Rar.
162765	163326	How are you doing, Drew?
163866	165307	I'm rar.
165567	166147	You're rar?
166747	167368	Sorry to hear that.
167528	170409	I like the interactive radio that was going on before the show, by the way.
170669	171590	Here's what happened.
171810	173190	We're live on Justin TV.
173250	178313	We do our cam thing, although I got to tell you, the cam kind of sucks tonight because I dropped...
179173	181974	The Eyesight Webcam, and the audio doesn't work anymore.
182315	183395	Good job breaking it, Zero.
183635	193100	It's having to use the actual audio from that little tiny mic thing on the actual, like if you look at the right side of the Mac, but you can see the little tiny mic thing, that's what it's using.
193180	195020	So our Justin TV is kind of hurting tonight.
195381	199843	But I guess one of our listeners actually saw that you were here and called your phone and got you to leave the room.
201112	202593	Ranma, you fucking suck.
202893	204975	I'd just like to make that known.
205796	208057	But Orange Lounge Radio is interactive radio.
208117	211660	It's the best thing ever because we get to interact with you guys.
211700	212080	We love it.
212421	213521	And you can join us in chat.
213561	218125	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com or our chat channel is Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.
218565	221807	or you can always send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
221827	224489	I think we have a pretty full mailbag tonight, though, because it's been two weeks.
224549	226190	So you may not want to send them just yet.
226530	228191	Wait until during the week.
228651	233534	And also our Skype line, which will be open later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
233954	237397	But it would not be Orange Launch Radio if we didn't talk about our gaming week.
237457	242079	And since we've got some time to catch up on, tonight's question is, how was your gaming two weeks?
242800	244481	So, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming two weeks?
244775	250516	We played rock band today and I played pinball a lot.
251316	255757	I went to Pinnagogo the weekend before.
256157	256937	How was Pinnagogo?
257017	258978	Because we didn't get to hear about it because we were out that week.
259178	264659	It was hot, smelly, and hot and smelly.
264999	266779	Do pinball players not bathe or something?
267760	274001	I don't know, but this was at Dixon Farm Center of something or the other with Banquet Hall.
274710	279253	Yeah, when most people call Sacramento a cow town, you're actually probably thinking of Dixon.
280153	280453	Moo.
282775	283055	Anyway.
284016	294582	But I did get to play the Black Rose before it went down, and Dan brought his No Fear, and Will brought Judge Dredd, which is not my favorite table, but anyway.
294602	303848	I tried to go back and play some really old stuff and some things I hadn't seen before, but I could not get on Theater of Magic at all.
304688	322417	and no one brought like a medieval madness there was an Adams family there nice but it was by this point it's a lot of machines that I know if I want to play them we know the people who own them so what exactly happens at Pinnagogo you pay money to get in and just play all the pinball you want or is it more of like it's supposed to be like a trade show for pinball enthusiasts
323533	328277	You've got your center area, which is all, in fact, there's actually two rooms.
328337	332040	The main room is where the newer tables are set up.
332420	335122	The one with more, you know, I guess componentry and things.
335662	340206	Then there's an air-conditioned dining hall that has older machines set up in there.
341107	345870	And I'm talking like, you know, 60s, you know, 50s, 60s, 70s machines.
347491	353236	But you basically, they're all put on free play and you pay your convention dues and you run around and, you know,
354025	374117	Frolick Frolick in the hot But around the sides they have vendors set up People who sell old tables that need some work Like a friend of ours got a Space Invaders pinball Nice For like 150 bucks It needs to be shopped really bad Does it have the groovy music from the new soundtrack?
374317	379980	I don't know It should No, probably not It's old Probably not then And creepy looking too Um
382631	384512	There are a couple of machines I did play quite a bit of.
384532	386093	Did they have the Jurassic Park pinball?
386113	388815	That was one of my favorites because the dinosaur would come down and eat the ball.
388995	389136	No.
389156	389976	That was always my favorite.
391257	393839	It had Funhaus, which I hate because that head scares me.
394379	396701	But it had Captain Fantastic.
397321	398502	Captain Fantastic.
398522	400323	Which is the one with Elton John on it.
400543	401844	It was the machine and Tommy.
402505	402805	Oh, yeah.
402845	403686	He's fantastic.
403746	404066	All right.
404680	405461	I have a picture of it.
405481	406201	I'll put it on the cam.
406241	406942	Fantastic.
407082	417248	But I did play, one of my favorite was Black Hole, which the cool thing about Black Hole is that you have an underside that you play under the field and you play it reversed.
417608	418929	Oh, I've seen something like that.
418969	424393	I don't think it was, I think it was like, isn't there a swamp thing or a creature from the swamp or something that has something like that?
424413	425253	An Elvira machine does it.
425313	425793	Okay, okay.
425914	431057	But Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is what's in my house, just has a hologram of...
431757	433418	Oh, okay, now I'm thinking of something else.
433458	434258	All right, that's fine.
434358	449726	But Black Hole's a pretty nifty machine, but Dan finally got to play Black Rose, which is the one I want, which I think is much cooler than the new Pirates of the Caribbean game, which was there, and Family Guy, and Simpsons Pinball Party, which I have.
450887	451707	And no pinbot.
451727	453328	There's a bride.
453588	456269	You know what pinball game I haven't played in forever that I want to play again?
456990	457770	Revenge of the Gator.
458752	459772	That was the Game Boy one.
459852	460113	I know.
460613	462674	That was the first game I ever played with a link cable.
462874	464054	That one was fantabulous.
464294	465795	It was fantabulous.
466375	473398	Overall, it was a really good convention, but we ended up splitting so that we could go to Mary's Pizza Shack.
474258	474498	Nice.
474598	475659	Where we didn't eat pizza.
475719	476579	We ate breadsticks.
477239	477979	And I had a milkshake.
478240	478560	The end.
479000	479260	Alright.
480515	482036	Loki, how was your gaming two weeks?
483817	491481	Well, week one I played pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto 4 because I was attempting to go for 100% by that deadline.
492281	500685	And not to say that I didn't try because I took two days off work, played solid for four days, and still didn't finish it in time.
503211	505573	It just got to the point where it wasn't even fun to play it anymore.
506133	510977	It's fun to play it now, though, but not fun to just do all the side missions and stuff.
510997	512838	And I'm still going to do 100% eventually.
512898	514779	It's just right now I'm like at 86.
515200	521324	So I have to kill all the pigeons and do stunts and stuff like that.
522619	528684	Uh, then I played a little bit of, um, Wii Fit this week, and that's alright.
528764	532406	You know, the balance board, it's not as fun as you would think it would be.
532627	538891	It really, it, I don't know, it's just kind of stupid, some of the games that are on there.
539191	542414	And they're not really responsive, but whatever.
542914	548458	And then, um, tried a little bit of, um,
549378	551519	The Penny Arcade Game, and that was pretty fun.
551699	554740	Wait, I have to ask, when you got on the balance board, did it go, ow?
555240	556140	No, it didn't go, ow.
556861	558481	It's all, you're obese.
560242	561963	Did your wife make fun of you when she was watching you play?
562103	562263	No.
563243	566224	Yeah, she was watching me play, but, you know, I don't know, it was just fun.
567184	573407	But then, you know, it said my Wii Fit age was 38, so I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
574387	574527	Okay.
576107	579428	Tried a bunch of the mini-games on there, like the jogging and stuff.
581128	590410	Apparently, Extifer and my wife said that the female trainer on there has a giant bulge.
591430	592871	Like, she's got a package.
593511	593791	What?
594351	600352	Yeah, apparently the female trainer is carrying some extra equipment.
601632	601933	I don't know.
602213	603153	Kind of weird stuff there.
603413	603813	But, um...
605723	609264	Yeah, pretty much that was my gaming week because that's all I've been really playing.
610284	611565	Multiplayer is still kind of fun.
612105	622628	It's hit and miss though with the accuracy on it because you'll be aiming at someone's head and for whatever reason it really favors if you crouch down when you're firing and stuff.
623048	623368	I don't know.
623428	624668	It's just kind of cheap.
624828	630010	It's not as fun as you would have hoped it but it's not as broken as the PSP version so that's also fun.
631270	631370	Um
632922	634183	That's pretty much it right now.
634243	640006	I'm still trying to get my audio video set up to work so I can record some funny stuff.
640146	650271	We were playing with some people and there's a bunch of skate parks in there and you can take the motorcycles on the half pipes and stuff and do funny things with that.
651631	652772	Just all sorts of weird stuff.
655385	661408	Well, my gaming week, you know, I was kind of sick last week, which you would think I would stay home and play games all day, but I really didn't.
661508	664850	Although I did, you know, it's, gosh, it's been a while since we've had a show.
664890	668671	I mean, you miss a week, miss a lot, because we haven't done a show since WiiWare came out.
668731	671553	Like, that was, like, our last show was, what, May 11th?
671633	674174	And so literally the next day was when WiiWare came out.
674454	675375	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
706474	709457	Yeah, so that was amusing.
709517	710998	Defend Your Castle is very amusing.
711359	713140	It's very slow in the beginning.
713341	715603	You kind of have to stick with it for it to get really chaotic.
716183	722569	And the kind of bummer thing about Defend Your Castle is that once you've kind of upgraded your castle fully, there's not really a lot left to do.
722910	725952	You just have to let it keep getting faster and faster and faster.
726593	735682	But it's only a $5 game and, you know, compared to some of the $5 stinkers on Xbox Live, $5 is a fair price for the game.
736002	738665	I think it would be a fun party game too and it's obscenely simple.
739005	742508	I mean, it's cool to bring friends over and be all, okay, here's what you do.
742588	745391	Pick up the guys with your controller and then throw them up in the air and watch them die.
745751	747873	I mean, that's, what fun is that?
747953	749335	Instant party, just add death.
750135	751717	So yeah, Defend Your Castle is kind of cool.
752577	755780	It's not a game that's going to amuse you on a long-term basis, though.
755840	769211	If you're kind of like a single player looking for some games that are going to keep you involved for a long time, from what I understand, you should probably go with Lost Winds or the Final Fantasy game, neither of which I've checked out yet because I'm out of space on my Wii Drive.
770579	770979	I know that.
770999	772560	Completely out of space.
772680	773601	It doesn't take much.
774642	775302	Jeez.
776743	779625	So, but anyway, I'll save that bitching for another day.
780425	783267	Otherwise, I did check out the Penny Arcade game for a little bit.
783367	786809	I only checked out the demo, so I'm not going to try to give a full review of the game.
787170	788510	But I did laugh my ass off.
788550	790051	Like, I thought the game was very amusing.
790372	792213	The gameplay itself, you know...
793117	795878	I've seen it before, but I was amused.
795938	798820	And I'm sure fans of the comic are going to be insanely amused.
799360	801641	I hear it's short, but you know what?
802681	804802	How much does it cost to see a movie these days?
804902	808404	Like $10 to go see a movie for 90 minutes?
808524	813726	It makes $20 for four hours of entertainment not seem so bad.
813807	817868	I am going to put down the money to buy it when I have a little more time to actually sit down and play it.
819269	820070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
846750	850934	So otherwise, other games I've played, not a lot of new stuff.
850994	854337	I went back and played some old retro stuff, some old Xbox Live Arcade games.
854717	855277	That's really it.
857139	860002	Tiara, I see you're playing a PSP right now.
860062	860882	What are you up to?
860922	862023	How's your gaming weeks?
862063	862664	What have you been playing?
863325	866649	Well, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP.
867170	873539	It's kind of interesting because I've played the PSX version through so many times.
873559	877764	And it's interesting to see how they've rewritten the script and everything.
878445	882968	Is it supposed to be like an upgrade of the original PlayStation 1, or is it like a whole new story?
883308	885249	Because I never really understood.
885850	887771	This one is the exact same game.
888011	895095	They've redone the translation, and now everybody talks like Thor from Marvel Comics.
895355	895676	Okay.
896576	903220	And some of the cut scenes are now animated, so it's kind of interesting.
903360	903520	Cool.
903540	904261	There's cameos.
904861	905061	Yes.
906082	911004	And there are two new classes that you can get, Onion Night and Dark Night.
912064	914085	And so it's been pretty interesting so far.
914125	917787	I'm only in the third chapter, but so far everything is pretty much the same.
918007	927531	The translation is slightly different, and so since the text is different, I'm sort of thrown off by it because I'm so used to seeing the cheesy old translations.
927611	940159	I was like, when I played Final Fantasy IV on the Game Boy Advance for the first time, I was like, whoa, whoa, this is way different from what I remember on Super Nintendo, because they really dumbed it down on Super Nintendo, but thank heavens they kept you Spoonie Bard in there, that made me happy.
940319	943941	I was like, I had to play at least to that spot, to see like, did they keep Spoonie Bard?
943981	944201	Yes?
944221	944502	Okay.
945522	951486	Yeah, other than that, I bought myself Iron Man for the PSP, and I've been playing that a little bit.
951626	955529	I actually wrote a review for that, and it's in the mailbag, so I'm sure Jamie will read it later.
955809	956009	Nice.
956029	956109	Nice.
958328	959429	and other than that, that's it.
959809	960069	All right.
960129	962871	I noticed your PSP is very shiny, by the way.
962911	964833	You take good care of that PSP, don't you?
965373	967595	You sign on that or something.
967615	968776	It's very, very well kept.
969076	969376	Yeah.
970077	971458	Well, I just got it last month.
971478	971938	That's why.
971958	979484	Because it was like a kind of preemptive tax refund gift to myself.
979504	981925	I know the government's giving me $600, so why not?
981965	982646	Yeah, exactly.
982666	984267	And then I have like my little shield on it.
984347	986609	And so it's, you know, that's why it's shiny.
987202	987622	Very nice.
988363	989044	Isn't it shiny?
989524	989724	Yes.
989784	991266	That's one thing I noticed about the PSP.
991526	992827	It's shiny.
993908	996250	Drew, anything shiny in your gaming week?
996871	997772	Not particularly.
997852	1000935	I've been playing some Rock Band today.
1001235	1002936	Did okay, I think.
1005179	1006960	Other than that, not much.
1007501	1007521	I...
1008462	1012924	Tinkered with La Mulana, but I guess I'm just not that hardcore anymore.
1013544	1022688	Okay, somebody needs to explain La Mulana with me, because I know we have tons of chatters that are obsessed with this game and have been trying to get me to play, so sell me on La Mulana.
1022728	1023668	What's so rad about it?
1023828	1028170	In a nutshell, it's like a recreation of an MSX game.
1030484	1031624	Obscenely difficult.
1031844	1046887	It's an action-adventure, and basically the goal is you're like this Indiana Jones-type archaeologist, and you want to discover all the secrets in an ancient city called La Milana.
1048648	1050748	Unfortunately, almost everything is a trap.
1050808	1056869	It's not I want to be the guy hard, but it's definitely Battletoads hard.
1057489	1058930	That would be a great name for a game.
1059070	1060050	Everything is a trap.
1063487	1068949	I'm not sure if that would be like, I don't know if you ever saw the movie Cube like that as a video game.
1068969	1069229	Hypercube.
1069249	1070950	We were just discussing this earlier today.
1071830	1073211	Hypercube breaks my mind.
1073931	1075292	Everything is a trap.
1076092	1076712	It's a trap.
1077773	1078213	I like that.
1078893	1079574	That's a good name.
1081174	1082795	Add that to our wish list.
1083055	1087897	I don't know if it's able to add to the OLR wish list because I'm not sure what the game is yet.
1088579	1089440	That's the point.
1089780	1090841	You don't know what it is.
1090941	1092122	Oh, because it's a trap.
1092983	1093464	Okay.
1095305	1096406	Okay, yeah, then I approve.
1096526	1097708	It can go on the All Our Wish list.
1098128	1100991	And aside from that, I've actually been playing through Metal Gear Solid 2.
1101851	1108117	I sort of gave up on the game a couple years ago because I suck at stealth games, and now I find I'm actually progressing.
1108818	1114223	Maybe it's the fact that I'm now playing on Very Easy, but Raiden is not annoying as I thought it would be.
1116789	1117529	It's kind of interesting.
1117549	1120511	Isn't it weird when you rediscover games that were out like five years ago?
1121852	1122152	Yeah.
1122472	1124053	Yeah.
1124434	1129156	Or like ten years ago in the case when I was really sick and I was at my parents' I was playing Soul Blazer.
1129877	1130577	Oh, God.
1130617	1131438	Soul Blazer is awesome.
1131458	1132378	Soul Blazer is awesome.
1132558	1134960	Soul Blazer needs to come to Virtual Console for reals.
1135340	1145166	Like, I don't think this made our show roll tonight, but I understand there was a little bit of shenanigans on the internets this week because I guess Kotaku had posted, we want...
1146670	1155957	This game, we want Soul Blazer to come to Virtual Console, and somehow that got reported on G4 as Soul Blazer is on Virtual Console.
1156558	1157378	That was kind of funny.
1157939	1158619	That was very funny.
1158639	1160041	But I agree with the guy who wrote it.
1160061	1164544	Soul Blazer does need to come to Virtual Console, as does Illusion of Gaia, as does Terranigma.
1165565	1166105	Thank you very much.
1167546	1170309	Are you going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4 at some point, Junami?
1170529	1173151	And the 50-hour cutscenes are supposed to be in the game?
1174002	1175244	Yeah, if I can afford a PS3.
1175264	1177027	Are you going to be watching Metal Gear Solid?
1177328	1179251	I shouldn't ask people if they're going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4.
1179331	1180593	I should say, are you going to be watching it?
1180794	1182937	No, I'll be busy watching Xenisaga.
1183478	1183718	Okay.
1185788	1186729	I'll stick to my Tales of games for now.
1186749	1188130	I'm stoked for the Tales of Symphonia sequel for Wii.
1188150	1188230	Soon.
1188250	1188330	Yeah.
1214019	1215600	If you're in Japan, you might see it next year.
1216761	1216961	Yeah.
1217722	1217982	Anyhow.
1218503	1223266	All right, let's get to gaming news after we take care of some housekeeping tonight.
1223827	1225088	First off, sorry about last week.
1225128	1225768	We weren't here.
1226849	1235276	We decided we were going to put out Part B of the May 11th show a little late just to kind of spread it out when we realized there wasn't going to be a show last week.
1235356	1238519	But then it ended up getting out really, really late, and that was my bad.
1238539	1239239	So sorry about that.
1239259	1241301	But it is up now, Parts A and B of last week's show.
1243095	1244817	Grand Theft Auto 4 contest.
1244857	1252467	If you listened to last week's show, you know that SSJ100Matt won our nomination into the finals for the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest.
1252887	1254329	I don't know who won yet.
1254389	1257853	What I can tell you is that it didn't end up being a public vote.
1258114	1259055	That's not how they did it.
1259395	1260156	Thank you for watching!
1289059	1294943	Like, I don't think any of us had, like, any similarities in our list whatsoever.
1295023	1298686	Like, DarkSakura, I think, had the Chatterbox show on her list.
1299126	1302268	And Loki had the one with all the dick jokes on his list.
1302288	1302788	Which one was that?
1302828	1303809	Was that the Platform Nation one?
1303829	1304449	Why am I not surprised?
1304469	1307071	That's because it was the most like a Grand Theft Auto commercial.
1307131	1308032	No, no, I know.
1308752	1309913	And what did I have?
1309993	1313576	I had Video Game Outsiders on my list.
1313916	1314456	I remember that.
1314937	1315117	But...
1316641	1322945	In the end, the only one that actually ended up on all three of our lists was the All Games Interactive one.
1322965	1324286	So that's what we ended up voting for.
1324966	1332931	And I don't have the MP3 handy, but it's really great because what they did is they cropped Mayor Young, who's on that show.
1333652	1337774	I guess he was having one of those I'm all alone on the radio.
1337874	1342057	Did you ever see Wayne's World when Garth was all alone having to do the show?
1342077	1342117	No.
1344102	1350626	I guess Mary Young was having one of those moments and somebody actually remixed it to music and it's hilarious.
1351107	1355670	He's actually singing like, I am alone on the feed.
1356750	1357631	It was really funny.
1357671	1358912	Oh wait, look, I found it, I found it.
1358952	1360473	Okay, here's the one we voted for to win.
1360493	1360773	Here it is.
1361954	1370960	I am alone on the feed and that's all.
1374929	1375891	It's just me.
1376552	1377213	I'm alone.
1379176	1387789	I am alone on the field and that's all.
1390660	1391481	I'm not going to play the whole thing.
1391521	1392982	You can listen to their show if you want to hear the whole thing.
1393002	1394864	But it was really funny, so we voted for it.
1394964	1398887	Even though, nowhere in there do they ever say it's all games interactive or any of that.
1398907	1401970	And it really has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto, but it was funny.
1402331	1405613	You ever see that movie, Shockers, right before the guy's head exploded?
1408374	1411616	I do know... I don't think we've gotten a single vote so far.
1411716	1412257	Poor Matt.
1412677	1420642	The problem is, if it had been... See, we kind of got screwed by how they decided to do the finals, which is fine, because we didn't know how they were going to do it going into it.
1420702	1421642	We knew it could be anything.
1422023	1426906	But with a public vote, at least we could have mobilized the OL Army, and I think Matt would have done pretty well.
1427206	1432789	But the problem with having the other shows vote is I don't think they all listened to Orange Lounge Radio.
1432809	1436632	I don't think they all listened to the rules of the contest either, because some of those entries, I was like...
1437032	1437552	and DarkSakura.
1456966	1458186	Wait, this just in.
1458747	1461648	Apparently, Bobby Blackwolf voted for our show to win.
1462108	1464209	So, praise Bobby Blackwolf.
1464629	1465610	Wait, no one listens.
1465650	1466831	What do you think this is, the internet?
1466991	1468852	So we know at least Matt won't get last place.
1468892	1474054	But see, Bobby probably liked it because Bobby listens to our show, so he got it.
1474995	1476576	But I doubt the other shows are going to get it.
1476856	1477576	So we'll see.
1479017	1479317	Alright.
1480447	1481768	Moving on, moving on.
1481888	1482128	Enough.
1482348	1483809	We'll let you know who actually wins next week.
1484109	1492933	I do want to give one more shout-out to the All Games crew right now because there's a gal on there who I think we've all met, Jessica.
1493334	1494114	Have you guys met Jessica?
1494274	1495375	We've all met Jessica before, right?
1497075	1497856	I don't know.
1497896	1499196	I think she was there at E3 one year.
1499216	1502698	She's the pretty gal who reads the news and all that stuff on their show.
1502718	1503579	Well, that could be anybody.
1503599	1505059	Yeah.
1506340	1517829	Jessica is cool and she actually apparently is like, okay, I did not even know this was going on, but there's this website, Massify.com, where they're actually casting a horror movie online.
1518210	1519811	Like people made YouTube-ish videos.
1519831	1521212	You sound like you said a horror movie.
1521432	1523694	No, a horror, horror movie online.
1523995	1525616	Well, Jessica was a finalist.
1525856	1541429	her thing was so popular she was one of the top 20 one of the top 10 girls they had her do a screen test and now she's a finalist and if she wins this she's gonna be in a movie she's gonna be in a horror movie she's gonna be victim number how much?
1542257	1542617	I don't know.
1543038	1544719	Apparently, it's like a lead role if she wins this.
1544739	1545339	That's pretty cool.
1545439	1546340	That is very cool.
1546700	1548882	I hope, though, she has a no nudity clause in her contract.
1548942	1549542	She's a pretty girl.
1549562	1550663	They'll try to take advantage of that.
1550683	1552504	So, Jessica, no nudity clause.
1552944	1554325	You better write that in your contract.
1554685	1562110	But anyway, if you want to vote for Jessica, we encourage you to Massify.com slash auditions slash 739.
1562471	1565433	And I think you can only vote till Monday.
1565853	1568735	Her name is Shantus on the site, so that's how you'll know.
1568835	1571317	And I'll post that there in chat, so you all can go vote.
1572137	1576739	You do have to register for the site, and they send verification emails.
1576959	1580300	But come on, in this day and age, who doesn't have a spam email account that all goes to?
1580881	1582321	I just registered with my spam email account.
1583862	1588523	Katamaris Forever in chat says, the ferret will be in it as the slasher also.
1589744	1591465	Now that's an idea for a horror movie.
1592085	1594466	Maybe that could go in the everything is a trap game.
1595580	1598042	Maybe the ferret is the mastermind behind all the traps.
1598383	1599664	I didn't know the ferret liked Slash.
1599684	1600445	It would be wonderful.
1601165	1601426	All right.
1601926	1602186	Anyhow.
1602727	1603668	So go vote for Jessica.
1603708	1604308	Make her happy.
1605429	1607611	Well, we also want to say we know somebody in a horror movie.
1609473	1609713	All right.
1609974	1613016	Again, I just hope they wrote the nudity out because that would be awkward.
1613177	1615359	Like, oh, hi, Jessica.
1615379	1616740	I think I saw you naked in a movie.
1616760	1617381	That's kind of awkward.
1617741	1618041	All right.
1619222	1619843	Moving on.
1621294	1624119	because chicks get naked in horror movies all the time.
1624199	1629189	So I'm just hoping she pulled a Jamie Lee Curtis and said not going to happen.
1629509	1629810	All right.
1630130	1631493	Anyhow, let's get it.
1631753	1633857	Tiara's very amused by the nudity talk.
1635730	1641772	Look, if you were cast for a horror movie, Tiara, wouldn't you make them write a no boobie clause in the contract?
1641792	1643793	Nobody would want to see me naked anyways.
1643813	1647675	I know, I'm sure there's plenty of boys that would like to see the ta-tas, but, you know.
1647795	1650396	Yes, because, you know, guys are really selective on the TV.
1651716	1652076	I know.
1652617	1652897	All right.
1652917	1654538	It's like, oh, man.
1654678	1656519	I got to look at... Moving on.
1656579	1657239	Gaming news.
1657279	1659381	We do do gaming on this show once in a while, yes?
1659781	1660761	I know nothing.
1661042	1662382	We got a week to catch up on.
1662442	1663223	Loki, catch us up.
1663263	1666285	What did we miss from the week of the 11th through the 18th when we were gone?
1666665	1668366	Absolutely nothing.
1669548	1675513	Except for the news for last week, including there was a bunch of gaming events that went on.
1675993	1677795	Lots of stuff that we weren't invited to, of course.
1678715	1682618	And so we have a few different Gamers Days.
1683539	1685881	Of course, one we like to talk about, Konami.
1686121	1687662	They had their Gamer Day recently.
1688543	1696429	And they announced a few things, including Rock Revolution, their journey back into, I guess...
1697230	1701512	The Guitar Drum Music Game, you know, because they've never been there before.
1702392	1706193	It's like, you know, oh my god, they finally arrived.
1706774	1707694	About time.
1709855	1717337	But yes, not to be outdone by, you know, some other companies who have put out certain games with drums.
1717517	1721119	They decided, hey, our drum thing's not going to look like a drum at all.
1721499	1723960	And it's going to have like six buttons and
1724540	1726602	We're going to be awesome because we're going to one-up everybody.
1727063	1740918	So yeah, six drum pads, one kick drum, and it looks like 40 songs with download content planned, as well as the ability to record your own songs in a jam session with eight separate tracks.
1741499	1745463	Online co-op versus Battle of the Bands mode, and...
1746759	1748920	a weird drum pad.
1749501	1755244	We actually have the first confirmed song for the new Konami drum guitar.
1755284	1755864	What's it called again?
1755904	1756625	Rock Revolution?
1756765	1756965	Yeah.
1757065	1758746	We have the first confirmed song.
1773484	1774645	No, I missed the bus.
1774845	1776226	You missed the bus, Konami.
1776446	1777266	You stole my joke.
1777386	1778127	You missed the bus.
1779288	1780228	Konami, you know what this is?
1781989	1784551	It's the sound of the boat you missed five years ago.
1784731	1786552	I just can't help but look at this and go...
1787682	1790003	Wow, that's, I guess, yay?
1790483	1790823	Yay?
1790883	1794423	About time that you figured out, oh my god, rock and roll?
1794503	1796864	I feel horrible saying this about Konami.
1796944	1804466	I feel really horrible saying this about Konami because, you know, they did kind of start the whole guitar, I mean, they did it.
1804866	1808526	They're like, but if only we could develop a guitar and drum game.
1808787	1809547	Can we do that?
1809607	1810867	And then like two years later...
1811187	1813149	Oh my god, we had one all along!
1813749	1814890	Why didn't you tell me?
1815491	1824438	Years ago on this program, and I think we've all said this, years ago on this program, we said Konami is going to miss the bus by not putting this game out here.
1824498	1825719	Somebody's going to beat them to it.
1826220	1828522	And I'll be damned if we weren't right.
1829462	1830764	And that's how they innovate on it.
1830804	1837409	They make this really weird looking drum pad that looks like some cheesy toy, and then they like...
1839645	1839965	I don't know.
1840265	1841506	I can't imagine how this is going to be.
1841526	1846147	The US R&D people at Konami are pissing themselves and shooting themselves in the foot.
1846287	1851629	Well, you know, they got to diversify themselves somehow because now the market's really getting crowded.
1851649	1852249	I got an idea.
1852369	1853250	Fix Beatmania.
1854070	1856231	Beatmania is a great idea.
1856751	1858151	There are people that are so obsessive about Beatmania.
1858191	1862853	They're going to miss the bus on that again, too, because there's that whole DJ hero that they're talking about putting out.
1863753	1866254	Once again, they're going to get beat by these other people.
1866274	1868275	Doesn't Sega have the US license for Kraken DJ?
1869011	1871674	I'm not sure, but I could totally see this song in Beatmania.
1884366	1884646	Everything.
1885326	1890709	Anyways, so yeah, they announced that game as well as some other games which I'm sure no one has ever heard of.
1891149	1891709	Hold on, hold on.
1891770	1893630	AJ Mix asked a really good question in chat.
1893670	1895771	Does anyone really want Rock Revolution?
1896272	1896792	What do you think?
1896912	1900634	I mean, is this something... I mean, I guess the answer is if it's a good game, sure.
1901653	1906315	Yeah, but that's just like saying I don't really want Guitar Hero 4 either or Guitar Hero World Tour.
1906355	1907395	Did you cover Guitar Hero yet?
1907716	1907836	No.
1907936	1909997	Okay, talk Guitar Hero because I got something I want to add to this.
1910017	1915439	Okay, Guitar Hero World Tour, which I don't even know why they're calling Guitar Hero anymore because now they've added drums.
1915699	1922742	They were supposed to be more realistic because now they have two cymbals that are up top, and then they have three drum pads as well.
1922802	1929985	So you have five, so you're immediately better than Rock Band because now you have one additional drum pad.
1930346	1931759	and they also have a kick drum as well.
1932933	1939878	And apparently they're going to be pressure sensitive, so if you hit them harder, the sound's louder.
1940098	1940398	Yippee.
1941039	1945942	And then the guitar's changed again, but it's basically just another redesign.
1946002	1948644	It's still five buttons, all that fun stuff.
1949625	1954328	And then they also have a song creation mode as well.
1955209	1959292	And they're promising all the same stuff that Rock Band is delivering with.
1962853	1963334	and then some.
1983045	1984225	But Konami missed the bus.
1985246	1986067	Years ago.
1986207	1987387	Oh, but it's completely original.
1987427	1987868	You watch.
1988128	1990029	Oh, it's a completely original idea.
1990049	1990890	That's so cool.
1991150	1995913	Tiger Claw sent a list of what songs are supposed to be in Rock Revolution, and some of it sounds interesting.
1995953	1998114	I mean, it has Come On, Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot.
1998135	2002057	Well, the thing about this game is they're focusing on drums.
2002097	2004599	That's basically their focus is on the drums.
2004619	2005059	Okay, wait.
2005139	2007501	Rock Revolution does get some major points right here.
2007561	2009262	We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister.
2009662	2010583	That is pretty awesome.
2010984	2011705	But they're all covers.
2012266	2013247	That's less awesome.
2013728	2016231	Anyways, so songs or games that we have never heard of.
2017332	2021498	Dance Dance Revolution X. Of course, they're celebrating their 10th anniversary.
2021858	2024742	It's going to be all, you know, re-skinned.
2024762	2025303	It kind of...
2026224	2028625	They've got some interesting songs for it so far.
2029745	2032166	But it's going to be 70 different tracks.
2032506	2039428	They're going to have a brand new LAN battle mode that's going to allow you to play up against 8 players over LAN.
2039908	2041648	So, you know, making it competitive.
2042248	2045229	Although I don't know why you would have 8 people having a LAN party for DDR.
2046510	2049870	You can create your own workout and fitness program through the workout mode.
2050391	2052991	They're going to have new characters and enhanced graphics.
2053551	2054892	And it's still going to use the Damai toy.
2057050	2061454	Then they're also going to have DDR Universe 3, which is only on the 360 right now.
2061594	2066058	Also 70 songs with music from the 70s to today.
2066178	2066959	DJ Mode.
2067299	2068640	And all this news surprises no one.
2069461	2070402	It's more DDR.
2071282	2071883	Look, Loki.
2072323	2073124	More DDR.
2073304	2073504	Yeah.
2074745	2075926	They really haven't innovated there.
2076006	2079029	And then Hottest Party 2, which, you know, meh.
2079069	2079249	Yeah.
2079810	2079950	Yeah.
2081319	2082179	More DDR on the Wii.
2082279	2084520	But you can have your Miis now dancing in Hottest Bar 2.
2089021	2090081	But they showed off Silent Hill.
2090361	2091382	Silent Hill's pretty cool.
2092162	2092682	Happy about that?
2095002	2097603	But that's basically it from... Okay, so music games.
2097623	2099084	I want to say, wait, real quick on music games.
2099804	2104905	Okay, I don't have room in my house for all that shit, even if I could afford it.
2105906	2106487	Here's the deal.
2106587	2113231	If these companies want to win this little war on music games, seriously, make a peripheral that works with all the games.
2113951	2115993	Xbox 360 will not have that problem.
2117694	2124498	I'm not sure about the drums, but with the guitars, one of the things Microsoft makes all the companies play nice with each other.
2124938	2127280	So if it's got five buttons, it will work the same way.
2127680	2129162	I didn't buy Rock Band for a reason.
2129182	2129882	Well, I did buy Rock Band.
2129902	2132044	I bought Rock Band as a standalone game with a guitar.
2132425	2135167	I did not buy the whole big box for a reason.
2135528	2136549	This is the reason.
2137690	2138451	This was coming.
2139031	2139632	We all knew it.
2142795	2143395	Here's the thing, though.
2143495	2144216	I don't really care.
2144276	2144556	It's like...
2145809	2157076	I think rock bands kind of hurt themselves a little bit because now that there's all this download content, and I don't know about a lot of people, but I've downloaded a lot of it, I don't really need another game with 40 songs in there.
2157116	2158717	Why do I need to buy another game?
2158777	2161378	Because they're really not going to innovate too much on it.
2161418	2163139	It's just going to have song updates.
2163219	2170964	But when you're getting three new tracks each week that you can download, by the time you get to where another game would be released, you already have another game built in.
2171901	2181669	and the other thing too, which I'm not sure about, you know, Guitar Hero 4 on Tour World or whatever the fuck they're calling it, World Tour.
2183230	2185051	What about all that download content that you had from 3?
2185572	2191877	I know Rock Band 2, one of the things that they were talking about is that you're going to be able to use your old download content from Rock Band 1 with the new game.
2192617	2195258	Kind of like how DDR Ultramix used to do it.
2196319	2198320	Comments from chat, chat.orangelongeradio.com.
2198340	2200281	Gerardimo says, wait, me's in DDR.
2200661	2205203	If you made Loki me in a green suit, would it be like Loki dancing in a tingle suit?
2205583	2205723	No.
2205843	2207384	Probably the closest thing you're going to get to it.
2208144	2213067	Blackwolf is hugging his steel battalion controller, I think making a reference to expensive peripherals.
2214946	2223156	But seriously, you're crazy if you own Steel Battalion You have to be a certain kind of crazy to own Steel Battalion Right, DarkSakura?
2225719	2226600	I have no room to talk
2228229	2232492	But yeah, so it's going to be really hard for these guys to sell.
2234072	2242357	Because also there's rumors going around now with what GameStop has listed on their website for Guitar Hero World Tour, where it's going to cost like $179.
2242837	2247119	So essentially like $10 more than Rock Band.
2247639	2254763	I mean, really, are you guys going to spend close to another $200 to buy... I'm assuming a lot of people out there bought Rock Band and probably...
2255799	2263034	Bottle of the Peripherals for it, but you know, you did that because now you can use your guitar with Guitar Hero and stuff like that, but are you really going to buy more stuff to...
2264226	2265707	do Guitar Hero World Tour.
2266207	2270188	Don't get me wrong, Steel Battalion is a piece of gaming history.
2270528	2274710	I mean, it's the only controller ever that has an eject button and that makes it all kinds of awesome.
2275050	2276590	But you seriously have to be all kinds of crazy.
2276670	2280232	It's just, I don't know, it's going to be really hard with all these games coming out in the holiday.
2280312	2281972	I don't think some of them are going to do well.
2281992	2283953	I'm sure Guitar Hero will do well by itself.
2284173	2289815	Maybe people will just pick up World Tour and maybe do the drums later or something because you can do that or you can
2290376	2298623	I will buy the game, I will not buy the guitar I will not buy the game if it's not compatible with the guitar I already have I am not buying a new guitar until the one I have is run into the ground
2300197	2303239	I don't understand why they redesigned the guitar anyways, each time.
2304140	2305201	All that does is delay the game.
2305221	2309944	So anyway, enough of Konami's Gamer Day stuff.
2309964	2310284	Alright, sorry.
2310304	2311565	Quickly, the rest of last week's news.
2311705	2313906	Anyways, so other stuff.
2314627	2317829	We've got... Sony had their sort of Gamer Day.
2318609	2319910	So there's some stuff coming out of that.
2319930	2321611	I remember they've got...
2323172	2331018	They were showing off some of their new games, like Killzone 2 and Resistance Fallen Man 2 and that kind of stuff.
2331038	2332700	Resistance is supposed to be coming out this fall.
2333641	2338484	Killzone 2 has been delayed to February because they don't want to compete with themselves, which makes sense.
2339065	2343709	And then Motorstorm is going to be coming out, of course, also in the fall as well.
2344898	2355567	LittleBigPlanet, October, and there was a new SOCOM game, Confrontation, I believe, that's coming out to their PlayStation Network in September.
2356968	2360051	Also, Sega was showing off their stuff as well.
2360471	2366556	They announced a partnership with Platinum Games, and they're going to be putting out three games in the beginning of this.
2368278	2370460	One of the games, pretty awesome.
2370480	2372802	Did they announce Plastic Maracas for Samba?
2373462	2374103	No, don't care.
2375003	2376424	Well, that's not Platinum Games, okay?
2377165	2377925	But they're working on it.
2377985	2380967	They want to make those, okay?
2381968	2388472	So right now, the one game, Mad World, which is going to be an ultra-violent game for the Wii.
2388492	2390234	It's all black and white except for the blood.
2390554	2391254	All right, I'm interested.
2392475	2393316	Extremely awesome.
2393336	2396818	They had a trailer where they're killing people in all sorts of fun ways.
2398839	2402402	There's another game that's going to be coming out as well.
2404269	2405230	NudeMaker
2423615	2424636	Quentin Tarantino
2450516	2451257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2475529	2478912	I don't know, you're just not on the cutting edge of game development there.
2479052	2481793	This is why we have a podcast on the internet and not a gaming company.
2481813	2483494	And I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
2483655	2490379	Reading comments from chat real quick, DJ Morpheus says, then I'll get the Rock Band Rehab expansion that comes when you create your own true Hollywood story.
2490699	2492901	That would be fun, like Guitar Hero mixed with Heroin Hero.
2493621	2494081	Good times.
2495703	2495983	Let's see.
2496023	2499106	Gerardimo says that there might be maraca sleeves for somebody.
2499146	2500627	Yeah, that's one thing they're talking about.
2500927	2502568	If not, there's always third-party companies.
2502709	2504610	Someone will make it if the demand's there.
2507499	2511441	One thing, Microsoft did their little Gamer Day thing as well.
2511842	2514223	They showed off the new Banjo-Kazooie game.
2515303	2517665	No motion controllers, unfortunately.
2518165	2521367	No word on what that lips peripheral was or anything like that.
2521447	2523728	I guess we're just going to have to wait.
2524128	2526769	And they showed off Gears of War 2, of course.
2526810	2527590	A little bit more of that.
2527630	2528610	It looks pretty awesome.
2530131	2532453	And that, of course, will be coming out this fall.
2533353	2534813	I'm trying to think if there's anything else cool.
2534833	2540415	There's some other stuff we'll be getting into later on about Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.
2540855	2547837	And I also know that the XNA service has been launched but just for the developers.
2548137	2552118	So people that have a membership to XNA can play the games.
2553979	2557787	Alright, so it sounds like, because wasn't the community supposed to vote on the games and stuff?
2557987	2563378	They're probably getting it ready for letting it run a few cycles so that they have some games to go live when they go live.
2563739	2563899	Yeah.
2564039	2564280	Alright.
2565720	2566781	Enough of last week's news.
2566841	2568503	We're almost 45 minutes into the show.
2568543	2570265	It's time to get into this week's news.
2571006	2577052	And speaking of Guitar Hero, we're going to start off with another Guitar Hero story because I swear these music games have been all over the news lately.
2577312	2577733	It's crazy.
2578954	2582718	On the PlayStation 3 only, Guitar Hero is going to be getting a free song.
2583319	2588304	It makes sense because the Xbox 360 got a free Halo song, so why not a free...
2588744	2590966	God of War song for PlayStation 3 owners.
2590986	2593368	And that's exactly what they're going to be getting on June 5th.
2594008	2596010	Except we don't know which song it is.
2596410	2599132	Just knows that it's a God of War song.
2599653	2603336	And it probably has a lot of heavy guitar, seeing as it's going to be in Guitar Hero.
2603616	2604116	So it'll be free.
2604156	2612443	So it's kind of like Sony's answer to, or I guess you could say, you know, the equivalent of the Halo theme on the Xbox 360 Guitar Hero.
2613263	2613804	So check it out.
2614624	2615065	Do we have to?
2615605	2616126	No, you don't have to.
2616146	2617747	I mean, if you don't own a PS3, you kind of can't.
2618359	2618922	I'll check it out.
2618982	2619424	Then I won't.
2620328	2622819	I like free but then again Yaris was also free.
2623561	2624021	That's true.
2624121	2626223	But I don't see how you can go wrong with a free song.
2626463	2631307	Free songs are only going to... If a free song sucks, it's only going to terrorize you for three minutes and then it's over.
2631327	2634229	Unless it's yodeling with, you know, Zither as the accompany.
2634590	2635350	Yodel Hero.
2635410	2635971	Where's that?
2636591	2637232	That's what I want.
2639053	2641615	How about something that has absolutely nothing to do with music games?
2641635	2642596	Yodelay, yodelay, yodelay.
2642956	2643497	Wind it up.
2643877	2644918	Nothing to do with music games.
2644938	2645738	All right, nothing to do with music games.
2645758	2648441	Except for one of these theme songs was used in pop-up music.
2648681	2648961	Okay.
2649842	2649922	Um...
2652271	2656736	Actually, two of my favorite companies ever are getting together to make a fighting game.
2658038	2662603	I am very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, times infinity happy about this.
2664326	2666168	We are getting Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
2666528	2666929	Yay!
2667750	2668270	So happy.
2668571	2671034	And for those that have no effing idea what Tatsunoko is...
2671798	2686260	It is the animation studio that gave us such a wonderful series as, of course, my favorite of all time, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman gave us Kashan, which are actually Ken and...
2687762	2690104	Tetsuya are both confirmed characters for that.
2690124	2694288	They're on the test versions now along with Ryu and Chun-Li.
2694629	2698352	But they're also for... Other things that they gave us was Hurricane Polymer.
2698773	2700935	Did a lot of the animation for Evangelion.
2700955	2709443	It gave us... I don't know if anyone watched a lot of Nickelodeon in the mid to late 80s, but they gave us the little bits.
2710984	2711124	And...
2713555	2716478	Well, they actually have the Gatchaman music in it.
2716538	2718740	Anyway, sorry, that too.
2727413	2734798	but also, and I apologize, I had to use a different source than what you gave me, Rob, because I... That's all right.
2736340	2750410	What was also sort of hinted at as far as being included in the game is characters from Time Bokan, Hurricane Polymer, Tekkaman, Hakushon Daimo, the Genie family.
2751753	2754935	So, and anyone else who doesn't know, Go!
2754955	2755095	Go!
2755115	2755335	Go!
2755395	2758517	was Tatsunoko as well, which was Speed Racer for us.
2758617	2759517	Was it Macross also?
2759717	2760898	Macross was as well, yes.
2761678	2763159	Okay, honest question though.
2764600	2766921	Is this game really going to come out in America?
2767662	2768382	God, I hope so.
2769102	2773245	And if not, I'll drive my ass down to Arcade Infinity and play the hell out of it.
2774245	2775006	Oh, it's an arcade.
2775546	2776767	Yeah.
2776787	2779288	Oh, are they putting it out on home platforms at all, they said?
2780354	2781315	I haven't seen any mention on it.
2781335	2783897	Hopefully PlayStation 3 because then you can import that bitch.
2784198	2785139	That's a good point.
2785599	2791864	However, if anyone wants to see, there are some, okay, don't look for the Famitsu scans, they're crap.
2792205	2796068	Go actually onto Famitsu's website and look up the images.
2796208	2802354	I mean, if you do a search for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, you'll find a link to Famitsu's page.
2803094	2803395	Tron Bon
2827298	2827998	That would be cool.
2828158	2830520	Ranma is pretty convinced it's not coming out here.
2830580	2835302	He says in chat, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom will not happen in the US due to massive licensing issues.
2835922	2837683	Doesn't mean they won't import it over here.
2838003	2840665	Never say never, but it'll be import heaven.
2841165	2842846	Why do you think I said Arcade Infinity?
2843846	2844947	Because they love Capcom.
2844987	2845747	Are they still around?
2845847	2846888	I'm sure they are.
2846928	2847608	I'm sure they are too.
2847788	2852531	But keep in mind, what arcade's been getting the big imports for ages?
2853231	2853871	True.
2854332	2856252	They even had that weirdo Gundam game.
2856312	2856933	I mean, hello.
2857033	2858053	They had Um Jammer Lamy.
2858333	2863435	I remember playing the Um Jammer Lamy game and I had to... Now, don't get the dirty thoughts out of your mind.
2863475	2864696	I had to play the game on my knees.
2864716	2866437	Because it's made for little kids.
2866497	2869118	So I had to get on my knees to play Um Jammer Lamy, the arcade game.
2869138	2871899	But the best game that was there was the pancake flipping game.
2874910	2875891	No, no, no.
2876031	2876652	Punch Mania.
2876672	2879334	The tambourine game was my favorite thing ever.
2879575	2882958	That was the gayest game I've ever played in my life.
2883158	2887482	It was Samba de Amigo with tambourines and you actually had to shake the tambourine and make these little motions.
2887762	2889444	It was the gayest thing I've ever done in my life.
2892707	2893447	Are you sure?
2893628	2894328	You gay!
2894348	2900154	If you play a tambourine game, you gay.
2902514	2906095	I've marched in the San Francisco Pride Parade and the tambourine game was gayer.
2907976	2913359	I marched behind assless chaps across America and the tambourine was gayer.
2915660	2916160	Moving on.
2916880	2918121	The tambourine was gayer.
2920922	2927626	Microsoft made an announcement and this kind of ruins all those rumors that we had earlier about
2929347	2932348	motion sensing calibration coming to a spring update.
2932568	2934588	Well, there is no spring dashboard update this year.
2935769	2936729	So, so sad.
2936869	2943971	No update, but there may be some other stuff coming later on that's not involved with a dashboard update.
2944571	2946312	Oh well.
2946552	2947872	If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I guess.
2950151	2951632	If it ain't broke, break it more.
2980499	2982121	Before I forget, sorry to interrupt.
2982201	2989987	I'm linking the Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Fumitsu page in the chat room.
2990287	2992509	I was so three minutes ago.
2992770	2993891	Sorry, I had to find it.
2994751	2995792	I do that all the time.
2996613	2998094	I wouldn't shut up about the miss the bus.
2998174	2999215	I didn't miss the bus.
2999335	3000616	I drive a fucking tank.
3002358	3003799	I blew up the bus.
3007502	3008343	Speaking of bus...
3009793	3011214	I made a new friend last night.
3011234	3013476	He's actually somebody who's listened to our show before.
3013516	3015257	He's a friend of a mutual friend.
3015357	3018160	And we were talking about games we'd like to see on the Wii.
3018660	3020141	We were talking about the Wii Wheel.
3020742	3023204	And he said, I know what the Wii Wheel would be useful for.
3023884	3026186	Desert Bus on Virtual Console.
3026366	3027067	You go to hell.
3027987	3028628	You go to hell.
3029829	3032411	And I was like, that would make that Wii Wheel kind of useful.
3033532	3037755	Yeah, for, you know, an 18-hour drive in real time.
3039224	3039544	That is hotness.
3039564	3040024	Behold hotness.
3040044	3040344	Behold corn.
3040364	3040424	Ooh.
3066963	3068424	Remember RBI Baseball?
3082529	3083550	Poor Atari.
3083670	3090975	Apparently the ESRB is listed RBI Baseball, but the developers is Six Degree Games.
3091195	3094637	So I don't know if it's going to be the same RBI Baseball.
3094697	3095418	Probably not.
3095558	3095978	It better be.
3095998	3097800	That would be kind of rad if it was.
3098520	3101202	I don't play a lot of sports games, but I remember RBI Baseball.
3102243	3105585	They really should change their name to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.
3107774	3108434	Oh, God.
3109134	3114396	So regardless, the ESRB listed it, so you know it's coming soon, RBI Baseball, to Xbox Live Arcade.
3115797	3118418	Well, we have some other news regarding Xbox Live Arcade.
3118878	3120218	Anything that's crap goes.
3121839	3133382	Microsoft is going to be delisting older Xbox Live Arcade titles that sold small numbers and have a low Metacritic average.
3133663	3134723	Yaris, please be Yaris.
3136634	3138294	It was free, so a ton of people downloaded it.
3138414	3141775	It's attach rates, so it's people that bought the full version.
3142255	3145056	And unfortunately, since it was a free download, that counts as the full version.
3145477	3145717	Fuck.
3145857	3156701	There's a quote by Mark Whitten, who's Xbox Live's general manager, saying we will be delisting older, underperforming titles in order to keep the service focused on a section of high-quality games.
3157441	3160402	To translate, that means, they're shit, get them off the server.
3161021	3166407	No, to translate that means our marketplace is insufficient to handle this many games.
3166467	3168329	So we have to find a way to reduce it.
3168609	3170791	Because I think that's seriously what it is.
3171652	3178460	There's too many games in the marketplace because Xbox doesn't present it in a very user-friendly way.
3180185	3198435	The rest of the quote goes on to say the way this will work is that the title will need to be at least six months old and have a Metacritic score below 65 and a conversion rate below 6% on the service, which means fewer than 6% of the people will have downloaded the demo and actually pay for it.
3199375	3202277	They say they're also giving a three-month notice before delisting anything.
3203715	3207096	That's kind of interesting, though, that the critics will have kind of a say.
3207296	3208937	That's kind of scary, in a way.
3209017	3212678	I mean, I realize it's got to meet both criteria, but that's still kind of strange to me.
3213719	3214039	I don't know.
3214759	3215099	Let's see.
3215399	3219421	Here's some games that per Metacritic would be eligible for delisting.
3219461	3221601	Now, granted, we don't know how well it sold through.
3222162	3223342	Discs of Tron has a 44.
3223582	3225523	I have to go download that now.
3227190	3228092	I gotta tell you what, though.
3228213	3231903	It really isn't... It was better in your childhood, Jamie.
3232084	3232525	It really was.
3232565	3233588	Is it at least six months old?
3234430	3234952	It's getting there.
3235886	3236786	It's definitely getting there.
3238287	3238687	Let's see.
3238807	3241207	What else is under 65 here?
3241867	3242287	Metacritic.
3242327	3244508	Mr. Driller Online is a 48 right now.
3245068	3247528	So Mr. Driller Online would be eligible for the plug pulling.
3248749	3249309	Let's see.
3249709	3252809	Rocky and Bullwinkle, 37 on Metacritic.
3253230	3254630	But that game was shit.
3255250	3256210	That game was pretty shit.
3257890	3260491	Tikal, Tikal, Tikwal, 58.
3262011	3264272	Quick, can you name what that game is?
3264852	3265372	It's a puzzle game.
3266232	3267333	What's Yaris ranked?
3267373	3268494	Bye bye, Yaris!
3268514	3270176	Euthanize it.
3284269	3296593	Now here's the thing, TigerClaw also said the other exact thing I was thinking before is that this, Sky, this is also bad because people that bought those games won't be able to re-download them if they ever delete them from the hard drive.
3296893	3303395	But BlackWolf says that question was asked directly and they said yes, you can still re-download them using the account management interface.
3304435	3312641	and BlackWolf says they just won't have shelf space anymore, which is kind of a good comparison to make, is that it's like pulling these games off of shelves and putting them in the bargain bin.
3312661	3313242	They're not selling.
3313522	3315684	I think these games should go in the bargain bin, honestly.
3316304	3317605	Yaris was already free.
3318186	3320147	So they have to pay people to download Yaris.
3320407	3321068	Which they should be.
3322536	3324758	There's no amount of money worth downloading yours.
3325779	3327440	So it's going to be interesting.
3327721	3328802	I'm kind of curious to see the effect.
3329102	3336008	I mean, I agree to some extent they need to clean up Xbox Live, but I don't know if I agree with getting rid of games completely.
3336368	3339251	Sweeping them under the rug and making them harder to find?
3339511	3339811	Sure.
3340552	3347337	Spotlighting the games that need to have the spotlight on them because these other crappy retro ports are outdoing them?
3348174	3352218	You know, Rob, if they're going to clean up Xbox Live, they should probably start with the users.
3354560	3357023	Well, they have been doing that to some extent recently.
3357083	3359245	We'll get to more on that a little later.
3360466	3361828	But for now, let's get back to some more gaming news.
3363491	3368354	So Xbox, one of the things, and this kind of goes back to people having to re-download games and stuff.
3369355	3380044	If you've ever had your Xbox 360 crap out on you and you got a replacement, you may find that some of your games don't work anymore unless you're logged in online.
3380124	3390893	Well now, Microsoft is going to release a tool tied in with Xbox.com that will allow you to fix the digital rights management so that your games are locked to your new console.
3391533	3392134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3417034	3430701	Now granted, I got Red Ring of Death three days after I bought my Xbox 360, so I only have two games that do this, but Geometry Wars and Joust were the first two games I bought on Xbox Live Arcade, and whenever I try to play them, if I'm not connected to Xbox Live, they won't work.
3431082	3432663	So in Geometry Wars, that's a pretty big deal.
3432863	3435244	I even notice a little bit of lag.
3435564	3442068	When I go into the game, it's talking to Xbox Live and then realizes I have the retail version, and then suddenly my menu changes to the retail menu.
3442468	3443568	It all happens within seconds.
3443869	3446370	So it'll be kind of nice to take those games back.
3446710	3451294	I know other people have had way worse scenarios where it was more than two games and multiple users in the house.
3451314	3453316	My console has way more than two games.
3455598	3458781	So that'll be kind of nice to reset the digital rights management.
3459401	3461463	We'll see how that works when that comes out.
3462524	3466047	I will definitely be running it to take back control of those two games.
3466107	3466528	We'll see.
3467408	3467569	Um...
3468370	3472051	Well, you're talking a little bit about rediscovering things that were a little bit old.
3472091	3476313	And if you've never played Gears of War, it's probably time to come out from under your rock.
3476573	3485236	And now's a good time, though, because what's going to be happening is that Gears of War is coming out with a brand new re-release, a game of the year edition, if you will.
3485577	3486657	It's coming out this summer.
3487037	3493800	It's Gears of War with all the download content included that originally people had to pay for, and it's only going to be $40.
3495220	3497061	So that's kind of cool.
3499013	3500874	I won't be impressed because that's a Windows version.
3501634	3504314	So June 24th is apparently the day this is coming out.
3504374	3505475	Hey, just in time for my birthday.
3505855	3507695	And the sixth birthday of Orange Lounge Radio as well.
3508236	3509056	On the 23rd of June.
3509156	3509816	That's hardcore.
3510116	3510276	Yes.
3510836	3513357	So if you haven't played Gears of War, you can check that out.
3513817	3518098	But I think, honestly, most people that would enjoy Gears of War have probably already played it.
3518158	3519879	So this does seem a little bit late.
3520359	3524140	But there's a lot of people that are just now getting Xbox 360s too, you know.
3525120	3534007	As the price comes down and more people get HDTVs and want to spend their stimulus checks and yada yada yada, there'll be an audience for this.
3534027	3535829	It won't be a huge audience, but there'll be an audience for this.
3537851	3563924	One thing, though, that I think is going to work out better for everybody who has an Xbox, and it's about damn time, and I think that we all saw it happening, is that Xbox Live Arcade is going to be changing their limit from 150 megabytes to 350 megabytes, and it's been made official, especially since we've got Soul Calibur coming out.
3564619	3568364	They're really trying to get me to upgrade to that 100GB hard drive already.
3568384	3571908	Because I only have a 20GB drive still that I've just been making work.
3572369	3575013	I had to finally uninstall Final Fantasy XI to get the room.
3575193	3580600	Well, the price limit of Xbox Live Arcade games has actually also been raised to 1600 points, which is about 20 bucks.
3583254	3585537	Developers, you better make darn sure your game's worth it.
3585797	3588580	I mean, the Penny Arcade game, they'll get it for that.
3588680	3590542	And it's, you know, it's pretty cool.
3591083	3596690	Again, I haven't had a chance to give it a full review yet, so I can't say for sure if it's worth the 20 bucks, but it seems like it will be.
3597431	3597891	We shall see.
3598352	3598572	Mm-hmm.
3599989	3604192	Interesting, though, that they're... Why do they even have the limits in the first place?
3604232	3611136	I guess they don't want people to go crazy, but I think, you know, when you... Well, yeah, the original Xbox games are, like, one or two gigs.
3611176	3617580	Well, originally they wanted to make sure that people that did not buy hard drives were able to put at least one game on their memory unit.
3617600	3620682	Well, you know... Well, now their memory units are 512, so now they can do 350.
3620862	3622704	I don't know, it's stupid, but yeah.
3622724	3623244	Or they could just do 512.
3624265	3627247	Or, I don't know, buy a hard drive like everybody fucking else, okay?
3627287	3627667	Seriously.
3627707	3628247	Exactly.
3628828	3628948	Um...
3630026	3631866	So, this is not a big surprise.
3631886	3633807	I mean, the game that did so well.
3634687	3640788	Eventually, of course, it would be coming to the PlayStation 3, but Bioshock is officially coming to the PS3.
3640808	3647010	It has been rumored to be coming for a while now, and it will be due out this holiday.
3647590	3655991	And apparently, the port they claim is going to have slightly better graphics, some additional game content.
3657312	3658832	We'll have to see, I guess, when it comes out.
3661770	3662671	S.T.A.R.S.
3689453	3691195	Well, this week there's not a whole lot coming out.
3691736	3698944	Pretty much the big title is going to be Enemy Territory Quake Wars on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3699985	3702207	Also on the Wii this week, we've got Death Jr.
3704338	3704658	I don't know.
3704678	3707219	I don't know if I get too excited about DeathJunior game.
3707299	3709000	But yes, brand new DeathJunior.
3709100	3710360	Well, actually, I wouldn't say it's brand new.
3710400	3712901	It's a remake coming to the Wii.
3713241	3721084	There's also Emergency Heroes, which is just like Emergency Mayhem, both sort of like Crazy Taxi.
3722105	3724205	And I don't know.
3724305	3725806	That's going to be coming out to the Wii.
3726486	3733089	And then this week is, I believe, Super Dodgeball Brawlers, which was a...
3734898	3735619	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3756716	3757858	Metallic Rose DS Lite
3775470	3784758	Also... I saw a commercial on TV for the Metallic... I don't... Well, I think she was playing a Metallic Rose or a Pink DS, but it had Carrie Underwood playing Nintendogs on the DS.
3784898	3786379	I don't even remember what show I was watching that.
3786399	3787901	Did her dogs run away from her because that'd be funny?
3788101	3788681	No, they didn't.
3788701	3791824	She was giving them a bath and giggling, although I bet it wasn't even her playing the game.
3792164	3794126	They just had her posing with a, you know, empty DS.
3794726	3794807	Um...
3795447	3795988	and DarkSakura.com.
3818531	3822812	Also on the PC, Mass Effect is finally coming out, so you can play that as well.
3824053	3827314	Dracula Origin on PC.
3827494	3835076	If you want to shop at GameStop, there's the USA Today Crosswords Challenge, which is a GameStop exclusive.
3835816	3836396	Woo-wee!
3836456	3838257	That's one hell of an exclusive.
3838937	3841878	That's put out by Destineer, who makes only good games, I'm sure.
3842318	3843038	Oh, wait, no, they don't.
3844559	3845399	And then...
3847170	3848271	And then that's pretty much it.
3848331	3849852	Oh, World Championship Cards.
3850452	3851053	That's right.
3851173	3855035	It's card games that aren't poker or blackjack.
3856896	3857777	Like Solitaire.
3859098	3859518	Awesome.
3860238	3864661	Oh, and there's a game called Bus Driver for the PC by Got Game Entertainment.
3867478	3870241	As long as Bus Driver has an awesome theme song, that would be cool.
3871382	3872924	I think we all know the theme song already.
3873144	3875306	Ranma's accusing me of watching Lifetime again.
3875386	3878810	No, there haven't been any Lifetime movies recently that I've been interested in watching.
3879451	3882634	Although I think there's a new one coming out that has, well, forget it.
3884698	3886039	Lifetime because men are evil.
3910583	3912945	And it makes me so embarrassed to be a man.
3913185	3914486	The DarkSakura story.
3916308	3916648	Rob.
3917048	3917388	What?
3918489	3919770	I have no secret shame.
3921952	3925594	My shame is very public because I go to it once a week.
3927596	3930718	This certain little garage studio.
3931599	3932960	Very, very public shame.
3933901	3934141	Rob.
3934681	3934901	What?
3935242	3935562	What?
3939349	3942430	They totally should make a Lifetime Movie of the Week about Jamie's life.
3942730	3943791	Who would play Jamie?
3944151	3945411	That's the question of the day.
3946712	3948232	We need an Instapoll in chat.
3948332	3950733	Who would play Jamie in her Lifetime Movie of the Week?
3951574	3953514	Someone who's sufficiently bitchy.
3954175	3957636	So I'd say Ella Izadushku because I don't want to, you know, look like myself.
3958004	3958824	Well, I don't know.
3958844	3960025	Christina Ricci.
3960225	3964086	She's not really a celebrity, but she's a TV celebrity, I guess.
3964286	3968288	But that one chick, Mary Alice from Ace of Cakes.
3968528	3969068	That would work.
3969488	3970388	I don't watch TV.
3970449	3972509	Janine Garofalo about 10 years ago.
3973490	3974050	I like her.
3974170	3976091	I would approve of her.
3976891	3977951	She's sufficiently bitchy.
3979412	3981693	Jamie Summers as herself, says Actdeft.
3982033	3984033	Margaret Cho, says Dark Tensuya.
3984213	3985394	Hi, I'm not Korean.
3987262	3988463	I look nothing like Margaret Cho.
3988944	3990886	Margaret Cho is gorgeous, but no.
3990946	3992387	Ranma says my best friend, Patty.
3994689	3996171	Tina Fey as Jamie.
3996291	3997472	Oh, that's a good one.
3997933	3999955	Tina Fey is the gal with, she was in Mean Girls.
3999995	4001716	She was the teacher with the glasses and everything.
4001736	4002457	I have to look this up now.
4002477	4002937	Look her up.
4003698	4004539	I like, that's a good one.
4004559	4005480	That's my favorite so far.
4006521	4007342	Ew, Rachel Ray.
4009020	4009922	That's wrong.
4010082	4010763	Instant ban.
4011023	4011584	No, I'm just kidding.
4011964	4013727	Oh, I know who this is.
4014347	4016891	I have a friend who has a picture of her with genius on it.
4016931	4017752	Tina Fey is cute.
4017892	4018273	I like her.
4019807	4020047	All right.
4020407	4023889	Anyhow, release dates over in Japan.
4024489	4033194	Coming on the Xbox 360, Battle Fantasia comes out as well as Lost Planet Colonies and Overlord all coming out on May the 29th in Japan.
4033554	4036756	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, another port of Battle Fantasia.
4036776	4038957	I'm not exactly sure what Battle Fantasia is.
4038977	4041218	Battle Fantasia just sounds awesome.
4041378	4042599	It's like a fighting game.
4043119	4043479	Is it really?
4043499	4044340	But it's pretty cool looking.
4045300	4046402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4061266	4062427	No, it's by Arc System Works.
4063288	4063868	Go figure.
4064489	4066470	Be familiar with the... Oh, they did Guilty Gear.
4066490	4068332	Guilty Gear and Fist of the North Star.
4068912	4069793	Alright, so there you have it.
4069813	4073155	So that game's coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4074156	4079040	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard 4 Wii Edition.
4079100	4080501	You might know that as Resident Evil.
4080541	4081762	They call it Biohazard overseas.
4082442	4085144	Family Trainer Athletic World with Matt.
4085245	4088067	Please note that is not Wii Fit, but a cheap knockoff.
4088927	4090368	On the PlayStation 2, hey...
4091149	4092770	Remember Beatmania 2DX?
4093470	4094170	Remember that game?
4094210	4094670	Uh, what?
4095050	4095690	Remember that game?
4096171	4102533	The 14th edition Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold finally hits the PlayStation 2 on May the 29th.
4103893	4104593	I should get that.
4104973	4107034	I kind of want it too, just for old time's sake.
4107234	4109635	I actually want Happy Sky just because it says Happy Sky.
4110277	4111639	Burnout Revenge Death Jam Vendetta
4126434	4128497	because Japan needed their Def Jam Vendetta.
4129078	4133665	Fatal Fury Battle Archives is coming out on the PlayStation 2 on May 29th.
4134006	4137130	Fushugi Yugi gets some new games coming out.
4137190	4138312	That series, yeah.
4138653	4140355	Suzaku Ibun.
4140395	4141998	No, she's still writing books.
4143131	4167798	uh Medal of Honor lots and lots of stuff coming out on the uh by the way there is a Konami style special edition for a Beatmania 2DX 14 gold it probably comes with stickers and a bunch of useless crap uh Beatmania 14 gold poster oh Beat Nation LEDs album and puzzle pieces and Beatmania 2DX premium live DVD the Beat Nation Summit that'd be cool that'd be kind of cool
4169369	4169669	I don't know.
4169689	4172411	I don't have the love for B-mania that I used to have.
4172872	4176615	I think I got really disappointed that they gave up on it in the U.S.
4177235	4179137	I was really disappointed they gave up on it here.
4179457	4180237	They could have done a lot better.
4180257	4181999	Well, their biggest advocate left the company.
4182579	4183380	I guess that's true, too.
4184741	4192347	On the Nintendo DS, 13 Sai no Hello Work DS, Front Mission 2089, Border of Madness, another Sudoku game.
4192367	4193087	Front Mission's awesome.
4194128	4198912	Zombie Shiki, Yogo Ryoku Soshi Jutsu, English of the Dead.
4200114	4203096	Oh, good times.
4203376	4205138	That sounds like an interesting list.
4205198	4206539	I know, it sounds like another game I'm thinking of.
4207639	4216105	On the Sony PSP, I always thought this was a pretty bitchin' band that Enya used to be in, but Clannad, it comes out on the Sony PSP.
4216866	4217746	It was Enya's sister.
4218207	4219027	Was it Enya's sister?
4219247	4220849	Yeah.
4220909	4222009	Clannad, let's see.
4223050	4223771	What is this about?
4224271	4226913	Oh, God, it's from this company that makes dating sim games.
4228424	4257554	Clonod has gone from Enya's sister to Dating Sims Memories Off and Valhalla Nights 2 all those are your Japanese release dates after a pretty slow month in Japan that's good that you guys are getting a lot of stuff this week so congrats Japan is a winner this week well honestly I'd have to say that for the UK releases the winning week had to have been last week so I do want to go ahead and mention a few things that are already out that people should be getting or should have
4259059	4283944	and if they don't have Silent Hill Origins already I'm going to cry but Dr. Mario and Germ Busters out on Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, My Life as a King, Lost Ones, Star Soldier R those are all really good and the Penny Arcade game too is actually on the 21st now what we have coming out for this next release period oh and by the way they got Rock Band like all the good stuff is already out so I don't see what the point is
4284335	4290677	Death Junior, Root of Evil, Dream Pinball, Enemy Territory Quake Wars, Monster Madness Gravedigger, Pool Party, Race Driver Grind, Supreme Commander, Codename Panzers Cold War, and Jamster All-Stars.
4311775	4312255	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4337634	4338074	Nothing yet.
4338114	4338454	That's it.
4338695	4338955	Alright.
4339495	4342336	Let's get back into some gaming news.
4342416	4347058	Metal Gear Solid 4, I made a joke earlier about the long cutscenes, but it's really not a joke.
4347499	4351961	Some of the cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4 are apparently up to 90 minutes long.
4353161	4354542	The good news is you can pause them.
4355687	4357008	And that might be an exaggeration.
4357028	4363831	Yeah, also the news came out this week that that might be a slight exaggeration that it's not really 90-minute cutscenes.
4364251	4369253	But I would bet it's probably like Lost – because Lost Odyssey had some fucking long cutscenes in it.
4369573	4373675	But they were broken up like a little bit, like little bits here and there it was broken up.
4373715	4378437	So it's probably the same type of deal Metal Gear Solid 4 where you play for a little bit.
4378857	4379057	Yeah.
4380543	4387408	Well, some other Metal Gear Solid 4 news is that Kojima is going to be in London signing sleeves.
4388089	4405403	So, the release date is actually the 12th of June, and he is going to be around signing, let me see if it's going to be where he is, at HMV's Oxford Street London store on the 2nd of June to sign the copies, so...
4407418	4412021	It's also not just Kojima, but Yoji Shinkawa is going to be there too.
4413061	4420105	And there's 300 sleeves available from the store on the day of the event, and it starts at 9 o'clock a.m.
4420245	4429570	So I will personally give whatever listener who gets me one a shout-out and my undying affection.
4431411	4435253	And I'll send you clippings from the ferret.
4437372	4438772	Just so you know, they are just like sleeves.
4438872	4442193	It's not actually the game that he's signing since, you know.
4442694	4443554	That's why I said sleeves.
4443934	4445434	Wait, you're going to shave the ferret?
4446295	4447275	I said clippings.
4448235	4449456	Like maybe part of its butt hair.
4450816	4451716	Shave the ferret.
4452136	4454017	That sounds like a mini game in WarioWare.
4454717	4455177	Shave!
4455878	4457118	That sounds dirty, Rob.
4459692	4484464	you're gonna shave the ferret earlier Jamie and I were talking about OLR the RPG and you know how like Final Fantasy has like the Tetra Master card games instead of the card game you could have shave the ferret the minigame inside of the OLR or that could be like the first quest because you know the first quest is always something pointless to introduce you to the game's mechanics I think the first quest should be like having to take the ferret out for a shave
4486831	4496055	I was actually wanting to make a contest about whoever wanted to take RPG Maker or something and actually make an OLR RPG, like a full-fledged RPG.
4497536	4497956	I'd be right.
4497976	4499137	That would take a long time.
4499637	4500157	Exactly.
4500177	4501178	It would take a long time.
4501658	4507781	Well, personally, I was going to talk about... Well, they should have... You know that game coming out, Blastworks?
4508121	4509682	The entire game is totally customizable.
4509722	4511743	We can make our own levels and stuff like that.
4511943	4514965	Plus, they have a website that you can upload it all to and you can download it, so...
4515664	4520909	There's a little bit more, though, about getting the sleeves.
4521029	4522330	They're not just giving them out.
4522930	4529596	You will get a sleeve if you pre-order the game at HMV, and the deposits for the game is five pounds.
4532058	4533079	Five pounds?
4533459	4533900	Five quid.
4534200	4534440	All right.
4534861	4536482	Good lord, that's a lot of pounds.
4560858	4571508	an NFL in just one play, UMD, a voucher to download the game Beats off the PlayStation Store, and a 1GB memory stick.
4572348	4574190	And the knowledge you play too many sports games.
4575191	4580156	I think it's kind of funny though that they include Beats on there, but hey, more power to them I guess.
4580956	4583419	But that is coming August 12th.
4584279	4585841	Yet another PSP bundle.
4588193	4592697	You know, our old friend of the show, Shane, is going to get this bundle simply because the PSP is blue.
4593778	4594298	It's kind of sad.
4595299	4598662	Is he going to put high school musical stickers all over it?
4598803	4599203	Probably.
4601065	4602366	Resident Evil 5.
4602446	4603487	This game looks hot.
4603647	4605088	I don't know if you've seen the screenshots.
4605389	4606470	This game looks awesome.
4606530	4610714	It's got that whole over-the-shoulder thing from Resident Evil 4, but it's now on next-gen systems.
4611454	4613975	and a hot game even gets hotter.
4614355	4620817	Apparently, Resident Evil 5 is going to be featuring cooperative play mode, and that means you can play co-op throughout the campaign.
4621718	4627860	There's going to be also cover system mechanics in the game, so you can actually lock to a wall and then fire around corners.
4628680	4633202	If you're not actually playing in co-op mode, the other character in the game will be controlled by the AI.
4633642	4634282	That's kind of interesting.
4634302	4637464	There's also going to be dodging that is done by the right analog stick.
4637784	4640386	And apparently the game is in these more open areas.
4640746	4642146	So this game sounds pretty awesome.
4642687	4647149	All this information, by the way, comes from an article that was on GamesRadar but got pulled.
4647989	4649730	And you know what it means when articles get pulled.
4650130	4651751	They were true the whole time.
4652232	4652792	Trust us.
4653112	4653832	People die?
4656194	4656894	No, that too.
4657794	4658735	People don't die.
4658855	4660476	They just get threatened and bullied a lot.
4661456	4662417	Again, trust us.
4662497	4662777	We know.
4664746	4665627	I wouldn't know anything about that.
4665647	4666708	They get taken out in the back alley.
4667990	4668910	Beat up a little bit.
4669191	4671593	Well, there's something else that should make some people happy, too.
4672094	4680382	So if you get threatening letters from Capcom, you can go hide in another series, which is Oddworld.
4681553	4683093	I know that there are fans of this series.
4683333	4687994	I have not played them, but I know a lot of people who love the Oddworld games.
4688714	4689435	Oddworld games.
4690955	4696216	And so the co-founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, said that he's working on another Oddworld game.
4696996	4702077	It will feature new animation... Sorry, I got really mad.
4702117	4703337	I decided to shoot Loki.
4703417	4705098	Oh, okay.
4705118	4705198	Ow!
4707153	4708394	His foot hurts again.
4708694	4711275	I was loading something in advance because I tried to work in advance.
4711295	4711935	Yeah, your gun.
4712255	4713676	Yes, I was loading my gun.
4717157	4718178	Can I finish reading now?
4718198	4718538	Christ.
4718918	4719918	Alright, yes you can.
4719998	4720279	Sorry.
4721966	4723167	I didn't mean for that to happen.
4723667	4724087	Yeah, right.
4724907	4730990	Anyway, they're saying that basically the visuals are going to be about the same as what you'd expect in a good CGI feature film.
4733692	4743877	The quote says, from Braun, the rendering tools are getting so good now for 3D animation that you can literally create a linear animation and create a video game using the exact same objects.
4744457	4745017	That's pretty cool.
4746138	4752302	So, I might have to check this one out myself, but they're basically saying that it could be a few years before the project's complete.
4753642	4759486	They're also saying, though, the hint is that the Oddworld games to be released in the future are going to be episodic.
4761847	4762928	So, that's kind of nifty.
4764789	4765149	Alright.
4765709	4766990	It worked for Sam and Max.
4768251	4772093	Well, speak of episodic... It did not work for Shenmue.
4772657	4774871	Well, speaking of episodic content...
4776983	4780304	Horlore, you may remember them of the World of Warcraft.
4780324	4782664	Apparently they got sued so they had to change their name.
4782744	4789486	But Horlore, the fantasy porn series that's out there now that is based off of World of Warcraft.
4789526	4795427	Now they're branching off into a new online game to parody, I guess, in porn.
4795868	4803089	And that would be the Age of Conan with their brand new series, Horlore Presents, The Rage of Bonan.
4803589	4804450	And it will actually...
4806110	4808032	Feature the first episode.
4808052	4808573	Lots of boning.
4808833	4809814	Well, lots of boning.
4810455	4824368	But yeah, the first episode is apparently going to be a recreation of one of the missions that you go on in the beginning of the game, where you have to rescue some chick who is apparently tied up and then, except in this, they have sex with her, so...
4825330	4840608	Uh, interesting, but I mean, you know, they have some pretty interesting, uh, names for their episodes and stuff, like the first one, I remember Horlor, or, you know, World of Horcraft, the first one, Rogues Do It From Behind, gotta love that, and then, Pirate Booty, actually.
4841072	4848354	Yes, but if you're interested and you're of age, you can download these and purchase them at horlor.com.
4848595	4860178	You know, I was just thinking, it's been a while since we've had a video game porn crossover story because, you know, I was just, don't ask me why, but I was thinking the other day about Final Fuck X and how hilarious that porno was.
4860218	4861459	Have you ever seen Final Fuck X?
4862099	4862720	This is great.
4862780	4863480	Remember Dansan's fuck?
4863500	4865362	It's basically boning some cosplayers.
4865742	4874689	Yes, it's basically Japanese porno, and it's basically these girls are dressed up like Yuna and Riku and Lulu, and they get fucked.
4875930	4877571	I don't think it's the final fuck, though.
4877611	4879072	I think the title's a little deceiving.
4879092	4879633	Yay for Lulu.
4879873	4881414	I have a feeling they get fucked again in the sequel.
4881434	4886478	And in case you haven't ever seen these before, they do have pictures online, and they do have the elf ears, too.
4886618	4887359	So it's like a...
4887939	4889040	You know, fanboys.
4889060	4891302	They're very, very great costumes.
4893003	4893563	No, seriously.
4893884	4895685	It's just very, very smug.
4895765	4896946	It's very, very good cosplay.
4896966	4898467	They just get fucked.
4898627	4905052	In OLR history, I remember one week when we reviewed Dance Dance Fuck live on air because you actually got this porno somehow.
4905432	4910316	I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay and I saw some like, I gotta buy this.
4911236	4911536	Rob.
4911576	4914838	There's actually a porno called Dance Dance Fuck, but they don't actually ever play Dance Dance Revolution.
4914858	4919481	No, it has the font, and then it's like Dance Dance... These para-looking girls.
4919581	4921802	Dance Dance Fuck, like, six max or something.
4921822	4924603	Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck six max or something like that.
4924643	4925484	It was so funny.
4925704	4929406	Until you've seen live-action Smurf porn, you ain't seen shit.
4930359	4930719	All right.
4931200	4937044	But anyways, this company also, just so you know, they do have the first FPS porn as well.
4937124	4943568	They have FPS porn episode one, and it is done in the style of an FPS shooter.
4944148	4945970	One has to wonder what the gun is.
4948311	4948832	Eight bucks.
4949432	4949912	It's not bad.
4951693	4952154	Very nice.
4954804	4956066	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4967139	4969960	Oh, oh, oh, real quick, sorry, and I forgot to add one thing.
4970960	4971820	You're interrupting his bouncing.
4971840	4973100	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
4973720	4983482	In the Age of Conan, they actually have a guild for Horlor as well, and if you want to sign up for their guild for Age of Conan, it's horlorguild.com.
4983742	4985683	So yes, you too can be part of the Horlor.
4986923	4987163	Nice.
4988623	4988943	All right.
4989723	4992344	Anyhow, I said happy music.
4993359	4994019	You're meeting G over there
5025658	5028465	Even the little gaming thing's voice sucks.
5030713	5056193	but Typing of the Dead is a modification of House of the Dead 2 which is a first person rail shooter except in this one phrases and words pop up and you have to type them to kill them I've played an arcade version of this, it's quite difficult since I'm not too familiar with a Japanese keyboard but I have the Dreamcast version of this game
5057094	5058034	I like that, um...
5080225	5085127	When they're walking around, they have Dreamcasts on their back and keyboards in front of them instead of carrying their guns around.
5085287	5086608	Unless you play the PC version.
5086948	5088188	Yes, you can on GameTask.
5088388	5092390	PC versions kind of ask, but... Hey, but it's all I got.
5092710	5093170	Yeah.
5093950	5095531	I can bring over my Dreamcast one day.
5095711	5099433	But anyway, Typing of the Dead was just really fun.
5099973	5101753	And it's so just... Go away!
5103474	5106256	I guess a good, it's just absurd, basically.
5106336	5109538	It's stupid, but it's really fun.
5109658	5113101	And on top of that, it has the worst voice acting ever, which makes it even better.
5113241	5113921	My god.
5114762	5117604	I was like, there was nothing we could do.
5119460	5120481	It's that epic.
5120781	5121802	I don't want to die.
5121922	5125085	I remember playing a game like this once at Arcade Infinity.
5125125	5126447	I don't know if it was still typing in the deck.
5126467	5127948	No, the one they had was typing in the deck.
5128609	5129409	But it was in Japanese?
5129429	5129510	Yeah.
5129790	5130571	Okay.
5130831	5132432	But it was the same game, just in Japanese?
5133153	5138058	Well, the first few levels, if I do recall right, were mostly in English.
5138958	5143763	But it was as you get to boss battles that they were using the... Yo, you could type...
5144884	5152948	because they used English letters, it was just the Japanese words, so you could type it and you could play through the game, but when you got to the boss, there's one boss that asks questions.
5153108	5153468	Yeah, that was it.
5153528	5155249	And that was the part where you always got screwed.
5158851	5159491	So there you have it.
5160532	5168936	I also like that if you look at how House of the Dead has little kids that you can shoot and find, well, they actually pop up as letters.
5170097	5171978	That is cool, I like that.
5173487	5174968	I freaking love Typing of the Dead.
5175029	5177690	I think it's about time this game got some respect.
5178111	5178931	Alright, so there you have it.
5178971	5181373	Typing of the Dead, your classic game of the week.
5181713	5184796	Available on Dreamcast, which is the preferred version for Jamie.
5184916	5185596	Or PC, if you must.
5186297	5187738	Everything is better on Dreamcast.
5187978	5188238	Alright.
5190420	5191160	Very good pick.
5191540	5193962	Again, I'm surprised that that has never been picked before.
5194322	5195703	Well, I haven't been doing this that long.
5195723	5196504	I know, I guess so.
5196884	5197385	But there you go.
5198105	5199786	Basically, you want to know how we came across it?
5199886	5200667	How we decided to?
5200887	5201828	Because we went in the vault.
5203270	5204211	Ah, went in the vault.
5204231	5204971	Tiara's nodding her head.
5204991	5206032	Did you make Tiara go in the vault?
5206652	5207332	Yeah.
5207352	5208633	Tiara's like, I was in the vault.
5208693	5209193	It was dark.
5209234	5209734	It was cold.
5209754	5211135	They tried to lock me in the vault.
5211175	5212215	They locked me in the vault.
5213156	5216918	I grabbed a stack of games and just kept going through them.
5217338	5218339	Yeah, I did, and it was fun.
5218359	5222041	But I kept going through them until I found Typing Dead.
5222461	5222701	All right.
5222721	5224302	There were other games there that I might do later.
5225251	5225711	Thanks for watching!
5245644	5247346	and movies.
5247506	5249567	Lots of game movie crossovers.
5249667	5256393	And yes, the whole Xbox shenanigans around the guy whose name happened to be kind of gay.
5257093	5260456	We'll talk about that all in Part B after a quick break.
5260476	5262617	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
