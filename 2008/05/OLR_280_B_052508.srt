Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,720
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. For this part B of our podcast, it is Sunday, May 25th, 2008.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,120
Happy Memorial Day to those of you guys in the States who are celebrating Memorial Day tomorrow.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Hooray for three-day weekend.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,900
You know, three-day weekends in the OLR world usually mean that we're gonna get drunk for Sunday nights, but not this year.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,240
It's kind of, well, it's kind of a downer. Why not?

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,720
Well, Loki had to drive here and of course, you're not gonna drink and drive. That's not okay.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,400
And Dark Soccer, you know, she's entertaining companies, so she doesn't want to be passed out while company is here.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,940
And me, I'm not, I'm not allowed to drink medically right now because of everything I have with my pancreas.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,900
I might have to stay away from alcohol for a long time. So, but that's okay.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,700
You know, you don't need alcohol. You know, alcohol's fun when done responsibly, but you don't need it.

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,280
So, I'll live. But I do need Olive Garden, so I hope I can eat, you know, something besides vegetables again soon.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,820
We'll see.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,300
Those of you playing the drinking game at home, take a shot.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Why? Why do they, why do they take a shot?

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Olive Garden.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,100
All right.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,940
Anyhow, we're gonna get back into the gaming news here on Part B.

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,660
If you missed Part A, you should go back in the podcast feed and listen to it.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,420
Unless you're listening live on Sunday, then unless you can rewind time,

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,700
you're just gonna have to wait for Part A to hit the podcast feed, which should happen soon.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,300
But in the meantime, We News, Loki.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:47,700
Yes, we didn't get this game over here, but they had a music game in Japan that translated to Band Brothers.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:57,300
And also in Japan, they will be getting a brand new sequel to that game, which is entitled Band Brothers DX.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,700
And it will allow players to stream their best performances to their Wii for output through TV speakers, stereos, and home theater systems.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,100
And to accompany this, the Wii is getting a new channel called the Speaker Channel,

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,100
which will allow you to do such, you know, things as that.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
So, that's pretty interesting.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:30,100
And also, I guess it's, the Band Brothers game, the original one is due out for the US as well, called Jam with the Band.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Or at least it was, but now don't know if that's still coming out.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
What if I don't want to jam with the band?

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Then you don't play this game.

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
What if I want to dance with myself?

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
But thou must.

38
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
I don't know.

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
So, it looks neat, I guess.

40
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
It sounds interesting.

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Do you think it's something we might ever get here in the States?

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Nintendo likes releasing stuff here.

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,100
We didn't get the TV Guide channel, but granted, there's a whole nother reason for that.

45
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Well, something from Japan that we are going to be seeing on the Virtual Console.

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Thank you, ESRB, for spilling the beans on a few new releases that are going to be coming out.

47
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Mega Drive had a game in Japan only.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
It was called Glay Lancer.

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Not gray, that's Glay. G-L-E-Y.

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Glay Lancer came out, and that's supposedly going to be coming out here soon.

51
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:29,100
Konami had a game on the NES called Biomiracle Bakute Upa.

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Both of those games are going to make their way if the ESRB is to be believed, which usually they are pretty reliable.

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Also, just as an FYI, other games that were spotted on the ESRB's website, these aren't imports,

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,100
but pretty cool nonetheless, City Connection for the NES.

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
That was a Jellico game. I don't know if you remember that game.

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
It had the heart.

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Dark Sakura will be happy about this.

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Alex Kidd in Miracle World finally coming out.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
I know it's not Shinobi World, but it's the next best game.

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
I was going to say yay.

61
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Oh, you were?

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Yes.

63
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
I thought you were going to complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
I was going to say yay and then complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.

65
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Alright, sorry, my bad.

66
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
God, Rob.

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Don't put words in my mouth.

68
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,100
What's that game? It's not Rock Paper Scissors. What do they call it in Alex Kidd?

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
John Ken Pon.

70
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
John Ken Pon.

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,100
You can play that to your heart's content in Alex Kidd Miracle World.

72
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
Coming soon.

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
But now more news.

74
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Because no ganous is good ganous.

75
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Wait, wrong show.

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Well, this is a story brought to me by the lovely and talented Tiara,

77
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,100
who is sitting next to me with her thumb in the air.

78
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:46,100
It's product placement done wrong.

79
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,100
There's this huge, massive Wii Fit, you know, humongoid thing.

80
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,100
And it's right over Chevy's in Times Square.

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,100
But isn't it healthy because it's like fresh mix and stuff?

82
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah, it's fresh mix.

83
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,100
You can have a big fucking burrito and a big fucking margarita as big as your head.

84
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
It's exactly what I said earlier.

85
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
And you could be healthy because you'll go home to Wii Fit.

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Yeah, you won't care because you'll go home drunk and fall off the Wii.

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Look, as long as I have a salad and bottomless chips and salsa, I'll be fine, right?

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
No.

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
But it's a salad, Jamie.

90
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
But I have to tell my Chevy story.

91
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
With avocado and sour cream, I'll be fine, right?

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Sour cream.

93
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
You can't have sour cream.

94
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
You're nowhere sponsored by Chevy's.

95
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
I have a Chevy story, though.

96
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,100
All right, real quick, since we are orange lounge foodio.

97
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
I ordered a margarita.

98
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
It was a prickly pear margarita, and I ordered a small one, so you know it was massive.

99
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
And they spilled a third of it.

100
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh, no, so I had to give you another one.

101
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
No.

102
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
What?

103
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,100
They refilled that third with tequila.

104
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,100
And I'm eating my seafood fajitas, which is probably the thing I get every time I go there.

105
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Drinking down this hefty...

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
And you know me and tequila on top of that.

107
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,100
You know, it's like Drew said earlier, waffles.

108
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Waffles, waffles, waffles.

109
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,100
You know the last time I had that much tequila anywhere near you guys, I passed out.

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,100
No, I threw up because everyone lit up in the living room at Tia's house.

111
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,100
And by the time before that, I ate half a box of waffles in your bed.

112
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
What?

113
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Well, A, I just saw Guardian Legend on my TV, so I got distracted for a minute.

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Shiny.

115
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Loki's playing with all these things he shouldn't be on the Wii right now.

116
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Sorry.

117
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
It's very distracting.

118
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
So now, from here on, I'm going to associate Wii Fit with Chevy's and, therefore, margarita.

119
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
So whenever I think of Wii Fit, I'll get drunk.

120
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I'll tell you what, though.

121
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I think the product placement is working.

122
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I mean, maybe not in this particular case, but you can't find Wii Fit anywhere right now.

123
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
I missed launch day.

124
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
I slept through it or whatever.

125
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,100
And I didn't get the game when it came out, and I'll never get it now.

126
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Right, Loki?

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Probably.

128
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,100
It's in short supply right now because those Wii Balance boards are fucking hard to manufacture.

129
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,100
I was in GameStop in Las Vegas a few days ago, one of the most obese cities in the nation,

130
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,100
and there were like 75 Wii Fit boards just sitting there.

131
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
It was like they couldn't get rid of them.

132
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Damn it.

133
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Please take these.

134
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Damn it.

135
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm shopping in the wrong place.

136
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Because people are like, money?

137
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
I have to gamble that away.

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
See, KikoMan2DX in chat says Wii Fit is in Costco.

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
I was just at Costco today, and no it wasn't.

140
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I looked.

141
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,100
I mean, maybe in your neck of the woods, but not mine, sadly.

142
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:31,100
In regards to Wii Fit, just a little reference to the hardcore old school computer nerds out there.

143
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Two words spring to mind.

144
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Guru meditation.

145
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Imagine that on the Wii Fit board.

146
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,100
How about dance aerobics?

147
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
That's old school for you.

148
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
That works too.

149
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Dance aerobics.

150
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Remember that game on the NES for the power pad?

151
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah.

152
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Dance aerobics is hardcore.

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Well, don't they have something like that coming out in Japan from Namco?

154
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
It's got like a little power pad thing.

155
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Dude, they could do it with like real music now too.

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,100
They don't need those crappy little like, well, not that NES music was crappy because it wasn't,

157
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,100
but they could actually have like real songs in it and stuff.

158
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
You know, I could work out to Britney Spears.

159
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
It'd be fun.

160
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Well, it would be fun.

161
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
For a minute.

162
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
For a minute?

163
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Yeah.

164
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,100
This game may not be Wii Fit, and it certainly is not dance aerobics,

165
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,100
but coming to WiiWare soon is a game that is probably just as important,

166
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,100
and that would be the official beer pong game.

167
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
That's right.

168
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Just what I needed.

169
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Coming to the Wii.

170
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,100
In fact, according to the website features cup, ball, and beer in good times.

171
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Two girls, one cup.

172
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Right?

173
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:47,100
And anyways, so yeah, it will be coming to a Wii near you,

174
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,100
and also, I mean, shit, they have Game Party out right now,

175
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,100
which has a game called Ping Cup, which is essentially the same damn thing for 20 bucks,

176
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,100
but you know, if you want to pay $10 or whatever when this comes out,

177
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
you can go ahead and do that as well.

178
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,100
This is the first of a new games division from JV Games, their frat party games.

179
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Frat party games, beer pong.

180
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
I'm sorry, why would you play beer pong without real beer?

181
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I wonder if they're going to have...

182
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Maybe you're not 21.

183
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Then why would you be playing beer pong?

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Frat party games in preparation for being 21.

185
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
That'd be pretty cool.

186
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
There's no point.

187
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
So no word on when it's going to come out or how much it's going to be,

188
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
but I can tell you right now...

189
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Or how drunk you won't get playing it.

190
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Yeah, how drunk you won't get.

191
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,100
I feel totally wasted right now.

192
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Well, you can always add alcohol to it, so you know.

193
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,100
You may be in a cramped dorm and may not have room to set up a beer pong setup,

194
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,100
so you know what, this will help you out.

195
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
All right.

196
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Well, if there's one thing in the world better than beer pong,

197
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,100
it's Spinal and Orchid and Glacius.

198
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Was that his name?

199
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Combo Breaker.

200
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Combo Breaker and all those characters that were in Killer Instinct.

201
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I'll be damned if this rumor doesn't come up once a year.

202
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,100
It's back, and it's thanks to EGM and the Quarterman.

203
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
He always has us call him an EGM.

204
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Apparently, Rare is going to be making a third entry in the Killer Instinct franchise.

205
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Of course, Rare has denied this before,

206
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
but apparently there is a game in the works, Killer Instinct 3D.

207
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Death, Destruction, and Doom.

208
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Get it? 3Ds.

209
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Death, Destruction, and Doom.

210
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
It's apparently on the Xbox 360.

211
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Will she still have the boob attack?

212
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
I hope so.

213
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Yes, please.

214
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Apparently, though, it will not be using the pre-rendered stuff

215
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
that was seen in the previous game.

216
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
There's kind of a bummer.

217
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,100
It'll just be 3D visuals and more robust gameplay, whatever that means.

218
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Bigger bus.

219
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Yay!

220
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Bigger bus.

221
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Because Maya had some pretty big busts.

222
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I don't know if you saw that,

223
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
but that was a combo breaker of a different kind.

224
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,100
It should be more mobust replay.

225
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Ultra combo me any day.

226
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
All right.

227
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
I don't know.

228
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Take with a giant grain of salt,

229
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
but I don't think any of us would complain if this were true.

230
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Right?

231
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
I know I wouldn't.

232
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
You know what they should do when there's a game that's being announced

233
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
that everyone's been rumoring for it to come out for a long time?

234
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,100
They should send everybody in the press a giant grain of salt.

235
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
That would be hilarious.

236
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
That would be fun.

237
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Good idea.

238
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I need a moment.

239
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
My browser just died.

240
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Uh-oh.

241
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
So we can't get to the next story now?

242
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm all over it.

243
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
What are we going to do?

244
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,100
The show has collapsed.

245
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
All right.

246
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Quickly then, some more discussion.

247
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Things you would most want to see in Killer Instinct 3.

248
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
What do you think Killer Instinct 3 needs more than anything?

249
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Jubblies.

250
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Banjo-Kazooie.

251
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
No, it does not.

252
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
As a character.

253
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Okay, it's up.

254
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
All right, thank God.

255
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,100
There are supposed to be new colors for the DS in Europe

256
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,100
if anyone gives half a crap.

257
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Puke green, according to Tiara.

258
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
There is.

259
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Monkey snot.

260
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I like how the article said slime green.

261
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
That's actually lime green.

262
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Hot red and ice blue.

263
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,100
And it's supposed to have dates of June 13th.

264
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
But we don't know.

265
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Hot red.

266
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Ice blue.

267
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Sounds like stripper names.

268
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Hot red.

269
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Lime green.

270
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Oh, yeah.

271
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
That sounds like American Gladiators.

272
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
I was just thinking that.

273
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Nice.

274
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,100
By the way, American Gladiators, one of those shows that's so bad it's good.

275
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
I watch American Gladiators every week.

276
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Good times.

277
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
You would.

278
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I love American Gladiators.

279
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
It's great.

280
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
I hope they make a new game.

281
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,100
All I have to say is that in the previews, Atlas Sphere is coming back this year.

282
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
By the way.

283
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Thank God.

284
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
What?

285
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
My man won.

286
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I am pleased.

287
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
The old American Gladiators season one?

288
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
No, American Idol.

289
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Oh, American Idol.

290
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,100
I thought you didn't want him to win because then he would be stuck in the record contract.

291
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,100
I was sort of at half months because I wanted him to win so that David Archuleta's dad would

292
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
have an aneurysm.

293
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Are we really having American Idol?

294
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm not having this discussion.

295
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
All right.

296
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Thank God.

297
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Okay, I'm done.

298
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
All right.

299
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Next topic.

300
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Anyways.

301
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
So, yeah.

302
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Something I've been distracted by lately.

303
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,100
The Wii Homebrew channel has been released.

304
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Yes, they've gotten it so bad now to where they can inject their own channels into the

305
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Wii.

306
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,100
And it's just insane the amount of stuff that you can do now.

307
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Emulators, games, you name it.

308
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,100
It's available and hopefully I'll be demonstrating it a little bit later.

309
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
But yes, it is available now.

310
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,100
You can install it using the Twilight hack, which is actually pretty interesting in the

311
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
way it works.

312
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
But pretty simple to do.

313
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
There's instructions all over the internet.

314
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,100
So if you want to get your homebrew on while it, you know, works, feel free to check your

315
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,100
local Wii hacking community forums and you should be able to find it.

316
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Yeah.

317
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,100
We reached out to Nintendo for some comment on what they were going to do about this situation

318
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,100
and what they had to say about this whole thing.

319
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
That's all they had to say.

320
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Is this going to be the new sandstorm?

321
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
That's all they had to say.

322
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,100
No, because we can't drop E and rave.

323
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
It is quite sexy.

324
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
And hump the coin return of a potter potter machine.

325
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
They do have a bunch of stuff out for it right now.

326
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
You can get ScummVM for it.

327
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,100
They actually have a Tetris game that's someone's program.

328
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,100
There's emulators for practically everything Nintendo 64, Turbo Graphics, Game Boy Color

329
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Games, NES, Super NES.

330
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,100
They have a region free player for GameCube games.

331
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
You can build that in there.

332
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
They've also got, you can upload Miis to it.

333
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
You can totally customize the stuff.

334
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
It's extremely easy to use.

335
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,100
And yeah, so more of that later.

336
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Including the ability to play Guardian Legend.

337
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Do you think that this, just real quick before we move on,

338
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
do you think this is something that they'll block in a future patch?

339
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
I mean, wouldn't this be very easy to close the hole in it?

340
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100
They may be able to, but it's going to be pretty hard.

341
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Or is this going to be like the PSP where it's ongoing?

342
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I think it's going to be ongoing.

343
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
They haven't been able to block the Twilight hack thing,

344
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
so that's going to be hard.

345
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Even if this homebrew channel thing gets blocked,

346
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
you can still use that Twilight hack to load almost anything you want.

347
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
This just makes it simpler.

348
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
It puts it all on your SD memory card.

349
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Instead of having to load individual programs,

350
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
you can just keep it all on there.

351
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Just visit this channel and load any homebrew programs you want.

352
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
And I think it looks pretty nice.

353
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,100
I mean, it's got the animations just like the other channels.

354
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
It's really professionally done.

355
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Alright, well going back over to Nintendo for a little bit.

356
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
And Nintendo and Mistwalker's relationship.

357
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
You know, Mistwalker, of course, they have some games on the Xbox 360.

358
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Kind of something interesting you may not realize.

359
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Nintendo doesn't really have anything officially on the calendar right now

360
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
after Wii Fit has been out.

361
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
They're probably going to wait for E3 to really unveil

362
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
whatever else is coming out for the rest of the year.

363
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,100
But, thank you ESRB, who's given us a lot of news this week.

364
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,100
The ESRB did rate a game called ASH, Archaic Sealed Heat.

365
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,100
And this is a game that's coming out on the Nintendo DS.

366
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
This is a game that already came out in Japan.

367
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
So if it's been rated by the ESRB,

368
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
then there must be a localization on the way.

369
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
But that is interesting because that shows that Mistwalker

370
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
is developing for more things than just Xbox.

371
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
But there is kind of that weird relationship with Microsoft's own studio

372
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
because there's the Viva Pinata game already announced for DS as well.

373
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Well, THQ is doing a lot of those and same with the Blue Dragon DS game too.

374
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Yeah, so it's not like Microsoft properties are afraid to go over to DS,

375
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
which I think further cements the fact there won't be a Microsoft handheld anytime soon.

376
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
So those rumors can just go away.

377
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Did you hear about how they were originally thinking about adding connectivity

378
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,100
with Viva Pinata 2 and the Viva Pinata DS?

379
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
That would be very interesting, but could they do it?

380
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Well, the way they had it done, it was only one way.

381
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,100
You could transfer stuff from your DS version to your Xbox 360.

382
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
And the way they did it was, I don't know, there was another story coming out

383
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,100
that they were going to have cards that you could buy

384
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
or something that would allow you to...

385
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
It's essentially like the Eye of Judgment card.

386
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
I was going to say, this sounds like Eye of Judgment to me.

387
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
But yeah, that's how the game would work.

388
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
It would produce a high resolution picture on there,

389
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
and then you would scan it with your camera.

390
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Speaking of Eye of Judgment, I looked at the OLR Wiki this week,

391
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
where we've got awesome people maintaining the OLR Wiki

392
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
at orangelaunchradio.wiki.com.

393
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
You can learn a lot of stuff about the inside jokes of our show and everything.

394
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Apparently, the Eye of Judgment has sold now 200,000 units.

395
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
We're one-fifth of the way there.

396
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Never going to happen. Never going to happen.

397
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,100
I just love the fact that that's actually being tracked and updated on a regular basis.

398
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Love it.

399
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Start squirming, Loki. Start squirming.

400
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Love it.

401
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
It's not going to happen.

402
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
It'll happen. All right.

403
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news.

404
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
No, we're not. We're going to go to the mailbag, because...

405
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I refuse.

406
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
It's probably very full. Too bad.

407
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I refuse.

408
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Too bad.

409
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Then let the ferret read the emails tonight.

410
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Hell no. I won't read.

411
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Let TRR read them. I don't care.

412
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
We've got to do some emails.

413
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
No, the only one I'm going to read is hers.

414
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
All right, mailbag.

415
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
You're only going to read one email after two weeks being gone?

416
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
Yeah.

417
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
What do we want?

418
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Plus a few others.

419
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
All right, thank you.

420
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
All right, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to participate.

421
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,100
TRR Sakura, open up the mailbag, pull out a few of your favorites, and read them.

422
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,100
This one says, dear people, my girlfriend wants a DS and a PSP.

423
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
She has a PS3.

424
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Please use...

425
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh, my God.

426
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Please use a period.

427
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Thank you.

428
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Okay, what was I saying?

429
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Oh, yeah.

430
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I was wondering...

431
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Did I mention when you email us, Jamie berates you?

432
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
I was wondering.

433
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
She's only 16, and I'm wondering.

434
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
You already said you were wondering.

435
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:26,100
If you had any ideas for a game to buy her, she'd love music, RPGs, and FPS.

436
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,100
What teen-rated games in those genre are good so I can make her a happy gamer girl?

437
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Peace out, dsmaster25 and dsloverps.

438
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
We worship Hannah Montana.

439
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Woeship, W-O-E.

440
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
I woeship her, too.

441
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I would make a suggestion as for a good game to get her.

442
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
For the DS?

443
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
My word, coach.

444
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Yes.

445
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,100
But you haven't really specified what system since you mentioned that she wants a DS and

446
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
PSP, indicating that she has neither.

447
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Typing of the Dead.

448
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
And has a PS3.

449
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Yeah, I get Typing of the Dead.

450
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,100
If they get a PSP, there's not a lot of music games available for it.

451
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Actually, there's no music games available for it in the United States.

452
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Guitar Man.

453
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Guitar Man, yeah, that's about it.

454
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Brappa.

455
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,100
I suggest getting her an Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip on it.

456
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Ooh.

457
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Our first person shooters, you're going to find a few of them on the PSP, not so many

458
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
on the DS.

459
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Give her a baby.

460
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
It's what she really wants.

461
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Give her Imagine Babies.

462
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,100
She can have my copy.

463
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
I played it.

464
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
You saw me play it.

465
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Tell her you're getting ready for your long future together.

466
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Anyways, so then I would, I don't know.

467
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
We're never going to get another email ever again.

468
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,100
If she already has a PS3, you might as well just stick with the PSP, because then you

469
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
can connect to it and download stuff via the PlayStation Store.

470
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
That's true.

471
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,100
There's also PlayStation 1 games that are available on there, and also if you want to

472
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,100
really hack the thing apart, you can play all the sorts of emulators and that kind of

473
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
stuff.

474
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,100
You can also do the same thing with the DS as well.

475
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
So, really, it's how much you want to spend.

476
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
The PSP is going to be more expensive for you.

477
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Whereas the DS, you can find it cheaper and you can probably get a game for it for the

478
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
same price.

479
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Right.

480
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,100
And then you can put, you know what, if you get a, the nice thing about the PSP versus

481
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,100
the DS is that you can set themes on the PSP.

482
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,100
So what you can do is you can put a picture of yourself in the background on the PSP so

483
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,100
that she can always take you with her wherever she goes as a constant reminder of your undying

484
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
love for each other.

485
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
There you go.

486
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,100
I also think that you should install a dictionary and a thesaurus and a grammar checker for

487
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
your phone.

488
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,100
I think that this is cool because I honestly think that this person is Russian or from

489
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
somewhere that uses the same form of alphabet.

490
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I'm not really all that great with names.

491
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,100
But it's in the best screen cap ever.

492
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:59,100
It's a Google search to define STFU and definitions of STFU on the web, this is the only one that

493
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,100
came up, is a weekly half hour show hosted by, it brings up the stuff on the show.

494
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Nice, so an old reference to the show that DMN hosted on the network.

495
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Yeah, DJ Tyrant too.

496
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Yes, and DJ Tyrant.

497
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
DMN, I don't think DJ Tyrant is involved with this, maybe it's a special guest or something,

498
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,100
but DMN has teamed up with Travis Donovan and they now do a show on All Games Radio,

499
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,100
if you haven't heard it yet, it's Under Sedation Live 4.0.

500
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,100
So it's the show that Jamie and I started on, all grown up and retarded.

501
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I was the number one guest.

502
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
You were.

503
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Plus I filled in for Jessica.

504
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
But now they're up to 4.0.

505
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I filled in for you a couple of times.

506
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Sure did, because I was lazy.

507
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Where are they now? Rob Roberts.

508
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
I got to speak, sit in the speaker chair.

509
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
I just wanted to give a cheap plug.

510
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Which we found the speaker chair.

511
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Really?

512
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
At the Desiree thrift store.

513
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Nice.

514
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
We checked.

515
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Nice.

516
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
A few years ago.

517
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Next email.

518
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Okay, this one comes from Sauce.

519
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Okay, wait, you have to explain for listeners.

520
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Listeners don't know Sauce.

521
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
What is Sauce?

522
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,100
There are a group of us who have known each other for probably going on

523
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
over ten years online.

524
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,100
And Kim, who is one of the group, used to always call me Sis.

525
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
But she's like a terrible typer.

526
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
And she's like the typo queen.

527
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,100
So one day she typoed and instead of, she was trying to say,

528
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Sits on Sis.

529
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,100
And she put Sots on Sauce.

530
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,100
And so ever since then, I've been Sauce. S-O-S.

531
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,100
And it just kind of, we made up names for everybody.

532
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Like after that.

533
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Very nice.

534
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
And mine is, when we get together, it's Soy Sauce Reunion.

535
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Soy Sauce.

536
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Cute.

537
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
It works.

538
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
So, hello Sos, Rob, and otherwise.

539
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Girls are so weird, I swear.

540
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Get ferreted.

541
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Burn it.

542
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Okay, this is the Uberlong review.

543
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Alright.

544
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm writing to give a review of the new Iron Man game that was

545
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,100
released on many platforms at the beginning of the month.

546
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
The version of the game I have is the PSP version and as such

547
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
the review is for that particular version.

548
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Thank you for clarifying.

549
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,100
The game itself only has a small amount of storyline related to

550
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
the movie itself.

551
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,100
This may throw off players that have never read any Iron Man

552
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
or to a lesser extent Marvel comics.

553
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
But it's a great treat for true fans.

554
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Subplots include such Iron Man favorites as,

555
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,100
I never pronounced this right, the Magia.

556
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Whitney Frost, also known as Madame Mask and Titanium Man.

557
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,100
The bulk of the plot involves AIM.

558
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
I hate them.

559
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
I hate scrolls worse.

560
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
The story is good.

561
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,100
The graphics are more than fairly decent as is most of the voice

562
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
acting.

563
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Tony Stark is much more brash and cocky than he is in the movie.

564
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,100
And even I was surprised by some of the things he said.

565
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
There are also plenty of unlockables to keep players busy

566
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,100
using weapons of three different types, repulsor,

567
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
gabbling gun and rockets.

568
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Unlocks better weapons and progressing through the game

569
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
unlocks different armors.

570
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
There are of course the Mark 1 through 3 armors in the movie

571
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,100
plus the golden Avenger armor, the classic red and gold armor,

572
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,100
stealth armor and the titanium man armor.

573
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Other unlockables include death races where you fly through

574
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
marker beacons as fast as possible while avoiding enemy

575
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,100
fire and speed kills where you see how many enemies you can

576
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
defeat before time runs out.

577
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Now I can take a breath.

578
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
You were really busy.

579
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Okay.

580
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
The drawback to this game, at least on the PSP,

581
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
is the way the player controls the game.

582
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
The controls are very uncomfortable and took me quite a bit

583
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,100
to get used to, especially the flying mechanics.

584
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
There is no option to change or rearrange the controls

585
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
to make them easier to use.

586
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,100
Using the square XO triangle buttons to control the camera

587
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,100
and analog stick to control pushing forward backwards motion

588
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
was very uncomfortable for me, especially since pushing up

589
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
on the analog stick makes you walk or hover forward,

590
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,100
but moving into flight mode makes pushing up on the analog stick

591
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,100
actually makes you go crashing down so it reverses from

592
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,100
standard running around mode to like jet controls.

593
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Okay.

594
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
All right.

595
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Whereas pushing down on the analog stick makes you pull back up.

596
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,100
I suppose in a way this makes sense, but the sudden reversal

597
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,100
of the controls makes flying a pain, especially when you wind up

598
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
running around and then jumping into flight a lot.

599
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
It took me two run-throughs of the training level

600
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,100
to get used to the controls, and even after 13 levels of play,

601
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm still hindered by the awkward controls.

602
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Overall, Iron Man for the PSP is a fun game.

603
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
The controls, however, definitely detract from it overall.

604
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,100
If you're a die-hard Iron Man fan like I am, then she is.

605
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
This is worth having in your collection.

606
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
However, if your knowledge of Iron Man is based solely on the movie,

607
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
I wouldn't bother.

608
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
My overall rating for this game is 6.5 out of 10.

609
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Thanks, and keep up the great job with the show, T.R.I.P.S.

610
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Rob is so eating cake on my birthday, frowning face.

611
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
We'll see. We'll see.

612
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
But that was a good review.

613
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,100
You should write reviews for our website whenever we get it working.

614
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
You should be. I already knew you were working.

615
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Yes, ReviewWench.

616
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Actually, Sauce has their own theme song, and so we can play it.

617
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Can you hear me, darling? Can't you hear me? S.O.S.

618
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
No, I have to explain this.

619
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Remember in the old days when I had my own show, Sniff Cry Wine?

620
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Right.

621
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I would randomly play the...

622
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,100
What was that group that did all the boob and dick songs?

623
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
I don't know.

624
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Oh, no. Erotic.

625
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Oh, Erotic.

626
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
I would play Erotic's version.

627
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Yes.

628
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
But the tiger took my family.

629
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
That was... No.

630
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
I would play Erotic's...

631
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
But, no.

632
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
I would play Erotic's version.

633
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
No.

634
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
So that's officially... That is officially...

635
00:27:52,100 --> 00:28:01,100
One Orange Jug video.

636
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Boob, dick, boob, dick, boob, dick.

637
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Come on, if you have something, come help me dodge your dick.

638
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
We know this well.

639
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
But this will come into play later.

640
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,100
You know, some day in your nightmare, somebody's gonna crop that little piece of show

641
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
and play that over and over.

642
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,100
They have a song called Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

643
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
And the very first song...

644
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
And they were huge in DDR, by the way.

645
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
And the very first song I ever heard by them was before...

646
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
Was actually when I had played Beat...

647
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Was still playing Beatmania 98 before we even had a 2DX.

648
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Or when DDR was still just a thought.

649
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Was Don't Talk Dirty.

650
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
It was like the best video.

651
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Max...

652
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
What's the lyric?

653
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
That's the first part of the song.

654
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Max, Max, call me Max.

655
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
I'm taking what it gives and I'm giving what it takes.

656
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Max, Max, Max.

657
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
I'm in love with you and I want you.

658
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
I miss DDR when it was like at song play incidents.

659
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

660
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I gotta warn you.

661
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

662
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
It will make your life complex.

663
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Max, Max, Max.

664
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
These songs are available on iTunes, by the way.

665
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
And I highly suggest you buy the entire thing.

666
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Buy the entire thing.

667
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
We cannot make this shit up.

668
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Well, we could, but we're actually telling the truth.

669
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
We could, but, you know, yeah.

670
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Next email!

671
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Wait, hold on.

672
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Just, I have to read the...

673
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Look, I have the album Greatest Tits.

674
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Here's the songs on Greatest Tits.

675
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
The horniest single in the world.

676
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

677
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Willy Use a Billy Boy.

678
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Help Me Dr. Dick.

679
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Fred Come to Bed.

680
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Turn Me On.

681
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Gotta Get It Groovin'.

682
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Gimme Good Sex.

683
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Fritz Love My Tits.

684
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Sex on the Phone.

685
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Sexual Madness.

686
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
SOS.

687
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
The Winner Takes It All.

688
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Baby Please Me.

689
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
And In the Dark of the Night.

690
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Cause we all know what happens in the dark of the night.

691
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,100
We have booty calls all over the stuff.

692
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,100
We have two ABBA songs and, um, yeah.

693
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
So next email, okay?

694
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
I used to love Sex on the Phone, though.

695
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
This song was awesome.

696
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:20,100
But it doesn't have Don't Talk Dirty on it.

697
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
They have tons of albums.

698
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
It's not just the Greatest Tits.

699
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
There's just tons.

700
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Next email.

701
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Next email.

702
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Dear Mailbag, like it can talk back, I'd like to think you all will have caught this piece

703
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,100
of news, but since it was tagged onto the end of another story, I want to make sure

704
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
you didn't miss it.

705
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,100
I know that Skye, at least, is a huge fan of Actraiser.

706
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,100
And there's a link that says, loves you, Apollo.

707
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,100
This message is not brought to you by Taco Bell because it is gross.

708
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,100
It's on Gamasutra.

709
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
I like what I'm hearing already about Actraiser.

710
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Square Enix is talking about WiiWare and new Actraiser possibilities.

711
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Like an Actraiser game on WiiWare?

712
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,100
I will save this for the end of the show.

713
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
That's awesome.

714
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,100
I will make you wait in anticipation.

715
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Thanks.

716
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm not going to say anything.

717
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Until Rob decides to play me some more Erotic.

718
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
You want some more Erotic?

719
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
No.

720
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,100
So that means you have to wait a really fucking long time.

721
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Actually, do you have some?

722
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
Do I have Don't Talk Dirty?

723
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
I don't know.

724
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
You should play it after the show.

725
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
If I can find it.

726
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
I don't know if I have it.

727
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
We'll see.

728
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Next email.

729
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:58,100
This is an iTunes sample.

730
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
It doesn't have the actual chorus in there.

731
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Don't Talk Dirty was great.

732
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Is the music in the background of your FUs of the Week,

733
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Jumpman by Buckethead, or did you remix it?

734
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
I know.

735
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
I remixed it from Jumpman by Buckethead.

736
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
Oh, you did?

737
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Okay.

738
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Pointless question by TJ Zeppelinz in the chat.

739
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,100
And since I wasn't on the mic, I remixed that from Jumpman by Buckethead.

740
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Yes.

741
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
That was where my O came from.

742
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Hey.

743
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Hey, you.

744
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Get out of my car.

745
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Hey, listen.

746
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Yesterday I listened to the Bobby Black Wolf Show and OLR

747
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
on the PSP's official internet radio player.

748
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,100
The quality was really good and there were no interruptions

749
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
except for the times I disconnected and tried to reconnect.

750
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
I have a couple of questions.

751
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,100
One, is there any way to set the presets on the player?

752
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Is there another player that will work on the official Sony firmware?

753
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Sometimes it was hard to find the all-game stream.

754
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Sadly, I don't think there is.

755
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I've played with that whole thing limitedly on the PSP.

756
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
I don't think there is a way to do it, sadly.

757
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,100
The PSP thing is very limited.

758
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
It sucks.

759
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Rob, you are a pain in my neck.

760
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Sorry.

761
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
It's okay.

762
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Two.

763
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:19,100
And for your intro.

764
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Anyhow.

765
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
I need a ferret.

766
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Hey, listen.

767
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Hey, listen.

768
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Hey, listen.

769
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Thank you, Rob.

770
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
Two.

771
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,100
Is there any PSP-compatible way of IRC chatting?

772
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Listening live is great, but I want to chat, too.

773
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
Alpha Canagram says it's called Free Play.

774
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
It works for official firmware.

775
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm using it now and he's in chat, so.

776
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
Okay.

777
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,100
I also posted this in chat because I think the PSP and other devices

778
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,100
could eventually be portable Internet radio devices

779
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
that could receive shows from all over the world.

780
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
And the next question.

781
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,100
When is the fuck show going to happen or has Black Wolf already shot that one down?

782
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Well, I guess Understudiation Live 4.0 does have that one every Saturday.

783
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
LOL.

784
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Thanks, PKJunior92.

785
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
No matter where you go, you're there.

786
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
We've said fuck and half a lot this episode, though, haven't we?

787
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,100
If we told you when it was, that would break the rules of the fuck show.

788
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Yes, the fuck show is a surprise.

789
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I will tell you when it is not.

790
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,100
The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

791
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,100
And the sixth anniversary show is going to be...

792
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Whatever the fuck we want it.

793
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
June...

794
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
On the sixth anniversary.

795
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
It can either be the...

796
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Probably the 22nd is the closest.

797
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,100
June 22nd will be our sixth birthday.

798
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
So I don't know what we're doing for that yet.

799
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Wow.

800
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Yeah.

801
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Sixth birthday.

802
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
Wow.

803
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Yeah, I know.

804
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
For real.

805
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Our show is old enough to be in first grade.

806
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Wow.

807
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,100
Six years ago, Orange Launch Radio started.

808
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
I know.

809
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
It's crazy.

810
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Fuck.

811
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,100
That's what I said.

812
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
All right.

813
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
So...

814
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Next email.

815
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Oh my god.

816
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I've got three left.

817
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Okay.

818
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,100
I'm trying to be nice because we weren't here last weekend.

819
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Is there...

820
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
Okay.

821
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Oh, we have one called...

822
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Hello.

823
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Hello.

824
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Is there anyone there?

825
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Have you fallen off the world?

826
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I miss you.

827
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Sad face Rick from UK.

828
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I think that was when our stream went forever with no new updates.

829
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Part B went out on Friday or Saturday.

830
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
So hopefully...

831
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Yes, we're still alive.

832
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Rob had the plague.

833
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Yes, I had SARS.

834
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
No, no, no, no, no.

835
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
They put him on the cart even.

836
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,100
He was about to get carried off to the incendiary area.

837
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,100
But then you said he was going to go out for a walk.

838
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I actually would.

839
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
When I was in the hospital, I remember being rolled around on a bed.

840
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
It was kind of an interesting experience.

841
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
I never really had that before.

842
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Did you...

843
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
I'm not quite dead yet.

844
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
I feel happy.

845
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,100
I remember them rolling me out of the ER, into the room with the ultrasound, and rolling

846
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
me into the CAT scan room.

847
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Did you hallucinate?

848
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Huh?

849
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Did you hallucinate?

850
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
No.

851
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Poor Rob.

852
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
I can make you hallucinate right now.

853
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Sometimes I think doing this show is hallucinating.

854
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,100
We could bring Shermy over.

855
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,100
She could fart on you.

856
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Next email.

857
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
My cat got it back.

858
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
I was going to say my cat pooped the rubber band today.

859
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,100
I'm so fucking proud.

860
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,100
I am so fucking proud of you.

861
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Shermy's not proud of her.

862
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm not really.

863
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Is that what this show is resorted to?

864
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
But cats are like your children.

865
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Fuck!

866
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,100
Coming up in Wii news, oh my cat pooped out a rubber band today.

867
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,100
I'm very concerned because that means she ate a rubber band.

868
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
It could have killed her.

869
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
My cat eats grass.

870
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
She loves grass.

871
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,100
Seriously, fuck this show.

872
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Can I read the next email?

873
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Sure.

874
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
I don't care anymore.

875
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Sauce says I can't so this segment's over.

876
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Okay.

877
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Hello everyone in the world.

878
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,100
We may as well be fucking doing a drunk show because we're all lunatics.

879
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Seriously.

880
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,100
I would be drinking right now if it wouldn't kill me.

881
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,100
For those of you who do not know me, I don't know you so okay.

882
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
No, I'm kidding.

883
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,100
My name is Chris Phillips aka ChrisPhil1724.

884
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Hi Chris.

885
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Must be a really old school name.

886
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,100
A tournament slash event organizer for all games and all games.com.

887
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Oh yeah, he used to do video stuff for all games.

888
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
I know he is.

889
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,100
He's a good man, Charlie Brown.

890
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Don't cough up a rubber band.

891
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
No.

892
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
It was something a lot more delicious, Rob.

893
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
All right.

894
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
I'm going to get cookies.

895
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
Yum.

896
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Anyway, on July...

897
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Do the fanfare.

898
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,100
I got to find the...

899
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
This means fanfare.

900
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,100
I don't have a fanfare so this will have to do.

901
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I'm July 24th, 2005.

902
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Bobby Black Wolf aired his first live show on all games radio.

903
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Known as The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

904
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,100
This show was, in fact, the first ever weekly podcast on all games radio.

905
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Ever since that date, The Bobby Black Wolf Show has aired a new show every Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, 5 p.m. PST.

906
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,100
A streak that has lasted nearly 35 months.

907
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:13,100
This weekend was marked as the first week in 147 weeks without a new episode of The Bobby Black Wolf Show ending his remarkable run.

908
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Now Bobby would never broadcast this noteworthy accomplishment and we may not even like the fact that I'm doing this.

909
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,100
There's fellow podcasters, you all know how hard it is to do a show week in and week out.

910
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,100
To that end, my fieldless achievement is worth mentioning and congratulations are in order.

911
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
If you'd like to write a small email to Bobby or...

912
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

913
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
We're doing it live, Bobby!

914
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Yay!

915
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Well done, Darth Zagre.

916
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Let's hear it for Bobby Black Wolf.

917
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Let's hear it.

918
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,100
I was looking for the moaning noises, but alright.

919
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,100
No, that is a good accomplishment.

920
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,100
It really is. I mean, god, we're lucky if we go ten weeks.

921
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Alright.

922
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Dear OLR and Loki 2.

923
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,100
You know how that's gonna go.

924
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,100
You're going to know in the first four words how that's going to go.

925
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,100
I have a Macintosh and I don't use it to play games.

926
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,100
I can understand why Loki would not like a Macintosh computer because he uses his computer to play video games.

927
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Now can we shut up about this whole Loki hates Macintoshes thing?

928
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,100
They just don't deserve, they just don't serve his needs.

929
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
To be honest, we sort of dropped this long ass fucking time ago.

930
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
It's the listeners that keep bringing it up.

931
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
Am I right?

932
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,100
Well, once in a while there'll be a story and he'll make a snide comment that reminds us.

933
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,100
But I don't think there's been a good old fashioned brawl over it in a while.

934
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
The only people bringing it up is the fucking Mac users.

935
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,100
My wife does this every time a stupid Mac commercial comes on TV.

936
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
She's like, see, they said it's true.

937
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I'm like, shut up.

938
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
It's on TV, it must be true.

939
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,100
I'll never forget when the Mac fan came to Fauna Mae.

940
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Aw shit, I remember that last year.

941
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Which, by the way, notice we're not at Fauna Mae this year.

942
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
It has other things to do.

943
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
It was a conspiracy by Mac users.

944
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
No, we'll be back at Fauna Mae next year, I promise.

945
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
We have to.

946
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,100
If we're still around. My god, we're getting old.

947
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
You are.

948
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
If we don't die of old age first.

949
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
You're gonna die of the plague.

950
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Thanks.

951
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,100
I'm gonna die of awesome.

952
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Dr. Mario will cure it.

953
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm gonna die of awesome.

954
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Alright, are you gonna read any more of this email?

955
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Should I?

956
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
Pick a paragraph. Read a paragraph.

957
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
That's not why I wrote.

958
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,100
I wrote because I have a few things I want to say about Nintendo.

959
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Okay, whatever.

960
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Um.

961
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,100
It's basically saying that Nintendo sells a lot of stuff.

962
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,100
The end.

963
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Maybe you should post that on the super long email of the weak thread.

964
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
I'm actually going to do that because right now my throat hurts.

965
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,100
And it actually is from Hippolytus, aka Black Boy, who we remember.

966
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Yes.

967
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,100
You are actually going to be the person who brings back

968
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,100
The long ass fucking email thread of the weak.

969
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,100
On OrangeDownsRadio.com

970
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Congratulations.

971
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
I want to be the person who brings sexy back.

972
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Does this call for fanfare?

973
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,100
Yes.

974
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Just because honestly, honestly, honestly.

975
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,100
It's a good email, but my throat hurts a lot.

976
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,100
I will post it on the forums and link it in the chat room.

977
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Long email is long.

978
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
Yes.

979
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Long email is very long.

980
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Long email is long.

981
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,100
If you want to send us long emails, mailbag at OrangeDownsRadio.com

982
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
Meantime, more gaming news.

983
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Yes, Loki?

984
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Yes.

985
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
Um.

986
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
I was just reading something else that's kind of interesting.

987
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,100
But this is sort of interesting.

988
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
It'd be more interesting if it weren't the end gauge.

989
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
But yes.

990
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Ear taco.

991
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Metal Gear Solid Mobile has somehow found its way on the end gauge.

992
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
That's right.

993
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,100
You will be able to play Metal Gear Solid.

994
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,100
The winner of two 2007 International Mobile Gaming Awards.

995
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:11,100
And apparently it's coming to the end gauge shortly after the launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 for the PS3.

996
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,100
So that's cool I guess.

997
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,100
At least they're getting some actual big name games.

998
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
The end gauge is still around.

999
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Yeah.

1000
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Well, do you remember Nolan Bushnell?

1001
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
I hope you do.

1002
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
Yes, because he gave us Pizza Time Theater.

1003
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Yes.

1004
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
And Chuck E. Cheese.

1005
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Right?

1006
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,100
That was Pizza Time Theater.

1007
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
Well, whatever.

1008
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
The name better.

1009
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
And Pong.

1010
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Pizza Time Theater.

1011
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,100
Right?

1012
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Yes.

1013
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Well, he apparently was speaking at the Wedbush Morgan Securities Annual Management Access Conference.

1014
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,100
And he's saying the game piracy, it's on its way out.

1015
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:59,100
It says, quote, there is a stealth encryption chip called the TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now.

1016
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:06,100
What that says is that in the games business we will be able to encrypt with an absolutely verifiable private key in the encryption world,

1017
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:14,100
which is uncrackable by people on the internet, and by giving away passwords which will allow for a huge market to develop in some of the areas where piracy has been a real problem.

1018
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,100
It's not going to work.

1019
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Why is that?

1020
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Because everything can be cracked.

1021
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,100
And the fact that you said that it can't be cracked is just going to make people want to crack it.

1022
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,100
It is an invitation to the crackers to say please crack this.

1023
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Trust me.

1024
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,100
If it can be modified, it will be modified on the board.

1025
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Or they'll find a way to emulate it and they'll just disable it.

1026
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
There are ways to do everything.

1027
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,100
It has been done before.

1028
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,100
What I did think was interesting is that he does say, though, that movies and music, though, that's unstoppable.

1029
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
Quote, if you can watch it and you can hear it, you can copy it.

1030
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,100
He says games are a different thing because games are so integrated with the code.

1031
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,100
The TPM will, in fact, absolutely stop piracy of gameplay.

1032
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:57,100
As soon as the installed base of the TPM hardware chip gets large enough, we will start to see revenues coming from Asia and India at a time when before it didn't make sense.

1033
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Or they'll just stop buying games altogether.

1034
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Of course he wants to say that it can't be cracked because he wants to sell it to, you know, said companies that make motherboards.

1035
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Obviously they want to do that because, you know, ideally it should work.

1036
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:16,100
But the problem is people out there want to steal games more than, you know...

1037
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,100
I mean, look at this. Okay, put it this way.

1038
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:27,100
There are games out there now that have it, you know, where you have to play it, you know, and it talks to a server online to validate that it's an official copy of the game.

1039
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
Those have been cracked.

1040
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,100
You know, there's stuff on the PSP that they've had countless firmware upgrades that are supposed to prevent piracy and stuff.

1041
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Those have all been cracked.

1042
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,100
I mean, what makes...

1043
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Rama in chat, chat.orangesonshooter.com says, Intel tried that with their Pentium 3 chips and boards. It didn't work.

1044
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Yeah, I mean, it's a nice attempt and, you know, people should be a little bit more legit with stuff, but it's just not gonna happen.

1045
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,100
It really isn't, so...

1046
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,100
I don't know.

1047
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Just because you stop people from pirating a game does not mean that they are gonna go buy your game.

1048
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
That's the other problem too.

1049
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Because they're assuming that people that are pirating these things had intended to buy it in the first place.

1050
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,100
That's not always the case.

1051
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,100
That's a good point. I think a lot of pirates probably wouldn't even bother buying the games.

1052
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
I really think that.

1053
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:22,100
But it sounds like maybe he's trying to combat piracy in other countries, not necessarily just the US, but where it's way more rampant.

1054
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
You think that might be the case?

1055
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:33,100
Good luck. I mean, but, you know, if anything, you know, the Chinese and stuff, they've gotten piracy down big time, so...

1056
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,100
I don't see this affecting much.

1057
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Alright, well, I don't know about you guys, but I get the feeling we've heard this all before, and when I hear things and I don't see results, I get irritated.

1058
00:45:45,100 --> 00:46:03,100
And when I get irritated, we do the FUs of the week.

1059
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,100
FU to the dollar store.

1060
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,100
We went to get a USB cable, and there were none out on the shelf.

1061
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:15,100
The whole supply of them wasn't there, so I asked if someone would go and look in the back and see if there were any.

1062
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Just about any other store I go to, people are willing to look in the back and just, oh, we don't have any.

1063
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,100
That was it.

1064
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
Loki.

1065
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,100
FU to the virtual friends in Grand Theft Auto IV.

1066
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:33,100
I don't want to go do activities with you. That's why I'm not calling you back, you idiots.

1067
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
But at least they have sleep mode.

1068
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,100
You do know it's a video game, right?

1069
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:41,100
Yes, it's still annoying, though, when you have people going, I haven't heard from you forever, I want to go drinking.

1070
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,100
It's like, fuck that, I have to shoot pigeons.

1071
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
So they don't understand.

1072
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:57,100
My FU of the week goes to the antibiotic C-Pro, which I was taking because the doctor thought I had an infection, even though I'm pretty sure I had a virus based on the high fever I had and the fact that the antibiotics didn't really work.

1073
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:06,100
But I was taking it for so long that finally my chest started to tighten up and I got a big ol' red rash on my chest, so I stopped taking it.

1074
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,100
Because that's not a good reaction to have, especially when you just have pancreatitis.

1075
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
So I chose to stop taking it.

1076
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,100
So FU to C-Pro.

1077
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Drunami.

1078
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:22,100
FU to friends, so-called friends who make their mission in life to bring your ass down.

1079
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
I'm not naming names.

1080
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,100
No one, anyone here would know.

1081
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:33,100
FU to rock band and all its goodness for making my throat hurt like hell.

1082
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,100
And...

1083
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
FU to Mellow Gear Solid 2.

1084
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Stop busting me.

1085
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,100
Alright.

1086
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Just because I suck.

1087
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
Chiaraara.

1088
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,100
Anything you want to say FU to?

1089
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,100
I'm good, thanks.

1090
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,100
Aw.

1091
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
FU to you for being so happy.

1092
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Yeah, really, we're jealous.

1093
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
I know, what's your secret?

1094
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,100
Alright.

1095
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
That's gonna do it for the FUs of the Week.

1096
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,100
Let's get back into some gaming news.

1097
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,100
DarkSakura's gonna take it.

1098
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,100
Well, she's coughing.

1099
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
I just wanted to ask, are you sure you didn't have anthrax?

1100
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
Because C-Pro is what they give you if you have anthrax.

1101
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,100
For real, huh?

1102
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,100
No, I do not have anthrax, thank gosh.

1103
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
I do have an anthrax CD somewhere.

1104
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Did you start developing the rash, like, as soon as you started taking it?

1105
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
No, it was about five days into it.

1106
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Five days into it?

1107
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,100
Yeah.

1108
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,100
Of course you didn't have anthrax.

1109
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,100
It does suck.

1110
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,100
It does suck.

1111
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,100
But I've been to the doctor so much in the past two months, I couldn't go back over the rash.

1112
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,100
I was just like, you know what, I feel fine, I'm just not gonna take it.

1113
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,100
I have some drug stuff to talk to you about after the show, too, because I know drug stuff.

1114
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,100
Yay, drugs!

1115
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
Drugs are rad.

1116
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Yeah!

1117
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Alright.

1118
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
There's a new Pokemon game coming out.

1119
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,100
Yay.

1120
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,100
This is like the scene where they say, and they ate Robin's minstrels and there was much rejoicing,

1121
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,100
and they just go, yay.

1122
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Yay.

1123
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Yeah.

1124
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:54,100
Koto Koto magazine said out word that there's going to be Pokemon Platinum,

1125
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:01,100
and it's supposed to be a companion to Diamond and Pearl.

1126
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,100
So, yay.

1127
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,100
Pokemon, colors we haven't thought of yet.

1128
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,100
I still like my Pokemans, but I have a feeling this will be just emerald all over again.

1129
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,100
Pokemon's a good game.

1130
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:18,100
I don't know, Platinum sounds like, I don't know.

1131
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,100
I can't help but think of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

1132
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:31,100
I played Pokemon Pearl for a while, but I only played it at the gym while I was riding the recumbent bike.

1133
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:39,100
So, apparently the casting has, or some rumors about casting have come out about the Prince of Persia movie,

1134
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,100
and Jake Gyllenhaal is now reported to be the Prince of Persia.

1135
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,100
Wow, that's so Persian.

1136
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,100
I know, totally.

1137
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,100
Dude, Bubble Boy is the Prince of Persia, that's pretty awesome.

1138
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,100
Bubble Boy was on TV the other day.

1139
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,100
I've watched that way too many times.

1140
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,100
But, yeah, I don't know.

1141
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,100
I can't be too excited about this.

1142
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,100
He just looks too lethargic, I'm sorry.

1143
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:18,100
He's just very like, I have to act.

1144
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,100
As long as it's hot, like Brokeback Mountain, then we're fine.

1145
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,100
I can't quit you, Prince of Persia.

1146
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,100
Excuse me, a baking powder.

1147
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:32,100
Speaking of video game movies, $200 million.

1148
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:40,100
$200 million variety reports, Crystal Sky Pictures has signed this deal for $200 million financing,

1149
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:46,100
and what this millions of dollars is going to be used, it's going to fund Castlevania,

1150
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:52,100
a sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled, and Pac-Man, the movie.

1151
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:58,100
So they're making Stranglehold the game, the movie, and then the game, because it'll come back around again.

1152
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,100
What a horrible night to have a movie.

1153
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,100
Now, look, we know that Castlevania has been, like, this has been off and on with Rider Strike and everything.

1154
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:12,100
We know this was on the table, but seriously, Pac-Man, the movie, like, how in the hell is that going to work?

1155
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,100
I mean, Pac-Man did have a TV show.

1156
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,100
He's a trap act.

1157
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,100
It was a cartoon. I guess if Pac-Man's a cartoon, it might work.

1158
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,100
It's a dumb idea.

1159
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,100
He's a pill popper.

1160
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:26,100
It's a dumb idea, although we did throw around the premise of a Pac-Man movie.

1161
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:37,100
One man in the future will save the world from Inky, Binky, and Clyde using dots.

1162
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,100
Why are you talking like Triple H?

1163
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,100
No, they...

1164
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,100
It's the movie man.

1165
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:47,100
No, what you would do is you would have a cop on the edge, you know, played by...

1166
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,100
Oh, God, the guy...

1167
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,100
Joe Pesci.

1168
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,100
No, not Joe Pesci.

1169
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,100
No, that'd be funny, though, but...

1170
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,100
He knew too much.

1171
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,100
No, no.

1172
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Now the ghosts of his past are after him.

1173
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
Ah, Gerardimo wins.

1174
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,100
He says the Pac-Man movie will have Kylie Minogue as Ms. Pac-Man and it'll be awesome.

1175
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,100
That's a good point.

1176
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,100
Lame.

1177
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,100
Do not want...

1178
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:18,100
Do not want...

1179
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Dark Sakura, what could they possibly do a Pac-Man movie about?

1180
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,100
Have you ever seen the cartoon from the 80s?

1181
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,100
Is there anything?

1182
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,100
I think the cartoon from the 80s was great and there was Pac-Land.

1183
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,100
Unless there was only one feasible way I could see this happening, right?

1184
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,100
And it would not be a movie that they would be able to promote very well.

1185
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,100
Is if they did a Pac-Man porno where they dressed everybody up in ridiculous costumes and made them have sex.

1186
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
That's the only way this could work.

1187
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:46,100
It's scary, but it's the only feasible way this could possibly work.

1188
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Not sure if want.

1189
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:56,100
We reached out to Atari for comment on the Pac-Man movie and this is all they had to say.

1190
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,100
Too bad it's Namco that's going to be taking care of that.

1191
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,100
I...my theory...

1192
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,100
It's a joke from like three weeks ago.

1193
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,100
I know it is.

1194
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,100
That was for the fans.

1195
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
Wow.

1196
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,100
I miss the bus.

1197
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:12,100
I miss the bus, sorry.

1198
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,100
What?

1199
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,100
I feel it's going to be CG.

1200
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,100
Probably.

1201
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,100
Okay.

1202
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,100
I feel it's going to be poop.

1203
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,100
It's going to be a pooped out rubber band.

1204
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,100
You know what?

1205
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,100
You need to take that toilet paper joke book, turn it upside down.

1206
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,100
I'm not going to say it.

1207
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,100
You know, if...

1208
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,100
Turn it upside down and turn that smith front.

1209
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:45,100
SSJ100Matt says that Jessica Alba should be Mrs. Pac-Man, but that makes me think that all games, Jessica, if she doesn't get the role in that horror movie, she should make Ms. Pac-Man her next goal.

1210
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,100
Come on.

1211
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,100
I'm only recycling your material.

1212
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,100
Come on.

1213
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,100
If she doesn't win that, don't you think she's suffered enough?

1214
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,100
I don't know.

1215
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,100
All right.

1216
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,100
More news, please.

1217
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,100
Rob.

1218
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Can I have news?

1219
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,100
No, you can't.

1220
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,100
You can have...okay.

1221
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:12,100
Well, for people who give a shit, and I'm not one of them, Postal's coming to Blu-ray in August.

1222
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Postal is that movie made by...what's his name?

1223
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,100
Who did a bunch of shitty movies?

1224
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,100
Uwe Boll.

1225
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,100
Yeah, he sucks.

1226
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,100
Sadly enough, I have this preordered already.

1227
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,100
You do?

1228
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
Why are you putting money in his pocket?

1229
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,100
Loki just really wants to see Dave Foley's penis in high definition.

1230
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,100
Don't you know it?

1231
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Totally.

1232
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,100
No, actually, this movie looks so bad that I have to add it to my bad movie collection.

1233
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,100
Yeah, it does look pretty bad.

1234
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:52,100
To read the, I guess, synopsis of the movie, it's about a misfit who sets out to rob his local amusement park while getting mixed up with a faction of the Taliban.

1235
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
I'm sorry, what?

1236
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,100
Yeah.

1237
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,100
It grossed less than five million.

1238
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,100
Well, it's only in four theaters.

1239
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,100
It grossed less than five dollars.

1240
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,100
Which is a really nice way of saying that it made...

1241
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,100
How did it even make five million? Are you sure it's not five thousand?

1242
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:14,100
Well, first off, it just came out. I mean, literally this week, so...

1243
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,100
We wish it would go back.

1244
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:21,100
I don't know. I'd see it. But, see, because this looks actually semi-interesting to me.

1245
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:26,100
I've watched an Uwe Boll movie before, the BloodRayne 2 movie.

1246
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,100
Interesting premise. Execution was shit.

1247
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,100
Loki, you're part of the problem.

1248
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:37,100
Hey, I had to watch it in order to talk to Uwe Boll, okay? We interviewed him. That was fun.

1249
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,100
You're part of the reason he keeps making this shit.

1250
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,100
Hey, I didn't actually pay to see this movie. It was a screener.

1251
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,100
But, yeah, I get to talk to him. It was cool.

1252
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,100
He's making a game, too, by the way.

1253
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,100
It's Tunnel Rat.

1254
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,100
Hooray.

1255
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:01,100
No, it's about, like, these guys that are in Vietnam and they go into the vehicle.

1256
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,100
Oh, dude, Tunnel Rat was the name of the G.I. Joe.

1257
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:08,100
Yeah, probably named for the same reason, but, yeah.

1258
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,100
Talk about another movie that's gonna suck.

1259
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:16,100
I was trying to see how much Postal made over the weekend, but it's not even on the top ten. Surprise.

1260
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,100
I'm trying to think where we go to see that.

1261
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,100
I looked at Box Office Mojo. I couldn't find it.

1262
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,100
But I'm looking now for the Rotten Tomatoes score. Eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes for Postal.

1263
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,100
IMDB sometimes has the actual, like, disease.

1264
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,100
It has four screens. I mean, it can't do very- it's probably gonna do a million.

1265
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:40,100
I'm looking at- not even that. I'm looking at positive reviews for Postal. Let's see.

1266
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,100
Prairie Miller from News Blaze says,

1267
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:50,100
Along the way to its parking lot showdown, a wacky property damage conspiracy to commit insurance fraud is uncovered between Osama and Bush.

1268
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:56,100
The darker, zany recesses of America is viewed from the Twilight Zone. Move over, Barat.

1269
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,100
What?

1270
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,100
Let's see. Here's another positive review from Cam Williams.

1271
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:06,100
I suppose since almost seven years have passed since 9-11, America might finally be ready to laugh at the tragedy.

1272
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:10,100
Tasteless, profane, and far-fetched, but undeniably funny, too.

1273
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,100
Dot, dot, dot. That's all I have to say.

1274
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,100
Film Threat, Jeremy Knox.

1275
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:22,100
It's not perfect and will get on the nerves of the more opinionated critics out there, but it's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.

1276
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,100
Dot, dot, fucking dot.

1277
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Those are the three positive reviews, giving it an eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes right now.

1278
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,100
I do have to admit, the poster is pretty funny.

1279
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:36,100
I mean, it's offensive. It's highly offensive, but it's mildly amusing.

1280
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:46,100
Alright. So, some interesting news. We've been hearing a lot of different publishers dropping out of both E3 and the ESA.

1281
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:52,100
Well, there's another one dropping out of the ESA, and I think they're already out of E3, so it's not a big surprise there.

1282
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:57,100
But id Software has actually dropped out of the ESA as well.

1283
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:07,100
And they're joined, of course, with LucasArts, Activision, and Vividi. Or Activision Blizzard, which I still don't understand why they're still referring to them as two different companies.

1284
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,100
But, whatever.

1285
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:17,100
And it's unclear what their decision, why they decided to drop out of the ESA, but we do know that they're gone.

1286
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:23,100
So, apparently, one more out the door. Interesting.

1287
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,100
Any theories why this is happening, Logan?

1288
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:36,100
I don't know. Maybe they just don't feel like ESA is representing them enough, or maybe they're just getting cheap and they don't want to pay the money to the ESA to help defend them.

1289
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:42,100
And besides, I mean, think about it this way. It's like they're defending the game industry, okay?

1290
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,100
And anybody that's joined up with the ESA has to pay them to defend the game industry.

1291
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:51,100
Well, if you drop out of the ESA, they're still defending you, so it's like you're getting a free ride.

1292
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:56,100
Robin Chat says the ESA business seems to be the beginning of a new consortium.

1293
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,100
I don't know. It sounded pretty gay to me.

1294
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,100
Why did you say that?

1295
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,100
I mean, they're just freeloading on this shit.

1296
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:20,100
Well, that's just my opinion on why they're, I mean, it makes perfect business sense if, you know, okay, well, I can eliminate this cost and they're still doing the work for me, so, as unethical as it is, eh, whatever.

1297
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:26,100
Well, speaking of things that are pretty gay, Xbox Live has been going on a banning marathon lately.

1298
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,100
A couple of bannings recently have caught some attention.

1299
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:34,100
The Gayer Gamer was a gamertag that got banned recently.

1300
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:42,100
Also, this gamertag got banned. Richard Gaywood was a gamertag that got banned, and you might be thinking, ho ho ho, Gaywood.

1301
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,100
There's actually a street near here. It's Gaywood Street.

1302
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,100
Dick Gaywood.

1303
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,100
Here's the thing. His name is really Richard Gaywood.

1304
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,100
His parents apparently hate him.

1305
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,100
There's actually a scan of, no, that's the last name. You don't get to pick your last name.

1306
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,100
There's actually a scan of his driver's license up on the internet. His name was Richard Gaywood.

1307
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:07,100
Now, why you would want to use your name as your gamertag is beyond me, but granted, did Xbox overreact?

1308
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,100
Some gay themed websites chimed in on this.

1309
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:18,100
Lesbian Gamer said, I've taken a few deep breaths, run this story over in my mind again and again, and yet still return to the same annoying factor.

1310
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:25,100
Why does gay automatically equate to sex or of a sexual nature and carry with it such negative and deviant overtones?

1311
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:34,100
I can understand Microsoft is trying to protect users, but perhaps there needs to be some table debate as to what they're protecting whom from and what they're perpetuating in the process.

1312
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Linking gay to some negative or sexually explicit content merely fans the fires of homophobia.

1313
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Gay Gamer said this, I'm somewhat on the fence with the issue, having played many MMORPGs and seeing the many annoying and disturbing names that can come from the idle minds on the internets.

1314
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:52,100
And it seems as if Microsoft is putting up the normal, we can't make exceptions defense.

1315
01:00:52,100 --> 01:01:00,100
All of this, however, is greatly outweighed by the fact that it is given name, and despite the connotations it may carry with it, he lives with that name every day.

1316
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:06,100
And I'm sure you've probably been wondering what I, the gay host of Orange Laund Radio, have to say on this subject.

1317
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:14,100
And honestly, you want my honest opinion on this subject? We have much bigger things to worry about in life than this.

1318
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:23,100
For instance, they are going to try and overturn the recent gay marriage thing that was passed in the state of California by the Supreme Court.

1319
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,100
Finally have allowed gay marriage to happen in the state in less than 30 days.

1320
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,100
And the crazies are going to try and put it on the November ballot.

1321
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:36,100
And according to recent polls, 54% of Californians would vote for it to overturn gay marriage.

1322
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:42,100
Because, yeah, suddenly you're going to let gays marry and there's going to be like this just sudden fuckwave going through the state.

1323
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,100
And everybody's going to start fucking everywhere because that's what happens when you let gays get married.

1324
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,100
Next thing you know, cats marry dogs and up is down.

1325
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria. Stupid.

1326
01:01:54,100 --> 01:02:00,100
So, you know what I have to say? The hell with Xbox Live. It's their service. They can do whatever they want.

1327
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,100
I mean, yeah, it's a little asinine, but whatever.

1328
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,100
Rob, I have a question.

1329
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,100
We have more important things to worry about right now.

1330
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,100
Yes?

1331
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:13,100
If gay marriage is allowed, wouldn't that like lower the amount of gay sex that's happening?

1332
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,100
You know, because once you get married you stop having sex.

1333
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,100
Yeah, it really would.

1334
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,100
She has a point.

1335
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:23,100
So, you know, that would be good for the, you know, the right wing if, you know, gay marriage was allowed.

1336
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,100
Welcome to the Olive Garden Roundtable.

1337
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:32,100
That and there would be a lot more economic growth for all of the gay men registering.

1338
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:39,100
I loved what Ellen said. I'm sorry to get political on this show, but for obvious reasons this is something I feel very, very strongly in.

1339
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,100
It won't be the last time I say something about it. It's a deal.

1340
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,100
Okay.

1341
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,100
Do you see any of this protesting?

1342
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,100
No, I know. I know.

1343
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:50,100
But I love what Ellen said to John McCain is that she said something about, she compared it to, and it's really like this,

1344
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:56,100
is that you say there's two chairs over there and you can sit in one but you can't sit in the other.

1345
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,100
Why not? You just can't.

1346
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,100
That's what it feels like. Think about it.

1347
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,100
All right.

1348
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,100
That's it. I am against chair marriage as well.

1349
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,100
That's just wrong.

1350
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,100
What will you do without you?

1351
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:19,100
I honestly, I think that the best, one of the best, and I'm sure a lot of people know by now I'm a big fan of the show Bullshit.

1352
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:24,100
Watch the episode about gay marriage and polyamory. Seriously.

1353
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:29,100
Thank God for the youth of America because I seriously think I'm probably preaching to the choir, most people of this show.

1354
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,100
I mean I know we have tons and tons of heterosexual people that listen to this show that probably listen to this and go,

1355
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,100
what's the big freaking deal?

1356
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,100
That's what we're saying. That's all we're saying. What's the big freaking deal?

1357
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,100
Because people have the religious corn cob up their ass.

1358
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,100
That's a lot less comfortable than other things to be up their ass for.

1359
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:51,100
I'll tell you what, there's a million other things we're going to hell for before gay marriage, I'll tell you that.

1360
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,100
Anyhow, moving on.

1361
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,100
People are stupid.

1362
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,100
Please get me off my political tangent.

1363
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,100
I'll take the soapbox out from under you.

1364
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:06,100
Well how about we speak of our common nemesis that we have with the rest of the video game community.

1365
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,100
Now everyone can agree, no matter what, everyone can agree.

1366
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,100
He who shall not be named.

1367
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,100
That this guy's a moron.

1368
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,100
I'm going to say his name so that I can read this headline, which is wonderful.

1369
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:25,100
Jack Thompson, guilty man, 27 of 31 misconduct charges recommended by judge.

1370
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:29,100
There's a lovely picture under this on the distorted article.

1371
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,100
He said his name.

1372
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:35,100
This is karma, you dump it, you drink it.

1373
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,100
Lovely.

1374
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:47,100
Yeah, so basically dude is on, dude's guilty for fucking up.

1375
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,100
Did Jack Thompson jump up and go, objection.

1376
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,100
No, because he's not that.

1377
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,100
Overruled, bitch.

1378
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:59,100
I, the day that he is completely, what's the word, disbarred.

1379
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:05,100
I am going to, what's something awesome.

1380
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:10,100
Dude, when Jack Thompson is disbarred, I might dress up as Tingle.

1381
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,100
Do it.

1382
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,100
Shit.

1383
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,100
He just said he might.

1384
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:19,100
No, they're having the results of the disbarring trial on June 4th.

1385
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,100
So it is, you know, like, I didn't say I would, I said I might.

1386
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,100
Yes, you did.

1387
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,100
You said you would.

1388
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,100
I said I might.

1389
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,100
No takes.

1390
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,100
It says might.

1391
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,100
What did this June 4th fall on?

1392
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,100
We will be live on Wednesday.

1393
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,100
No, I'm kidding.

1394
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,100
If they let us.

1395
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,100
We will record live.

1396
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,100
Where would I get a Tingle outfit?

1397
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,100
Where would I even get that?

1398
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,100
We will make.

1399
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,100
Okay.

1400
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,100
You know what?

1401
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,100
What?

1402
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,100
You'll bring back Dr. Dick.

1403
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,100
We'll see.

1404
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,100
And, or Mr. Spanky.

1405
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:56,100
There will be celebration of some sort happening when, when Lord Voldemort is disbarred.

1406
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:02,100
I think that's, and on top of that, we need to send a letter to Ice Cube.

1407
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,100
Wiki this, please.

1408
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,100
Why?

1409
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,100
No, it wasn't Ice Cube.

1410
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,100
It was Ice T.

1411
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,100
Why?

1412
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:12,100
Because, um, Fuckhead got him back in the, um, nineties for his album.

1413
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,100
Remember?

1414
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,100
Oh, yes.

1415
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,100
Because his big thing was music.

1416
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,100
And then he moved from music to video games.

1417
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:22,100
All this guy wants is to have the world lick his ass, not kiss it, lick it.

1418
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Licking is far more disgusting.

1419
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,100
All right.

1420
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,100
We're going to be opening up the Skypline very soon.

1421
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,100
Let's pay Politary to do that.

1422
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,100
Well, it sounds just like you're singing.

1423
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,100
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1424
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:43,100
But first, one more story that's not about Lord Voldemort or Tingle dressing.

1425
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,100
Yes.

1426
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,100
And this is not a bad story, actually.

1427
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:52,100
Um, there's going to be some Japanese songs that may be hitting rock band very soon, actually.

1428
01:06:52,100 --> 01:07:02,100
Um, apparently, um, a harmonics developer, uh, told Joystick during a rock band's party in New York City,

1429
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:07,100
um, that they will be seeing some Japanese rock music in the games.

1430
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:13,100
Um, apparently they were supposed to be, there should be an announcement coming soon, but who knows?

1431
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,100
Maybe, uh, some stuff like TM Revolution, uh, Malice Miser.

1432
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,100
What would you like to see?

1433
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,100
The Pillows?

1434
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,100
Guitar Wolf.

1435
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,100
Malice Miser's so old.

1436
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,100
What's her name?

1437
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,100
The crazy chick.

1438
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Kana?

1439
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,100
Kana?

1440
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
Yeah.

1441
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,100
I don't know that she's doing anything anymore.

1442
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,100
That's too bad.

1443
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,100
Kana's crazy, though.

1444
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,100
Guitar Wolf.

1445
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,100
They need Guitar Wolf.

1446
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,100
Bees.

1447
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,100
But...

1448
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
But Bass Wolf is dead.

1449
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,100
Did they replace...?

1450
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Gacked.

1451
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,100
Gacked.

1452
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,100
Maybe.

1453
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,100
Bees.

1454
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,100
Definitely.

1455
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
There you go.

1456
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,100
Here...

1457
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,100
Yeah, they'd probably have Smop or something.

1458
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,100
Listen.

1459
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,100
This is what Activision needs to do, okay?

1460
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,100
If you want to make an actual game that's going to be something that stands out from

1461
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,980
all these other music games out there, you make the official Guitar Wolf game.

1462
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:55,100
You have it be an action game with music playing in there as well.

1463
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,100
Zombies.

1464
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,100
With zombies.

1465
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,100
And you fight zombies with your, uh, awesome guitar skills.

1466
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,100
Ooh!

1467
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,100
This is a good game here.

1468
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,100
So you would fight zombies with your guitar and you're a Japanese rock star.

1469
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,660
It'd probably, though, have, um, like, um...

1470
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,740
That's almost like Revolution X, but cooler.

1471
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,020
So I don't really...

1472
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,020
Dream games make it so.

1473
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,020
No, I don't know.

1474
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,020
No, we already had a dream game tonight.

1475
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,860
There's a few, um, I guess more, I would say obscure rock bands that I wouldn't mind hearing

1476
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:18,860
there.

1477
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:19,860
Like O'Miele's, uh...

1478
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,420
They're going to have, uh, Brutal Legend.

1479
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,660
That one with Jack Blackday is going to be, uh, Roadie.

1480
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:27,380
They fight, you know, zombies and, like, all sorts of, like, uh, bumping chicken.

1481
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,380
I still have your copy of Wild Zero.

1482
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,680
I was wondering where that was.

1483
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
It's in my house.

1484
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
Oh, okay.

1485
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,680
All right, we're going to open up the Skypline.

1486
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,020
1-8-7-7 GAMEOLR.

1487
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,380
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1488
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,900
We only have time for a couple calls tonight, so we're going to try to keep this short and

1489
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:44,900
keep the calls short, too.

1490
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,900
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1491
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:46,900
Who's this?

1492
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,900
Hey, hey, hey.

1493
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,140
It's now level 30 DJ Rama S. It's not Zaku.

1494
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,900
Why level 30 Rama S?

1495
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,260
I just surveyed my big level 30 this past weekend, and I am sober.

1496
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,260
Congrats.

1497
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,260
Whoa.

1498
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,260
Oh, you're having the same birthday that I'm having next month.

1499
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,420
Oh, yeah.

1500
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,380
Well, congrats to you.

1501
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,500
Congrats on your ding, man.

1502
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Thank you.

1503
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,740
What else is on your mind besides that you're old?

1504
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,340
Um, I finally got my Xbox 360.

1505
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,060
Ooh, what'd you think?

1506
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:22,060
I kind of wish I'd gotten it sooner, but I'm pretty happy with it, and I have to thank

1507
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,380
Loki because he's been randy about Saints Row and Crackdown.

1508
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,660
I actually picked them up.

1509
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,660
Nice.

1510
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,340
They're like dirt cheap now, so.

1511
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,100
Yeah, and I'm enjoying it.

1512
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,260
Crackdown is really, Crackdown is a great game.

1513
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,700
What made you finally, what finally broke you into getting an Xbox 360?

1514
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,060
What was it that finally made you go, yes, I need this?

1515
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:46,980
Because we already have a Wii in the house, and what's left is the PS3 and the Xbox 360.

1516
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,580
And there's one thing that the Xbox 360 has that the PS3 does not.

1517
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,020
Which is?

1518
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,100
Games that I'd actually play.

1519
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,460
There you have it.

1520
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,300
So what other games did you get besides the two that Loki had recommended?

1521
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,820
Finally we went out and got Rock Band.

1522
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,580
Of course, nice.

1523
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,740
I picked up a copy of Rumble Roses XX.

1524
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,220
Nice.

1525
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,900
And we have Bioshock, oh my god, that game is awesome.

1526
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,900
It is very awesome.

1527
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,100
Do you have an HDTV to play all this on?

1528
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,100
32 inch.

1529
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,100
Very sexy.

1530
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,820
Oh yeah.

1531
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,820
Very sexy.

1532
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,180
So we'll have to jam on Rock Band sometime, add me to your friends list.

1533
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,180
I think I have room, I may not, I don't know.

1534
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:32,340
I hope so, because I will go check it, and I did download Yaris while y'all was on break.

1535
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,220
Wow, what'd you think?

1536
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,340
I haven't played it yet, but this is the way I look at it.

1537
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,660
Free game is free.

1538
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,500
Free game is free, but free game is also a bit of a waste of time.

1539
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,500
What are you laughing at?

1540
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
I'm sorry.

1541
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,700
DarkSocker is being very distracting tonight, because she's laughing at something.

1542
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:51,020
She's showing us this YouTube video of a flying penis.

1543
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,380
I saw that, that was funny.

1544
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,700
Remember the penis age in Second Life?

1545
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,700
This is real life.

1546
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:01,300
That is so stupid, and you guys are like, laughing.

1547
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,300
How old are you?

1548
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,300
How old are you?

1549
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,300
Five?

1550
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,300
Six?

1551
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,300
It has to do with gaming.

1552
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,300
Alright, anyhow.

1553
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,940
Is it a chess champion speech?

1554
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,060
I thought it was, yeah, they had that on Best Week Ever.

1555
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,060
I'm sorry, Rama, for that.

1556
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,780
Is there anything else you wanted to share besides the flying penis copter, as Act-Def

1557
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,780
calls it?

1558
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,780
No comment.

1559
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,780
Alright, take care, Rama.

1560
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,780
Alright, bye.

1561
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,780
Alright, bye.

1562
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,780
Bye.

1563
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:30,340
Stop distracting the show with your flying penises.

1564
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,940
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

1565
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:33,940
But it's clock.

1566
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:34,940
It's GS68.

1567
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,940
GS68, what is on your mind, my friend?

1568
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,940
Do you have a flying penis?

1569
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,940
Are you a fan of me right now?

1570
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,940
Yep.

1571
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,100
Wait, hey, you gotta get some noise.

1572
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,940
Are you in the middle of a crowd or something?

1573
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:54,220
Actually, no, I'm in the main area.

1574
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:55,220
You're in the main area?

1575
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,180
Are there tons of people walking through there?

1576
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,660
Over by the hall with the meeting rooms.

1577
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,900
Dude, make a beeline to the vendor hall and make some noise for Orange Lawn's radio.

1578
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,900
Yeah, you gotta make some noise for Orange Lawn's radio.

1579
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,900
Alright, that's alright.

1580
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,100
What, what, how's it going this year?

1581
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,100
That was fun to me.

1582
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,100
What are we missing out on?

1583
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,100
Let's see.

1584
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:23,340
This is the gaming room and dealer's room, for better or for worse, and dealer's room,

1585
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:28,140
they have maximum two and three, for example, but it's $1.50 a game instead of $1.

1586
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:38,340
They have the, pretty much the same Bamaari from last year, they still, they have Pops

1587
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:42,260
and there's going to be Fever, but they made it Adam L2 instead, which is awesome.

1588
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:46,220
Have there been any, any awesome panels this year to make up for the loss of Orange Lawn's

1589
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,220
radio?

1590
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:55,500
There's Bonzi Arcade, which is basically a game show where, also before, where you have

1591
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:01,260
like video game children, sometimes you're challenged to like, do a third test in a video

1592
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:06,340
game, like collect 25 rings and fight the hedgehog or beat the final boss of Sonic 2.

1593
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,340
Huh.

1594
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,340
Interesting.

1595
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,660
It sounds like you're having fun.

1596
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,980
What are some of the craziest cosplays you've seen while you've been there?

1597
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:26,420
Let me see, let me think, um, there, there's one mecha cosplay, I forgot the name, but

1598
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:30,980
he has some lights on his, I would say that was pretty cool.

1599
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:31,980
Hmm.

1600
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:32,980
Sounds good.

1601
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:37,180
I went to the hand-tack room for the heck of it.

1602
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:42,860
It was hilarious, like, like, like you're doing, I was doing like hand-tack and stuff

1603
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:51,260
like that, and people were like, and the freaking stuff they were showing.

1604
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,260
Huh.

1605
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,380
Well it sounds like you're having fun and you're going to continue to throughout the

1606
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,420
rest of the weekend, so I'm sorry we didn't make it this year, but are there any OLR listeners

1607
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,420
that you've run into?

1608
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:06,860
Unfortunately, I appear to be the only one that I know of.

1609
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,940
Aw, sadness.

1610
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,220
Some of the staff listens to our show, I know they do.

1611
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,220
Yeah.

1612
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,220
They're all closet fans.

1613
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,220
Yeah.

1614
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:23,100
So, so on my DS, like, I sent my nickname to O-R-M-E-G-S-68, I went into the world with

1615
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:29,620
use Mingle Mode and just walked around to that way, so people pass my DS, so when other

1616
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:35,220
people in Mingle Mode pass by my DS, they'll see my name and, yeah.

1617
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:38,620
I like the grassroots effort to get the OLR name out there.

1618
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,620
Very well done.

1619
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,620
Yeah.

1620
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:47,620
I had a little OLR circle flash logo, right?

1621
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,620
Yeah?

1622
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:55,500
Yeah, I think first thing I had it in my badge holder, because I had an oversized badge holder,

1623
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,420
like it's big enough to carry a little card under my badge.

1624
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,740
Oh, very cool.

1625
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:05,300
We should make, we should make little somethings for people that go to anime conventions.

1626
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,140
Ooh, I should look into that, like little stickers or something that people can wear.

1627
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,860
I thought I could check out the anime master last night, I didn't really like it.

1628
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:19,300
Like, a lot of, like a lot of kids, they try too hard with the voice acting, so it's a

1629
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,800
sounding cheated horror wonder to really dance kit, like, too many people doing that freaking

1630
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,300
Haru Haru Yagai dance, I mean...

1631
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,300
It's still good.

1632
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,300
I suppose.

1633
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:37,920
But they're pretty awesome more versus Capcom skit, where they, where they were the...

1634
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:44,460
I think Ryou's Shinkou had broken a character, like they replicated that with like a, well,

1635
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,860
a cellophane, which was pretty awesome.

1636
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,060
It looked like a laser, I guess.

1637
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,060
Huh.

1638
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,820
Well, it sounds like you're having a real good time at Fonome, so keep spreading the

1639
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:00,420
word and let us know, expect a full, full report next week.

1640
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:05,280
Also, we want to let you know, a good friend of OLR, Mel, he is apparently, Mel B is apparently

1641
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,260
deejaying something on Sunday at 10 o'clock, so I don't know how long you're going to be

1642
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,260
there.

1643
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,260
Excuse me?

1644
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,580
Apparently Mel B is deejaying something tonight, in an hour, at 10 o'clock.

1645
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:14,580
He's deejaying something.

1646
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,900
There must be some type of dance or something going on.

1647
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,900
Me too.

1648
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,900
Mel B, our buddy.

1649
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,980
Oh, Mel B, um, I don't really know him.

1650
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,780
Oh, well tell, he knows OLR.

1651
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,780
Oh, I see.

1652
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,780
All right.

1653
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,180
We gotta let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but have fun.

1654
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,180
All right, bye.

1655
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,180
Run around, act crazy.

1656
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,180
All right, see you around.

1657
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,180
All right.

1658
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,180
Take care.

1659
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,180
See you around.

1660
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,180
Thank you.

1661
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,180
Thanks, buddy.

1662
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,180
All right, so we just got a call direct from Phonome.

1663
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,180
It's kind of cool.

1664
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,580
I like these a whole little, like, live reports we're getting.

1665
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,980
Uh, hi, you're on Orange Honors Radio.

1666
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,980
Who's this?

1667
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,580
Hi, this is SSJ100 Matt.

1668
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:52,240
Well, hello, SSJ100 Matt, the, um, winner of the OLR, uh, contest from a couple weeks

1669
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:57,420
ago for the, uh, GTA IV console, and we heard that you got at least one vote from another

1670
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,420
show, so that's good.

1671
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,420
I'm, I know.

1672
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,420
It's awesome.

1673
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,420
Things are looking good.

1674
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,420
So, what's up, buddy?

1675
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,420
Nothing much.

1676
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,900
that much well you know i just want to call in uh... but i want to thank

1677
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,640
everyone who are voted uh... voted on my uh...

1678
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,980
entry that would be everyone has to see one of us

1679
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,460
yeah you

1680
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,180
you are going to kick but not competition you did a great job

1681
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,880
well you know i felt guilty cuz i know you guys call but i was i was on the

1682
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,340
road i was on a car cross-country trips uh... it had we edited out of the

1683
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,660
podcast they'll never know

1684
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,940
yeah

1685
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:34,380
but i just want to thank everyone and uh... it felt like uh... you'd be all

1686
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,860
games people like that and started uh...

1687
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,240
very young and just go like that yes in the end they didn't vote for you but i

1688
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,540
think it's because they didn't get it

1689
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:47,160
so i think that that's uh... unfortunately the nancy body body gets

1690
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,260
it is he's listen to the show for a long time just like we've listened him for a

1691
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,100

1742
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:30,940
dance uh... we are you dressed up as someone

1743
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,080
uh...

1744
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,660
one of them are supposed to be each ago but i think it's a full outfit so i'm

1745
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,900
just exposed to have a school uniform

1746
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,260
uh...

1747
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:43,060
that another one of the next my friend who he was coupling tension and i'm

1748
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,060
supposed to be a

1749
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:47,400
killing from the melancholy of her he says to me

1750
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,060
i'm trying to figure out if this is you

1751
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,140
we're trying to look at the pictures here oh yeah that looks like orange here

1752
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,660
that's probably right there

1753
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,660
very cool

1754
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:03,340
though sounds like you have always are just like tons and tons of people there

1755
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,180
or yeah i think that like that

1756
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:08,320
fourth biggest convention in the united states or something like that that is an

1757
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,580
awesome pyramid head out there with that

1758
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,540
let's get here and a cosplay out of here with us in my head to the pictures

1759
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,580
earlier uh...

1760
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,620
very hot

1761
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,480
uh... so i think what at what do you really did things to see their real

1762
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,600
quick

1763
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,260
uh... well i don't really get the play much because there is like huge lines

1764
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,980
for all the games

1765
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,980
but me of course with a huge station with all you play classic fighters like

1766
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,740
street fighter and just like

1767
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:35,000
goes on and on and then there's like brawl of course

1768
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,340
uh...

1769
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,960
correct your case that they had like

1770
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,160
beat mania

1771
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,540
six-part and

1772
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,760
and then they have

1773
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,000
the new one

1774
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,620
gold

1775
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,220
and i really get to play that because

1776
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:50,260
i was wrong with the six max fishing i put in my quarters and they like ripped me off

1777
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,440
i was just like dang it

1778
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,660
they had an in the group two machine

1779
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:00,080
i think it had r twenty one or something because

1780
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,540
it had this whole opening preview video that over four thousand five hundred

1781
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,540
songs i'm just like holy shit and somebody probably installed

1782
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,000
a hack on it

1783
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
something but oh my god it was huge and then they had ddr extreme pump it up

1784
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,960
