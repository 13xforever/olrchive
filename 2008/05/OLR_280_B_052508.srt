[SPEAKER_02]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:39,873
[SPEAKER_13]: 3-day weekends in OLR world usually mean that we're going to get drunk for Sunday nights, but not this year.

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,094
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of a downer.

7
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:43,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

8
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:46,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Loki had to drive here, and of course you're not going to drink and drive.

9
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:46,815
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not okay.

10
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:51,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And DarkSakura, she's entertaining company, so she doesn't want to be passed out while company is here.

11
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:57,059
[SPEAKER_13]: And me, I'm not allowed to drink medically right now because of everything I have with my pancreas.

12
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I might have to stay away from alcohol for a long time.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,960
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's okay.

14
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,163
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't need alcohol.

15
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:07,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Alcohol's fun when done responsibly, but you don't need it.

16
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,148
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Olive.

17
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:14,394
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do need Olive Garden, so I hope I can eat something besides vegetables again soon.

18
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:15,616
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

19
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:18,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Those of you playing the drinking game at home, take a shot.

20
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:18,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

21
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:20,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do they take a shot?

22
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Olive Garden.

23
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:22,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

24
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:29,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, we're going to get back into the gaming news here on Part B. If you missed Part A, you should go back in the podcast feed and listen to it.

25
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:35,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless you're listening live on Sunday, then unless you can rewind time, you're just going to have to wait for Part A to hit the podcast feed, which should happen soon.

26
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:39,110
[SPEAKER_13]: But in the meantime, Wii News, Loki.

27
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we didn't get this game over here.

28
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:47,573
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a music game in Japan that translated to Band Brothers.

29
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:57,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Also in Japan, they will be getting a brand new sequel to that game, which is entitled Band Brothers DX.

30
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:06,218
[SPEAKER_11]: It will allow players to stream their best performances to their Wii for output through TV speakers, stereos, and home theater systems.

31
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:07,779
[SPEAKER_11]: To accompany this,

32
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:18,403
[SPEAKER_11]: We are getting a new channel called The Speaker Channel, which will allow you to do such things as that.

33
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:20,343
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty interesting.

34
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:27,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I guess the Band Brothers game, the original one, is due out for the U.S.

35
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:29,366
[SPEAKER_11]: as well, called Jam with the Band.

36
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:34,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least it was, but now I don't know if that's still coming out.

37
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:36,749
[SPEAKER_13]: What if I don't want Jam with the Band?

38
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,257
[SPEAKER_11]: What if I want to dance with myself?

39
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:41,478
[SPEAKER_13]: But thou must.

40
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:43,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

41
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it looks neat, I guess.

42
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,001
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds interesting.

43
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think it's something we might ever get here in the States?

44
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.

45
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:54,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo likes releasing stuff here.

46
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,217
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

47
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Drive had a game in Japan only.

48
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,331
[SPEAKER_13]: It was called Glaylancer.

49
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:17,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Not gray, that's glay.

50
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:18,773
[SPEAKER_13]: G-L-E-Y.

51
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:22,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Glaylancer came out, and that's supposedly going to be coming out here soon.

52
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:28,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami had a game on the NES called Biomiracle Bakute Uppa.

53
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:29,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say yay!

54
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:57,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you were?

55
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were going to complain that it wasn't Shinobi World.

57
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:03,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say yay and then complain it wasn't Shinobi World.

58
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:04,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, sorry.

59
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:04,783
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

60
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:05,864
[SPEAKER_09]: God, Rob.

61
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:10,066
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can play... What's that game?

62
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,166
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not Rock Paper Scissors.

63
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:12,407
[SPEAKER_13]: What do they call it in Alex Kidd?

64
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Jankenpon.

65
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:14,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Jankenpon.

66
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:18,450
[SPEAKER_13]: You can play that to your heart's content in Alex Kidd Miracle World.

67
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Coming soon.

68
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:21,672
[SPEAKER_13]: But now more news.

69
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:24,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Product Placement Done Wrong

70
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:51,389
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this huge, massive Wii Fit, you know, humongoid thing.

71
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's right over Chevy's in Times Square.

72
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,472
[SPEAKER_12]: But isn't it healthy because it's like fresh mix and stuff?

73
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:02,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's fresh mix.

74
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:06,994
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have a big fucking burrito and a big fucking margarita as big as your head.

75
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exactly what I said earlier.

76
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And you could be healthy because you'll go home to Wii Fit.

77
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:15,284
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't care because you'll go home drunk and off.

78
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Ain't it grand?

79
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:20,125
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as I have a salad and bottomless chips and salsa, I'll be fine, right?

80
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:20,745
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

81
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,725
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a salad, Jamie.

82
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:23,905
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have to tell my Chevy story.

83
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:26,046
[SPEAKER_13]: With avocado and sour cream, I'll be fine, right?

84
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:26,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Sour cream.

85
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio is nowhere sponsored by Chevys.

86
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a Chevy story, though.

87
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:32,407
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, real quick.

88
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Since we are Orange Lounge Foodio.

89
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:36,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I ordered a margarita.

90
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:37,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a prickly pear margarita.

91
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And I ordered a small one so you know it was massive.

92
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And they spilled a third of it.

93
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:43,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, so I had to give you another one.

94
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:44,448
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

95
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:44,928
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

96
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,170
[SPEAKER_09]: They refilled that third with tequila.

97
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:58,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm eating my seafood fajitas, which is probably the thing I get every time I go there, drinking down this hefty, and you know me and tequila on top of that.

98
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,798
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, let's just, you know, it's like Drew said earlier, waffles.

99
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Waffles, waffles, waffles

100
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:24,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, A, I just saw Guardian Legend on my TV, so I got distracted for a minute.

101
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Shiny.

102
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:28,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's playing with all these things you shouldn't be on the Wii right now.

103
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:28,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

104
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:30,955
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very distracting.

105
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:36,218
[SPEAKER_09]: From here on, I'm going to associate Wii Fit with Chevys and therefore margaritas, so whenever I think of Wii Fit, I'll get drunk.

106
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:36,959
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what, though.

107
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the product placement is working.

108
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, maybe not this particular case, but you can't find Wii Fit anywhere right now.

109
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:43,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed launch day.

110
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:47,965
[SPEAKER_13]: I slept through it or whatever, and I didn't get the game when it came out, and I'll never get it now.

111
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, Loki?

112
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:49,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

113
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:50,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

114
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:55,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in short supply right now because those Wii Balance boards are fucking hard to manufacture.

115
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:04,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in GameStop in Las Vegas a few days ago, one of the most obese cities in the nation, and there were like 75 Wii Fit boards.

116
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:07,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sitting there, it was like they couldn't get rid of them.

117
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:07,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it!

118
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:08,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Please take these!

119
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it, I'm shopping in the wrong place.

120
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Because people are like, money?

121
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to gamble that away.

122
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:17,347
[SPEAKER_13]: See, Kikoman2DX in chat says Wii Fit is in Costco.

123
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,688
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just at Costco today, and no it wasn't.

124
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:20,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I looked.

125
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:23,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, maybe in your neck of the woods, but not mine, sadly.

126
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:31,391
[SPEAKER_12]: In regards to Wii Fit, just a little reference to the hardcore old school computer nerds out there.

127
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Two words spring to mind.

128
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Guru meditation.

129
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Imagine that on the Wii Fit board.

130
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:37,473
[SPEAKER_12]: How about dance aerobics?

131
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:40,999
[SPEAKER_13]: That's old school for you.

132
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Aerobics.

133
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember that game on the NES for the power pad?

134
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Dance Aerobics was hardcore.

135
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:50,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't they have something like that coming out in Japan from Namco?

136
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,166
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a little power pad thing.

137
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, they could do it with real music now, too.

138
00:07:54,648 --> 00:08:01,272
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't need those crappy little... Well, not that NES music was crappy, because it wasn't, but they could actually have real songs in it and stuff.

139
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:02,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I could work out to Britney Spears.

140
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:03,314
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be fun.

141
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it would be fun.

142
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,340
[SPEAKER_13]: For a minute.

143
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:09,982
[SPEAKER_11]: For a minute?

144
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:26,896
[SPEAKER_11]: This game may not be Wii Fit and it certainly is not Dance Aerobics but coming to WiiWare soon is a game that is probably just as important and that would be the official beer pong game.

145
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:29,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Just what I needed!

146
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,254
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

147
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:18,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you be playing beer pong?

148
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Frat party games in preparation for being 21?

149
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,692
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no point!

150
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:38,585
[SPEAKER_11]: So no word on when it's going to come out or how much it's going to be, but I can tell you right now Or how drunk you won't get playing it Yeah, how drunk you won't get I feel totally wasted right now

151
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:39,612
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

152
00:09:55,692 --> 00:10:00,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Spinal and Orchid and Glacius.

153
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:00,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that his name?

154
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Combo Breaker.

155
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Combo Breaker and all those characters that were in Killer Instinct.

156
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll be damned if this rumor doesn't come up once a year.

157
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:10,367
[SPEAKER_13]: It's back.

158
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:13,570
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's thanks to EGM and the Quarterman.

159
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,192
[SPEAKER_13]: He always has us call him an EGM.

160
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently...

161
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:21,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Rare is going to be making a third entry in the Killer Instinct franchise.

162
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, Rare's denied this before, but apparently there is a game in the works.

163
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:29,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Killer Instinct 3D, Death, Destruction, and Doom.

164
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Get it?

165
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,111
[SPEAKER_13]: 3Ds.

166
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Death, Destruction, and Doom.

167
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,475
[SPEAKER_13]: It's apparently on the Xbox 360.

168
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Will she still have the boob attack?

169
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:36,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope so.

170
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:37,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, please.

171
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:43,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, though, it will not be using the pre-rendered stuff that was seen in the previous games, which is kind of a bummer.

172
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:48,986
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll just be 3D visuals and more robust gameplay, whatever that means.

173
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:50,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Bigger bus!

174
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:51,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

175
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:52,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Bigger bus!

176
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Maya had some pretty big busts.

177
00:10:56,571 --> 00:11:00,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you saw that, but that was a combo breaker of a different kind.

178
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,615
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be more mobust replay.

179
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:03,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

180
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:04,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultra combo me any day.

181
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

182
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:13,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Take with a giant grain of salt, but I don't think any of us would complain if this were true.

183
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:15,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

184
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:16,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I wouldn't.

185
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:22,239
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what they should do when there's a game that's being announced that everyone's been rumoring for it to come out for a long time?

186
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,501
[SPEAKER_11]: They should send everybody in the press a giant grain of salt.

187
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:27,403
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be hilarious.

188
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:28,823
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fun.

189
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:29,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Good idea.

190
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:30,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a moment.

191
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:31,685
[SPEAKER_09]: My browser just died.

192
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-oh.

193
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:34,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can't get to the next story now?

194
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,321
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm all over it.

195
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:37,702
[SPEAKER_13]: What are we going to do?

196
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:41,104
[SPEAKER_13]: The show is collapsed.

197
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:44,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Quickly then, some more discussion.

198
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Things you would most want to see in Killer Instinct 3.

199
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:49,751
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think Killer Instinct 3 needs more than anything?

200
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:50,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Jumblies.

201
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:52,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Banjo-Kazooie.

202
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:54,355
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it does not.

203
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:54,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's up.

204
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:06,706
[SPEAKER_09]: There are supposed to be new colors for the DS in Europe if anyone gives half a crap.

205
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Puke green, according to Tiara.

206
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:19,030
[SPEAKER_09]: There is... I like how the article said slime green.

207
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,550
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually lime green.

208
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Hot red and ice blue.

209
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:26,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's supposed to have dates of June 13th.

210
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:32,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Hot Red, Ice Blue, Lime Green, American Gladiators

211
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:50,312
[SPEAKER_13]: One of those shows that's so bad, it's good.

212
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,593
[SPEAKER_13]: I watch American Gladiators every week.

213
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:53,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Good times.

214
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:54,493
[SPEAKER_09]: You would.

215
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,194
[SPEAKER_13]: I love American Gladiators.

216
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:57,355
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great.

217
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:58,655
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope they make a new game.

218
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:03,177
[SPEAKER_13]: All I have to say is that in the previews, Atlas Sphere is coming back this year.

219
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:04,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank God.

220
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:04,797
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way.

221
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:05,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank God.

222
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:05,738
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

223
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,798
[SPEAKER_08]: My man won.

224
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:08,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I am pleased.

225
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,679
[SPEAKER_13]: The old American Gladiators season one?

226
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,420
[SPEAKER_08]: No, American Idol.

227
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, American Idol.

228
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,380
[SPEAKER_13]: American Idol.

229
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,251
[SPEAKER_13]: David Archuleta's dad would have an aneurysm.

230
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we really having American Idol talk on the show right now?

231
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:29,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not having this discussion.

232
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm done.

233
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:31,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Next topic!

234
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:36,525
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, something I've been distracted by lately.

235
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,847
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii Homebrew channel has been released.

236
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:50,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they've gotten it so bad now to where they can inject their own channels into the Wii, and it's just insane the amount of stuff that you can do now.

237
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Emulators, games...

238
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:58,072
[SPEAKER_11]: You name it, it's available and hopefully I'll be demonstrating it a little bit later.

239
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:59,253
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, it is available now.

240
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:05,115
[SPEAKER_11]: You can install it using the Twilight hack, which is actually pretty interesting the way it works.

241
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,915
[SPEAKER_11]: But pretty simple to do.

242
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,676
[SPEAKER_11]: There's instructions all over the internet.

243
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:15,739
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to get your homebrew on while it works, feel free to check your local...

244
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,460
[SPEAKER_11]: We Hacking Community Forums and you should be able to find it.

245
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we reached out to Nintendo for some comment on what they were going to do about this situation and what they had to say about this whole thing.

246
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:36,525
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all they had to say.

247
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,686
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all they had to say.

248
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,247
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because we can't drop E and rave.

249
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,847
[SPEAKER_12]: and Hump, The Coin Return of a Pot of Pot of Machine.

250
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,649
[SPEAKER_11]: They do have a bunch of stuff out for it right now.

251
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,450
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get ScumVM for it.

252
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,952
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually have a Tetris game that's someone's program.

253
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:53,853
[SPEAKER_11]: There's emulators for practically everything.

254
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:58,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo 64, TurboGrafx, Game Boy Color games, NES, Super NES.

255
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:03,701
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a region-free player for GameCube games.

256
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,543
[SPEAKER_11]: You can build that in there.

257
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,206
[SPEAKER_11]: They've also got... You can upload Mii's to it.

258
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:11,927
[SPEAKER_11]: You can...

259
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:14,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Guardian Legend

260
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:31,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think this is something they'll block in a future patch?

261
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't this be very easy to close the hole in it?

262
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,051
[SPEAKER_11]: They may be able to, but it's going to be pretty hard.

263
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:40,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is this going to be like the PSP where it's ongoing?

264
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:42,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be ongoing.

265
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,833
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't been able to block the Twilight hack thing, so that's going to be hard.

266
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if this homebrew channel thing gets blocked, you can still use...

267
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:51,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

268
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:17,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, going back over to Nintendo for a little bit, and Nintendo and Mistwalker's relationship.

269
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,723
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Mistwalker, of course, they have some games on the Xbox 360.

270
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:23,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of something interesting you may not realize.

271
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:27,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo doesn't really have anything officially on the calendar right now after Wii Fit has been out.

272
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:28,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

273
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:51,658
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it's been raided by the ESRB, then there must be a localization on the way.

274
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:56,719
[SPEAKER_13]: But that is interesting because that shows that Mistwalker is developing for more things than just Xbox.

275
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:02,920
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is kind of that weird relationship with Microsoft-owned studios because there's the Viva Pinata game already announced for DS as well.

276
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, THQ's doing a lot of those, and same with the Blue Dragon DS game, too.

277
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:13,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so it's not like Microsoft properties are afraid to go over to DS, which I think further cements the fact there won't be a Microsoft handheld anytime soon.

278
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,583
[SPEAKER_13]: So those rumors can just go away.

279
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:25,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hear about how they were originally thinking about adding connectivity with Viva Pinata 2 and the Viva Pinata DS?

280
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:27,165
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be very interesting, but could they do it?

281
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the way they had it done, it was only one way.

282
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:43,388
[SPEAKER_11]: You could transfer stuff from your DS version to your Xbox 360, and the way they did it was... I don't know, there was another story coming out that they were going to have cards that you could buy or something that would allow you to...

283
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say, this sounds like Eye of Judgment to me.

284
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that's how the game would work.

285
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:54,834
[SPEAKER_11]: It would produce a high-resolution picture on there, and then you would scan it with your camera.

286
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:59,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of Eye of Judgment, I looked at the OLR wiki this week.

287
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:03,979
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got awesome people maintaining the OLR wiki at orangelaunchradio.wikia.com.

288
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,461
[SPEAKER_13]: You can learn a lot of stuff about the inside jokes of our show and everything.

289
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:10,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, the Eye of Judgment has sold now 200,000 units.

290
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,364
[SPEAKER_13]: We're one-fifth of the way there.

291
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:13,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Never going to happen.

292
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:15,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Never gonna happen.

293
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:18,727
[SPEAKER_13]: I just love the fact that that's actually being tracked and updated on a regular basis.

294
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Start squirming, Loki.

295
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:20,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Start squirming.

296
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Love it.

297
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:23,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Five more years, it'll happen.

298
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

299
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:30,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, we're gonna get back into some gaming news.

300
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:30,713
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're not.

301
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:35,215
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna go to the mailbag because it's probably very full.

302
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:35,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Too bad.

303
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:36,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I refuse.

304
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:36,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Too bad.

305
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Then let the ferret read the emails tonight.

306
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:39,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Let TR read them.

307
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:39,977
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

308
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:40,937
[SPEAKER_13]: We gotta do some emails.

309
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,198
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the only one I'm gonna read is hers.

310
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:43,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Mailbag.

311
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,807
[SPEAKER_13]: You're only going to read one email after two weeks being gone?

312
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:46,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

313
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,207
[SPEAKER_12]: What do we want?

314
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus a few others.

315
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:49,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, thank you.

316
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to participate.

317
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:56,050
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, open up the Mailbag, pull out a few of your favorites and read them.

318
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,152
[SPEAKER_09]: This one says, Dear People, My girlfriend wants a DS and a PSP.

319
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,272
[SPEAKER_09]: She has a PS3.

320
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Please use... Oh my god!

321
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:06,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Please use a period.

322
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:06,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

323
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:10,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what was I saying?

324
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:10,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

325
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:13,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I was wondering... Did I mention when you email us, Jamie berates you?

326
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:37,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering, she's only 16 and I'm wondering, you already said you were wondering if you had any ideas for a game to buy her she loves music, RPGs and FPS, what teen rated games in the genre are good so I can make her a happy gamer girl, peace out DSMaster25 and DSLoverPS, we worship Hannah Montana

327
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:50,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Worship, W-O-E I Worship her too I would make a suggestion as for a good game For the DS, My Word Coach Yes

328
00:19:52,197 --> 00:20:13,277
[SPEAKER_09]: but you haven't really specified what system since you mentioned that she wants a DS and PSP indicating that she has neither and has a PS3 if they get a PSP there's not a lot of music games available for it actually there's no music games available for it in the United States Guitar Man, yeah that's about it I suggest getting her an Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip on it

329
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:20,925
[SPEAKER_11]: First Person Shooters, you're going to find a few of them on PSP, not so many on the DS.

330
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:22,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Give her a baby.

331
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:22,786
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what she really wants.

332
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:23,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Give her Imagine Babies.

333
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:25,647
[SPEAKER_09]: She can have my copy.

334
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:29,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it.

335
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:31,249
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw me play it.

336
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell her you're getting her ready for your long future together.

337
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:40,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so then I would... We're never going to get another email ever again.

338
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:47,731
[SPEAKER_11]: If she already has a PS3, you might as well just stick with the PSP because then you can connect to it and download stuff via the PlayStation Store.

339
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:48,472
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

340
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:53,536
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also PlayStation 1 games that are available on there and also if you want to really hack the thing apart, you can...

341
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:54,858
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

342
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think that you should install a dictionary and a thesaurus and a grammar checker for your phone.

343
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:43,474
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is cool because I honestly think that this person is Russian or from somewhere that uses the same form of alphabet.

344
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:46,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really all that great with names.

345
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:49,097
[SPEAKER_09]: But he sent the best screencap ever.

346
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:58,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Google search to define STFU and definitions of STFU on the web.

347
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:00,305
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the only one that came up.

348
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:05,909
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a weekly half hour show hosted by... It brings up the stuff on the show.

349
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:33,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice, so an old reference to the show that DMN hosted on the network DJ Tyrant too Yes, and DJ Tyrant DMN, I don't think DJ Tyrant is involved with this Maybe it's a special guest or something But DMN has teamed up with Travis Donovan And they now do a show on All Games Radio If you haven't heard it yet It's Under Sedation Live 4.0 So it's the show that Jamie and I started on All grown up and retarded I was the number one guest You were

350
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus I filled in for Jessica a couple times.

351
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, now they're up to 4.0.

352
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I filled in for you a couple of times.

353
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:39,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure did.

354
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:40,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I was lazy.

355
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:41,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are they now?

356
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:42,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob Roberts.

357
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:45,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to sit in the speaker chair.

358
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:46,748
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to give a cheap plug.

359
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:47,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Which we found the speaker chair.

360
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:48,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

361
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,732
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Desiree thrift store.

362
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:52,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

363
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:52,993
[SPEAKER_09]: We checked.

364
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:54,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

365
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:54,554
[SPEAKER_09]: A few years ago.

366
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:55,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

367
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:55,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

368
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,116
[SPEAKER_09]: This one comes from Sauce.

369
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, wait.

370
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,498
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to explain for the listeners.

371
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:01,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Listeners don't know Sauce.

372
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:02,160
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Sauce?

373
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Sauce.

374
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:09,871
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a group of us who have known each other for probably going on over 10 years online.

375
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:19,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kim, who is one of the group, used to always call me sis, but she's like a terrible typer, and she's like the typo queen.

376
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:27,364
[SPEAKER_01]: So one day she typoed, and instead of, she was trying to say, sits on sis, and she put sots on sauce.

377
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:28,165
Okay.

378
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:31,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ever since then, I've been Sauce, S-O-S.

379
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:36,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of, we made up names for everybody, like, after that.

380
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:37,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

381
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:41,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And mine is, when we get together, it's Soy Sauce Reunion.

382
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:42,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Soy Sauce.

383
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Cute.

384
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It works.

385
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,551
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hello, Sauce, Rob, and other guys.

386
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:48,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Girls are so weird, I swear.

387
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:52,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Get ferreted.

388
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:53,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Burn it.

389
00:23:53,393 --> 00:23:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Burn it.

390
00:23:54,073 --> 00:23:55,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this is the uber long review.

391
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:56,154
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

392
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:57,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I never pronounced this right.

393
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:58,203
[SPEAKER_09]: The Magia?

394
00:23:58,223 --> 00:23:58,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

395
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:31,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate them.

396
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:37,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate Skrulls worse.

397
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:40,331
[SPEAKER_09]: The story is good.

398
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:44,033
[SPEAKER_09]: The graphics are more than fairly decent, as is most of the voice acting.

399
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:50,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Tony Stark is much more brash and cocky than he is in the movie, and even I was surprised by some of the things he said.

400
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:51,618
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

401
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:21,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I can take a breath.

402
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:23,735
[SPEAKER_09]: You were really busy.

403
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:29,238
[SPEAKER_09]: The drawback to this game, at least on the PSP, is the way the player controls the game.

404
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,161
[SPEAKER_09]: The controls are very uncomfortable and took me quite a bit to get used to, especially the flying mechanics.

405
00:25:35,782 --> 00:25:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no option to change or rearrange the controls to make them easier to use.

406
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:44,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Using the square X O triangle buttons to control the camera and analog stick to control pushing

407
00:25:45,547 --> 00:26:03,747
[SPEAKER_09]: forward backwards motion was very uncomfortable for me especially since pushing up on the analog stick makes you walk or hover forward but moving into flight mode makes pushing up on the analog stick actually makes you go crashing down so it reverses from standard running around mode to like jet controls

408
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:09,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, whereas pushing down on the analog stick makes you pull back up.

409
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:17,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose in a way this makes sense, but the sudden reversal of the controls makes flying a pain, especially when you wind up running around and then jumping into flight a lot.

410
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:23,910
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me two run-throughs of the training level to get used to the controls, and even after 13 levels of play, I'm still hindered by the awkward controls.

411
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:26,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Overall, Iron Man for the PSP is a fun game.

412
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,614
[SPEAKER_09]: The controls, however, definitely detract from it overall.

413
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:33,396
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a die-hard Iron Man fan like I am, and she is...

414
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:35,657
[SPEAKER_09]: This is worth having in your collection.

415
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:39,159
[SPEAKER_09]: However, if your knowledge of Iron Man is based solely on the movie, I wouldn't bother.

416
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,581
[SPEAKER_09]: My overall rating for this game is 6.5 out of 10.

417
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:44,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks and keep up the great job with the show, TRI.

418
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:44,623
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

419
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:47,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob is so eating cake on my birthday.

420
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:48,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Frowning face.

421
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,186
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see, we'll see.

422
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,527
[SPEAKER_13]: But that was a good review.

423
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:54,569
[SPEAKER_13]: You should write reviews for our website whenever we get it working.

424
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:55,850
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

425
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, review wench.

426
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, Sauce has their own theme song.

427
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:02,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we can play it.

428
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

429
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

430
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:11,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Erotic.

431
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:12,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, erotic.

432
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:13,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play erotic's version.

433
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:14,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

434
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,033
[SPEAKER_12]: But the tiger took my family.

435
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That was, no.

436
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:44,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I would play erotic.

437
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,114
[SPEAKER_12]: But, no.

438
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I would play erotic's version.

439
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:54,117
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's officially, that is officially on Orange Young Radio.

440
00:27:54,157 --> 00:27:58,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, they do a song called Help Me Dr. Dick.

441
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:09,240
[SPEAKER_12]: We know this well.

442
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,522
[SPEAKER_12]: But this will come into play later.

443
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:17,667
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, someday in your nightmare, somebody's going to crop that little piece of show and play that over and over.

444
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,154
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a song called Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

445
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,437
[SPEAKER_13]: And the very first song... And they were huge in DDR, by the way.

446
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:34,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And the very first song I ever heard by them was before... Was actually when I was still playing Beatmania 98 before we even had a 2DX.

447
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:38,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Or when DDR was still just a thought.

448
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:40,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Was Don't Talk Dirty.

449
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:42,210
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like the best...

450
00:28:57,692 --> 00:29:00,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss DDR when it had songs like this in it.

451
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:03,594
[SPEAKER_13]: These songs are available on iTunes, by the way, and I highly suggest you buy the entire thing.

452
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:04,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Buy the entire thing.

453
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:06,515
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot make this shit up.

454
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,321
[SPEAKER_09]: We could, but we'd actually be telling the truth.

455
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:25,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email!

456
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:27,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, hold on.

457
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:31,986
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to read the... Look, I have the album Greatest Tits.

458
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:34,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the songs on Greatest Tits.

459
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:40,992
[SPEAKER_13]: The Horniest Single in the World, Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex, Willie Use a Billy Boy, Help Me, Dr. Dick.

460
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:54,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Fred, come to bed, turn me on, gotta get it grooving, give me good sex, Fritz, love my tits, sex on the phone, sexual madness, SOS, the winner takes it all, baby, please me, and in the dark of the night.

461
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we all know what happens in the dark of the night.

462
00:29:57,977 --> 00:30:00,978
[SPEAKER_09]: We have booty calls all over the stuff.

463
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:05,079
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two ABBA songs, and yeah.

464
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So next email, okay?

465
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to love sex on the phone, though.

466
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,520
[SPEAKER_13]: This song was awesome.

467
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Erotic's like the greatest band out of DDR.

468
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:20,184
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't have Don't Talk Dirty on it.

469
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:22,185
[SPEAKER_13]: They have tons of albums.

470
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,526
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just the greatest hits.

471
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:24,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Next email!

472
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:37,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Mailbag, like it can talk back, I'd like to think you all will have caught this piece of news, but since it was tagged onto the end of another story, I want to make sure you didn't miss it.

473
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Sky at least is a huge fan of ActRaiser.

474
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a link that says, loves you, Apollo.

475
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:47,104
[SPEAKER_09]: This message is not brought to you by Taco Bell because it is gross.

476
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:49,626
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on Gamasutra.

477
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I like what I'm hearing already about ActRaiser.

478
00:30:54,545 --> 00:31:00,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Square Enix is talking about WiiWare and new ActRaiser possibilities.

479
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Like an ActRaiser game on WiiWare?

480
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:05,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Like an all new thing?

481
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:07,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I will save this for the end of the show.

482
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:09,097
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

483
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:13,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I will make you wait in anticipation.

484
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:15,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

485
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Until Rob decides to play me some more erotic.

486
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:22,690
[SPEAKER_13]: You want some more erotic?

487
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,130
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

488
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:26,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means you have to wait a really fucking long time.

489
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:34,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I have Don't Talk Dirty?

490
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:35,640
[SPEAKER_09]: You should play it after the show.

491
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:37,061
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can find it.

492
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:37,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I have it.

493
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:38,102
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

494
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

495
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:41,925
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

496
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,033
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an iTunes sample.

497
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,794
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't have the actual chorus in there.

498
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:01,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't Talk Dirty was great.

499
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:10,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, this comes... It says, is the music in the background of your FUs of the week Jumpman by Buckethead, or did you remix it?

500
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:11,539
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

501
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I remixed it from Jumpman by Buckethead.

502
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:14,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you did?

503
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:14,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

504
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Pointless question by TJ Zeppelins in the chat.

505
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:22,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And since I wasn't on the mic, I remixed that from Jumpman by Buckethead.

506
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:23,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

507
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,806
[SPEAKER_09]: That was where my O came from.

508
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:26,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

509
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:28,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you, get out of my car.

510
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, listen.

511
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:35,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yesterday I listened to the Bobby Blackwolf show in OLR on the PSP's official internet radio player.

512
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:41,308
[SPEAKER_09]: The quality was really good, and there were no interruptions except for the times I disconnected and tried to reconnect.

513
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:42,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a couple of questions.

514
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:50,434
[SPEAKER_09]: One, is there any way to set the presets on the player, or is there another player that will work on the official Sony firmware?

515
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:52,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it was hard to find the all-game stream.

516
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:55,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Sadly, I don't think there is.

517
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:59,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I've played with that whole thing limitedly on the PSP.

518
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:01,187
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there is a way to do it, sadly.

519
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,688
[SPEAKER_13]: The PSP thing is very limited.

520
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:04,848
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucks.

521
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:08,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you were painting my neck.

522
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:09,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

523
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:11,269
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

524
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,430
[SPEAKER_12]: And for your intro.

525
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:19,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

526
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:20,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a ferret.

527
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:22,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, listen.

528
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, listen.

529
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:24,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, listen.

530
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:31,266
[SPEAKER_09]: 2.

531
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:31,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any PSP compatible way of IRC chatting?

532
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:33,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Listening live is great, but I want to chat too.

533
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Alpha Canogram says it's called FreePlay.

534
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,468
[SPEAKER_13]: It works for official firmware.

535
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:39,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm using it now and he's in chat.

536
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:50,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I also posted this in chat because I think the PSP and other devices could eventually be portable internet radio devices that could receive shows from all over the world.

537
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:56,254
[SPEAKER_09]: and the next question, when is the fuck show going to happen or has Black Wolf already shut that one down?

538
00:33:56,614 --> 00:34:00,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess Understudiation Life 4.0 does have that one every Saturday, LOL.

539
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:01,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, PKJr92.

540
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:03,856
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter where you go, you're there.

541
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,097
[SPEAKER_09]: We've said fuck an awful lot this episode, though, haven't we?

542
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:09,358
[SPEAKER_11]: If we told you when it was, that would break the rules of the fuck show.

543
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:10,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the fuck show is a surprise.

544
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,199
[SPEAKER_13]: I will tell you when it is not.

545
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,540
[SPEAKER_13]: The fuck show will not be the sixth anniversary show.

546
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,171
[SPEAKER_13]: And the sixth anniversary show is going to be... Whatever the fuck we want it.

547
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,852
[SPEAKER_13]: June... On the sixth anniversary.

548
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:25,634
[SPEAKER_13]: It can either be the... Probably the 22nd is the closest.

549
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:27,335
[SPEAKER_13]: June 22nd will be our sixth birthday.

550
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:29,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know what we're doing for that yet.

551
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:30,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

552
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:31,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Sixth birthday.

553
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:31,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

554
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know, for real.

555
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Our show is old enough to be in first grade.

556
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:37,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

557
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:39,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Six years ago, Orange Lounge Radio started.

558
00:34:40,104 --> 00:34:40,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it's crazy.

559
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:41,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck.

560
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,348
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I said.

561
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:45,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.

562
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:47,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

563
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:51,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, next email.

564
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I've got three left, okay.

565
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to be nice because we weren't here last weekend.

566
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:01,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, is there, okay, oh, we have one called Hello.

567
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:02,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

568
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:04,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone there?

569
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:05,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you fallen off the world?

570
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:06,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss you.

571
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad face Rick from UK.

572
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:11,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was when our stream went forever with no new updates.

573
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Part B went out on Friday or Saturday, so hopefully... Rob had the plague.

574
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:17,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I had SARS.

575
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:19,265
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no.

576
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:20,887
[SPEAKER_09]: They put him on the cart even.

577
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:24,049
[SPEAKER_09]: He was about to get carried off to the incendiary.

578
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:25,750
[SPEAKER_13]: But then he said he was going to go up for a walk.

579
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:27,912
[SPEAKER_09]: NextEmail.com

580
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:57,922
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat got it back.

581
00:35:57,942 --> 00:36:00,343
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say my cat pooped the rubber band today.

582
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so fucking proud.

583
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:06,445
[SPEAKER_13]: I am so fucking proud of you.

584
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:08,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really.

585
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:10,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what this show is resorted to?

586
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,227
[SPEAKER_09]: But cats are like our children.

587
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:16,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Coming up in Wii News, oh, my cat pooped out a rubber band today.

588
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:22,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very concerned because that means she ate a rubber band.

589
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have killed her.

590
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:27,256
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat eats grass.

591
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, fuck this show.

592
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:32,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I re-fix email?

593
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:34,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, I don't care anymore.

594
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So I says I can't, so this segment's over.

595
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:37,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

596
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everyone in the world!

597
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:45,924
[SPEAKER_09]: We may as well be fucking doing a drunk show because we're all lunatics.

598
00:36:46,344 --> 00:36:49,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, I would be drinking right now if it wouldn't kill me.

599
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:54,044
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who do not know me, I don't know you, so okay.

600
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:54,965
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

601
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:57,226
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Chris Phillips, a.k.a.

602
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:58,107
[SPEAKER_09]: ChrisPhil1724.

603
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:01,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Must be a really old school name.

604
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,052
[SPEAKER_09]: A tournament slash event organizer for all games and allgames.com.

605
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, he used to do video stuff for all games.

606
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I know he is.

607
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:10,275
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a good man, Charlie Brown.

608
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't cough up a rubber band.

609
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:16,554
[SPEAKER_09]: on July 24th, 2005.

610
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:49,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf aired his first live show on All Games Radio, known as The Bobby Blackwolf Show.

611
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:54,266
[SPEAKER_09]: This show was, in fact, the first ever weekly podcast on All Games Radio.

612
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:59,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever since that date, The Bobby Blackwolf Show has aired a new show every Sunday night at 8 p.m.

613
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,771
[SPEAKER_09]: EST, 5 p.m.

614
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:04,694
[SPEAKER_09]: PST, a streak that has lasted nearly 35 months.

615
00:38:05,555 --> 00:38:12,581
[SPEAKER_09]: This weekend was marked as the first week in 147 weeks without a new episode of The Bobby Blackwolf Show ending his remarkable run.

616
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:19,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Bobby would never broadcast this noteworthy accomplishment, and you may not even like the fact that I'm doing this.

617
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:23,449
[SPEAKER_09]: As fellow podcasters, you all know how hard it is to do a show week in and week out.

618
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:27,873
[SPEAKER_09]: To that end, I feel this achievement is worth mentioning, and congratulations are in order.

619
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,796
[SPEAKER_09]: If you'd like to write a small email to Bobby or... Oh my god, I'm sorry.

620
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,257
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing it live, Bobby!

621
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:33,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

622
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:38,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Well done, DarkSakura.

623
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hear it for Bobby Blackwell.

624
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:50,911
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking for the moaning noises, but alright.

625
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,074
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that is a good accomplishment.

626
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:55,775
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is.

627
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, God, we're lucky if we go ten weeks.

628
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:00,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

629
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:06,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear OLR and Loki 2, you know how that's gonna go.

630
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:10,269
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to know in the first four words how that's going to go.

631
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a Macintosh.

632
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:33,142
[SPEAKER_09]: and I don't use it to play games I can understand why Loki would not like a Macintosh computer because he uses his computer to play video games now can we shut up about this whole Loki hates Macintoshes thing they just don't deserve they just don't serve his needs to be honest we've sort of dropped this a long ass fucking time ago it's the listeners that keep bringing it up am I right?

633
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:41,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, once in a while there'll be a story and he'll make a snide comment that reminds us, but I don't think there's been a good old-fashioned brawl over it in a while.

634
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:44,383
[SPEAKER_13]: The only people bringing it up is the fucking Mac users.

635
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:48,548
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife does this every time a stupid Mac commercial comes on TV.

636
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:50,509
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like, see, they said it's true.

637
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:51,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, shut up.

638
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on TV.

639
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:53,872
[SPEAKER_11]: It must be true.

640
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:56,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll never forget when the Mac fan came to Fonamay.

641
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.

642
00:39:58,215 --> 00:39:59,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that last year.

643
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:01,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, by the way, notice we're not at Fonamay this year.

644
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

645
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,241
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a conspiracy by Mac users.

646
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,823
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we'll be back at Fonamay next year.

647
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,703
[SPEAKER_13]: I promise.

648
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:09,384
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to.

649
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,640
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're still around, my god, we're getting old.

650
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:13,661
[SPEAKER_09]: You are.

651
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,282
[SPEAKER_13]: If we don't die of old age first.

652
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:17,644
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna die of the plague.

653
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:18,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

654
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna die of awesome.

655
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:21,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Mario will cure it.

656
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna die of awesome.

657
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:23,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, are you gonna read any more of this email?

658
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I?

659
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:26,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Pick a paragraph.

660
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:27,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Read a paragraph.

661
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:28,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll read more.

662
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,695
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not why I wrote.

663
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:32,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote because I have a few things I want to say about Nintendo.

664
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:33,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, whatever.

665
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

666
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:39,841
[SPEAKER_09]: is basically saying that Nintendo sells a lot of stuff.

667
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:41,322
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

668
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:48,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you should post that on the super long email of the week thread.

669
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:51,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to do that because right now my throat hurts.

670
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And it actually is from Hippolytus, a.k.a.

671
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:55,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Boy, who we remember.

672
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:56,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

673
00:40:57,073 --> 00:41:06,220
[SPEAKER_09]: You are actually going to be the person who brings back the long-ass fucking email thread of the week.

674
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:08,654
[SPEAKER_09]: on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

675
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:09,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

676
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:11,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Does this call for fanfare?

677
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:12,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

678
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good email, but my throat hurts a lot.

679
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I will post it on the forums and link it in the chat room.

680
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Long email is very long.

681
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,803
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to send us long emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

682
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:34,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Meantime, more gaming news.

683
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:35,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Loki?

684
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:35,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

685
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just reading something else that's kind of interesting.

686
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:41,993
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is sort of interesting.

687
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,435
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be more interesting if it weren't the N-Gage.

688
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:45,355
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, yes.

689
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:52,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Metal Gear Solid Mobile has somehow found its way on the N-Gage.

690
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:53,962
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

691
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:56,744
[SPEAKER_11]: You will be able to play Metal Gear Solid.

692
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:02,027
[SPEAKER_11]: The winner of two 2007 International Mobile Gaming Awards.

693
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:03,709
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh...

694
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:10,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it's coming to the N-Gage shortly after the launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 for the PS3.

695
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:15,092
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um... That's cool, I guess.

696
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:18,933
[SPEAKER_11]: At least they're getting some actual big-name games.

697
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:21,733
[SPEAKER_11]: N-Gage is still around.

698
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:23,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

699
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:28,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, do you remember Nolan Bushnell?

700
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:30,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you do, because he was one of the...

701
00:42:31,775 --> 00:42:33,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese, right?

702
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:35,338
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Pizza Time Theater.

703
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:36,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, whatever.

704
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the name better.

705
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:38,761
[SPEAKER_13]: And Pong, right?

706
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:38,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

707
00:42:39,562 --> 00:42:47,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he apparently was speaking at the Wedbush Morgan Securities Annual Management Access Conference.

708
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,912
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's saying the game piracy, it's on its way out.

709
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:58,419
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, quote, there is a stealth encryption chip called a TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now.

710
00:42:59,019 --> 00:42:59,640
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not gonna work.

711
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:16,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that?

712
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:17,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Because everything can be cracked.

713
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that you said that it can't be cracked is just going to make people want to crack it.

714
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It is an invitation to the crackers to say, please crack this.

715
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:28,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me, if it can be modified, it will be modified on the board.

716
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:30,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they'll find a way to emulate it and they'll just disable it.

717
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:32,778
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to do everything.

718
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:34,220
[SPEAKER_12]: It has been done before.

719
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Or they'll just stop buying games altogether.

720
00:44:00,393 --> 00:44:00,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

721
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:27,668
[SPEAKER_11]: There are games out there now that have it, you know, where you have to play it, you know, and it talks to a server online to validate that it's an official copy of the game.

722
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:28,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Those have been cracked.

723
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:34,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's stuff on the PSP that they've had countless firmware upgrades that are supposed to prevent piracy and stuff.

724
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:36,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Those have all been cracked.

725
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:43,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, what... Ranma in chat, chat.orange.com says, Intel tried that with their Pentium 3 chips and boards.

726
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:43,493
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't work.

727
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:50,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, it's a nice attempt, and, you know, people should be a little bit more legit with stuff, but it's just not gonna happen.

728
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,920
[SPEAKER_11]: It really isn't, so... I don't know.

729
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because you stop people from pirating a game does not mean that they are gonna go buy your game.

730
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,264
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the other problem, too.

731
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:08,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're assuming that people that are pirating these things had intended to buy it in the first place.

732
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,048
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not always the case.

733
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:10,488
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good point.

734
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:13,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of pirates probably wouldn't even bother buying the games.

735
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I really think that.

736
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:21,754
[SPEAKER_13]: But it sounds like maybe he's trying to combat piracy in other countries, not necessarily just the US, but where it's way more rampant.

737
00:45:22,656 --> 00:45:23,418
[SPEAKER_11]: You think that might be the case?

738
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:24,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

739
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:32,706
[SPEAKER_11]: But if anything, the Chinese and stuff, they've gotten piracy down big time.

740
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:36,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't see this affecting much.

741
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:37,528
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

742
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't know about you guys, but I get the feeling we've heard this all before.

743
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,070
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I hear things and I don't see results, I get irritated.

744
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,451
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I get irritated, we do the FUs of the week.

745
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,435
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the dollar store.

746
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:08,700
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to get a USB cable, and there were none out on the shelf.

747
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the whole supply of them wasn't there.

748
00:46:11,363 --> 00:46:18,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So I asked if someone would go and look in the back and see if there were any, because just about any other store I go to, people are willing to look in the back and just, oh, we don't have any.

749
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:20,013
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was it.

750
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:27,211
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the virtual friends in Grand Theft Auto 4.

751
00:46:27,732 --> 00:46:29,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to go do activities with you.

752
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,555
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm not calling you back, you idiots.

753
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:34,677
[SPEAKER_11]: But at least they have sleep mode.

754
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:36,038
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's still annoying.

755
00:46:36,218 --> 00:46:39,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's still annoying though when you have people going, I haven't heard from you forever.

756
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go drinking.

757
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:42,062
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, fuck that.

758
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:43,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to shoot pigeons.

759
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:46,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So they don't understand.

760
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:57,102
[SPEAKER_13]: My FU of the week goes to the antibiotic C-Pro, which I was taking because the doctor thought I had an infection, even though I'm pretty sure I had a virus based on the high fever I had and the fact that the antibiotics didn't really work.

761
00:46:57,577 --> 00:47:25,432
[SPEAKER_13]: but I was taking it for so long that finally like my chest started to like tighten up and I got a big old red rash on my chest so I stopped taking it because that's not a good reaction to have especially when you just had pancreatitis so I chose to stop taking it so F you to C-Pro DrewNami F you to friends, so-called friends who make their mission in life to bring your ass down I'm not naming names no one anyone here would know

762
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:37,683
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to Rock Band and all its goodness for making my throat hurt like hell and FU to Mellow Gear Solid 2.

763
00:47:38,643 --> 00:47:41,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop busting me.

764
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:43,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because I suck.

765
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:45,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything you want to say FU to?

766
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:47,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, thanks.

767
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:49,746
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to you for being so happy.

768
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, really, we're jealous.

769
00:47:52,407 --> 00:47:53,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, what's your secret?

770
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

771
00:47:57,301 --> 00:47:58,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

772
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,223
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura is going to take it.

773
00:48:01,403 --> 00:48:02,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she's coughing.

774
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:04,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to ask, are you sure you didn't have anthrax?

775
00:48:04,345 --> 00:48:06,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Cipro is what they give you if you have anthrax.

776
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:07,827
[SPEAKER_01]: For real, huh?

777
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,068
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I did not have anthrax.

778
00:48:09,108 --> 00:48:09,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank gosh.

779
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:11,849
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have an anthrax CD somewhere.

780
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:14,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you start developing the rash as soon as you started taking it?

781
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:15,431
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was about five days into it.

782
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:16,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Five days into it?

783
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:16,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

784
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:38,003
[SPEAKER_13]: of course she didn't have anthrax it does suck I've been to the doctor so much in the past two months I couldn't go back over the rash I was just like you know what I feel fine I'm just not going to take it I have some drug stuff to talk to you about after the show too because I know drug stuff yay drugs drugs are rad there's a new Pokemon game coming out yay

785
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:41,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Pokemon, colors we haven't thought of yet.

786
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:11,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I still like my Pokemans, but I have a feeling this will be just Emerald all over again.

787
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon's a good game.

788
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:19,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, Platinum sounds like... I don't know.

789
00:49:19,862 --> 00:49:22,645
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't help but think of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

790
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:29,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Pokemon Pearl for a while, but I only played it at the gym while I was riding the recumbent bike.

791
00:49:31,528 --> 00:49:43,676
[SPEAKER_11]: So, apparently the casting has, or some rumors about casting have come out about the Prince of Persia movie, and Jake Gyllenhaal is now reported to be the Prince of Persia.

792
00:49:43,696 --> 00:49:46,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's... Because he looks so Persian.

793
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:47,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

794
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:48,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally.

795
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Bubble Boy is the Prince of Persia.

796
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:52,881
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

797
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:56,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Bubble Boy was on TV the other day.

798
00:49:56,884 --> 00:49:58,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I've watched that way too many times.

799
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,341
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I don't know.

800
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be too excited about this.

801
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:08,447
[SPEAKER_11]: He just looks too lethargic.

802
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:09,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

803
00:50:09,068 --> 00:50:13,712
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just very like... I have to act?

804
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:20,938
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as it's hot like Brokeback Mountain, then we're fine.

805
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:23,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't quit you, Prince of Persia.

806
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me?

807
00:50:25,101 --> 00:50:26,041
[SPEAKER_13]: A baking powder?

808
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:32,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of video game movies, $200 million!

809
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:34,568
[SPEAKER_13]: $200 million, Variety reports.

810
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:40,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Crystal Sky Pictures has signed this deal for $200 million financing.

811
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:45,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And what this millions of dollars is going to be used, it's going to fund Castlevania

812
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:52,716
[SPEAKER_13]: A sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled and Pac-Man, the movie.

813
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're making Stranglehold the game, the movie, and then the game?

814
00:50:56,837 --> 00:50:58,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it'll come back around again.

815
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,898
[SPEAKER_12]: What a horrible night to have a movie.

816
00:51:00,399 --> 00:51:04,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Now look, we know that Castlevania has been, like, this has been off and on with Rider Strike and everything.

817
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,282
[SPEAKER_13]: We know this was on the table, but seriously, Pac-Man, the movie, like...

818
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:12,430
[SPEAKER_13]: How in the hell is that going to work?

819
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Pac-Man did have a TV show.

820
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:15,431
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a drug addict.

821
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,231
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a cartoon.

822
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:17,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess if Pac-Man's a cartoon, it might work.

823
00:51:17,752 --> 00:51:18,493
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a dumb idea.

824
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:19,673
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a pill popper.

825
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:24,595
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a dumb idea, although we did throw around the premise of a Pac-Man movie.

826
00:51:26,696 --> 00:51:36,861
[SPEAKER_00]: One man in the future will save the world from Inky, Binky, and Clyde using dots.

827
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:38,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you talking like Triple H?

828
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:40,387
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the movie man.

829
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:48,854
[SPEAKER_11]: No, what you would do is you would have a cop on the edge, you know, played by Joe Pesci.

830
00:51:49,254 --> 00:51:49,895
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not Joe Pesci.

831
00:51:49,935 --> 00:51:53,198
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be funny, though.

832
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:55,700
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew too much.

833
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the ghosts of his past are after him.

834
00:51:59,403 --> 00:52:00,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Gerardimo wins.

835
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,906
[SPEAKER_13]: He says the Pac-Man movie will have Kylie Minowas miss Pac-Man and it'll be awesome.

836
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:05,047
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good point.

837
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:05,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

838
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:10,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not want.

839
00:52:10,787 --> 00:52:11,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not want.

840
00:52:19,034 --> 00:52:22,277
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, what could they possibly do a Pac-Man movie about?

841
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:23,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you ever seen the cartoon from the 80s?

842
00:52:23,538 --> 00:52:26,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, the cartoon from the 80s was great, and there was Pac-Land.

843
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:30,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless there is only one feasible way I could see this happening.

844
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:30,965
[SPEAKER_11]: 3D.

845
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:34,288
[SPEAKER_11]: And it would not be a movie that they would be able to promote very well.

846
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:39,189
[SPEAKER_11]: is if they did a Pac-Man porno where they dressed everybody up in ridiculous costumes and made them have sex.

847
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:40,990
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only way this could work.

848
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:45,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It's scary, but it's the only feasible way this could possibly work.

849
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Not sure if want.

850
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:51,952
[SPEAKER_13]: We reached out to Atari for comment on the Pac-Man movie and this is all they had to say.

851
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:59,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad it's Namco that's gonna be taking care of that.

852
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:02,777
[SPEAKER_13]: My theory... It's a joke from like three weeks ago.

853
00:53:02,797 --> 00:53:03,958
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it is.

854
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:04,878
[SPEAKER_13]: That was for the fans.

855
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:07,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, I missed the bus.

856
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I missed the bus, sorry.

857
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:13,144
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

858
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel it's going to be CG.

859
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:16,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

860
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:18,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel it's going to be poop.

861
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:22,490
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a pooped out rubber band.

862
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

863
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:27,814
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to take that toilet paper joke book...

864
00:53:32,472 --> 00:53:35,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn it upside down and turn that front.

865
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:44,641
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100Matt says that Jessica Alba should be Mrs. Pac-Man, but that makes me think that all games Jessica, if she doesn't get the role in that horror movie, she should make Ms.

866
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:45,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Pac-Man her next goal.

867
00:53:46,482 --> 00:53:47,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, I'm only recycling your material.

868
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:51,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, if she doesn't win that, don't you think she's suffered enough?

869
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:53,867
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

870
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:56,689
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

871
00:53:58,806 --> 00:53:59,767
[SPEAKER_13]: More news, please.

872
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:00,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I have news?

873
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:01,467
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't.

874
00:54:02,128 --> 00:54:04,089
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have... Okay.

875
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:11,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for people who give a shit, and I'm not one of them, Postal's coming to Blu-ray in August.

876
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:16,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Postal is that movie made by... What's his name?

877
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:18,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Who did a bunch of shitty movies?

878
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:20,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Uwe Boll!

879
00:54:20,497 --> 00:54:21,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he sucks.

880
00:54:22,198 --> 00:54:23,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Sadly enough, I have this pre-ordered already.

881
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:24,760
[SPEAKER_09]: You do?! !

882
00:54:26,118 --> 00:54:28,180
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

883
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:53,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, what?

884
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,062
[SPEAKER_09]: It grossed less than $5 million.

885
00:54:58,082 --> 00:55:00,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's only in four theaters.

886
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:04,287
[SPEAKER_09]: It grossed less than $5.

887
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:07,609
[SPEAKER_11]: How did it even make $5 million?

888
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,471
[SPEAKER_11]: It shows not $5,000.

889
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:13,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first off, it just came out, I mean, literally this week.

890
00:55:14,154 --> 00:55:15,195
[SPEAKER_09]: We wish it would go back.

891
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I'd see it.

892
00:55:17,765 --> 00:55:21,347
[SPEAKER_11]: But, see, because this looks actually semi-interesting to me.

893
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:24,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I've watched an UiBowl movie before, the Blood Rain 2 movie.

894
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting premise, execution was shit.

895
00:55:29,652 --> 00:55:31,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, you're part of the problem.

896
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:34,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I had to watch it in order to talk to UiBowl, okay?

897
00:55:34,715 --> 00:55:35,656
[SPEAKER_11]: We interviewed him.

898
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:36,857
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fun.

899
00:55:37,237 --> 00:55:39,178
[SPEAKER_11]: You're part of the reason he keeps making this shit.

900
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:42,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I didn't actually pay you to see this movie.

901
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:44,425
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a screener.

902
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:46,226
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I get to talk to him.

903
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:46,847
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool.

904
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:49,048
[SPEAKER_11]: He's making a game, too, by the way.

905
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:51,349
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Tunnel Rat.

906
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

907
00:55:55,191 --> 00:56:01,395
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's about these guys that are in Vietnam, and they go into the... Oh, dude, Tunnel Rat was the name of the G.I.

908
00:56:01,435 --> 00:56:01,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe.

909
00:56:03,036 --> 00:56:06,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, probably named for the same reason, but... Yeah.

910
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:07,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

911
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk about another movie that's going to suck.

912
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:13,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to see how much Postal made over the weekend, but it's not even on the top ten.

913
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:14,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Surprise.

914
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:17,955
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to think where you would go to see that.

915
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I looked at Box Office Mojo.

916
00:56:19,395 --> 00:56:20,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't find it.

917
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,357
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm looking now for the Rotten Tomatoes score.

918
00:56:22,377 --> 00:56:24,958
[SPEAKER_13]: 11% on Rotten Tomatoes for Postal.

919
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:26,219
[SPEAKER_11]: IMDB sometimes has the...

920
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:38,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at positive reviews for Postal.

921
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:38,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

922
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:49,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Prairie Miller from Newsblaze says, Along the way to its parking lot showdown, a wacky property damage conspiracy to commit insurance fraud is uncovered between Osama and Bush.

923
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:53,470
[SPEAKER_13]: The darker, zany recesses of America is viewed from the Twilight Zone.

924
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Move over, Barat.

925
00:56:56,198 --> 00:56:56,439
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

926
00:56:56,919 --> 00:56:57,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

927
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's another positive review from Cam Williams.

928
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:05,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I suppose since almost seven years have passed since 9-11, America might finally be ready to laugh at the tragedy.

929
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:09,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Tasteless, profane, and far-fetched, but undeniably funny, too.

930
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:10,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

931
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:11,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Dot, dot, dot.

932
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:12,669
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I have to say.

933
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Film threat, Jeremy Knox.

934
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:22,276
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not perfect, and will get on the nerves of the more opinionated critics out there, but it's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.

935
00:57:23,993 --> 00:57:28,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the three positive reviews, giving it 11% on Rotten Tomatoes right now.

936
00:57:29,002 --> 00:57:30,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have to admit, the poster is pretty funny.

937
00:57:31,426 --> 00:57:35,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's offensive, it's highly offensive, but it's mildly amusing.

938
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:38,814
[SPEAKER_11]: LucasArts, Activision, and NVIDIA

939
00:58:03,476 --> 00:58:07,537
[SPEAKER_11]: or Activision Blizzard, which I still don't understand why they're still referring to them as two different companies.

940
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:08,978
[SPEAKER_11]: But whatever.

941
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:16,561
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's unclear what their decision, why they decided to drop out of the ESA, but we do know that they're gone.

942
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:21,582
[SPEAKER_13]: So apparently... One more out the door.

943
00:58:22,022 --> 00:58:22,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

944
00:58:24,643 --> 00:58:26,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Any theories why this is happening, Loki?

945
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:27,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

946
00:58:28,018 --> 00:58:30,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they just don't feel like ESA is representing them enough.

947
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:36,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe they're just getting cheap and they don't want to pay the money to the ESA to help defend them.

948
00:58:36,323 --> 00:58:38,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And besides, I mean, think about it this way.

949
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:41,887
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they're defending the game industry, okay?

950
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:45,529
[SPEAKER_11]: And anybody that's joined up with the ESA has to pay them to defend the game industry.

951
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:49,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you drop out of the ESA, they're still defending you.

952
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:51,072
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like you're getting a free ride.

953
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:55,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Robin Chat says the ESA business seems to be the beginning of a new consortium.

954
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:57,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, it sounded pretty gay to me.

955
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did you say that?

956
00:59:02,384 --> 00:59:05,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're just freeloading on this shit.

957
00:59:06,267 --> 00:59:19,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's just my opinion on why they're, I mean, it makes perfect business sense if, you know, okay, well I can eliminate this cost and they're still doing the work for me, so, as unethical as it is, eh, whatever.

958
00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:25,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, speaking of things that are pretty gay, Xbox Live has been going on a banning marathon lately.

959
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:29,091
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of bannings recently have caught some attention.

960
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:33,494
[SPEAKER_13]: The Gayer Gamer was a gamer tag that got banned recently.

961
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:36,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, this gamer tag got banned.

962
00:59:36,816 --> 00:59:40,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Richard Gaywood was a gamer tag that got banned.

963
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:42,300
[SPEAKER_13]: And you might be thinking, ha ha ha, Gaywood.

964
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,761
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a street near here.

965
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:44,761
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Gaywood Street.

966
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:45,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Dick Gaywood.

967
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:46,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

968
00:59:46,743 --> 00:59:49,504
[SPEAKER_13]: His name is really Richard Gaywood.

969
00:59:49,804 --> 00:59:51,646
[SPEAKER_13]: His parents apparently hate him.

970
00:59:52,246 --> 00:59:53,226
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's the last name.

971
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:54,327
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't get to pick your last name.

972
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:57,229
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a scan of his driver's license up on the internet.

973
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:58,410
[SPEAKER_13]: His name was Richard Gaywood.

974
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:02,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, why you would want to use your name as your gamer tag is beyond me.

975
01:00:02,872 --> 01:00:04,813
[SPEAKER_13]: But granted, did Xbox...

976
01:00:05,854 --> 01:00:06,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Overreact.

977
01:00:07,254 --> 01:00:10,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Some gay-themed websites chimed in on this.

978
01:00:11,295 --> 01:00:18,296
[SPEAKER_13]: LesbianGamer said, I've taken a few deep breaths, run this story over in my mind again and again, and yet still return to the same annoying factor.

979
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:25,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Why does gay automatically equate to sex or of asexual nature and carry with it such negative and deviant overtones?

980
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:33,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I can understand Microsoft is trying to protect users, but perhaps there needs to be some tabled debate as to what they're protecting whom from and what they're perpetuating in the process.

981
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:38,160
[SPEAKER_13]: linking gay to some negative or sexually explicit content merely fans of fires of homophobia.

982
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:52,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Gay Gamer said this, I'm somewhat on the fence with the issue having played many MMORPGs and seeing the many annoying and disturbing names that can come from the idle minds on the internets and it seems as if Microsoft is putting up the normal we can't make exceptions defense.

983
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:59,766
[SPEAKER_13]: All of this however is greatly outweighed by the fact that it is given name and despite the connotations it may carry with it he lives with that name every day.

984
01:01:00,817 --> 01:01:09,811
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm sure you've probably been wondering what I, the gay host of Orange Lawn Radio have to say on this subject and honestly, you want my honest opinion on this subject?

985
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:13,957
[SPEAKER_13]: We have much bigger things to worry about in life than this.

986
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:34,574
[SPEAKER_13]: for instance they are going to try and overturn the recent gay marriage thing that was passed in the state of California by the Supreme Court finally have allowed gay marriage to happen in the state in less than 30 days and the crazies are going to try and put it on the November ballot and according to recent polls 54% of Californians would vote for it

987
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:36,730
[SPEAKER_13]: to overturn gay marriage.

988
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:46,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, yeah, suddenly you're going to let gays marry and there's going to be like this just sudden fuckwave going through the state and everybody's going to start fucking everywhere because that's what happens when you let gays get married.

989
01:01:46,477 --> 01:01:49,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Next thing you know, cats will marry dogs and up is down.

990
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.

991
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid.

992
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:56,385
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know what I have to say?

993
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:58,046
[SPEAKER_13]: The hell with Xbox Live.

994
01:01:58,086 --> 01:01:58,927
[SPEAKER_13]: It's their service.

995
01:01:58,947 --> 01:02:00,428
[SPEAKER_13]: They can do whatever they want.

996
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:03,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, yeah, it's a little asinine, but whatever.

997
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, I have a question.

998
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,090
[SPEAKER_13]: We have more important things to worry about right now.

999
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:08,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1000
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:13,552
[SPEAKER_01]: If gay marriage is allowed, wouldn't that, like, lower the amount of gay sex that's happening?

1001
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:16,892
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because once you get married, you stop having sex.

1002
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:17,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it really would.

1003
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:18,372
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a point.

1004
01:02:18,392 --> 01:02:22,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that would be good for the, you know, the right wing if, you know, gay marriage was allowed.

1005
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to the Olive Garden Roundtable.

1006
01:02:25,594 --> 01:02:32,135
[SPEAKER_09]: That, and there would be a lot more economic growth for all of the gay men registering.

1007
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:34,467
[SPEAKER_13]: I loved what Ellen said.

1008
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:40,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry to get political on this show but for obvious reasons this is something I feel very, very strongly and it won't be the last time I say something about it.

1009
01:02:40,992 --> 01:02:43,034
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a deal.

1010
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:44,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see any of us protesting?

1011
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:44,935
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know, I know.

1012
01:02:45,236 --> 01:02:55,664
[SPEAKER_13]: But I love what Ellen said to John McCain is that she said something about she compared it to and it's really like this is that you say there's two chairs over there and you can sit in one but you can't sit in the other.

1013
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:56,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

1014
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:57,225
[SPEAKER_13]: You just can't.

1015
01:02:59,027 --> 01:02:59,787
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it feels like.

1016
01:03:00,248 --> 01:03:00,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about it.

1017
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:01,669
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1018
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:03,526
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1019
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:06,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I am against chair marriage as well.

1020
01:03:07,427 --> 01:03:08,487
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just wrong.

1021
01:03:10,048 --> 01:03:11,008
[SPEAKER_11]: What would we do without you?

1022
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:18,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly, I think that the best, one of the best, and I'm sure a lot of people know by now I'm a big fan of the show Bullshit.

1023
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch the episode about gay marriage and polyamory.

1024
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

1025
01:03:24,537 --> 01:03:26,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank God for the youth of America.

1026
01:03:26,238 --> 01:03:29,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I seriously think I'm probably preaching to the choir most people of this show.

1027
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:35,441
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I know we have tons and tons of heterosexual people that listen to this show that probably listen to this and go, what's the big freaking deal?

1028
01:03:36,202 --> 01:03:37,362
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we're saying.

1029
01:03:37,682 --> 01:03:38,602
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all we're saying.

1030
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:40,323
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the big freaking deal?

1031
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:43,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people have the religious corncob up their ass.

1032
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:45,865
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot less comfortable than other things to be up their ass.

1033
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:46,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what.

1034
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:49,527
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a million other things we're going to hell for before gay marriage.

1035
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:50,207
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you that.

1036
01:03:51,386 --> 01:03:53,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, moving on.

1037
01:03:53,688 --> 01:03:55,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Please get me off my political tangent.

1038
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll kick the soapbox out from under you.

1039
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:06,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how about we speak of our common nemesis that we have with the rest of the video game community.

1040
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone can agree, no matter what.

1041
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:10,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone can agree.

1042
01:04:10,623 --> 01:04:11,944
[SPEAKER_09]: He who shall not be named.

1043
01:04:12,104 --> 01:04:13,005
[SPEAKER_13]: That this guy's a moron.

1044
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:18,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna say his name so that I can read this headline, which is wonderful.

1045
01:04:18,906 --> 01:04:24,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack Thompson, guilty man, 27 of 31 misconduct charges recommended by judge.

1046
01:04:26,114 --> 01:04:28,876
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lovely picture under this on the Destructoid article.

1047
01:04:28,896 --> 01:04:29,857
[SPEAKER_13]: You said his name.

1048
01:04:29,997 --> 01:04:32,220
[SPEAKER_09]: This is karma, you dump it, you drink it.

1049
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:32,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Lovely.

1050
01:04:35,263 --> 01:04:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Lovely.

1051
01:04:35,822 --> 01:04:46,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, um, so basically, um, dude is on, uh, dude's guilty for fucking up.

1052
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:49,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Did Jack Thompson jump up and go, objection!

1053
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:50,812
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because he's not that cute.

1054
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:51,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Overruled, bitch.

1055
01:04:53,194 --> 01:04:57,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I, the day that he is completely, um, what's the word, disbarred?

1056
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:01,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to...

1057
01:05:03,723 --> 01:05:04,563
[SPEAKER_09]: What's something awesome?

1058
01:05:05,463 --> 01:05:09,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, when Jack Thompson is disbarred, I might dress up as Tingle.

1059
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:10,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

1060
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:11,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh!

1061
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:13,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh!

1062
01:05:13,545 --> 01:05:13,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit.

1063
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he just said he might.

1064
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:23,888
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're having the results of the disbarring trial on June 4th, so it is, you know, like... I didn't say I would, I said I might.

1065
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:24,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you did, you said you would.

1066
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:25,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I said I might.

1067
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:26,708
[SPEAKER_11]: No takes and bansies.

1068
01:05:26,728 --> 01:05:27,468
[SPEAKER_11]: What did his June 4th fall on?

1069
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:33,491
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be live on Wednesday, June 4th.

1070
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:33,991
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

1071
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:34,712
[SPEAKER_09]: If they let us.

1072
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:37,414
[SPEAKER_13]: We will record live.

1073
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:38,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Where would I get a Tingle outfit?

1074
01:05:39,755 --> 01:05:40,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Where would I even get that?

1075
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:44,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma would send one to you.

1076
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:45,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you know what?

1077
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,060
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1078
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,261
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll bring back Dr. Dick.

1079
01:05:48,202 --> 01:05:48,642
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1080
01:05:49,563 --> 01:05:50,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Mr. Spanky.

1081
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:55,067
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be celebration of some sort happening when Lord Voldemort is disbarred.

1082
01:05:57,155 --> 01:06:02,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's... And on top of that, we need to send a letter to Ice Cube.

1083
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:03,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Wiki this, please.

1084
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:04,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

1085
01:06:05,101 --> 01:06:07,282
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it wasn't Ice Cube, it was Ice T. Why?

1086
01:06:07,622 --> 01:06:12,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Fuckhead got him back in the 90s for his album, remember?

1087
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:13,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

1088
01:06:13,246 --> 01:06:14,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Because his big thing was music.

1089
01:06:15,248 --> 01:06:16,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he moved from music to video games.

1090
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:20,651
[SPEAKER_09]: All this guy wants is to have the world lick his ass.

1091
01:06:21,072 --> 01:06:21,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Not kiss it, lick it.

1092
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:23,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Licking is far more disgusting.

1093
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:25,915
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1094
01:06:27,168 --> 01:06:29,629
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to be opening up the Skype line very soon.

1095
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:31,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's pay Paula Terry to do that.

1096
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:36,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it sounds just like her singing.

1097
01:06:36,471 --> 01:06:42,974
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR But first, one more story that's not about Lord Voldemort or tingle dressing.

1098
01:06:43,494 --> 01:06:45,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and this is not a bad story, actually.

1099
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:51,457
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be some Japanese songs that may be hitting rock band very soon, actually.

1100
01:06:53,604 --> 01:07:06,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, a Harmonix developer told Joystick during Rock Band's party in New York City that they will be seeing some Japanese rock music in the games.

1101
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:13,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, there should be an announcement coming soon, but who knows?

1102
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:16,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe some stuff like TM Revolution, Malice Miser...

1103
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:18,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Outro Music

1104
01:07:33,703 --> 01:07:34,964
[SPEAKER_09]: But Basewolf is dead.

1105
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they replace... Gacked, maybe.

1106
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Bees, definitely.

1107
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:39,509
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1108
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,350
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably have Smop or something.

1109
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, this is what Activision needs to do, okay?

1110
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:51,660
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to make an actual game that's going to be something that stands out from all these other music games out there, you make the official Guitar Wolf game.

1111
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,623
[SPEAKER_11]: You have it be an action game with music playing in it as well.

1112
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:54,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Zombies.

1113
01:07:55,043 --> 01:07:58,349
[SPEAKER_11]: with zombies and you fight zombies with your awesome guitar skills.

1114
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:00,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, this is a good game here.

1115
01:08:00,552 --> 01:08:03,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would fight zombies with your guitar and you're a Japanese rock star.

1116
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:05,280
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd probably, though, have, like...

1117
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:06,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Bumper Chicken

1118
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:31,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering where that was.

1119
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:32,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in my house.

1120
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:33,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

1121
01:08:33,696 --> 01:08:37,018
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.

1122
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:37,939
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1123
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:39,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1124
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:44,864
[SPEAKER_13]: We only have time for a couple calls tonight, so we're going to try to keep this short and keep the calls short, too.

1125
01:08:44,924 --> 01:08:45,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1126
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:46,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1127
01:08:47,066 --> 01:08:47,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, hey, hey.

1128
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,929
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now level 30 DJ Ranma S. It's not Zaku.

1129
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:52,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Why level 30 Ranma S?

1130
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:57,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I just served my big level 30 this past weekend, and I am sober.

1131
01:08:58,732 --> 01:08:59,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Congrats.

1132
01:08:59,192 --> 01:08:59,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa.

[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you are having the same birthday that I'm having next month.

[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:07,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, congrats to you.

[SPEAKER_13]: Congrats on your ding, man.

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1138
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:12,124
[SPEAKER_13]: What else is on your mind besides that you're old?

[SPEAKER_10]: I finally got my Xbox 360.

[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of wish I'd gotten it soon, but I'm pretty happy with it.

1142
01:09:21,512 --> 01:09:25,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to thank Loki because he's been randy about Saints Row and Crackdown.

[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:33,484
[SPEAKER_10]: What'd you think?

1156
01:10:34,284 --> 01:10:35,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played it yet but this is the way I look at it.

1157
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:37,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Free game is free.

1158
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Free game is free but free game is also a bit of a waste of time.

1159
01:10:40,429 --> 01:10:41,189
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you laughing at?

1160
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:41,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1161
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,152
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura's being very distracting tonight because she's laughing at something.

1162
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:49,235
[SPEAKER_01]: She's showing us this YouTube video of a flying penis.

1163
01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:52,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that, that was funny.

1164
01:10:53,356 --> 01:10:55,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember the penis age in Second Life?

1165
01:10:55,637 --> 01:10:56,377
[SPEAKER_13]: This is real life.

1166
01:10:57,217 --> 01:11:00,038
[SPEAKER_13]: That is so stupid, and you guys are like laughing.

1167
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:02,039
[SPEAKER_13]: How old are you?

1168
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:03,159
[SPEAKER_13]: How old are you?

1169
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:03,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Five?

1170
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:04,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Six?

1171
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:06,460
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to do with gaming.

1172
01:11:07,301 --> 01:11:09,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a chess champion speech?

1173
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:12,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was, yeah, they had that on Best Week Ever.

1174
01:11:13,163 --> 01:11:14,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, Ranma, for that.

1175
01:11:15,043 --> 01:11:19,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anything else you wanted to share besides the flying penis copter, as SackDeft calls it?

1176
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:22,121
[SPEAKER_10]: No comment.

1177
01:11:22,702 --> 01:11:23,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, take care, Ranma.

1178
01:11:24,402 --> 01:11:25,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, bye.

1179
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:26,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1180
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:30,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop distracting this show with your flying penises.

1181
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:31,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Fonz Radio.

1182
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:32,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1183
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,227
[SPEAKER_13]: It's GS68.

1184
01:11:35,307 --> 01:11:36,928
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68, what is on your mind, my friend?

1185
01:11:36,968 --> 01:11:38,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a flying penis?

1186
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:38,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

1187
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:39,429
[SPEAKER_13]: It's anime.

1188
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, are you at Fonime right now?

1189
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:43,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1190
01:11:43,611 --> 01:11:46,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you gotta get some noise.

1191
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you in the middle of a crowd or something?

1192
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:49,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1193
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, no, I'm in the main area.

1194
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:54,974
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in the main area?

1195
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:56,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there like tons of people walking through there?

1196
01:11:57,716 --> 01:12:00,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Over by the hall with the meeting rooms.

1197
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:03,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, make a beeline to the vendor hall and make some noise for Orange Challenge Radio.

1198
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you gotta make some noise for Orange Challenge Radio.

1199
01:12:05,282 --> 01:12:05,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that's alright.

1200
01:12:05,842 --> 01:12:08,024
[SPEAKER_13]: What, what, um, what, how's it going this year?

1201
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:08,724
[SPEAKER_13]: How is Fandomay?

1202
01:12:08,744 --> 01:12:09,525
[SPEAKER_13]: What are we missing out on?

1203
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:13,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, um, let's see.

1204
01:12:14,849 --> 01:12:18,652
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a gaming room and a dealer's room, for better or for worse.

1205
01:12:19,273 --> 01:12:19,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1206
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:26,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Have there been any awesome panels this year to make up for the loss of Orange Lounge Radio?

1207
01:12:47,722 --> 01:13:05,693
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Banzai Arcade, which is basically a game show where you have a video game trigger and sometimes you're challenged to do a fantastic video game like 25 rings inside the hedgehog or beat the final boss of Sonic 2.

1208
01:13:07,975 --> 01:13:08,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

1209
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:12,317
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like you're having fun.

1210
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:15,159
[SPEAKER_13]: What are some of the craziest cosplays you've seen while you've been there?

1211
01:13:16,876 --> 01:13:17,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1212
01:13:19,238 --> 01:13:19,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me think.

1213
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:25,562
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this one mecha cosplay.

1214
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:29,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot his name, but he had some lights on his outfit.

1215
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:30,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.

1216
01:13:33,026 --> 01:13:36,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the hentai room for the heck of it.

1217
01:13:37,129 --> 01:13:37,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.

1218
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, usually, I was doing, like, handshakes, and people were like...

1219
01:13:46,203 --> 01:13:50,907
[SPEAKER_03]: and the freaking stuff they were showing.

1220
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:56,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it sounds like you're having fun and you're going to continue to throughout the rest of the weekend.

1221
01:13:56,352 --> 01:14:01,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sorry we didn't make it this year, but are there any OLR listeners that you've run into?

1222
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:06,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I appear to be the only one that I know of.

1223
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:07,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Aw, sadness.

1224
01:14:07,821 --> 01:14:09,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the staff listens to our show.

1225
01:14:09,423 --> 01:14:10,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they do.

1226
01:14:10,664 --> 01:14:11,745
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all closet fans.

1227
01:14:11,765 --> 01:14:11,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1228
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:18,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the grassroots effort to get the ULR name out there.

1229
01:14:18,904 --> 01:14:19,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well done.

1230
01:14:19,745 --> 01:14:19,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1231
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:47,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I also had a Yoda over Circle Flasher logo, right?

1232
01:14:47,343 --> 01:14:47,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1233
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think first day I had it in my back shoulder because I got an oversized back shoulder.

1234
01:14:55,348 --> 01:14:58,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it's big enough to carry a little card under my badge.

1235
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:00,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, very cool.

1236
01:15:00,731 --> 01:15:05,413
[SPEAKER_13]: We should make little somethings for people that go to anime conventions.

1237
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:08,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, I should look into that, like little stickers or something people can wear.

1238
01:15:08,094 --> 01:15:11,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I was outside to check out the anime masquerade last night.

1239
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:12,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really like it.

1240
01:15:12,837 --> 01:15:14,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, a lot of kids, like...

1241
01:15:15,798 --> 01:15:26,084
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried too hard with the voice acting so it ends up sounding cheesy and horrible and there are too many like dance skits like too many people doing that freaking har har yukai dance.

1242
01:15:26,164 --> 01:15:27,885
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean... It's still good.

1243
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:30,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose.

1244
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:40,732
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're pretty awesome Mortal Versus Capcom skits where they replicated one of the... I think we used Shinko Hadouken Attack.

1245
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:43,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they replicated that with like...

1246
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,875
[SPEAKER_03]: and Wallace Delafade, which was pretty awesome.

1247
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a laser, I guess.

1248
01:15:51,943 --> 01:15:53,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Mel B, our buddy Mel B, our buddy

1249
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really know him.

1250
01:16:23,221 --> 01:16:24,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, he knows OLR.

1251
01:16:25,743 --> 01:16:26,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I see.

1252
01:16:26,383 --> 01:16:26,683
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1253
01:16:27,024 --> 01:16:29,265
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls, but have fun.

1254
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:29,665
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1255
01:16:29,765 --> 01:16:31,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Run around, act crazy.

1256
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:32,687
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1257
01:16:33,628 --> 01:16:34,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

1258
01:16:34,068 --> 01:16:34,609
[SPEAKER_13]: See you around.

1259
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:36,890
[SPEAKER_13]: A call direct from Faname.

1260
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:37,751
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of cool.

1261
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:40,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I like these whole little live reports we're getting.

1262

[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's awesome.

1268
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:01,194

01:17:14,002 --> 01:17:41,404

[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1288
01:18:28,735 --> 01:18:33,238
[SPEAKER_11]: There's apparently another WiiWare game that's coming, I guess, pretty soon.

1289
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:34,459
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

1290
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:45,125
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a WiiWare game called Last Flight, and apparently the game has to do with vampires on a plane.

1291
01:18:46,482 --> 01:18:49,284
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess you are a culinary vampire hunter.

1292
01:18:50,784 --> 01:18:51,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Culinary vampire hunter.

1293
01:18:51,865 --> 01:19:02,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Players will have the option of playing, I guess, Anna, a Romanian who is on the same plane back to Europe and is on a mission to destroy her vampire father.

1294
01:19:03,551 --> 01:19:03,932
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

[SPEAKER_13]: I did miss Asen.

1301
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:17,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kind of sad, but I definitely want to go next year.

1302
01:19:17,323 --> 01:19:18,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, who is this?

1303
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:19,744
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Osfer.

1304
01:19:20,165 --> 01:19:20,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Osfer.

1305
01:19:20,865 --> 01:19:22,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how was Asen?

1306
01:19:22,086 --> 01:19:23,487
[SPEAKER_13]: We just had a report on Faname.

1307
01:19:23,527 --> 01:19:24,147
[SPEAKER_13]: How was Asen?

1308
01:19:26,168 --> 01:19:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was my very first convention, and it was a freaking blast.

1309
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:31,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh.

1310
01:19:32,672 --> 01:19:36,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Well... If you went to Artist Alley, you would have run into our official lesbians.

1311
01:19:38,016 --> 01:19:41,398
[SPEAKER_13]: If you saw two girls, one with blue hair, you would have ran into them.

1312
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:42,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, crap.

1313
01:19:42,888 --> 01:19:43,448
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta have blue hair.

1314
01:19:43,468 --> 01:19:44,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember.

1315
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:44,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I had orange hair.

1316
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:45,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, wait here.

1317
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:46,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll post a link in chat so I have the pictures from it.

1318
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:46,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Misty.

1319
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:11,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was in line for the Hal Kelly concert, and she walked by and she had her Pikachu hat on.

1320
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, hey, but she couldn't stick around because she didn't want to hold up the line.

1321
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:15,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1322
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's still pretty cool.

1323
01:20:17,441 --> 01:20:21,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my gosh, there's like an entire album of stuff.

1324
01:20:21,304 --> 01:20:23,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some of them are videos, too.

1325
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:25,748
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is me with my orange hair on.

1326
01:20:25,768 --> 01:20:27,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing part of the Har Har Yukai dance.

1327
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:29,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, are you dressed up as someone?

1328
01:20:31,013 --> 01:20:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1329
01:20:32,116 --> 01:20:37,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in one of them, I'm supposed to be Ichigo, but I didn't get the full outfit, so I'm just supposed to be him in a school uniform.

1330
01:20:39,282 --> 01:20:46,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in another one, I'm standing next to my friend, who he was cosplaying Kenshin, and I'm supposed to be Kion from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

1331
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:46,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh.

1332
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:48,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to figure out if this is you.

1333
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:53,534
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to look at the pictures here.

1334
01:20:53,614 --> 01:20:54,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, that looks like orangey hair.

1335
01:20:55,135 --> 01:20:56,096
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably him right there.

1336
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:56,736
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1337
01:20:57,697 --> 01:20:58,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.

1338
01:20:58,278 --> 01:20:59,439
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like you have fun.

1339
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:01,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there just like tons and tons of people there?

1340
01:21:03,339 --> 01:21:04,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

1341
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that like the fourth biggest convention in the United States or something like that?

1342
01:21:08,022 --> 01:21:09,403
[SPEAKER_13]: That is an awesome Pyramid Head outfit.

1343
01:21:09,423 --> 01:21:09,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at that.

1344
01:21:10,004 --> 01:21:10,404
[SPEAKER_13]: That's hot.

1345
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:12,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see that Pyramid Head cosplay?

1346
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:13,927
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you're looking at the same one.

1347
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:14,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked at the pictures earlier.

1348
01:21:15,147 --> 01:21:16,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, very hot.

1349
01:21:16,969 --> 01:21:19,751
[SPEAKER_13]: So, what gaming related things did you see there real quick?

1350
01:21:22,152 --> 01:21:26,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't really get to play much because there was like huge lines for all the games.

1351
01:21:26,996 --> 01:21:31,359
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, of course, there was like a huge station with all these like classic fighters like Street Fighter and just like

1352
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,461
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes on and on.

1353
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:34,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's Brawl, of course.

1354
01:21:36,342 --> 01:21:40,083
[SPEAKER_05]: For the arcade stuff, they had Beatmania 6 style, I think.

1355
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they have the new one, Gold.

1356
01:21:44,784 --> 01:21:48,665
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't really get to play that because something was wrong with the 6 mix machine.

1357
01:21:48,705 --> 01:21:50,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it in my quarters and they ripped me off.

1358
01:21:50,525 --> 01:21:51,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, dang it.

1359
01:21:52,445 --> 01:21:55,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had an in-the-group 2 machine.

1360
01:21:55,706 --> 01:21:59,467
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it had R21 or something because...

1361
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,123
[SPEAKER_05]: It had this whole opening preview video.

1362
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:03,904
[SPEAKER_05]: It said over 4,500 songs.

1363
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:05,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, holy shit.

1364
01:22:05,444 --> 01:22:08,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, somebody probably installed a hack on it.

1365
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1366
01:22:10,005 --> 01:22:12,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Something, but oh my God, it was huge.

1367
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:14,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they had DDR Extreme, Pump It Up.

1368
01:22:16,067 --> 01:22:16,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1369
01:22:17,327 --> 01:22:18,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like fun.

1370
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:25,009
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, buddy, we're going to let you go, but I'm glad to hear your first con was a success, and yeah, we'll try to make it next year.

1371
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:26,529
[SPEAKER_13]: We definitely want to have a panel and all that.

1372
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:29,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't know if we can all go, but those of us that can, we'll do something, so

1373
01:22:31,004 --> 01:22:33,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm already planning to go to OhioCon next.

1374
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:34,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

1375
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:35,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, now you're addicted.

1376
01:22:35,265 --> 01:22:36,006
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, have fun.

1377
01:22:36,026 --> 01:22:37,706
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, thanks.

1378
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:38,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

1379
01:22:38,307 --> 01:22:40,707
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1380
01:22:40,727 --> 01:22:41,808
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to start wrapping up the show.

1381
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:43,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other last-minute stories, Loki?

1382
01:22:43,548 --> 01:22:44,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1383
01:22:44,589 --> 01:22:44,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1384
01:22:45,049 --> 01:22:53,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than the vampires on the plane stuff, there is a certain game that is being rumored to coming out in August.

1385
01:22:54,272 --> 01:22:56,733
[SPEAKER_11]: It also begins with an A. The game...

1386
01:22:58,763 --> 01:23:01,965
[SPEAKER_11]: is rumored to be coming to stores in August.

1387
01:23:02,165 --> 01:23:06,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently this is coming from PlayAsia, who has the game listed for August 28th.

1388
01:23:07,847 --> 01:23:15,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently they got the date early before on Initial D's special stage, so they're saying maybe it's possible.

1389
01:23:18,072 --> 01:23:19,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard anything, so I don't know.

1390
01:23:20,113 --> 01:23:20,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

1391
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:51,689
[SPEAKER_11]: and then for those of you who emulate your games on your PC EPSXE 1.70 has finally been released after about 4 years of no updates there and now they've added a bunch of support now multiple changes done to the pad support some more ISO support code being rewritten and apparently a lot more games are now compatible with it so that's pretty cool

1392
01:23:52,929 --> 01:24:13,295
[SPEAKER_11]: and let's see here I was going to say also there's a website the slobsofgaming.com they have since we're talking about anime conventions here the 11 most scorching hot female cosplayers ever and you can check that out slobsofgaming.com and I'll copy that in the chat room as well

1393
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:29,121
[SPEAKER_11]: and let's see Duke Nukem 3D has now been converted to work on the PSP Slim so if you have your PSP Slim hacked in with homebrew ready software running on it you can now play Duke Nukem 3D which is pretty awesome

1394
01:24:31,795 --> 01:24:58,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Infinite Undiscovery, the Square Enix game coming out on the Xbox 360 has been announced for a worldwide release on September 2nd so that looks pretty cool and Sam & Max Season 3 are going to be coming early 2009 Telltale is still interested in putting the games out on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network so hopefully we'll see those soon and I don't remember if we mentioned this earlier but

1395
01:24:59,775 --> 01:25:00,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Carameldansen

1396
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:32,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Pack there, you get Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, Just What I Needed, I'm In Touch With Your World, Don't Just Stop, You're All I've Got, Bye Bye Love, Moving in Stereo, and All Mixed Up.

1397
01:25:33,548 --> 01:25:33,988
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it.

1398
01:25:35,389 --> 01:25:43,934
[SPEAKER_09]: About the Actraiser thing too, it was just basically, he's criticizing, I'd like to make an Actraiser sequel, that would be kind of fun.

1399
01:25:45,135 --> 01:25:46,296
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be fun, do it.

1400
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:47,356
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super fun.

1401
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:48,637
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be a lot of fun.

1402
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:52,707
[SPEAKER_09]: It came up when discussing WiiWare stuff.

1403
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:53,888
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I hope it's true.

1404
01:25:54,988 --> 01:25:57,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we're going to put the nail in the coffin of this show now.

1405
01:25:57,828 --> 01:25:59,769
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1406
01:25:59,809 --> 01:26:04,730
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, Tiara, thank you so much for being here tonight and being a presence here on the show.

1408
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:07,170

[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you doing anything exciting before you leave?

1410
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:15,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here until Tuesday night, so I'm sure we'll get into other fun shenanigans before then.

1411
01:26:15,191 --> 01:26:16,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay, shenanigans.

1412
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:16,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Any final thought?

1413
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Stark built it in a cave.

1414
01:26:20,131 --> 01:26:20,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Hot.

1415
01:26:21,372 --> 01:26:27,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew Nami, thank you for being here tonight and lending your, I would say whip, but that doesn't really work.

1416

[SPEAKER_13]: So lending you to this show.

1417
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,178

01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:41,625
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1422
01:26:42,825 --> 01:26:43,166

[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1428
01:26:50,495 --> 01:26:50,695
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1429
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:55,377
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is two final thoughts because I'm special.

1430
01:26:55,397 --> 01:26:55,898
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you get one.

1431
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:59,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's the same thought then for two people.

1432
01:26:59,099 --> 01:26:59,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine.

1433
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:00,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, I win.

1434
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:04,782
[SPEAKER_09]: A double happy birthday, first of all, to Tiara.

1435
01:27:05,662 --> 01:27:06,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1436
01:27:06,923 --> 01:27:09,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And to DJ Ranma S. All right.

1437
01:27:09,784 --> 01:27:10,484
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a busy month.

1438
01:27:10,744 --> 01:27:11,505
[SPEAKER_09]: For being an old man.

1439
01:27:12,225 --> 01:27:13,366
[SPEAKER_12]: I have one more final thought.

1440
01:27:13,626 --> 01:27:14,186
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1441
01:27:15,226 --> 01:27:16,187
[SPEAKER_12]: You just lost the game.

1442
01:27:16,957 --> 01:27:17,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

1443
01:27:17,877 --> 01:27:18,217
