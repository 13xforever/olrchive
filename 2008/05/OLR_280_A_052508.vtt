Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, May 25th, 2008. Is Killer Instinct going to make a comeback?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
A new computer chip promises to end piracy forever.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And will the 360 go without an update this spring?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
And yeah, we were out last week so we didn't have a show and part B from the week before took forever to get to the podcast feed.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
But it's all better now, all better. We're fixed and ready to go.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'm ready to go tonight.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Hopefully the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also ready to go tonight.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hi.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Are you well oiled and ready to go?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
You know, like a machine.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I've had a hamburger, does that count?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Sure, that works.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Okay, then I'm well greased and ready to go to the bathroom.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Alright, sounds not hot.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Alright, also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Hello.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
And are you well oiled and ready to go?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Uh, sure.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, you had a Subway sandwich earlier, so I know. How long was that Subway sandwich?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That was like a two foot long sandwich.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
It was a foot long, okay, and it was with the wrong bread because apparently this Subway was out of white bread.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
That sandwich was bigger than my foot.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
That was not a foot long sandwich, that was a foot long sandwich.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Alright, anyhow, sorry.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
We are turning into Orange Lounge Foodio yet again.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Alright, joining us as well in studio, we have some guests tonight, which is good because we haven't had a lot of guests recently.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
And I've had to suffer this entire show with only Jamie and Matt.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
However, we have some guests tonight to help break that up a little bit.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Joining us all the way from Las Vegas is Tiara.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
How are you?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I can has American cheeseburger.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Yes, you can has American cheeseburger. How are you doing?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
I am very good. I got nauseous on the way here, but now I'm fine.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Sorry to hear that. You are very, very quiet. They're having a hard time hearing you, so don't be afraid to get that thing real close to your mouth.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Because remember, it's normally wired for Jamie, who can get kind of loud.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Alright, yeah, that's right.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm just teasing.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Alright, well we're glad to have you. So you feel free to chime in whenever. Take Jamie's mic, I encourage it.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Just kidding.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know why I'm giving Jamie a hard time tonight. I heart Jamie. She knows that.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Right, you know that?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm going to throw that ferret in the fire.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Drewnami.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Rawr.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
How are you doing, Drew?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm Rawr.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You're Rawr?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Rawr.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I like the interactive radio that was going on before the show, by the way.

02:50.000 --> 03:02.000
Here's what happened. We're live on Justin TV. We do our cam thing, although I got to tell you, the cam kind of sucks tonight because I dropped the iSight webcam and the audio doesn't work anymore.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
It's not breaking it, Drew.

03:03.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, it's having to use the actual audio from that little tiny mic thing on the actual, like if you look at the right side of the Mac, but you can see the little tiny mic thing, that's what it's using.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So our Justin TV is kind of hurting tonight.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
But I guess one of our listeners actually saw that you were here and called your phone and got you to leave the room.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Ranma, you fucking suck. I just like to make that known.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
But Orange Launch Radio is interactive radio. It's the best thing ever because we get to interact with you guys. We love it.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
And you can join us in chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, or our chat channel is Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Or you can always send us emails, mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
I think we have a pretty full mailbag tonight, though, because it's been two weeks, so you may not want to send them just yet.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Wait till during the week.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
And also our Skype line, which will be open later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
But it would not be Orange Lounge Radio if we didn't talk about our gaming week.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
And since we've got some time to catch up on, tonight's question is how is your gaming two weeks?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
So Dark Sakura, how is your gaming two weeks?

04:04.000 --> 04:16.000
We played Rock Band today, and I played pinball a lot. I went to Pin-A-Go-Go the weekend before.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
How was Pin-A-Go-Go? Because we didn't get to hear about it because we were out that week.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
It was hot, smelly, and hot. And smelly.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Do pinball players not bathe or something?

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
I don't know, but this was at Dixon Farm Center of something or the other with Banquet Hall.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, when most people call Sacramento a cow town, you're actually probably thinking of Dixon.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Moo.

04:41.000 --> 04:54.000
Anyway, but I did get to play the Black Rose before it went down, and Dan brought his No Fear, and Will brought Judge Dredd, which is not my favorite table.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
But anyway, I really played. I tried to go back and play some really old stuff and some things I hadn't seen before, but I could not get on Theater of Magic at all.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And no one brought like a medieval madness. There was an Addams Family there.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Nice.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
But it was by this point, it's a lot of machines that I know if I want to play them, we know the people who own them.

05:15.000 --> 05:23.000
So what exactly happens at Pin-A-Go-Go? You pay money to get in and just play all the pinball you want, or is it more of like it's supposed to be like a trade show for pinball enthusiasts?

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
You've got your center area, which is all, in fact, there's actually two rooms.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
The main room is where the newer tables are set up, the one with more, you know, I guess componentry and things.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
And then there's an air conditioned dining hall that has older machines set up in there.

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
And I'm talking like, you know, 60s, you know, 50s, 60s, 70s machines.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
But you basically, they're all put on free play and you pay your convention dues and you run around and, you know.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Frolick.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Frolick in the hot.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Play pinball.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
But around the sides they have vendors set up.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
People who sell, you know, old tables that need some work, like a friend of ours got a Space Invaders pinball.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Nice.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
For like 150 bucks. It needs to be shopped really bad.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Does it have the groovy music from the new soundtrack?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't know.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It should.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Probably not.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
It's old.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, probably not then.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And creepy looking too.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
There are a couple of machines I did play quite a bit of.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Did they have the Jurassic Park pinball?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
That was one of my favorites because the dinosaur would come down and eat the ball.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
No.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
That was always my favorite.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
It had a fun house, which I hate because that head scares me.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
But it had Captain Fantastic.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Captain Fantastic.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Which is the one with Elton John on it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
That was the machine in Tommy.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh yeah, he's fantastic, alright.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I have a picture of it. I'll put it on the camera.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Fantastic.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
But I did play, one of my favorite was Black Hole.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
Which, the cool thing about Black Hole is that you have an underside that you play under the field and you play it reversed.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh, I've seen something like that.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't think it was, I think it was like, isn't there a swamp thing or a creature from the swamp or something like that?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
An Elvira machine does it.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay, okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
But Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is what's in my house, just has a hologram of the creature.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay, no, I'm thinking of something else. Alright, that's fine.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
But, um, Black Hole is a pretty, pretty nifty machine.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
But, um, Dan finally got to play Black Rose, which is the one I want.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Which I think is much cooler than the new Pirates of the Caribbean game.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Which was there.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And Family Guy and Simpsons Pinball Party, which I have.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And no pin bot.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
You know what?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
There's a bride.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You know what pinball game I haven't played in forever that I want to play again?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Well.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Revenge of the Gator.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
That was the Game Boy one.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I know.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
That was the first game I ever played with the link cable.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
That one was fantabulous.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
It was fantabulous.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
But it was, overall it was a really good convention, but we ended up splitting so that we could go to, um, Mary's Pizza Shack.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Nice.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Where we didn't eat pizza.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
We ate breadsticks.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
And I had a milkshake.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
The end.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Alright.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Loki, how was your gaming two weeks?

08:03.000 --> 08:12.000
Um, well, week one I played pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto IV, because I was attempting to go for 100% by that deadline.

08:12.000 --> 08:21.000
And, not to say that I didn't try, because I took two days off work, played solid for four days, and still didn't finish it in time.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Um, it just got to the point where it wasn't even fun to play it anymore.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
It's fun to play it now though, but not fun to just do all the side missions and stuff.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And I'm still going to do 100% eventually.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
It's just, you know, right now I'm like at 86.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
So, I have to kill all the pigeons.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And do stunts and stuff like that.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Uh, then I played a little bit of, um, Wii Fit this week.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
And that's alright.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
You know, the balance board, it's not as fun as you would think it would be.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
It really, it, I don't know.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
It's just kind of stupid, some of the games that are on there.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And they're not really responsive.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But, whatever.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
And then, um, I tried a little bit of, um, the Penny Arcade game.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
And that was pretty fun.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Wait, I have to ask, when you got on the balance board, did it go, ow!

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
No, it didn't go, ow.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
It's all, you're obese.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Did your wife make fun of you? Was she watching you play?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
No, she was watching me play with you.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It was just fun.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Um, but then, you know, the, uh, it said my Wii Fit age was 38.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
So, I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Um, tried, like, a bunch of the mini games on there.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Like, the jogging and stuff.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
There's, um, apparently, uh, Xtifer and my wife said that, um,

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
the female trainer on there has a giant bulge.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Like, she's got a package.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What?

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, apparently the female trainer is carrying, uh, some extra, uh, equipment.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I don't know. Kind of weird stuff there.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
But, um, yeah, pretty much that was my gaming week.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Because that's all I've been really playing.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Um, multiplayer's still kind of fun.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
It's hit and miss, though, with the accuracy on it.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Because, you know, you'll be aiming at someone's head.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And, for whatever reason, it really favors if you crouch down when you're firing and stuff.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I don't know. It's just kind of cheap.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It's not as fun as you would have hoped it.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
But it's not as broken as the PSP version.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
So, that's also fun.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Um, but, yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I'm still trying to get my audio video set up to work so I can, um, record some funny stuff.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Because I was, um, I was doing some...

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
We were playing with some people and there's a, you know, a bunch of skate parks in there.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
And you can take the motorcycles on the half pipes and stuff and do funny things with that.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Um, just all sorts of weird stuff.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, my gaming week, um, you know, I was kind of sick last week.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Which you would think I would stay home and play games all day, but I really didn't.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Although, I did, um, you know, it's...

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Gosh, it's been a while since we've had a show.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I mean, you miss a week, miss a lot.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Because we haven't done a show since WiiWare came out.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Like, that was, like, our last show was, what, May 11th?

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And so, literally the next day was when WiiWare came out.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
So, I checked out Defend Your Castle because I'd played the Flash game a long time ago and I loved it.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So, I decided to get the version for the Wii.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
And it's cute. Like, I love the graphics and the sound are hilarious.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Because, um, they made all the graphics out of really quirky things.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Like, um, for one of the battering rams that some of the guys try to use on your castle.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
There's little popsicle sticks that they use as the art.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
And, like, these giant monsters are made of Pepsi caps.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Like, the tops of, like, actual Pepsi bottles.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Which is, um, kind of funny.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So, um...

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, so that was, uh, that was...

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
It was amusing. Defend Your Castle is very amusing.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It's very slow in the beginning.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Like, you kind of have to stick with it for it to get really chaotic.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
And the kind of bummer thing about Defend Your Castle is that once you've kind of upgraded your castle fully,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
there's not really a lot left to do.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
You just have to let it keep getting faster and faster and faster.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But, it's only a $5 game.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
And, you know, compared to some of the $5 stinkers on Xbox Live,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
it's, it's, it's... $5 is a fair price for the game.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I think it would be a fun party game, too, and it's obscenely simple.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I mean, it's cool to bring friends over and be all,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
okay, here's what you do, pick up the guys with your controller,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
and then throw them up in the air and watch them die.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I mean, that's... What fun is that?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
An instant party, just add death.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Uh, so, yeah, Defend Your Castle is kind of cool.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Um, it's not a game that's going to amuse you on a long-term basis.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
So, though, if you're, if you're kind of like a single player looking for some games that are going to keep you involved for a long time,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
from what I understand, you should probably go with Lost Winds or the, uh, Final Fantasy game.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Uh, neither of which I've checked out yet because I'm out of space on my Wii drive.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I, I know that.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Completely out of space.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It doesn't take much.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Jeez.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
So, but anyway, I'll save that bitching for another day.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Uh, otherwise, I did check out the Penny Arcade game for a little bit.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I only checked out the demo, so I'm not going to try to give a full review of the game.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
But I did laugh my ass off, like, I thought the game was very amusing.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
The gameplay itself, you know, eh, I've seen it before, but I, I was amused.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And I'm sure fans of the comic are going to be insanely amused.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Um, I hear it's short, but you know what?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
How much does it cost to see a movie these days?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Like, ten bucks to go see a movie for ninety minutes?

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
You know, it makes twenty dollars for four hours of entertainment not seem so bad.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
So, you know, I, I'm sure this game is, I, I am going to put down the money to buy it when I have a little more time to actually sit down and play it.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Um, otherwise, I've just pretty much been playing WoW.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I have a friend who's trying very hard to get me to play Age of Conan.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
But, from what I understand, it's still crashing.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Like, he's getting the blue screen of death when he's playing.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
And I'm like, dude, I haven't heard of anyone getting the Windows blue screen of death in like five years.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
So that's pretty hardcore.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Um, so I'll check that out once it gets a little more stable.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Because you remember when WoW first came out?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
They had issues too.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I mean, WoW was shutting down systems left and right as well.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So, uh, yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
So that's that.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
So, uh, otherwise, other games I've played, um, not a lot of new stuff.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I went back and played some old retro stuff.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Some old Xbox Live arcade games.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
That's really it.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Um, Tiara, I see you're playing a PSP right now.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
What are you, what are you up to?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
How was your gaming weeks?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
What have you been playing?

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Um, well, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
It's kind of interesting because I've played the PSX version through so many times.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
And it's interesting to see how they've rewritten, like, the script and everything.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Is it supposed to be, like, an upgrade of the original PlayStation 1?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Or is it, like, a whole new story?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Because I never really understood.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
This one is the exact same game.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
They've, uh, redone the translation.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
And now everybody talks like Thor from Marvel Comics.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Okay.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
And, um, they have, like, some of the cut scenes are now animated.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So it's, you know, it's kind of interesting.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Cool.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Those cameos.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yes.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And, um, there are two new classes that you can get.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Onion Knight and Dark Knight.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And so it's been pretty interesting so far.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm only in the third chapter.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
But so far everything is pretty much the same.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
The translation is slightly different.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And so since the text is different, I'm sort of thrown off by it.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
Because I'm so used to seeing the cheesy, uh, old translation.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
That was like when I played Final Fantasy IV on the Game Boy Advance for the first time.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I was like, whoa, whoa, this is way different from what I remember on Super Nintendo.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Because they really dumbed it down on Super Nintendo.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
But thank heavens they kept you Spoonie Bard in there.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I was like, I had to play at least to that spot to see, like, did they keep Spoonie Bard?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yes?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Okay.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Other than that, um, I bought myself Iron Man for the PSP.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
And I've been playing that a little bit.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I actually wrote a review for that.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
And it's in the mailbag.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
So I'm sure Jamie will read it later.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Nice.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
And other than that, that's it.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
All right.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
I notice your PSP is very shiny, by the way.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You take good care of that PSP, don't you?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You, like, you sign on that or something.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
It's very, very well kept.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah, it's, well, I just got it last month.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
That's why.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Ah, okay.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
Because, um, it was, uh, like a kind of preemptive tax refund gift to myself.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Like, I know the government's giving me $600, so why not?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Exactly.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
And then I have, like, my little shield on it.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
And so it's, you know, that's why it's shiny.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Very nice.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Isn't it shiny?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yes.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's one thing I noticed about the PSP.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
All right.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's shiny.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Shiny.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
All right.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Drew, anything shiny in your gaming week?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Not particularly.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I've been playing, uh, well, I played some rock band today.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Did okay, I think.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Um, other than that, not much.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
I tinkered with La Mulana, but, uh, I guess I'm just that, not that hardcore anymore.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Okay.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Somebody needs to explain La Mulana with me because I know, I know we have tons of chatters

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
that are obsessed with this game and, like, have been trying to get me to play.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
So sell me on La Mulana.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
What's, what's so rad about it?

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
In a nutshell, it's like a recreation of an MSX game.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Obscenely difficult.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
It's, uh, action adventure.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
And basically the goal is you're like this Indiana Jones type archeologist, and you want

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
to, uh, discover all the secrets in the ancient city called La Mulana.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.800
Unfortunately, almost everything is a trap.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.800
It's not, I don't, it's not, uh, I want to be the guy hard, but it's, it's definitely

17:35.800 --> 17:36.800
Battletoads hard.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.380
That would be a great name for a game.

17:39.380 --> 17:43.380
Everything is a trap.

17:43.380 --> 17:44.520
I'm not sure how that works.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.120
I'm not sure if that would be like, I don't know if you ever saw the movie cube like that

17:48.120 --> 17:49.120
as a video game.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.800
We were just discussing this earlier today.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.400
Hypercube breaks my mind.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
Everything is a trap.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.600
It's a trap.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.600
I like that.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
That's a good name.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.240
I like, I'm not sure.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
Add that to our wishlist.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.240
Well, I don't know.

18:03.240 --> 18:07.240
I don't know if it's able to add to the OLR wishlist because I'm not sure what the game

18:07.240 --> 18:08.800
is yet.

18:08.800 --> 18:09.880
That's the point.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.880
You don't know what it is.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.880
Oh, because it's a trap.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.880
Okay.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.880
Okay.

18:15.880 --> 18:16.880
Yeah.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.880
Then I approve.

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
It can go on the OLR wishlist.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
Oh my God.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.760
I've actually been playing through Metal Gear Solid 2.

18:21.760 --> 18:26.200
I sort of gave up on the game a couple of years ago cause I suck at stealth games and

18:26.200 --> 18:28.960
now I find I'm actually progressing.

18:28.960 --> 18:33.640
Maybe it's the fact that I'm now playing on very easy, but Raiden is not annoying as I

18:33.640 --> 18:36.880
thought it would be.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.880
It's kind of interesting.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.160
Isn't it weird when you like rediscover games that were out like five years ago?

18:41.160 --> 18:42.160
Yeah.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.160
Yeah.

18:43.160 --> 18:48.120
Like, or like 10 years ago in the case when I was really sick and I was at my parents,

18:48.120 --> 18:49.680
I was playing Soul Blazer.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.680
Oh God.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.680
Soul Blazer is awesome.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.680
Soul Blazer is awesome.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.400
Soul Blazer needs to come to Virtual Console for reals.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.240
Like I don't think this made our show roll tonight, but I understand there was a little,

18:58.240 --> 19:03.360
there was a little bit of shenanigans on the internet this week because I guess Kotaku

19:03.360 --> 19:10.960
had posted, we want this game, we want Soul Blazer to come to Virtual Console and somehow

19:10.960 --> 19:16.640
that got reported like on like G4 as Soul Blazer is on Virtual Console.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.640
That was kind of funny.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.080
That was very funny, but I agree with the guy who wrote it.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.600
Soul Blazer does need to come to Virtual Console as does Illusion of Gaia, as does Terranigma.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.520
Thank you very much.

19:27.520 --> 19:32.080
Are you going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4 at some point, Junami, and the 50 hour cut

19:32.080 --> 19:34.080
scenes are supposed to be in the game?

19:34.080 --> 19:35.080
Yeah.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.080
If I can afford a PS3.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
Are you going to be watching Metal Gear Solid?

19:37.080 --> 19:39.400
I shouldn't, I shouldn't ask people if they're going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.880
It's just as are you going to be watching it?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.240
No, I'll be busy watching Xenosaga.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.240
Oh, okay.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.360
Of course, then again, when Final Fantasy 13 comes out, I'm sure it's going to be no

19:48.360 --> 19:51.120
different where you just, you're going to be watching it.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.760
I'll, I'll stick to my Tales of games for now.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.680
I'm stoked for the Tales of Symphonia sequel for Wii.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.760
My roommate who occasionally gets into games, like he was like obsessed with Puzzle Quest

20:01.760 --> 20:03.840
for a little while and stuff like that, he loves Final Fantasy.

20:03.840 --> 20:04.840
He'll touch anything that says Final Fantasy.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.920
He was just asking me the other day, when's Final Fantasy 13 coming out?

20:07.920 --> 20:09.600
Because like apparently I know everything about video games.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.160
I'm like, um, 2010, if you're lucky.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.200
If you're in Japan, you might see it next year.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.200
Yeah.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.200
Anyhow.

20:18.200 --> 20:24.000
All right, let's get to gaming news after we take care of some housekeeping tonight.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.600
First off, sorry about last week, we weren't here and that, uh, we decided we were going

20:27.600 --> 20:32.820
to put out part B of the May 11th show a little late just to kind of spread it out when we

20:32.820 --> 20:35.400
realized there wasn't gonna be a show this next, last week.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.560
But then it ended up getting out really, really late and that was my bad.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.560
So sorry about that.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.360
This is up now, parts A and B of last week's show.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.880
Grand Theft Auto IV contest.

20:44.880 --> 20:50.560
If you listen to last week's show, you know that SSJ 100 Matt won our nomination into

20:50.560 --> 20:52.760
the finals for the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.440
I don't know who won yet.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.200
What I can tell you is that it was, it didn't end up being a public vote.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.020
That's not how they did it.

21:00.020 --> 21:05.060
Each show that participated got a vote in the competition.

21:05.060 --> 21:09.360
So in other words, we got to vote for any show that wasn't our own, basically.

21:09.360 --> 21:14.840
And so the show that gets the most votes, that listener will win the super duper rare

21:14.840 --> 21:16.520
Xbox 360 elite.

21:16.520 --> 21:21.760
I can tell you that after much deliberation, and the three of us did this last week because

21:21.760 --> 21:25.660
we didn't have a show, we made our top three list independently and it was so funny because

21:25.660 --> 21:29.160
everything was like all around the board.

21:29.160 --> 21:35.120
Like I don't, I don't think any of us had like any similarities in our list whatsoever.

21:35.120 --> 21:40.520
Like Dark Sakura, I think had the Chatterbox show on her list, and Loki had the one with

21:40.520 --> 21:42.340
all the dick jokes on his list.

21:42.340 --> 21:43.340
Which one was that?

21:43.340 --> 21:44.340
Was that the platform nation one?

21:44.340 --> 21:45.340
Why am I not surprised?

21:45.340 --> 21:46.920
That's because it was the most like a Grand Theft Auto commercial.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.920
No, no.

21:47.920 --> 21:48.920
I know it was.

21:48.920 --> 21:49.920
And what did I have?

21:49.920 --> 21:53.840
I had, I had video game outsiders on my list.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.060
I remember that.

21:55.060 --> 22:01.800
But in the end, the only one that actually ended up on all three of our lists was the

22:01.800 --> 22:03.000
All Games Interactive one.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.200
So that's what we ended up voting for.

22:05.200 --> 22:10.860
And I don't have the MP3 handy, but it's really great because what they did is they cropped

22:10.860 --> 22:13.240
Mary Young, who's on that show.

22:13.240 --> 22:17.920
I guess he was like, he was having one of those, I'm all alone on the radio.

22:17.920 --> 22:24.000
Like did you ever see Wayne's World when Garth was all alone having to do the show?

22:24.000 --> 22:28.300
I guess Mary Young was having one of those moments and somebody actually remixed it to

22:28.300 --> 22:31.200
music and it's hilarious.

22:31.200 --> 22:36.720
He's actually singing like, I am alone on the feed.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.720
It was really funny.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.720
Oh wait, look, I found it.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.720
I found it.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.720
Okay.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.720
Here's the one we voted for to win.

22:41.720 --> 23:11.560
All right, I'm not going to play the whole thing.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.040
You can listen to their show if you want to hear the whole thing, but it was really funny.

23:14.040 --> 23:18.360
So we voted for it, even though nowhere in there do they ever say it's All Games Interactive

23:18.360 --> 23:19.360
or any of that.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.400
And it really has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto, but it was funny.

23:22.400 --> 23:28.240
You ever seen that movie Shocker right before the guy's head exploded?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.840
I do know, I don't think we've gotten a single vote so far.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.840
Poor Matt.

23:32.840 --> 23:37.560
The problem is if it had been, see, we kind of got screwed by how they decided to do the

23:37.560 --> 23:40.720
finals, which is fine because we didn't know how they were going to do it going into it.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.920
We knew it could be anything, but with a public vote, at least we could have mobilized the

23:44.920 --> 23:45.920
OL army.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.260
And I think Matt would have done pretty well.

23:47.260 --> 23:52.120
But the problem with having the other shows vote is I don't think they all listen to Orange

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
Lounge Radio.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.920
I don't think they'll listen to the rules of the contest either because some of those

23:55.920 --> 23:58.000
entries is like, what the fuck is that?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
It's like a bumper.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
It's not even like a fucking commercial.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
No, but that's okay.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.880
I mean, bumpers were supposed to be okay.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
Okay.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.820
But it's not, from what I understand, some shows did not get a lot of participation.

24:07.820 --> 24:10.920
So I think they had to pick what they got.

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
Okay.

24:11.920 --> 24:12.920
Well, people should listen.

24:12.920 --> 24:17.200
It's supposed to be like a Grand Theft Auto commercial, not a fucking commercial for...

24:17.200 --> 24:18.200
Wait.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.200
This just in.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.160
Apparently Bobby Black Wolf voted for our show to win.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.360
So praise Bobby Black Wolf.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.360
Wait.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.360
No one listens.

24:26.360 --> 24:27.360
What do you think this is?

24:27.360 --> 24:28.360
The internet?

24:28.360 --> 24:29.360
So we know at least Matt won't get last place.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.040
But see, Bobby probably liked it because Bobby listens to our show.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.360
So he got all the votes.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.360
Got it.

24:34.360 --> 24:35.360
Got it.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.880
But I doubt the other shows are going to get it.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.880
So we'll see.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.760
All right.

24:40.760 --> 24:41.760
Moving on, moving on.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Enough.

24:42.760 --> 24:43.960
We'll let you know who actually wins next week.

24:43.960 --> 24:49.360
I do want to give one more shout out to the All Games crew right now, because there's

24:49.360 --> 24:52.560
a gal on there who I think we've all met, Jessica.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.360
Have you guys met Jessica?

24:54.360 --> 24:57.000
We've all met Jessica before, right?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
I don't know.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.880
I think she was there at E3 one year.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.800
She's the pretty gal who reads the news and all that stuff on their show.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.800
Well, that could be anybody.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.800
Yeah.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.680
But Jessica is cool.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.880
And she actually apparently is like, OK, I did not even know this was going on.

25:11.880 --> 25:18.280
But there's this website, Massify.com, where they're actually casting a horror movie online.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.680
Like people made YouTube-ish videos.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.480
I sound like you said a horror movie.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.960
No, a horror movie online.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.900
Well, Jessica was a finalist.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.100
Her thing was so popular.

25:27.100 --> 25:30.120
She was one of the top 20, one of the top 10 girls.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.380
They had her do a screen test.

25:32.380 --> 25:33.520
And now she's a finalist.

25:33.520 --> 25:37.520
And if she wins this, she's going to be in a movie.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.160
She's going to be in a horror movie.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.960
She's going to be victim number how much?

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
I don't know.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.880
Apparently, it's like a lead role if she wins this.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.880
That's pretty cool.

25:45.880 --> 25:46.880
That is very cool.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.060
I hope, though, she has a no nudity clause in her contract.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.060
She's a pretty girl.

25:50.060 --> 25:51.060
They'll try to take advantage of that.

25:51.060 --> 25:53.020
So Jessica, no nudity clause.

25:53.020 --> 25:54.800
You better write that in your contract.

25:54.800 --> 26:01.600
But anyway, if you want to vote for Jessica, we encourage you to Massify.com slash auditions

26:01.600 --> 26:03.480
slash 739.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.900
And I think you can only vote till Monday.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.020
Her name is Chanteuse on the site.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.020
So that's how you'll know.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.320
And I'll post that there in chat.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.240
So you all can go vote.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.240
You do have to register for the site.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.060
And they send verification emails.

26:17.060 --> 26:19.780
But come on, in this day and age, who doesn't have a spam email account?

26:19.780 --> 26:20.780
That all goes to us.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.540
So I just registered my spam email account.

26:22.540 --> 26:29.800
So Katamari's Forever in Chat says, the ferret will be in it as the slasher also.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.300
Now that's an idea for a horror movie.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.800
Maybe that could go in the everything is a trap game.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.060
Maybe the ferret is the mastermind behind all the traps.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.740
I didn't know the ferret liked slash.

26:39.740 --> 26:40.740
It'd be wonderful.

26:40.740 --> 26:41.740
All right.

26:41.740 --> 26:42.740
Anyhow.

26:42.740 --> 26:43.820
So go vote for Jessica.

26:43.820 --> 26:44.820
Make her happy.

26:44.820 --> 26:50.240
And well, we also want to say we know somebody in a horror movie, but all right, again, I

26:50.240 --> 26:53.300
just I just hope they wrote the nudity out because that would be awkward.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.880
Like you know, like, oh, hi, Jessica, I think I saw you naked in a movie.

26:56.880 --> 26:57.880
That's kind of awkward.

26:57.880 --> 26:58.880
All right.

26:58.880 --> 26:59.880
Moving on.

26:59.880 --> 27:04.220
Because chicks get naked in horror movies all the time.

27:04.220 --> 27:08.780
So I'm just hoping she pulled the Jamie Lee Curtis, you know, and said, not not going

27:08.780 --> 27:09.780
to happen.

27:09.780 --> 27:10.780
All right.

27:10.780 --> 27:14.580
Anyhow, let's get to our is very amused by the nudity talk.

27:14.580 --> 27:19.580
Look, if you were cast for a horror movie, Tara, wouldn't you make them write a no booby

27:19.580 --> 27:21.900
claws in the in the country?

27:21.900 --> 27:23.780
You would want to see me naked anyway.

27:23.780 --> 27:24.780
I know.

27:24.780 --> 27:26.900
I'm sure there's plenty of boys who would like to see the Tatas.

27:26.900 --> 27:27.900
But, you know.

27:27.900 --> 27:28.900
Yes.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.900
I mean, you guys are really selective on that.

27:30.900 --> 27:31.900
All right.

27:31.900 --> 27:37.260
It's like, oh, man, I got to look at moving on gaming news.

27:37.260 --> 27:39.500
We do do gaming on this show once in a while.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.500
Yes.

27:40.500 --> 27:41.500
I know nothing.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
We got a week to catch up on.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.500
Loki, catch us up.

27:43.500 --> 27:47.620
What did we miss from the week of the 11th through the 18th when we were gone?

27:47.620 --> 27:48.620
Absolutely nothing.

27:48.620 --> 27:54.780
Except for the news for last week, including there was a bunch of gaming events that went

27:54.780 --> 27:58.780
on, lots of stuff that we weren't invited to, of course.

27:58.780 --> 28:06.100
And so we have a few different gamers days, of course, one we like to talk about Konami.

28:06.100 --> 28:13.180
They had their gamer day recently and they announced a few things, including Rock Revolution,

28:13.180 --> 28:20.660
their journey back into, I guess, the guitar drum music game because they've never been

28:20.660 --> 28:21.660
there before.

28:21.660 --> 28:26.980
It's like, you know, oh, my God, they finally arrived.

28:26.980 --> 28:28.980
It's about time.

28:28.980 --> 28:35.220
But, yes, not to be outdone by, you know, some other companies who had put out certain

28:35.220 --> 28:37.500
games with drums.

28:37.500 --> 28:41.900
They decided, hey, our drum thing is not going to look like a drum at all and it's going

28:41.900 --> 28:47.060
to have like six buttons and we're going to be awesome because we're going to one-up everybody.

28:47.060 --> 28:54.300
So, yeah, six drum pads, one kick drum and it looks like 40 songs with download content

28:54.300 --> 28:59.900
planned, as well as the ability to record your own songs in a jam session with eight

28:59.900 --> 29:09.500
separate tracks, online co-op versus Battle of the Bands mode and a weird drum pad.

29:09.500 --> 29:15.340
We actually have the first confirmed song for the new Konami drum guitar.

29:15.340 --> 29:16.340
What's it called again?

29:16.340 --> 29:17.340
Rock Revolution?

29:17.340 --> 29:18.340
Yeah.

29:18.340 --> 29:27.900
It's called the confirmed song.

29:27.900 --> 29:34.900
No, I missed the bus.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.500
You missed the bus, Konami.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.500
You stole my joke.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.500
You missed the bus.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.100
Konami, you know what this is?

29:42.100 --> 29:44.620
It's the sound of the boat you missed five years ago.

29:44.620 --> 29:51.740
I just can't help but look at this and go, wow, that's, I guess, yay, yay, about time

29:51.740 --> 29:52.740
they figured out.

29:52.740 --> 29:53.740
Oh my God.

29:53.740 --> 29:54.740
Rock and roll.

29:54.740 --> 29:55.740
You can sell that.

29:55.740 --> 29:56.860
I feel horrible saying this about Konami.

29:56.860 --> 30:02.140
I feel really horrible saying this about Konami because, you know, they did kind of start

30:02.140 --> 30:03.140
the whole guitar.

30:03.140 --> 30:08.100
I mean, when they did it, they're like, but if only we could develop a guitar and drum

30:08.100 --> 30:09.100
game.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.100
Can we do that?

30:10.100 --> 30:13.780
And then like two years later, oh my God, we had one all along.

30:13.780 --> 30:15.860
Why didn't you tell me?

30:15.860 --> 30:19.980
Years ago on this program, and I think we've all said this, we've all said years ago on

30:19.980 --> 30:24.340
this program, we said, Konami is going to miss the bus by not putting this game out

30:24.340 --> 30:25.340
here.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.340
Somebody's going to beat them to it.

30:26.340 --> 30:29.520
And I'll be damned if we weren't right.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.820
And that's how they innovate on it.

30:30.820 --> 30:36.180
They make this really weird looking drum pad that looks like some cheesy toy.

30:36.180 --> 30:39.980
And then they like, um, I don't know.

30:39.980 --> 30:44.860
I can't imagine how this is going to be the U S R and D people at Konami are pissing themselves

30:44.860 --> 30:46.420
and shooting themselves in the foot.

30:46.420 --> 30:51.220
Well, you know, they got to diversify themselves somehow because now the market's really getting

30:51.220 --> 30:52.220
crowded.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.220
I got an idea.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.220
Fix beat mania.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.220
Yeah.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.220
Here's the mania is a great idea.

30:56.220 --> 31:00.300
Dude, there are people that are going to miss the bus on that again too, because there's

31:00.300 --> 31:02.980
that whole DJ hero that they're talking about putting out.

31:02.980 --> 31:07.580
So once again, they're going to get beat by these other people that have the U S license

31:07.580 --> 31:08.900
for cracking DJ.

31:08.900 --> 31:09.900
I'm not sure.

31:09.900 --> 31:14.260
I totally see this song in beat mania, dude, I'm stuck in the crib and I don't know what

31:14.260 --> 31:15.260
to do.

31:15.260 --> 31:16.260
Loki.

31:16.260 --> 31:20.780
Didn't you know that guitar hero totally ripped off the mania definitely ripped off the guitar

31:20.780 --> 31:21.780
hero.

31:21.780 --> 31:22.780
Yeah, totally.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
I mean, g four said it.

31:23.780 --> 31:24.780
It must be true.

31:24.780 --> 31:25.780
Everything anyways.

31:25.780 --> 31:29.820
So yeah, they announced that game as well as some other games, which I'm sure no one

31:29.820 --> 31:30.820
has ever heard of.

31:30.820 --> 31:31.820
Uh, hold on, hold on.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.700
AJ makes acts a really good question in chat.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.340
Does anyone really want rock revolution?

31:36.340 --> 31:37.340
What do you think?

31:37.340 --> 31:38.340
I mean, is this something?

31:38.340 --> 31:40.900
I guess the answer is if it's a good game, sure.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.900
Yeah.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.500
But that's just like saying, I don't really want guitar hero for either or guitar hero

31:45.500 --> 31:46.500
world tour.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.580
Did you cover guitar hero yet?

31:47.580 --> 31:48.580
No.

31:48.580 --> 31:49.580
Okay.

31:49.580 --> 31:50.580
Talk guitar hero.

31:50.580 --> 31:52.300
Cause I got something I want to add to this guitar hero world tour, which I don't even

31:52.300 --> 31:55.780
know why they're calling guitar hero anymore because now they've added drums.

31:55.780 --> 32:00.780
They're supposed to be more realistic because now they have two symbols that are up top

32:00.780 --> 32:02.820
and then they have three drum pads as well.

32:02.820 --> 32:03.820
So you have five.

32:03.820 --> 32:08.500
So you're immediately better than, you know, guitars or not guitar hero, rock band, because

32:08.500 --> 32:13.020
now you have one additional drum pad and they also have a kick drum as well.

32:13.020 --> 32:16.660
And apparently they're going to be, um, pressure sensitive.

32:16.660 --> 32:20.620
So if you hit them harder, the sounds heart, you know, louder, yippy.

32:20.620 --> 32:26.080
Um, and then the guitars changed again, but it's, you know, basically just another redesign.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.780
It's still five buttons, um, all that fun stuff.

32:29.780 --> 32:35.260
And uh, then they also have a sound creation or a song creation mode as well.

32:35.260 --> 32:40.060
And they're promising, you know, all the same stuff that rock bands prompt, actually all

32:40.060 --> 32:42.900
the same stuff that rock band is delivering with.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.980
And then some, you know, I got to say a song creation mode could be interesting.

32:45.980 --> 32:48.860
I'll tell you one game I checked out a demo for this week was jam sessions.

32:48.860 --> 32:52.460
I did the little, uh, Nintendo channel download service and I play jam sessions.

32:52.460 --> 32:53.460
That's actually kind of fun.

32:53.460 --> 32:54.460
You know what?

32:54.460 --> 32:56.500
No, it's really original about that song creation mode.

32:56.500 --> 33:00.460
It's that guitar freaks did it like years ago.

33:00.460 --> 33:05.940
God damn, but Konami missed the bus years ago.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.460
Oh, but it's completely original.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.220
You watch G4 and go, Oh, it's a completely original idea.

33:10.220 --> 33:11.220
So cool.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.700
Tiger claw sent a list of what songs are supposed to be in rock revolution.

33:14.700 --> 33:15.700
And some of it sounds interesting.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.020
I mean, it has come on field.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.020
The noise by quiet.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.020
Right?

33:19.020 --> 33:20.020
That's kind of the thing about this.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.020
Am I evil?

33:21.020 --> 33:22.020
Metallica?

33:22.020 --> 33:23.020
They're focusing on drums.

33:23.020 --> 33:24.580
That's basically their focus is on the drum.

33:24.580 --> 33:25.580
Okay, wait.

33:25.580 --> 33:27.580
Dance dance revolution does get some major points right here.

33:27.580 --> 33:29.740
We're not going to take it by twisted sister.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.420
That is pretty awesome, but they're all covers.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.300
That's less awesome anyways.

33:34.300 --> 33:39.700
So songs are games that we have never heard of, uh, dance dance revolution X, of course,

33:39.700 --> 33:41.860
they're celebrating their 10th anniversary.

33:41.860 --> 33:47.640
It's going to be all, you know, reskinned it kind of, they've got some interesting songs

33:47.640 --> 33:49.100
for it so far.

33:49.100 --> 33:52.580
Um, but it's going to be, uh, 70 different tracks.

33:52.580 --> 33:55.780
They're going to have a brand new LAN battle mode that's going to allow you to play up

33:55.780 --> 33:59.900
against, uh, eight players over, uh, LAN.

33:59.900 --> 34:03.860
So, you know, making it competitive, although I don't know why you would have eight people

34:03.860 --> 34:05.660
having a LAN party for DDR.

34:05.660 --> 34:09.980
Uh, you can create your own workout and fitness program through the workout mode.

34:09.980 --> 34:14.220
Uh, they're going to have new characters and enhanced graphics and still going to use the

34:14.220 --> 34:15.700
damn itoy.

34:15.700 --> 34:21.020
Um, then they're also going to have DDR universe three, which is only on the three 60 right

34:21.020 --> 34:28.340
now, also 70 songs with music from the seventies to today, uh, DJ mode and all this new surprises.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.340
No one.

34:29.340 --> 34:33.500
Uh, it's more DDR quest, low key, more DDR.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
Yeah.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.980
It, they really haven't innovated there.

34:35.980 --> 34:41.020
And then, um, hottest party too, which, you know, yeah, yeah.

34:41.020 --> 34:44.780
So we're DDR on the week, but you can have your me's now dancing in hottest part too.

34:44.780 --> 34:51.100
So yeah, but they showed off silent Hill silent Hills.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.100
Pretty cool.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.660
Happy about that.

34:53.660 --> 34:57.020
Uh, but that's basically it from, okay.

34:57.020 --> 35:00.180
So music games, I want to say, wait real quick on music games.

35:00.180 --> 35:01.540
Okay.

35:01.540 --> 35:04.060
I don't have room in my house for all that shit.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.540
Even if I could afford it, here's the deal.

35:06.540 --> 35:11.460
If you, if one, if these companies want to win this little war on music games, seriously,

35:11.460 --> 35:13.940
make a peripheral that works with all the games.

35:13.940 --> 35:19.140
Xbox 360 will not have that problem because they, well, I'm not sure about the drums,

35:19.140 --> 35:23.380
but with the guitars, they're made like one of the things Microsoft makes all the companies

35:23.380 --> 35:24.940
play nice with each other.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.500
So if it's got five buttons, it will work the same way.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.100
I didn't buy rock band for a reason.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.100
Well, I did buy rock band.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.180
I bought rock band as a standalone game with the guitar.

35:32.180 --> 35:35.620
I did not buy the whole big box for a reason.

35:35.620 --> 35:39.020
This is the reason this was coming.

35:39.020 --> 35:43.340
We all knew it, but I don't really, here's the thing though.

35:43.340 --> 35:44.340
I don't really care.

35:44.340 --> 35:49.020
It's like even, I think rock bands kind of hurt themselves a little bit because now that

35:49.020 --> 35:52.500
there's all this download content, and I don't know about a lot of people, but I've downloaded

35:52.500 --> 35:54.300
a lot of it.

35:54.300 --> 35:57.100
I don't really need another game with 40 songs in there.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.900
Why do I need to buy another game?

35:58.900 --> 36:01.420
Because they're really not going to innovate too much on it.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.220
It's just going to have song updates.

36:03.220 --> 36:07.060
But when you're getting, you know, three new tracks each week that you can download, by

36:07.060 --> 36:10.380
the time you get to where another game would be released, you already have another game

36:10.380 --> 36:11.980
built in.

36:11.980 --> 36:19.780
And the other thing too, which I'm not sure about, you know, Guitar Hero 4 on tour world

36:19.780 --> 36:23.260
or whatever the fuck they're calling it, World Tour.

36:23.260 --> 36:25.460
What about all that download content that you had from 3?

36:25.460 --> 36:28.140
I know Rock Band 2, one of the things that they were talking about is that you're going

36:28.140 --> 36:32.720
to be able to use your old download content from Rock Band 1 with the new game.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.540
Kind of like how, you know, DDR Ultra Mix used to do it.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.260
Comments from chat, chat.orangelandradio.com.

36:38.260 --> 36:43.540
Gerardimo says, wait, Miis and DDR, if you made Loki, me, in a green suit, would it be

36:43.540 --> 36:45.300
like Loki dancing in a tingle suit?

36:45.300 --> 36:46.300
No.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.100
Probably the closest thing you're going to get to it.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.460
Black Wolf is hugging his steel battalion controller.

36:50.460 --> 36:54.980
I think making a reference to expensive peripherals.

36:54.980 --> 36:59.300
But seriously, you're crazy if you own steel battalion.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.460
You have to be a certain kind of crazy to own steel battalion.

37:02.460 --> 37:05.580
Right Dark Sakura?

37:05.580 --> 37:08.300
I have no room to talk.

37:08.300 --> 37:15.060
But yeah, it's going to be really hard for these guys to sell, you know, because also

37:15.060 --> 37:19.560
there's rumors going around now with what GameStop has listed on their website for Guitar

37:19.560 --> 37:23.700
Hero World Tour, where it's going to cost like $179.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.220
So essentially, you know, like 10 bucks more than Rock Band.

37:27.220 --> 37:32.500
I mean, really, are you guys going to spend close to another $200 to buy, you know, I'm

37:32.500 --> 37:36.460
assuming a lot of people out there bought Rock Band and probably bought all the peripherals

37:36.460 --> 37:37.460
for it.

37:37.460 --> 37:40.820
But you know, you did that because now you can use your guitar with Guitar Hero and stuff

37:40.820 --> 37:41.820
like that.

37:41.820 --> 37:46.280
But are you really going to buy more stuff to do Guitar Hero World Tour?

37:46.280 --> 37:50.340
Don't get me wrong, Steel Battalion is a piece of gaming history.

37:50.340 --> 37:53.860
I mean, it's the only controller ever that has an eject button and that makes it all

37:53.860 --> 37:54.860
kinds of awesome.

37:54.860 --> 37:56.700
But you seriously have to be all kinds of crazy.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.420
It's just, I don't know, it's going to be really hard with all these games coming out

37:59.420 --> 38:00.420
in the holiday.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.900
I don't think some of them are going to do well.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.300
I'm sure Guitar Hero will do well by itself.

38:04.300 --> 38:08.340
Maybe people will just pick up World Tour and maybe do the drums later or something

38:08.340 --> 38:10.220
because you can do that or you can buy.

38:10.220 --> 38:11.220
I will buy the game.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.220
I will not buy the guitar.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.460
I will not buy the game if it's not compatible with the guitar I already have.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.540
I am not buying a new guitar until that one is run, the one I have is run into the ground.

38:19.540 --> 38:20.540
The end.

38:20.540 --> 38:23.340
I don't understand why they, you know, redesign the guitar anyways each time.

38:23.340 --> 38:25.860
It's just, all that does is delay the game.

38:25.860 --> 38:29.940
So anyway, so enough of Konami's gamer days.

38:29.940 --> 38:30.940
Alright, sorry.

38:30.940 --> 38:31.940
That's the last week's news.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.780
Anyways, so other stuff.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.700
We've got Sony had their sort of gamer day.

38:38.700 --> 38:39.940
So there's some stuff coming out of that.

38:39.940 --> 38:47.260
I remember they've got, they were showing off some of their new games like, you know,

38:47.260 --> 38:51.460
Killzone 2 and Resistance Fall Man 2 and that kind of stuff.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.740
Resistance is supposed to be coming out this fall.

38:53.740 --> 38:57.460
Killzone 2 has been delayed to February because they don't want to compete with themselves,

38:57.460 --> 38:59.180
which, you know, makes sense.

38:59.180 --> 39:05.060
And then Motor Storm is going to be coming out, of course, also in the fall as well.

39:05.060 --> 39:12.740
Little Big Planet, October, and there is a new SOCOM game, Confrontation, I believe,

39:12.740 --> 39:16.340
that's coming out to their PlayStation Network in September.

39:16.340 --> 39:20.540
Also, Sega was showing off their stuff as well.

39:20.540 --> 39:24.380
They announced a partnership with Platinum Games and they're going to be putting out

39:24.380 --> 39:28.340
three games in the beginning of this.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.940
One of the games, pretty awesome.

39:30.940 --> 39:33.180
Did they announce plastic maracas for Samba?

39:33.180 --> 39:34.180
No.

39:34.180 --> 39:35.180
Don't care.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.260
Well, that's not Platinum Games, okay.

39:37.260 --> 39:38.260
But they're working on it.

39:38.260 --> 39:42.060
They want to make those, okay.

39:42.060 --> 39:48.380
So right now, the one game, Mad World, which is going to be an ultra-violent game for the

39:48.380 --> 39:49.380
Wii.

39:49.380 --> 39:50.380
It's all black and white except for the blood.

39:50.380 --> 39:52.900
All right, I'm interested.

39:52.900 --> 39:53.900
Extremely awesome.

39:53.900 --> 39:59.020
There were, you know, they're killing people in all sorts of fun ways.

39:59.020 --> 40:04.420
There's another game that's going to be coming out as well.

40:04.420 --> 40:06.780
That is on the DS.

40:06.780 --> 40:10.380
I'm trying to remember who was making that one.

40:10.380 --> 40:11.380
Some other developer.

40:11.380 --> 40:14.820
But it's a pretty cool like, I want to say like a shooter game.

40:14.820 --> 40:17.160
What was it?

40:17.160 --> 40:20.740
It was Infinite Line.

40:20.740 --> 40:23.420
And I love the company's name for this, Nude Maker.

40:23.420 --> 40:24.420
Nice.

40:24.420 --> 40:29.860
But they, and to kind of tie back here, they are the creator of Steel Battalion and before

40:29.860 --> 40:33.780
that, the Clock Tower series, and that's coming to the DS.

40:33.780 --> 40:39.300
And then on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, they're getting a game called Bayonetta,

40:39.300 --> 40:46.340
which is an action game starring this chick that has guns on her feet, like pistols.

40:46.340 --> 40:50.380
Wasn't that the movie that Quentin Tarantino did recently?

40:50.380 --> 40:55.660
It's not, she doesn't, she has legs, but there's like strapped to her boots are like pistols.

40:55.660 --> 40:56.660
Okay.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.660
Type thing.

40:57.660 --> 40:58.660
All right.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.660
It's cool looking.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.660
Okay.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.660
And so that's going to be coming as well.

41:01.660 --> 41:06.420
And I think not the, I think she's supposed to be like a witch or something, not to compare

41:06.420 --> 41:09.140
it to bullet with sharing a thing, but.

41:09.140 --> 41:10.620
So she's a witch with guns.

41:10.620 --> 41:11.620
Witch with guns.

41:11.620 --> 41:12.620
Amazing.

41:12.620 --> 41:13.620
And.

41:13.620 --> 41:14.620
Why didn't I think of that?

41:14.620 --> 41:16.020
I don't know.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.940
You're just not on the cutting edge of game development there.

41:18.940 --> 41:23.180
This is why we have a podcast on the internet and I'm trying to think if there's anything

41:23.180 --> 41:24.180
else.

41:24.180 --> 41:25.180
Reading comments from chat real quick.

41:25.180 --> 41:28.740
DJ Morpheus says, then I'll get the rock band rehab expansion that comes when you create

41:28.740 --> 41:30.380
your own eat true Hollywood story.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.380
That would be fun.

41:31.380 --> 41:33.700
Like a tar hero mixed with heroin hero.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.820
Good times.

41:35.820 --> 41:36.820
Let's see.

41:36.820 --> 41:40.060
Gerardo says that there might be Morocco sleeves for somebody because that's one thing they're

41:40.060 --> 41:41.060
talking about.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.900
If not, there's always third party companies.

41:42.900 --> 41:43.900
Someone will make it.

41:43.900 --> 41:47.540
If you, the demands there.

41:47.540 --> 41:51.900
One thing, they had, Microsoft did their little gamer day thing as well.

41:51.900 --> 41:55.380
They showed off the new Banjo Kazooie game.

41:55.380 --> 41:58.220
No motion controllers, unfortunately.

41:58.220 --> 42:01.460
No word on what that lips peripheral was or anything like that.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.700
I guess we're just going to have to wait.

42:03.700 --> 42:07.900
And they showed off Gears of War 2, of course, a little bit more of that.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.420
Looks pretty awesome.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.540
And that of course will be coming out this fall.

42:12.540 --> 42:14.580
Trying to think if there's anything else.

42:14.580 --> 42:15.580
Cool.

42:15.580 --> 42:20.940
We'll be getting into later on about Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.

42:20.940 --> 42:28.160
And I also know that the XNA service has been launched, but just for the developers.

42:28.160 --> 42:32.700
So people that have a membership to XNA can play the games.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.340
All right.

42:34.340 --> 42:37.700
So well, it sounds like because wasn't the community supposed to vote on the games and

42:37.700 --> 42:38.700
stuff?

42:38.700 --> 42:41.980
They're probably getting it ready for letting it run a few cycles so that they have some

42:41.980 --> 42:43.740
games to go live when they go live.

42:43.740 --> 42:44.740
Yeah.

42:44.740 --> 42:45.740
All right.

42:45.740 --> 42:46.860
Enough of last week's news.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.540
We're almost 45 minutes into the show.

42:48.540 --> 42:51.060
It's time to get into this week's news.

42:51.060 --> 42:54.780
And speaking of Guitar Hero, we're going to start off with another Guitar Hero story because

42:54.780 --> 42:57.260
I swear these music games have been all over the news lately.

42:57.260 --> 42:58.900
It's crazy.

42:58.900 --> 43:03.300
On the PlayStation 3 only, Guitar Hero is going to be getting a free song.

43:03.300 --> 43:07.140
It makes sense because the Xbox 360 got a free Halo song.

43:07.140 --> 43:10.940
So why not a free God of War song for PlayStation 3 owners?

43:10.940 --> 43:14.020
And that's exactly what they're going to be getting on June 5th.

43:14.020 --> 43:16.620
Except we don't know which song it is.

43:16.620 --> 43:21.980
Just knows that it's a God of War song and it probably has a lot of heavy guitars seeing

43:21.980 --> 43:23.660
as it's going to be in Guitar Hero.

43:23.660 --> 43:24.660
So it'd be free.

43:24.660 --> 43:27.700
So it's kind of like Sony's answer to, or I guess you could say, you know, the equivalent

43:27.700 --> 43:33.300
of the Halo theme on the Xbox 360 Guitar Hero.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.300
So check it out.

43:34.300 --> 43:35.300
Do we have to?

43:35.300 --> 43:36.300
No, you don't have to.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.300
I mean, if you don't own a PS3, you kind of can't.

43:38.300 --> 43:39.300
I'll check it out.

43:39.300 --> 43:40.300
Then I won't.

43:40.300 --> 43:43.700
I like free, but then again, Yaris was also free.

43:43.700 --> 43:44.700
That's true.

43:44.700 --> 43:46.540
But I don't, I don't see how you can go wrong with a free song.

43:46.540 --> 43:50.260
Free songs are only going to, if a free song sucks, it's only going to terrorize you for

43:50.260 --> 43:51.460
three minutes and then it's over.

43:51.460 --> 43:54.820
Unless it's yodeling with, you know, Zither as the company.

43:54.820 --> 43:55.820
Yodel Hero.

43:55.820 --> 43:56.820
Where's that?

43:56.820 --> 43:57.820
That's, that's what I want.

43:57.820 --> 44:03.060
How about something that has absolutely nothing to do with music games?

44:03.060 --> 44:04.060
Wind it up.

44:04.060 --> 44:05.060
Nothing to do with music games.

44:05.060 --> 44:06.060
All right.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.060
Nothing to do with music games.

44:07.060 --> 44:09.980
Except for one of these theme songs was used in Pop Up Music.

44:09.980 --> 44:10.980
Okay.

44:10.980 --> 44:16.420
One, actually two of my favorite companies ever are getting together to make a fighting

44:16.420 --> 44:17.420
game.

44:17.420 --> 44:22.540
I am very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very tense, infinity happy about

44:22.540 --> 44:24.340
this.

44:24.340 --> 44:26.580
We are getting Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

44:26.580 --> 44:27.580
Yay.

44:27.580 --> 44:28.580
So happy.

44:28.580 --> 44:31.980
And for those that have no effing idea what Tatsunoko is.

44:31.980 --> 44:38.460
Is this the animation studio that gave us such a wonderful series as of course my favorite

44:38.460 --> 44:46.220
of all time, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman gave us Kashan, which are actually Ken and

44:46.220 --> 44:50.220
Tetsuya are both confirmed characters for that.

44:50.220 --> 44:54.700
They're on the test versions now along with Ryu and Chun-Li.

44:54.700 --> 44:58.860
But they're also for, you know, other things that they gave us was Hurricane Polymer did

44:58.860 --> 45:02.940
a lot of the animation for Evangelion.

45:02.940 --> 45:07.940
It gave us, I don't know if anyone watched a lot of Nickelodeon in the, the mid to late

45:07.940 --> 45:15.060
80s, but they gave us the little bits and quite a few other crazy, well, they actually

45:15.060 --> 45:32.500
have the Gatchaman music in it, but also, and I apologize, I had to use a different

45:32.500 --> 45:36.420
source in what you gave me, Rob, because I, that's all right.

45:36.420 --> 45:43.980
What was also sort of hinted at as far as being included in the game is characters from

45:43.980 --> 45:51.820
Timeboukan, Hurricane Polymer, Tekkaman, Hakusho and Daimo, the Genie family.

45:51.820 --> 45:58.060
So and anyone else who doesn't know, MotGogoGo was Tatsunoko as well, which was Speed Racer

45:58.060 --> 45:59.060
for us.

45:59.060 --> 46:00.060
Was it Macross also?

46:00.060 --> 46:01.060
Macross was as well.

46:01.060 --> 46:02.060
Yes.

46:02.060 --> 46:07.140
It's an honest question though, is this game really going to come out in America?

46:07.140 --> 46:08.140
Like ever?

46:08.140 --> 46:12.780
God, I hope so, and if not, I'll drive my ass down to Arcade Infinity and play the hell

46:12.780 --> 46:13.780
out of it.

46:13.780 --> 46:14.780
Oh, it's an arcade.

46:14.780 --> 46:15.780
Yeah.

46:15.780 --> 46:16.780
Hmm.

46:16.780 --> 46:20.260
Oh, they're not, are they putting it out on home platforms at all, they said?

46:20.260 --> 46:21.260
I haven't seen any mention on it.

46:21.260 --> 46:24.500
Hopefully PlayStation 3, because then you can import that bitch.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.500
That's a good point.

46:25.500 --> 46:30.380
However, if anyone wants to see, there are some, okay, don't look for the Famitsu scans,

46:30.380 --> 46:31.380
they're crap.

46:31.380 --> 46:35.980
Um, go actually onto Famitsu's website and look up the images.

46:35.980 --> 46:42.020
I mean, if you, if you do a search for Tatsunoko versus Capcom, you'll find a link to Famitsu's

46:42.020 --> 46:44.500
page that's got all the stuff on it.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.900
Just tons of pretty pictures.

46:46.900 --> 46:53.060
And one of the levels that they're fighting on looks like it's a Mega Man Legends level.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.060
Wait, what?

46:54.060 --> 46:56.220
Thank God the Servbots are back.

46:56.220 --> 46:59.820
Yeah, it has a giant Servbot in the background.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.820
Hot.

47:00.820 --> 47:04.260
So, um, maybe we'll be seeing, uh, Rockman.

47:04.260 --> 47:06.700
Maybe we'll be seeing Tron Bon.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.380
That would be cool.

47:08.380 --> 47:10.540
Rama is pretty convinced it's not coming out here.

47:10.540 --> 47:14.300
He says in chat, uh, Tatsunoko versus Capcom will not happen in the U S due to massive

47:14.300 --> 47:15.300
licensing issues.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.420
It doesn't mean they won't import it over here.

47:17.420 --> 47:21.140
So never say never, but it'll be, you know, import heaven.

47:21.140 --> 47:23.980
Why do you think I said arcade infinity?

47:23.980 --> 47:25.620
Cause they, they, are they still around?

47:25.620 --> 47:26.620
Are they still?

47:26.620 --> 47:27.620
I'm sure they are.

47:27.620 --> 47:28.620
I'm sure they are too.

47:28.620 --> 47:33.340
I mean, what are, what arcades have been getting like the, the big imports for ages?

47:33.340 --> 47:34.340
True is arcade.

47:34.340 --> 47:36.300
They even had that weirdo Gundam game.

47:36.300 --> 47:37.300
I mean, hello.

47:37.300 --> 47:38.300
They had um, Jammer Lammy.

47:38.300 --> 47:43.460
I remember playing the game and I had to now don't get the dirty thoughts out of your mind.

47:43.460 --> 47:46.580
I had to play the game on my knees because it's made for little kids.

47:46.580 --> 47:49.580
So I had to like get on my knees to play the arcade game.

47:49.580 --> 47:52.660
Best game that was there was the pancake flipping game.

47:52.660 --> 47:56.700
No, no, no punch mania.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.900
The tambourine game was my favorite thing ever.

47:59.900 --> 48:02.900
That that was the gayest game I've ever played in my life.

48:02.900 --> 48:03.900
Yes.

48:03.900 --> 48:06.540
It was samba de amigo with tambourines and you actually had to shake the tambourine and

48:06.540 --> 48:07.780
make these little motions.

48:07.780 --> 48:12.740
It was the gayest thing I've ever done in my life.

48:12.740 --> 48:13.740
Are you sure?

48:13.740 --> 48:14.740
You gay?

48:14.740 --> 48:15.740
Yes.

48:15.740 --> 48:20.980
If you play a tambourine game, you gay.

48:20.980 --> 48:26.660
For real like I've marched in the San Francisco pride parade and the tambourine game was gayer.

48:26.660 --> 48:27.660
Alright.

48:27.660 --> 48:30.660
I marched behind like assless chaps across America.

48:30.660 --> 48:32.140
Better than wearing the orange hat.

48:32.140 --> 48:34.100
And the tambourine was gayer.

48:34.100 --> 48:37.540
Alright, moving on.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.140
Tambourine was gayer.

48:39.140 --> 48:45.460
Anyways, so Microsoft made an announcement and this kind of ruins all those rumors that

48:45.460 --> 48:52.660
we had earlier about motion sensing calibration coming to a spring update.

48:52.660 --> 48:55.820
Well there is no spring dashboard update this year.

48:55.820 --> 49:01.820
So so sad, no update, but you know there may be some other stuff coming later on that's

49:01.820 --> 49:04.500
not involved with a dashboard update.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.500
So.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.500
Oh well.

49:06.500 --> 49:10.140
If it ain't broke, don't fix it I guess.

49:10.140 --> 49:12.180
If it ain't broke, break it more.

49:12.180 --> 49:13.180
I don't know.

49:13.180 --> 49:14.620
It's a little sad though that they're not doing an update.

49:14.620 --> 49:17.740
I kind of looked forward to those things and especially like we knew.

49:17.740 --> 49:22.100
I think some list leaked that week we were out of the supposed things that were going

49:22.100 --> 49:23.100
to be in it.

49:23.100 --> 49:26.100
They were supposed to have podcasts on the 360 now and all this stuff and I was thinking

49:26.100 --> 49:30.620
like this all sounds really cool even though I you know we all knew the list was bullshit.

49:30.620 --> 49:34.660
I mean it was still kind of sad when Microsoft says no none of it.

49:34.660 --> 49:36.660
None of it for you.

49:36.660 --> 49:40.740
Yeah it just better make the fall update that much cooler.

49:40.740 --> 49:41.740
Before I forget.

49:41.740 --> 49:42.740
Sorry to interrupt.

49:42.740 --> 49:50.200
I'm linking the Tatsunoko versus Capcom Famitsu page in the chat room.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.860
I was so three minutes ago.

49:52.860 --> 49:53.860
Sorry.

49:53.860 --> 49:54.860
I had to find it.

49:54.860 --> 49:55.860
I do that all the time.

49:55.860 --> 49:56.860
Timmy missed the bus.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.860
I wouldn't shut up about the missed the bus the whole time.

49:58.860 --> 49:59.860
I didn't miss the bus.

49:59.860 --> 50:00.860
I drive a fucking tank.

50:00.860 --> 50:01.860
Alright.

50:01.860 --> 50:07.500
I blew up the bus.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.700
Speaking of bus.

50:09.700 --> 50:13.540
I made a new friend last night is actually somebody who's listened to our show before.

50:13.540 --> 50:17.980
He's a friend of a mutual friend and we were talking about games we'd like to see on the

50:17.980 --> 50:18.980
Wii.

50:18.980 --> 50:22.780
We were talking about the Wii Wheel and he said I know what the Wii Wheel would be useful

50:22.780 --> 50:23.780
for.

50:23.780 --> 50:26.380
Desert bus on virtual console.

50:26.380 --> 50:28.000
You go to hell.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.860
You go to hell.

50:29.860 --> 50:33.580
And I was like that would make that Wii Wheel kind of useful.

50:33.580 --> 50:38.220
Yeah for you know an 18 hour drive in real time.

50:38.220 --> 50:41.640
It was a four hour drive in real time isn't it?

50:41.640 --> 50:44.540
It's Vegas L.A. isn't it?

50:44.540 --> 50:46.820
Alright it's.

50:46.820 --> 50:47.820
That is hotness.

50:47.820 --> 50:48.820
Jamie's making me look at screen time.

50:48.820 --> 50:50.820
Yes it's very sexy.

50:50.820 --> 51:01.340
Alright let's move on to some more gaming news and something

51:01.340 --> 51:04.500
you might be able to play on the Xbox 360.

51:04.500 --> 51:07.220
RBI baseball.

51:07.220 --> 51:08.520
Remember RBI baseball?

51:08.520 --> 51:13.620
This game is old school like I think it was yeah it was put out by Tengen.

51:13.620 --> 51:17.620
They were like the rebel company you know they put out that original Tetris.

51:17.620 --> 51:20.820
So basically it was, wasn't it a spin off of Atari like an Atari.

51:20.820 --> 51:21.820
Yes it was.

51:21.820 --> 51:22.820
Yeah.

51:22.820 --> 51:23.820
So here's the thing.

51:23.820 --> 51:24.820
Poor Atari.

51:24.820 --> 51:31.200
Apparently the ESRB is listed RBI baseball but the developers is six degree games.

51:31.200 --> 51:35.020
So I don't know if it's going to be the same RBI baseball.

51:35.020 --> 51:36.020
Probably not.

51:36.020 --> 51:37.020
It better be.

51:37.020 --> 51:39.720
That would be kind of rad if it was because that's that I don't play a lot of sports games

51:39.720 --> 51:42.240
but I remember RBI baseball.

51:42.240 --> 51:49.140
They really should like change their name to the six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

51:49.140 --> 51:53.740
So regardless the ESRB listed it so you know it's coming soon RBI baseball to Xbox Live

51:53.740 --> 51:55.860
Arcade.

51:55.860 --> 51:59.060
Well we have some other news regarding Xbox Live Arcade.

51:59.060 --> 52:01.820
Anything that's crap goes.

52:01.820 --> 52:10.340
Microsoft is going to be delisting older Xbox Live Arcade titles that sold small numbers

52:10.340 --> 52:13.060
and have a low Metacritic average.

52:13.060 --> 52:14.060
Yaris?

52:14.060 --> 52:15.060
Please be Yaris.

52:15.060 --> 52:18.460
It was free so a ton of people downloaded it.

52:18.460 --> 52:19.460
It's attached rates.

52:19.460 --> 52:20.540
Yaris will be immune.

52:20.540 --> 52:24.300
People that bought the full version and unfortunately since it was a free download that counts as

52:24.300 --> 52:25.300
the full version.

52:25.300 --> 52:26.300
Fuck.

52:26.300 --> 52:31.100
There's a quote by Mark Whitten who's Xbox Live's general manager saying we will be delisting

52:31.100 --> 52:36.540
older underperforming titles in order to keep the service focused on a section of high quality

52:36.540 --> 52:37.540
games.

52:37.540 --> 52:41.060
To translate that means they're shit get them off the server.

52:41.060 --> 52:46.420
No to translate that means our marketplace is insufficient to handle this many games

52:46.420 --> 52:51.780
so we have to find a way to reduce it because I think that's seriously what it is is that

52:51.780 --> 52:57.500
there's too many games in the marketplace because Xbox doesn't present it in a very

52:57.500 --> 52:59.780
user friendly way.

52:59.780 --> 53:05.380
Well the rest of the quote goes on to say the way this will work is that the title will

53:05.380 --> 53:09.980
need to be at least six months old and have a Metacritic score below 65 and a conversion

53:09.980 --> 53:13.620
rate below 6% on the service.

53:13.620 --> 53:17.980
Which means fewer than 6% of the people will have downloaded the demo and actually pay

53:17.980 --> 53:18.980
for it.

53:18.980 --> 53:23.860
They say they're also giving a three month notice before delisting anything.

53:23.860 --> 53:27.460
That's kind of interesting though that the critics will have kind of a say.

53:27.460 --> 53:29.020
That's kind of scary in a way.

53:29.020 --> 53:33.060
I mean I realize it's got to be both criteria but that's still kind of strange to me.

53:33.060 --> 53:34.060
Yeah.

53:34.060 --> 53:35.060
I don't know.

53:35.060 --> 53:36.060
Let's see.

53:36.060 --> 53:39.500
Here's some games that per Metacritic would be eligible for delisting.

53:39.500 --> 53:42.380
Now granted we don't know how well it sold through.

53:42.380 --> 53:44.300
Discs of Tron has a 44.

53:44.300 --> 53:47.140
I have to go download that now.

53:47.140 --> 53:50.500
I got to tell you what though it really isn't.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.020
It was better in your childhood Jamie.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.020
It really was.

53:53.020 --> 53:54.460
Is it at least six months old?

53:54.460 --> 53:55.740
It's getting there.

53:55.740 --> 53:58.380
So it's not eligible yet.

53:58.380 --> 54:02.340
Let's see what else is under 65 here Metacritic.

54:02.340 --> 54:05.100
Mr. Driller online is a 48 right now.

54:05.100 --> 54:08.860
So Mr. Driller online would be eligible for the plug pull in.

54:08.860 --> 54:09.860
Let's see.

54:09.860 --> 54:14.940
Rocky and Bullinkle 37 on Metacritic but that game, that game was shit.

54:14.940 --> 54:16.860
That game was pretty shit.

54:16.860 --> 54:17.860
Tikal.

54:17.860 --> 54:18.860
Tikal.

54:18.860 --> 54:19.860
Tikal.

54:19.860 --> 54:20.860
58.

54:20.860 --> 54:21.860
Quick.

54:21.860 --> 54:24.460
Can you name what Tikal, can you name what that game is?

54:24.460 --> 54:26.020
It's a puzzle game.

54:26.020 --> 54:27.020
Okay.

54:27.020 --> 54:28.020
Good.

54:28.020 --> 54:29.020
You're right.

54:29.020 --> 54:30.020
It's a puzzle game.

54:30.020 --> 54:31.020
So that's what we got.

54:31.020 --> 54:32.020
Let's see.

54:32.020 --> 54:34.340
That gives you an idea of the type of games that could be there.

54:34.340 --> 54:39.460
Yaris I believe was 17, had a score of 17 on Metacritic last time I looked.

54:39.460 --> 54:40.460
Bye bye Yaris.

54:40.460 --> 54:41.460
It was pretty terrible.

54:41.460 --> 54:42.460
Euthanizing.

54:42.460 --> 54:43.460
But it's got the sell through.

54:43.460 --> 54:44.460
I don't know.

54:44.460 --> 54:45.460
Now here's the thing.

54:45.460 --> 54:50.020
Tiger call also said the other exact thing I was thinking before is that this, Sky this

54:50.020 --> 54:55.180
is also bad because people that bought those games won't be able to redownload them if

54:55.180 --> 54:56.980
they ever delete them from the hard drive.

54:56.980 --> 55:00.820
But Black Wolf says that question was asked directly and they said yes, you can still

55:00.820 --> 55:04.460
redownload them using the account management interface.

55:04.460 --> 55:08.820
And Black Wolf says they just won't have shelf space anymore, which is kind of a good comparison

55:08.820 --> 55:12.380
to make is that it's like pulling these games off of shelves and putting them in the bargain

55:12.380 --> 55:13.380
bin.

55:13.380 --> 55:14.380
They're not selling.

55:14.380 --> 55:16.180
I think these games should go in the bargain bin, honestly.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.220
But Yaris was already free.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.460
So they have to pay people to download Yaris.

55:20.460 --> 55:22.660
Which they should be.

55:22.660 --> 55:25.820
There's no amount of money worth downloading Yaris.

55:25.820 --> 55:27.420
So it's going to be interesting.

55:27.420 --> 55:28.900
I'm kind of curious to see the effect.

55:28.900 --> 55:33.020
I mean, I agree to some extent they need to clean up Xbox Live.

55:33.020 --> 55:36.180
But I don't know if I agree with getting rid of games completely.

55:36.180 --> 55:39.820
Sweeping them under the rug and making them harder to find.

55:39.820 --> 55:40.820
Sure.

55:40.820 --> 55:44.900
Spotlighting the games that need to be have the spotlight on them because these other

55:44.900 --> 55:47.580
you know crappy retro ports are out doing them.

55:47.580 --> 55:51.540
You know, Rob, if they're going to clean up Xbox Live, they should probably start with

55:51.540 --> 55:53.420
the users.

55:53.420 --> 55:57.100
Well, they have been doing that to some extent recently.

55:57.100 --> 56:00.500
We'll get to more on that a little later.

56:00.500 --> 56:03.500
But for now, let's get back to some more gaming news.

56:03.500 --> 56:07.540
So Xbox, one of the things, and this kind of goes back to people having to redownload

56:07.540 --> 56:09.340
games and stuff.

56:09.340 --> 56:15.940
If you've ever had your Xbox 360 crap out on you and, you know, got a replacement, you

56:15.940 --> 56:20.160
may find that some of your games don't work anymore unless you're logged in online.

56:20.160 --> 56:24.900
Well now, Microsoft is going to release a tool tied in with Xbox.com that will allow

56:24.900 --> 56:31.500
you to fix the digital rights management so that your games are locked to your new console

56:31.500 --> 56:36.780
so there will be no more problems with your games not working offline.

56:36.780 --> 56:38.900
About fucking time.

56:38.900 --> 56:40.900
About damn time.

56:40.900 --> 56:45.360
That also applies to if you bought an elite system and transferred your stuff using that

56:45.360 --> 56:47.780
hard drive transfer cable.

56:47.780 --> 56:48.980
That will also screw it up.

56:48.980 --> 56:52.460
So that's nice to see that they're finally fixing it.

56:52.460 --> 56:56.060
Yeah, seems to be a little late, but yeah, I have a couple games, because I got the Red

56:56.060 --> 56:57.060
Ring of Death.

56:57.060 --> 57:01.020
Now granted, I got Red Ring of Death three days after I bought my Xbox 360, so I only

57:01.020 --> 57:04.700
have two games that do this, but Geometry Wars and Joust were like the first two games

57:04.700 --> 57:06.620
I bought on Xbox Live Arcade.

57:06.620 --> 57:11.060
And whenever I try to play them, if I'm not connected to Xbox Live, they won't work.

57:11.060 --> 57:12.660
So in Geometry Wars, that's a pretty big deal.

57:12.660 --> 57:16.740
Like, and you'll know, I even noticed like a little bit of lag when I go into the game,

57:16.740 --> 57:20.140
like it's talking to Xbox Live and then realizes I have the retail version and then suddenly

57:20.140 --> 57:22.420
my menu changes to the retail menu.

57:22.420 --> 57:23.860
It all happens within seconds.

57:23.860 --> 57:26.460
So it'll be kind of nice to take those games back.

57:26.460 --> 57:30.420
I know other people have had way worse scenarios where it was more than two games and multiple

57:30.420 --> 57:31.420
users in the house.

57:31.420 --> 57:33.860
My console has way more than two games.

57:33.860 --> 57:34.860
Yeah.

57:34.860 --> 57:40.420
So, that'll be kind of nice to reset the digital rights management, so we'll see how that works

57:40.420 --> 57:42.380
when that comes out.

57:42.380 --> 57:46.140
I will definitely be running it to get those, to take back control of those two games, but

57:46.140 --> 57:47.140
we'll see.

57:47.140 --> 57:52.340
Well, you're talking a little bit about rediscovering things that were a little bit old and if you've

57:52.340 --> 57:56.980
never played Gears of War, it's probably time to come out from under your rock and now's

57:56.980 --> 58:00.240
a good time though because what's going to be happening is that Gears of War is coming

58:00.240 --> 58:05.620
out with a brand new like re-release, a game of the year edition, if you will.

58:05.620 --> 58:07.100
It's coming out this summer.

58:07.100 --> 58:12.380
It's Gears of War with all the download content included that originally people had to pay

58:12.380 --> 58:15.220
for and it's only going to be 40 bucks.

58:15.220 --> 58:18.900
So, that's kind of cool.

58:18.900 --> 58:21.620
I won't be impressed because I like the Windows version.

58:21.620 --> 58:24.300
So, June 24th is apparently the day this is coming out.

58:24.300 --> 58:28.100
Hey, just in time for my birthday and the sixth birthday of Orange Launch Radio as well

58:28.100 --> 58:29.260
on the 23rd of June.

58:29.260 --> 58:30.260
That's hardcore.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.260
Yes.

58:31.260 --> 58:35.300
So, if you haven't played Gears of War, you can check that out, but I think honestly most

58:35.300 --> 58:38.880
people that would enjoy Gears of War have probably already played it, so this does seem

58:38.880 --> 58:43.900
a little bit late, but there's a lot of people that are just now getting Xbox 360s too, you

58:43.900 --> 58:49.580
know, as the price comes down and more people get HDTVs and want to spend their stimulus

58:49.580 --> 58:52.540
checks and yada, yada, yada.

58:52.540 --> 58:55.500
They'll be an audience for this and won't be a huge audience, but they'll be an audience

58:55.500 --> 58:56.700
for this.

58:56.700 --> 59:02.500
Well, one thing though that I think is going to work out better for everybody who has an

59:02.500 --> 59:08.540
Xbox and it's about damn time and I think that we all saw it happening is that Xbox

59:08.540 --> 59:17.340
Live Arcade is going to be changing their limit from 150MB to 350MB and it's been made

59:17.340 --> 59:24.660
official especially since we've got Soul Calibur coming out.

59:24.660 --> 59:28.940
They're really trying to get me to upgrade to that 100GB hard drive already because I

59:28.940 --> 59:32.260
only have a 20GB drive still that I've just been making work.

59:32.260 --> 59:34.980
I had to finally uninstall Final Fantasy XI to get the room.

59:34.980 --> 59:39.740
Well, the price limit of Xbox Live Arcade games has actually also been raised to 1600

59:39.740 --> 59:42.740
points, which is about 20 bucks.

59:42.740 --> 59:45.700
Developers, you better make darn sure your game is worth it.

59:45.700 --> 59:50.140
I mean, the Penny Arcade game, they'll get it for that and it's, you know, it's pretty

59:50.140 --> 59:51.140
cool.

59:51.140 --> 59:53.620
Again, I don't have a chance, I haven't had a chance to give it a full review yet, so

59:53.620 --> 59:57.180
I can't say for sure if it's worth the 20 bucks, but it seems like it will be.

59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.300
We shall see.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.180
Interesting though that they're, why do they even have the limits in the first place?

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.140
I guess they don't want people to go crazy, but I think, you know, when you, oh yeah,

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.140
the original Xbox games are like one or two gigs.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.060
Well, originally they wanted to make sure that people that did not buy hard drives were

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.780
able to put at least one game on their memory unit.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780
You know.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.100
Well, now the memory units are 512, so now they can do three hits.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.540
I don't know, it's stupid, but yeah.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.540
Or they could just do 512.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.740
Or, I don't know, you buy a hard drive like everybody fucking else, okay?

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.740
Seriously.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.740
Exactly.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:35.580
So, this is not a big surprise, I mean, the game that did so well, eventually of course

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:42.300
it would be coming to the PlayStation 3, but Bioshock is officially coming to the PS3.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:47.620
It has been rumored to be coming for a while now, and it will be due out this holiday,

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:54.940
and apparently the port, they claim, is gonna have slightly better graphics, some additional

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.340
game content.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:02.580
We'll have to see, I guess, when it comes out.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.900
But everyone should get an opportunity to play Bioshock.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.960
Absolutely.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.460
One of these days we'll have to check out Bioshock.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.300
Are they gonna do that much more special on the PlayStation 3?

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300
Probably not.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.400
It'd probably be all the stuff that was download content before, maybe add another difficulty

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.980
or something like that, who knows?

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:22.980
Alright.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.140
Let's travel around the world and discover some release dates.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.020
Loki, why don't you start us off with what's coming out in the U.S.?

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.500
Well, this week there's not a whole lot coming out, pretty much, you know, the big title

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:40.180
is gonna be Enemy Territory Quake Wars on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:44.260
Also on the Wii this week we've got Death Junior.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.260
I don't know, I don't know if I get too excited about the Death Junior game, but yes, brand

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:52.540
new Death Junior, well actually I wouldn't say it's brand new, it's a remake coming to

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.540
the Wii.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:02:00.540
There's also Emergency Heroes, which is just like Emergency Mayhem, both sort of like Crazy

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:06.540
Taxi and, I don't know, that's gonna be coming out to the Wii.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:15.380
And then this week is, I believe, Super Dodgeball Brawlers, which was a, I don't know if you

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:20.420
guys remember the original Dodgeball game on the NES, it's kinda like a sequel to that,

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.900
so that was kind of interesting.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:29.260
Let's see, also this week, Lost Planet Extreme Condition Colonies Edition, the Game of the

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:34.460
Year kind of version of it for 30 bucks, with some little additional content in there, they

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:39.220
have like a first version shooter mode and some other crap, so that's kinda neat.

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:44.740
And The Monkey King, The Legend Begins, coming out on the Wii, it's another budget game,

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:50.940
but it's a side-scroller shooter, it's all 2D hand-drawn, so that's kinda neat.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:56.100
The Metallic Rose DS Lite, coming out this week, also...

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.900
I saw a commercial on TV for the Metallic, I don't, well I think she was playing a Metallic

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:04.780
Rose or a pink DS, but it had Carrie Underwood playing Nintendogs on the DS.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.780
I don't even remember what show I was watching that shot on.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780
Did her dogs run away from her?

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.780
Does that be funny?

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.100
No, they did, she was giving them a bath and giggling, although I bet it wasn't even her

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.100
playing the game.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.380
They just had her posing with an empty DS.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.940
I'm trying to remember what the hell I was watching, they actually showed that, but I

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.940
just thought that was interesting.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.620
Because I remember there was that commercial in the UK with Nicole Kidman, but they have

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.860
one here now with Carrie Underwood, and I just thought it was interesting.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.860
Also this week, Mass Effect...

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.460
I must have been watching some girly TV show.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.620
Actually, I think it was during Ellen.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:35.300
I think I was watching Ellen when I was home sick one day and I saw that, because Ellen's

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.380
kind of a girly show, right?

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.380
Yeah.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:44.100
Also, on the PC, Mass Effect is finally coming out, so you can play that as well.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.500
Dracula Origin on PC.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:54.000
If you want to shop at GameStop, there's the USA Today Crosswords Challenge, which is a

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.340
GameStop exclusive.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:01.260
Woo wee, that's one hell of an exclusive that's put out by Destineer, who makes only good

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.260
games, I'm sure.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.660
Oh wait, no they don't.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:10.620
And then... and then that's pretty much... oh, World Championship Cards.

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:16.940
That's right, it's card games that aren't poker or blackjack.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940
Like Solitaire.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.940
Awesome.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:27.460
Oh, and there's a game called Bus Driver for the PC by Gostgame Entertainment.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.280
As long as Bus Driver has an awesome theme song, that'd be cool.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.020
I think we all know the theme song already.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.300
Rama's accusing me of watching Lifetime again.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.500
No, there haven't been any Lifetime movies recently that I've been interested in watching.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:44.260
Although I think there's a new one coming out that has... well, forget it.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.260
I love Lifetime movies.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:49.380
Aren't Lifetime movies the best?

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.300
I'm like, they're so horrible that they're good.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.300
It's like a secret shame, you know?

01:04:54.300 --> 01:05:00.900
You don't want people to know you watch that stuff, but then you're sick, or you are feeling

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:05.980
like in a bad mood, and then you put it on Lifetime, and you're like, my life is so much

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980
better than this.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.020
I think that was actually the name of a Lifetime movie.

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020
A Secret Shame.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.200
And it makes me so embarrassed to be a man.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.660
The Dark Sakura Story.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.900
Rob.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.420
What?

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.940
I have no secret shame.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:27.660
My shame is very public because I go to it once a week.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.740
A certain little garage studio.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740
Very very public shame.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.740
Rob.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.740
What?

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:42.740
They totally should make a Lifetime movie of the week about Jamie's life.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.300
Who would play Jamie?

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.740
That's the question of the day.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.340
We need an instant poll in chat.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.860
Who would play Jamie in her Lifetime movie of the week?

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.220
Someone who's sufficiently bitchy.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.140
Because I'd say Ella is a douche coup because I don't want to look like myself.

01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.140
Well I don't know.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.140
Christina Ricci.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.140
No.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.340
She's not really a celebrity, but she's a TV celebrity I guess.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:08.580
But that one chick, Mary Alice from Ace of Cakes.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580
That would work.

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580
I don't watch TV.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.580
Janine Garofalo about ten years ago.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580
Yes!

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580
I like her.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.980
I would approve of her.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.340
She's sufficiently bitchy.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.100
Jamie Summers as herself says act deaf.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.100
Margaret Cho says don't tattoo ya.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.140
Hi, I'm not Korean.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.860
I look nothing like Margaret Cho.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.900
Margaret Cho is gorgeous, but no.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.740
Rama says my best friend Patty.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.140
Tina Fey as Jamie.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.980
Oh, that's a good one.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.020
Tina Fey is the gal that she was in Mean Girls.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.780
She was the teacher with the glasses and everything.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.780
I have to look this up now.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.140
Look her up.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.140
That's a good one.

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.140
That's my favorite so far.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:49.300
Ew, Rachael Ray.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.300
That's wrong.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.300
Instant ban.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.300
No, I'm just kidding.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.300
Alright.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.940
I have a friend who has a picture of her with genius on it.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.940
Tina Fey is cute.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.940
I like her.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.940
Alright.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.620
Anyhow, release dates over in Japan.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:10.500
Coming on the Xbox 360, Battle Fantasia comes out as well as Lost Planet Colonies and Overlord

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.660
all coming out on May the 29th in Japan.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.380
Coming out on the Playstation 3, another port of Battle Fantasia.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.900
I'm not exactly sure what Battle Fantasia is.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900
I've not heard of this.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.900
Battle Fantasia just sounds awesome.

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.100
It's like a fighting game.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.100
Is it really?

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.100
It's pretty cool looking.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.100
Oh yeah.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.100
It definitely looks like a little fighting game.

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.260
There's a character called Marco who's like a little knight and Urs.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.260
The art style.

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:36.460
If you have a Japanese account, they have a Japanese demo for it which I have not played

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.460
yet.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.460
Is this by Namco?

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.580
Because the art style reminds me of Eternal Sonata like a lot.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.740
No, it's by Arc System Works.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740
Huh.

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.740
Go figure.

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.740
Be familiar with the guy.

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.740
Oh, they did Guilty Gear.

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.580
Guilty Gear and Fist of the North Star.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.780
Alright, so there you have it.

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:54.340
Cygames coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:59.100
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii Biohazard 4 Wii Edition.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.500
You might know that as Resident Evil.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.420
They call it Biohazard Overseas.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.220
Family Trainer Athletic World with Matt.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.880
Please note that is not Wii Fit but a cheap knockoff.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.660
On the Playstation 2, hey, remember Beatmania 2DX?

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.660
Remember that game?

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:15.660
Uh, what?

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.660
Remember that game?

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:23.540
14th Edition Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold finally hits the Playstation 2 on May the 29th.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.540
As well as...

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.540
I should get that.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.540
I kind of want it too.

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:27.540
Just for old times sake.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.340
I actually want Happy Sky just because it says Happy Sky.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.340
Burnout Revenge.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.780
I totally think I'm just going to buy all the Beatmania games I can that I'm missing.

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.840
Because I seriously stopped at 9th style.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.940
So I'm missing a lot.

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.820
The last I bought was 8th.

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.820
Yeah.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.820
I loved Red though.

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:42.980
Anyway, forget it.

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:49.100
Burnout Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta, because Japan needed their Def Jam Vendetta.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:54.020
Fatal Fury Battle Archives is coming out on the Playstation 2 on May 29th.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.380
Fushugi Yugi gets some new games coming out.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.380
That series.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.380
Yeah.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.380
Let it die please.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:01.380
Suzaku Ibun.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.380
No, no, no.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.380
She's still writing books.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.140
Medal of Honor.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.180
Lots and lots of stuff coming out on the...

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:12.860
By the way, there is a Konami style special edition for Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold.

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.580
It probably comes with stickers and a bunch of useless crap.

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.060
Beatmania 14 Gold poster.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.940
Oh, Beat Nation LEDs album and puzzle pieces.

01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:25.780
And Beatmania 2DX premium live DVD, the Beat Nation Summit.

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.780
That'd be cool.

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.300
That'd be kind of cool.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.460
I don't know.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.780
I don't have the love for Beatmania that I used to have.

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:37.140
I think I got really disappointed that they gave up on it in the US.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.500
I was really disappointed they gave up on it here.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.500
They could have done a lot better.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.900
Well, their biggest advocate left the company.

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:44.740
I guess that's true too.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:51.860
On the Nintendo DS, 13SaiNo, Hello Work DS, Front Mission 2089, Border of Madness.

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.860
Another Sudoku game.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860
Front Mission's awesome.

01:09:53.860 --> 01:10:00.420
Zombie Shiki, Yogo Ryoku Soushi Jutsu, English of the Dead.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.420
Oh.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.420
Good times.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.420
That sounds like...

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.420
On the Nintendo DS.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.660
I know it sounds like another game I'm thinking of.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:12.100
On the Sony PSP, I always thought this was a pretty bitchin' band that Enya used to be

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.860
in, but Clannad, it comes out on the Sony PSP.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.260
It was Enya's sister.

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.260
Was it Enya's sister?

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.260
Yeah.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.260
Clannad.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260
Let's see.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.260
What is this about?

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.260
Oh, God.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.460
It's from this company that makes dating sim games.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:33.300
Clannad has gone from Enya's sister to dating sims.

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:38.020
Memories Off and Valhalla Nights 2, all those are your Japanese release days.

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.100
After a pretty slow month in Japan, that's good that you guys are getting a lot of stuff

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.540
this week, so congrats.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.100
Japan is a winner this week.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:51.420
Honestly, I'd have to say that for the UK releases, the winning week had to have been

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:56.060
last week, so I do want to go ahead and mention a few things that are already out that people

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:00.700
should be getting or should have, and if they don't have Silent Hill Origins already, I'm

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.700
going to cry.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:06.340
Dr. Mario and Germ Buster is out on Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, My Life as a King,

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:12.060
Lost Ones, Star Soldier R, those are all really good, and the Penny Arcade game, too, is actually

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.060
on the 21st.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:18.860
Now, what we have coming out for this next release period... Oh, and by the way, they

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.860
got Rock Band.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:24.220
All the good stuff's already out, so I don't see what the point is.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220
Yeah.

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220
It was kind of an issue in the UK.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.420
They got a really big delay on Rock Band, so it's just now making its way.

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:37.380
Well, coming out on the 30th, we have Death Junior, Root of Evil, Dream Pinball, Enemy

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:44.220
Territory Quake Wars, Monster Madness Grave Digger, Pool Party, Race Driver Grind, Supreme

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:51.940
Commander, Codename Panzers Cold War, and Jamster All-Stars.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.340
Hopefully that's not the Jamster of the cell phone commercial kind.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.420
Crazy frog, probably.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.940
I'm going to look.

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.940
I have more of a curiosity.

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:04.500
Because if so, this game needs to be shot in the face.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.700
If it is that same Jamster, shoot it in the face.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.220
It needs to die in a fire.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.220
Yes.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.940
There are no... Well, Jamster's a company.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:17.780
It's Crazy Frog, and they have plenty of Crazy Frog games in the Europe interface area.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.780
Nothing yet.

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.780
That's it.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.780
All right.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.780
Let's get back into some gaming... It's over.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.780
Let's get back to some gaming news.

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.540
Metal Gear Solid 4, I made a joke earlier about the long cut scenes, but it's really not a

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.620
joke.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:33.180
Some of the cut scenes in Metal Gear Solid 4 are apparently up to 90 minutes long.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.020
The good news is you can pause them.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.020
Phew.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.020
And that might be an exaggeration.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.020
Yeah.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.440
Also, the news came out this week that that might be a slight exaggeration that it's not

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.960
really 90 minute cut scenes, but I would bet it's probably like Lost... Because Lost Odyssey

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.660
had some fucking long cut scenes in it, but they were broken up like a little bit.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.740
Like little bits here and there it was broken up.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.260
So it's probably the same type of deal in Metal Gear Solid 4.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.620
Where you play for a little bit.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:06.740
Well, some other Metal Gear Solid 4 news is that Kojima is going to be in London signing

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.140
Sleeves.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:17.320
So the release date is actually the 12th of June, and he is going to be around signing

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.580
... Let me see if it's going to be where he is at HMV's Oxford Street London store on

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.260
the 2nd of June to sign the copies.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:33.260
So it's also not just Kojima, but Yohji Shinkawa is going to be there too.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:38.780
And there's 300 sleeves available from the store on the day of the event, and it starts

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.300
at 9 o'clock AM.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:49.060
So I will personally give whatever listener who gets me one a shout out and my undying

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:57.460
affection, and I'll send you clippings from the ferret.

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.920
Just so you know, they are just like sleeves.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.820
It's not actually the game that he's signing since, you know.

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.820
That's why I said sleeves.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.220
Wait, you're going to shave the ferret?

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.300
I said clippings.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.060
Like maybe part of it's butt hair.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.060
Shave the ferret.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:14.060
That sounds like a mini game in WarioWare.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.060
Shave!

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:18.060
That sounds dirty, Rob.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.460
You're going to shave the ferret.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:27.540
Earlier, Jamie and I were talking about OLR, the RPG, and you know how like Final Fantasy

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:30.220
has like the Tetra Master card games?

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.820
Instead of the card game, you could have shave the ferret, the mini game inside of the OLR

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:35.820
RPG.

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:39.020
Or that could be like the first quest, because you know the first quest is always something

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.260
pointless to introduce you to the game's mechanics.

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:46.700
I think the first quest should be like having to take the ferret out for a shave.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:52.060
I was actually wanting to make a contest about whoever wanted to take like RPG Maker or something

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:56.140
and actually make an OLR RPG, like a full-fledged RPG.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.020
I'd be right to try.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.020
That would take a long time.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:00.020
Yeah.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.020
Exactly.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.020
It would take a long time.

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.460
Well, personally I was going to talk about, well they should have, you know that game

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.660
coming out, Blastworks, the entire game is totally customizable.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.100
We can make our own levels and stuff like that, plus they have a website that you can

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.780
upload it all to and you can download it, so.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:21.500
There's a little bit more though about this, about getting the sleeves, they're not just

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.940
giving them out.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:28.500
You will get a sleeve if you pre-order the game at HMV and the deposits for the game

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:32.300
is five pounds.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.300
Five pounds?

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.300
Five quid.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.300
All right.

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.300
Good lord, that's a lot of pounds.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.500
All right.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.500
Let's see.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.340
Well, I don't know if I can be too excited about this because it is a sports game, but

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:51.260
Madden is going to be getting a bundle, a brand new PSP coming August 12th.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:55.740
It's going to be a metallic blue PSP that's exclusive to the bundle.

01:15:55.740 --> 01:16:05.260
With it for $200, you will be getting Madden 09, an NFL In Just One Play UMD, a voucher

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:12.380
to download the game Beats off the PlayStation Store, and a one gigabyte memory stick.

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.100
From the knowledge you play too many sports games.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:19.220
I think it's kind of funny though that they include Beats on there, but you know, hey,

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.000
more power to them, I guess.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:28.220
But that is coming August 12th, so yet another PSP bundle.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.940
You know, our old friend of the show, Shane, is going to get this bundle simply because

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.940
the PSP is blue.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:33.940
It's kind of sad.

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:39.620
Is he going to put High School Musical stickers all over it?

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620
Probably.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.580
Resident Evil 5, this game looks hot.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.420
I don't know if you've seen the screenshots.

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.580
This game looks awesome.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.980
It's got that whole over the shoulder thing from Resident Evil 4, but it's now on next

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.380
gen systems, and a hot game even gets hotter.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:58.900
Apparently Resident Evil 5 is going to be featuring cooperative play mode, and that

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.820
means you can play co-op throughout the campaign.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:05.860
There's going to be also cover system mechanics in the game, so you can actually lock to a

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:08.700
wall and then fire around corners.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.220
If you're not actually playing in co-op mode, the other character in the game will be controlled

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.780
by the AI.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:14.780
That's kind of interesting.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:18.180
There's also going to be dodging that is done by the right analog stick, and apparently

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.800
the game is in these more open areas.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.740
So this game sounds pretty awesome.

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:26.580
All this information, by the way, comes from an article that was on GamesRadar, but got

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580
pulled.

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:30.180
Hmm, and you know what it means when articles get pulled.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.300
They were true the whole time.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.360
Trust us.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.860
People die?

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.960
No, that too.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.100
People don't die, they just get threatened and bullied a lot.

01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:44.700
Again, trust us, we know.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.700
I wouldn't know anything about it.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:49.260
They get taken out in the back alley and beat up a little bit.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.140
Well there's something else that should make some people happy too.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:59.340
So if you get threatening letters from Capcom, you can go hide in another series, which is

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.340
Oddworld.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.580
I know that there are fans of this series, I have not played them, but I know a lot of

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:11.100
people who love the Oddworld games.

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:16.180
And so the co-founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, said that he's working on another Oddworld

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.180
game.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:23.020
It will feature new animation- Sorry, I got really mad, I decided to shoot

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.020
Loki.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.020
Oh, okay.

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020
Ow.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.580
His foot hurts again.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.380
I was loading something in advance, because I tried to work in advance.

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:32.380
Yeah, your gun!

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:37.260
Yes, I was loading my gun.

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.260
Can I finish reading now?

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.260
Christ.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.260
All right, yes you can.

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:41.260
Sorry.

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:43.700
I didn't mean for that to happen.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.700
Yeah, right.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.400
Anyway, they're saying that basically the visuals are going to be about the same as

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.900
what you'd expect in a good CGI feature film.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:59.180
This is, the quote says from Braun, the rendering tools are getting so good now for 3D animation

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:03.300
you can literally create a linear animation and create a video game using the exact same

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.300
objects.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.180
That's pretty cool.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.040
So I might have to check this one out myself, but they're basically saying that it could

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.720
be a few years before the project's complete.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:18.340
They're also saying though, the hint is that the Oddworld games to be released in the future

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.900
are going to be episodic.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.740
So that's kind of nifty.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:25.740
All right.

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:28.380
It worked for Sam and Max.

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.980
Well speak of episodic.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.700
It did not work for Shenmue.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:40.300
Well speaking of episodic content, Horlor, you may remember them of the World of Warcraft,

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.700
apparently they got sued so they had to change their name, but Horlor, the fantasy porn series

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:50.340
that's out there now that is based off of World of Warcraft, now they're branching off

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.940
into a new online game to parody I guess in porn.

01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:02.140
And that would be the Age of Conan with their brand new series, Horlor Presents, the Rage

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.620
of Bonan.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:11.860
And it will actually feature the first episode, well lots of boning, but yeah the first episode

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.940
is apparently going to be a recreation of one of the missions that you go on in the

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:21.300
beginning of the game where you have to rescue some chick who is apparently tied up and then

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:26.260
accept and this, they have sex with her, so interesting.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:31.340
But I mean, you know, they have some pretty interesting names for their episodes and stuff

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:36.160
like the first one, I remember Horlor, or World of Warcraft, the first one Rogues Do

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.580
It From Behind, gotta love that, and the nice Pirate Booty, yes.

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:46.220
But if you're interested and you're of age, you can download these and purchase them at

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.580
Horlor.com.

01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:52.500
You know, I was just thinking, it's been a while since we've had a video game porn crossover

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.460
story because, you know, I was just, don't ask me why, but I was thinking the other day

01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:02.100
about Final Fuck X and how hilarious that porno was, have you ever seen Final Fuck X?

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.100
This is great.

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.100
Remember Dance Dance Fuck?

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.380
It's basically boning some cosplayers.

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:10.720
Yes, it's basically, it's Japanese porno and it's basically these girls are dressed up

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:15.780
like Yuna and Riku and Lulu and they get fucked.

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:19.700
I don't think it's the Final Fuck though, I think the title's a little deceiving.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.220
I have a feeling they get fucked again.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.820
And in case you haven't ever seen these before, they do have pictures all night and they do

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:29.020
have the elf ears too, so it's like a, you know, a fanboy.

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:35.020
They're very, very great costumes, they're really, no seriously, it's just very, very

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.020
smart.

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:41.620
I remember one week, if you, in OLR history, I remember one week when we reviewed Dance

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:45.340
Dance Fuck live on air, because you actually got this porno somehow.

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:49.660
I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay, and I saw this and I'm like, I gotta

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.660
buy this.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.180
There's actually a porno called Dance Dance Fuck, but they don't actually ever play Dance

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.180
Dance Revolution.

01:21:55.180 --> 01:22:01.780
No, it has the font, and then it's like Dance Dance Fuck like six max or something.

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:05.660
Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck six max or something like that, it was so funny.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:11.260
Until you've seen live action Smurf porn, you ain't seen shit.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:17.100
But anyways, this company also, just so you know, they do have the first FPS porn as well.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:24.140
They have FPS porn episode one, and it is done in the style of an FPS shooter, so.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.140
One has to wonder what the gun is.

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.780
That is interesting.

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:31.780
Eight bucks, that's not bad.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780
Very nice.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:38.260
That's the sound a lot of people will be making after watching it too.

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:45.060
Alright, anyhow, a sound I'm gonna make right now is a very happy noise, a very happy bouncy

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.060
noise.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:51.020
Oh, oh, oh, real quick, sorry, and I forgot to add one thing.

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.020
You're interrupting his bouncy noise.

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:53.740
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:58.780
In the Age of Conan, they actually have a guild for Horlor as well, and if you wanna

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:03.740
sign up for their guild for Age of Conan, it's HorlorGuild.com.

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:06.140
So yes, you too can be part of the Horlor.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:07.140
Nice.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:15.100
Alright, anyhow, I said happy music, so it's time to bring in the music that always marks

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.900
our classic game of the week.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.220
Yes, that's right, it's the segment where Dark Soccer digs through the archives and

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:26.180
picks a favorite classic game from gaming history to praise live here on air.

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.040
So Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.540
The game that everybody should be playing is Typing of the Dead with bad voice acting.

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.540
Yes, and that was what the gunshot was from, I apologize.

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.540
The meeting G over there.

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.540
What?

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:55.980
Even the little baby voice sucks, but Typing of the Dead is a modification of House of

01:23:55.980 --> 01:24:02.660
the Dead 2, which is the first person rail shooter, except in this one, phrases and words

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.860
pop up and you have to type them to kill them.

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:11.000
I've played an arcade version of this, it's quite difficult since I'm not too familiar

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.140
with a Japanese keyboard, but I have the Dreamcast version of this game that you play with the

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:23.300
Dreamcast keyboard and it's just really cracktastic and fun and kind of difficult really as you

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:26.820
get to the boss battles because you have to be really freaking fast.

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:31.620
On top of that you have to be really freaking accurate, because if you type wrong, then

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:37.620
it won't put it in until you type it correctly.

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:42.940
But I like that when they're walking around they have Dreamcasts on their back and keyboards

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.260
in front of them instead of carrying their guns around.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:48.220
Unless you play the PC version, of course you can on game test.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.780
PC versions kind of ask, but...

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.500
Hey, but it's all I got.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:58.300
Yeah, I can bring over my Dreamcast one day, but anyway, Typing of the Dead was just really

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:03.380
fun, and it's so just...

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:09.700
I guess it's good, it's just absurd basically, it's stupid, but it's really fun.

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:13.260
And on top of that it has the worst voice acting ever which makes it even better.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.260
My God.

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:19.540
I was like, there was nothing we could do.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540
It's that epic.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.820
I don't want to die.

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.780
I remember playing a game like this once at Arcade Infinity, I don't know if it was still

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.780
Typing of the Dead.

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:27.780
No, the one they had was Typing of the Dead.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780
But it was in Japanese.

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.780
Yeah.

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.780
Okay.

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:31.780
But it was the same game, just in Japanese.

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:39.340
Well, the first few levels, if I do recall right, were mostly in English, but it was

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.820
as you get the boss battles that they were using the...

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.340
Yo, you could type, you could type, because they used English letters, it was just the

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.420
Japanese words, so you could type it, you could play through the game, but when you

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:54.300
got to the boss, there's one boss that asks questions, and that was the part where you

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.900
always got screwed.

01:25:58.900 --> 01:25:59.900
So there you have it.

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:07.780
I also like that if you know how House of the Dead has little things you can find, well,

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.100
they actually pop up as a letter to the head, I think that's pretty cool.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:12.100
That is cool.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.100
I like that.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.100
But I freaking love Typing of the Dead.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.100
I think it's about time that this game got some respect.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:22.060
All right, so there you have it, Typing of the Dead, your classic game of the week, available

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.380
on Dreamcast, which is the preferred version for Jamie, or PC, if you must.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.260
Everything is better on Dreamcast.

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:30.540
All right.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.540
Very good pick.

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.820
Again, I'm surprised that that has never been picked before.

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.940
Well, it hasn't been doing this that long.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:36.940
I guess so.

01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:37.940
But there you go.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:38.940
All right.

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.940
Basically, you wanna know how we came across it?

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:40.940
How we decided to?

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.940
What's that?

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.940
Because we went in the vault.

01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.940
Ah.

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.940
Went in the vault.

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.940
Tiara's nodding her head.

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:46.940
Did you make Tiara go in the vault?

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:47.940
Yeah.

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:48.940
Tiara's like, I was in the vault.

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:49.940
It was dark.

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:50.940
It was cold.

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:51.940
They tried to lock me in the vault.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.780
I grabbed a stack of games.

01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.780
And shot them in my head.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.780
And just kept going through them.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.780
Yeah, I did.

01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.780
And it was fun.

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.180
But I kept going through them until I found Typing of the Dead.

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.180
All right.

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.820
But there were other games there that I might do later.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.540
Well, that's gonna do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:08.540
But don't go away.

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.500
We got plenty more to come in part B. There's still some more gaming news that we're gonna

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.600
be talking about.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.600
So stay tuned.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.940
I mean, we haven't talked really about the Wii a whole lot yet.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.540
There's a lot of Wii news going on this week.

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:23.300
Some other, the big piracy chip that's supposed to end piracy all together.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.300
We're gonna talk about that.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.740
I'm sure Loki has something he wants to say about that.

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:27.740
And movies.

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.740
Lots of game movie crossovers.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:36.700
And yes, the whole Xbox shenanigans around the guy whose name happened to be kinda gay.

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:40.500
We'll talk about that all in part B after a quick break.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.500
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:48.020
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.020
a week.

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:53.260
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
