15916	24749	The New Nintendo Channel is up and running, Burnout Paradise is soon headed to the PC, and the classic first-person shooter is about to get another sequel.
31570	36412	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36472	43234	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43334	44834	It's where every gamer has a voice.
45394	46835	My name is Rob Roberts.
46875	51156	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
51976	52477	Hi.
52797	53177	How are you?
54117	54657	I'm tired.
54837	55337	You're tired?
56118	56918	Been a long weekend?
56938	57018	Yeah.
58004	59646	It's been a long everything.
59946	65251	It's been a hot weekend too, and I'm worried about next weekend because it's supposed to be like 20 degrees hotter.
65571	69916	And I'm like, we're going to die during the show, so I've got to figure out air conditioning plans.
69936	70676	I have a solution for you.
70757	71077	What's that?
72218	74040	That window, does it have a screen?
74540	77861	It does have a screen on it, so you can't do a little thingy, I know.
78402	78662	No.
78722	80162	You can kick that screen off there.
80222	80963	Take the screen off.
81223	83244	Put it in the air conditioner, put a block over it.
83624	84284	It's not that hard.
84304	86625	See those little black things on there?
86785	86985	Yeah.
87085	88246	That's for pushing the screen off.
88846	89166	We'll see.
89426	89666	All right.
90106	92087	This is now Home Improvement, the podcast.
92107	94848	Well, and on top of that, it's Studio Improvement.
94908	98330	The other voice you hear over there, Tech Master Loki, since he's talking out of turn.
99150	99530	That's all right.
99870	101011	I'm talking in turn.
101758	103679	But it's easy and cheap.
103959	104740	They're not expensive.
105620	106400	I'll figure something out.
106420	107341	That's why we have a budget!
107641	108762	I got a week to figure it out.
111063	112824	Which means I'll do something about it on Saturday.
113784	115305	I'll worry about it tomorrow.
115665	116486	And how are you doing, Loki?
117686	118227	I'm doing fine.
118567	118747	Yeah?
118987	119447	Had a good week?
120308	121108	Uh, yeah, I guess.
121408	122669	Alright, all things considered.
122969	124110	You went out of town today, right?
124350	126691	Yeah, I went to Oakland and then I came back from Oakland.
126711	127711	And you're back alive!
127812	128252	Amazing.
129198	129878	Oakland sucks.
154392	155352	and I helped by taking pictures of stuff.
184304	186166	It's a pinball table and I helped.
196192	201894	I haven't been video game shopping in a while I have enough games to hold me over I'm just gonna pretend that it's not dude, you know, playing him
226724	228265	It's not, what, Robert Downey Jr.?
228365	230126	You're not a big... I thought you loved the movie.
230466	230786	I do.
231206	232007	But you just don't like him.
232227	234528	Oh, okay.
234548	234828	Whatever.
234848	236029	But I'm going to take you to see it.
236569	236849	I will.
236929	238610	I can do it tomorrow.
238810	239431	We're going tomorrow.
239451	239991	I can do it tomorrow.
240171	241952	I don't know, because... Oh.
242312	243713	Yeah, somebody's back in town tomorrow.
243733	244673	I've got to go hang with them.
244733	245634	All right, we'll go this week.
246482	246742	We will.
247202	250224	I still kind of want to see Speed Racer even though everything I've heard about it is terrible.
250384	251565	I've been hearing a lot of people like it.
251585	252466	Did you see it, Loki?
252486	253006	It was awesome.
253086	253406	Was it?
253666	256728	See, now I heard you wouldn't like Speed Racer unless you're a seven-year-old boy.
256748	257529	I hate Speed Racer.
257669	260050	I absolutely hate the cartoon and I like the movie.
260211	265574	See, I like Speed Racer because it's done by Tatsunoko Studios and that's the place that gave us Gatchaman.
266232	267133	Speed Racer X
291541	293782	Uh, not really, but it's cool.
294622	295602	It's cool in its own right.
295622	298143	As long as the Mach 5 has all of its crap, I'm happy.
298263	299603	You know, that's the game they need to make.
299663	303624	I want to see a game like F-Zero, but on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
304244	308325	Well, there was Fatal Inertia, but that was kind of eh.
309065	314087	I want to see something that'll just blow my mind with how great the graphics are and all that.
314107	319288	It was supposed to be blow-my-mind awesome, but it was blow-my-mind average, so...
320672	327076	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
337722	358731	and you can actually um you know rank up i think all the way to level 10 so i have a long ways to go there i like how they do it it's basically just experience or i guess money that you earn throughout the game so you can play you know for quite a while there's a few lag issues i ran into overall it's pretty good um i just absolutely love that game what can i say um
359758	362320	Other than Grand Theft Auto, I did get to play a few other games today.
363040	366403	I played God of War Chains of Olympus, and that's pretty cool.
366563	373048	I played mainly the demo before, so it was nice to actually get to play the full game.
373088	374669	If you like God of War, you're going to love this game.
374689	381714	It's absolutely amazing to see that they were able to put a God of War game onto the PSP and not really sacrifice anything, so that was pretty cool.
382554	387198	And then, of course, more Space Invaders Extreme, and that game is just all sorts of awesome.
387338	387498	So...
389724	390404	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
390444	395287	I've been trying this week to get around playing Speed Racer for the Wii.
395827	399309	And especially after last night, it was funny because Nellie went and saw the movie with me.
399490	401511	And she's like, do they have a game for this?
402311	403812	I'm like... Wait, wait, wait.
403832	404092	Hold on.
404492	409655	Your wife, who hates games that aren't called Bejeweled or Zuma, wanted to go buy a video game.
409675	410616	She likes Excite Truck.
411061	412481	Oh yeah, I forgot she liked Excite Truck too.
412541	416862	Well, she said that this would be perfect if they had Excite Truck, but with those tracks.
417102	418602	She's like, that would be perfect.
418762	420163	I'm like, well, they have a game for it.
420383	421863	I'm not sure if it's like Excite Truck.
421883	424684	I'm pretty sure it's not, but you can try it anyways.
424844	426004	But does she like Mario Kart?
426784	427944	She hasn't played Mario Kart yet.
428064	428664	I don't think she would.
428804	430845	She loves Excite Truck.
430925	432925	Is your wife a fan of Monster Trucks or something?
433205	435345	No, she just likes the gameplay of that.
435566	437586	And I hope to God they announce a sequel because...
438496	439437	That game needs a sequel.
439817	441899	Frisbee says Excite Truck should come down in price.
442940	443301	It should.
443521	445463	Has it not come down in price after all this time?
445883	446403	I don't think so.
446624	446924	Wow.
447184	448425	It's Excite Truck Chanel.
449046	449526	Amazing.
450007	452149	As far as I remember, it's not being sold anymore.
453150	454331	Alright, so anything else for your gaming week?
455840	456701	Thank you for watching!
473092	474314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
492055	492976	And it was a lot of fun.
516917	518818	I had a lot of fun playing Mario Kart Online with them.
518938	519759	Of course, I won.
520159	521200	I made it even more fun.
521280	522381	No, I lost battle mode, though.
522401	523942	They whooped me in battle, but I won the race mode.
524222	525243	I don't like battle mode.
525403	526824	It's not as cool as it used to be.
526844	533788	The battle mode is not nearly as cool as it used to be, but the game... I'd consider versus mode like the game itself, and that's great.
533848	534849	I love the courses.
535009	536190	I love the new courses.
536290	537451	They're all so good.
537831	543615	I still stand by not really caring for their selection of retro courses that they brought back.
543795	544816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
572000	572340	I don't know.
572740	577141	And I really think that there was a few tracks in there that they should have brought in.
578041	579781	Maybe he had taken a vote or something?
579801	580762	See, now, but here's the thing.
580842	588683	If Nintendo was smart about their online strategy, they would have downloadable tracks, and they could do more retro stuff.
588703	591704	Yes, and that's the key phrase, if they were smart.
592044	598865	But the thing is, they're not, and they're playing it way too damn safe, and there's not going to be downloadable content available for these games.
599727	600508	for quite a while.
600648	613559	And there is one game, and that's coming up in the show roll, about download content that... I know that there's a service that they're... Well, they already unveiled it or announced it, but it's not being implemented until the summer.
613699	619644	Well, here's the other weird thing is that, you know, they've got another problem on that Wii to figure out, and that's the fact that I ran out of space on my Wii this week.
619704	624569	Now, granted, I've downloaded, like, crap loads of virtual console games because I'm a whore for retro games.
625149	641631	and you know every channel they released and when I finally copied the Mario Kart channel or I wanted to or no no I copied the Mario Kart channel and then when that new channel came out this week that we're going to talk about later I ran out of space I couldn't install it I had to go back and delete so I've already filled up my Wii and WiiWare's not even up yet
643527	645088	They've got a storage problem on top of everything.
645168	647389	I don't know how the hell I'm going to fit download content on that thing.
647850	649331	Luckily, the WiiWare games aren't that large.
649811	651432	Like, under 48 megs.
651572	657056	I mean, I'm going to have to copy the virtual console games to my card and copy them over to one of my players.
657136	658857	It's just such a hassle.
659897	663760	One little patch is all it would take to use that SD card as a normal memory.
664080	664480	Seriously.
664740	666461	Yep, and that's Nintendo, though, for you.
666642	669203	If it works and it's a hassle, that's okay for us.
669744	670744	Just like the Friends codes.
670824	671865	It works, but it's a hassle.
673510	680256	Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, the man that precedes us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights when we tape live, he goes live at 5 o'clock Pacific.
680436	681117	He's calling me out.
681177	682598	He says, I would beat you, Sky.
683298	683459	Well...
684326	686267	I see that challenge, Mr. Blackwolf.
686307	688067	We'll set up a challenge this week at some point.
688668	690728	I'm actually not that great at Mario Kart.
690749	691509	I want to play.
691549	691789	Okay.
692329	692769	Well, I'll play.
692949	695310	Hey, this can be the Chromehounds event that never was.
695610	697851	Well, I'm not that great at Mario Kart, but I'll play.
697951	698251	We'll play.
698271	698732	It'll be fun.
699452	699912	All right, Bobby.
700232	700952	Let's set up a time.
700972	704494	Especially, you know, and that's another thing that I don't really care about this Mario Kart.
705660	716488	The fact that the AI is retarded and the item selection is also retarded, because when you're up in the first place, you get nothing, and when you're in the last place, it's like, Blue Shell, Blue Shell, Blue Shell, Blue Shell.
716628	717329	Yeah.
718089	719210	Blue Shells need to die to fire.
719871	721692	Other Nintendo games I've been playing this week.
721752	723013	I picked up a game for $15 at Costco.
724914	727216	It's the Williams pinball table collection.
727256	728617	I don't think that's the actual name of the game.
728658	729158	I apologize.
729178	730579	But you can't miss it.
730639	733462	It's the pinball collection featuring all the Williams tables.
733742	736144	So not only did DarkSakura have a pinball week, I did too.
736464	738966	And I played the shit out of pinball.
739247	741448	That was awesome to get to play that again.
741869	750216	And for the value, considering I only paid $15 for it, and I imagine it's $19.99 normally because Costco marks everything down, it's not a bad deal at all.
751377	752477	with all the tables you get in there.
752497	753858	You have a lot of retro tables in there.
754699	764866	When you consider that Pinball FX on Xbox Live is $10, and they're very similar, but in the case of the Wii One, you get to play games you remember and love.
764906	765386	It's kind of cool.
766087	768208	I've got to tell you, the control scheme is kind of funny.
769489	770129	Funny in a good way.
770610	780196	What you do, you use the Wii and the Nunchuck, I mean the Wiimote and the Nunchuck, and the trigger on the Wiimote is the right flipper, and then the little trigger on the Nunchuck is the left flipper.
780456	781117	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
802372	803513	Which I think is interesting.
803814	810561	If you get 100,000 points on this table, then you get a credit to play the tournament games.
811121	812123	Which I thought was kind of cute.
812703	815346	I think it's good that they have that on the analog.
816467	822233	For example, Pinbot, like you were saying, has the spiral on it to where it's not the very top one.
822294	824536	It's like the second to last one gives you more points.
824656	825397	Right, skill shots.
825577	825777	Yeah.
825917	827478	Tons of pinball games have skill shots.
827618	828920	The older ones, not so much.
828980	830781	It was just kind of about which chute would it go down to.
830821	832843	But yeah, Pinbot and some of the other later ones.
833623	834925	But it's got some great tables in it.
835005	835685	A Whirlwind.
835985	836466	Remember that one?
836486	837106	That one was fun.
838027	838868	We almost bought a Whirlwind.
839048	839168	Oh.
839668	846094	But the good thing about Whirlwind, though, is that you actually want to have the real table for that so that when you go inside after being outside all day and the wind blows on you.
846114	847115	Yes, it actually blows the wind at you.
847155	848416	And unfortunately, the Wii doesn't do that.
849056	849377	Sad.
849817	850477	But it's good times.
850497	850578	Yeah.
851542	853603	So what else was all on that collection?
853983	854963	Oh, gosh.
855143	856484	Black Knight, I know, was there.
857344	859525	Taxi, AJ Mix is pointing out in chat.
859545	860365	I guess they looked it up.
862086	862486	Let's see.
862566	869148	Actually, Actdeft is linking me to a page that has more information about the game because I'm too lazy to go grab my copy of the game.
869589	871409	It has some really old tables in it, too.
871469	872270	Like, what is the one?
872590	874651	There's one with, like, a giant Satan on it.
875511	876691	It's a very early, early table on it.
878792	880675	As long as it doesn't have Hyperball, then I'm okay.
880695	881296	Gorgar.
881817	883339	The first ever talking pinball machine.
883359	884521	That's the one with Satan on it.
885863	888486	Space Shuttle is on there too.
888506	889688	Yeah, I'm looking at the list.
889949	890549	Good times.
891231	893013	Let's see which of these I own.
893033	893934	No, I'm kidding.
895069	898551	But seriously, for the value, it's a great value.
898611	903753	Especially when you consider there's a very comparable game where the tables aren't quite as memorable.
903833	904494	I mean, don't get me wrong.
904534	908616	I like Pinball FX, but it's not quite as memorable as some of these tables.
908656	909997	I mean, they're classic tables for a reason.
911377	914439	Sadly, the Tommy table is not in the game, DJ Dark Knight.
915179	916920	The Tommy table is freaking awesome.
917020	920082	If you like pinball at all, it's worth the money to get this for the Wii.
920242	920582	It's fun.
921202	922303	That's my thoughts on that.
922323	924504	It was the big thing about Black Knight, the Magna save.
924943	948595	mm-hmm mm-hmm they sent us the wrong magnet safe stickers all right so that's gonna do it for my gaming week because otherwise I was just playing World of Warcraft and usual by the way World of Warcraft accomplishment are you ready I got my epic flight form on my druid this week 5,000 gold down the crapper here's your applause ready all right thank you I got one clap
950973	954277	Alright, let's get to some housekeeping and then we'll get to the gaming news tonight.
954637	955278	Hey, guess what?
955338	956279	The All Games...
957540	960462	BlackWolf says, I thought that was a slap, not a clap
986030	988152	GS68 says some jackass columnist for Time compared WoW to Scrabulist.
997325	998105	DarkSakura
1022068	1026129	So we're doing a brand new game tonight, and I haven't seen... We're doing Bumper Stumpers.
1026269	1027029	Well, here's the thing.
1027449	1029610	We need to get that res code away.
1029670	1034811	So I was going to have FootyMonster battle Toshin tonight, and I see FootyMonster's in chat, so I know he's good to go.
1035151	1037112	I don't see Toshin, so I'm a little worried.
1037992	1040592	But we're giving away that damn code tonight, even if it kills me.
1040912	1042233	Ew!
1042413	1042973	What are you ewing?
1043113	1045193	Funhaus is in that collection, and I hate that game.
1045253	1046214	Funhaus is cool, shut up.
1046234	1047414	Because his stupid head.
1048123	1048323	All right.
1048543	1051186	We'll give you more details on the game in Part B when we play the game.
1053147	1053948	And let's see.
1054529	1054889	That's it.
1054989	1058913	Otherwise, we always have our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio on MySpace.
1059713	1061895	Our live journal community is Orange Lounge.
1062015	1062416	No radio.
1062436	1063417	We're also on Facebook.
1063437	1065098	Just search for O-L-R-M-E.
1065578	1066359	O-L-R-M-Y.
1067200	1067480	All right.
1067540	1068201	Gaming news.
1068541	1069562	We had a lot this week.
1070163	1070763	Take it away, Loki.
1071063	1071304	Yes.
1072164	1074406	Of course, as Rob was mentioning,
1075367	1079949	When he tried to install the Nintendo Channel, his Wii said, no, you're out of space.
1080669	1085730	But the Nintendo Channel, or as it's known in Japan, everybody's Nintendo Channel.
1086371	1087991	Fuck that, it's my Nintendo Channel now.
1089532	1090792	Is available on the Wii.
1091232	1094193	It will allow you to rate different games.
1094693	1095654	I think Wii...
1096394	1105240	WeWare games, Virtual Console, and full Wii games after you've played them for an hour, as well as there's going to be some, I think, video that you can watch of different games.
1106121	1113246	I think the coolest thing, though, that you'll probably see available for it is DS demo downloads, which is pretty awesome.
1113266	1117288	You can stream those to your DS just like a download station.
1118669	1119710	So go check it out.
1119870	1123713	It's absolutely free, and who doesn't like demos?
1124281	1126382	Free if you sell your soul to Nintendo.
1127522	1127842	Yes.
1128142	1132404	Yes, because you have to agree that the thing will, I don't know, monitor.
1132464	1133084	What the hell is it doing?
1133124	1137606	It's sending anonymous usage data about the games you've been playing.
1137666	1141187	So you know how the Wii's been secretly compiling the amount of time?
1141207	1144349	You can go to that note in your board, and you can see how long you've been playing the games?
1144589	1147730	Well, that information gets sent to Nintendo, and in turn, you get the list of DS games.
1147750	1148870	You're like, you don't do it?
1148970	1149370	No games.
1149591	1150551	No DS demos for you.
1152236	1153116	I mean, I don't know.
1153516	1154957	Like, I'm not too worried about it.
1154997	1156117	I gladly clicked yes.
1156157	1156878	I mean, I don't care.
1157158	1170503	I mean, seriously, what is Nintendo going to do knowing that some, you know, schmo in Sacramento, California was playing way too much, you know, And they'll know that I like Excite Truck and then they'll go, hey, people like Excite Truck, let's make another one.
1170643	1171763	And that's not a bad thing.
1171983	1175008	I think it's fairly smart of them to have something like that enacted.
1175048	1182479	It's a good way to... I think it's a good non-intrusive way, I think, for market research.
1182819	1183160	Exactly.
1183240	1186725	This isn't like EA where it's like, hey, we've got your credit card number.
1187674	1188715	We want to know what you're buying.
1189115	1193599	True, I don't think Nintendo saves your credit card information because you have to input it every freaking time.
1194500	1197963	Once again, it works, but it's an inconvenience.
1201126	1202467	Did you actually check out the channel?
1202707	1204308	Nope, did not download it.
1204348	1205109	Didn't even plug it in.
1205149	1206690	Too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 4.
1206931	1211254	I did download it, and it wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped.
1211635	1214417	They have some videos on there, which is kind of interesting to see on the Wii.
1215658	1217480	Isn't that just a recurring theme with the Wii?
1217560	1219842	It wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped.
1231511	1232351	Okay, seriously.
1232511	1233192	It was interesting.
1233492	1234452	Yes, I'm glad.
1234572	1236012	It's an interesting thing.
1236112	1241294	It's also something they talked about E3 prior to the Wii launching that this was already supposed to have happened at launch.
1241974	1243315	What's taking them so long?
1243515	1246176	I mean, seriously, what is taking them so long to implement this crap?
1247816	1252498	It's like, oh, well, eventually we'll get a unified online service and stuff.
1252598	1252938	Oh, great.
1252998	1255158	I'm glad that you're catching up to Microsoft.
1255659	1256879	It'll only be a few years now.
1258069	1265551	Well, maybe they just had some fine-tuning to do or something, or maybe they just kind of rushed the Wii out there, and now there's only so many people that work there.
1265571	1267232	People aren't interested in online.
1267252	1268232	What are they talking about?
1268752	1270813	Xbox Live statistics are bullshit.
1270833	1272033	They're pulling it out of their ass.
1274154	1274494	All right.
1275234	1276514	I'm looking at chat here.
1276655	1278035	Actdeft says, I like the channel.
1278075	1278855	I like the demos.
1279595	1284897	AJ Mix says, demos is pretty much the high point, and it has the commercial that has the kid that says, I am Mudkip.
1286414	1287055	I missed that.
1287895	1288976	I have to go back and look.
1291358	1302207	I mean, I was thinking like, wow, it'd be kind of cool if there was like a YouTube-ish channel where cute little viral things could be on there, but then I'm thinking, oh, but there's the internet channel, so I could just go to YouTube on the internet channel.
1303948	1304469	Why bother?
1305029	1308492	And then four hours later, you'll be able to watch the latest viral videos.
1310948	1311428	Exactly.
1312389	1312729	All right.
1313289	1315051	Other stuff going on in the Wii world.
1315231	1321995	And a lot of fanboys, including myself, have been eagerly anticipating the release someday of Kid Icarus on the Wii.
1322315	1327958	And here's the thing is that it may have actually been spoiled this week by IGN.
1328299	1333121	You know that guy over at IGN who's, you know, he's like the quintessential Nintendo fanboy.
1333161	1334582	Not that that's an issue, but he just is.
1334642	1336183	Matt Casamassana?
1336423	1337364	Is that how you say his name?
1337844	1339165	Casamassana.
1339185	1339886	Casamassana.
1340728	1343891	All right, he probably heard that like a million times in the third grade, Loki.
1343931	1344211	Come on.
1344592	1351478	All right, so this guy, he was in the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast.
1351898	1353260	First off, Nintendo has voice chat?
1353280	1353700	That's amazing.
1354061	1356383	No, they name all their podcasts after stuff.
1356803	1358345	Like they have, was it the...
1360273	1365317	I want to say Red Ring of Death is their Xbox 360 podcast.
1365417	1365657	Nice.
1366237	1366678	Oh, I see.
1366738	1370341	So they make fun of the system in their name.
1370881	1373203	And then the PlayStation 3 crayon-eating cast.
1373223	1373483	I don't know.
1373523	1374324	All right, fine, whatever.
1374604	1376765	The IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast.
1376805	1380908	He says in this, of course, Nintendo's going to have some E3 surprises.
1380968	1383130	You know, Kid Icarus for crying out loud.
1383170	1384531	How many times do we have to say it?
1384951	1386352	It's coming out for crying out loud.
1387341	1395048	So, you know, and you kind of think this guy might kind of know something going on on the inside because usually, you know, these really big gaming sites are kind of in on what's to know.
1395969	1400514	It really wouldn't surprise... There's been little breadcrumb clues to that this is going to happen.
1400534	1402195	A, he showed up in Brawl.
1402255	1403676	That should be a big clue right there.
1403837	1404958	I honestly think that's a clue.
1405638	1411964	And we heard that, what was it, Factor 5, I think, was developing an unknown game that was suspected to be this.
1413546	1423915	And then, I guess on the next show, the same guy, he actually said, Kid Icarus, that's another one I'm really anticipating, just because I love the franchise, and I'm sure the developer will make a really pretty game.
1424696	1428119	So he said it twice, that it's coming.
1428179	1430501	Maybe if I keep seeing stuff, it'll come too.
1430841	1432803	Some things say they're coming and never do, so...
1433243	1441930	All right, well, I can't wait for, I cannot wait for Compile to reform and have a booth at E3 this year and announce Guardian Legend 2.
1442331	1442931	I can't wait for that.
1443652	1444773	That's going to be the show winner right there.
1444793	1447355	Technically, there was a Guardian Legend 2, so we went Guardian Legend 3.
1447975	1448736	What was Guardian Legend 2?
1449757	1451458	The Guardian Legend that we got over here in the US.
1452159	1452699	Oh, yeah.
1452719	1453820	The first one was Guardic.
1453840	1455081	Guardic, or whatever.
1455682	1456643	So, just letting you know.
1456783	1456903	Just
1457287	1462029	Get together and make a new game that is like Zelda plus shooter.
1462209	1462950	And that would be awesome.
1463690	1463930	All right.
1464450	1465351	And let's see.
1466491	1469453	Now, something that didn't make our little list, but I know I saw it on the internet.
1469473	1472014	There was like some concept artwork that supposedly leaked.
1472094	1473034	Although, I don't know.
1473074	1474655	Some of it kind of screamed fanboy to me.
1475051	1483499	No, it was actually, it was stuff that they were, it was a company pitching the idea of a Kid Icarus game, and they sent off a bunch of different shots.
1483879	1484100	Hmm.
1484720	1488043	But, like, it was weird, because if you've seen the shots, Pit looks all, like, buff.
1488584	1494509	Well, they have a bunch of different styles of shots and stuff, so it's not just that super buff one that you're seeing.
1495430	1499354	And it was from a website, Combo, with a K. Okay.
1500849	1504513	and I guess not to be confused with Zombo.
1505174	1506795	There was another website that had some stuff.
1509502	1514306	They said that, I guess it was supposedly from Factor 5, where those pieces of artwork came.
1514626	1518389	And they have, like I said, a bunch of different shots.
1518469	1531180	There's some that look really realistic, there's one that looks like a really shitty cartoon, there's some emo shots, something that looks like it might have been out of Kingdom Hearts, you know, just like a whole bunch of stuff.
1531420	1533742	But yeah, some of it looks a little bit fanboyish, but...
1535529	1540771	It's slowly... A fact that a Kid Icarus game would be coming to Wii in the first place is a little fanboyish, don't you think?
1542071	1542391	I don't know.
1542571	1542851	It is.
1543351	1546692	Hey, I will be first in line to pre-order and then thusly buy this game.
1546712	1549313	Because I love the original 8-bit that much.
1549473	1553154	Well, you know, since they have the characters from Mother in there, maybe Mother 3's coming here.
1554074	1554294	No.
1555475	1556615	Why you gotta be a dick?
1557995	1563037	I'm not the one that's saying, hey, let's localize a game for Europe and I'll bring it to the U.S.
1564071	1567415	Import time FTW.
1569037	1580189	Anywho, for those who have been waiting for WiiWare, we have a bit of a release from Nintendo giving us some ideas of what's definitely going to be out for the launch of WiiWare.
1580910	1583973	And if you are ready, has them.
1585075	1585315	Okay.
1585578	1596965	Defender Castle, 500 Wii Points, Pop for 700 Wii Points, VIP Casino Blackjack for 700, TV Show King for 1,000, whatever.
1597025	1597246	What?
1597606	1598206	TV Show King.
1598266	1599367	I think that's a trivia game.
1600167	1601268	For 1,000 points.
1601548	1606591	Now, I like Defender Castle, and that's 500 points, and then TV Show King.
1606912	1607272	All right.
1607772	1608733	Is that going to be like Seen It?
1609617	1610657	Lost Winds for $1,000.
1610697	1612318	I like it pretty good.
1612838	1616080	And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a King for $15.
1616980	1618821	That I'm not too sure if it looked good or not.
1619001	1620401	I'm not buying that at a protest.
1620441	1621562	There's no Dr. Mario.
1622382	1623343	What is wrong with this picture?
1623363	1626044	I thought Dr. Mario was like a late add to the list or something.
1626184	1627044	Yeah, but still.
1628145	1628665	It's coming.
1629225	1631426	I need to throw pills at Viri.
1632687	1633787	And you can do it on the internet.
1634487	1634747	Yes.
1635568	1636088	It'll be fun.
1637146	1637987	Thank you for watching.
1638027	1638647	See you next time.
1654920	1657122	Talking a little bit about Castlevania for the Wii.
1658062	1674333	A second link, also coming from another Brazilian site, apparently has some quotes from Shinji Hirano, an executive VP for Konami USA, stating that Castlevania titles were headed to the Wii and DS.
1674933	1682538	He says that we'll learn more information about these titles come next week, when Konami is holding a press event in the US.
1684324	1686145	Goddammit, where's my invite for this shit?
1686726	1687066	Seriously?
1688767	1695251	Now, they promised us that when a Castlevania game was going to be coming that you would not actually have to use the Wiimote as a whip, right?
1695271	1696652	Because that would be the most hokey thing ever.
1698313	1703756	Yeah, I doesn't really say anything about that though, but... God.
1704137	1707299	If I were to guess, I would say you probably use the Wiimote as a whip.
1707319	1708840	Alright.
1708920	1709180	Alright.
1710283	1713285	Anyhow, moving on to other Nintendo news.
1713405	1713985	Wii Fit.
1714025	1717446	We still don't have this game in the US, but it's come out in Japan.
1717506	1718587	It's come out in the UK.
1718887	1726271	See, now this is Nintendo playing a little game with us called Here's What the UK Feels Like all the time with this game.
1726411	1727071	Oh, darn.
1727291	1728512	I can't get Wii Fit.
1729192	1729832	So sad.
1729852	1733014	Oh, well, at least I had Brawl early and Mario Kart.
1733114	1734855	Are you sure you don't need Wii Fit?
1735195	1735735	I'm pretty sure.
1735755	1736435	Are you sure you should?
1736455	1737876	I already bought Wii Fit, okay?
1737996	1738736	So shut up.
1738796	1739557	I'm messing with you.
1740749	1741530	I have Wii Fit.
1741711	1742371	It's on order.
1742472	1743273	It's paid for.
1743293	1744154	I just wait.
1744695	1745556	Alright, we're here.
1746667	1747988	WeFit basically crushed one girl's dreams.
1748329	1748629	This is it.
1749290	1749570	Quote,
1770711	1771331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1795209	1802753	I know it's just a game, but seriously, we already have to worry about young girls starving themselves to look like magazine models, and now we have a game that tells them they're fat.
1805175	1808697	Is this going to be a problem when this game comes out over here?
1808977	1809457	Question.
1810077	1813319	Who actually uses the weight measurement of stone?
1813479	1814260	They do in Europe.
1814740	1815500	That's retarded.
1815660	1816681	She weighs 84 pounds.
1817421	1817701	Okay.
1817862	1818082	Yeah.
1819002	1821944	And she was so upset about being called fat, she ate the board.
1823663	1826033	49 and being 84 pounds, that's not really...
1826658	1829160	No, it is unfortunate.
1829240	1830361	And for being 10 years old?
1831021	1833223	You have to remember, though, it is just a game.
1833283	1839888	I mean, I kind of compare this to the fact that in brain training, like when you try to say blue, it doesn't pick it up.
1839928	1842450	You go, blue, blue, and it doesn't listen to you.
1842490	1844912	And you go, brew, and it listens to you.
1845192	1845733	You know what?
1845753	1850256	She's going to have to do a lot of starving herself in order to become a model nowadays.
1850536	1853659	It's a competitive market out there, and just refit is telling the truth.
1854099	1864571	Actually, they've actually been sort of showing a trend lately now where the super skinny, you know, rail thin model is no longer being considered attractive by a lot of companies.
1864811	1865272	That's all right.
1865392	1867855	I know when I get Wii Fit, it's not going to say I'm overweight.
1867875	1869156	It's going to say, get off!
1869817	1870778	Get off me!
1872420	1873841	Being thin causes cancer.
1873901	1874382	Haven't you heard?
1876069	1876950	Fat is the new thing.
1897638	1906768	The whole thing now is that there are actually studies out there saying that it's better to be, quote, overweight and active than be real thin and inactive.
1907669	1910872	GS68 says, love handles greater than exposed ribs.
1911994	1912714	Oh, hell yeah.
1912794	1914436	I mean, you gotta have something to grab onto, you know.
1915740	1923882	I don't want to, you know, I wouldn't want to date some guy that I had to, you know, if I grabbed a hold of him, I'd, like, poke a hole through my hand by his hip bone or something.
1923902	1924302	Or ow.
1925303	1925783	I know.
1927343	1931384	I think that... Sorry, skeletons aren't sexy.
1931404	1932565	Skeletons belong in a grave.
1933025	1934825	And I always mispronounce his name in chat.
1934845	1935366	I apologize.
1935606	1938587	Hippolytus says, Brain Training 2 has no blue.
1939047	1939567	Well, that's good.
1939587	1942968	That might make the sequel worth it alone, because I'll tell you, that blue thing was very frustrating.
1943528	1943668	But...
1944508	1945549	Thanks for watching!
1968557	1969898	Oh, fat!
1970278	1970638	Really?
1970658	1974060	Yeah, it took the game to tell you that.
1974540	1981884	So listeners and everybody that's going to be buying this game here in America, this is your chance to practice your attitude, okay?
1982144	1983925	Because, you know, you've got to have attitude.
1984245	1989628	So here's the thing, is that when the game tells you that you're fat, you go, I am, and that's more of me to love.
1990168	1991409	You just have to yell back at the game.
1992689	1995391	Now, the whole point is just, you know...
1997495	1998855	To just get out and do something.
1998895	2003236	That's the whole reason why I think that Wii Fit exists.
2004436	2009017	Just so that you're not sitting around playing a game, you're up and doing something, I think.
2009958	2021120	I think that it doesn't matter what a game that, first of all, does not see what you look like, does not know who you are, has no concept of what your life is like,
2022120	2026483	We need a sequel called We Fat that's specifically for fat and fabulous people.
2045510	2046490	That should be the sequel.
2046991	2051335	The point of the game is just to get up and do something.
2052096	2066030	Seriously, that's why the Wii has sold gazillions of consoles as it is, and Wii Sports is because Wii has that persona of, oh, it's a video game, but you get up and you do things.
2066110	2066631	I mean, come on.
2066671	2067031	You do?
2067051	2067411	I don't.
2068152	2069093	I don't when I'm playing it.
2087577	2095734	I've really actually, I've kind of been enjoying this trend from Nintendo lately where their games aren't just about fun, they're about fun plus improvement.
2096315	2097999	It's kind of like brain training.
2099478	2103121	or we've got our Wii games that get us up and moving.
2103602	2106344	Konami has had their similar games too.
2106804	2116493	I think it's more or less that there's been all this complaining about, oh, video games rot your mind and you sit on the couch and don't do anything and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2117133	2123899	But now they're doing something, exercising your intelligence, working your brain, working your body.
2123919	2124920	They're making it fun.
2125280	2126061	I don't think so.
2126081	2127081	I think this is the whole...
2128082	2130404	It's basically, they're following the money.
2130484	2137310	They're trying to figure out what gimmicky things they can do to get people that don't normally play games to play these things and buy them.
2137791	2142695	I mean, that's why they're focusing on the brain training stuff because people think, oh, it'll make me smarter.
2143896	2146138	I need to be smarter because smarter is good.
2146218	2150842	And then, you know, the whole Mario Kart and that stupid wheel attachment.
2151423	2152464	Oh, that's pretty neat.
2152504	2153385	Let me get that game.
2153405	2154686	It's like I'm driving a real car.
2155086	2156507	I thought that Wii Fit looked kind of fun
2178963	2179584	I'm going to buy it.
2179924	2182385	I got to say.
2182425	2186588	The whole reason that I would want to play it is just because it looks fun and I like doing active things.
2187808	2192131	I have to admit, that's kind of the reason why I'm going to get it, too, is that, yeah, it will kind of get me off the couch.
2192451	2194592	How long it will last, though, that's the question.
2195233	2197454	I still want to reenact DDR Night.
2198555	2199295	Comments in chat.
2199335	2201657	Hippolytus says, Brain Age tells you you're dumb.
2201717	2202937	Wii Fit tells you you're fat.
2203237	2205719	Gerardimo says, both of them together tell you you're fat and dumb.
2208089	2211091	Nintendo is about demoralization, apparently.
2212832	2215354	Queltipo says, can we have soul training, please?
2216075	2220558	They should have Wii morals or something like that.
2220918	2223000	Wheel of morality, turn, turn, turn.
2223040	2224781	Show us the lesson that we should learn.
2224801	2226883	Today's lesson is...
2227463	2229024	That's the game they need on Wii.
2229064	2232667	They need some type of moral lesson game.
2232767	2234549	And every kid in America should play it.
2234649	2237491	We already get other people's moral shoves down our throat every day.
2237511	2238732	We don't need our games doing it.
2239413	2247900	I forgot to mention, I think this week too, I know it wasn't on that launch list, but I'm pretty positive that it's one of the WiiWare launch titles.
2248280	2253124	Remember, there's also the Major League Eating game that comes out as well.
2253184	2253825	So, you know.
2255146	2255746	Thanks for watching!
2272416	2296689	that's great more of a cultural and that's all it needs to be here too I don't think they should shove morals down throat but they should you know have you know common sense type things you know like you know sense training don't call people ugly names good idea bad idea the game good idea bad idea the game good idea or we driver training trick or treating on Halloween bad idea trick or treating on St.
2296709	2301212	Patrick's Day yes that type of I don't know how you make a game out of that
2302944	2306346	Maybe like when you lose, Chainsaw Man comes and cuts your head off.
2306426	2306766	I don't know.
2307186	2307546	We'll see.
2307646	2309347	Like Resident Evil 4 mixed with Wii morals.
2309367	2309888	Wii ethics.
2309908	2310568	Alright, forget it.
2310668	2311168	Let's move on.
2311328	2313270	GS68 demands pee training.
2314210	2316371	Okay, now this topic has gone down the toilet.
2316391	2316992	Next story, please.
2317072	2320774	I don't want the game with the toilet that sings like on those training videos.
2321514	2327738	Anyway, going back to... I'm sorry.
2327758	2327838	What?
2328599	2336605	Gerardimo, good idea, feeding stray kittens in the park, bad idea, feeding stray kittens in the park to a bear.
2339867	2342049	Great, great concept, great concept.
2342349	2343470	Can I read the next one?
2343510	2344210	Yes, you can.
2344250	2345211	I'm sorry, I had to read that.
2345671	2351275	We has games for, we has games for virtual console in the UK.
2352236	2353457	So you want to know what they are?
2354884	2359087	Oh my god, in one of these, I so, so wish we would get it over here.
2361549	2362970	Okay, stop complaining, and what is it?
2362990	2363911	They get Puyo Puyo 2.
2364271	2364532	Nice.
2364932	2365753	Yay!
2367374	2370476	They also get Metal Slug for Neo Geo.
2372538	2376381	And... Now, I'm trying to...
2378533	2380354	Yeah, these are actually released on here.
2380394	2382135	This is one of the ones that's making me go, huh?
2382715	2383875	Break-In is on there.
2384676	2385676	And Cho Aineke.
2386957	2387297	Nice.
2388137	2396081	And for anyone who doesn't know what Cho Aineke is, it's the games with the mostly naked muscle men and speedos.
2396861	2398262	And it's a side-scrolling shooter.
2398862	2400803	And Jamie wants Cho Aineke very much.
2400883	2402644	It's the TurboGrafx version on top of that.
2402844	2403324	You never know.
2403604	2406445	Cho Aineke is, like, crack-tacular.
2406705	2407866	You should petition Nintendo.
2408373	2411294	You know we won't get over here because people have corn cobs shoved up their butts.
2412495	2412855	Not now.
2412915	2415396	You need to play some Wii Ethics.
2415516	2417357	And not even the good vibrating kind.
2419718	2422019	Because it'd be a little bit less uptight if it vibrated.
2422039	2423140	Okay, quick next story.
2427023	2430264	There's a couple... Quiltipo's readying his man beam.
2430744	2431824	He says, ready your man beam.
2432964	2433445	I'm sorry.
2433625	2437366	Well, there's this company that's Matrix Software.
2437406	2441307	You may not know them by their company name, but you know them from their games.
2441747	2449609	They have done the Final Fantasy 3 remake for the DS and are working on the Final Fantasy 4 remake for the DS.
2450649	2453930	Well, now they're working on their own game as well called Alundra.
2454910	2455110	Alundra!
2457509	2458510	I like Alundra.
2459410	2460791	It was a pretty fun RPG.
2460811	2462732	The art was done by Toriyama.
2477807	2481552	Uh, it says, uh, the latest project, I guess, is another original piece.
2482093	2484336	Uh, this time, uh, from, uh, Marvelous.
2485378	2490766	And it's called Avalon, uh, Code is the new game, I guess, because they did the launcher for the PlayStation.
2491667	2492288	And, um...
2493189	2501914	Avalon Code, it doesn't really say what it is, but of course it's going to be done in a similar style as the Final Fantasy remakes, kind of a 3D type of game.
2502475	2504756	They said with the art style similar to Crystal Chronicles.
2506117	2509939	Not a Lendera, they're not doing a new Lendera game, but Avalon Code is a new game.
2511200	2511820	It looks spiffy.
2512901	2514903	GameStop Insiders GameStop Insiders GameStop Insiders
2543076	2543336	What?
2544057	2547180	The color is metallic rose is supposed to be coming over here.
2547720	2550262	That is absolutely the first time I've ever heard of that.
2550562	2550842	Really?
2551803	2553184	Absolutely the first time.
2553264	2556947	I'm pretty sure that this has never been mentioned on the show before.
2557488	2557728	Right.
2558329	2558589	Never.
2561411	2563333	Also, over in Germany...
2564591	2575556	Some German retailers have also listed some other DS-like colors that are supposed to be coming out in Europe, and that is light blue, red, and green, and they all come with matching stylus colors.
2575956	2583800	And you know, with metallic rose being such a pink girly color, I wouldn't be surprised if they maybe, I don't know, got rid of pink or something.
2584220	2584461	Hmm.
2584721	2584921	Yeah.
2585561	2587483	So, like, they might be getting rid of pink altogether?
2587703	2588864	Yeah, maybe.
2588904	2590465	Because, you know, I mean, what's the point?
2590485	2592866	I mean, there's not that many girls out there that need a new system.
2592886	2596129	I mean, and Metallic Rose, that's just, that'll do just fine.
2596449	2596749	I agree.
2596869	2599451	Will there be a comparable boy color coming out, too, even?
2599671	2600552	I don't know about that.
2600572	2603094	I mean, because you've got black and white and all the other colors.
2603154	2604055	It takes a real man to enjoy pink.
2604175	2604375	I know.
2604415	2605235	I want Metallic Rose.
2605255	2606536	But it's Metallic Rose now.
2606636	2609799	Sans, you know, what was it?
2610699	2612801	Nintendogs, Paw, Silk Screening.
2613061	2613961	You know what color I want?
2614782	2616102	I want Death Metal Black.
2617063	2619444	Gerardimo wants Sparkle in our chatroom.
2619484	2620704	That'd be great.
2620745	2621165	Sparkles!
2621345	2622585	I want Death Metal Black.
2622605	2623646	They just need, like, Chrome.
2624566	2625747	No, I want, like, Red Black.
2625767	2626847	How about See-Through?
2626867	2627668	We have Red Black.
2628288	2629048	They do have Red Black.
2629629	2634451	Like, the dark, dark, dark, dark, dark red that looks like you're looking to Obsidian?
2634771	2636952	Get a Red Black DS and set it far away.
2637526	2643210	You know, I could get a dark, a black DS and then use like transparent red paint on it and customize it myself.
2643290	2643671	You could.
2644151	2645412	I want to customize my DS.
2645552	2649595	You know, if you go to the Nintendo store, they sell those custom DSs you can get in all those different colors.
2649615	2651457	For like $4 billion.
2651557	2654779	I came so close to buying one because I am a consumer whore.
2655660	2656100	And how?
2657041	2658842	Maybe that's what I'll spend my stimulus check on.
2658882	2661004	I'll fly to New York and buy one of those DSs.
2661444	2662765	I'm just going to customize my own.
2662805	2663706	I'll make my own skins.
2665067	2666208	I'm not really going to do that, by the way.
2666713	2667454	I don't know, Rob.
2667514	2668395	I think you would.
2685616	2697528	Dream Pinball for PC and Wii, Iron Man on PC, Perry Rodon on PC, Silent Hill Origins on PS2, Supreme Ruler 2020, which is a game about me.
2705962	2707605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2719148	2719688	It looked cool.
2720149	2721710	It looked cool.
2721870	2725812	In the U.S., there's not a whole lot coming out this week.
2726652	2730955	I guess it would be an exciting week if you liked, I don't know, Chronicle of Narnia, Prince Caspian.
2731255	2733036	Because there's a few games coming out for that.
2733736	2735637	Well, that wouldn't have to do with the movie coming out this weekend, right?
2735657	2738078	Well, maybe, yeah, yeah.
2738098	2740060	360 DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3.
2740620	2742961	I believe the Wii version is coming out next week for some reason.
2742981	2744122	Yeah.
2745191	2746852	Castel of Shikigami 3, Ikaruga, DECA Sports,
2768003	2771325	Wii Ski, also another $30 game.
2771765	2779448	That's supposed to be a pretty fun little skiing game, also supporting the Wii balance boards, so you can lean on that.
2779488	2780089	That's kind of cool.
2781029	2788392	Drone Tactics for the DS, kind of a weird mechanical insect tactical game from Atlus.
2789093	2793975	And then we've got Myst for the DS, which, you know, it's just Myst.
2795115	2796256	You know, it's just Myst.
2796716	2797376	It's just missed, yeah.
2799417	2803739	And I believe that's pretty much it, I think, for this week.
2804340	2806961	Remember that hilarious theme song the DECA Sports game had?
2808221	2808942	Oh, my God.
2809282	2810142	We need to get that.
2810202	2810943	That's funny.
2810983	2812863	That's in our Justin.TV archive, by the way.
2812903	2816065	If you go to Justin.TV and you dip back in the archive, you can find that.
2816085	2819747	That was the best part about that game was the really weird theme song that they had.
2819767	2820807	I thought the game was kind of fun.
2820827	2821968	It was like Wii Sports...
2823451	2825854	It's almost like a Wii Sports 2 in a way.
2826094	2826474	Almost.
2826915	2828557	It's like a fun little party game.
2829338	2830619	It doesn't have that Nintendo touch.
2830659	2833661	I can't explain it.
2833681	2840207	Nintendo just doesn't have the really cool cheesy theme songs.
2841107	2844850	Let's move over to Japan and look at what kind of releases are coming out over in Japan.
2845731	2850194	Not a ton of stuff this week but better than last week where nothing came out.
2850555	2853897	The Darkness makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week.
2854758	2856299	That's really the only big release on the Xbox 360.
2856339	2857380	PlayStation 3
2858741	2863425	Not a lot for you this week, although there's a couple things next week, but I'll tell you about those next week.
2864807	2869931	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Totsugeki Famicom Wars Versus.
2870432	2872073	You might know that as Battalion Wars 2.
2872233	2875456	That is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
2875476	2877999	That's not a price reduction, because I thought they had that way before us.
2879200	2879360	Um...
2880376	2885580	No, if you want to import it, it's going to cost you $65, so I don't think that's a price reduction.
2886420	2887681	I thought they had that a long time ago.
2887701	2888221	You know, it's weird.
2888241	2891344	Japan has been getting some releases kind of delayed.
2891464	2893225	Maybe they're re-releasing them or something.
2893625	2893985	Perhaps.
2895726	2900570	On the PlayStation 2, Aoshiro is coming out.
2902069	2904955	And that also is getting a limited edition version coming out.
2906438	2907400	Let's see what this game looks like.
2907420	2908722	It looks like some type of RPG.
2909023	2910846	I'm thinking, I don't know, it has little cut scenes.
2912089	2913051	Is it based on anime?
2915778	2918859	There's no actual game screens I can find, just cutscenes.
2918919	2920299	I'm going to guess that it's a dating sim.
2920339	2921420	Maybe it's a dating sim.
2921460	2922400	When in doubt, dating sim.
2922440	2924220	No, it's some type of adventure game.
2924240	2925461	That's the category it falls into.
2925881	2926201	Okay.
2927241	2927601	Let's see.
2927701	2932283	Also coming out, Slaughter Up Core 10 Mach Go Go Go 2.
2933403	2938064	And that's Slaughter, S-L-O-T-T-E-R, not like murder with a pickaxe.
2939165	2940445	That is Speed Racer.
2941775	2942316	It looks like.
2942997	2944899	Because it has the guy from Speed Racer on the cover.
2945440	2946601	Yeah, the classic Speed Racer.
2947943	2949345	So some type of game...
2951537	2953038	Rocketman, It Came From Uranus
2979456	2985463	That's on 360 or Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network this week.
2986424	2988606	So mature we are here at Orange Launch Radio.
2990828	2993471	If you have rockets coming out your anus, you might have a problem.
2994252	2995914	Rocketman, it came from your anus.
2997861	3005847	coming out on the Nintendo DS, Dungeon of Windaria, Luminous Ark 2, and Mahjong Navi DS.
3006388	3008970	Yet another Mahjong title because you just can't have enough Mahjong.
3009790	3011732	Let's see if there's anything on the PSP.
3012292	3018477	Yeah, Bleach, Heat the Soul 5 comes out for the Sony PSP.
3019458	3020178	So check that out.
3020238	3023821	Those are your Japanese release dates for this week, May 15th.
3025242	3026063	And good for them.
3027520	3028041	Good for them.
3028983	3033834	Well, here's some very interesting yet fun news for us.
3035076	3037622	Burnout Paradise is going to have a PC release.
3039191	3041373	and Criterion said, okay, here.
3042454	3048120	So they're going to be actually rebuilding it so that it works pretty well on PC.
3048160	3049862	They're enhancing multiplayer.
3050622	3063355	They're doing community content, online features and resolution is at 1920 by 2400 and is pretty much straight from the original.
3063939	3066760	I'm kind of curious what community features is going to entail.
3067180	3067541	Sex.
3068481	3069641	I somehow doubt that.
3069661	3070202	Group sex.
3073063	3075424	Did somebody break DarkSakura this week?
3076064	3076604	What is up?
3076684	3077205	I guess.
3077825	3078105	All right.
3078465	3080746	Well, that should be interesting.
3082367	3084608	See, the sick thing is now I'm actually picturing that.
3084648	3087109	Like, how would that work in Burnout Paradise?
3087269	3087649	I don't know.
3088089	3090290	Brings a whole new meaning to take me down to Paradise City.
3091230	3091330	So...
3093379	3094079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3112349	3119412	Well, just remember that all the games for Windows stuff nowadays supports the Xbox 360 controller and, of course, the racing wheels.
3119452	3120132	Wait, wait, wait.
3120312	3122753	If you have an Xbox 360 controller, why don't you have a 360?
3122793	3131637	Because you're like pro PC gaming, but you're like, I'm not that into PC gaming where I need to use a controller.
3131837	3133698	Is the audience for that that big?
3134378	3136619	I played Crysis with a 360 controller.
3136639	3137519	That's just me.
3137680	3138260	All right.
3139379	3141501	I'm not that into PC gaming.
3142022	3147427	Well, hooray for PC gamers because Burnout Paradise is a solid game and I'm sure they'll be enjoying that.
3148828	3151210	Another game coming to PCs everywhere.
3152071	3157276	Everyday Shooter is coming to Steam and that was a pretty awesome game on the PlayStation Network.
3157436	3162461	I would know though because I hate having to put my credit card information on the PlayStation Network.
3163505	3164366	I think it's available now.
3185427	3187649	Orange Lounge Radio giving you definitive gaming news every week.
3187669	3189390	Ah, we think it's out there.
3189410	3190631	No, it's out there now.
3190651	3190871	All right.
3191372	3197096	I'm like, I could log on just... If I didn't think it would disrupt the all-game stream, I would log into Steam right now just to check.
3197436	3199918	You know, I have to get that audio surf game too on Steam.
3199938	3201039	I keep hearing good things about that.
3201079	3202520	The only thing I bought on Steam is Portal.
3202861	3203501	Not that anybody cares.
3208203	3208943	Movie news.
3209343	3211044	More video games becoming movies.
3211785	3215487	One game that has been opted apparently for a movie.
3215987	3226534	I guess what's going on is that Naughty Dog has made the game Uncharted Drake's Fortune and it's been optioned by Atlas Entertainment.
3228260	3255497	so that means that it is possible that in the next few years Uncharted Drake's Fortune could actually become a movie now when I think about video games that I want to become movies this isn't really one that pops right into my head but okay I think it could work though because it's not that much of a stretch it's just you know action adventure thing so Uncharted the movie may be coming to a theater near you in about two years we'll see we'll see
3256553	3260075	Well, there's other movies in talk.
3260215	3262496	Actually, it says that it's already in development.
3263016	3271960	It's a Bioshock movie to be put out by Universal with Gore Verbinski as the director, it seems.
3273301	3277182	So, hey, that's kind of cool.
3277563	3278843	He did Pirates of the Caribbean.
3280004	3284806	And it also looks like they've got John Logan as the screenplay writer.
3285689	3310708	well they've made a lot a lot more with a lot less so you know the thing about Bioshock though is that when I play Bioshock it's kind of like watching a movie you know what I mean like I don't know like we're getting to this point where games are so realistic they don't have to be made into movies because they already kind of feel like movies does that make sense nope sorry not hearing you but uh doesn't mean that they won't make a movie out of it all right fine
3311277	3315441	Well, it's just, you know, if there's money to be made, then they're going to make the money.
3315561	3316322	Yeah, right.
3316602	3317082	I hear you.
3317143	3317623	But I don't know.
3317643	3321527	There's just, there's other games that I would want to see made into movies first.
3321647	3323208	Like some of the other Final Fantasy games.
3323388	3323709	I don't know.
3324509	3325731	But maybe that's just the fanboy.
3325751	3328093	We only had, you know, one good Final Fantasy movie.
3328633	3329594	And that was Advent Children.
3330295	3330555	Yep.
3331416	3331756	Yeah.
3332277	3332557	Oh, well.
3333500	3334941	Grand Theft Auto 4 Grand Theft Auto 4
3347729	3351272	and 3.6 million of those the first day.
3351913	3353094	So that's pretty awesome.
3354114	3360520	And I'm sure, well, they're expecting, I think, to do another, you know, a total of a billion dollars by the end of this year.
3361440	3362922	Which is even bigger than a movie.
3363422	3363622	Yeah.
3363802	3366324	You know, the only movie that made that much money in the U.S.
3366344	3368126	Is that an international figure or just a U.S.
3368166	3368326	figure?
3368346	3369227	I think it's international.
3369507	3369767	Okay.
3369807	3376593	Well, still, I mean, Titanic is like one of a few, only very, very few movies has made a billion internationally.
3376633	3377033	You know what I mean?
3377413	3388603	Most of that is in, I want to say in the US, because the UK, I read, only sold like about 900, just under a million units.
3389284	3389624	Only?
3390224	3391425	There's a lot of games that would love to sell that.
3391445	3394048	Well, I mean, just under a million when, you know, about...
3395611	3398973	5 million is coming from the US, I'd say that's the majority of the sales there.
3399253	3399733	Alright, fine.
3399813	3403355	But still, yeah, it's going to do very well.
3403835	3406756	I mean, it's been, what, parodied on a bunch of different things now.
3407056	3411938	It's on Saturday Night Live and Conan, so... Although it was kind of lame on Saturday Night Live.
3411978	3413279	I don't know, it was a little stupid.
3413319	3415280	But yeah, I mean, it's definitely hitting the mainstream.
3415780	3415900	So...
3416958	3421941	I gotta back up in stories and talk about the Bioshock movie because there's some comments from chat.
3421981	3426523	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Actdeft wants to know, will the main character save the Little Sisters or not?
3427604	3430705	Quiltipo wants to know, will Johnny Depp star as a spinny splicer?
3431806	3437629	Ranma says, just because the fan base is massive, that does not mean the fans will buy it.
3438089	3440331	Possibly talking about buying into a Bioshock movie.
3440451	3440891	I'd see it.
3442116	3444337	I'd actually see it, too, just kind of out of curiosity.
3444657	3453021	I would be kind of curious how they'd approach that, too, though, because, you know, there's the whole little sister thing, and you can do very good things or very bad things, depending on your moral compass.
3453701	3455662	I need Wii Ethics to help me make the decision here.
3456722	3457943	Here, hold on a second.
3458903	3462004	Okay, it says I should kill you.
3462945	3464585	Wii Ethics says I should kill you, sorry.
3464645	3467427	Yeah, it's not your day, Magic 8-Ball.
3467567	3468267	Okay.
3469562	3471423	Wheel of Morality, Turn, Turn, Turn.
3471483	3473024	Show me which person I should burn.
3474145	3475506	That's the best ever.
3476026	3477848	Outcome not favorable.
3478288	3479309	Oh, yeah.
3479329	3479669	Sorry.
3479849	3480129	Fire.
3481090	3481430	All right.
3482231	3485693	APB is a game that is coming out from Realtime Worlds.
3486233	3490216	And Realtime Worlds, they just bought the distribution rights to the game.
3490256	3491577	It's a big MMO coming out.
3492037	3494739	And basically, they're making no shame about this.
3494779	3499342	They are saying they want to try and get this to Rockstar as Grand Theft Auto Online.
3499782	3507711	Yeah, originally, Realtime Worlds, they actually developed the game and they had sold the rights to... I don't remember who the hell they sold it to.
3507731	3508692	Well, they sold it to somebody.
3508732	3509233	But they bought it back.
3509253	3509833	And they bought it back.
3509894	3515860	Because, you know, APB... Well, Realtime Worlds did Crackdown, you know, awesome sandbox game.
3515880	3517162	And this one's kind of like...
3518794	3529784	It's a sandbox online game, basically, where you have half the people are cops, half of them are crooks, and all sorts of chaos is going on.
3530024	3532026	So it's like a cross between... Cops and robbers.
3532086	3535189	Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto, online, so it's not bad.
3536070	3537311	So yeah, it'd be pretty easy.
3537351	3539453	As long as there are guns and rocket launchers, I'm sold.
3540218	3540819	It looks pretty awesome.
3540839	3543100	That's the one they had during the tech demo.
3543120	3547303	It was during Game Developers Conference.
3547343	3549664	They had the custom characters, and one of them was Shiggy.
3552106	3552606	Oh, yes.
3552626	3556009	It was with the mushroom boxers.
3556069	3556289	Yes.
3557029	3558590	Very awesome character creator.
3558850	3561232	Now, we should say, though, right now, this is in rumor status.
3561292	3562573	It's not confirmed.
3562613	3564334	If it comes out as APP, I'll still play it.
3564394	3564914	It's awesome.
3565835	3566115	All right.
3566956	3567536	Fanboy much?
3567556	3567736	Yes.
3568237	3568477	Yes.
3570314	3571875	I like my sandbox games.
3571915	3572415	What can I say?
3573876	3575037	Well, they like you too.
3577298	3577658	Alright.
3578379	3580240	Well, let's move on with our next story.
3581300	3583642	Well, what's the best part about Mortal Kombat, Rob?
3585103	3585563	Katana.
3587324	3590105	What does everybody else think the best thing about Mortal Kombat is, Rob?
3590746	3591306	Friendships.
3592187	3592987	Fatalities!
3593247	3594128	Oh yes, fatalities.
3595343	3606610	So, of course, as we know, Midway said that Mortal Kombat vs. DC was going to be a T-rated fighting game with, you know, no fatalities.
3606670	3616816	But what it is, is they're not going to be as outrageous as they were, but they are modifying the fatalities.
3616856	3618877	They are going to still be finishing moves in there.
3619988	3624111	Remember the last time they modified Fatalities for the Super Nintendo release?
3624592	3625212	Sweat, yo.
3625272	3625532	Yeah.
3626573	3627334	That's all I gotta say.
3628675	3636661	And honestly, though, I'm going to reserve judgment, but I only want that game to play as Batman, so whatever.
3637321	3637762	Amen.
3638442	3646148	Because it's all about that one quote where he says, I'm the goddamn Batman in the comics.
3646471	3649613	It is sacrilegious, though, to perform a fatality on Batman.
3649633	3650594	That's what I still don't get.
3650954	3652095	He can perform fatalities.
3652115	3655437	He can perform fatalities all he wants, although Batman, I don't think, really kills people.
3655798	3656598	I think he does now.
3656678	3657479	Well, yeah.
3657579	3661001	I mean, in the movies, usually when people die, it's their own fault.
3661221	3662763	Batman didn't try to kill them.
3662823	3663623	They just died.
3663643	3664564	You know what I mean?
3664944	3667706	Depends on who's actually Batman at any given time in the comics.
3667766	3674091	But see, the Batman god in my world is Adam West from the 60s Batman, and he never killed no one.
3674692	3676473	So really, Batman shouldn't be doing fatalities.
3676493	3678535	That didn't kill him, it was gravity that killed him.
3678935	3681257	Gravity and a sudden stopping.
3681297	3685780	It was an accident, he fell down an elevator shaft onto some bullets.
3686561	3687262	There you go.
3688883	3689143	Yes.
3690084	3690204	Um...
3691832	3699796	Anyways, games like Mortal Kombat have been claimed before to turn children into bloodthirsty killers.
3700316	3702597	But Harvard says otherwise.
3702617	3706098	Because, you know, Harvard, everybody there is super smart, right?
3706338	3707659	So we've got to listen to what they say.
3707739	3708179	Or rich.
3708799	3709160	Or rich.
3709600	3711681	Hey, well, that's even more reason to listen to them.
3712461	3717223	A pair of Harvard researchers say violent video games don't turn children into killers.
3717943	3718704	Their parents do.
3719224	3731832	According to a newly published book, Grand Theft Childhood, The Surprising Truth, about video games and what parents do, psychologists Lawrence Kuttner and Cheryl Olson dispel, of course, common myths about video games.
3732492	3742138	And apparently they found during their two-year study that there was no data to support any connection between games and real-life violence.
3742198	3743879	This is not the first time I've heard of this book.
3743999	3744720	It sounds pretty good.
3746106	3755273	They studied 1,200 middle school children in a $1.5 million federally funded study.
3755353	3765641	Instead of studying children in the laboratory like other studies, they actually sat down and talked to kids after long bouts of game playing, sometimes in excess of 15 hours a week.
3766662	3771005	Lucky kids, I guess, were playing a variety of games from non-violent The Sims games.
3772136	3772497	I don't know.
3772577	3773760	Depends how you play The Sims.
3773960	3776686	My Sims sessions are pretty violent.
3776706	3777628	Was it...
3781730	3809406	Grand Theft Auto and they discovered children who played violent video games those rated mature or above were just relieving stress some children did exhibit playful fighting after playing games but this was similar to what children have done always after watching action or karate type movies 51% of the male children who played for 15 hours or more violent video games per week were involved in fights
3811067	3819952	in the past year compared to 28% who played regular video games.
3820732	3821733	Doesn't make much sense.
3821913	3824274	I guess who did not play video games.
3824815	3825095	Anyways.
3826356	3826896	Articles.
3827796	3828537	Got the wrong text there.
3829417	3837222	For girls, 40% of the violent game players were in fights compared to, I guess, 14% of the non-violent players.
3838743	3850274	So despite these figures, I guess Kuttner and Olsen say that this is just a correlation and that fighting was probably due to an underlying psychological problem that children had before playing video games.
3851695	3862425	I like how they just kind of just, they're all, you know, even though the data suggests that, you know, they may be prone to more violence, it's just, we'll just ignore that.
3862987	3863830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3868815	3869755	I think it's already out.
3870155	3870455	No, I know.
3870475	3873596	I think it just came out, or it was about to come out.
3873696	3878717	I think I checked it out on Amazon.com about a month ago, and it was coming out at the end of the month.
3879497	3880057	I'm curious about it.
3880637	3882578	It's available now.
3883158	3883698	Well, there you have it.
3884718	3885958	Is it being widely distributed?
3885978	3887679	Do you think I can walk into any Barnes & Noble and get it?
3888219	3888599	Probably.
3888659	3891439	It says right now on Amazon.com you can get it for $16.50.
3891479	3891739	All right.
3896876	3898718	We are going to have a live cage match
3924362	3924822	The Cage Match
3949175	3957862	Tonight, the cage match is involving the Grand Theft Auto IV contest entries that Orange Lounge Radio received this week.
3958382	3970012	We have whittled it down to four finalists tonight, and tonight, live on the show, our chatters will be picking their favorite in the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest entries.
3970552	3971833	Thanks for watching!
3987927	3988587	It's going to be great.
3988807	3991688	So the way the cage match works, if you want to vote, you have to be in our chat room.
3991728	3997730	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And then you can place your vote via private message only.
3997770	3998890	I'll explain more about that.
3999150	4003332	You cannot vote until all four songs have been played.
4003392	4010794	And if you are in chat tonight, and you are the author of one of these songs, we'll go ahead and let you vote for your own song because you're actually listening live tonight.
4010834	4012294	So you get a bonus point, I guess.
4012314	4013995	Alright, you ready to get to the four finalists?
4015545	4018027	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4038706	4044711	They have to make, or I mean, in Grand Theft Auto 4, they have the radio station that plays when you're driving around town.
4045051	4055018	Well, our entrance had to make a bumper that could possibly be heard on the radio in Grand Theft Auto 4, but it had to incorporate Orange Lounge Radio somehow.
4055318	4060682	Like either one of our in-jokes, or one of our, it just had to have something to do with Orange Lounge Radio.
4061183	4062504	Alright, so here it is.
4063817	4065277	The four you can vote for tonight.
4065317	4066598	Here's finalist number one.
4066678	4069418	Finalist number one is Actdeft.
4069558	4071959	And his submission is a little loud, but here it is.
4071999	4074999	Here's Actdeft's entry into the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.
4075039	4075439	Enjoy.
4076100	4078900	Are you tired and stressed of all your day's work?
4079600	4083961	Pull back your anger and listen to O.L.R.
4084321	4086022	Where you listen to hits like...
4087700	4090522	I don't like you, can't you see Now get the fuck away from me
4131420	4146073	So reject your false American idols and listen to Armour Shrouds Radio, Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, only on AllDreams.com Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.
4151318	4154881	Alright, that was entry number one coming to us from Actdeft.
4154901	4156402	Let's go around and give our thoughts on that.
4156442	4157023	DarkSakura.
4159176	4163037	A little derivative, I think, so it gets a seven.
4163497	4163837	All right.
4164958	4175361	Look, I would have given that a very high score, but look, you made way too much fun of me, and those are clips that are like five years old, and I am so pissed off that they've resurfaced.
4175701	4177921	Not really, but whatever.
4179142	4180282	They were taken out of context.
4181562	4182683	I'll also give it a seven.
4182963	4183183	Loki.
4184046	4185247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4207064	4208265	She's not on crack.
4209086	4209886	She's totally on crack.
4223686	4228269	Hello, I'm Smith Weston, and I'm here to talk about a growing threat to America.
4228689	4231331	Iraqi suicide babies.
4231851	4238155	They may look small and cute, but don't let a situation like this happen to America.
4242137	4244278	Oh my, what a cute baby.
4244298	4245559	Wait a second, baby.
4245939	4247540	Why do you have C4 chopped to your waist?
4248341	4249041	Nooooo!
4256952	4260314	My opponent won't protect you from Iraqi suicide babies.
4260794	4264095	In fact, he refuses to believe they exist.
4264816	4266816	So vote Smith-Weston for mayor.
4267157	4268037	The right choice.
4268957	4270098	For America.
4276601	4278662	God, the audio levels on these are all so different.
4278702	4279202	Sorry, guys.
4279582	4280883	Alright, that was entry number two.
4281103	4284284	Ian M. with the Iraqi suicide babies ad.
4284304	4284945	What did you guys think?
4284965	4285465	DarkSakura.
4286070	4289113	It would have been funny if he hadn't been spitting into the microphone.
4291175	4299082	The idea was funny, but the execution of said idea... But they're not professionals.
4299122	4300403	We have to go a little easy on them.
4300463	4309631	But that's why you go back and listen to it, and when you realize you're going, you're speaking into the microphone, then you go back and move the microphone away from your mouth.
4310391	4311412	So it gets a 7.
4312443	4312723	All right.
4313063	4319885	Yeah, it was a little popping piece for me that, you know, and this is a problem we even have on the show sometimes because we don't have sufficient mic guards.
4320305	4322166	And it really depends on the mic you use.
4322206	4324826	So I'm being a little more lenient because you might just have a junky mic.
4325206	4326567	The idea was good, though.
4326807	4330548	I actually would have added like some music or something to make it a little more upbeat.
4330868	4332008	But maybe you didn't know how.
4332168	4333369	So I can't punish you for that.
4333389	4336489	But I think I think it's going to be tough against these other finalists.
4336509	4337910	But I'll also give you a seven, Loki.
4339215	4356063	uh could have been better if you had a lot more like internet clips of like babies cooing or like and like explosions more explosions more baby sounds and i think that would have been like pretty awesome but i'll give you like a seven because it was you know definitely more original and plain clips
4356463	4359747	Alright, here comes finalist number three tonight.
4359807	4363791	Finalist number three in the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest is Able2Think.
4364272	4364972	Here's his entry.
4365012	4366174	It's a short one, 30 seconds.
4366314	4369117	Able2Think, next finalist in the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest.
4370914	4374435	Hey ya, y'all are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4374875	4382957	I've got four strippers giving me lap dance right now and that doesn't even come close to the sublime audio quality of the OLR crew.
4383638	4388879	If y'all are listening live, it's like a three hour orgasm for your ears, you know what I'm saying?
4389599	4391540	I mean, OLR is the shit.
4392180	4396721	Now, y'all keep listening while these girls come back to my place for a little action.
4397121	4398622	Come on girls, let's go.
4404793	4410222	Alright, that was entry number three in the Grand Theft Auto IV contest tonight.
4411123	4413587	That was Able to Think, DarkSakura.
4414281	4421164	That made me snicker, but it didn't have enough going on, so it gets a 6.
4422444	4427086	I think there was actually a Grand Theft Auto 4 reference in that one, which is pretty good.
4427166	4429847	And it's very pimp, like Grand Theft Auto is.
4430888	4433029	So I give that a 7 as well.
4433309	4435049	But again, same thing I told the last guy.
4435089	4438071	Could I use some music to make it a little more upbeat?
4439474	4442437	Yeah, same as the last one.
4442457	4444438	Actually, I'm going to give this one a six.
4445139	4445940	I like the voice.
4445980	4453386	The voice was funny, but it was just needed a little bit more.
4453486	4464937	We're playing for a freaking limited edition 360 here, which should be going to me, I would have you know, because I am the greatest Grand Theft Auto fan out there, but whatever.
4465657	4465997	All right.
4466792	4468594	Here we go, the last entry tonight.
4468754	4471656	Entry number four in tonight's contest.
4472057	4476781	The finalist is, drumroll, SSJ100Matt.
4476841	4480184	Here is his entry into the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.
4480304	4481465	SSJ100Matt, take it away.
4482425	4493035	From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs Furries, and Orange Lounge Revolution comes... Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix!
4493922	4504691	That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-pissing, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.
4505031	4513218	You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts.
4514098	4517901	When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer.
4518161	4519963	I'm down on my knees.
4520579	4521899	I'm staying in.
4522940	4527161	I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.
4527341	4528181	DarkSakura?
4529441	4539204	Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a boat fire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.
4539464	4539744	Sorry.
4539824	4543025	You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.
4543365	4546646	Don't get strung out by the way I look.
4547791	4550394	Don't judge a book by its cover.
4550414	4551756	John DMN Bresler.
4552077	4553178	You ever go to Duck Island?
4554259	4555541	Your mom goes to Duck Island.
4557083	4562750	And a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't want you to hear.
4563069	4568311	Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.
4568431	4571752	So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution's second mix.
4571852	4576594	When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.
4576714	4583097	It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.
4583317	4585900	But I poop from there.
4586561	4588404	And it's only from the Nintendo Wii.
4588724	4596474	So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a WorldCorp breach, bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
4596755	4598777	If you do, Loki might dress up as Tim.
4598977	4600059	Not a guarantee.
4603752	4609296	There is entry number four in the contest tonight, SSJ100Matt with OLR Revolution second mix.
4609696	4610056	Jamie.
4610116	4610957	Fucking ten.
4611037	4611857	That was brilliant.
4612558	4614439	That's what we were talking about.
4614779	4624185	We had clever music, clever ideas, good clips too, not just, you know, the same old ones that we hear all the time.
4624646	4627588	And it wasn't even you singing Sky's Voice the game.
4628608	4629629	You were doing something else.
4629969	4631049	DarkSakura.com
4653016	4653577	Thanks for watching!
4670563	4674306	I don't know where in the hell you found that clip of me singing like a prayer.
4674926	4677528	I recorded that in a karaoke room at Great America.
4677548	4678228	You played it on a show before.
4678588	4679309	Not this show.
4680009	4682951	No, it was on Travis' show years ago.
4683332	4690757	I don't know where the F you unearthed that clip, but I'm taking points off for you doing that and subjecting all of our listeners to that.
4691337	4691857	So I give you a 9.
4692618	4699883	Loki, I would have given you a 9 or 10, but I'm afraid that you are, I don't know,
4701103	4713246	Confusing the listeners, because I'm afraid that Orange Lounge Revolution 2 does not count towards the I Have Judgment numbers, and that would be a flat-out lie.
4714627	4715947	So you can guess that.
4716607	4716967	All right.
4718287	4721448	All right, let's recap the four that you can vote for tonight.
4721568	4723929	Entry number one was Actdeft.
4723949	4724089	Actdeft.
4729632	4731153	Great, and it was Clips and me singing.
4732313	4735575	Entry number two was Ian M with his OLR ad.
4736215	4739817	Entry number three, I'm so used to when it's actually full of songs.
4739857	4743359	Entry number three is Able to Think.
4749542	4751644	And entry number four you can vote for tonight is SSJ100 Matt.
4752324	4752845	I'm down on my knees.
4752865	4753325	I'm staying in.
4767523	4768844	Yeah, we'll use a clip of Loki that time.
4768864	4769224	There you go.
4769544	4772266	Alright, those are just random clips and four entries.
4772346	4774447	Alright, place vote now.
4774547	4778569	Send a private message to Sky in chat with your vote.
4778649	4780890	If you're listening on the podcast, so sorry.
4780930	4783652	You're not able to participate in the voting process.
4783692	4785893	We'll come up with something for you guys later.
4786453	4787274	Place vote now.
4787394	4788394	Send your private message in.
4788434	4790696	We will announce the winner at the top of part B.
4791576	4798539	But for now, we have one more thing we gotta get to before we can end Part A tonight, and that is getting to our classic game of the week.
4798559	4804522	We gotta pay respect to our elders a little bit, because without our elders in gaming, there would be no Grand Theft Auto 4.
4805102	4809244	So, DarkSakura, take it away and tell us your classic video game of the week.
4811246	4820817	My classic game of the week is one that I have brought up a number of times on the show, which is one of the greatest shooting games ever.
4822379	4823741	It's Radiant Silvergun.
4825082	4825663	Woo!
4825743	4826464	Radiant Silvergun!
4828203	4831146	Radiant Silvergun is developed by Treasure.
4831566	4839034	I have played this in the arcade, and I'm still trying to freaking find the Saturn copy, because, I mean, it's fucking Radiant Silvergun, hello.
4839934	4852547	And the good thing about this game, this is one of the things that I always, always liked, is that you had, um, your weapons were all available at the same time, um, your different power-ups, um,
4854062	4856905	You could do a regular forward gun called the Vulcan.
4856945	4862470	You had homing missiles and you had a spread burst effect.
4862630	4864392	Then you had like a lock-on spread.
4864472	4869256	You had one that would shoot one beam in the front and then a ton of beams in the back.
4869797	4873841	You had a plasma weapon that sort of reminds me a little bit more
4875041	4881585	of the weapon, the electricity weapon from Raiden DX, remember?
4882286	4889430	Except it was very thin and it would be blocked by whatever, like different items that were in the way.
4889450	4896634	And then you had something called the Radiant Sword, which was a sword that could shoot out from either side.
4897735	4899476	There was also a few...
4901773	4905554	See, you didn't actually have your power to level up your current weapons.
4906455	4915678	One of my favorite ones in here is these two balls that come out right in front of you, but you shoot them out and they hover and then destroy whatever is in their way.
4916478	4925261	And I also like this sword that comes out from behind and then comes out in a wide arc and claps together right in front.
4925281	4926442	I think that's a very cool thing.
4927602	4929063	It was very bullet heavy.
4931298	4947352	and like the one level that Rob's playing on the feed right now is the whole level where you're fighting just this big ship that it rotates around you and moves and you have to move with it and it was a very very challenging game
4951425	4962234	The Saturn version had a few different things as in it would have you play through all of the stages to unlock everything.
4965365	4969408	It was like you were having to play it in chronological order, too.
4969428	4972590	It was very bizarre, because you start off at 3, then 2, then 4, 6, and then 1.
4972630	4977493	So there's all kinds of weirdness with it, but it's Treasure, so we expect weirdness from them.
4979835	4989181	But you've also got four different characters to choose from, and each of them has their own little quirks and everything.
4989221	4991162	You've got the cute girl and everything.
4991283	4991403	So...
4993884	5005754	The arcade mode would be played basically without the cutscenes or the dialogue, but there was a Saturn mode that did have a bit more story involved and had dialogue and stuff.
5005954	5018925	Like, there's one whole stage that you play, and this has got dialogue running all through the first part of the stage, and it's that, you know, sort of old man voice saying, we did this back in the day, and somebody shot somebody, and there was a big war, and a lot of people died.
5019305	5019425	So...
5020966	5021867	That's Radiosilver.
5022688	5023789	It's freaking awesome.
5023949	5026672	It's treasure.
5027052	5030576	It's like a shooter, but with uniqueness.
5030876	5032217	I don't know how else to explain it.
5032237	5032778	It's treasure.
5033579	5037522	The only thing you can say about a treasure game is that it's freaking treasure.
5038815	5049041	All of their games, where they may seem like a straightforward genre that you've seen 50 million times, they take something in it and innovate it.
5049421	5054643	They do something that turns it around and makes it completely different.
5055144	5061567	And, of course, they did Ikaruga, which, contrary to popular belief, is not a true sequel to Radiant Silvergun.
5061607	5063988	It's more of a spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun.
5065229	5085571	but I still honestly I think a Radiant Silvergun is superior to Ikaruga but that's me and if Treasure knows what's good for them we will be getting we will be getting more I guess re-releases of Radiant Silvergun and they'll give them directly to me and only you
5086835	5109873	and GS68 points out something that I was going to mention is that Radiant Silvergun was inspired by Image Fight which was by IRM and that's the team that gave us, well the company that gave us R-Type and also completely unrelated to Radiant Silvergun but since I mentioned R-Type I have to say this is that if you order that R-Type strategy game you get an R-Type
5110458	5111819	We covered that last week, but that's alright.
5111979	5112439	I have one.
5112900	5113360	Oh, very cool.
5113380	5113780	You like it?
5113920	5114101	Yes, I do.
5114121	5114641	How big is it?
5115281	5116722	It's, uh... We couldn't figure that out on last week's show.
5116742	5117783	It's about three inches long.
5117943	5118183	Huh.
5118424	5119524	It's fairly decent size.
5119544	5122807	Okay, I'll bring it next week and put it on the cam so everyone can see.
5123267	5123647	Alright.
5123907	5125428	But, you know where I hate tactics games?
5126249	5127570	I love Rortypes.
5127730	5130252	So it cancels each other out and you're ambivalent about the game.
5130692	5133573	I was like, I have an R-type thingy.
5133933	5135574	But no, Radiant Silvergun is treasure.
5136695	5140456	And I should do nothing but treasure games for the next couple weeks, but I don't know.
5141196	5144018	It's not the game I was actually going to originally do either.
5144398	5150580	You know, I'm going to have to help you out one of these weeks because I need to start seeing some Commodore 64 11 in these classic games of the week.
5151241	5151821	No, that's all right.
5152121	5153061	We've had a lot of good games.
5153081	5154642	Why don't you do it next week?
5154702	5154962	I'll wait.
5155002	5156463	What system did Jamie not have?
5157059	5157840	Commodore 64.
5157960	5158180	Right.
5158720	5159901	We'll wait for a week you're not here.
5160561	5163423	Because they'll come up before the end of the year at some point.
5163443	5165525	But is this not the most awesome thing ever?
5165745	5166746	It is a very cool looking game.
5166766	5167806	You want to know a secret?
5167826	5168607	I've never played this game.
5168947	5169287	I played it.
5169488	5171589	The only time I've actually played this game is in an arcade.
5171689	5175752	You know, whenever we actually get our little Justin TV idea off the ground, we need to do that.
5176112	5176672	Because I need to play it.
5176692	5177833	You know what I did the very next day?
5177933	5178254	What's that?
5178614	5179775	I had lunch with sauce.
5181201	5182341	It was in Las Vegas.
5182521	5184202	Very nice.
5184242	5185262	I have to say that on the air.
5206821	5207161	Awesome.
5207742	5209583	And more gaming news.
5209623	5210744	It's a very full show tonight.
5211004	5213986	We will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
